The Luciferic hosts from the celestial hierarchy \"fell\" to Earth as a regression in their own spiritual development. This \"fall\" was due to the selfishness of the Luciferic hosts developed through their jealousy and lust for the power of God. Selfishness cannot exist in the spiritual world and thus, Lucifer's desires created the necessity for the \"fall\" of one of the greatest angels of heaven. Lucifer's light is selfish, self-effulgent, non-radiant, and devoid of the magical substances and power of God's true light that is found in the Sun's warmth, radiant light, harmony of the spheres, and life. Lucifer's light lacks the spiritual nourishment that humans derive from solar light, which is ruled by the second Logos of the Holy Trinity - Christ. The Archangel Michael cast Lucifer out of heaven and it is Christ that battles Lucifer's deluded light on Earth that tries to lure human thinking into the same selfish, downward path into \"dark light\" that Lucifer began. This darkness is alive and is the antithesis of light that gives life. Lucifer's light leads into dark caves of delusion and mental illness - which is one of the earmarks of materialistic scientists who are following the same path of perdition that Lucifer and his hosts followed. Ancient civilizations described this battle between living light and living darkness in many wonderful ways. The ancient Greeks believed that after visiting the healing temple of Asclepius, where they slept overnight and reported their dreams to the temple priest in the morning, it was the \"light of Helios\" that would heal the illness that came out of the darkness of the night. After the dreams revealed of the cause of illness, it was sunlight (Helios) that healed the illness. Illness was bred in the darkness and healed in the light. In ancient Persian, the priest-king Zarathustra taught that the light of the Sun was a being named Ahura Mazdao who lived on the Sun but, at that time, could be encountered in the living rays of the Sun shinning down into the darkness of the Earth. The darkness of the Earth was ruled by the living being of darkness called Angri Manu, or Ahriman. Ahriman was seen as the collective forces of darkness that ruled illness, old age, entropy, and death. The battle between these dual forces of nature was continuous and the prize was the soul and spirit of each human being. In modern times, misguided materialistic scientists only believe temporarily in their personal, limited theories and have an aversion to attributing \"life\" to light, or basically anything else. These unimaginative and immoral theories lack wisdom and, in fact, are being inspired by living beings of darkness who have \"fallen\" from the ranks of the hierarchy. The \"unfallen\" hierarchy selflessly donate their shadow substance to create the Earth and all natural materials we see in the cosmos by slowing the frequency of light down enough to crystalize into material substance. Contrary to this self-sacrifice of the good hierarchical beings, \"fallen\" beings of darkness selfishly try to steal the spiritual substance of human beings to build a world of evil in the sub-natural realms by capturing light and denaturing its living substance into its evil counterpart. Both of these worlds, light and dark, are generally \"invisible\" to human sense perception which science limits to the \"five materialistic senses\", ignoring the other seven senses. Humans are beings of love and freedom and must make a choice between living light filled with wisdom or the living darkness that lures the soul into selfish pursuits leading to delusion, soul-illness, and spiritual death. It is the challenge of our apocalyptic times to decide to either be conscious and evolve into the planned spiritual ascension of the soul and spirit or be mesmerized by the dark magic of scientists and doctors who try to selfishly play god with the future of human evolution. It seems so wonderful, fresh, and delightful that scientists now claim that they can do god-like medical procedures with \"light\" that can alter DNA, RNA, and the natural processes of the human body. They call it photonic medicine and doctors have many medical treatments available that address issues from skin and teeth problems to biomodulation of brain neural pathways and DNA manipulation. To date, none of these treatments are approved nor has there been adequate research to determine the side-effects of these treatments. Under the auspices of \"light\", which is generally seen as a good thing, psychotic-scientists have immorally snuck \"living darkness\" intentions into these \"supposedly harmless\" treatments with man-made light. In actual fact, there is no end to the problems that \"wannabe god\" doctors and scientists have already created with photonic medicine. In an effort to shed spiritual light on this impending disaster of pseudo-medicine we present below some of the \"non-approved\" medical treatments that immoral doctors, using untested light-treatments, are now foisting on humans without informed consent or any care for the health and wellbeing of their patients. Of course, this is nothing new to allopathic medicine that is responsible for the third highest cause of death in America - iatrogenic death (death by doctor). Many would argue that doctor induced death is actually the number one cause of death in America. Reading about the mad-scientist's medical treatments (experimentations) involving \"light\", which are enumerated below, will give a sample of where this new Frankenstein medicine is headed. It is the same place many other types of treatments and drug therapies have already gone - into the hands of dark beings who wish to destroy humanity, not heal it. Photomedicine Photomedicine is a type of biotechnology that specializes in the therapeutic application of light - \"light medicine.\" It uses non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation in dermatology, oncology, surgery, radiology, DNA manipulation, and diagnostics. The fundamental particle of light is referred to as a photon. Photons are both a particle and a wave. They are deemed to carry no charge and have no mass. In a biological system, photons are emitted when electrons move from one energy state to another. Photomedicine is used to treat various conditions, such as tissue injuries, psoriasis, seasonal affective disorder, and other circadian rhythm disorders, cancer and tumors, and alopecia. Weak emission of light from cells in a living organism were discovered by the Russian embryologist Alexander Gurwitsh in 1926, who called them mitogenetic rays. Half a century later, the German researcher Fritz Albert Popp, a Nobel Prize nominee in Physics, re-confirmed their existence and established the term biophoton. Popp experimentally demonstrated that dozens of photons of light are emitted every second from every square centimeter of biological area. Popp proved that biophoton emission is not confined to thermal radiation or bioluminescence. Light Therapy Light therapy - or phototherapy, classically referred to as heliotherapy - is a method recognized by scientific medicine for the treatment of various diseases. It includes exposure to outdoor daylight or specific indoor artificial light sources. The care guideline for unipolar depression recommends light therapy especially for depression that follows a seasonal pattern (seasonal affective disorder). There is tentative evidence to support its use to treat depressive disorders that are not seasonally dependent. As a treatment for disorders of the skin, the second kind of light therapy, called ultraviolet light therapy, is meant to treat neurodermatitis, psoriasis, acne vulgaris, eczema and neonatal jaundice. a form of phototherapy using nontoxic light-sensitive compounds that are exposed selectively to light, whereupon they become toxic to targeted malignant and other diseased cells. One of the treatments is using blue light with aminolevulinic acid for the treatment of actinic keratosis. Some light therapy use either a light box which emits up to 10,000 lux of light at a specified distance, much brighter than a customary lamp, or a lower intensity of specific wavelengths of light from the blue (460 nm) to the green (525 nm) areas of the visible spectrum. A 1995 study showed that green light therapy at doses of 350 lux produces melatonin suppression and phase shifts equivalent to 10,000 lux white light therapy, but another study published in May 2010 suggests that the blue light often used for SAD treatment should perhaps be replaced by green or white illumination, because of a possible involvement of the cones in melatonin suppression. Contraindications to light therapy for seasonal affective disorder include conditions that might render the eyes more vulnerable to phototoxicity, tendency toward mania, photosensitive skin conditions, or use of a photosensitizing herb (such as St. John's wort) or medication. Patients with porphyria should avoid most forms of light therapy. Patients on certain drugs such as methotrexate or chloroquine should use caution with light therapy as there is a chance that these drugs could cause porphyria.[citation needed] Side effects of light therapy for sleep phase disorders include jumpiness or jitteriness, headache, eye irritation and nausea. Some non-depressive physical complaints, such as poor vision and skin rash or irritation, may improve with light therapy. Light therapy treats: vitamin D deficiency, skin conditions, acne vulgaris, atopic dermatitis, cancer, psoriasis, vitiligo, wound healing, retinal conditions seasonal affective disorder, non-seasonal depression, chronic circadian rhythm sleep disorders, jet lag, situational CRSD, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's sleep disorders, neonatal jaundice. Diagnostic Photomedicine Diagnostic photomedicine involves the use of light for various imaging technologies, e.g. X-ray, MRI, and PET. Other forms of photomedicine include photodynamic therapy (PDT), low-level laser therapy (LLLT), and LED therapy. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment that involves light-sensitive medicine and a light source to destroy abnormal cells. It can be used to treat some skin and eye conditions, as well as certain types of cancer. Photodynamic therapy can be used to treat abnormal cells in parts of the body that a light source can reach, such as the skin, eyes, mouth, food pipe, esophagus, and lungs. Common conditions treated with PDT include: actinic keratoses, Bowen's disease, basal cell carcinoma, macular degeneration, esophageal cancer, mouth cancer, lung cancer, warts, acne and Paget's disease. When some photomedicines (templated graphene oxide) are exposed to the light, they activate and cause a reaction that damages nearby cells. This allows small abnormal areas of tissue to be treated without the need for surgery. Infrared light can heal cells and tissue while ultraviolet kills cells and tissue and is particularly effective at \"turning off\" targeted genes with the use of luciferase and luciferin. Bioluminescence is the outcome of the oxidation of luciferin and the enzyme luciferase. This is exemplified by bioluminescent organisms such as the firefly. Using light to turn DNA on and off effects the fields of DNA biotechnologies, synthetic biology, and epigenetics. Controlling the Brain Through Light After several independent studies demonstrated that living cells do not just radiate light, they also absorb light, scientists are now investigating the existence of a new form of communication using light. Biophotons could offer that supplementary signaling pathway next to electrical and chemical pathways for intra- and intercellular communication. It is known that photosensitive biomolecules of cells and neurons can absorb biophotons and transfer the absorbed biophotons energy to nearby biomolecules by resonance energy transfer, which can induce conformation changes and trigger complex signal processes in cells and between cells. Indeed, hollow microtubules with constant inner diameters inside the brain could act as optical fibers for biophoton transmission within brain nerve cells. A significant relationship between the fluctuation function of microtubules due to biophotons emission and alpha-EEG has been detected. It has been suggested that the major source of biophotons is the DNA. The first supporting fact is that cells emit biophotons even when the cytoplasm is damaged, however when the nuclei is removed, biophoton emission stops. Red blood cells, which have no active chromatine (DNA) are the only cells which do not emit biophotons. The mechanism of biophoton absorption, storage and emission is however not well understood. Photomedicine has been particularly effective at regenerating frayed DNA telomere. This ability for DNA repair indicates the possible medicines of the future. Some of the most effective pain relief comes from application of LED light, infrared light, and laser light directly to the effected area. These devices are over-the-counter \"light medicine.\" In effect, light heals and the use of light-absorbing graphene oxide, in all of its forms, kills. Photobiomodulation Low-level laser therapy (LLLT), cold laser therapy, or photobiomodulation (PBM) is a form of medicine that applies low-level (low-power) lasers or light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to the surface of the body. Whereas high-power lasers are used in laser medicine to cut or destroy tissue, it is claimed that application of low-power lasers relieves pain or stimulates and enhances cell function. The effects appear to be limited to a specified set of wavelengths, and administering LLLT below the dose range does not appear to be effective. Photochemical reactions are well known in biological research, and LLLT make use of the first law in photochemistry: light must be absorbed by a chemical substance in order for a photochemical reaction to take place. In LLLT that chemical substance is represented by the respiratory enzyme cytochrome c oxidase which is involved in the electron transport chain in mitochondria. Various LLLT devices have been promoted for use in treatment of several musculoskeletal conditions including carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. They have also been promoted for temporomandibular joint disorders, wound healing, smoking cessation, and tuberculosis. LLLT appears to be effective for preventing oral mucositis in recipients of a stem cell transplant with chemotherapy. In other areas, evidence for LLLT remains conflicted. Some studies suggest that LLLT may be modestly effective, in relieving short-term pain for rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, hair loss, brain injuries, cancer treatment, chronic low back pain, acute and chronic neck pain, tendinopathy, and possibly, chronic joint disorders. The evidence for LLLT being useful in dentistry, and in the treatment of wound healing is experimental. Brain Photobiomodulation Brain photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy using red to near-infrared (NIR) light is an innovative treatment for a wide range of neurological and psychological conditions. Red/NIR light is able to stimulate complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (cytochrome c oxidase) and increase ATP synthesis. Moreover, light absorption by ion channels results in release of Ca2+ and leads to activation of transcription factors and gene expression. Brain PBM therapy enhances the metabolic capacity of neurons and stimulates anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant responses, as well as neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. Its therapeutic role in disorders such as dementia and Parkinson's disease, as well as to treat stroke, brain trauma, and depression has gained increasing interest. In the transcranial PBM approach, delivering a sufficient dose to achieve optimal stimulation is challenging due to exponential attenuation of light penetration in tissue. Alternative approaches such as intracranial and intranasal light delivery methods have been suggested to overcome this limitation. Fluorescence Biomodulation Fluorescence biomodulation is a form of photobiomodulation, which utilizes fluorescence energy to induce multiple transduction pathways that can modulate biological processes through the activation of photoacceptors found within many different cell and tissue types. Photoacceptors are molecules that do not explicitly specialize in light absorption but possess the ability to do so in the presence of light which in turn can enhance their functioning. To generate fluorescence, specialized light absorbing molecules (chromophores) are employed to translate light energy into a high-energy emission of fluorescence through a mechanism known as stokes shift. Fluorescence biomodulation differs from photobiomodulation in that it employs fluorescence as a photo vehicle to induce biomodulation. Fluorescence, as generated by chromophores, is displayed as a broad spectral distribution of wavelengths and/or frequencies which can be controlled to penetrate tissues to various degrees. Tailoring fluorescence biomodulation allows compatibility between the specific emissions of fluorescence and the unique light absorbing characteristics of different cell and tissue types in the body. Shorter wavelengths (<600 nm) within the visible spectrum cannot penetrate deep into tissue and are localized within the epidermis or dermis. Conversely, longer wavelengths (>600 nm) within the visible spectrum penetrate further up into the hypodermis. Blood irradiation therapy is an alternative medical procedure in which the blood is exposed to low level light (often laser light) for therapeutic reasons. The practice was originally developed in the United States, but most recent research on it has been conducted in Germany (by UV lamps) and in Russia (in all variants). Low-level laser therapy has been tested for a wide range of conditions, but rigorous double-blinded studies have not yet been performed. Furthermore, it has been claimed that ultraviolet irradiation of blood kills bacteria by DNA damage and also activation of the immune system. Red Light Therapy Red light can reverse a condition called mitochondrial dysfunction, which is the root cause of rapid aging. Mitochondrial dysfunction occurs when the mitochondria, the energy producers of the cells, are unable to convert raw materials into energy. This condition has been flagged as a leading contributor to many chronic conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders and rapid skin aging since energy-depleted cells are unable to perform their functions and become more vulnerable to viruses and bacteria. Deep penetrating red light therapy restores normal mitochondrial functioning by stimulating the production of a cellular fuel called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). More fuel energizes the cells so they can perform their specialized functions, repair themselves, and replicate. Cellular senescence (the cell's inability to progress through the cell cycle) is a normal process that happens as we age. The reason that cellular senescence occurs is due to our telomeres shortening over time. Each time cells divide for growth or tissue repair telomere length reduces. When it reaches zero the cells can no longer divide and die. Red light therapy, in conjunction with maintaining a healthy lifestyle, will delay telomere shortening and potentially help them regrow. The negative effects of red light therapy include: mild to moderate pain, peeling skin, skin redness, crusting of the skin, tightness, swelling, itching, and acne flare-up. Dangers Ultraviolet light causes progressive damage to human skin and erythema even from small doses. This is mediated by genetic damage, collagen damage, as well as destruction of vitamin A and vitamin C in the skin and free radical generation. Ultraviolet light is also known to be a factor in formation of cataracts. Ultraviolet radiation exposure is strongly linked to incidence of skin cancer. Optical radiation of any kind with enough intensity can cause damage to the eyes and skin including photoconjunctivitis and photokeratitis. Researchers have questioned whether limiting blue light exposure could reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration. Light exposure is reported to suppress the production of melatonin, which affects our body's circadian rhythm and can decrease sleep quality. It is reported that bright light therapy may activate the production of reproductive hormones, such as testosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and estradiol. Light therapy is a mood-altering treatment, and just as with drug treatments, there is a possibility of triggering a manic state from a depressive state, causing anxiety and other side effects. While these side effects are usually controllable, it is recommended that patients undertake light therapy under the supervision of an experienced clinician, rather than attempting to self-medicate. Contraindications to light therapy for seasonal affective disorder include conditions that might render the eyes more vulnerable to phototoxicity, tendency toward mania, photosensitive skin conditions, or use of a photosensitizing herb (such as St. John's wort) or medication. Patients with porphyria should avoid most forms of light therapy. Patients on certain drugs such as methotrexate or chloroquine should use caution with light therapy as there is a chance that these drugs could cause porphyria. Side effects of light therapy for sleep phase disorders include jumpiness or jitteriness, headache, eye irritation and nausea. Because photobiomodulation was shown to stimulate the growth of cancer cells in cell culture studies and can also increase the aggressiveness of some cancer cells, some commentators have asserted that PBM may be contraindicated in clinical use in patients with cancer. Blue light therapy can potentially damage skin in a number of ways: - Induces oxidative stress, which can lead to inflammation and collagen degeneration - Disrupts activity of melanocytes, which leads uneven and excessive pigmentation - Contributes to photoaging, or skin aging induced by light waves (the same thing that happens when you spend time in the sun) - Weakens the outermost layer of your skin and delays its recovery from daily skin stressors - Reactive oxygen species damage DNA and cause breakdown of collagen and elastin, resulting in skin laxity, wrinkles and accelerated aging. - Interfere with your circadian rhythm and disturb sleep. It's well-known that sleep deprivation can cause changes to the skin, including dullness, swollenness, redness and the ever-dreaded dark undereye circles. "}
