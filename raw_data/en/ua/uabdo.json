Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 6.2 DHS notes the commentor's concerns. As described in Section 2.3.1, DHS's site selection criteria included, but were not limited to, such factors as proximity to research capabilities and workforce. As such, some but not all of the sites selected for analysis as reasonable alternatives in the NBAF EIS are located in suburban or semi-urban areas. Nevertheless, it has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas. An example is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, where such facilities employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of the NBAF. DHS also notes the commentor's concern and acknowledges the proximity of the South Milledge Avenue Site to the State Botanical Garden and the Oconee River. As described in Section 3.8.3.1.1 of the NBAF EIS, 80% of the site consists of pasture, and the adjacent lands consist of forested lands and small, perennial headwater streams. Approximately 30 acres of open pasture, 0.2 acres of forested habitat, and less than 0.1 acres of wetlands would be affected by the NBAF. However, construction and normal operations of the NBAF would have no direct impact on the State Botanical Garden as indicated in Sections 3.8.3.2 and 3.8.3.3. Only minimal indirect effects would occur from operations due to increases in light and noise. As stated in Section 2.2.2.5, the NBAF would develop a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC) that specifies operating procedures to prevent spills, control measures to contain spills, and countermeasures to contain, cleanup, and mitigate the effects of a spill reaching a water body. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 4.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern. DHS held a competitive process to select potential sites for the proposed NBAF as described in Section 2.3.1 of the NBAF EIS. A team of federal employees representing multi-department component offices and multi-governmental agencies (i.e., DHS, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and Department of Health and Human Services) reviewed the submissions based primarily on environmental suitability and proximity to research capabilities, proximity to workforce, acquisition/construction/operations, and community acceptance. Ultimately, DHS identified five site alternatives that surpassed others in meeting the evaluation criteria and DHS preferences, and determined that they, in addition to the Plum Island Site, would be evaluated in the EIS as alternatives for the proposed NBAF. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 8.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the impact of the NBAF operation at the South Milledge Avenue Site on the area's potable water infrastructure and general water resources. An evaluation of the impact from the proposed operation of the NBAF at the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative on the potable water supply and infrastructure is located in Section 3.3.3 of the NBAF EIS.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1216 Based on planned upgrades outlined in Section 3.3.3.3.1, no potable water infrastructure constraints have been identified for the South Milledge Avenue Site. In addtion, an evaluation of the impact from the NBAF operation on the area's general water resources, to include surface water and groundwater, is located in Section 3.7.3 of the NBAF EIS. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's lack of confidence in the DHS and concerns regarding safe facility operations. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. DHS believes that experience shows that facilities utilizing modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF, would enable NBAF to be safely operated with a minimal degree of risk, regardless of the site chosen. The risks and associated potential effects to human health and safety were evaluated in Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS. The risks were determined to be low for all site alternatives. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF, then site-specific protocols and emergency response plans would be developed, in coordination with local emergency response agencies that would consider the diversity and density of human, livestock, and wildlife populations residing within the area.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1217 Hollibaugh, James Page 1 of 2 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 21.0 DHS notes the commentor's question regarding wind rose data not being presented in the NBAF EIS. While a wind rose was not presented the data obtained from the NOAA website referenced in the NBAF EIS contains the wind speed, direction, and rain fall events for each hour for an entire year. This is the form that the data needs to be in to use the MACCS2 dispersion code. This data could be presented in the form of a wind rose however, the raw data is more accurate presentation than a wind rose diagram, which has to be interpreted. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 21.0 The calculation for inhalation is not in fact based on a 1 sec duration because the concentration is presented in terms of s/m3. The ground concentration on the other hand is in units of pathogens per unit area, so the ingestion route has to be estimated by considering the total area covered by the animal. The entire accident release is on the order of 1 hour (therefore at a wind speed of 1 meter per second the down-wind distance traveled would be on the order of 3,600 meters or 3.6 km). The modeled results were extrapolated out to distances of 10 km because that is the limit of the dispersion model used. The MACCS2 code is designed to estimate accident consequences and as such is a time-integrated model of the Gaussian Plume. The net result is that the concentration estimates represent the 95% confidence limits for the specified down-wind distances and as such do not translate into the typical plumes that are dependent on a specified wind speed and direction. The 95% confidence limits take into account all of the wind speeds and directions measured over the entire year. This estimate is therefore more conservative than assuming a specific wind direction and speed. The NBAF EIS has been modified to clarify this issue. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 21.0 DHS notes that the calculated values are based on a 5 km radius and not 10 km where the concentration of pathogens falls off precipitously. The NBAF EIS has been modified to correct this error.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1218 Hollibaugh, James Page 2 of 2 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1219 Hollibaugh, Ryan Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.2 DHS notes the commentor's support for the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 21.2 DHS notes the commentors statement. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 15.2 DHS notes the commentors statement. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1220 PD0061 August 13, 2008 Yes, My name is Lori Hollinger and I'm a concerned citizen living on the north fork of Long Island. I am very opposed to the bio safety level-4 that's being proposed for Plum Island. I am opposed to it because there are pathogens that will be studied that are contagious to humans, that can be passed on to humans. If there is a natural disaster, a hurricane, a tornado, or a terrorist attack, or any kind of disaster, which cannot be foreseen, there is no escape route on Long Island. Even though Plum Island is isolated, for those of us who are just a tiny distance away, we would be sitting in a parking lot if we ever had to leave for any reason. Therefore, I think it is a terrible choice for this area, and I hope you will be reconsidering the location of the facility. Thank you. 1| 25.1 2| 21.1 3| 17.1 Hollinger, Lori Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.1 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the Plum Island Site Alternative. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 21.1 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding potential natural disaster impacts to the NBAF. Sections 3.4, 3.6, and 3.14.3.2 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, address NBAF design criteria and accident scenarios associated with natural phenomena events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes. The NBAF would be designed to withstand the normal meteorological conditions that are present within the geographic area of the selected site. DHS notes the commenter's concern regarding potential tornado impacts to the NBAF. The NBAF would be designed and built to withstand the normal meteorological conditions that are present within the geographic area of the selected site (hurricanes, tornados, etc.). Given the nature of the facility, more stringent building codes are applied to the NBAF than are used for homes and most businesses, regardless of which NBAF site is chosen. The building would be built to withstand wind pressures up to 170% of the winds which are expected to occur locally within a period of 50 years. This means the building's structural system could resist a wind speed that is expected to occur, on the average, only once in a 500 year period. In the unlikely event that a 500-year wind storm strikes the facility, the interior BSL-3Ag and BSL-4 spaces would be expected to withstand a 200 mph wind load (commonly determined to be an F3 tornado). If the NBAF took a direct hit from an F3 tornado, the exterior walls and roofing of the building would likely fail first. This breach in the exterior skin would cause a dramatic increase in internal pressures leading to further failure of the building's interior and exterior walls. However, the loss of these architectural wall components should actually decrease the overall wind loading applied to the building, and diminish the possibility of damage to the building's primary structural system. Since the walls of the BSL-3Ag and BSL-4 spaces would be reinforced cast-in-place concrete, those inner walls would be expected to withstand the tornado. DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding evacuation due to an accident occurring at Plum Island. An emergency response plan that would include area evacuation plans would be developed if one of the action alternatives is selected and prior to commencement of NBAF operations. The need for an evacuation under an accident conditions is considered to be a very low probability event. Evacuation would not be needed in case of an accidental release of FMD because FMD is not a public health threat. Cats, dogs, birds and other non-cloven hoofed household pets are also not affected by FMD. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 17.1 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding transportation of pathogens. A discussion of the low risk associated with the shipment of infectious materials is provided in Section 3.11.9 of the NBAF EIS. Additionally, an analysis of accidental releases during transportation is provided in the NBAF EIS under Section 3.14, Health and Safety. Information regarding the existing road conditions andChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1221 potential effects to traffic and transportation from the Plum Island Site Alternative is provided in Section 3.11.6 of the NBAF EIS. An emergency response plan that would include area evacuation plans would be developed if one of the action alternatives is selected and prior to commencement of NBAF operations.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1222 12.3 6| 9.3 Holmes, Carol Page 1 of 2 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.3 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the Umstead Research Farm Site. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 21.3 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding the impact of a pathogen release on the local population, livestock industry, businesses and infrastructure. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, including releases due to weather events. The chances of an accidental release are low. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release based on human error are low in large part due to the design and implementation of biocontainment safeguards in conjunction with rigorous personnel training. For example, as described in Section 2.2.2.1 of the NBAF EIS, all laboratory staff would receive thorough pre-operational training, as well as ongoing training, in the handling of hazardous infectious agents, understanding biocontainment functions of standard and special practices for each biosafety level, and understanding biocontainment equipment and laboratory characteristics. Appendix B to the EIS describes biocontainment lapses and laboratory acquired infections. Laboratory-acquired infections have not been shown to be a threat to the community at large. As set out in Section 3.14.3.4 of the NBAF EIS, employees and contractors will be screened prior to employment or engagement and monitored while working, among other security measures. In addition, oversight of NBAF operations, as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the APHIS Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF, site specific protocols would then be developed in coordination with local emergency response agencies and would consider the diversity and density of populations, including institutionalized populations, residing within the local area. The need for an evacuation under an accident conditions is considered to be a very low probability event. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and emergency response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 19.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the safe operation of the NBAF. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS investigate the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur and consequences of thoseaccidents Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequencesChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1223 from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. The need for an evacuation in response to an accident is considered to be a very low probability event. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 20.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern about the human health and safety of the surrounding institutional residents. Section 3.14 investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. A site-specific emergency response plan would be developed and coordinated with the local emergency management plan and individual facility plans regarding evacuations and other emergency response measures for all potential emergency events includingaccidentsat the NBAF, and which would include stipulations for all special-needs populations. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 12.3 DHS notes the commentor's water quality concerns and DHS acknowledges the current regional drought conditions. As described in Section 3.7.7.3.1 of the NBAF EIS, the South Granville Water and Sewer Authority has 3 to 4 million gallons per day of excess potable water capacity and could meet NBAF's need of approximately 110,000 gallons per day, currently less than 0.4% of the Authority's total current capacity. The NBAF annual potable water usage is expected to be approximately equivalent to the amount consumed by 210 residential homes. The NBAF will be operated in accordance with the applicable protocols and regulations pertaining to stormwater management, erosion control, spill prevention, and waste management. Section 3.3.7.3.4 describes the SGWASA influent standards that NBAF would have to meet and Section 3.13.8 describes the waste management processes that would be used to control and dispose of NBAF's liquid and solid waste. Section 3.7.7 describes stormwater and erosion control management options available such as but not limited to grassy swales, retention ponds, pervious pavement, engineered filter fences and drop inlets, on-site reuse and potentially innovative technologies. Comment No: 6 Issue Code: 9.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern for air quality. The potential effects of NBAF operations on air quality are discussed in Section 3.4 of the NBAF EIS and includes the potential effects from incineration. Site-specific effects at the Umstead Research Farm Site are discussed in Section 3.4.7.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1224 Air pollutant concentrations were estimated using SCREEN3, a U.S. EPA dispersion modeling program. Conservative assumptions were used to ensure the probable maximum effects were evaluated. Once the final design is determined, a more refined air emissions model will be used during the permitting process. The final design will ensure that the NBAF %does not significantly affect% the region's ability to meet air quality standards.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1225 MD0135 7| 24.1 cont.| 1| 25.3 Holmes, Carol Page 2 of 2 Comment No: 7 Issue Code: 24.1 DHS notes the commentor's support for the Plum Island Site Alternative.

Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1229 Honigberg, Emily Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 15.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern. The risks and associated potential effects to human health and safety were evaluated in Section 3.14 of the Draft EIS. The risks were determined to be low for all site alternatives. As described in Section 2.3.1 of the NBAF EIS, DHS's site selection criteria included, but were not limited to, such factors as proximity to research capabilities and workforce. As such, some but not all of the sites selected for analysis as reasonable alternatives in the NBAF EIS are located in subburban or sem-urban areas. Nevertheless, it has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas. An example is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, where such facilities employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 13.2 DHS acknowledges the commentor's concern regarding wildlife populations in the vicinity of the South Milledge Avenue Site. The potential impacts of an accidental release on wildlife are addressed in Section 3.8.9. Although the NBAF EIS acknowledges the potential for significant impacts on wildlife in the event of an accidental release, the risk of such a release is extremely low (see Section 3.14). The ranges of potential arthropod vectors for Rift Valley fever encompass all of the six potential NBAF sites. The risk assessment in Section 3.14 takes into account the presence of arthropod vectors and the effects of climate on arthropod populations at each of the sites. The NBAF would provide state-of-the-art operating procedures and biocontainment features to minimize the potential for outside insect vector penetration, laboratory-acquired infections, vector escape and accidental releases. An analysis of potential consequences of a pathogen (e.g. Rift Valley fever virus) becoming established in native mosquito populations surrounding the South Milledge Avenue Site is specifically addressed in Section 3.8.9 and Section 3.10.9.1 as well as in Section 3.14.4.1 (Health and Safety). Section 3.10.9.1 discusses the relative suitability of the regional climate of the South Milledge Avenue Site to promote mosquito survival and virus spread based on the extensive discussion contained in Section 3.4.3.1 of the NBAF EIS. As such, the RVF response plan would include a mosquito control action plan, and the potential consequences of pesticide use in mosquito control would be evaluated during the preparation of a site specific response plan. It has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas and in areas with abundant wildlife. State-of-the-art biocontainment facilities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF. Research at the NBAF would include the development of vaccines for wildlife that could prevent adverse impacts from a foreign introduction.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1230 Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 21.2 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding an accidental release of a vector, such as a mosquito, from the NBAF. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. The NBAF would provide state-of-the-art operating procedures and biocontainment features to minimize the potential for outside insect vector penetration, laboratory-acquired infections, vector escape and accidental releases. Section 2.2.1.1 (Biosafety Design) of the NBAF EIS, provides a discussion of the biosafety fundamentals, goals and design criteria for the NBAF operation. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts each of which has the potential to release a vector. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release of a vector are low. DHS would have site-specific Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. In addition, oversight of NBAF operations, as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the APHIS Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Comment No: 6 Issue Code: 12.2 DHS notes the commentor's drought concerns and DHS acknowledges current regional drought conditions. As described in Section 3.7.3.3.1 of the NBAF EIS, the South Milledge Avenue Site alternative would use approximately 118,000 gallons per day of potable water, an amount that is approximately 0.76% of Athens' current annual average of 15.5 million gallons per day usage. The NBAF annual potable water usage is expected to be approximately equivalent to the amount consumed by 228 residential homes.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1232 Hope, III, Daniel Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.2 DHS notes the commentor's support for the Manhattan Campus Site Alternative.

There is no inconsistency. The risk results section takes into consideration the following (as stated on pages 3-426 - 3-427: \"Design considerations for these critical safety barriers are to limit facility damage as a result of design basis natural phenomena events so that hazardous materials can be controlled and confined, occupants are protected, and the functioning of the facility is not interrupted. Because the safety analyses determined that high-biocontainment biological materials are required for worker safety, a higher design requirement designation is appropriate for the safety equipment necessary to prevent a release. Given the risks posed by the potential seismic and other natural phenomena, accident provisions for design consideration of the facility structure and critical safety equipment should be consistent with those used for facilities designed to standards above that for the model building code requirements for essential facilities (DOE 2000; DOE 1996).\" 2. There is no inconsistency. The frequency provided in the Hazards Assessment (HA) results (Table 3.14.2.7-1) is based on the qualitative estimates of the hazard, which in this case is the tornado or high wind event. The HA scenarios were developed to bound the accidents and to be used as a basis for selecting those significant scenarios that were carried forward into detailed analysis. The results provided in Table 3.14.3.2-1 are the results of that detailed analysis as presented in Appendix E event trees. The reduction in frequency accounted for in the final detailed accident analysis relies upon the robust design taking into consideration the provisions set forth in DOE standards for high hazard facilities. 3. There is no inconsistency. The accident scenario was postulated to provide the basis for recommending upgrades to design from the current conceptual to later stages leading towards construction that criteria will have to be set to ensure that natural phenomia hazards (NPH) events do not compromise the facility integrity. The risk conclusions are supported in that an effective design and operation can significantly reduce the risks posed by NPH hazards. 4. There is no inconsistency. The statements are taken out of context - the risk evaluation, based on the current design criteria as presented in the Feasibility Study, indicated that NPH events could exceed the stated design specifications. The risk results therefore indicate the need for considering a robust design consistent with standards for high hazard operations. 5. DHS agrees with the comment that Section E.4.2.1 Earthquake could be renamed to be E.4.2.1 Seismic and High Wind Events. However, there are no inconsistencies or that there is no potential for being able to appropriate separate the issues and understand the risks. In terms of presenting the risks associated with potential low probability NPH events the analysis presented in the NBAF DEIS accurately describes both the likelihood of the phenomena and the potential adverse consequences, which provides the qualitative/semi-quantitative risk estimates. The comment would at first lead oneChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1237 to believe that there are errors and inconsistencies and therefore the conclusion is not defensible. On the contrary the analysis as presented is defensible in that the evaluation as stated in the document is based on the written information provided in the referenced Feasibility Study relative to design criteria. In addition, the analysis clearly indicates that the need for the design to be enhanced because of the identified hazards. The analysis demonstrates the need for robust design and the mitigated risk estimates presented in Chapter 3 Section 14 take the upgraded design into account. The presentation of results in Appendix E could be improved to address the perceived inconsistencies, however, this would not change the fundamental results, which were modeled in a extreme conservative manner. 6. DHS disagrees with the comment. The general misconception represented by the comment is that the high-wind event is the greater risk because pathogens can be transported down-wind. The analysis presented clearly separates the components of the risk estimates resulting from the NPH events. The seismic event is shown to be able to impact the entire facility, but lacks the mechanisms to cause the subsequent dispersion of pathogens after a release, while the high-wind event does not have the same potential for catastrophic destruction of the structure, yet does provide a mechanism for being able to disperse pathogens from the facility. Because these specific components were not quantitatively developed from the conceptual design the coupling of these scenarios into a single consideration of risk related to NPH events. Because the conceptual design criteria provided in the Feasibility Study were only criteria the analysis assumed that the effect on the facility would be catastrophic. This assumption is both bounding and conservative and clearly indicates the need for robust design and construction of the final facility.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact 3 of 5 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement 4 of 5 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement 5 of 5 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1241 Houlik, Lisa Page 1 of 4 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1242 Houlik, Lisa Page 2 of 4 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 26.0 The NBAF EIS uses a sliding scale approach for the basis of analyzing the potential environmental effects. Therefore certain aspects of the alternative that have a greater potential for creating environmental effects are discussed in greater detail than those that have little potential for effects. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 15.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern. DHS is aware of and has considered the presence of the health and correctional facilities, described in Section 3.10.7.1 of the NBAF EIS. The risks and associated potential effects to human health and safety were evaluated in Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS. The risks were determined to be low for all site alternatives. The need for a quarantine zone or an evacuation in response to a release, and particularly actions that would affect the special- needs populations of concern, would be a very low probability event. As noted by the commentor, the response measures discussed in Section 3.8.9.1 of the NBAF EIS relative to a release of FMD virus would not be expected to impact the health and safety of special-needs populations. A site-specific emergency response plan would be developed and coordinated with the local emergency management plan regarding evacuations and other emergency response measures for all potential emergency events including accidents at the NBAF, and would include stipulations for any special- needs populations including institutionalized populations. DHS notes the commentor's concern. A site-specific emergency response plan will be developed and coordinated with the local Emergency Management Plan regarding evacuations and other emergency response measures for all potential emergency events including accidents at the NBAF. The risks and associated potential effects to human health and safety are evaluated in Section 3.14 of the NBAF EIS. The risks were determined to be low for all site alternatives, and the probability of a release requiring a quarantine or evacuation is very low. DHS would offer coordination and training to local medical personnel regarding the effects of pathogens to be studied at the NBAF. Emergency management plans will also include training for local law enforcement, health care, and fire and rescue personnel. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 20.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern about the human health and safety of the surrounding institutional residents. Chapter 3, Section 3.14 investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents. Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. A site-specific emergency response plan would be developed and coordinated with the local emergency management plan and individual facility plans regarding evacuations and other emergency response measures for all potential emergency events including accidents at the NBAF, and which would include stipulations for all special-needs populations.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1243 Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 23.0 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding an accidental release of a pathogen from the NBAF and the establishment of that pathogen in native wildlife or vectors such as mosquitoes. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. The NBAF would provide state-of-the-art operating procedures and biocontainment features to minimize the potential for outside insect vector penetration, laboratory-acquired infections, vector escape and accidental releases. Section 2.2.1.1 (Biosafety Design) of the NBAF EIS, provides a discussion of the biosafety fundamentals, goals and design criteria for the NBAF operation. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts each of which has the potential to release a vector. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release of a vector are low. DHS would have site-specific Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. In addition, oversight of NBAF operations, as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the APHIS Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. An analysis of potential consequences of a pathogen (e.g. Rift Valley fever virus) becoming established in native mosquito populations surrounding the Umstead Research Farm Site is specifically addressed in Section 3.8.9 and Section 3.10.9.5 as well as in Section 3.14.4.5 (Health and Safety). Section 3.10.9.5 discusses the relative suitability of the regional climate of the Umstead Reserarch Farm Site to promote mosquito survival and virus spread based on the extensive discussion contained in Section 3.4.7.1 of the NBAF EIS. As such, the RVF response plan would include a mosquito control action plan, and the potential consequences of pesticide use in mosquito control would be evaluated during the preparation of a site specific response plan. DHS notes the commentor's views on the safety of the NBAF operation. DHS believes that experience shows that facilities utilizing modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF, would enable NBAF to be safely operated with a minimal degree of risk, regardless of the site chosen. DHS also notes the commentor's concern with monitoring for disease releases. DHS would have site- specific standard operating / monitoring procedures and response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. In addition, oversight of NBAF operations, as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the APHIS Animal Research PolicyChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1244 and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 21.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern that site specific operational, safety, security and emergency response plans are not included in the NBAF EIS. DHS prepared the NBAF EIS in accordance of NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and CEQ's regulations NEPA (40 CFR 1500 et seq.). The anaysis conducted in the NBAF EIS was based on conceptual design plans posted on the DHS website. More detailed design plans would be developed as the project moves into the final design phase. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF then site specific operational, safety, security and emergency protocols and plans would be developed that would consider the diversity and density of human, livestock and wildlife populations residing within the local area. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. In addition, oversight of NBAF operations, as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the APHIS Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern that all possible pathogens to be studied at the NBAF are not listed in the NBAF EIS. A current listing of pathogens to be studied at the NBAF as provided in Section 2.2.1 of the NBAF EIS includes Foot and Mouth Disease virus, Classical Swine Fever virus, Vesicular Stomatitis virus, Rift Valley Fever virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and African Swine Fever virus. All hazardous biological agents or toxins as listed for study or have the potential for study at the NBAF are regarded as select agents under the Possession, Use, and Transfer of Select Agents and Toxins, Interim Final Rule (9 CRF 121), and are regulated by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The responsibility for the management of the Select Agent Program is under the control of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). The research protocols to be used by the NBAF involving the study of the currently listed or newly identified select agents require registration, inspections and oversight of the NBAF by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) and the APHIS Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1245 Houlik, Lisa Page 3 of 4 Comment No: 6 Issue Code: 12.3 DHS notes the commentor's water quality concerns. As described in Chapter 3 Section 3.7.7.1.1, NCDENR determined in 1998 that a portion of Knap of Reeds Creek was only partially supporting biological activity. Currently, 5.2 miles from Lake Butner to Falls Lake is considered impaired for biological activity. The NCDENR ambient surface water monitoring program has documented elevated manganese, fecal coliform bacteria, and low dissolved oxygen in Knap of Reeds Creek. NCDENR is currently evaluating the need for advanced treatment options of current dischargers, as well as investigating potential contributing sources that may be exacerbating the stream's impaired biological activity. Chapter 3 Section 3.13.8 of the NBAF EIS, describes the waste management processes that would be used to control and dispose of NBAF's liquid and solid waste. Chapter 3 Sections 3.3.7 and 3.7.7 describe standard methods used to prevent and mitigate potential spills and runoff affects. Section 3.3.7.3.4 describes the influent limits at SGWASA; NBAF would have to meet sewage acceptance criteria and pretreatment requirements. Comment No: 7 Issue Code: 18.3 DHS notes the commentor's concerns about waste disposal. Section 3.13.2.2 in Chapter 3 of the DHS EIS for the NBAF addresses the wastes that will be generated by the operation of the facility including liquid wastes that will be discharged to the sanitary sewer (see Table 3.13.2-2), and waste solids that will be sent offsite for further treatment and disposal (see Table 3.13.2-3). As shown on these tables, all potentially infectious liquid waste streams will undergo sterilization followed by liquid effluent decontamination in biowaste cookers and all potentially infectious was solids will be autoclaved (if they are not heat sensitive) or undergo gas decontamination or liquid disinfection (if they are heat sensitive). Table 3.13.2.2-4 describes and compares the primary technologies that are being considered for carcass/pathological waste disposal (i.e., incineration, alkaline hydrolysis, and rendering). As shown on the table, all of these technologies produce sterile or noninfectious residuals. Further, Section 3.13.2.2 explains that all of the thermal, disinfection, and decontamination technologies used to treat any type of animal waste generated at the NBAF will meet the operational and validation criteria recommended in \"Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories\" (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and NIH 2007) to ensure effective treatment. Also, as discussed in Section 2.2.2 of the NBAF EIS, inadequate sterilization is prevented by operational training and the use of standard protocols and SOPs that help to prevent the type of human error that could cause inadequate sterilization. Moreover, Federal, State, and local laws, regulations, and permits (such as regulations and permits established under the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) govern the management of the wastes, emissions, and discharges that would be generated by the NBAF. Because the method of carcass and pathological waste disposal has not yet been determined,Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1246 Section 3.4. of the EIS (Air Quality) assumes that the treatment technology with the greatest potential to negatively impact air quality, incineration, will be used to assess the maximum adverse effect. Similarly, because alkaline hydrolysis would have the greatest impact on sanitary sewage capacity, Section 3.3 of the EIS (Infrastructure) assumes that alkaline hydrolysis will be used to assess the maximum sanitary sewage impacts.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1247 Houlik, Lisa Page 4 of 4 Comment No: 8 Issue Code: 25.3 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the Umstead Research Farm Site Alternative, the five mainland site alternatives, and the proliferation of BSL facilities.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1248 Houser, Barbette Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1249 Howell, Ronald Page 1 of 2 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.3 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the Umstead Research Farm Site Alternative.

There is no doubt, in my opinion that there are real dangers presented by NBAF being only .5 miles from my neighborhood. I shudder to think about how this will affect our property values. Please register my concern. Sincerely, Christine Huff1| 25.2 2| 19.2 3| 15.2WD0570 Huff, Christine Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 19.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site. Risks to human populations at each alternative site were evaluated and discussed in Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen from the NBAF is extremely low. Modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas. State-of-the-art biocontainment facilities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 15.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern. A discussion of the effects of the NBAF on property values was included in Section 3.10.3, which concluded that there is no empirical evidence that a facility such as the NBAF would reduce property values in the study area. It is possible that with the relocation of highly skilled workers to the immediate area, property values could increase due to an increase in demand. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1255 PD0320 August 25, 2008 Hi. This is Jean Hulbert from Manhattan, Kansas, and I would like to say no to the NBAF in Kansas. Among many other things, it makes no sense to put it anywhere, except on an island, considering how dangerous it can be. And, as far as I know, it's already on an island. So, I'm in favor of leaving it there. Thank you. 1| 25.4 2| 5.0 3| 24.1 Hulbert, Jean Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.4 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the Manhattan Campus Site Alternative. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 5.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern. As described in Section 2.4.3 of the NBAF EIS, other potential locations to construct the NBAF were considered during the site selection process but were eliminated based on evaluation by the selection committee. It was suggested during the scoping process that the NBAF be constructed in a remote location such as an island distant from populated areas or in a location that would be inhospitable (e.g., desert or arctic habitat) to escaped animal hosts/vectors; however, the evaluation criteria called for proximity to research programs that could be linked to the NBAF mission and proximity to a technical workforce. The Plum Island Site is an isolated location as was suggested while still meeting the requirements listed in the EOI.

Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 25.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the five mainland alternative sites including the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 24.1 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative and support for the Plum Island Site Alternative. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 3.0 DHS notes the commentor's statement. The South Milledge Avenue Site is currently zoned as \"Governmental\", and construction and operation of the NBAF is consistent with this designation. However, the Clarke County Comprehensive Plan designates the South Milledge Avenue Site as \"rural\", so an amendment to the comprehensive plan may be required. This information has been added to the NBAF EIS in Section 3.2.3. DHS and USDA would ensure that the NBAF operation at the South Milledge Avenue Site will comply with all applicable local, state, and Federal regulations and policies. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 27.0 DHS notes the information submitted by the commentor. Comment No: 6 Issue Code: 7.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the visual effects of the NBAF at the South Milledge Avenue Site, which are described in Section 3.2.3 of the NBAF EIS. DHS recognizes that the NBAF would be a distinctive visible feature and would alter the viewshed of the area. Comment No: 7 Issue Code: 13.2 Nighttime lighting has the potential to impact wildlife through astronomical and ecological light pollution. Lighting would have the potential for adverse impacts (i.e., repulsion and interference with foraging behavior) on resident wildlife immediately adjacent to the NBAF. The NBAF would employ the minimum intensity of lighting that is necessary to provide adequate security. Mitigation measures, such as the use of shielded lighting and minimum intensity lighting, will be considered in the final design of the NBAF. Mitigation measures would minimize the potential for wildlife impacts in adjacent habitats. Given the relatively low profile of the building and the use of mitigative measures, significant lighting impacts on migratory birds would not be likely to occur. Comment No: 8 Issue Code: 9.2Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1259 DHS notes the commentor's noise concerns. The NBAF EIS Section 3.5.3 describes the potential construction and operational conseqences from noise affects at the South Milledge Avenue Site alternative. Comment No: 9 Issue Code: 12.2 DHS notes the commentor's surface water concerns. The NBAF EIS Sections 3.7.3.2 and 3.7.3.3 describe potential construction and operational consequences including potential permitting and planning requirements for the South Milledge Avenue Site alternative. Section 3.13 describes the proposed NBAF's liquid and solid waste management options. Section 3.7.3.3.1 describes the South Milledge Avenue Site alternative as using approximately 118,000 gallons per day of potable water, an amount that is approximately 0.76% of Athens' current annual average of 15.5 million gallons per day usage. The NBAF annual potable water usage is expected to be approximately equivalent to the amount consumed by 228 residential homes. As indicated in Chapter 2 Section 2.2.2.5, the NBAF will be required to establish clear procedures for keeping spills from causing ecological or health problems.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1260 please remember that the local residents of Athens-Clarke County have overwhelmingly voted to keep this area rural which is not in keeping with an NBAF. Water \u007f S. Millege Ave. is closer to surface water than any of the other sites, so the potential negative effects are greater. \u007f Georgia is in a 100-year drought. This is mentioned in the EIS report but the report states that other water sources are currently being discussed so that by the time the facility is built the water issue will be mitigated. If DHS was counting on the Hard Labor Creek Reservoir in Oconee County I hope they are aware the plans for building that reservoir have just been dropped. \u007f Nowhere is it mentioned how much water will used to produce the electricity to run the facility. The water to produce that electricity will also be coming from drought-stricken Georgia. BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES \u007f Construction on the S. Millege site will destroy wetlands and some hardwood forest. SOCIO-ECONOMIC Accidental Release \u007f The S. Millege Ave. site is again mentioned as having a climate that sign ificantly increases the risk of Rift Valley Fever becoming established in the event of an accidental release. Our large tick and mosquito populations do not die off in Georgia's mild winters. TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION \u007f S. Millege Ave. is again mentioned as already having poor traffic flow and would be affected by construction and operation. The report states that the Georgia DOT-recommended modifications would help minimize those effects. Does that mean a 4 lane highway through our Green Belt? HEALTH AND SAFETY \u007f All sites are at moderate risk for an over-pressure fire. \u007f The EIS states that accidental or intentional release of pathogens is none to low. I find that statement amazingly arrogant. The most technologically well-designed, facility in the world cannot prevent human error. A recent study indicated that some of the major disasters in recent history may have been caused by lack of sleep - Three Mile Island, Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster and the Exxon Valdez oil spill to name a few. In the last month the media reported on a major security breach and a planned security breach at two similar labs. \u007f The General Accounting Office did not find any compelling reason to risk building this type of facility on the mainland. TAXPAYER MONEY AND STRESS Although this was not a category list in the EIS, I can't help but wonder how much money has been spent so far on employee time (federal and local) in meetings, sending out requests to determine interest, responding to that query, meetings and correspondence between officials, site visits, planning for and carrying out scoping meetings in every potential site. The Federal government's portion alone would probably have paid for the extra cost of building a new facility on the over 800 acres already owned by the government on Plum Island. The only site the GAO still recommends for studying deadly pathogens. As an average citizen who thinks all the risks and negative impacts listed above outweigh the benefits to my community, it saddens me to be in this position. I would expect UGA to mainly focus on the financial and status benefits this project would bring to them. I had higher hopes for our elected of 3 Comment No: 10 Issue Code: 21.2 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding an accidental release of a vector, such as a mosquito, from the NBAF. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. The NBAF would provide state-of-the-art operating procedures and biocontainment features to minimize the potential for outside insect vector penetration, laboratory-acquired infections, vector escape and accidental releases. Section 2.2.1.1 (Biosafety Design) of the NBAF EIS, provides a discussion of the biosafety fundamentals, goals and design criteria for the NBAF operation. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts each of which has the potential to release a vector. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release of a vector are low.

In addition, oversight of NBAF operations, as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the APHIS Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. An analysis of potential consequences of a pathogen (e.g. Rift Valley fever virus) becoming established in native mosquito populations surrounding the South Milledge Avenue Site is specifically addressed in Section 3.8.9 and Section 3.10.9.1 as well as in Section 3.14.4.1 (Health and Safety). Section 3.10.9.1 discusses the relative suitability of the regional climate of the South Milledge Avenue Site to promote mosquito survival and virus spread based on the extensive discussion contained in Section 3.4.3.1 of the NBAF EIS. As such, the RVF response plan would include a mosquito control action plan, and the potential consequences of pesticide use in mosquito control would be evaluated during the preparation of a site specific response plan. Comment No: 11 Issue Code: 17.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern about the traffic congestion in the area of the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative and the future impact of the NBAF operation on the area's transportation infrastructure. A discussion of the planned improvements to the area's primary transportation corridors of South Milledge Avenue and Whitehall Road to alleviate current and future traffc congestion resulting from the NBAF operation at the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative is located in Section 3.11.3.3.1 of the NBAF EIS. All planned improvements are per the recommendations of the Department of Transporation and the Public Works Department.

A discussion of the potential effects to deer populations from pathogens is included in Section 3.8.9 of the NBAF EIS. A worst-case scenario in which deer become infected with the FMD virus, disease-induced mortality and depopulation control measures could result in loss or reduction of local deer populations. However, from a historical basis, the effects of FMD on wild deer populations throughout the world are limited in that the virus burns it self out. In either case, white-tailed deer are capable of rapid population growth and would recover in time. The effects to the local community would be primarily economic in nature, from loss of livestock product export and recreational hunting (see Section 3.10.9). Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 12.3 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding water supplies. The NBAF EIS Section 3.7.7.3.1 describes operational surface water affects at the Umstead Research Farm site. The NBAF EIS Section 3.3.7 describes the Umstead Research Farm site's infrastructure and NBAF EIS Section 3.13.8 describes liquid and solid waste managment.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1264 1| 1.0 2| 25.3 1 cont.| 1.0MD0017 19.3 Hutchby, Elizabeth Page 1 of 2 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 1.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern about the mission of the NBAF. Chapter 1, Section 1.1 of the NBAF EIS identifies DHS's mission as the study of foreign animal and zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) diseases that threaten our agricultural livestock and agricultural economy. The goal or benefit of NBAF is to prevent these animal diseases from spreading in the United States through research into the transmission of these animal diseases and the development of diagnostic tests, vaccines, and antiviral therapies. DHS believes that experience shows that facilities utilizing modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF, would enable NBAF to be safely operated with a minimal degree of risk, regardless of the site chosen. NBAF activities, operations and research would be performed solely for scientific research and biodefense purposes. No bioweapons research would be conducted. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 25.3 No bioweapons research would be conducted as stated in Section 1.1. DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the Umstead Research Farm Site Alternative. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 23.0 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding the past use of the land on which the Umstead Research Farm site is designated. Section 3.2.7 of the NBAF EIS provides information specific to the Umstead Research Park site on the historical and current land use, local zoning and regulations that impact the site, and the projected impacts on the site and adjoining properties resulting from the proposed installation of the NBAF. If NBAF were to be constructed at the site, all appropriate steps would be taken to undertake construction in a manner calculated to meet public and workplace health and safety requirements. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 8.3 DHS notes the commentor's statement. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 19.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern. The impact from the proposed operation of the NBAF at the Umstead Research Farm Site on the local sanitary sewage system capacity and infrastructure is discussed in Section 3.3.7.3.4 of the NBAF EIS. Decontamination (killing or inactivation of bacteria and fungi and viruses, respectively) procedures have a long and proven history of effectiveness when facilities are well maintained and procedures followed. The design and operation of the NBAF at the Umstead Research Farm Site would prevent negative impact to the Sewage Treatment Facility infrastructure and treatment capabilities. Specifically, as summarized in Section 3.15 of the NBAF EIS, pre-treatment of liquid waste streams would be implemented as necessary to meet treatment facility acceptance criteria, therefore avoiding potential impacts. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1265 6| 2 Comment No: 6 Issue Code: 23.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern for green and safe facility design, such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. As discussed throughout the NBAF EIS, DHS is committed to implementing a low impact design (LID) approach for NBAF so as to minimize the facility's impact on the landscape. DHS will document, review and incorporate all appropriate new and/or revised information for the NBAF final design. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. Comment No: 7 Issue Code: 12.3 DHS notes the commentor's water supply concerns and DHS acknowledges current regional drought conditions. As described in theSection 3.7.7.3.1 of the NBAF EIS, the South Granville Water and Sewer Authority has 3 to 4 million gallons per day of excess potable water capacity and could meet NBAF's need of approximately 110,000 gallons per day, less than 0.4% of the Authority's total current capacity. The NBAF potable water usage is comparable to 210 residential homes' annual potable water usage. Comment No: 8 Issue Code: 23.0 DHS notes the commentor's question regarding the operation of the NBAF in the event of an electrical power outage. In the event of loss of the primary electrical feeder to the site, power would automatically transfer to the redundant electrical feeder without interruption of power to the NBAF. In the event of the loss of both the primary and redundant electrical feeders the emergency generators would start and restore power to the NBAF. The emergency generators are powered by fuel oil as stored at the NBAF site. The fuel storage has been sized to allow normal operation of hte NBAF for a 30 day period in the unlikely event of the loss of natural gas and both the primary and redundant electrical power feeders. In the event that only the electrical service is lost, the fuel storage would support the emergency generators for up to 60 days depending of the season. Should the power outage persist for an extended duration and replacement fuel oil not be available, procedures would call for the safe shut down, disinfection and quarantine of all NBAF pathogens. Comment No: 9 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's questions regarding the public availability and transparency of NBAF research. There would no classifed research at the NBAF, however there may occassionally be classified FBI forensics cases. Currently, the PIADC facility publishes research in publicly available research journals; NBAF would publish its research in publicly available research journals as well. Comment No: 10 Issue Code: 21.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the potential consequences from a NBAF accident or pathogen release as the result of human error. As described in Section 2.2.2.1 of the NBAF EIS, all laboratory staff would receive thorough pre-operational training, as well as ongoing training, in theChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1266 handling of hazardous infectious agents, understanding biocontainment functions of standard and special practices for each biosafety level, and understanding biocontainment equipment and laboratory characteristics. Appendix B of the NBAF EIS provides a comprehensive list of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratoryaccidents results, and consequences of theaccidents Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, including external events such as a terrorist attack. Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. As set out in Section 3.14.3.4 of the NBAF EIS, employees and contractors will be screened prior to employment or engagement and monitored while working, among other security measures. In addition, oversight of NBAF operations, as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the APHIS Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF, site specific protocols would then be developed in coordination with local emergency response agencies and would consider the diversity and density of populations residing within the local area. The need for an evacuation under an accident conditions is considered to be a very low probability event. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and emergency response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. Comment No: 11 Issue Code: 23.0 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding the handling and transport of packages containing pathogens. The general regulations governing the required NBAF handling and transport of packages containing pathogens, and a discussion of the low risk associated with the shipment of infectious materials is provided in Section 3.11.9 of the NBAF EIS. Section 2.2.2.3 provides detailed information on the handling and transport of packages containing pathogens. Additionally, an analysis of accidental releases during transportation is provided in Section 3.14, Health and Safety and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS. Information regarding the existing road conditions and potential effects to traffic and transportation from the Umstead Research Farm site is provided in Section 3.11.7 of the NBAF EIS. An emergency response plan that would include area evacuation plans would be developed if one of the action alternatives is selected and prior to commencement of NBAF operations. With regard to the shipment of pathogens, no specific transportation corridors have beenChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-1267 evaluated. Should a decision be made to build NBAF and a site selected, transportation routes would be identified in accordance with a standard shipment procedure with the route optimized for safety and security. Comment No: 12 Issue Code: 18.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern. Section 3.13.2.2 of the NBAF EIS addresses the wastes that will be generated by the operation of the NBAF EIS. Table 3.13.2.2 lists types, origins of, and pretreatment requirements applicable to the waste streams that will be discharged to the sanitary sewer. As shown on the table and described in the NBAF EIS, all of the potentially infectious waste streams to be discharged would enter a dedicated treatment system that involves thermal treatment (sterilization) followed by subsequent decontamination. In accordance with Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, documentation of the decontamination of liquid wastes generated in BSL-4 areas, and physical and biological validation of the decontamination process is also required.
