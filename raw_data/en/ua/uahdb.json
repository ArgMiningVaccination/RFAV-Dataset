Your Downtown Miami, FL Chiropractor Explains How Toxins can Cause Disease and Pain On common contributor to pain and bad health is the accumulation of toxins in the body. Many people who come to their Downtown Miami/Sunrise chiropractor to get holistic pain relief can improve their recovery with a detoxification program. Recent studies have found toxins more causative in diabetes than sugar. Toxins cause many inflammatory disorders such as joint and muscle pain, arthritis, allergies, asthma, autoimmune disease, hormone problems, leaky gut, auto immune diseases and cardiovascular disorders. Since WWII, between 75,000 and 80,000 new synthetic chemicals have been released into the environment, less than half have been tested for potential toxicity to adult humans. Recently the environmental destruction agency approved a pesticide found by FDA to cause brain damage in children. Many chemical and pesticide companies are also in the business of making drugs. The irony was not lost on me that it was the very same day that Syria was bombed for using chemical weapons on children a new dangerous pesticide was approved for general use exposing children here in America. 400 synthetic chemicals can be found it the average human body. Estrogen forming compounds have been found in the fatty tissue of 100% of humans. Many of these known chemicals are neurotoxins. In August 2007, the World Health Organization released a released a report indicating that over 30% of all childhood diseases can be linked to exposure to environmental toxins. Most functional medicine doctors are finding so much copper on testing that most professional grade nutritional supplements are copper free. The effects of copper are far reaching including acne, hair loss, anemia, anxiety, autism, candida, arthritis, attention deficit disorder, dysmenorrhea, male infertility, schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Most of these pesticides increase estrogen and prevent the elimination of copper. The end result of toxic accumulation in the body is inflammation and pain. TOXINS CAN CAUSE EXCESS ESTROGEN Excess estrogen is a major health risk for everyone. It can prevent proper sexual development in children. Normal sexual development in males is dependent on testosterone surges. This is why young males exhibit excessive aggressive behavior. They are not going to have normal sexual development if their bodies are toxic. Many toxins turn testosterone into estrogen and bad testosterones, preventing normal development and causing low testosterone in men. Excess estrogen is also increasing in young women, triggering early onset of menstruation in girls as young as 8 or 9 years old, and is often the cause of heavy menstrual bleeding in many women. Levels of zinc, and selenium as well as overall energy levels can indicate how adaptive and effective your immune system is. One great nutritional evaluation is [ a hair strand test](https://drlisaowen.com/hair-strand-testing/). Hair Strand Test Kits are available in our office and cost $160. It includes a complete mineral analysis, and many health practitioners claim that several of their patients have had their gray hair come back to their original color after following the protocol that is recommended with the test results. I personally haven't seen it. If you are suffering from panic attacks the answer is here in the hair strand test as well. You would be surprised that mineral imbalances and heavy metal toxicity can certainly be a large contributor. Hairdressers also have a very high amount of chemical exposure. I saw one recently that was sweating purple from her hands while on the detox. Many people have a poor ability to detoxify. That means your inherited genes just don't have the right recipe to get the poison out. If you only have the ability to prepare the poison for excretion and lack the ability to finish the job, that mid-stage product is far more toxic than the original poison. A lot of these poisons attack the brain and can cause dementia. The Xymogen detoxification program provides the nutritional and homeopathic support necessary to eliminate the toxinscompletely. Another favorite is Floressence Tea available at most health food stores. With the number of poisons prevalent in our food supplies, the air, and water these days, detoxification is essential. Many people are taking toxic medications for conditions that have been caused by poisonous toxins in the first place. Consider if Toxicity could be the cause of your health problems.
