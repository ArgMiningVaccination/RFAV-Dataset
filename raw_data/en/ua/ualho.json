With advancing age the GC and Tfh cell response declines, resulting in impaired humoral immunity. We sought to discover what underpins the poor Tfh cell response in ageing and whether it is possible to correct it. Here, we demonstrate that older people and aged mice have impaired Tfh cell differentiation upon vaccination. This deficit is preceded by poor activation of conventional dendritic cells type 2 (cDC2) due to reduced type 1 interferon signalling. Importantly, the Tfh and cDC2 cell response can be boosted in aged mice by treatment with a TLR7 agonist. This demonstrates that age-associated defects in the cDC2 and Tfh cell response are not irreversible and can be enhanced to improve vaccine responses in older individuals. Introduction Successful T cell-dependent vaccines induce the formation of germinal centres (GCs) in secondary lymphoid organs. The GC is a specialised microenvironment that produces long-lived humoral immunity that can provide protection against subsequent infection ( [Vinuesa et al., 2016](#bib95)). Despite the success of T cell-dependent vaccines to date in children and younger adults, vaccination is less effective in older persons ( [Govaert et al., 1994](#bib34)). This has been proposed to be a result of a deterioration in the magnitude and quality of the GC response ( [Aberle et al., cells clonally expand and somatically hypermutate the genes encoding their B cell receptor. This mutational process, coupled with subsequent affinity-based selection, results in the emergence of plasma cells and memory B cells that bind antigen with improved affinity ( [Stebegg et al., 2018](#bib86)). The GC response is a highly collaborative process that requires multiple cell types to interact at the right place and the right time: therefore, defects in one or more of these cell types could underlie the poor GC response observed after vaccination of older individuals. Both T cell-intrinsic defects and changes in the microenvironment have been implicated in the diminished GC response observed in older individuals ( [Yang et al., [Garcia and [Nikolich-ugich, 2018](#bib71)), but the precise cellular and molecular changes that cause the age-dependent defects in the GC response remain unclear. The GC response is absolutely dependent on T cell help. This is delivered by a specialised subset of CD4+ T cells called T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which provide survival and differentiation signals to GC B cells ( [Vinuesa et al., 2016](#bib95)). Tfh cell differentiation from na\u00efve T cells is initiated by priming by dendritic cells (DCs), which provide three signals to support Tfh cell formation ( [Krishnaswamy et al., 2018](#bib50)): al., 2017](#bib53); [Barbet et al., 2018](#bib8)), but migratory conventional type 2 dendritic cells (cDC2s) have been proposed as the dominant Tfh cell-priming DC subset after vaccination 2018](#bib50); [Durand et al., 2019](#bib23)). Tfh precursor cells form after interactions with cDC2s, and subsequent interactions with B cells support completion of Tfh cell differentiation and localisation to the GC al., 2014](#bib10)). Once within the GC, Tfh cells act as the gatekeepers of the B cell response by providing survival signals to the highest-affinity GC B cells, thereby regulating which B cells are able to exit the GC as long-lived plasma cells or memory B cells ( [Victora et al., 2010](#bib94); [Gitlin et al., 2014](#bib32); [Vinuesa et al., 2016](#bib95)). The selective help that Tfh cells provide is essential for the quality of the GC response ( [Victora et al., 2010](#bib94)), and for preventing the emergence of autoreactive B cell clones from the GC as long-lived plasma cells or memory B cells ( [Linterman et al., 2009](#bib57)). An impairment in the formation of Tfh cells has been implicated in the defective GC response in aged mice ( [Lefebvre et al., 2012](#bib52); [Sage et al., 2015](#bib80)). In this study we sought to identify the mechanism that underlies poor Tfh cell formation in ageing, and to test whether it is possible to reverse the age-dependent defects in Tfh cells. Here, we report that the circulating counterparts of GC-Tfh cells are diminished in older persons after seasonal influenza vaccination. This impairment in Tfh cell differentiation in humans could be recapitulated in 2-year-old mice, which had fewer antigen-specific Tfh cells in the draining lymph node (LN) after immunisation than younger adult mice. The defective Tfh cell response in aged mice was linked with impaired T cell priming by cDC2s: after immunisation, fewer antigen-bearing cDC2s were found in the draining LN of aged mice, and those that were present had reduced expression of the co-stimulatory ligands CD80 and CD86. Transcriptional profiling of cDC2s from aged mice revealed that they had a defective response to type I interferon (IFN-I) due to the reduced induction of Ifnb1 after immunisation. Topical application of imiquimod the of antigen-bearing cDC2s, their expression of CD80 and CD86, and restored the formation of antigen-specific Tfh cells in aged animals. This demonstrates that age-associated defects in Tfh cell differentiation are not irreversible and that DCs are a rational target to boost responses to vaccination in older individuals. Results Circulating Tfh cells are reduced in older persons after vaccination Circulating Tfh-like (cTfh) cells can be used in humans as a biomarker of concomitant GC reactions after vaccination ( [Bentebibel et al., 2013](#bib13)). In our cohort of 18-36 and 65-75 year-old individuals vaccinated influenza vaccine ( [Figure 1A](#fig1)), there was a five-fold reduction in the production of vaccine-specific antibodies in the serum of older persons compared to younger participants ( [Figure 1B](#fig1)), consistent with previous reports et al., 2011](#bib81); [Nakaya et al., 2015](#bib68)). This diminished antibody production with age was associated with reduced formation of cTfh cells that are transcriptionally and clonally related to bona fide GC Tfh cells found in secondary lymphoid organs 2017](#bib39); [Brenna et al., 2020](#bib16); [Hill et al., 2019](#bib42)). Prior to vaccination, the frequency of CXCR5+PD-1+++ CD4+CD45RA- cTfh cells was similar in the two age groups ( [Figure 1C,D](#fig1)). Seven days after vaccination there were significantly fewer circulating Tfh-like cells in older persons compared to the younger individuals ( [Figure 1C,E](#fig1)), representing an impaired induction after vaccination when to an individual's day 0 baseline ( [Figure 1F](#fig1)). Together, these data indicate that the GC-Tfh cell response to vaccination is impaired in older persons. Tfh cell and GC responses are impaired in ageing A major limitation of human vaccination studies is the difficulty of sampling secondary lymphoid organs after vaccination in large cohorts of people, and thus animal models are invaluable to understand the underlying biology. After vaccination there is an increase in the number of Ki67+Bcl6+B220+ GC B cells in the draining inguinal LN in both younger 2-3 number of GC B cells was ten-fold lower in the aged mice ten days after immunisation, compared to younger adult mice ( [Figure 2C](#fig2)). This corresponded to a reduction in GC size ( [Figure 2D](#fig2)) and reduced levels of antigen-specific in the serum of aged mice ( [Figure 2E-G](#fig2)), consistent with previous reports that GC and antibody responses are reduced in magnitude in aged mice ( [Kosco et al., 1989](#bib48); 2014](#bib58)). This deficiency in the GC response was coupled with reduced numbers of total CXCR5hiPD-1hiFoxp3-CD4+ Tfh cells prior to, and ten days after immunisation, as well as significantly fewer antigen-specific Tfh resources are listed in [Supplementary file 1](/articles/52473/figures#supp1)). This demonstrates that aged mice have impaired Tfh cell formation after immunisation, which recapitulates the age-associated defect in Tfh ( [Figure 1](#fig1)). [see all](/articles/52473/figures#fig2) T cell priming is impaired in aged mice The age-associated deficit in Tfh cells upon immunisation could be due to T cell-intrinsic changes with age, or due to the age of the microenvironment in which the T cells reside. After adoptive transfer of either TCR-transgenic TCR7 or OTII CD4 T cells from 2 to 3 month-old mice into young adult hosts, more than 80% of all transgenic CD4+ T cells had undergone one or more cell divisions after immunisation ( [Figure 3A-D](#fig3)). In contrast, when cells from the same pool of TCR-transgenic T cells were transferred into 22-24 month-old recipient mice, significantly fewer T cells had completed more than one cell division ( [Figure 3A-D](#fig3)). In addition to defects in T cell priming, Tfh cell differentiation of OTII CD4+ T cells isolated from 2 to 3 month-old mice was reduced three-fold ten days after immunisation in aged mice compared to younger recipients ( [Figure 3E-F](#fig3)), which was associated with reduced levels of antigen-specific antibodies in the serum of these mice ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A-C](/articles/52473/figures#fig3s1)). These observations indicate that the aged microenvironment causes impaired early T cell activation and reduced Tfh cell development. These data prompt the hypothesis that the reduced number of Tfh cells induced by immunisation in aged mice may be caused by defective T cell priming. [see all](/articles/52473/figures#fig3) Several DC subtypes, including LN-resident 1 conventional DCs (cDC1s), cDC2s and Langerhans cells, have been and al., 2018](#bib8); al., 2018](#bib50)). Of these, the migratory cDC2 subset has been suggested as the dominant Tfh cell-priming early after al., 2018](#bib50); al., 2019](#bib23)). Consistent with these reports, after subcutaneous immunisation with E-GFP the majority of GFP+ et al. (2016)](#bib36). These cells likely belong to the migratory cDC2s subset, as pertussis toxin treatment, which disrupts G-protein coupled receptor-dependent cell migration, resulted in a reduced number of these antigen-presenting cells in the draining LN ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F](/articles/52473/figures#fig3s1)). One day after immunisation, aged mice had half the number of total and GFP+ CD11b+ cDC2s compared to younger controls ( [Figure 3G-H](#fig3)). This was coupled with the reduced presentation of E peptide-MHC-II, despite normal total MHC-II expression on the cell surface ( [Figure 3I-J](#fig3), CD86, CD80 and receptor CD40 on the surface of GFP+ CD11b+ cDC2s was also diminished, indicating impaired activation of cDC2s with age ( [Figure 3K-P](#fig3)). Taken together, these data suggest that defective T cell priming in draining LNs of aged mice may be due to impaired antigen presentation and/or co-stimulation from the cDC2 subset. The cDC2 response to IFN-I is reduced in aged mice To determine whether impaired T cell priming in aged mice could be due to reduced antigen presentation by cDC2, we used mice that are haploinsufficient for MHC-II (H2+/- ), to mimic this age-associated phenotype younger mice. cDC2s from H2+/- mice present less peptide:MHC-II on their surface 22 hr after immunisation ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1H](/articles/52473/figures#fig3s1)), but do not have an impaired capacity to prime CD4+ T cells three days after immunisation ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1I-J](/articles/52473/figures#fig3s1)). This indicates that a reduction in antigen-presentation alone does not phenocopy the defect in T cell priming seen in aged mice, suggesting other age-dependent changes drive impaired T cell activation. CD80/CD86 co-stimulation is critical for both T cell priming and Tfh cell differentiation ( [Platt et al., 2010](#bib73); et al., 2015b](#bib99)). By partially blocking these co-stimulatory ligands using a CTLA4-Ig fusion protein in vivo, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in early T cell proliferation ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1K-L](/articles/52473/figures#fig3s1)). Moreover, Wang et al. had previously demonstrated that reducing the magnitude of CD28 signalling in vivo impairs Tfh cell al., 2015a](#bib98)). implicates the age-associated reduction in the expression of CD80/CD86 on cDC2s as a likely factor that contributes to impaired T cell priming and Tfh cell formation in aged mice. To understand the molecular mechanism that underpins the age-associated cellular changes in cDC2s, RNA sequencing was performed on sorted antigen-bearing cDC2s isolated from 2 to 3 month-old and 22-24 month-old mice 22 hr after immunisation (gating strategy shown in [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D](/articles/52473/figures#fig3s1)). Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated distinct clustering of samples with 47% of the variation in this dataset explained by age ( [Figure 4A](#fig4)). Gene set enrichment analysis identified one pathway that was underrepresented in cDC2s from aged mice: the cellular response to IFN-I ( [Figure 4B](#fig4)). This was driven by the reduced expression of the majority of IFN-I inducible genes in aged mice compared to younger adults ( [Figure 4C](#fig4)). A reduction in the IFN-I response in cDC2s was confirmed by quantitative Real-Time PCR (RT-qPCR) in cohort: Mx1, canonical IFN-I stimulated aged mice ( [Figure 4D-E](#fig4)). In unimmunised mice, the expression of Ifnb1 mRNA in the inguinal LN was not detectable. Six hours after immunisation with E-GFP Ifnb1 is expressed in draining LNs, but the induction of Ifnb1 expression was three-fold lower in 22-24 month-old adult by IFN and IFN cytokines which bind the interferon alpha receptor (IFNR), a heterodimeric complex of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 chains. Upon ligation of the IFNR, the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 transcription factors are phosphorylated and, in association with the interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), move into the nucleus to promote the expression of ISGs ( [Hoffmann et al., 2015](#bib43)). the ISGs Ifit1 and Mx1 in cDC2s were intact in aged mice upon ex vivo treatment with low levels of IFN ( [Figure 4G-J](#fig4)). This indicates that aged cDC2s are capable of responding to IFN-I and do not exhibit cell-intrinsic defects in IFN signalling. Consistent with this, cDC2s derived from bone marrow (BM) stem cells from an aged, 23-month-old mouse transferred into an adult recipient mouse, do not exhibit age-associated defects in number and activation after immunisation when they develop and reside in the microenvironment of the younger host ( [Figure 4K-M](#fig4)). Together, these data suggest that the poor activation of cDC2s in aged animals is not linked with cell-intrinsic defects in their IFN-I response, but rather with impaired early induction of IFN-I in their microenvironment. Many different cell types can produce IFN-I upon infection or immunisation ( [Swiecki and Colonna, 2011](#bib90); et al., 2019](#bib5)). determine which cells express IFN-I in the draining LN after immunisation we performed RT-qPCR for Ifnb1 in different FACS-sorted LN cell populations. that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and CD64+F4/80+ macrophages express the Ifnb1 16 hr after immunisation ( [Figure 4N](#fig4)). This indicates a potential link between age-associated defects in cDC2s and the reduced production of Ifnb1 by pDCs and macrophages. Previous reports have described an age-associated decline in IFN-I production by pDCs in both humans and mice ( [Stout-Delgado et al., [Agrawal et al., 2017](#bib4)). In line with this, we found that age-associated defects in cDC2 activation coincided with reduced numbers of pDCs in aged, 22-24 month-old mice compared to adult controls upon immunisation ( [Figure 4O](#fig4)). To understand whether the reduction in pDCs was due to the aged microenvironment, we irradiated aged mice and reconstituted these mice with BM cells from 2 to 3 month-old animals. This revealed that the reduced number of pDCs in ageing is not an intrinsic feature of aged stem cells, but is driven by age-associated changes in their microenvironment ( [Figure 4P](#fig4)). In these GFP+ expression of CD80/86 on GFP+ CD11b+ cDC2 cells derived from young stem cells were reduced in aged BM recipients ( [Figure 4Q-S](#fig4)). Together, this suggests that the poor activation of cDC2s in the LNs of aged animals could be driven by reduced numbers of IFN-I-producing pDCs due to age-related changes in their microenvironment. Older persons have impaired IFN-I responses after vaccination As observed in mice, the expression of IFN-I inducible genes is increased in the blood of people in the first few days following vaccination ( [Nakaya et al., 2011](#bib67); [Athale et al., 2017](#bib6)). Using from Henn and colleagues ( [Henn et al., 2013](#bib40)), an early IFN-I gene signature was identified after seasonal influenza vaccination in humans. This response peaks in the blood one day after vaccination ( [Figure 5A](#fig5)). We further curated this list of IFN-I responsive genes to identify those that are robustly induced in human blood one day after vaccination. Application of this curated IFN-I vaccination signature to another dataset ( [Franco et al., 2013](#bib26); [Nakaya et al., 2015](#bib68)) showed that these genes were induced in older persons after influenza vaccination, but to a lesser extent than in younger people ( [Figure 5B](#fig5)), similar to our findings in aged mice ( [Figure 4](#fig4)). We performed PCA of the curated vaccine-induced IFN-I genes to determine how much an individual's IFN-I gene signature had changed one day after vaccination compared to the baseline expression before vaccination ('IFN-I distance') ( [Figure 5C](#fig5)). Day one samples from young people clustered distinctly from their pre-vaccination samples, whereas older persons showed a diminished early IFN-I response, as shown by a shorter IFN distance between day 0 and day 1 samples on the PCA plot. The IFN-I distance was reduced by half in older compared to younger individuals (p<0.001). Increased IFN distances correlated positively with an increased neutralising antibody titre 28 days after vaccination ( [Figure 5D-F](#fig5)), demonstrating a correlation between the early IFN-I response and antibody titres upon vaccination in people. Lack of IFN-I signalling in DCs results in impaired Tfh cell formation IFN-I signalling has previously been implicated in Tfh cell priming and protective immune responses to vaccination in mice ( [Proietti et al., 2002](#bib74); [Cucak et al., 2009](#bib20)). Hence, we hypothesised that reduced IFN-I signalling in cDC2s of aged mice could be linked with defective T cell priming. Blockade of IFN-I signalling prior to immunisation significantly reduced the expression of CD86 on can partly recapitulate the ageing cDC2 phenotype. Furthermore, absence of IFNR in recipient mice results in reduced T cell proliferation of adoptively transferred IFNR-sufficient ovalbumin-specific OTII cells three days after immunisation ( [Figure 6C-D](#fig6)), similar to what had been observed in aged mice ( [Figure 3C-D](#fig3)). To formally test the link between IFNR signalling in DCs and Tfh cell formation, Ifnar1fl/fI:Itgaxcre/+ mice, that lack IFNR on CD11c+ cells such as and littermates were immunised with Alum. In the absence of IFNAR1 on DCs, there was a defect in Tfh cell formation seven days after immunisation ( [Figure 6E-H](#fig6)), without affecting serum early time-point ( [Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A-C](/articles/52473/figures#fig6s1)). This indicates that the lack of IFN-I signalling in DCs can mimic the age-associated impairment imiquimod boosts and numbers Our data demonstrate that cDC2 and Tfh cells from aged mice have impaired responses to vaccination. In an attempt to boost the response of these cell types upon vaccination we applied a cream containing the TLR7-agonist imiquimod ( [Reiter et al., 1994](#bib75); [Moore et al., to the skin over the immunisation sites (experimental set-up shown in [Figure 7A](#fig7)). Imiquimod treatment is known to antigen-bearing cDC2s month-old 7\u2014figure supplement 1A-B](/articles/52473/figures#fig7s1)). This was with a two- to three-fold increase in the number of total and Ifnar1-/- and Ifnar1+/+ mice revealed that the enhancing effects of imiquimod on cDC2 numbers and activation were largely, but not completely, dependent on IFN-I signalling ( [Figure 7H-J](#fig7)). This demonstrates that imiquimod treatment can boost the reduced IFN-I response, and revert the numerical and co-stimulatory defects observed in cDC2s from aged mice. [see all](/articles/52473/figures#fig7) Topical imiquimod treatment potently enhanced total and cell numbers in both 2-3- and seven days after immunisation ( [Figure 8A-F](#fig8)). This boost in Tfh cell numbers was not dependent on intact IFN-I signalling in CD11c+ cells, as topical imiquimod treatment enhanced total and 1W1K-specific Tfh cell numbers in Ifnar1fl/fl:Itgaxcre/+mice to the same extent as in Ifnar1fl/fl:Itgax+/+ control mice seven days after immunisation ( [Figure 8G-H](#fig8)). That imiquimod can enhance of IFN-I signalling in DCs indicates TLR7 stimulation has multi-faceted roles in enhancing Tfh responses. Together, these results show that imiquimod treatment can restore cDC2 activation and Tfh cell differentiation in aged mice. This was linked with a doubling of GC B cell numbers in aged mice, but not in younger animals ( [Figure 8I-K](#fig8)). Imiquimod treatment did not affect serum levels of antigen-specific antibodies at this early time-point when most antibodies come from the extrafollicular plasmablast Discussion The humoral immune response to vaccination is diminished in older individuals, at least in part due to defects in the GC response ( [Linterman, 2014](#bib58); [Gustafson et al., 2018](#bib37)). Here, we show that the formation of Tfh cells is impaired in older persons and aged mice. In mice, we show topical application of the TLR7 agonist imiquimod corrected the age-dependent defects in cDC2s and increased the formation of Tfh and GC B cells in aged mice upon immunisation. This demonstrates that the defect in the Tfh cell response in aged individuals is not irreversible, and can be corrected by exogenous stimuli. Supporting our data, a clinical trial has demonstrated that topical imiquimod treatment at the time of seasonal influenza vaccination enhances antibody responses to the vaccine in older persons ( [Hung et al., 2014](#bib45); [Hung et al., 2016](#bib46)). This, together with the data presented here, demonstrates that changing vaccination approaches is a rational strategy for improving vaccine efficacy in older persons, a challenge of increasing importance with the rising population age world-wide. Ageing has been reported to impair DC activation ( [Agrawal et al., 2007](#bib2); [Moretto et al., 2008](#bib66)), the production of IFN-I cytokines by pDCs in both humans and mice et al., [Garcia and 2018](#bib71)). In addition, Brahmakshatriya and colleagues have demonstrated that transferring activated, in vitro BM-derived DCs into aged mice can boost both the GC and Tfh cell response upon immunisation ( [Brahmakshatriya et al., 2017](#bib15)). Our study demonstrates that age-associated defects in the early induction of IFN-I expression, probably by pDCs and macrophages, results in impaired expression of co-stimulatory molecules on cDC2s. The impact of reduced IFN-I stimulation on cDC2s in aged mice can be multifactorial: in DCs, IFN-Is promote the expression of al., 2014](#bib35); [Hassanzadeh-Kiabi et al., 2017](#bib38)). These molecules have been shown to enhance the expression of Bcl6, CXCR5 and ICOS by CD4+ T cells, thereby supporting differentiation towards the Tfh cell phenotype ( [Cucak et al., 2009](#bib20); [Barbet et 2018](#bib8)). In particular, IL-6 production is reduced in DCs from aged mice ( [Brahmakshatriya et al., 2017](#bib15)), which may act together with reduced co-stimulation to contribute to poor Tfh cell priming in aged mice. In an attempt to enhance cDC2 and Tfh cell responses upon vaccination, we applied a cream containing the TLR7-agonist imiquimod, which has been shown to [Bottrel et al., mice upon immunisation. Treatment with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod at the time of immunisation restored IFN-I signalling in cDC2s in aged mice, increased their numbers in the draining lymph node and enhanced CD80/CD86 expression on their surface. This demonstrated that IFN-I is an important signalling pathway to target to improve cDC2 functions in ageing. However, IFN-I signalling in cDC2s was not uniquely required for the imiquimod-mediated increase in Tfh cell numbers in young mice. This suggests that other, non-IFN driven effects of imiquimod, such as IL-6 production, can Tfh cell [Sch\u00f6n and Sch\u00f6n, 2007](#bib83); [Walter et al., 2013](#bib96)). Alternatively, it may be that the induction of IFN-I signalling in cells other than DCs, such as B cells or Tfh cells themselves is sufficient to promote Tfh cells ( [Le Bon 2018](#bib54)). Together, indicates that the TLR7 agonist imiquimod can boost cDC2 and Tfh cells using more than one mechanism, reinforcing its potential as a vaccine adjuvant. In our experiments, imiquimod treatment rescued the age-dependent defects in cDC2s and Tfh cell differentiation but did not fully restore GC B cell numbers or early antigen-specific antibody responses in aged mice to levels observed in younger adult mice. This could be due to additional age-associated changes in other cell types involved in the GC and extrafollicular antibody 2018](#bib37); [Nikolich-ugich, 2018](#bib71)). The most obvious hypothesis to explain a poor GC response is that ageing results in cell-intrinsic defects in the GC B cells themselves. However, adoptive transfers of aged B cells into young hosts show that B cells from aged mice are capable of forming GCs in a young environment, suggesting that a B cell-intrinsic defect is not the cause of the poor GC response in aged mice ( [Yang et al., 1996](#bib102)). These data therefore implicate B cell-extrinsic factors as additional contributors to the poor GC response in ageing. It is noteworthy that both T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells and FDCs have been linked to the age-dependent diminution of the GC response. The GC response is negatively regulated by Tfr cells ( [Stebegg et al., 2018](#bib86)), that are reported to be increased in number in aged mice and this overrepresentation of Tfr cells may result in excessive suppression of the GC response in older animals ( [Sage et al., 2015](#bib80)). There is also evidence that FDCs, stromal cells which are essential for the maintenance of the GC, are impaired in ageing ( [Wang et al., 2011](#bib97)). FDCs in aged mice form smaller networks and present fewer antigen-containing immune complexes on their surfaces after immunisation ( [Aydar et al., 2003](#bib7); [Turner and Mabbott, 2017](#bib92)). This is likely to affect the ability of B cells to capture antigen for presentation to Tfh cells, which in turn provide B cell growth and differentiation cues. This suggests that the age-associated defect in GC B cell expansion in mice is linked not only with a defect in T cell priming but also with other factors such as reduced antigen retention on FDCs and increased suppression by Tfr cells. Several strategies are currently being used to enhance the response to vaccination in older persons, including modifications of adjuvants ( [Frech et al., 2005](#bib27)) or administration of increased antigen doses ( [Remarque et al., 1993](#bib76)). Hung and co-workers have shown that topical imiquimod treatment at the time of vaccination enhances the antibody responses to influenza vaccination in both younger and older persons ( [Hung et al., 2014](#bib45); [Hung et al., 2016](#bib46)). We have previously shown that the poor gut GC response in aged mice can be boosted by replenishing the gut microbiome with that of a younger animal ( [Stebegg et al., 2019](#bib87)). Together with the data presented here, this demonstrates that agerelated defects in the GC response are not irreversible and can be targeted therapeutically to improve immune responses in older individuals. Because imiquimod can correct defective IFN-I signalling and the associated cellular defects in cDC2s, and can also boost Tfh cell formation in aged animals, this compound could play a key role in improving T-dependent vaccine responses, especially in the older members of our communities. Materials and methods Human seasonal influenza vaccination cohort [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap52473?item=s4-1) The main research objective of the human seasonal influenza vaccination study was to characterise the cTfh and antibody response against seasonal influenza vaccination in humans in different age groups. To that end, peripheral blood was tested from 34 healthy UK adults (18-75 years of age), who were vaccinated with the trivalent influenza vaccine (2014/2015). Researchers remained blinded to sample age throughout sample processing and data acquisition, and samples were selected at random to be thawed and stained (2-10 samples per experiment). All human blood and tissue was collected in accordance with the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP). The seasonal UK influenza vaccination cohort was collected with UK local research ethics committee approval (REC reference 14/SC/1077), using the facilities of the Cambridge Bioresource (REC reference 04/Q0108/44). Written informed consent was received from all volunteers. Peripheral blood was tested from 34 healthy UK adults (18-36 years of age n = 16, 65-75 years of age n = 18) who were vaccinated with the trivalent influenza vaccine (northern hemisphere winter 2014-15). Blood samples were collected into silica-coated tubes (for serum) and EDTA-coated tubes (for cells) on the day of vaccination (prior to administration of the vaccine), day 7 and day 42 after vaccination, with approval from the UK local research ethics committee (REC reference 14/SC/1077), and using the facilities of the Cambridge Bioresource (REC reference 04/Q0108/44). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density centrifugation on Histopaque-1077 (Sigma), and then cryopreserved in freezing medium (10% dimethyl sulfoxide, 90% FCS, both Sigma) and kept in liquid nitrogen prior to analysis by flow cytometry. Cryopreserved PBMC were thawed and rested in complete medium (RPMI-1640 with 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin, all Invitrogen) for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. Cells were resuspended at 4 \u00d7 107 per ml, then Fc receptors were blocked using human IgG (Sigma), followed by staining with antibodies outlined in [Table 1](#table1) and analysis on a BD Aria Fusion cell sorter. A dump channel consisting of viability dye and antibodies to CD14, CD16, and CD19 was used to exclude unwanted cell types from the analysis of circulating Tfh cells (CD3+CD4+CD45RA-CXCR5+PD1+++), as previously described ( [Hill et al., 2019](#bib42)). The IgG response was measured by Luminex using magnetic beads coated with full length recombinant haemagglutinin proteins from influenza strain A/Texas/50/2012 (A/Tex12), as previously reported ( [Wang et al., 2015b](#bib99)). et al., 2006](#bib70)) mice were bred and maintained in the Babraham Institute Biological Support Unit (BSU), where C57BL/6Babr mice were also aged. No primary pathogens or additional agents listed in the FELASA recommendations ( [M\u00e4hler et al., 2014](#bib63)) were detected during health monitoring surveys of the stock holding rooms. Ambient temperature was ~19-21\u00b0C and relative humidity 52%. Lighting was provided on a 12 hr light: 12 hr dark cycle including 15 min 'dawn' and 'dusk' periods of subdued lighting. After weaning, mice were transferred to individually ventilated cages with 1-5 mice per cage. Mice were fed CRM (P) VP diet (Special Diet Services) ad libitum and received seeds (e.g. sunflower, millet) at the time of cage-cleaning as part of their environmental enrichment. All mouse experimentation was approved by the Babraham Institute Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body. Animal husbandry and experimentation complied with existing European Union and United Kingdom Home Office legislation and local standards (PPL: P4D4AF812). Young mice were 6-14 weeks old, and aged C57BL/6 mice 90-105 weeks old when experiments were started. All experimental mice were housed in the same room. H2+/- mice ( [Madsen et al., 1999](#bib62)) and their wildtype littermates were maintained in specific pathogen-free facilities at the University of Leuven. All experiments were approved by the University of Leuven ethics committee. Mice were randomly allocated into age- and sex-matched experimental groups by staff of the Babraham Institute Experimental Support Unit or on the online mouse colony management system. Blinding was not always possible due to visible phenotypic differences between aged and young mice. For ageing experiments, a minimum of 5 mice per group were chosen based on previous experience in the lab comparing GC responses in young and aged mice. Limited availability of aged mice was a restricting factor in our study design. A minimum of 3 mice per group were chosen for mechanistic studies, based on a literature-based assessment of the expected effect size between study groups. Due to limited availability of aged female mice, all experiments with aged mice were conducted with males. Other experiments were conducted with both male and female mice. All experiments were repeated 2-4 times. Significant changes were reproducible between experimental repeats. Some of the aged mice carried lymphomas or solid tumours which affected their immune system, these mice were excluded from the analysis based on the following criteria: Mice with visible lymphomas or large expansions of Ki67+ proliferating lymphocytes (as determined by Tukey's outlier test) were excluded. These criteria were in place prior to initiation of the study, as part of normal practice for the use of ageing mice at the Babraham Institute. Subcutaneous immunisations [Request a protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap52473?item=s4-3) Mice were Freund's Adjuvant (IFA). IFA (#F5506), HEL (Lysozyme from chicken egg white, #62970) and OVA (Albumin from chicken egg white; #A5503) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Imject Alum (#77161) Thermo Fisher and NP-OVA (#N-5051-100) were purchased from Biosearch Technologies. E-GFP fusion protein was isolated in-house from XL-1 blue E. coli carrying the pTRCHis-E-GFP vector using a protocol adapted from [Rush and Brewer (2010)](#bib79). Briefly, E. coli carrying the pTRCHis-E-GFP vector were plated from glycerol stock onto LB/ampicillin agar and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C. The next day, a single colony was transferred into 5 ml LB and incubated at 37 \u00b0C while shaking. The next day, these 5 ml were used to inoculate 1L LB. When the culture was growing in log phase, IPTG was added to a final volume of 1 mM. The culture was left to shake overnight at 37 \u00b0C, then the bacteria were pelleted at 5000 g for 15 min. After discarding the supernatant, the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 20 ml lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole at pH 8.0) by vortexing and incubated on ice for 15 min in ice. After five repeated sonication steps on ice at 30 W for 60 s, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 30 min. This step was repeated until all E-GFP was released and the bacterial pellet did not appear green anymore. The clear, green lysate was filtered first through a 0.45 \u00b5m syringe filter, then through a 0.22 \u00b5m syringe filter. Next, 200 ml of lysate were mixed with 4 ml of Ni-NTA agarose (QIAGEN #30210) and incubated at 4 \u00b0C. After one hour, the lysate/agarose mix was loaded onto 5 ml columns (QIAGEN #34964) and left to set. The columns were then washed twice with 25 ml of wash buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole at pH 8.0). The protein was eluted by four repeated additions of 2 ml elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM Imidazole at pH 8.0) to the column. The eluate was dialysed against PBS overnight in a D-Tube Dialyzer Mega 3.5 kDa tube (Millipore # 71743-4) at 4 \u00b0C. On the next day, the eluate was concentrated using Centriprep centrifugal filters with an Ultracel 10K membrane (Millipore #4304) by centrifugation at 3000 g for 30 min. The concentrated protein was collected, filtered through a 0.22 \u00b5m syringe filter and stored at 80 \u00b0C until use. The 1W1K-conjugate was generated from NP-e-Aminocaproyl-OSu (Biosearch Technologies, #N-1021-100), which was first conjugated to streptavidin (Sigma #S4762-10MG). The product was then conjugated at a 1:6 molar ratio of NP-SA to 1W1K-biotin (custom-made by Cambridge Research Biochemicals 'biotin-GSGEA-W-GALANKA-V-DKA-acid') for one hour at room temperature. Unbound peptide was removed by dialysis using Centriprep centrifugal filters with an Ultracel10K membrane (Sigma #4304). NP-1W1K was freshly conjugated for each experiment. Purified 1W1K-conjugate, NP-KLH, HEL and OVA were first diluted in PBS, then the same volume of Alum was added dropwise to the solution while shaking until a final concentration of 50 \u00b5g/ml HEL, 500 \u00b5g/ml OVA, or 30 min of vortexing, 100 \u00b5l of the emulsion were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into the hind flanks of recipient mice. 1 mg/ml E-GFP was emulsified in IFA by trituration through a 20 g needle. 200 \u00b5l of this emulsion were injected subcutaneously into the hind flanks of recipient mice. Mice were euthanised at different time-points after immunisation, as indicated in the main text or figure legends, when draining inguinal LNs were collected. Where indicated, mice were treated with IFNAR1-blocking antibodies (BioXCell to, or at the time of immunisation. IFNAR1 blocking was achieved by intraperitoneal injection of 0.75 mg of anti-IFNAR1 blocking antibody or the appropriate isotype control (BioXCell #BE0083) in 200 \u00b5l PBS 20 To co-stimulation, 10-100 were intraperitoneally to immunisations with HEL in Alum. For Aldara treatment, mice were shaved on their backs 1-3 days before subcutaneous immunisations into their hind flanks. Directly after immunisation, 50-125 mg of Aldara were applied topically to the shaved backs of the anaesthetised animals. The cream was left to absorb for five minutes before the mice were returned to their cages. Imiquimod-treated and untreated control mice were housed in separate cages to avoid cross-contamination by grooming. For pertussis toxin experiments, mice were subcutaneously injected into their hind flanks with 100 \u00b5l of 5 \u00b5g/ml pertussis toxin (Sigma #P7208) in PBS on days 0 and 1. On day 2, they received subcutaneous immunisations with 200 \u00b5l of 1 mg/ml E-GFP combined with 2.5 \u00b5g/ml pertussis toxin in IFA. 22 hr later, mice were euthanised and their draining inguinal LNs were collected for flow cytometry. Control mice were injected with 100 \u00b5l PBS on day 0 and 1 and were immunised with E-GFP in IFA on day 2. Adoptive T cell transfers [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap52473?item=s4-4) To perform adoptive HEL- or OVA-specific T cell transfers, total lymphocytes were isolated from the spleen and peripheral LNs (brachial, axial, superficial cervical, inguinal and mesenteric LNs) of TCR7 or OTII transgenic mice, respectively. These mice also expressed CD45.1+. All cells were stained using the CellTrace Violet (CTV) Cell Proliferation Kit (Invitrogen #C34557; 1:1000 in PBS) for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C, followed by two washes with PBS containing 2 %FBS at 1800 rpm for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. The percentage of TCR-transgenic CD4+ CTV+ T cells was determined by flow cytometry, detecting TCR7 T cells using anti-TCRV3 antibodies and OTII T cells with anti-TCRV2 antibodies. An equivalent of 1-5 \u00d7 106 TCR7 T cells or 5 \u00d7 105 OTII T cells was transferred intravenously into C57BL/6, or Ifnar1-/- recipient mice in 2% FBS/PBS. The mice were subsequently immunized subcutaneously into their hind flanks with 100 \u00b5l of 5-10 \u00b5g HEL or 50 \u00b5g OVA in Alum. An equivalent of unstained 5 \u00d7 104 OTII T cells in 100 \u00b5l 2% FBS/PBS was transferred intravenously into adult and aged C57BL/6 mice for the assessment of Tfh cell differentiation on day 10 after immunisation with 50 \u00b5g NP-OVA in Alum. Where indicated, mice were pre-treated 1, 50 or 100 \u00b5g CTLA4-Ig (Orencia Abatacept) in 100 \u00b5l PBS at the time of T cell transfer to block CD86 and CD80 co-stimulation. After three days, the inguinal LNs of each recipient mouse were harvested and pooled. They were mashed through 70 \u00b5m filters to obtain single cells which were then stained for flow cytometry. The antibodies used are listed in [Table 2](#table2). Bone marrow chimeras C57BL/6 mice) irradiated with 800-1000 rad in two doses and reconstituted via intravenous injection with 2-4 \u00d7 106 administered neomycin in their drinking water for the first four weeks after BM transfers and were used for experiments eight weeks after successful reconstitution. Flow cytometry [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap52473?item=s4-6) For T and B cell stains a single cell suspension from inguinal LNs was generated by pressing the tissues through a 70 \u00b5m mesh in 2% FBS in PBS. Cell numbers and viability were determined using a CASY TT Cell Counter (Roche). 1-3 \u00d7 106 cells were transferred to FACS tubes or 96-well plates for subsequent antibody staining. To stain for 1W1K-specific CD4 T cells, cell suspensions U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin) for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C. Then, a PE-conjugated MHC class II tetramer containing the NIH Tetramer Core Facility; PE-coupled 'I-A(b) EAWGALANKAVDKA') was added to each sample at a final concentration of 1:100 and incubated for 2 hr at room temperature. Cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain (Invitrogen #L23105; diluted 1:1000 in PBS) and incubated diluted 1:50 in 2% FBS in PBS). Surface antibody stains were performed for 1 hr at 4 \u00b0C in 100 \u00b5l Brilliant Stain Buffer (BD Biosciences #563794). For intranuclear staining, cells were fixed (#00-5323-00). Antibody staining and anti-Bcl6 antibodies was performed for 1-2 hr 4 \u00b0C in 1 \u00d7 Permeabilization buffer (eBioscience #00-8333-56). Samples were on stained UltraComp eBeads Compensation Beads data were analysed using FlowJo v10 software (Tree Star). The antibodies used are listed in [Table 2](#table2). For DC analysis, inguinal LNs were harvested and incubated with 10 mg/ml Collagenase D (Roche #11088866001) in plain medium (Gibco #11875093) for 15-30 min at 37 \u00b0C, followed by gentle pipetting to disrupt the tissue. Cells were washed with PBS containing 2% FBS, before cell numbers were determined using a CASY TT Cell Counter (Roche). After a wash in PBS, isolated cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain (Invitrogen #L23105; diluted 1:1000 in PBS) on ice for 10 min. After a second wash, they were blocked with FcR block (anti-mouse CD16/32; eBioscience for 10-15 min at 4 \u00b0C. Surface antibody stains were performed for 45-60 min at 4 \u00b0C in Brilliant Stain Buffer (BD Biosciences #563794). Samples were acquired on a LSRFortessa 5 and sorted with a BD FACSAria (both BD Biosciences). Flow data were analysed using FlowJo v10 software (Tree Star). The antibodies used are listed in [Table 2](#table2). To stain for pSTAT1,~2\u00d7106 cells isolated from the inguinal LNs of na\u00efve mice were seeded into sterile round-bottom 96-well plates in and 55 \u00b5M 2-mercaptoethanol (Thermo Fisher Scientific #21985023)). After a 45 min resting period, they were treated with 50 U/well recombinant murine IFN (PBL assay science #12105-1) with fluorochrome-coupled anti-mouse CD8a, B220 and CD11b antibodies. The cells were then washed and fixed with Cytofix (BD Biosciences #554655) for 30 min, followed by a 30 min fixation and permeabilisation step in ice-cold 90% methanol. After three washes in PBS, the cells were stained with anti-mouse pSTAT1 antibodies as well as anti-mouse CD4, CD11c, MHCII, CD172a antibodies for one hour. Samples were acquired on a LSRFortessa 5 and the flow data were analysed using FlowJo v10 software (Tree Star). The antibodies used are listed in [Table 2](#table2). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of GFP+ CD11b+ cDC2, cells from total draining LNs were isolated and stained as described above. 800-4000 GFP+ CD11b+ cDC2 were sorted into PCR tubes containing \u00b5l of RLT lysis buffer supplied with the RNeasy using a BD FACSAria or FACS Aria Fusion. For RNA sequencing, we sorted 800 cells into PCR tubes containing 8.5 \u00b5l of 1 \u00d7 lysis buffer provided with the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Clontech # 634890). To determine the IFN-I responsiveness of cDC2s ex vivo,~2\u00d7106 cells isolated from the inguinal LNs of na\u00efve mice were seeded into sterile round-bottom 96-well plates in 200 \u00b5l complete RPMI. After a 15 min resting period, they were treated with 50 U/well recombinant murine IFN (PBL assay science #12105-1) for 3 hr and then stained and sorted CD11b+ cDC2s as described above. To investigate Ifnb1 expression of different LN cell subsets we sorted different cell populations based on a gating strategy proposed by [Guilliams et al. (2016)](#bib36): cDC2s and Langerhans cells (CD3-CD19-F4/80-CD64-MHC-II+CD11c+Xcr1-) from the pooled draining LNs of 4-5 mice 16 hr after immunisation with E-GFP in IFA. To sort DCs and macrophages, LN were digested as described above and Miltenyi's pan dendritic cell isolation kit (#130-100-875), LS columns (Miltenyi #130-042-401) and a MidiMACS separator (Miltenyi) were used to magnetically enrichment for CD11c+ cells, by following the manufacturer's instructions. The DC-enriched cell fraction was stained as described above. All cell types were sorted into separate 5 ml tubes containing 300 \u00b5l FBS using a BD FACSAria Fusion. RNA for RT-qPCR was isolated from cell pellets using Qiagen's RNeasy Mini or Micro Kit (#74104 and #74004). Confocal of germinal centres [Request a protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap52473?item=s4-8) Na3PO4 (pH 7.4) (Sigma #342483) and 0.01 M NaIO4 (Sigma #210048), for 4 hr at 4 \u00b0C. After fixation, the samples were dehydrated in 30% sucrose (Sigma #S0389) overnight, embedded in Optimum Cutting Temperature (OCT) medium (VWR #25608-930) on dry ice and stored at 80 \u00b0C. The frozen tissues were cut into 10 m sections using a cryostat (Leica Biosystems) at 20 \u00b0C and again stored at 80\u00b0C. For antibody stains, the slides were first air-dried and then hydrated in 0.5% Tween 20 in PBS (PBS-T). Slides were blocked in 200 l blocking buffer (PBS containing 2% BSA and 10% goat serum), then permeabilised with 200 l PBS containing 2% Triton X (Sigma #X100). After three wash steps in PBS-T, the slides were incubated with 200 l of a primary antibody mix in PBS-T containing 1% BSA at 4 \u00b0C overnight. day, the slides were washed in PBS-T three times, then they were incubated with secondary antibodies in 200 l PBS-T containing 2% goat serum for 2 hr at room temperature. The secondary antibodies used were AF568-conjugated goat anti-hamster medium (National diagnostics #HS-106) was used to mount slides and coverslips were gently placed on top of the slides. Slides were dried overnight for the mounting medium to set. Images were acquired using a Zeiss 780 microscope using 10\u00d7, 20 \u00d7 and 40 \u00d7 objectives. Image analysis was performed using ImageJ. RNA isolation and quantitative Real-Time PCR (RT-qPCR) [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap52473?item=s4-9) RNA isolation from ex vivo isolated cells was performed using Qiagen's RNeasy Mini or Micro Kit (#74104 and #74004) following the manufacturer's instructions. Homogenisation of the samples was achieved by vortexing for 1 min or by using QIAshredders (Qiagen #79654). RNA concentrations obtained from the RNA isolation were measured using the NanoDrop system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific #4331182) for Ifnb1 (Mm00439552_s1) detects genomic DNA, so RNA samples were treated with the Turbo DNA-free kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific #AM1907) according to the manufacturer's protocol to remove any contaminating genomic DNA for RT-qPCR. cDNA was generated from pre-treated RNA samples using the Quantitect reverse transcription kit (Mm00487796_m1) performed the Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG (Thermo Fisher Scientific #11730025). In some cases, RT-qPCR using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays for Mx1 and Ifit1, which do not detect genomic DNA, was performed directly on RNA using Thermo Fisher Scientific's TaqMan RNA-to-CT 1-Step Kit (#4392656) following the plates template RNA or cDNA (10-50 ng per reaction) to 8 l of a master mix containing the appropriate TaqMan Gene Expression Assay. Expression levels were normalised to Hprt (Mm03024075_m1), which was found to be stably expressed under all experimental conditions. All samples were run in duplicates or triplicates on a BioRad CFX96 or CFX384 Real-Time System. The 2-Ct-method was applied for relative quantification of mRNA levels. Samples from young mice were used as calibrators. As above, Cq values were exported from the CFX Manager software (Bio-rad). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [Request (Thermo Fisher Scientific 96F Maxisorp #456537) were coated overnight at 4 \u00b0C NP7-BSA (Biosearch Technologies #N-5050L-100) in PBS. The next day, plates were washed 4 times in wash buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 hr at room temperature. After an additional wash step, sera were loaded onto the plates. The starting dilution for sera was 1:50-200 in 1% BSA in PBS. This initial dilution was titrated down the plate at a 1:3 or 1:4 ratio. The plates were incubated for 2-3 hr at room temperature and after another wash step 50 \u00b5l of polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG1 HRP-conjugated antibodies (Abcam #ab97240; 1:10,000 in PBS) were added for 2 hr at room temperature. The plates were developed with 100 \u00b5l/well TMB (Biolegend #421101) for up to 20 min, when the reaction was stopped with 50 \u00b5l/well 0.5M H2SO4. A PHERAstar FS microplate reader (BMG used to measure absorption at 450 nm. Absorbance values from serially diluted samples were plotted and values which fell into the linear range of the curve were selected to calculate endpoint titres. RNA sequencing [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap52473?item=s4-11) Samples for RNA sequencing were obtained from 16 mice in one FACS sort. cDNA was prepared from sorted cells using the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Clontech # 634890) on the day of the sort following the manufacturer's protocol. 400 pg of cDNA per sample were used as input for the preparation of sequencing libraries with the Illumina Nextera XT kit (#FC-131-1096) following the manufacturer's instructions. The quality of the cDNA and libraries was assessed using Agilent Bioanalyser High Sensitivity DNA Chips (#5067-4626), and Qubit a Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Invitrogen). Six samples from young mice and six samples from aged mice passed all quality controls, were pooled onto two HiSeq sequencing lanes and sequenced as 100 bp single-end reads. RNA sequencing analysis was performed using the SeqMonk software package (Babraham Institute, [https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/)) after trimming (Trim Galore v0.4.2) and alignment of reads to the reference mouse genome GRCm38 using HISAT2 ( [Kim et al., 2015](#bib47)). Reads were quantitated over exons and library size was standardized to 1 million reads, and then read counts were log2 transformed. Differentially expressed genes were determined by DESeq2 analysis using raw counts (adjusted p-value cut-off p0.05) ( [Love et al., 2014](#bib59)). Principal component analysis was performed using 1000 genes with the largest variances, after normalisation for batch effects with RUVSeq ( [Risso et al., 2014](#bib77)). To test for the differential expression of functionally related gene sets, a publicly available list of gene sets (Mouse_GO_AllPathways_with_GO_iea_December_24_2014_symbol.gmt.txt of Bader Lab EM_Genesets [Merico et al., 2010](#bib64)) was filtered for categories containing less than 20 or more than 500 genes. Resulting gene sets were tested for differential expression between young and aged samples using Seqmonk Subgroup Statistics (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p<0.05, average absolute z-score >1, multiple testing correction). from GSE45735 were used to assess an individual's IFN response over time ( [Henn et al., 2013](#bib40)). Corresponding fastq files were obtained from SRA using the sratoolkit ( [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/)) and aligned to GRCh38 using HISAT2 ( [Kim et al., 2015](#bib47)). Counting, at gene level, et 2002](#bib44); [Love et al., 2014](#bib59)) was applied to the counts to give an expression value per gene. To analyse the IFN-I response in these datasets we used the 'HALLMARKS' IFN alpha response, which is a gene set curated by MSigDB at the Broad Institute based on experimentally derived expression data ( [Subramanian et al., 2005](#bib89); [Liberzon et al., 2015](#bib56)), and which we have used previously to identify and validate a role for IFN-I in the formation of ectopic lymphoid structures al., 2015](#bib68)) were re-analysed as follows: Raw. CEL files were downloaded from GEO with the corresponding annotation data. CEL files were read into R via readAffy ( [Gautier et al., 2004](#bib29)) [Huber et al., 2002](#bib44)). The dataset was then subsetted to select only individuals with paired day 0 and day 1 samples. Genes were selected as described in the results section. Antibody titres were made available upon request ( [Nakaya et al., 2015](#bib68)). Statistics All mouse experiments were performed twice or more with 3-10 mice per group. Differences between experimental groups were assessed using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis test combined with Dunn's multiple testing within the Prism v6 and v7 software (GraphPad). Outliers as determined by Tukey's outlier test within the Prism software were excluded from the analysis. Test Rank correlations were determined using Spearman's correlation coefficients (rho). p-values0.05 were considered statistically significant. For RNA sequencing analysis, sequencing reads were quantitated over exons and library size was standardized to 1 million reads, and then read counts were log2 transformed. Differentially expressed genes were determined by DESeq2 analysis using raw counts (adjusted p-value cut-off p0.05). Data availability Source data files are included with this manuscript.

Summary: A number of studies have demonstrated that vaccine responses are impaired in older patient populations leaving them vulnerable to infections such as influenza. As a result, it is a topic of current interest to discover the details of how this occurs in order to find strategies to improve vaccine response in aged cohorts. In this study, Stebegg et al., demonstrate that Tfh responses are reduced in both aged humans and mice and suggest that impaired type-I interferon signaling in cDC2 results in reduced CD80 and CD86, which in turn affects Tfh formation and antibody responses. Overall, the paper is well written and covers a topic of significant interest. However, there are a few issues that need to be cleaned up. Essential revisions: 1) Impaired DC activation/Tfh generation in ageing, and the importance of type-I IFN signaling in DCs for Tfh generation, have been previously published. In this regard, the current study mechanistically links previous observation to explain the defective Tfh generation in ageing by finding the reduced type-I IFN signaling in DCs in aged mice. Given that DCs from aged mice were able to respond normally to exogenous IFNa, the reduced amount of IFNa/b produced in aged mice after immunization or infection could explain the defective Tfh generation. What type of cells produce IFNa/b in response to immunization for proper cDC2 activation? The IFNb producing cells should be identified in Figure 5F. 2) Figure 8: The authors use Imiquimod to induce IFN signaling and restore cDC2 function in aged mice. While these data are of interest Imiquimod is not a specific inducer of interferon signaling and also acts via a range of other pathways to induce other Tfh relevant factors such as IL-6. (Br J Dermatol. action. Sch\u00f6n MP1, Sch\u00f6n M.). This is brought into particular focus by the title of the paper. The CD11c conditional IFNR mouse used in Figure 7 should be used to confirm if the effect of imiquimod is dependent on IFN signaling in this context. 1) In Figure 3G, # of GFP+cDC2 in draining LNs was reduced after immunization of aged mice with Ea-GFP. Does this mean that ability of cDC2s in aged mice to endocytose antigens is defective or that total number of cDC2 in draining LNs of aged mice is decreased? 2) Antigen-specific antibody response (High affinity vs low affinity in case of NP immunization) should be shown in Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 7, Figure 8. 3) Does Imiquimod also have a Tfh enhancing effect in young mice? Some caution has to be used when an agent that enhances responses in all populations is interpreted as specifically restoring a sub-population specific defect. 4) In Figure 3 the authors note that the aged cDC2 have reduced MHCII, CD80, CD86 and CD40. In Figure 4 they attempt to unpick this by using CTLA-4Ig in Figure 4 which reduces T-cell proliferation. Does it also reduce the% Tfh? However, while it is possible to use CTLA-4Ig to demonstrate the broad point that blocking CD80 and CD86 impacts T-cell proliferation and Tfh formation it not clear how this provides any evidence that loss of CD80 and CD86 on cDC2 is the specific cause of low of Tfh in aged mice. These data could be moved to the supplemental material. It is reasonable to speculate that the changes to CD86 and CD80 seen in Figure 3 may have a role, and it has previously been demonstrated that even modest changes to CD28 signaling may be enough to alter Tfh formation (Wang, 2015), but the authors should be aware that they have not proved this experimentally. 5) Figure 7: E and G. Representative data are shown from only one group and so does not allow any comparison. Please include examples from both groups.

[...]. Overall, the paper is well written and covers a topic of significant interest. However, there are a few issues that need to be cleaned up. We appreciate this supportive review and have revised the manuscript according to the suggestions. The details of how the comments have been addressed are included below under each point. Alterations are underlined in the text of the manuscript, and all relevant text and figures are included in the response to reviewers under each point. Essential revisions: 1) Impaired DC activation/Tfh generation in ageing, and the importance of type-I IFN signaling in DCs for Tfh generation, have been previously published. In this regard, the current study mechanistically links previous observation to explain the defective Tfh generation in ageing by finding the reduced type-I IFN signaling in DCs in aged mice. Given that DCs from aged mice were able to respond normally to exogenous IFNa, the reduced amount of IFNa/b produced in aged mice after immunization or infection could explain the defective Tfh generation. What type of cells produce IFNa/b in response to immunization for proper cDC2 activation? The IFNb producing cells should be identified in Figure 5F. To identify the cellular source of Ifnb1 production after immunisation we sorted T cells, B cells, macrophages, plasmacytoid DCs (pDC), cDC1 and cDC2/Langerhans cells from node of either unimmunised or immunised mice. RT-qPCR shows that pDCs and CD64+F4/80+ macrophages produced the highest levels of Ifnb1 after immunisation. This potentially implicates changes in the number or function of these cells in ageing that leads to a reduced IFN-I response in cDC2s. Interestingly, there is an age-associated decrease in pDC numbers which may contribute to the phenotype observed in aged mice. In bone marrow (BM) chimeras where aged mice were irradiated and reconstituted with BM from younger adult mice, the reduction in pDC numbers persists in the aged host, indicating a cell-extrinsic cause of reduced pDCs in aged mice. In these chimeras, the number of GFP+ cDC2 is diminished, as was their expression of CD80/86, suggesting that the aged microenvironment, and potentially the reduction of IFN-I-producing pDC contributes to impaired dendritic cell activation in ageing. All these data have been included in Figure 4. We have also included a section in the Material and Methods section to describe how the cell sort was performed. To further exclude any contribution of cell-intrinsic factors to the reduced IFN-I response of cDC2s in aged mice, we compared the expression of Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) in cDC2s from adult and aged mice upon ex vivo treatment with low levels of IFN. These data are included in Figure 4 and revealed that the upregulation of the ISGs Ifit1 and Mx1 in cDC2s are intact in aged mice, consistent with the pSTAT1 data provided in the original version of the paper. This supports the interpretation of the data that aged cDC2s are capable of responding to IFN-I and do not exhibit cell-intrinsic defects in IFN signalling. These new results have been incorporated into the manuscript as follows: Subsection \"The cDC2 response to IFN-I is phosphorylation levels and upregulation of the ISGs Ifit1 and Mx1 in cDC2s were intact in aged mice upon ex vivo treatment with low levels of IFN (Figure 4G-J). [...] Together, this suggests that the poor activation of cDC2s in the LNs of aged animals could be driven by reduced numbers of IFN-I-producing pDCs due to age-related changes in their microenvironment.\" Discussion section: \"Ageing has been reported to impair DC activation (Agrawal et al., 2007; Moretto, Lawlor and Khan, 2008), the production of IFN-I cytokines by pDCs in both humans and mice (Stout-Delgado et al., 2008b; Panda et 2017), and the formation of Tfh cells (Garcia and Miller, 2001b; Eaton et al., 2004; Nikolich-ugich, 2018). In addition, Brahmakshatriya and colleagues have demonstrated that transferring activated, in vitro BM-derived DCs into aged mice can boost both the GC and Tfh cell response upon immunisation (Brahmakshatriya et al., 2017). Our study demonstrates that age-associated defects in the early induction of IFN-I expression, probably by pDCs and macrophages, results in impaired expression of co-stimulatory molecules on cDC2s.\" Figure 4 legend: \"(I-J) Ifit1 (I) and Mx1 sorted GFP+ CD11b+ cDC2s by RT-qPCR upon ex vivo treatment of LN cells with 50 U murine IFN for 3 hours.

[...] RNA for RT-qPCR was isolated from cell pellets using Qiagen's RNeasy Mini or Micro Kit (#74104 and #74004).\" 2) Figure 8: The authors use Imiquimod to induce IFN signaling and restore cDC2 function in aged mice. While these data are of interest Imiquimod is not a specific inducer of interferon signaling and also acts via a range of other pathways to induce other Tfh relevant factors such as IL-6. (Br J Dermatol. action. Sch\u00f6n MP1, Sch\u00f6n M.). This is brought into particular focus by the title of the paper. The CD11c conditional IFNR mouse used in Figure 7 should be used to confirm if the effect of imiquimod is dependent on IFN signaling in this context. We agree with the reviewers that imiquimod may also act via IFN-I-independent mechanisms to promote cDC2 and Tfh cells in aged mice and that this is important for the interpretation of the data presented in this paper. We have done two sets of experiments to address this key point. 1) Ifnar1-/- miceand controls were treated with imiquimod to determine whether effects of imiquimod on DC numbers and activation early after immunisation are also mediated by IFN-I signalling. These data show that the effect of imiquimod on cDC2 numbers and CD80/86 expression are largely IFN-I driven. These data are now included in Figure 7H-J, and discussed in subsection of Ifnar1-/- and Ifnar1+/+ mice revealed that the enhancing effects of imiquimod on cDC2 numbers and activation were largely, but not completely, dependent on IFN-I signalling (Figure7H-J). This demonstrates that imiquimod treatment can boost the reduced IFN-I response, and revert the numerical and co-stimulatory defects observed in cDC2s from aged mice.\" Figure 7 legend: \"(H-J) 2 month Ifnar1-/- and Ifnar1+/+ mice were immunised subcutaneously with E-GFP in IFA and some of the mice were additionally treated with imiquimod cream over their immunisation sites.

(I-J) Quantitation of median fluorescence intensity (MFI) levels of CD86 (I) and CD80 (J) on the surface of these GFP+ CD11b+ cDC2s. Bar graphs show the results of one of two independent experiments (B-G; n=6 per group/experiment) or the pooled results from two experiments (H-J; n=3-11 per group). Bar height corresponds to the median, and each circle represents one biological replicate. In (B-G) p-values were determined using the Mann-Whitney test. In (H-J) p-values were determined by comparing each group to the \"Ifnar1+/+ no imiquimod control\" group using the Kruskal Wallis test with Dunn's multiple testing correction. Supporting data are shown in Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1. 2) To investigate whether the effect of imiquimod on Tfh cell formation is IFN-I-independent, we conducted the experiment suggested by the reviewer and treated 2 month old Ifnar1fl/flItgaxcre/+or Ifnar1fl/flItgax+/+ control mice with imiquimod upon immunisation and analysed Tfh cell formation seven days later. These data show that imiquimod is able to boost Tfh cells to the same extent in Ifnar1fl/flItgaxcre/+mice as in control animals. These data demonstrate that there are IFN-independent effects of imiquimod that are able to boost Tfh cells in younger mice, these data are now included as Figure 8G-H and discussed on page 14. Because of these results we have revised the manuscript to ensure that all conclusions and interpretations are consistent with these new data, this includes revising the Title, Abstract and Discussion section of the paper. Title: Rejuvenating conventional dendritic cells and T follicular helper cell formation after vaccination Abstract: [...] Here, we demonstrate that older people and aged mice have impaired Tfh cell differentiation upon vaccination. This deficit is preceded by poor activation of conventional dendritic cells type 2 (cDC2) due to reduced type 1 interferon signalling. Importantly, the Tfh and cDC2 cell response can be boosted in aged mice by treatment with a TLR7 agonist. This demonstrates that age-associated defects in the cDC2 and Tfh cell response are not irreversible and can be enhanced to improve vaccine responses in older individuals. Subsection \"The Tfh cell numbers in both 2-3- and 22-24-month-old mice seven days after immunisation (Figure 8A-F). [...] Imiquimod treatment did not affect serum levels of antigen-specific antibodies at this early time-point when most antibodies come from the extrafollicular plasmablast response (Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A-C) (MacLennan Figure all Alum and then either topically over were determined using the Mann-Whitney test. Supporting data are shown in Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1.\" Discussion section: \"In an attempt to enhance cDC2 and Tfh cell responses upon vaccination, we applied a cream containing the TLR7-agonist imiquimod, which has been shown to induce IFN-Is (Chen et al., 1988; Bottrel et al., 1999; Sauder, 2003) to the skin of mice upon immunisation. [...] Together, this indicates that the TLR7 agonist imiquimod can boost cDC2 and Tfh cells using more than one mechanism, reinforcing its potential as a vaccine adjuvant.\" 1) In Figure 3G, # of GFP+cDC2 in draining LNs was reduced after immunization of aged mice with Ea-GFP. Does this mean that ability of cDC2s in aged mice to endocytose antigens is defective or that total number of cDC2 in draining LNs of aged mice is decreased? In our experiments we see a reduced number of total cDC2 draining to the LN, which was enhanced by application of imiquimod. To clarify this point, we have now included graphs showing the number of total, as well as GFP+ CD11b+ cDC2s in Figures 3G and 7D, which are mentioned Subsection \"T cell priming in aged mice\": \"One day after immunisation, aged mice had half the number of total and GFP+ CD11b+ cDC2s compared to younger controls (Figure 3G-H).\" 2-3-month-old mice cells after immunisation (n=7-10 per group/experiment).

P-values were determined using the Mann-Whitney test.\" 2) Antigen-specific antibody response (High affinity vs low affinity in case of NP immunization) should be shown in Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 7, Figure 8. These data have now been included in Figure 2E-G, Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A-C, Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A-C and Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A-C. It is important to note, however, that the early time points of our experiments (7-10 days after immunisation) will be largely measuring antibody produced from the extrafollicular plasmablast response rather than from the germinal centre reaction. Subsection \"Tfh cell and GC responses are impaired in ageing\": \"However the number of GC B cells was ten-fold lower in the aged mice ten days after immunisation, compared to younger adult mice (Figure 2C).

[...] Absorbance values from serially diluted samples were plotted and values which fell into the linear range of the curve were selected to calculate endpoint titres.\" 3) Does Imiquimod also have a Tfh enhancing effect in young mice? Some caution has to be used when an agent that enhances responses in all populations is interpreted as specifically restoring a sub-population specific defect. We have included data from young mice treated with imiquimod at the time of immunisation in Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A-F and Figure 8C, boosts cDC2s and Tfh cell to reflect these changes. These data show that imiquimod enhances Tfh cell differentiation irrespective of age, but only enhanced GC B cell numbers in aged mice. \"Imiquimod treatment increased expression of the ISGs Ifit1 and Mx1 in antigen-bearing cDC2s 22-24-month-old mice compared to age-matched no-imiquimod controls one day after immunisation (Figure 7B-C; Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A-B). This was associated with a two- to three-fold increase in the number of total and GFP+ CD11b+ cDC2s in draining LNs (Figure 7D-E; Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C-D) and with a two-fold increase in CD80 and CD86 on their surfaces (Figure Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1E-F). In addition, imiquimod potently total 1W1K-specific Tfh cell numbers in both 2-3- and 22-24-month-old mice seven days after immunisation (Figure 8A-F). 7\u2014figure 1 legend: \"Figure induces responses. 2-3-month-old mice were immunised subcutaneously with either E-GFP in IFA. [...] Bar height corresponds to the median, and each circle represents one biological replicate. P-values were determined using the Alum and then either topically over andIfnar1fl/flItgax+/+ mice)or left untreated (\"Untreated\"). data are shown in Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1.\" 4) In Figure 3 the authors note that the aged cDC2 have reduced MHCII, CD80, CD86 and CD40. In Figure 4 they attempt to unpick this by using CTLA-4Ig in Figure 4 which reduces T-cell proliferation. Does it also reduce the% Tfh? However, while it is possible to use CTLA-4Ig to demonstrate the broad point that blocking CD80 and CD86 impacts T-cell proliferation and Tfh formation it not clear how this provides any evidence that loss of CD80 and CD86 on cDC2 is the specific cause of low of Tfh in aged mice. These data could be moved to the supplemental material. It is reasonable to speculate that the changes to CD86 and CD80 seen in Figure 3 may have a role, and it has previously been demonstrated that even modest changes to CD28 signaling may be enough to alter Tfh formation (Wang, 2015), but the authors should be aware that they have not proved this experimentally. As suggested, we have moved Figure 4 to Supplementary Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1H-L and changed subsection \"The cDC2 response to IFN-I is reduced in aged mice\" to clarify our interpretation of the data, particularly with respect to Wang, 2015. \"By partially blocking these co-stimulatory ligands using a CTLA4-Ig fusion protein in vivo, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in early T cell proliferation (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1K-L). Moreover, Wang et al. had previously demonstrated that reducing the magnitude of CD28 signalling in vivo impairs Tfh cell differentiation (C. J. Wang et al., 2015). This implicates the age-associated reduction in the expression of CD80/CD86 on cDC2s as a likely factor that contributes to impaired T cell priming and Tfh cell formation in aged mice.\" 5) Figure 7: E and G. Representative data are shown from only one group and so does not allow any comparison. Please include examples from both groups. We have now included examples from both groups in this figure (now Figure 6E and G).

Assessment of inflammatory and metabolic characteristics of a urbanizing African population and the comparison with populations outside Africa could provide insight in the pathophysiology of the rapidly increasing epidemic of NCDs, including the role of environmental and dietary changes. Using a proteomic plasma profiling approach comprising 92 inflammation-related molecules, we examined differences in the inflammatory proteome in healthy Tanzanian and healthy Dutch adults. We show that healthy Tanzanians display a pro-inflammatory phenotype compared to Dutch subjects, with enhanced activity of the Wnt/-catenin signalling pathway and higher concentrations of different metabolic regulators such as 4E-BP1 and fibroblast growth factor 21. Among the Tanzanian volunteers, food-derived metabolites were identified as an important driver of variation in inflammation-related molecules, emphasizing the potential importance of lifestyle changes. These findings endorse the importance of the current dietary transition and the inclusion of underrepresented populations in systems immunology studies. - - Genetics and Genomics - Immunology and Inflammation CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (CD8+ Trm) cells play key roles in many immune-inflammation-related diseases. However, their characteristics in the pathological process of oral lichen planus (OLP) remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the function of CD8+ Trm cells in the process of OLP. By using single-cell RNA sequencing profiling and spatial transcriptomics, we revealed that CD8+ Trm cells were predominantly located in the lamina propria adjacent to the basement membrane and were significantly increased in patients with erosive oral lichen planus (EOLP) compared to those with non-erosive oral lichen planus (NEOLP). Furthermore, these cells displayed enhanced production, including IFN- (Interferon-gamma, a pro-inflammatory signaling molecule), TNF- Necrosis cytokine regulating inflammation), and IL-17 (Interleukin-17, a cytokine involved in immune response modulation), in patients with EOLP. And our clinical cohort of 1-year follow-up was also supported the above results in RNA level and protein level. In conclusion, our study provided a novel molecular mechanism for triggering OLP erosion by CD8+ Trm cells to secrete multiple cytokines, and new insight "}
