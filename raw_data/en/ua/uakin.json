When the mirror is allowed to vibrate by coupling it to a mechanical (spring-like) system, energy can be transferred between coupled optomechanical resonators. Depending on the detuning of the cavity, one can obtain either damping (cooling) or amplification (heating) of the mirror motion. Notable achievements in this field are the demonstration of mirror cooling (damping of the internal degree of motion) to sub-Kelvin (6 mK) temperatures and demonstration of radiation driven high-Q, high-frequency (1 GHz) oscillators.

It is anticipated this will result in a new generation of mass-sensing devices and ultra high-Q, high-frequency resonators controlled by light.

Quantum sensors retain the generally better propagation characteristics of long wavelength light while achieving the better spatial resolution of short wavelength radiation. Conventional classical sensors rely on light with shorter wavelengths, like blue light, to produce sharp images. As wavelengths increase, for example from blue to infrared, the classical resolution decreases. Quantum sensors will be able to retain high resolution as the wavelength increases using a non-classical effect called entanglement. Two broad classes of sensor are under consideration. Type I quantum sensors propagate entangled photons to a target and back to a detector, where quantum effects may enhance resolution. Type II quantum sensors propagate classical radiation to the target, and entangled photons are used within the detector to improve resolution. A third class of approach, based on ghost imaging, is also being explored.

These technologies will lead to new multi-generation product lines of commercially viable, sustainable computing systems for a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering applications; it will include both supercomputer and embedded computing systems. One of the major challenges currently facing the DoD is the prohibitively high cost, time, and expertise required to build large complex software systems. Powerful new approaches and tools are needed to enable the rapid and efficient production of new software, including software that can be easily changed to address new requirements and can adjust dynamically to platform and environmental perturbations. The project will ensure accessibility and usability to a wide range of application developers, not just computational science experts. This project is essential for maintaining the nation's strength in both supercomputer computation for ultra large-scale engineering applications for surveillance and reconnaissance data assimilation and exploitation, and for environmental modeling and prediction. (U) Even as this project develops the next generation of high-productivity, high-performance computing systems, it is looking further into the future to develop the technological and architectural solutions that are required to develop \"extreme computing\" systems. The military will demand increasing diversity, quantities, and complexity of sensor and other types of data, both on the battlefield and in command centers - processed in time to effectively impact warfighting decisions. Computing assets must progress dramatically to meet significantly increasing performance and significantly decreasing power and size requirements. Extreme computing systems will scale to deliver a thousand times the capabilities of future petascale systems using the same power and size or will scale to deliver terascale-embedded systems at one millionth of the size and power of petascale systems. The resulting extreme computing systems will be capable of scaling from embedded to leadership class supercomputer systems. The most significant technical achievements that must be realized to obtain the goals of extreme computing are the enabling architectural advancements, pervasive low power approaches, low volume physical packaging, and effective programming of these systems. Numerous additional technical challenges must be resolved, including the reliability of \"extreme computing\" systems: embedded systems require a higher level of reliability and assurance than general-purpose systems because the failure of an embedded computing system can result in the loss of a deployed platform. 46UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #11 Page 5 of 33Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NUMBER B. in 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 High-Productivity Computing Systems (HPCS) (U) The ongoing High-Productivity Computing Systems (HPCS) program will enable nuclear stockpile stewardship, weapons design, crypto-analysis, weather prediction, and other large-scale problems that cannot be addressed productively with today's computers.

Within the context of DoD systems, mechanisms for self-modification and self-optimization will enable extreme computing systems to recognize and adapt in real-time to changing requirements, faults, malicious attacks, and opportunities to improve performance through learning. This program will develop self-aware trusted computing techniques that will provide autonomous system monitoring. (U) The Extreme Computing program addresses several problem areas for embedded and supercomputer systems: power, programming and resiliency. Available hardware is increasingly power hungry, difficult to program, and less resilient to faults/errors. The Extreme Computing program is developing new structured architectures, tools, techniques, and an integrated design flow to enable DoD application developers to efficiently and effectively develop high-performance, mission enabling, affordable, application-specific processors. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and multi-core processors will receive particular emphasis with respect to programming issues. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Identified and assessed the potential technologies necessary to provide the types of improvements essential to achieve extreme computing: non-von solutions; new memory and storage architectures; and non-intrusive interfaces. - Initiated a study to identify potential new hardware architectures and candidate approaches, such as master/slave methods where the \"slave\" collects and condenses data.

Previous programs included the Dynamic Quarantine of Computer-Based Worms (DQW) and Defense Against Cyber Attacks on Mobile Ad-hoc Network Systems (DCAMANET). (U) IAMANET will build upon the successes achieved in both the DQW and the DCMANET programs. IAMANET will directly support integrity, availability, reliability, confidentiality, and safety of Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) communications and data. In contrast, the dominant Internet paradigm is intrinsically insecure. For example, the Internet does not deny unauthorized traffic by default and therefore violates the principle of least privilege. In addition, there are no provisions for non-repudiation or accountability and therefore adversaries can probe for vulnerabilities with impunity because the likelihood of attributing bad behavior to an adversary is limited. Current protocols are not robust to purposely induced failures and malicious behavior, leaving entire Internet-based systems vulnerable in the case of defensive failure. IAMANET, on the other hand, uses a deny-by-default networking paradigm, allowing only identifiable authorized users to communicate on the network. While the objective transition path for IAMANET technologies is to the Services to support mobile tactical operations, the IAMANET systems will be interoperable with fixed networks and may also have potential applicability to the broader DoD network architecture. FY 2008 Accomplishments: Intrinsically Assured Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (IAMANET) - Developed preliminary designs for an assurable network infrastructure (architecture, control and management, algorithms and policies). - Established an independent IAMANET red team to critique the performers during the design of the assurable network infrastructure.

Dynamic Quarantine of Computer-Based Worms (DQW) - Harden system against directed attacks. - Improve detection and response capabilities discovered from testing. - Test integrated system on operational network. - Test integrated system against red teams (attack teams) during Combatant Command exercise. - Transition technology to DoD. FY 2010 Plans: Intrinsically Assured Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (IAMANET) - Conduct red team attacks and assessments of the assurable network infrastructure to verify the network's integrity, availability, reliability, confidentiality, and safety. - Initiate the design, development and integration of a secondary defensive subsystem (similar to what was developed under DCAMANET and the Dynamic Quarantine of Worms) with the assurable network infrastructure and a host radio. - Initiate design and development of trusted hardware components for specific key functions. Trustworthy Systems (U) The goal of the Trustworthy Systems program is to provide foundational trustworthy computer platforms for Defense Department computing systems. This program seeks to develop technologies such as novel computer processing architectures, hardware, firmware, or microkernels to guarantee network and workstation security and will initially focus on network-based monitoring approaches that provide maximum coverage of the network with performance independent of the network size.

Operational goals of the network-monitoring component include: 1) improved probability of detection/probability of false alarm performance and 2) scalability to future gateway line speeds. The desired result is to allow software to be imperfect while mitigating catastrophic failures. Technical challenges include remotely monitoring mission- critical servers using virtual machines, tracking the trustworthiness of the server, and controlling the server to return it to trustworthiness states. Primary end users identified to date include Strategic Command Joint Task Force/Global Network Operations and Headquarters Pacific Command. Transition partners include National Computer Security Center, Naval Information Warfare Activity, and Defense Information Systems Agency. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Developed scalable formal methods to verify complex hardware/software. - Researched network-sensitive approaches to monitor, and trustworthy controllers to control, how and when information is disseminated across the network based on network performance, load, criticality, and target capacity. FY 2009 Plans: - Investigate the use of new virtual machine hardware architectures to develop a feedback loop that enables the host to monitor and control its behavior in the presence of untrustworthy software. - Investigate secure hardware designs, software architectures, and code assessment technologies. FY 2010 Plans: - Complete evaluation of client-side controller software in laboratory environment. - Develop client-side laboratory-scale software and server-side virtual-machine based automated recovery. - Harden and evaluate client-side controller code for field-deployable operations.

This program will develop security aware systems that will avoid brittleness and vulnerability, due to their ability to reason about their own security attributes, capabilities and functions with respect to specific mission needs. These systems will also dynamically adapt to provide desired levels of service while minimizing risk and providing coherent explanations of the relative safety of service level alternatives. These systems will bolster the reliability and security of critical open source software systems by reducing vulnerabilities and logic errors, and providing state-of-the-art software analysis techniques augmented with cognitive decision-making techniques with the ultimate goal of applying these systems on to the Global Information Grid. Research efforts will also explore provable protection of information within systems that exhibit imperfect security. A new kind of computational framework is needed that enables critical information and program separation properties (e.g., information in one graphical user interface (GUI) window never leaks to another GUI window). (U) The Application Communities (AC) effort will develop technologies to protect DoD information systems that employ commercial software applications against cyber attack and system failure by developing collaboration-based defenses that detect, respond to, and heal with little or no human assistance. The effort will leverage advances in information assurance research programs to create a new generation of self-defending software that automatically responds to threats, and provides a comprehensive picture of security properties, displayed at multiple levels of abstraction and formality. This capability will bring intelligent security adaptation to DoD systems and make security properties and status more apparent to decision makers. AC technology will enable collections of similar systems to collaboratively generate a shared awareness of security vulnerabilities, vulnerability mitigation strategies, and early warnings of attack. AC will revolutionize the security of military information systems and reduce the threat from stealthy intrusion of critical systems and/or denial of service attacks. (U) The Self-Regenerative Systems (SRS) effort will design, develop, demonstrate and validate architectures, tools, and techniques for fielding systems capable of adapting to novel threats, unanticipated workloads and evolving system configurations. SRS technology will employ innovative techniques like biologically-inspired diversity, cognitive immunity and healing, granular and scalable redundancy, and 58UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #11 Page 17 of 33Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NUMBER B. in FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 higher-level functions such as reasoning, reflection and learning. SRS technologies will make critical future information systems more robust, survivable and trustworthy. SRS will also develop technologies to mitigate the insider threat. SRS-enabled systems will be able to reconstitute their full functional and performance capabilities after experiencing accidental component failure, software error, or even an intentional cyber-attack. These systems will also show a positive trend in reliability, actually exceeding initial operation capability and approaching a theoretical optimal performance level over long periods while maintaining robustness and trustworthiness attributes. (U) The Scalable Cryptographic Key Management effort seeks to develop a key management and key distribution system with an overall overhead equal to or less than today's key management systems, while servicing thousands--or tens of thousands--of devices. The lack of a scalable key management and distribution system is the fundamental hurdle to the widespread deployment of secure radios and encryption devices to individual desktops. This effort will leverage changes in underlying technology and reduced costs for these new technologies to produce applications that will transition to the Services or via the commercial sector ranging from secure hand-held radios for tactical use to desktop level encryption devices for more secure networks. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Developed techniques to collaboratively diagnose and respond to problems (e.g., attacks or failures that threaten a mission) in groups of military systems. - Developed techniques to summarize security policy and status so the descriptions produced by the AC program can be understood without omitting critical details. - Developed static and dynamic source code analysis techniques (e.g., data and control-flow-based techniques, model-checking, strong typing) to relate software module structures and runtime state with the representation of security properties/configurations. - Demonstrated self-explanation techniques in which systems explain their critical security properties and status in a manner that is understandable to a variety of managing software components and human operators. 59UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #11 Page 18 of 33Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NUMBER B. in Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 - Developed additional general strategies to automatically immunize systems against new attacks and preempt insider attacks; enabling anomaly detection, combining and correlating information from system layers, and using direct user challenges. FY 2009 Plans: - Develop, test and validate regimes to assess the protection mechanisms of security products, and certify protection to quantifiable levels based on a scientific rationale. - Develop measures to quantitatively characterize various dimensions of security (availability, integrity, confidentiality, authentication, and non-repudiation), fault tolerance, and intrusion tolerance, and demonstrate the theory's relevance by applying it to a realistic exemplar system. - Tailor an exemplar self-regenerative system representative of a military application, thereby demonstrating the protective value to the warfighter. - Conceptualize a new computer workstation architecture that enables both formal proof and exhaustive validation of critical information and program separation properties. FY 2010 Plans: - Demonstrate a prototype exemplar self-regenerative system representative of a military application. - Mature, evaluate and transition technologies enabling development of an enterprise network that rapidly identifies, localizes and suppresses attacks and accidental faults automatically, and provides an early warning system that predicts these events. - Develop the architecture to enable a reliable key management system that will issue, revoke, and change the key for 10,000+ users. - Initiate fabrication of affordable key management system components. Control Plane (U) The Control Plane program improved end-to-end network performance between the Continental United States (CONUS) operating base and forward deployed tactical units.

Control-Based Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (CBMANET) (U) The Control-Based Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (CBMANET) program is developing an adaptive networking capability that dramatically improves performance and reduces life-threatening communication failures in complex communication networks. In order to develop this new capability, the initial focus is on tactical mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) that are inadequately supported with commercial technology. Conventional MANETs are composed of interdependent nodes based on interdependent system layers. Each MANET node exposes tens to hundreds of configurable parameters that must be continuously adapted due to variable tactical factors such as mission profile, phase, force structure, enemy activity, and environmental conditions. The complexity of this high-dimensional, adaptive, constrained, distributed network configuration problem is overwhelming to human operators and designers and has root causes in the historically wire-line-oriented networking paradigms. This program will take on the ambitious goal of researching a novel protocol stack that supports integrated optimization and control of all network layers simultaneously. Key technical challenges include scalable design, stability, and convergence. These challenges are particularly difficult in a distributed setting with partial and uncertain information, high communications overhead, and high probability of link failure.

Code Characterization* *Formerly Defense Autonomous Systems. (U) The Code Characterization program will develop cyber forensic techniques to characterize, analyze and identify malicious code. Today malicious computer code is found through its effects and isolation after infection. Current detection, analysis, and corrective software requires an intensive, manual process that is always conducted afterwards. This program will develop breakthrough abilities in visualization, threat identification analysis and threat mitigation analysis to enable positive identification of malcode sub-structures. By using cross-utilization and cross-domain analysis using these baseline malcode sub- structures, this program will allow for the automatic discovery, identification, and characterization of any future variants of previously unknown malicious code in computing systems..000 3.750 8.500 62UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #11 Page 21 of 33Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NUMBER B. in 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2009 Plans: - Investigate innovative methods of integrating detection techniques to quickly identify malicious code delivered through various file types. - Develop automatic techniques to rapidly and interactively reconstruct (encrypted and non-encrypted) meta data to assist in the analysis of malicious code, or non-white listed software archives. FY 2010 Plans: - Develop techniques and algorithms to enable the characterization of future malicious code variants based on analyzed malcode substructures. - Initiate integration of automatic discovery, identification, analysis, and prediction algorithms. - Establish red team to test the malicious code detection techniques. - Develop a model to determine characteristics/patterns of a user's interaction with machine hardware and software to collect signature data which can identify potential adversary users. Geo-Steganography (U) The Geo-Steganography program will develop techniques for embedding additional information in a wide variety of digital file types in a manner that does not disturb the normal use of the file. This technology will enable tactical end users to add private information to normal digital communication channels, permitting privacy in a multicast, multiuser environment (for example coalition operations). The advantage of steganography is the ability to selectively expose additional private information to only a subset of end recipients within the context of ongoing normal message traffic. This can be accomplished in a way that minimally disturbs the usual file traffic over the channel. FY 2010 Plans: - Develop effective and transparent CONOPS for the use of steganography in operational settings as the basis for technology development and deployment. - Determine the most effective steganography techniques for tactical field use, considering document types, bandwidth impact, and ease of use..000 .000 5.000 DARPA Future Information Assurance Initiatives 2.250 .000 .000 63UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #11 Page 22 of 33Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NUMBER B. in Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 (U) The DARPA Future Information Assurance Initiatives identified promising technologies to enable remote command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) warfighting. Included in this initiative was the development of secure, efficient network protocols to exploit tomorrows network-centric technologies such as networked weapons platforms, mobile ad-hoc networks, and end-to-end collaboration (vice client-server paradigm). FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Developed a family of distributed, autonomous security devices to deal with asymmetric traffic on wide area networks. - Developed a secure, efficient network routing protocol for tomorrow's weapon, logistic, and command and control requirements. - Developed a wireless protocol that securely provides location, authentication, and communications in a practical manner. - Investigated new approaches to network security that scale with increased data rates and address spaces of future networks. Content Distribution (U) This program seeks to provide information to commanders and soldiers before they need it by anticipating their needs. Current systems (e.g., file caches, peer-to-peer networks or Akamai-like systems) watch what users' request and react by either moving data or shifting users to other data stores. These techniques neither move the data beforehand nor work efficiently in bandwidth constrained military environments. The Content Distribution program will combine content retrieval with geographic location aware content \"pushing\" that predicts what information deployed commanders will need and moves that data from one content network (e.g., in CONUS) to a deployed content retrieval network. The technology developed will provide content to deployed soldiers who are not in command posts by integrating the new content distribution system with the Disruption Tolerant Network (DTN) technology. This will allow the Defense Department to exploit network knowledge and signaling to push information during low network usage periods and reduce overall network loading, providing pre-positioned information so that commanders have the information they need before they need it.

High-Speed Optical Correlator for Next Generation Networks (U) The High-Speed Optical Correlator for Next Generation Networks program will investigate key technical areas of a revolutionary, high-speed optical correlator for next generation networks. As the core network data rates of fiber telecommunications increase, existing electronic content processors are challenged in terms of complexity and power consumption. Through the use of a novel optical- based digital pattern matching architecture, and using standard telecommunications components, this program will develop a scalable system that, together with electronic processing, will monitor, secure and assist next generation, very high data rate telecommunication networks (>100 Gbit/s). Successful implementation of this technology will allow existing slower speed, electronic processors to be used for secondary and more complex data processing.

Given the increasing quantity of computing devices in military, government, and corporate environments coupled with expensive and uncertain energy resources, there is an urgent need to develop revolutionary technologies that greatly reduce energy use and cost in modern computing systems. The Millicomputing program will drastically reduce power consumption while maintaining high-grade computing performance by matching the computational platform to the user's needs; exploiting concurrency inherent in instruction sets, processes, and applications; and improving resource utilization across the computational platform. FY 2010 Plans: - Design and develop computational platform and system design architecture. - Develop millicomputing proof-of-principle testbed. - Initiate develop of prototype system..000 .000 4.000 Trusted, Uncompromised Semiconductor Technology (TrUST) (U) The TrUST program was funded in FY 2008 under PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01. The TrUST program will address in Integrated Circuits (ICs) the fundamental problem of determining whether a microchip manufactured through a process that is inherently \"untrusted\" (i.e., not under our control) can be \"trusted\" to perform operations only as specified by the design, and no more. The program will consist of a set of complementary technologies integrated together in order to develop a product that can be transitioned to the DoD. The follow on effort will seek to discover an understanding of the function of an integrated circuit (IC) which is specified, designed and fabricated by someone untrusted; as is the case when using offshore resources. An example of such an integrated circuit would be a commercial off-the- shelf (COTS) application specific IC (ASIC) or COTS field programmable gate array (FPGA). While the COTS ASIC case is important, the COTS FPGA case is dominant, pervasive, and critical.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) This project is developing powerful new technologies for processing foreign languages that will provide critical capabilities for a wide range of military and national security needs, both tactical and strategic. The technologies and systems developed in this project will enable our military to automatically translate and exploit large volumes of speech and text in multiple languages obtained through a variety of means. (U) Current U.S. military operations involve close contact with a wide range of cultures and peoples. The warfighter on the ground needs hand-held, speech-to-speech translation systems that enable communication with the local population during tactical missions. Thus, tactical applications imply the need for two-way (foreign- language-to-English and English-to-foreign-language) translation. (U) Because foreign-language news broadcasts, web-posted content, and captured foreign-language hard-copy documents can provide insights regarding local and regional events, attitudes and activities, language translation systems also contribute to the development of good strategic intelligence. Such applications require one-way (foreign-language-to-English) translation. Exploitation of the resulting translated content requires the capability to automatically collate, filter, synthesize, summarize, and present relevant information in timely and relevant forms. B. Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 Spoken Language Communication and Translation System for Tactical Use (TRANSTAC) (U) The Spoken Language Communication and Translation System for Tactical Use (TRANSTAC) program is developing technologies that enable robust, spontaneous, two-way tactical speech communications between our warfighters and native speakers. The program addresses the issues surrounding the rapid deployment of new languages, especially low-resource languages and dialects. TRANSTAC is building upon existing speech translation platforms to create a rapidly deployable language tool that will meet the military's language translation needs. TRANSTAC is currently focusing on key languages of the Middle East region.

FY 2009 Plans: - Update/enhance the experimental systems in the field. - Continue mission needs analysis and aggressive language data collection. - Develop two-way translation systems in other languages that will enable the user to not only translate words, but also communicate and carry on limited conversation. - Develop context management translation techniques. FY 2010 Plans: - Continue to develop context management translation techniques. - Demonstrate a hands-free, eyes-free two-way translator prototype. - Extend translation techniques to develop translation systems emphasizing other key languages (Dari and Pashto). Global Autonomous Language Exploitation (GALE) (U) The Global Autonomous Language Exploitation (GALE) program will develop and integrate technology to enable automated transcription and translation of foreign speech and text along with content summarization. GALE will provide, in an integrated product, automated transcription and translation of foreign speech and text along with content summarization. When applied to foreign language broadcast media and web-posted content, GALE systems will enhance open-source intelligence and local/regional situational awareness and eliminate the need for translation and subject matter experts.

Multilingual Automatic Document Classification, Analysis and Translation (MADCAT) (U) The Multilingual Automatic Document Classification, Analysis and Translation (MADCAT) program will develop and integrate technology to enable exploitation of captured, foreign language, hard-copy documents. This technology is crucial to the warfighter, as hard-copy documents including notebooks, letters, ledgers, annotated maps, newspapers, newsletters, leaflets, pictures of graffiti, and document images (e.g., PDF files, JPEG files, scanned TIFF images, etc.) resident on magnetic and optical media captured in the field may contain important, but perishable information. Unfortunately, due to limited human resources and the immature state of applicable technology, the Services lack the ability to exploit, in a timely fashion, ideographic and script documents that are either machine printed or handwritten in Arabic. The MADCAT program will address this need by producing devices that will convert such captured documents to readable English in the field. MADCAT will substantially improve the applicable technologies, in particular document analysis and optical character recognition/optical handwriting recognition (OCR/OHR). MADCAT will then tightly integrate these improved technologies with translation technology and create demonstration prototypes for field trials. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Improved methods for document segmentation (e.g., title, address box, columns, lists, embedded picture/diagram/caption, annotation, signature block, etc.). - Improved script (e.g., Roman vs. Cyrillic) and language (e.g., Farsi vs. Arabic) identification.8.131 12.414 16.222 72UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #11 Page 31 of 33Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NUMBER B. in Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 - Developed algorithms for document type identification (e.g., letter, ledger, annotated map, newspaper, etc.). - Developed means to discriminate and separate handwriting from printed regions and improved OCR/ OHR technologies. - Developed the means of interpreting different regions within a document, such as extracting information from an address field or the axes of a table.

Robust Automatic Translation of Speech (RATS) (U) The Robust Automatic Translation of Speech (RATS) program will address noisy and hostile conditions where speech is degraded by distortion, reverberation, and/or competing conversations. Research into the issue of robustness to enhance the capabilities of speech processing will enable soldiers to hear or read clear English versions of what is being said in their vicinity, despite a noisy or echoic environment. In extremely noisy conditions, the technology developed through RATS will be able to isolate and deliver pertinent information to the warfighter by detecting periods of speech activity and discarding silent portions. RATS technology will also be able to detect the language spoken, identify the speaker, and search for key words in dialogue. RATS technology will build upon advances in GALE translation technology. FY 2009 Plans: - Improve the robustness of automatic speech transcription and translation algorithms in adverse environments (noise, distortion, reverberation, and competing speech signals). - Evaluate the relative benefits (performance versus computational requirements) of noise suppression and speech exploitation based on a single microphone versus using multi-microphone arrays. - Assess the current state of the art in speech processing for noisy environments, including echo suppression, speech activity detection, language identification, speaker identification and keyword spotting, and develop improved methods where required.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) The Cognitive Computing Systems program element is budgeted in the Applied Research budget activity because it is developing the next revolution in computing and information processing technology that will enable computational systems to have reasoning and learning capabilities and levels of autonomy far beyond those of today's systems. The ability to reason, learn and adapt will raise computing to new levels of capability and powerful new applications. (U) Military command, control, communications, and intelligence/information systems must support warfighters in operations ranging from conflict and peacekeeping in urban centers to heavy battle actions in remote areas. Current capabilities do not provide the commander with real-time, secure, situational awareness nor with the capability to orchestrate high-tempo planning, rehearsal, and execution. The programs in this project are developing and testing innovative, secure architectures and tools to enhance information processing, dissemination, and presentation capabilities. The programs provide the commander insight into the disposition of enemy and friendly forces, a joint situational awareness picture that will improve planning, decision-making, and execution support capability, as well as secure multimedia information interfaces and software assurance to the warfighter \"on the move.\" Integration of collection management, planning, and battlefield awareness are essential elements for achieving battlefield dominance through assured information systems. (U) The Cognitive Computing project will develop core technologies that enable computing systems to learn, reason and apply knowledge gained through experience, and respond intelligently to things that have not been previously encountered. These technologies will lead to systems demonstrating increased self-reliance, self- adaptive reconfiguration, intelligent negotiation, cooperative behavior and survivability with reduced human intervention. 77UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #12 Page 2 of 26Exhibit R-2, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Budget Item Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602304E COGNITIVE COMPUTING SYSTEMS (U) The Collective Cognitive Systems and Interfaces Project will dramatically improve warfighter and commander effectiveness and productivity using advanced cognitive approaches that enable faster, better informed, and more highly coordinated actions than those of our enemies.

New foundational hardware architectures and software methods to facilitate learning and inference capabilities were created that are crucial to intelligent computing. These new computing foundations will help us move far beyond today's standard Von Neumann computing model.

Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 Self-Regenerative Systems (SRS) (U) The Self-Regenerative Systems (SRS) program designed, developed, demonstrated and validated architectures, tools, and techniques for fielding systems capable of adapting to novel threats, unanticipated workloads and evolving system configurations. The technology developed under this program employed innovative techniques including biologically-inspired diversity, cognitive immunity and healing, granular and scalable redundancy, and higher-level functions such as reasoning, reflection and learning. These technologies will make critical future information systems more robust, survivable and trustworthy. The SRS program also developed technologies to mitigate the insider threat.

These technologies will lead to systems with increased self reliance, cooperative behavior, and the capacity to reconfigure themselves and survive with reduced programmer intervention. These capabilities will make the difference between mission success and mission degradation or failure, even in the event of cyber-attack or component attrition resulting from kinetic warfare or accidental faults and errors. Systems that learn and reason will reduce the requirement for skilled system administrators and dramatically reduce the overall cost of system maintenance. As the military moves towards a dynamic expeditionary force, it is critical for systems to become more self sufficient. B. Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 Personalized Assistant that Learns (PAL) (U) The Personalized Assistant that Learns (PAL) program enables intelligence in information processing systems so that critical DoD systems can better support the warfighter. PAL systems will have embedded learning capabilities that will allow them to retain prior learned knowledge, apply this knowledge to new scenarios and ultimately provide faster and more effective assistance. Overall, the ability to learn will enable the performance of a PAL system to improve over time. Cognitive systems technologies developed in this program will be applied and demonstrated in the Increased Command and Control Effectiveness (ICE) program (PE 0603760E, Project CCC-01) prior to transition into Command Operations. (U) The PAL program is creating the first comprehensive system that will dramatically empower commanders to understand all aspects of the current military situation, radically reduce manpower and labor required in command posts and in the field, and automate the massive number of administrative and analytical tasks characteristic of today's command centers. PAL capabilities will result in the ability to turn diverse, multi-source data into actionable information for commanders and warfighters; dramatic manpower reductions; corporate memory retention of both the larger conflict history and the history of each specific command center; and intelligent information presentation.34.114 27.344 26.275 81UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #12 Page 6 of 26Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602304E COGNITIVE COMPUTING SYSTEMSPROJECT NUMBER Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 (U) PAL will create an intelligent desktop assistant that enables users to create and share routines to discover, manipulate, and exploit data, services and web content. This work will extend the emerging web services paradigm to produce semantically-enabled search and processing capabilities that make it easier to find information on the Internet and get it into the form a user needs. Ultimately this work will yield cognitive search agents that greatly reduce the time it takes users to find and process information. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Developed, demonstrated, and evaluated core physical awareness, cyber-awareness, multimodal dialogue, machine learning, and representation and reasoning technologies to support cognitive assistant executive functions. - Formulated an approach for receiving user guidance and translating it into the precise machine language necessary for both implementation and verification of user purpose and intent. - Demonstrated the utility of PAL technologies for the Army Knowledge Online's Company Command online community. - Optimized PAL technology to provide maximum benefit to operational users. - Demonstrated PAL technologies on data from a number of operational military systems and used the results of these demonstrations as lessons-learned for integration activities being conducted in military environments.

Integrated Learning (U) The Integrated Learning program is creating a new computer learning paradigm in which systems learn complex workflows from warfighters while the warfighters perform their regular duties. The effort is focused on military planning tasks such as air operations center planning and military medical logistics. With this learning technology, it will be possible to create many different types of military decision support systems that learn by watching experts rather than relying on expensive and error prone hand-encoded knowledge. The new learning paradigm differs from conventional machine learning in that it does not rely on large amounts of carefully crafted training data. Rather, in the new paradigm the learner works to \"figure things out\" by combining many different types of learning, reasoning, and knowledge. Such a cognitive system will ultimately need the capability to build and update its own internal model of the world and the objects in it without human input. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Enhanced integrated learning systems so the systems form explicit learning goals, make plans to achieve these goals, create hypotheses about learned knowledge where appropriate, and resolve sources of uncertainty in learned knowledge where it exists. - Expanded systems so they combine different types of knowledge and reasoning, based on the situation and information that is available. - Modified existing algorithms so they track uncertainty about information. - Evaluated systems by having them learn expanded/full processes and procedures for air control order planning and military medical evacuation planning.

Bootstrapped Learning (U) The Bootstrapped Learning program will provide computers with the capability to learn complex concepts the same way people do: from a customized curriculum designed to teach a hierarchy of concepts at increasing levels of complexity. Learning each new level depends on having successfully mastered the previous level's learning. In addition, the learning program will be \"reprogrammable\" in the field using the same modes of natural instruction used to train people without the need for software developers to modify the software code. At each level, a rich set of knowledge sources (such as training manuals, examples, expert behaviors, simulators, and references and specifications that are typically used by people learning to perform complex tasks) will be combined and used to generate concepts and a similar set of knowledge sources for the next level. This will enable rapid learning of complex high-level concepts, a capability which is essential for autonomous military systems that will need to understand not only what to do but, why they are doing it, and when what they are doing may no longer be appropriate.6.673 9.081 8.650 84UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #12 Page 9 of 26Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602304E COGNITIVE COMPUTING SYSTEMSPROJECT NUMBER 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Produced a prototype end-to-end system capable of bootstrapped learning, integrating different types of learning, input modalities, and repeatedly building on prior learning. - Developed a complete electronic curriculum for three domains, including prerequisite knowledge, teaching algorithms, as well as curriculum development tools. - Demonstrated the ability to learn a curriculum composed of at least three related lessons via at least three different interaction modalities and at least two different learning processes.

Machine Reading and Reasoning Technology* *Formerly Knowledge Representation and Reasoning Technology. (U) The Machine Reading and Reasoning Technology program will develop enabling technologies to acquire, integrate, and use high performance reasoning strategies in knowledge-rich domains. Such technologies will provide DoD decision makers with rapid, relevant knowledge from a broad spectrum of sources that may be dynamic and/or inconsistent. To address these significant challenges of context, temporal information, complex belief structures, and uncertainty, new capabilities are needed to extract key information and metadata, and to exploit these via context-capable search and inference (both deductive and inductive).

Therefore, advanced machine reasoning capabilities must extract knowledge from, and reason about, all types of multimedia data. This research will explore new computational models to enable command and control systems to use conceptual representations to perform perception-based cognition and to assist the commander in understanding and analyzing complex battlefield scenarios. Perception-based cognition and visual-spatial reasoning are of particular interest. (U) Machine reading addresses the prohibitive cost of handcrafting information by replacing the expert, and associated knowledge engineer, with un-supervised or self-supervised learning systems, systems that \"read\" natural text and insert it into AI knowledge bases, i.e. data stores especially encoded to support subsequent machine reasoning. Machine reading requires the integration of multiple technologies: natural language processing must be used to transform the text into candidate internal representations, and knowledge representation and reasoning techniques must be used to test this new information to determine how it is to be integrated into the system's evolving models so that it can be used for effective problem solving. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Demonstrated novel methods for acquiring new knowledge directly from processing natural language text. - Developed a proof-of-concept machine reading prototype that learned by reading small focused texts, encoded knowledge from these texts, and answered narrow queries that required deep semantic representations. FY 2009 Plans: - Extend knowledge representation to support machine reading of large (e.g. open source web) amounts of material with the goal of encoding and querying at broad, but shallow semantic levels. - Produce domain representations that enable semi-supervised approaches to knowledge acquisition.

Foundational Learning Technology (U) The Foundational Learning Technology program develops advanced machine learning techniques that enable cognitive systems to continuously learn, adapt and respond to new situations by drawing inferences from past experience and existing information stores. One very promising approach involves transfer learning techniques that transfer knowledge and skills learned for specific situations to novel, unanticipated situations and thereby enable learning systems to perform appropriately and effectively the first time a novel situation is encountered. This is essential because most military operations occur in ever-changing environments; U.S. forces and systems must be able to act appropriately and effectively the first time each novel situation is encountered. (U) The Foundational Learning Technology program will develop techniques that enable cognitive systems to reason about their own reasoning and, hence, learn a self model. This capability will allow the system to explain itself during learning, for example, by constructing memory traces of how reasoning occurred. Meta-level monitoring of traces then produces an explanation of why reasoning might fail, and introspection enables the construction of an explicit learning strategy driven by this self-model. (U) The Cortical Algorithm program will model the sub-symbolic \"instruction set\" of the brain. It will create a new, non-symbolic representation/reasoning paradigm based upon a universal algorithm that starts with zero knowledge and recursively builds upon learned knowledge through self-direction.

FY 2010 Plans: - Construct a single, general-purpose algorithm which could start with zero knowledge of its environment, and then grow to represent the structure latent in that environment. - Create a self-explaining module that helps debug agent programs by mapping anomaly symptoms to causal faults. - Build infrastructure to support reflective records of decision-making tied to behavior traces.

These capabilities will enable robotic vehicles to support warfighters in diverse environments including urban, ground, air, space, and underwater. A key objective is robust navigation and locomotion, since this underlies the ability to move through the difficult and unpredictable terrain of theater operations, which may include highly irregular and mountainous areas, partially-destroyed roads, rubble-filled urban terrain, and other vehicles and personnel. Efforts are being made to develop learning and reasoning technologies to address specific concerns in both wheeled and legged robotic systems. There is also interest in anthropomorphic humanoid robots that can leverage the worldwide infrastructure built for humans (e.g., occupy seats in transport vehicles, climb stairs, grasp knobs/handles and open doors, etc.) and free our soldiers from dangerous tasks such as search and rescue missions. (U) Robust Robotics is developing techniques for robots to perform in dynamic environments by improving robotic vision and scene understanding, including the capability to predict the future location and even the intent of moving objects. U.S. National security will require future autonomous systems that achieve a much higher autonomy level when performing complex tasks. Robust Robotics is developing techniques that will enable robotic agents to achieve effective levels of autonomous reasoning and manipulation whether humans are present or not. Robotic agents must also be able to effectively perform when they are part of a team and assume semi-independent roles across a variety of activities. This will be achieved by developing robotic systems that can accept and understand instructions to define new activities and their variants from human controllers. Robust Robotics is also addressing the need for future U.S. unmanned vehicles to perform reliably in the absence of GPS, which can be achieved by recognition of local features, including man-made and natural features, for navigation in diverse environments.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) The Collective Cognitive Systems and Interfaces project will dramatically improve warfighter and commander effectiveness and productivity using advanced cognitive approaches that enable faster, better informed, and more highly coordinated actions than those of our enemies. This will be accomplished by developing revolutionary methods that increase our information processing capabilities, enhance our situational awareness, and enable more cohesive group action by our forces. Critical technical areas addressed in this project include automated decision support, information sharing, and ensured communications. Cognitive decision support tools reason about tasks, timings, and interactions so that when plans change or the enemy does not respond as anticipated, U.S. forces can quickly adapt. The quality of such decisions and the effectiveness of our actions depend critically on our ability to take full advantage of all available information in a rapid and flexible manner. This requires the capability to share information and to automatically integrate distributed information bases for broad tactical battlespace awareness. Finally, team cohesion requires effective and reliable communication in difficult environments such as urban settings where radio signal propagation is complex. Here the approach is to develop cognitive communications management and control algorithms that reason about channel conditions, higher-level application connectivity requirements and related factors, and decide (often as a group) what parameters (e.g., frequency) each radio will use. The suite of programs under this project will significantly advance the military's ability to successfully deal with complex situations in operational environments. B. Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2011 Collaborative Cognition (U) The Collaborative Cognition program is aimed at developing technologies that enable individual cognitive agents to work together as a team to provide cooperative support to warfighters in complex military situations. Such situations typically require multiple coordinated tasks that involve information sharing and cooperative efforts. The Collaborative Cognition program will foster the design and implementation of collaborative software agents that operate in dynamic environments, and include both software agents and people. Applications include collaborative surveillance and reconnaissance, logistics re-planning and decision support for unanticipated operational changes, situational analysis and prediction tools, and warfighter/commander decision aids.

The Coordination Decision-Support Assistants (COORDINATORs) effort will develop cognitive software coordination managers that provide support to fielded tactical teams. The coordination managers will help fielded units adapt their mission plans in response to unanticipated changes in the mission by tracking personnel, resources, and situational changes, and proposing and evaluating options (adjustments to task timings, changes to task assignments and selection from pre-planned contingencies). This will enable fielded units to respond faster and more accurately to the dynamically changing battlefield situation, requiring far fewer personnel in the re-planning process. COORDINATORs is a distributed technology where a single COORDINATOR will be partnered with each tactical unit or team, and will be able to collaborate and coordinate with other tactical units to optimize needed mission changes. The Advanced Soldier Sensor Information System and Technology (ASSIST) effort will develop an integrated information system that exploits soldier-worn sensors to augment the soldier's ability to capture, report, and share information in the field. The ASSIST effort will develop an integrated system using advanced technologies for processing, digitizing and analyzing information captured and collected by soldier-worn sensors. ASSIST draws heavily on the experiences and lessons learned from previous Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) missions and other surveillance and reconnaissance missions. A baseline system will demonstrate the capture of video/still images together with voice annotations and location-stamping. The advanced system will demonstrate automatic identification and extraction of key objects, events, activities and scenes from soldier-collected data. The system will create knowledge representations that will serve as an input to an array of warfighter products including augmented maps, situational analysis tools, and query and answer capabilities.

These technologies will allow the military to focus its critical manpower resources on the mission rather than on the maintenance of its information systems and network infrastructure. Research in this area will create a radical new design for distributed computers, device networks, and the software to manage these systems. Cognitive information processing will be used to optimize networked communications based on current conditions, past experience and high-level user guidance. Robotic technologies will be employed where appropriate, for example, to maintain connectivity with small units and individual dismounts on the move. The Cognitive Networking program is also addressing the warfighter's need for actionable situational awareness in complex radio frequency (RF) environments. This work leverages advances in software-defined radio technology to achieve specific military goals. The program has interest in machine learning techniques that can enhance the effectiveness of jamming and other RF countermeasures. So-called \"cognitive jamming\" has the potential to deny the enemy's effective use of the RF spectrum. The Cognitive Networks effort funds three programs: SAPIENT, LANDroids, and BOSS. The Situation-Aware Protocols in Edge Network Technologies (SAPIENT) effort will develop a new generation of cognitive protocol architectures to replace conventional protocols that fare poorly in extreme network conditions and do not provide adequate service for key applications. Technology developed in the SAPIENT effort will have military utility wherever tactical communications are deployed. SAPIENT architectures will represent awareness with a knowledge base that is updated based on specification and observation. This technology enables the automatic adaptation of protocols to the operational environment. SAPIENT will exploit attributes of human cognition, such as learning and self-improvement, and apply them to the automated construction of network protocols. Key research challenges for the SAPIENT effort are the use of these cognitive attributes to dramatically reduce the effect of network impairments on applications while demonstrating a positive trend in this capability as new situations are encountered and learned. Desired capabilities include interoperable knowledge representations and rapid incorporation of new knowledge about applications, network conditions and building blocks from which new protocols can be constructed. 96UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #12 Page 21 of 26Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602304E COGNITIVE COMPUTING SYSTEMSPROJECT NUMBER Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 The Local Area Network droids (LANdroids) effort will give warfighters reliable communications in urban settings. LANdroids will accomplish this by creating robotic radio relay nodes that move autonomously to configure and maintain a communications mesh by reasoning about their positions relative to one another and relative to the warfighters. LANdroids will move as the warfighters move with the goal of maintaining warfighter connectivity throughout their operations. LANdroids will be pocket-sized so warfighters can carry several and drop or deploy them as they move through an area. The effort is creating both the intelligent radio control software and the small radio platform on which it runs. The technologies will be tested in a physical setting and at an operationally relevant scale. The Brood of Spectrum Supremacy (BOSS) effort will provide actionable situational awareness to the warfighter in complex radio frequency (RF) environments. BOSS adds collaborative processing capabilities to tactical software-defined radios to achieve specific military goals. BOSS exploits cooperative use of computational, communication and sensory capabilities in a software radio, in aggregate, to generate breakthrough capabilities in the warfighter knowledge of their surroundings, with a particular focus on RF-rich urban operations. The BOSS effort will initially focus on modeling and simulation, resulting in hardware-independent executable specifications of waveforms in an interoperable format. Once the modeling and simulation is verified, the BOSS effort will develop a prototype demonstration for a selected RF platform, using and refining the hardware-independent executable specifications of the waveforms. Ultimately this effort will develop Software Communications Architecture (SCA)-compliant waveforms suitable for implementation on a tactical software radio system.

The Cloud Computing program will create architectures to automatically integrate distributed information bases for broad tactical battlespace awareness. The Cloud Computing program will produce the infrastructure and application technologies needed to automate the integration of multiple media (text, video, and digital photographs) as well as its analysis, indexing, and storage so that it can be easily queried and retrieved by users across the DoD enterprise. Inherent to such ubiquitous availability of enterprise data is the need for strong security including fine-grained/role-based access controls. The Digital Object Storage and Retrieval (DOSR) effort is pursuing a network-based approach to information storage and management that will enable a network-based repository to hold all digital information. The DOSR repository will reside on the network and provide a mechanism for the virtual (i.e., logical, not physical) centralization of all enterprise information. DOSR technology will enable and facilitate controlled access to information by approved and authenticated users across administrative domains, and in this fashion it will enable transparent sharing of information across the enterprise. Repositories built on DOSR technology will, in addition, provide a single distributed platform/framework for additional document/content/information services including indexing, metadata creation, search, versioning, and records management, resulting in the warfighter's ability to take full advantage of all available pertinent information in a rapid and flexible manner. The Data Integration and Exploitation SystEm that Learns (DIESEL) effort will address a significant problem facing the warfighter: the lack of interoperability of \"stovepiped\" information systems. DIESEL will create a new suite of intelligent information integration tools that will learn to automatically understand heterogeneous information systems and integrate them into the existing information environment. The result will be more complete and reliable information as the basis for better decision-making for warfighters.

Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 Unconventional Therapeutics (U) This thrust is developing unique and unconventional approaches to ensure that soldiers are protected against a wide variety of naturally occurring, indigenous or engineered threats. Past successes in this effort have come from developing therapeutics that are designed to work against broad classes of pathogens. This has led to several significant transitions, a separate thrust in Anthrax countermeasures, and most recently a program at Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) that directly capitalizes on previous DARPA investments. Work in this area has also uncovered new approaches to therapeutics that, rather than attacking specific pathogens, enhance innate human immune mechanisms against broad classes of pathogens. Integral to these efforts is the development of methods that rapidly identify a broad spectrum of pathogens. Not only will these approaches be more effective against known pathogens, they also promise to offer substantial protection against unknown pathogens including engineered and emerging pathogens from third-world environments.26.235 20.470 22.950 105UNCLASSIFIED #13 Page 4 of 12Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602383E BIOLOGICAL WARFARE DEFENSEPROJECT NUMBER Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 (U) A current emphasis is on the discovery and development of technologies that will allow a rapid response (within weeks) to unanticipated threats, whether they are naturally encountered emerging diseases or agents from intentional attack. This thrust has a goal of radically transforming the protein design process by researching and developing new mathematical and biochemical approaches to the in silico design of proteins with specific functions. This program is also developing an interactive and functional in vitro human immune system using tissue engineering. This \"immune system\" will be able to test the efficacy of vaccines against threat agents that, at the present time, can only be tested in animal models. This significantly decreases the time needed and increases the probability of success for biological warfare vaccine development. An additional focus is the development of entirely new technologies that will allow the rapid, cost-effective manufacture of complex therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies and vaccine antigens; these technologies will reduce the time for biologics manufacture from years (or even decades) to only weeks.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 Hypersonics Flight Demonstration (HyFly) (U) The Hypersonics Flight Demonstration program (HyFly) will develop and demonstrate advanced technologies for hypersonic flight. The ultimate goal of the program is to demonstrate vehicle performance that could lead to an operational tactical surface launched missile range of 600 nautical miles. Specifically, the program will demonstrate an F-15 launched missile configuration with a range of 400 nautical miles, a maximum sustainable cruise speed in excess of Mach 6, and the ability to accurately terminate the missile on a GPS guided impact target. Technical challenges include the scramjet propulsion system, lightweight, high-temperature materials for both aerodynamic and propulsion structures, and guidance and control in the hypersonic flight regime. Based on the results of the first two test flights, subsystem components will be modified and a third flight test has been added to the program development schedule.

Super-Fast Submerged Transport (U) The Super-Fast Submerged Transport program (Underwater Express) will explore the application of supercavitation technology to underwater vehicles, enabling high speed transport of personnel and/ or supplies. The inherent advantages of traveling underwater are: the ability to transit clandestinely, no radar or visible signature, and avoidance of rough sea conditions that may limit or deny mission execution. Supercavitation places the vehicle inside a cavity where vapor replaces the water, and drag due to fluid viscosity is reduced by orders of magnitude, thus reducing the power requirement dramatically. This program will use modeling, simulation, and experiments and testing to develop the understanding of the physical phenomena associated with supercavitation and the application to underwater vehicles. Innovative failsafe controls will be required for stability and maneuverability at speed. The program will culminate in an at-sea demonstration of an unmanned vehicle capable of fully wetted to supercavitating operations and autonomous maneuvering. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Conducted modeling, simulations, and experiments to develop an understanding of cavity and vehicle interactions and the effect of these interactions on vehicle design, control and stability. - Modeled, simulated, and experimentally measured vehicle maneuvering and body forces in a controlled facility. - Developed vehicle and cavity scaling relationships.

Long Range Anti-Ship Missile Demonstration (U) In response to emerging threats, DARPA is building on the technology advances developed under the Hypersonics Flight (HyFly) demonstration program also funded in this project, to develop and demonstrate standoff anti-ship strike technologies to reverse the significant and growing U.S. naval surface strike capability deficit. The Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) program will invest in advanced component and integrated system technologies capable of providing a dramatic leap ahead in U.S. surface warfare capability, focusing on organic wide area target discrimination in a network denied environment, innovative terminal survivability in the face of advanced defensive systems, and high assurance target lethality approaches. Specific technology development areas will include robust precision guidance, navigation and control with GPS denial; multi-modal sensors for high probability target identification in dense shipping environments; and precision aimpoint targeting for maximum lethality. Component technologies will be developed, demonstrated, and integrated into a prototype demonstration weapon system. The program will result in high fidelity demonstration to support military utility assessment. Beginning in FY 2010, this program will be funded from PE 0603286E, Project AIR-01, Advanced Aerospace Systems.

Current unmanned surface platforms in development are adjuncts to be operated from and in support of conventional manned ships. The next step in full exploitation of this technology is larger scale unmanned vessels that can operate independently at the theater or global level, much like the Global Hawk unmanned air vehicle does today. By focusing on surface platforms that are never intended for a person to step aboard at any point in the operations cycle, an unexplored design space emerges without constraint on structure, stability, or crew support, in contrast to their significant impacts in conventional ship design. The ELEUSV program will explore how those overhead limitations can be converted into meaningful operational performance metrics such as speed, payload, survivability, or reduced construction cost. In order to make these radical ship designs operationally feasible, significant emphasis will be placed on automated maintenance and repair, system operational autonomy and command and control, and payload employment concepts. FY 2009 Plans: - Conduct analysis of unmanned naval vessel concepts and operational employment. - Identify core technologies required to enable unique large scale unmanned naval vessel capabilities. - Develop system concept designs and begin platform and payload preliminary design efforts.

Broad Ocean Demining (U) The Broad Ocean Demining program will develop and demonstrate technologies that allow for the rapid detection and direct neutralization of mines and other asymmetric littoral threats over broad areas. Current mine clearance approaches rely on expendable neutralizers to be placed on each mine target. The operational cost of emplacing each neutralizer demands extensive prior activity to positively differentiate mines from other mine like objects in the operating area, and to precisely locate the mine.000 .000 4.000 121UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #17 Page 8 of 63Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E TACTICAL NUMBER FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 target so that the neutralizer can be placed within its effective range. By developing technologies that can positively defeat in place mines without reliance on expendable neutralizers, the Broad Ocean Demining program will reduce or eliminate these activities and demonstrate dramatic acceleration of area mine clearance timelines. By eliminating the need for explosive neutralizers, the program will also provide a credible mine clearance capability that can be readily dispersed and employed by military and non-military entities to improve rapid contingency response. Technologies and approaches will be explored for the range of littoral threats to enhance naval force operational freedom and effectiveness. FY 2010 Plans: - Identify core technologies to enable affordable and effective defeat of littoral threats. - Develop broad ocean demining architectural concepts and system plans. - Implement selected operational system design efforts. - Conduct risk reduction demonstrations of critical enabling technologies.

Submersible Aircraft (U) This program will combine the speed and range of an airborne platform with the stealth of an underwater vehicle by developing a vessel that can both fly and submerge. The project will exploit lightweight materials, unique dynamic structures and advanced propulsion systems to overcome the technical barriers to achieving this capability. If successful, the project will enable insertion and extraction of special operations and expeditionary forces at greater ranges, and higher speeds, in locations not previously accessible; with minimal direct support from additional military assets. The program goals are to demonstrate a vessel capable of multimodal operations (airborne, surface, and submerged) and that can easily transition between these modes.

Given the trend of submarine quieting, passive sonar is of diminishing value to the Navy for large area searches. The existing alternatives are high power active sonar systems which are overt and difficult to use in peace time given concerns for the environment. The program will investigate new approaches which exploit acoustic energy spread over space or time as a means to counter the need for high peak power sonar. Once the challenges of low power, complex interference and propagation are overcome, complete new strategies and systems for active sonar will emerge.

The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that will enhance the military's effectiveness while decreasing the exposure of U.S. or allied forces to enemy fire. B. Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 Guided Projectiles (U) The Guided Projectiles program is developing and demonstrating highly maneuverable gun-launched projectiles, and associated fire control and launch systems for employment against critical enemy infrastructure and point targets, such as command, control and communication nodes and radars. This program will develop enabling technologies to give U.S. warfighters the ability to allow weapons platforms, such as mortars, to receive updated target information from other munitions or sense target changes on their own. Based upon this information, the accuracy and effectiveness of the weapons are increased and the potential for collateral damage is reduced. This program will adapt recent advances in communications, computers, sensing and propellants/explosives to demonstrate significant leaps in combat capability. The technologies developed will demonstrate the increased combat effectiveness and the reliability of distributed, collaborative processing and mission execution. (U) The program developed low-cost, non-imaging optical seeker/guidance technology exploiting technology development in the visible and infrared spectrum, designed to replace the current 60mm mortar fuse and improve firing precision. Additionally, research was conducted with explosives to improve the effectiveness of 60mm explosive rounds.

(U) This program will now leverage the innovative low-cost optical seeker technology to develop an affordable fuse-guidance package that converts a conventional 81mm or 120mm mortar round into a precision-guided munition. This program will further extend this development to the development of laser-guided munition systems wing-dropped from tactical UAVs and guidable from the on-board laser designator to any target within the field of view (FOV) of the designator. Critical developments supporting this program include component or packaging development technologies that enable the guidance sensors and actuators to sustain the 20-40,000g peak launch stresses, and the development of guidance systems that integrate low-cost GPS and terminal laser lock-on. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Developed a low-cost optical seeker applicable to 81mm and 120mm mortar rounds and UAV-borne munitions. FY 2009 Plans: - Design integration plan for incorporating test seeker-guidance system on large caliber (81mm or 120mm) mortar rounds. Recognize Improvised Explosive Devices and Report (RIEDAR) (U) The goal of the Recognize Improvised Explosive Devices and Report (RIEDAR) program is to develop and demonstrate a capability for standoff detection of various devices. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Demonstrated laser filamentation at 100 meters using low power lasers. FY 2009 Plans: - Demonstrate operation of compact, tunable lasers from deep ultraviolet (UV) to near infrared (NIR).3.103 6.704 3.000 126UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #17 Page 13 of 63Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E TACTICAL NUMBER 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2010 Plans: - Develop integrated sub-system consisting of optical detector and compact laser for detection of explosives. Magneto Hydrodynamic Explosive Munition (MAHEM) (U) The Magneto Hydrodynamic Explosive demonstrate compressed magnetic flux generator (CMFG)-driven magneto hydrodynamically formed metal jets and self-forging penetrators (SFP) with significantly improved performance over explosively formed jets and fragments. Explosively formed jets (EFJ) and SFP are used for precision strike against targets such as armored vehicles and reinforced structures. Current technology uses chemical explosive energy to form the jets and fragments. This is highly inefficient and requires precise machining of the metal liners from which the fragments and jets are formed. Generating multiple jets or fragments from a single explosive is difficult, and the timing of the multiple jets or fragments cannot be controlled. MAHEM offers the potential for higher efficiency, greater control, the ability to generate and accurately timed multiple jets and fragments from a single charge, and the potential for aimable, multiple warheads with a much higher EFJ velocity, hence increased lethality precision, than conventional EFJ/SFP. MAHEM could be packaged into a missile, projectile or other platform, and delivered close to target for final engagement. This could provide the warfighter with a means to address stressing missions such as: lightweight active self-protection for vehicles (potential defeat mechanism for a kinetic energy round), counter armor (passive, reactive, and active), mine countermeasures, and anti-ship cruise missile final layer of defense. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Refined existing modeling capability and augmented with new modeling tools to replicate performance of various experiments, allowing identification of issues computationally as well as allowing iteration on initial designs to improve performance. - Continued helical generator (HG) design and fabrication. - Completed component and full unit testing at the Air Force Research Laboratory Chestnut Explosive Test Site. - Designed and tested an end-initiated, shorter, 'unified' generator.3.981 3.705 3.215 127UNCLASSIFIED #17 Page 14 of 63Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E TACTICAL NUMBER 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2009 Plans: - Test a static prototype of a self-contained MAHEM munition to demonstrate the ability to package a MAHEM device into an AT4-CS form factor including setback and jet penetration tests.

Lightweight Ceramic Armor (LCA) (U) The Lightweight Ceramic Armor (LCA) program leverages recent breakthroughs in novel ceramic fabrication processes developed in the Materials Processing Technology project to drive a dramatic performance shift in the tradeoff between weight and ballistic projectile protection of body armor. Currently fielded Boron Carbide body armor is heavy and limited in the diversity of shapes that may be molded. Its weight and bulk limit a soldier's agility and mobility, and its cost prohibits consideration of using it to protect vehicles. Recent breakthroughs in ceramics processing technology offers the opportunity for cost effective fabrication of molded shapes, the retention of nanostructured grains for significantly higher energy dissipation, a fifty percent reduction in weight for equal ballistic protection, and similar reduction in cost. The focus areas of the program are: the optimization of the material composition and nanostructure for maximum protection per unit weight and cost, and scale up of the fabrication technology to body armor size scale articles. The program will additionally investigate the potential for the development of dramatically improved ballistic armored headgear along these same lines. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Developed lightweight ceramic armor with high dynamic tensile stress to effectively dissipate shock waves. - Investigated backing materials or materials systems for optimized energy dissipation characteristics when used in combination with this new class of ceramics. - Developed improved processing of initial ceramic powder materials for improved ceramic performance, part yield, and yielded cost.6.114 5.426 2.000 128UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #17 Page 15 of 63Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E TACTICAL NUMBER 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2009 Plans: - Develop and model a scalable manufacturing process design for a pilot scale fabrication system capable of producing sufficient high performance ceramic material plates to support the end-manufacture of 1,000 systems per month. - Validate an initial fifteen percent reduction in weight for equal performance compared to currently fielded Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts (ESAPI) armor inserts. - Optimize integrated backing materials - ceramic armor materials systems for minimum weight at ESAPI ballistic performance. - Evaluate the characteristics of an optimized LCA system optimized for minimum weight at ESAPI ballistic performance. - Investigate the potential for significantly improved ballistic characteristics of meta-structured ceramic systems incorporating multiple materials layers in a monolithic plate. - Validate a thirty percent reduction in weight for equal performance compared to currently fielded ESAPI armor inserts. - Develop and evaluate initial concepts for ballistic headgear incorporating the LCA materials.

Crosshairs (U) The Crosshairs program seeks to develop a vehicle mounted, threat detection, and countermeasure system that will detect, locate, and engage enemy shooters against a variety of threats to include bullets, Rocket Propelled Grenades (RPGs), Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs), and direct fired mortars, both stationary and on the move. Threat identification and localization will be accomplished in sufficient time to enable both automatic and man-in-the-loop responses. Phase I of the program focused on initial development and testing of the Crosshairs sensor system. Phase IA culminated with a static live fire test to determine the most effective candidate sensor system. During Phase IB, enhancements were made to the sensor system for on the move performance, and on the move testing against multiple threats was conducted.

Phase IIA consists of a moving demonstration of the hardened, packaged, and enhanced Phase I sensor system on two networked HMMWVs (Humvee), integration with candidate response systems, and testing and evaluation of the complete systems in relevant environments. The goal of Phase IIB will be to integrate the final Crosshairs system with an appropriate active protection system (APS). (U) The Concept of Operations is to provide a military vehicle with a mounted detection and response system that operates both stationary and on the move. Bullets will be detected and localized using the acoustic DARPA-developed Boomerang v2.5 acoustic gunfire detection system. Radar detection of all other threats will be made using the Crosscue radar. The Crosscue radar is a dual mode, continuous wave, and pulsed Doppler radar, which will be used to determine range, velocity, and azimuth of the incoming threat. It is envisioned that the system will provide a significantly improved capability to detect and respond to incoming threats during hostile and peacekeeping operations in both urban and non-urban environments. Technology challenges include: low false alarm rate, algorithm development, high speed sensor and data processing for 360 degree azimuth and sixty degree elevation detection zone; robust data collection to locate firing source; and fast response time. The program will culminate with a demonstration of two prototype systems in a typical combat environment. Additionally, the program is investigating the feasibility of a variety of technologies to detect enemy shooters before the firing of a weapon.

Smaller vehicle weights enable effective deployability in helicopters or C-130 aircraft for vertical envelopment. This program seeks to achieve an optimal mix of manned and unmanned technologies in a small, well protected, highly deployable combat vehicle. By utilizing automation technologies in vehicle driving and vehicle payload systems (reconnaissance sensors and weapons), a single crew person in the combat vehicle can effectively drive and operate payloads concurrently at appropriate times while still providing high-level supervisory control over all systems. At mission critical times, the crew person can be removed and supervisory control can be given off-board from a separate controlling vehicle. The key technologies that enable a Small Combat Vehicle with Robotic Operation include sensor-based autonomous and semi-autonomous navigation, robust indirect driving (via combinations of cameras, perception-generated views of the terrain, or teleoperation), robust supervisory semi-autonomous control and teleoperation to allow vehicle operation from another vehicle, high density low-weight armor, aided target acquisition and targeting-based remote weapons stations, effective but minimalist warfighter-machine interfaces for crew person interaction with semi-automated driving and payload systems, and high performance vehicle mobility systems (suspensions and drivetrains).

In order to achieve high off-boresight targeting capability, current optical turret designs protrude into the flow. This causes severe aero-optic distortions in the aft field of regard due to turbulence in the wake and the unsteady shock movement over the aperture. These distortions decrease the power flux on target (the measure of lethality for a directed energy system) and consequently limit the directed energy system to targets in the forward field of regard. This program will optimize flow control strategies for pointing angles in the aft field of regard. The program will also explore the ability of the flow control system to be synchronized with adaptive optics. This effort will initially focus on wind tunnel testing to prove the feasibility of steady and periodic flow control techniques to reduce or regularize the large scale turbulent structures surrounding an optical turret. These tests will now culminate in a hardware-in-the-loop demonstration utilizing flow control with an adaptive optics system in a full-scale wind tunnel test for the turret. Following successful wind tunnel demonstrations, a preliminary design of a flight test turret incorporating flow control will be undertaken. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Initiated trade studies and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses. - Characterized turret aero-optical performance with CFD analysis and small-scale wind tunnel testing. - Downselected to preferred turret configuration.

Discharge Excited Catalytic Oxygen Iodine Laser (DECOIL)* *Formerly Air Laser. (U) The objective of the Discharge Excited Catalytic Oxygen Iodine Laser (DECOIL) program is to investigate the potential of the electric oxygen iodine lasers to make maximum use of air (80%N2/20%O2) in the laser device. The DECOIL device is an alternative to the well known chemical oxygen iodine laser (COIL) developed in 1977 and scaled to megawatt (MW) levels. DECOIL offers the potential of an open or closed cycle, electrically powered system with minimal stored consumables, no toxic, complex, and massive chemical storage and handling, and all the advantages of COIL such as excellent beam quality, operation in an atmospheric window, and high power operation. The goals of the DECOIL program are to demonstrate 1 kilowatt laser output, and develop a preliminary design for a 150 kilowatt laser system.1.000 2.000 .000 148UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #17 Page 35 of 63Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E TACTICAL NUMBER 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Developed and demonstrated a 1 kW output power laser design.

Efficient Mid-Wave Infrared Lasers (EMIL) (U) The Efficient Mid-Wave Infrared Lasers (EMIL) program will develop efficient solid-state coherent sources to cover the atmospheric transmission bands in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR; 3-5 micrometers). Infrared countermeasure (IRCM) systems in particular depend on intense sources at these bands. The current generation IRCM systems utilize diode-pumped Thulium (Tm) lasers used to pump optical parametric oscillators, most commonly based on zinc germanium phosphide. (U) The lasers developed in this program will operate across the three relevant bands within the MWIR at 10 W power with wall plug efficiencies of at least 10 percent. By virtue of the enormous volumetric reduction (100-1000 times), power reduction (ten times), and superior pulse format (cw-operation), such sources will enable new architectures and approaches permitting IRCM systems to be deployed on platforms (e.g., rotocraft) which are highly vulnerable to Man Portable Air Defense Systems and other threats but for which current IRCM systems are prohibitive or are inadequate (e.g., unable to defeat staring sensors). At least two diode-based laser approaches will be explored in this program, both involving antimonide-based compound semiconductor materials. These include intersubband-based quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) and type-II antimonide lasers, including so-called \"W-configuration\" approaches, the name taken from the shape of the conduction band profile.

Defense of aircraft against incoming IR guided missiles, especially man-portable air-defense systems, represents a crucial capability with vital applications in both the military and commercial sectors. (U) Two technologies will be developed in this program. The first technology is based on a Thulium: yttrium lithium fluoride (YLF) thin slab lasers operated in a zigzag configuration to preserve beam quality at high average power. This laser offers the ability to store the energy invested in population inversion for up to 500 microseconds so that efficient, Q-switched formation of short pulses is possible. In addition, this laser system can provide the required 100 nanometer tunability as well as efficient operation with available ultra-high efficiency pump diodes. This concept offers near-diffraction limited beam quality and output power scalable to levels ultimately required for negation of IR detectors at long range. (U) The second technology is a laser based on double-clad erbium (Er)-doped zirconium with 975 nanometer wavelength laser diode bars. Using 4 meter long fiber, researchers have demonstrated 9 Watts of continuous-wave output at 3 micrometers. To achieve this power increase, the natural population-inversion bottleneck caused by the longer lifetime of the lower laser level relative to the upper laser level for the Er atoms was overcome by using a heavily Er-doped ZBLAN double-clad fiber. A technique called energy-transfer upconversion was used, in which an energy-transfer process between Er ions solves the population bottleneck and increases the output power. The laser was pumped with 43 Watts of optical power and its slope efficiency was over twenty-one percent. The infrared output was limited by optical damage of the pumping end facet. The challenge is to produce ZBLAN fibers capable of withstanding higher optical fluxes and longer wavelength emission.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) Aeronautics Technology efforts will address high payoff opportunities that dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced aeronautical systems and/or provide revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military mission requirements. This includes advanced technology studies of revolutionary propulsion and vehicle concepts, sophisticated fabrication methods, and examination of novel materials for aeronautic system applications. B. Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 Helicopter Quieting (U) Studies and analysis of military helicopter operations have shown that the survivability and lethality of U.S. helicopters can be increased by reducing the range at which their acoustic signature can be detected and recognized. The goal of the Helicopter Quieting program is to advance the capability to analytically develop advanced rotor technologies that can dramatically improve the survivability of military rotor systems, while enabling improvements to performance, affordability, availability and suitability. A critical element toward this goal is to create and demonstrate a physics-based design toolset that enables analytical design of novel rotor systems and rotorcraft for reduced acoustic susceptibility (detection and recognition) by human and electro-acoustic threats. (U) Current rotor development is very costly, involving a time-consuming iterative, trial and error cycle of analysis and model wind tunnel tests, or occasionally, a faster but much riskier analysis path directly to full-scale wind tunnel/flight test. Additionally, the primary limitation of existing computational models is their inability to accurately predict the pressure distribution on a rotor blade and in the flowfield away from the blade. Novel and creative concepts and ideas are being employed in this program for accurate aerodynamic analysis of helicopter rotor airloading, flowfield, and wakes using high-end computational fluid dynamics techniques. The program will develop tools capable of accurate prediction of the noise signature of advanced, rotor concepts that exhibit a significant reduction in low-frequency in-plane signatures.9.900 6.000 3.800 156UNCLASSIFIED Page 43 of 63Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E TACTICAL NUMBER FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 (U) This program will also undertake the development of propagation and perception modeling for rotorcraft acoustic signatures within state-of-the-art visualization architectures. Multiple advanced human perception and cueing models will be developed as a part of the integrated acoustic design and analysis environment. The ability of the toolset to accurately characterize the differences in these factors will support design decisions for advanced rotors and rotorcraft that exhibit dramatically reduced perceptibility. The toolset will also enable assessment of operational tactics, techniques, and procedures, to include pilot technique, toward optimization for survivability. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Validated and applied high-fidelity, physics-based rotor acoustic predictive tools for rotors that exhibit complex aerodynamic phenomena atypical of conventional, fielded rotorcraft. FY 2009 Plans: - Deploy near real-time mission planning and visualization tool set capturing and displaying the rotorcraft's acoustic probability of detection. - Complete and deliver Beta test software for supersonic show-of-force missions.

Key enabling technologies include: flapping and rotary wing aerodynamics, kinematics and flight dynamics, lightweight aeroelastically tailored wing structures, miniature navigation systems, micro-propulsion systems, small payloads, and the ability to perch like a bird. This effort will also examine novel materials that can be used to develop integrated wing structures, which change composition to achieve multiple expressions. The program would result in the use of vehicles, which could be camouflaged, or blend into the surrounding landscape, enabling in-theater disposal and prevention of mission detection/compromise.

The system will provide helicopter signature emulation of a variety of battlefield helicopters. BHE could be used for mine clearing/ route determination as well as escort missions. An operational system could draw fire from ground based adversaries, and relay the information back to the operator for off-board location and prosecution. The system offers the opportunity to protect a large number of military aircraft assets and crews over long periods without aircraft performance impact. The reduced acoustic perception distance enabled by the BHE system can reduce the risk to Army and Special Operations Command helicopters from ground fire, small arms, rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), and anti- helicopter mines (AHMs).

The concept involved utilizing multiple small engines to provide the thrust for the aircraft, and to allow the engines to be more readily integrated with the aircraft structure and the aerodynamics of the wing. FY 2009 Plans: - Conducted trade studies on aircraft sizing for short field take-off and landing and to determine the benefits of alternative propulsion systems in a distributed propulsion system. - Evaluated conceptual designs of distributed embedded propulsion concepts and assess aerodynamic performance. Drag Reduction Flight Demonstration* *Formerly Laminar Flow Flight Demonstration. (U) The Drag Reduction Flight Demonstration effort will explore the development of an extended laminar flow wing, with the potential for a drag reduction of up to twenty-five percent compared to a typical fully turbulent wing, and the development of a formation flight capability, with drag reduction up to seventeen percent compared to solo flight aircraft. In addition, this program will evaluate and demonstrate the ability for autonomous aircraft to compensate for arbitrary loss of flight control, e.g. due to battle damage. Crossflow instabilities dominate the transition process for swept wings. Recent advances in theoretical understanding of the crossflow receptivity and transition process have led to innovative, passive control concepts for the crossflow transition process. Test facilities are not available to demonstrate this flight concept in a quiet flow environment at flight-representative Reynolds numbers and Mach numbers. Flight testing a swept wing laminar flow control concept appears to be the most direct route to validation of this technology, enabling future aircraft designs to adopt passive crossflow control devices as a proven technology. Formation flight is used in nature by geese and other migratory birds to reduce drag, but requires the development of an autonomous system to maintain the optimum position for drag reduction to be practical for long duration aircraft flights. Flight testing a formation flight configuration will allow structural excitation, and vehicle dynamic response to be addressed in proximity to the lead aircraft wake.2.000 4.300 7.000 160UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #17 Page 47 of 63Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E TACTICAL NUMBER 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Evaluated design constraints for laminar flow wings. - Tested limits of damage tolerant control approach, including an initial implementation of automatic supervisory adaptive control. - Assessed potential aerodynamic benefit of 2 and 3 aircraft formations.

FY 2010 Plans: - Initiate design of flight test experiment. - Initiate design of laminar flow wing for demonstration. - Collect flight test data to assess autopilot faults, alarms, and structural response of the aircraft wing in proximity to the aircraft wake. Disc-Rotor Compound Helicopter (U) The goal of the Disc-Rotor Compound Helicopter program is to design and demonstrate the enabling technologies required to develop a new type of compound helicopter capable of high-efficiency hover, high-speed flight, and seamless transition between these flight states. The aircraft will be equipped with an aft-swept wing, as well as a mid-fuselage disc with extendable rotor blades, enabling the aircraft to take-off and land like a helicopter. Transition from helicopter flight to airplane flight would be achieved by fully retracting the blades within the disc. An aircraft capable of long range high speed (300-400 kts) and Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL)/hover will provide mobility and responsiveness for troop and cargo insertion, satisfy an ongoing military interest for higher speed VTOL and hover capable vehicles, be survivable and bridge the gap in helicopter escort and insertion missions. The enabling technologies are disc-rotor configuration, variable thrust ducted prop-fans, the extension of the telescoping blades and seamless reversible transition between hover and wing borne flight.

Integrated Compact Engine Flow Path (U) The goal of the Integrated Compact Engine Flow Path program is to fully integrate the aircraft structure and propulsion flowpath. This will include development of a structurally integrated, load bearing, composite, thrust vectoring nozzle. Integration of compact inlets and nozzles that are lightweight and survivable continue to be a challenge in military aircraft design. Multiple distributed inlets and nozzles may allow a better integrated wing and propulsion system, exploiting aerodynamic control possible with engine blowing and suction. Existing metal nozzles are cantilevered off the engine face and the airframe, with an overlap region to allow for thermal growth. This approach to nozzle integration results in heavy, high maintenance nozzles and is structurally inefficient. It also poses a significant engine integration challenge and can drive vehicle sizing. A fully integrated nozzle, designed to take airframe loads through the nozzle, and built of a high temperature ceramic, would address the weight and structural integration problems directly. This approach would also be compatible with fluidic thrust vectoring and would result in a more compact, lighter, and more durable nozzle. This program will design, develop, and demonstrate a full scale, integrated engine flowpath in a direct-connect engine test. FY 2009 Plans: - Perform combined temperature and pressure testing of a representative full-scale nozzle throat section. - Confirm predictive capability of combined thermal and pressure loading structural strains. - Initiate design trade studies to develop a preferred nozzle design as well as a development and demonstration plan..000 4.000 5.000 162UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #17 Page 49 of 63Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E TACTICAL NUMBER 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2010 Plans: - Perform design studies for a dynamic loads test nozzle. - Perform detailed design of a ceramic matrix composite nozzle to be built of high temperature ceramics. - Assess benefits of an integrated engine flowpath on the aircraft performance. Active Rotor (U) The goal of the Active Rotor program is to develop and demonstrate enabling technologies that greatly enhance rotor control and performance, availability, sustainability, survivability, and affordability. Performance enhancement objectives are twenty-five percent improvement in endurance, range, and payload of existing helicopters. Sustainability includes increases in operational availability and readiness, and reductions in acoustic susceptibility. Enabling technologies include a dynamically controlled rotor, light-weight high-bandwidth on-blade actuators, and integrated vehicle flight control technologies. Over the past several decades, improvements in helicopter rotor performance have not kept pace with the increasing demands of the warfighter. This is apparent today in the high altitude environment of Afghanistan, where troop and materiel transport missions that are normally performed by the UH-60 Black Hawk are being performed by the much larger CH-47 Chinook due to the loss of performance in high/hot conditions. The Active Rotor program will mature the technologies to enable military aircraft such as the Black Hawk to operate effectively in this environment. The Active Rotor program will focus on development and demonstration of advanced technologies for application to future helicopter and tiltrotor and other rotorcraft platforms, with demonstration on a fielded system to enable application to new systems, and facilitate upgrade of current multi-service rotorcraft rotor systems. The effort will demonstrate technologies with broad applicability to military and commercial helicopters. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Identified promising technologies for advanced lightweight high-bandwidth on-blade actuators, and studied dynamically controlled rotor performance.

Adaptive Morphing Super-Maneuver Aircraft (AMSMA) (U) The goal of the Adaptive Morphing Super-Maneuver Aircraft (AMSMA) program, a follow-on to the Morphing Aircraft Structure (MAS) program previously funded in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-01, is to demonstrate the practicality and the operational value of morphing aircraft technology in a full scale flight demonstration. This effort will lay the foundation for multi-mission aircraft such as a Hunter- Killer UAV platform with revolutionary capability and more broadly, for a new approach to overall aircraft design. AMSMA will build on the small scale demonstrations of the MAS program which established that air vehicles able to seamlessly change configuration in flight are capable of achieving near optimum performance across a range of contradictory missions that would not otherwise be possible with conventional designs. Real-time in flight configuration changing will enable AMSMA to fly efficiently at high or low speeds, to maneuver akin to birds, and to be adaptively survivable. This program will demonstrate an advanced morphing, highly maneuverable air vehicle that achieves high fuel efficiencies, translating to very long endurance times, as much as ten times better than comparative aircraft. It will incorporate a combination of enabling technologies, including asymmetric wing sweep, fore and aft wing translation, and aero-elastic wings with adaptive hinge-less control actuation. If successful, AMSMA could eliminate traditional flying controls while achieving efficient aerodynamic and maneuver performance over a wide range of speeds and altitudes. Shape changing will also be used to establish a new approach to tailored survivability. The AMSMA vehicle has the potential to have a revolutionary impact on prosecution of time sensitive targets. The concept will introduce a capability whereby one aircraft with the ability to effect multiple radical configuration changes is enabled to conduct a range of missions optimally; this provides the prospect of significant affordability gains through reducing the number of different aircraft types in.000 4.000 6.200 164UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #17 Page 51 of 63Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E TACTICAL NUMBER FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 existing military fleets.

FY 2010 Plans: - Develop a morphing concept demonstrator vehicle configuration that will affordably demonstrate optimized mission segment performance (e.g. high-speed dash), will achieve full maneuver capability including extreme new maneuvers, and will optimize tailored survivability. Vulcan (U) Constant Volume Combustion (CVC) engines have been under development for more than a decade. Considerable progress has been made and the technology is believed mature enough to enable a dramatic new propulsion system capability. CVC engines, when combined with turbine engines, offer the ability to design a new class of Mach 4+ air breathing engines. The goal of the Vulcan demonstration program is to design, build and ground test an engine capable of accelerating a full scale hypersonic vehicle from rest to Mach 4+. Vulcan will leverage technology advances achieved by the ongoing Reusable Combined Cycle Propulsion (RCCP) program's High Speed Turbine Engine Demonstration (HiSTED) effort, which was previously funded from this project and has transferred to the Air Force Research Laboratory in accordance with the DARPA/AF MOA. The Vulcan engine will consist of a CVC engine, a full scale turbine engine, an inlet and a nozzle. CVC engine architectures could include Pulsed Detonation Engines (PDE's), Continuous Detonation Engines (CDE's) or other unsteady CVC engine architectures. The CVC engine would operate from below the upper Mach limit of the turbine engine to Mach 4+. The turbine engine will be a current production engine capable of operating above Mach 2. Key objectives of the program are to integrate the turbine engine into the Vulcan engine with minimal modification to the turbine engine, to operate the turbine engine from rest to its upper Mach limit, and to2.100 10.000 .000 165UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #17 Page 52 of 63Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E TACTICAL NUMBER FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 cocoon the turbine engine when it is not in use.

FY 2009 Plans: - Complete engine system requirements review. - Identify all technical risks and develop a critical technology development plan. - Develop Vulcan engine performance models. Transformer (TX) Vehicle (U) The Transformer (TX) Vehicle program will examine the feasibility and approaches for developing TX vehicles that can fly for two hours carrying a 1 to 4-person payload on one tank of fuel, can safely travel on roads, and can be operated by a typical soldier. The goal is to define the major components and overall design of a TX vehicle that would be suitable for military scouting, personnel transport, and logistics missions. Technical areas that will be explored include: hybrid electric drive ducted fan propulsion system, ring motors, energy storage methods such as batteries and ultra capacitors, morphing vehicle bodies, and advanced flight controls and flight management systems. The TX vehicle is intended to make roads irrelevant for military small unit maneuvers. These units can use TX air vehicles to fly over obstacles or impassible terrain, avoid ambushes and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Personal TX vehicles could be dispatched for downed airman recovery or for evacuating injured personnel from difficult to access locations, or to resupply isolated small units. Four-man versions would be suitable for enhanced company operations concepts which would allow the soldier/team to see the situation and pick the best place to \"drop in\" for urban operations.

Autonomous Aerial Refueling (U) The goal of the Autonomous Aerial Refueling program is to demonstrate the operational feasibility of high altitude refueling between unmanned, limited flight performance aircraft. The program will leverage legacy Global Hawk systems equipped with probe and drogue style refueling hardware and an autonomous refueling system. Specific challenges include achieving a repeatable probability of success with limited flight performance aircraft under high altitude conditions, redundant safe separation and unmanned flight operations, and complex systems integration. The primary benefit will be to enable developers of high altitude long endurance aircraft to confidently employ the advantages of air refueling that have proven so vital to manned aviation. The program will also foster a greater acceptance of increased autonomy in challenging battlespaces, and offers the potential for direct transition to the Global Hawk fleet.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) The Network Centric Enabling Technology project provides technology to build mission applications explicitly tailored to exploit the promise of network-centric system architectures. Mission applications include signal processing, detection, tracking, identification, situation understanding, planning, and control functions. These applications will integrate: 1) external sensors and processors that provide data on targets and mission contexts; 2) external platforms, both air and surface, that deliver sensors and munitions to designated areas; 3) intelligence processing systems at all levels of command; and 4) external communications networks that provide connectivity between computing nodes located on the platforms, at field command centers, and headquarters. The mission applications share data to form consistent battlespace understanding tailored to the needs of commanders at each node. The types of tailoring include common operational pictures, timelines, and resource usage descriptions. The mission applications also negotiate plans for future operations based on mission needs presented at each node. To maintain focus on operationally relevant problems, the project's technical goals are posed and evaluated in the context of mixed manned/unmanned forces. (U) Technologies developed in this project enable localized and distributed collaborative processing. This allows networks of sensors to rapidly adapt to changing force mixes, communications connectivity, and mission objectives while enabling distributed command and intelligence systems to effectively collaborate in a dynamic environment. Technologies are demonstrated and evaluated in the laboratory and in hardware-in-the-loop demonstrations. Demonstrations employ both stationary and autonomous mobile platforms. Operational benefits are: 1) smaller forward deployment of image and signal analysts in complex operating conditions including urban battlefields; 2) deeper understanding of the evolving stability and support operational environment; 3) consistent integration of target and environment information; and 4) flexible operational tactics and procedures to find evasive targets in difficult environments.

Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 Automated Battle Management (U) The Automated Battle Management program is developing novel technologies for multi-platform, automated battle management at the tactical level, in the air, on the ground, and within mobile sensor networks. Such technologies are required if U.S. forces are to keep up with the increasing pace of battle as more-capable platforms and higher-bandwidth communication networks become operational.

Some elements of these processes, such as collision avoidance and navigation, will be embedded in each platform. However, groups of platforms will be able to execute cooperative tactics to achieve coordinated effects. This cross-platform coordination and synchronization requires new technologies that can carry out aggregate maneuvers and tasks, while leveraging the functions embedded in each platform. (U) The Collaborative Networked Autonomous Vehicles (CNAV) effort will be the primary demonstration of Automated Battle Management techniques. CNAV will develop autonomous control methods to cause a distributed set of unmanned undersea vehicles to self-organize and distribute tasks through judicious transactions conveyed over a shared communications network. CNAV will utilize these capabilities to provide submerged target detection, localization, and tracking in restrictive littoral waters. CNAV provides this capability by creating a field of dozens or hundreds of vehicles, networked through acoustic wireless communications. The vehicles work collaboratively and autonomously to detect, classify, localize and track target submarines transiting the field. The field self-organizes to adapt to changes in target locations, environmental conditions, and operational factors. A reach-back capability allows reporting of field health and enables high-level orders and control functions to be provided to the field. CNAV will also result in a significant reduction in the cost per square mile for submerged target detection in littoral waters. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Performed intelligent routing of threat characteristic and track data through the field to alert CNAV nodes down stream to position or reposition for target pursuit and intercept. - Demonstrated fully autonomous and collaborative CNAV field deployment, autonomous field set-up and self-localization, and distributed common tactical operational picture. FY 2009 Plans: - Demonstrate collaborative automated target detection, classification, localization and tracking. - Demonstrate self-healing and reconfiguration, and threat pursuit and interception. - Demonstrate autonomous recharging, refueling and field establishments to autonomous field deployment. 169UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #17 Page 56 of 63Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E TACTICAL NUMBER FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 Video and Image Retrieval and Analysis Tool (VIRAT)* *Formerly Combat Zones that See. (U) The Video and Image Retrieval and Analysis Tool (VIRAT) program will develop and demonstrate a system for video data exploitation that enables an analyst to rapidly find video content of interest from archives and to provide alerts to the analyst of events of interest during live operations. The ability to quickly search large volumes of existing video data and monitor real-time video data for specific activities or events will provide a dramatic new capability to the U.S. military and intelligence agencies. Currently, video analysis for Predator and other aerial video surveillance platforms is very labor intensive, and limited to metadata queries, manual annotations, and \"fast-forward\" examination of clips. The software tools developed under VIRAT will radically improve the analysis of huge volumes of video data by: 1) alerting operators when specific events or activities occur at specific locations or over a range of locations and; 2) enabling fast, content-based searches of existing video archives. The VIRAT program is developing innovative algorithms for activity representation, matching and recognition which can support both indexing and retrieval. The primary focus of VIRAT is activity-based and dynamic information. Object/scene matching and recognition are also of interest, but only to the extent they support activity analysis. The final product of the VIRAT program is a system that can be transitioned to and integrated within an operational military system, such as the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS). FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Commenced video analysis algorithm development. - Began development of methodologies for defining descriptors of activities in video and associated indexing and search methods. FY 2009 Plans: - Continue developing a set of descriptors for activities in videos. - Continue developing an efficient indexing method for activity descriptors and an efficient search method against those indices. - Develop an interactive retrieval process to either alert the user or return to the user matching 'activities of interest'.7.000 16.241 15.159 170UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #17 Page 57 of 63Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 2 - Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E TACTICAL NUMBER FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 - Develop a system architecture.

Home Field (U) The Home Field program develops networked video and Laser Detection and Ranging (LADAR) processing technology to rapidly and reliably update a 3-Dimensional (3-D) model of an urban area. It provides 3-D situational awareness with sufficient detail and accuracy to remove the \"home field advantage\" enjoyed by opponents. Detailed mobility maps to support ground vehicle routing will be inferred and generated, and detailed visibility data to support sensor positioning will then be derived to maximize coverage and minimize detectability. High fidelity baselines will be created to support change detection to cue searches for targets and anticipate changes due to current or impending meteorological events. The program will supply real-time context information to sensor managers, maneuver controllers, weapons operators, and commanders. Furthermore, the program will filter natural change from artificial change indicative of human (threat) activity and permit operation of military forces in hostile terrain normally deemed favorable to opponents because of their historical familiarity with hide points, sight lines, and mobility characteristics. (U) Drawing upon technologies developed in the Home Field program, the Urban Photonic Sandtable Display (UPSD) program develops revolutionary interactive holographic displays for complex volumetric 3-D data to replace current 3-D visualization technologies that are either static or have limited effective field-of-view.

Applying the design fundamentals of the monochrome active grouping of pixels for a light modulator element into a single 3-D holographic pixel (hogel-based proof-of-concept) display and further developed module, a scalable and tileable laboratory prototype has been validated by transforming computer data to optical data, making sophisticated integration possible to optimize image quality. The UPSD program will develop an affordable 3-D display that operates at full video rate, displays red-green- blue (RGB) color, increases viewing angle, and increases display size. The result will be the world's first full-motion, full aspect 3-D imaging technology system. Utilizing the technologies developed under the Novel Technologies for Optoelectronics Materials Manufacturing (NTOMM) program in ELT-01, the Emissive Micro Displays program will develop technologies to support the fabrication of Low-cost High pixel density Power efficient Direct emission Microdisplays (LHPDM). Current microdisplay systems use light modulation systems (LCDs, DMDs,) and by using LHPDM, it will enable the transmission of larger fractions of light from the illumination source.

Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) (U) The Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) program develops and integrates a set of data analysis tools into a unified information system to support Theater Security Cooperation (TSC). The ICEWS system monitors, assesses and forecasts leading indicators of events that make countries vulnerable to crises. ICEWS technologies include quantitative and computational social science modeling and simulation, scenario generation, ontological modeling of security problems, advanced interactive visualization techniques, and agent-based programming. When integrated, these tools allow combatant commanders and their staff to understand and anticipate conditions that precipitate instability and conflict while there is still time to influence them. ICEWS also helps anticipate unintended consequences of actions taken to influence or remediate situations, consequences that may be delayed by months or years.

Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance (EXACTO)* *Formerly Laser Guided Bullet. (U) The Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance (EXACTO) program is developing a system that provides sniper teams with the ability to identify and engage targets with heretofore unobtainable range and accuracy against stationary and moving targets under difficult environmental conditions, either day or night. The system uses a combination of a maneuverable bullet and a real-time guidance system to track the target and deliver the projectile to target. Technology development includes the design and integration of aero-actuation controls, power sources, and sensors. The components must fit into the limited volume (2cm to the third power) of a 50-caliber projectile and be designed to withstand a high acceleration environment. When integrated and tested, this system will greatly increase the effectiveness of two-man sniper teams, regardless of the environmental conditions and the time of day.

Digital Media Exploitation (MEDEX) (U) The Digital Media Exploitation (MEDEX) program will develop technology to extract intelligence of tactical value from digital media found on computers captured in the field of operations. MEDEX will automatically search content (text documents, audio files, images, videos, applications, etc.) and identify data of high intelligence value. Traditionally, the objective of a digital media exploitation system has been to extract content for later analysis, so accuracy (e.g., precision and recall) and scalability to multiple processors for large data volumes have been emphasized. However, warfighters may have very limited time to process the data for key evidence that may result in tactical advantage; therefore, speed and accuracy are critical. The MEDEX program will develop digital media exploitation technology suitable for tactical environments which have constrained computational resources, accelerated operational timelines, and specific intelligence objectives. The MEDEX program will develop fast algorithms and techniques for processing evidence from digital media to deliver distilled intelligence that is accurate and scalable to large datasets, and can execute quickly on a single mobile computing platform, such as a notebook or ultraportable PC.

Strategic Communication Assessment and Analysis System (SCAAS) (U) The Strategic Communication Assessment and Analysis System (SCAAS) program will develop new theories, concepts, tools and systems to formulate and assess sound strategic communication strategies and measure their effectiveness in influencing allies, adversaries, and other constituencies around the world. Effective strategic communication is central to our ability to effectively deter adversaries, reassure allies, dissuade future competitors, and communicate our resolve to defeat enemies should deterrence fail. The capability developed under SCAAS would have dramatic value to combatant commands as it would enable the influencing of diverse people and organizations abroad towards U.S. National Security interests. FY 2009 Plans: - Develop models to continuously analyze/assess the strategic communications \"information environment\" from multiple perspectives and levels of analysis, including audience, context transmitters, and time. - Develop models for mapping influences to perceptions (such as influences of cultural context, cognitive and emotional biases on message reception and interpretation).

Maintaining Combat Performance (U) The Maintaining Combat Performance thrust utilizes breakthroughs in biology and physiology to sustain the peak physical and cognitive performance of warfighters operating in extreme conditions. Today, warfighters must accomplish their missions despite extraordinary physiologic stress. Examples of these stressors include extremes of temperature (-20 degrees F to 125 degrees F), oxygen deficiency in mountains, personal loads in excess of 100 lbs, dehydration, psychological stress, and even performance of life-sustaining maneuvers following combat injury. Not only must troops maintain optimum physical performance, but also peak cognitive performance, which includes the entire spectrum from personal navigation and target recognition, to complex command and control decisions, and intelligence synthesis. The Maintaining Combat Performance thrust leverages breakthroughs in diverse scientific fields in order to mitigate the effects of harsh combat environments. For example, understanding the natural mechanisms for core body temperature regulation in hibernating mammals has led to a novel, practical approach for soldier cooling, which is now being evaluated by troops in the far forward combat areas. Other examples include fundamental research elucidating the biological mechanisms of adaptation to extreme altitude, the molecular correlates of muscle fatigue and psychological stress, and natural resistance to disease through dietary nutrients.

Neovision2 (U) Biological vision systems have the exquisite ability to recognize, categorize, and learn new objects in fractions of a second. While animals and humans accomplish this seemingly effortlessly and constantly, computational vision systems have, to date, been unable to replicate this feat of biology. The Neovision2 program is pursuing an integrated approach to developing an advanced object recognition capability based on the visual pathways in the mammalian brain. Specifically, this program will develop a cognitive sensor technology with limited size, weight, and power that transforms data from an imaging sensor suite into communicable knowledge for mobile, autonomous surveillance systems.

Tactical Biomedical Technologies (U) The Tactical Biomedical Technologies thrust will develop new approaches to deliver life-saving medical care on the battlefield, as well as novel technologies for reconstruction and rehabilitation of severely injured warfighters. Implicit in this thrust is the fact that there are unique, warfighter-specific challenges in acute and chronic treatment that are not addressed by civilian research and development. Today, more than half of American battlefield fatalities are due to hemorrhage, particularly due to improvised explosive devices (IEDs). To prevent these deaths, there is an urgent need for technologies that enable relatively unskilled personnel (battlefield medics) to diagnose and treat injuries, including the ability to locate and coagulate non-compressible deep bleeders in the thorax or abdomen. Other critical needs stem from the fact that warfighters are frequently victims of blasts, causing patterns of brain, burn, and orthopedic injuries not seen in civilian medical practice. As such, there is a unique military need to develop systems for pain control that are safe even in medically unmonitored environments, such as an active battlefield. Once lives are saved, there is an unmet need for new methods to restore function, for example, by restoring long segments of bone that were lost due to blast fragmentation.

Neuroscience Technologies (U) The Neuroscience Technologies thrust leverages recent advances in neurophysiology, neuro-imaging, cognitive science and molecular biology to sustain and protect the cognitive functioning of the warfighter faced with challenging operational conditions. Warfighters experience a wide variety of operational stressors, both mental and physical, that degrade critical cognitive functions such as memory, learning, and decision making. These stressors also degrade the war fighter's ability to multitask, leading to decreased ability to respond quickly and effectively. Currently, the long-term impact of these stressors on the brain is unknown, both at the molecular and behavioral level.

The situation will get worse as the \"hoppers\" proliferate, even interfering within the receive channels of one another. At present there is no solution to this problem, other than turning off the receivers when communicating. A general solution would be to use \"brick-wall\" front-end filters for the receivers, retuning at the rate of the hoppers, if such agile filters were available. High-temperature superconducting (HTS) filters have been used very successfully for negating strong transmissions at nearby frequencies, and are unique in their ability to totally reject out-of-band signals without attenuation of signals in the pass-band. However, they have been used only for rejection of fixed-frequency interference.

It is expected that such ADCs would have a dramatic impact on signals intelligence capabilities such as direct down conversion of ultra high frequency through X-band radio frequency (RF) signals. Furthermore, ADCs enabled by this program alleviate the current ADC bottleneck in high capacity digital RF communications links by enabling more spectrally efficient wideband waveforms.

An additional focus of the NTOMM program is the development of technologies to support the fabrication of low-cost high pixel density power efficient direct emission microdisplays. Current microdisplay systems use light modulation systems (Liquid Crystal Displays, Digital Micromirror Devices) and consequently only transmit a small fraction of the light from the illumination source thus limiting efficiency and use.

Cognitively Augmented Design for Quantum Technology (CAD-QT) (U) The Cognitively Augmented Design for Quantum Technology (CAD-QT) program will enable rapid design, prototyping, and high-yield manufacture of next generation electronic, photonic, and magnetic devices that fully exploit quantum effects. One foundation of modern semiconductor electronics is that numbers of electronic carriers (electrons and holes) is large and this allows designers to rely on simple, semi-classical statistical models. As device dimensions become progressively smaller, quantum effects can no longer be treated as semi-classical statistical events and a complete and detailed quantum representation must be utilized. However, from the perspective of the human designer, quantum mechanics without statistical models is highly counterintuitive. The CAD-QT program will apply advances in robust optimization, dimensionality reduction, and modeling build tools for enhancing designer intuition for complex quantum systems optimized for high function and high yield under manufacturing variations.

Additionally, the integrated phase control will provide the unprecedented ability to rapidly change the number of simultaneous beams, beam profile, and power-per-beam, thus opening a whole new direction in operational capability. Key technical challenges include the ability to achieve the needed facet density (facet pitch should be on the order of a wavelength or two), control the relative phase across all facets equivalent to 9-bits, and efficiently couple and distribute coherent light to facets from a master laser oscillator with an integrated waveguide structure.

The objective of the program is to enhance sensitivity, resolution, and effectiveness of electromagnetic sensors beyond what is classically possible. The theoretical proof stage of the Quantum Sensors program was funded in FY 2007 and 2008 under PE 0601101E, Project MS-01. In that stage, sensors that propagate entangled light out to and back from a target (Type I) were proven to be ineffective when realistic scattering and absorption occur between the source and the target. Sensors that propagate classical light to the target but use entangled light only in the receiver (Type II) were shown to provide qualitative advantages over their classical counterparts. These include compensation for soft aperture losses using squeezed vacuum injection and compensation for detectors' quantum inefficiency using noiseless amplification. A new approach that retains entangled light in the receiver and transmits it to the target (Type III) was discovered and promises substantial enhancements over detection and imaging of targets in the presence of high levels of noise and loss.

Self-HEALing mixed-signal Integrated Circuits (HEALICs) (U) The goal of the Self-HEALing mixed-signal Integrated Circuits (HEALICs) program is to develop technologies to autonomously maximize the number of fully operational mixed-signal systems-on-a-chip (SoC) per wafer that meet all performance goals in the presence of extreme process technology variations, environmental conditions, and aging. This program is an outgrowth of mixed signal development in the Design Tools for 3-Dimensional Integrated Circuit program. Virtually all DoD systems employ mixed-signal circuits for functions such as communications, radar, navigation, sensing, high-speed image and video processing. A self-healing integrated circuit is defined as a design that is able to sense undesired circuit/ system behaviors and correct them automatically. The motivation for this program came from findings under the TRUST program that, as semiconductor process technologies are being scaled to even smaller transistor dimensions, there is an exponential increase in intra-wafer and inter-die process variations, which have a direct impact on realized circuit performance manifested as significantly reduced yields of fabricated fully operational SoC. The core goal of the HEALICs program is to regain this lost performance. Additionally, the technology developed under this program is expected to address environmental variations and aging as well. Consequently, the long-term reliability of DoD electronic systems is expected to be significantly enhanced.

A key benefit of these new devices is that they can be integrated into very compact circuits and assemblies that will provide dramatic advances to the power bus of a platform. Specifically, this program will develop the technology to enable DC to DC power conversion for military applications at the scale of an integrated circuit so it can be embedded within the electronics subsystem and a new distributed power architecture can be realized. The focus of this program is on attaining 100MHz internal operation frequencies of power circuits since the size of the passive elements (inductors and capacitors) in a power converter scales as the fourth power of the internal operating frequency. FY 2010 Plans: - Complete design and initial fabrication of critical sub-circuits and perform measurements in laboratory. - Complete theoretical design and analyses for understanding of the high-frequency trade-off space of relevant circuit designs and topologies. Highly Linear Ultra-low Power RF-FETs using CNTs (ULP-LINFET) (U) The objective of the Highly Linear Ultra-low Power RF-FETs using CNTs (ULP-LINFET) program is to develop radio frequency (RF) field effect transistors (FET) using a layer of 1-Dimensional (1-D) aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the conduction channel to achieve high linearity and ultra-low power for defense sensor systems. CNTs, due to their one-dimensional physics and high current carrying capacity, offer the unique opportunity to achieve highly-linear, high-frequency, and ultra-low power in FET devices. Linearity of RF devices is extremely important in signal rich environments such as noisy battlefields with extensive jamming. Highly linear low noise amplifiers are critical for applications such as: RF front-end processing, broad-band digital communication, radar, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), electronic and signal intelligence (ELINT, SIGINT), electronic sensing (ESM), electronic warfare (EW) and other sensor systems employed in surveillance and reconnaissance C4ISR systems.

Integrated Sensor is Structure (ISIS) (U) The Integrated Sensor is Structure (ISIS) program is developing a sensor of unprecedented proportions that is fully integrated into a stratospheric airship that will address the nation's need for persistent wide-area surveillance, tracking, and engagement for hundreds of time-critical air and ground targets in urban and rural environments. ISIS is achieving radical sensor improvements by melding the next-generation technologies for enormous lightweight antenna apertures and high-energy density components into a highly-integrated lightweight multi-purpose airship structure - completely erasing the distinction between payload and platform. The ISIS concept includes ninety-nine percent on-station 24/7/365 availability for Simultaneous Airborne Moving Target Indicator (AMTI) (600 kilometers) and Ground-Based Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) (300 kilometers) operation; ten years of autonomous, unmanned flight; hundreds of wideband in-theater covert communications links; responsive reconstitution of failed space assets; plus CONUS-based sensor analysis and operation.

Deep View (U) The Deep View program goal was to develop a high-resolution radar imaging capability to characterize objects in earth orbit, with special emphasis placed on imaging small objects at orbits ranging from low earth orbit to geosynchronous orbit. The approach was based upon a large aperture imaging radar system redesigned to operate at very high power over very broad bandwidth at W-band. Key technology development focused on: 1) transmitters capable of providing the required power to image at deep-space ranges over full bandwidth, and 2) an antenna design that maintains the necessary form factor over a very large aperture. The program concluded following completion of a power combining test of three gyro- twystron tubes in a single sub-band. The Deep View technologies have transitioned to the Air Force.

Falcon (U) The Falcon program objectives are to develop and demonstrate hypersonic technologies that will enable prompt global reach missions. The technologies include high lift-to-drag techniques, high temperature materials, precision navigation, guidance, and control, communications through plasma, and an autonomous flight safety system. Leveraging technology developed under the Hypersonic Flight (HyFly) program, Falcon will address the implications of hypersonic flight and reusability using a series of hypersonic technology vehicles (HTVs) to incrementally demonstrate these required technologies in flight. The HTV-2 program will demonstrate enabling hypersonic technologies for future operational systems through rocket-boosted hypersonic flights with sufficient cross-range and downrange performance to evaluate thermal protection systems, aerodynamic shapes, maneuverability, and long- range communication for hypersonic cruise and re-entry vehicle applications. Technologies developed under Falcon would also allow for a low cost, responsive Small Launch Vehicle (SLV) capable of launching small satellites into low earth and sun synchronous orbits and will provide the nation a new, small payload access to space capability. The Falcon program addresses many high priority mission areas and applications such as global presence and space lift. DARPA established a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Air Force for the HTV-2 program in May 2003 and with NASA in October 2004. The effort has been jointly funded with the Office of Secretary of Defense Global Strike program office in FY 2008 and FY 2009. Falcon capabilities are planned for transition to the Air Force in FY 2010.

Satellite Program for Instant Depletion of Energetic Radiation (SPIDER)* *Formerly Sleight of HAND (SOH). (U) The effects of High Altitude Nuclear Detonations (HAND) are catastrophic to satellites. HAND- generated charged particles are trapped for very long periods of time, possibly for years, oscillating between the earth's north and south magnetic poles. This enhanced radiation environment would immediately degrade low earth orbiting (LEO) spacecraft capability and result in their destruction within a few weeks. The Satellite Program for Instant Depletion of Energetic Radiation (SPIDER) is a proof-of- concept demonstration of the technology and techniques to rapidly mitigate the HAND-enhanced trapped radiation within days of a HAND event, before LEO spacecraft capabilities are degraded. Other proposed remediation methods are slower, taking weeks or months versus days, and would result in spacecraft degradation and would require asset replacement. The SPIDER program will use a satellite-based neutral gas release to generate plasma waves over a large region of the trapped radiation belts. Trapped electrons will experience plasma wave induced accelerations and pitch angle scattering. Pitch angle scattering causes the harmful electrons to be precipitated out of the radiation belt and neutralized in the earth's atmosphere. Complementary efforts will include the development of an end-to-end model and the development of techniques to measure and probe the state of the ionosphere, particularly the population density of trapped high energy electrons. Following modeling and analysis, laboratory proof-of-concept experiments and a risk reduction sounding rocket flight, a space-based demonstration will be pursued as a pathfinder for a future program to develop an operational radiation belt remediation capability. Potential transition partners include the Navy and Air Force. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Performed detailed modeling and analysis of neutral gas release approach to determine the potential efficiency of the high energy electron remediation process. - Used results of ground-based SPIDER experiments to enhance requirements for a space-based SPIDER demonstrator.12.710 17.000 31.800 283UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #31 Page 10 of 20Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603287E SPACE PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NUMBER B. in 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2009 Plans: - Develop conceptual design for the on-orbit space demonstration. - Prepare for risk reduction sounding rocket flight.

RAD Hard by Design (U) This program is developing, characterizing, and demonstrating microelectronic design technologies to enable fabrication of radiation hardened electronic components using leading-edge, commercial fabrication facilities. The current mainstream approach for fabricating radiation-hardened electronics depends on specialized process technologies and dedicated foundries that serve this military market niche. While commercial semiconductor fabrication is not explicitly radiation hardened, recent trends in deeply scaled fabrication such as very thin oxides, trench isolation, and multiple levels of metal are resulting in semiconductor devices that are inherently more tolerant of radiation than older generations. This program is pursuing development of design-based technologies that will enable pure commercial fabrication technologies to attain radiation hardened electronics equivalent to those from the dedicated foundries. The design technology developed under the Radiation Hardening by Design (RHBD) program is planned for transition to the Air Force and to the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) at the end of Phase II, which is anticipated to be completed by FY 2009. Specific design libraries for hardened circuits will transition through the defense electronics design industry, which are being supported largely by DTRA and the Air Force.

Microsatellite Demonstration Science and Technology Experiment Program (MiDSTEP) (U) The Microsatellite Demonstration Science and Technology Experiment Program (MiDSTEP) will develop advanced technologies, capabilities, and space environment characterization required to demonstrate a suite of advanced lightweight microsatellite technologies integrated into high performance microsatellites across the continuum from low earth orbit (LEO) to deep space super geosynchronous orbit (GEO) environments. The program will integrate a variety of advanced technologies, which have not been previously flight-tested, and may include: lightweight optical space surveillance/situational awareness sensors, lightweight power, chemical and electric propulsion systems, advanced lightweight structures, advanced miniature RF technology including micro crosslink and use of COTS approaches, active RF sensor technology, COTS processor and software environment, miniature navigation technologies, including the use of starfields for deep space navigation, and autonomous operations. The developed capabilities will include high thrust, high efficiency solar thermal propulsion systems that can enable responsive orbit transfer as well as provide radiation resistant high-density electrical power. The program will also explore ultra-stable payload isolation and pointing systems and components to enable advanced miniature communication systems. In addition, the program will also consider affordable, responsive fabrication and integration approaches and the possibility of networking microsatellites/modules to create a flexible architecture of assets responsive to multiple missions and threats.

FY 2010 Plans: - Design and develop microsatellite system concepts and integrate selected technologies. - Perform component and subsystem ground tests. System F6 (U) The goal of the System F6 program is to demonstrate a radically new space system composed of a heterogeneous network of free flying or loosely connected small satellite modules that will, working together, provide at least the same effective mission capability of a large monolithic satellite. Current large space systems used for national security purposes are constrained due to their monolithic architecture. They can be launched only on a small number of large launch vehicles, cannot readily be upgraded and/ or reconfigured with new hardware on-orbit, and are risk-intensive, since the unforgiving launch and space environments can result in a total loss of investment with one mistake. The System F6 will partition the tasks performed by monolithic spacecraft (high bandwidth communications downlink, information processing, data storage, navigation, power, etc.) and assign each task to a dedicated small or micro satellite. This new fractionated space system architecture offers the potential for reduced risk, greater flexibility (e.g., on-orbit maintainability, scalability, adaptability, evolvability), enhanced robustness (e.g. survivability to attack, decreased mission impact due to launch vehicle failures), payload isolation, and faster deployment of initial capability. This program will develop, design, and test new space system architectures and technologies required to successfully decompose a conventional spacecraft into fundamental elements.

Existing GEO spacecraft are outfitted with sufficient propellant to provide for needed station keeping, repositioning, and retirement maneuvers, which in many cases defines their useful mission durations. Once this propellant is expended, the vehicle is retired and, in many cases replaced. FREND technologies can enable significant service extension to these spacecraft through re-boosting near end-of-life. Recent events have significantly increased the number of objects in low earth orbit (LEO), particularly in orbital planes of most interest to DoD users, causing an increased threat to safe space operations. FREND combines detailed photogrammetric and laser imaging with robotic multi-degree-of-freedom manipulators to autonomously grapple space objects not outfitted with custom interfaces. A FREND-based servicing spacecraft offers the potential for spacecraft salvage, repair, rescue, reposition, de-orbit and retirement, and debris removal. The program will examine possible solutions for all classes of LEO debris to determine the most economical technical solution set to mitigating the problem. In addition, FREND will investigate neurorobotics as a potential replacement for the baseline suite of algorithms (e.g., arm trajectory planning, vehicle pose estimation, grapple feature identification, or compliance control) required to dock multiple robotic arms with a client spacecraft. The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Procured and fabricated flight hardware for integration and testing. - Conducted robotic payload ground test. - Tested control schemes in 1G (earth's gravity) environment. - Conducted hardware-in-the-loop testing of flight hardware in proximity operations test facility. - Assessed applicability of neurorobotic technologies to the FREND robotic payload.

FY 2010 Plans: - Demonstrate application of neurorobotic technology to FREND payload in \"earth's gravity\" environment. - Initiate a preliminary design of the FREND based servicing spacecraft. - Initiate studies of LEO debris solutions. Fast Access Spacecraft Testbed (FAST) (U) The goal of the Fast Access Spacecraft Testbed (FAST) program is to demonstrate a suite of critical technologies including high efficiency solar cells, sunlight concentrating arrays, large deployable structures and ultra light weight solar arrays. These technologies enable light weight, high efficiency and high-power satellites, 20kW scalable to 80kW or more. The specific power goal is 130 W/Kg yielding an ultra light- weight power system of approximately 150 Kg for a 20kW array. Combined with electric propulsion, FAST enables fast-transfer roaming satellites with nearly five times the fuel efficiency of conventional chemical propulsion. For example, FAST will permit on-demand access to any point on the geosynchronous ring or within the high-altitude, super synchronous \"graveyard\" (where derelict systems are regularly repositioned in order to free up orbital slots within the ring), greatly improving our ability to rapidly deploy and reposition satellites, as well as monitor the geosynchronous environment. Alternatively, FAST will permit responsive launch capabilities including deployment of small geosynchronous satellites on small launch vehicles. Scaled up systems will nearly double the effective satellite mass launched to high altitude orbits today, significantly downsizing the need for large launch vehicles. The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force.

FY 2010 Plans: - Integrate FAST high-power generation subsystem with demonstrator spacecraft. NanoPayload Delivery (NPD) (U) The NanoPayload Delivery (NPD) program studied the technical feasibility of ultra-lightweight, rapid- response spacecraft delivery from land, sea, or air-based platforms. Such nanopayloads (1-10 kilograms) could be boosted to low earth orbit (200 km altitude) in a matter of hours following call-up. The program examined the use of ongoing technology development efforts, which permit the fabrication of microscale pumps, thrust chambers, and valves. Such rocket engines, which are theoretically capable of thrust- to-weight ratios of 100:1 or greater, would allow for significant reductions in overall engine mass and permit nanosatellites to be placed in low orbits for several weeks to months. Delivery systems considered included: (1) a stock aircraft, such as the F-15E or F-16, (2) a truck-mounted erector, or (3) the deck of a small naval vessel. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Surveyed existing aircraft-, land-, and sea-based missile platforms for compatibility with NPD mission constraints and requirements. - Designed, fabricated, and tested a micro chemical engine; including pumps, lines, valves, and thrust chamber to validate performance models.2.966 .000 .000 Space Situational Awareness (SSA) & Counterspace Operations Response Environment (SCORE) (U) The goal of the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) & Counterspace Operations Response Environment (SCORE) program is to develop and demonstrate an operational framework and responsive4.000 4.800 10.000 290UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #31 Page 17 of 20Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603287E SPACE PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NUMBER B. in Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 defense application to enhance the availability of vulnerable commercial space-based communications resources. SCORE will correlate a wide range of operational support and space system ground user data to rapidly identify threat activities, propose mitigating countermeasures, and verify the effectiveness of selected responses. Critical technologies include accessing disparate sources of relevant data, model- based situational awareness, and candidate response generation and evaluation. Particular emphasis will be placed on the ability to continuously adapt to changes in defended system components and usage patterns as well as validation of SCORE system integrity. The potential transition customer is the Air Force. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Developed initial system requirements and design. - Developed list of applicable systems and identified relevant sources of data. FY 2009 Plans: - Conduct system trades and validate critical components. - Mature system parameters and operational procedures. FY 2010 Plans: - Develop algorithms and software required to integrate disparate information into a single framework. - Integrate software environment into a suite of visualization products that provide situational awareness and decision making tools. MEO Synthetic Aperture Radar (MEOSAR) (U) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) integration time is currently limited by the amount of ground vehicle motion encountered during the synthetic aperture collection time. For space radar systems, this has traditionally meant that SAR had to be accomplished at low earth orbit (LEO) trajectories where the collection time would be much shorter given the high speeds of a LEO satellite. Although the specifics depend heavily on geometric considerations, medium earth orbit (MEO) SAR imaging intervals can be a factor of approximately eight longer, compared to a LEO alternative. The longer integration times required at MEO can have a major impact on the quality of the otherwise equivalent SAR image due.000 1.750 4.000 291UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #31 Page 18 of 20Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603287E SPACE PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NUMBER B. in Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 to the presence of internal motion within the image scene. To achieve equivalent quality imagery, the contribution of the moving targets within the image must be excised. The MEO Synthetic Aperture Radar (MEOSAR) program will develop techniques to identify moving targets and extract them from the data prior to imaging to avoid the streaking caused by their motions. The program will develop reliable automated detection of moving targets within SAR imagery using a double thresholding process in interferometric phase and amplitude. This moving target detection technique can be readily reversed to excise the moving targets from the clutter (image) background. Temporal sub-array processing will demonstrate early detection and rejection of moving targets in sub-array images. The program will develop improved motion detection and removal algorithms, demonstrate their performance on simulated and airborne data, and develop an architectural concept for a MEOSAR system. The developed technology will be transitioned to the Air Force. FY 2009 Plans: - Perform compact test range demonstration validating system concept and algorithms. - Complete design for a potential flight demonstration system. FY 2010 Plans: - Initiate final design plans for the flight demonstration system. - Complete subsystem technologies. Bi-Static Shield (U) The Bi-Static Shield program will utilize existing satellite tracking, telemetry and control (TT&C) antennas from NASA's Goldstone tracking site to illuminate geosynchronous (GEO) satellites. Using ground-based radio astronomy antennas located across the country to serve as bi-static receivers, reflections from small GEO intruder satellites will be processed to form 3-D images, useful for determining their function and threat potential. Use of existing satellite transmit antennas to generate a bi-static electromagnetic shield would demonstrate the utility of very important situational awareness capability without the need for additional on-orbit assets around individual satellites. The Bi-Static Shield program is planned for transition to the Air Force for space situational awareness applications..000 3.500 2.000 292UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #31 Page 19 of 20Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603287E SPACE PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NUMBER B. in 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2009 Plans: - Conduct modeling and simulation to determine algorithms required. - Assess availability of ground and space-based objects for concept demonstration. - Conduct proof-of-principle demonstrations of basic concept.

High Delta-V Experiment (HiDVE) (U) The goal of the High Delta-V Experiment (HiDVE) program is to design, develop, and demonstrate a low-mass, low-volume, high delta-V solar thermal propulsion (STP) engine suitable for integration with approximately a 15kg nanosatellite host. The enabling technologies are very high-temperature materials and light-weight solar concentration systems. A HiDVE system will provide small satellites, historically constructed without propulsive capability, with substantial delta-V affording nanosatellites increased orbital range, in terms of both altitude and plane. In addition, this flexibility will be essential to future nanosatellite mission designers and operators, who will be able to take advantage of less-than-optimal insertion orbits and later move to an intended mission orbit. Specific objectives of the HiDVE program include: development and demonstration of a functioning STP system in a relevant environment; an operational test plan that outlines the steps needed to flight-qualify an integrated nanosatellite with an STP system. The Air Force is the expected transition partner. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Developed a functioning high delta-V solar thermal propulsion system design for relevant environments.

Such structures autonomously deployed, assembled or manufactured on orbit can support a wide range of future military applications ranging from revolutionary intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and communications to high power energy generation.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) The MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) program is a broad, cross-disciplinary initiative to merge computation and power generation with sensing and actuation to realize a new technology for both perceiving and controlling weapons systems and battlefield environments. Using fabrication processes and materials similar to those used to make microelectronic devices, MEMS applies the advantages of miniaturization, multiple components and integrated microelectronics to the design and construction of integrated electromechanical and electro-chemical-mechanical systems. The MEMS program addresses issues ranging from the scaling of devices and physical forces to new organization and control strategies for distributed, high-density arrays of sensor and actuator elements. These issues include microscale power and actuation systems as well as microscale components that survive harsh environments. The microfluidic molecular systems program will develop automated microsystems that integrate biochemical fluid handling capability along with electronics, optoelectronics and chip-based reaction and detection modules to perform tailored analysis sequences to monitor environmental conditions, health hazards and physiological states. (U) The MEMS program has three principal objectives: the realization of advanced devices and systems concepts; the development and insertion of MEMS into DoD systems; and the creation of support and access technologies to catalyze a MEMS technology infrastructure. These three objectives cut across a number of focus application areas to create revolutionary military capabilities, make high-end functionality affordable to low-end systems and extend the operational performance and lifetimes of existing weapons platforms. The major technical focus areas for the MEMS program are: 1) inertial measurement; 2) fluid sensing and control; 3) electromagnetic and optical beam steering; 4) mass data storage; 5) chemical reactions on chip; 6) electromechanical signal processing; 7) active structural control; 8) analytical instruments; and 9) distributed networks of sensors and actuators.

Micromechanical RF switches are of particular interest,5.378 4.983 1.322 299UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #46 Page 6 of 40Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603739E ADVANCED ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGIESPROJECT NUMBER Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 where sizable power throughputs and impacting operation constitute harsh operational environments. Other applications such as vibrating resonator reference tanks, gyroscopes, and accelerometers are also of interest. Among the HERMIT implementation approaches deemed likely to succeed, two are of the most interest: 1) wafer-level encapsulation or packaging strategies based on MicroElectroMechanical systems (MEMS) technology that isolates a micromechanical device from its surroundings while maintaining a desired environment via passive or active control; or 2) material and design engineering strategies that render a micromechanical device impervious to its environment with or without a package (if possible). A key approach in this program that should allow orders of magnitude power savings is to selectively control only the needed micro-scale environment or volume via MEMS-enabled isolation technologies. The success of this program should enable a myriad of strategic capabilities including lower cost, more complex phased array antennas for radar applications; tiny frequency references with long- and short-term stabilities that greatly extend the portability of ultra-secure communications; micro-scale inertial measurement units with bias stabilities approaching navigation-grade. The HERMIT program is anticipated to transition via industry to phased array antenna, reconfigurable communication front-end, seeker, and steerable aperture programs being developed by the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as to inertial navigation systems and Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) communications needed by these Services. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Demonstrated essential elements (e.g., thermistors, heaters, getters) needed for low power control of the operating environment surrounding a micromechanical device. FY 2009 Plans: - Demonstrate micromechanical devices (e.g., RF switches, vibrating resonators) fully integrated together with environment isolating measures (including circuits, if any) that maintain unprecedented performance, stability, and reliability, even under harsh environments. - Demonstrate high yield MEMS RF switching component technologies that result in test devices that can operate for at least 100 billion switching cycles. Yield goals are to attain a 95% confidence that 99% of tested devices will meet 100 billion cycles. - Implement parallel measurement set-up to increase test throughput. 300UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #46 Page 7 of 40Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603739E ADVANCED ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGIESPROJECT NUMBER Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 - Initiate efforts for demonstrating the performance of RF switches in relevant radar applications.

MEMS Exchange (U) The MEMS Exchange program seeks to provide flexible access to complex MicroElectroMechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication technology in a wide variety of materials and to a broad, multi-disciplinary user base via the MEMS Exchange service. A major goal of the effort is to ensure self-sustained operation of MEMS Exchange after the end of the program by adding several process modules to the existing repertoire and increasing the number of processes run per year to raise revenues to the point of self- sufficiency. Among the future payoffs of this program is the establishment of an accessible infrastructure for low or medium volume production of MEMS-enabled products for DoD applications. The goal of the MEMS Exchange program is to provide MEMS fabrication services to all levels of industry and academia in support of Army, Navy, Air Force, and other DoD requirements without further DARPA sponsorship. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Doubled the number of runs processed per year to achieve a goal rate of 500 runs per year. - Provided a modular merging process that combines modules together with transistor integrated circuits.

The key approach in this program that should allow orders of magnitude power savings is to selectively cool only the needed volume/device via MEMS- enabled isolation technologies. Such an approach will benefit a large number of applications where performance is determined predominately by only a few devices in a system, e.g., communications where the front-end filter and LNA often set the noise figure; and sensors, where the transducer and input transistor in the sense amplifier often set the resolution.

Integrated Primary Atomic Clock (IMPACT)* *Formerly titled Micro-Beam Clock. (U) The Integrated Primary Atomic Clock (IMPACT) program will extend the accuracy of Chip Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC) by exploiting the precision of nuclear particle transport. The concept of beam clock has been known at least since the 1960's but has not been widely pursued due to the difficulty in containing a large volume of xenon gas. This problem will be addressed by going to the micro-scale. Miniaturization of the conventional beam clocks with major innovations are possible due to microscale implementation - microscale xenon atom source, micromachined permanent magnets, and micromechanical atom flux detectors. This approach will not only improve the stability over existing CSAC but will further reduce the required power. This technology will be transitioned into DoD systems through innovative companies, including performers under the Chip-Scale Atomic Clock program.

Nano-Electro-Mechanical Computers (NEMS) (U) The goal of the Nano-Electro-Mechanical Computers (NEMS) program is to develop nanoscale mechanical switches and gain elements integrated intimately with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor switches. One mechanical switch per transistor will enable the transistor to operate at near zero leakage powers, enabling pico or femtowatt standby operation. The program will also develop mechanical gain elements using physical effects such as giant magnetoresistance, buckling, electromechanical phase transitions, van der Waals forces, and Casimir forces to enable very low- noise, high-frequency amplifiers for low-power, low-noise analog signal processing. Possibilities of using mechanical power supplies and mechanical vibrating clocks could enable electronics that are less susceptible to electromagnetic pulse attacks.

Information Tethered Microscale Autonomous Rotary Stages (ITMARS)* *Formerly titled NanoCAD. (U) Early MEMS work had demonstrated many ways of realizing rotating micromotors, and in fact had been the source of major popular interest in the field of micromachines. However, the unique capability to precisely rotate micromachined structures in a controllable manner has been under-utilized in MEMS systems. Although the use in micromotors for optical and mechanical switches has been demonstrated, most applications passively use the structures fabricated into the rotary stage. To date there is no technology able to transmit power and signals to these tiny stages from the substrate on which they are rotating. This program will explore ways at pushing the envelope by engineering ways of coupling power and signals to a rotating MEMS stage, and measuring its position with much higher accuracy then possible at the macroscale. With this capability, arrays of rotating 100-1000 micron diameter stages could carry various sensors that can be aimed at any azimuth and inclination, and can be rotated 360 degrees for cancelling angle dependent biases. Examples of sensors that might utilize this capability include microphones, antennas, radiation sensors, etc. Although many of these sensors exist, by adding the rotating stage functionality without increase in sensor/system size, weight, and power, one can really see the benefit of integrating MEMS with traditional sensors. The program will transition via industry performers. FY 2009 Plans: - Initiate efforts to implement power and information to microscale rotating stages, for various applications.

FY 2010 Plans: - Improve rejection of unwanted signals while minimizing impedance. - Match resonators to analog-to-digital converters. Chip-Scale Vacuum Micropumps (U) The ability to efficiently distribute fluids throughout certain types of microsystems and to provide on- chip vacuum capabilities for various technologies is critical to the performance of many microsystems, including micro mass spectrometers, nanoscale detectors, RF resonators, and vacuum microelectronic components. Although microscale pumps have been developed by a number of research groups, many microsystems currently employ off-chip pumping because available microscale pumps cannot meet stressing application requirements. There is a pressing need for chip-scale micropumps with significantly improved performance (capable of operating at ~10^-6 Torr in a volume smaller than 1 CM^3). The MEMS Micropumps program will develop high-performance pumping capabilities critical to achieving an integrated, low-power microscale total analysis system and other complex electronic devices.

FY 2010 Plans: - Employ metrology data to predict device performance using nanoscale Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools, and apply tuning to achieve homogeneous. Nano Thermal Interfaces (NTI) (U) The primary goal of the Nano Thermal Interfaces (NTI) program is the development and demonstration of new technologies and concepts based on exploitation of novel materials and structures that provide significant reduction in the thermal resistance of the interface layer between the backside of an electronic device (chip) and the next layer of packaging. This interface is where considerable waste heat is dissipated and leads to thermal limitations in many electronic components. The NTI program will develop new materials and associated processes to serve as enhanced thermal interfaces that can provide consistent, reliable and stable thermal resistance throughout the life of DoD electronic systems. Materials with highly directional thermal properties and matched thermal coefficients will be investigated and utilized. Program transition will occur through industrial performers.

FY 2010 Plans: - Design and build modules with all interfaces that demonstrate ACM benefits. - Reduce junction temperature for electronic devices. Chip-Scale Micro Gas Analyzers (U) The Chip-Scale Micro Gas Analyzers program utilized the latest microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technologies to implement separation-based analyzers (e.g., gas chromatographs, mass spectrometers, poly-chromator-like devices) at the micro-scale to greatly enhance the selectivity of sensors to specific species, and thus, enable extremely reliable, remote detection of chemical/biological agents. The use of MEMS technology also increased analysis speed and made possible the operation of such complex analyzer systems at extremely low power levels-perhaps low enough for operation as autonomous, wireless sensors. The many challenges faced in this program included the exploration and realization of micro-scale preconcentrator approaches, stacked gas columns, multiple sensor arrays, ionizers, vacuum pumps, and vacuum packaging. The success of this program yielded sensors substantially more selective than conventional sensors, again, making them particularly suitable for detection and identification of airborne toxins. The Chip-Scale Gas Analyzers program is transitioning via industry to Chemical Warfare Agents (CWA) detector programs being developed by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command (SBCCOM).

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) The goal of the Mixed Technology Integration project is to leverage advanced microelectronics manufacturing infrastructure and DARPA component technologies developed in other projects to produce mixed-technology microsystems. These 'wristwatch size', low-cost, lightweight and low power microsystems will improve the battlefield awareness, security of the warfighter and the operational performance of military platforms. At the present time, systems are fabricated by assembling a number of mixed-technology components: microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microphotonics, microfluidics and millimeterwave/microwave. Each technology usually requires a different level of integration, occupies a separate silicon chip and requires off-chip wiring, and requires fastening and packaging to form a module. The chip assembly and packaging processes produce a high cost, high power, large volume and lower performance system. This program is focused on the monolithic integration of mixed technologies to form batch-fabricated, mixed technology microsystems 'on-a-single-chip' or an integrated and interconnected 'stack-of-chips'. (U) The field of microelectronics incorporates micrometer/nanometer scale integration and is the most highly integrated, low-cost and high-impact technology to date. Microelectronics technology has produced the microcomputer-chip that enabled or supported the revolutions in computers, networking and communication. This program extends the microelectronics paradigm to include the integration of heterogeneous or mixed technologies. This new paradigm will create a new class of 'matchbook-size', highly integrated device and microsystem architectures. Examples of component-microsystems include low-power, small-volume, lightweight, microsensors, microrobots and microcommunication systems that will improve and expand the performance of the warfighter, military platforms, munitions and Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs). (U) The program includes the integration of mixed materials on generic substrates including glass, polymers and silicon. The program is design and process intensive, using 'standard' processes and developing new semiconductor-like processes and technologies that support the integration of mixed-technologies at the micrometer/ nanometer scale. The program includes the development of micrometer/nanometer scale isolation, contacts, interconnects and 'multiple-chip-scale' packaging for electronic, mechanical, fluidic, photonic and rf/mmwave/microwave technologies. example, a mixed-technology microsystem using integrated microfluidics, MEMS, microphotonics, microelectronics and microwave components could provide a highly integrated, portable analytical instrument to monitor the battlefield environment, the physical condition of a warfighter, the identity of warfighters (friend or foe) or the combat readiness of equipment. The ability to integrate mixed technologies onto a single substrate will drive down the size, weight, volume, and cost of weapon systems while increasing their performance and reliability. 312UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #46 Page 19 of 40Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603739E ADVANCED ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGIESPROJECT NUMBER Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 Adaptive Photonic Phased Locked Elements (APPLE) (U) The goal of the Adaptive Photonic Phased Locked Elements (APPLE) program is to demonstrate a fully scalable and modular architecture of phased sub-apertures capable of producing an arbitrarily large optical aperture that can be rapidly and non-mechanically steered over a wide field of regard with high precision. This effort is anticipated to transition via industry for potential laser systems and space based applications. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Demonstrated the controlled combining of the outputs of multiple (7) small individual apertures at low input powers. - Demonstrated a small single aperture that could handle a high level of input laser power (200 Watts).

However, as the underlying bit rates of the optical networks are pushed beyond 40 giga-bits per second there will be significant processing bottlenecks in these networks and these bottlenecks will severely limit the military's ability to rapidly transport time critical information. A potential solution to this problem is to develop photonic technology so optics can take over higher order network processing functions. The Data in Optical Domain Network (DoD-Network) program will develop and demonstrate four key photonic technologies to meet these challenges: all-optical routing, all-optical data buffering (controllable and eventually random access), optical logic and circuits, and all-optical (multi-wavelength) regenerators. These photonic technologies will lead to intelligent all-optical networks.

High Operating Temperature - Mid-Wave Infrared (HOT MWIR) (U) The objective of the High Operating Temperature - Mid-Wave Infrared (HOT MWIR) program is to establish technology for high-speed sampling and high-spatial resolution infrared focal plane arrays that operate in the mid-wave infrared without cryogenic cooling. The high sampling speed is required for both threat detection and for imaging from fast moving platforms. Technology goals are to achieve greater than an order of magnitude reduction in currents contributing to detector noise demonstrated with a high density, large area detector array format of up to 1280 x 720 elements.

Recent innovations in solid state imaging devices, including parallel processing at the pixel level and novel read read-out technology, can contribute to development of a new class of sensors, which can create an image with only a few photons per pixel, exceeding performance of current low light level imagers.

Electronic & Photonic Integrated Circuits on Silicon (EPIC) (U) The Electronic & Photonic Integrated Circuits on Silicon (EPIC) program will develop two critical alternative photonic technologies based on silicon substrates. The first thrust addresses active photonic components based on silicon, which do not rely on generating light within the material. While passive photonic components, such as waveguides, can be fabricated from silicon, silicon's indirect bandgap does not lend itself to fabricating active photonic components based on the generation of photons (lasers, amplifiers etc.). The first alternative technology development will be optical amplifiers using Raman gain. Fiber amplifiers based on Raman gain currently play a major role in optical networks, and demonstrating this optical amplification in silicon will be a major step toward overcoming on-chip losses in complex chip- scale optical components. The second alternative technology development will address optical transistor action, or switching, in silicon (i.e., a three-terminal optical device in which control photons at one terminal will make a large change in the photons transmitted between the other two terminals). Taken together, these two capabilities will create a new paradigm in which silicon will provide a platform for monolithic integration of photonic and electronic functions. The EPIC program is anticipated to transition via industry to optical communication and electronic warfare programs of interest to all Services.

Nyquist-Limited Infrared Detectors (NIRD)* *Formerly High Resolution Short Wave Infrared/High Density Infrared Retina. (U) The Nyquist-Limited Infrared Detectors (NIRD) program develops high density, long-wave infrared (LWIR) arrays and signal processing to improve capability to image through scattering media such as dust and sand, known as brownout, fog, snow storms, and to enhance situational awareness needed for aircraft navigation. The LWIR provides advantages in imaging through the dust clouds created in helicopter landing especially in desert areas. This obscurant penetration capability of LWIR imaging can be significantly improved when the pixel size is reduced to preserve high frequency information, while at the same time, a practical size optical aperture is maintained with approximately F/1 optics. The obscurant penetration capability of the LWIR focal plane array (FPA) can be further enhanced with signal and imaging processing. The low frequency pedestal in the image caused by the obscurant must be reduced to increase image contrast and the effective dynamic range. The small pixel FPA presents unique challenges in detector design and fabrication and in the interconnection of the detector array to the read-out integrated circuit (ROIC). The origin of noise currents in the detector must be understood and characterized, especially the role of surface currents in the small pixel devices. The method of interconnection must be compatible with large arrays of small pixel elements, achieve a low contact resistance, and reliably interconnect at each pixel across the array.

Disruptive Manufacturing Technologies (DMT) (U) The goal of the Disruptive Manufacturing Technologies (DMT) program is to achieve significant and pervasive cost savings, and/or decreases in cycle time, for existing or planned procurements. There has been a long-standing desire to replace traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs), which are pervasive in nearly all electronic warfare (EW), information warfare (IW), radar, and communication systems with lower cost solid-state components. The DMT program will merge Polystrata (Registered Trademark) and GaN technologies to eliminate the need for monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs). The direct product replacement transition candidate for this program is the TWTA power amplifier output stage in the AN/ALE-55 Fiber Optic Towed Decoy for the Navy's new F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet, and the Air Force B1-B and F-15 platforms. It will be replaced with solid-state hybrid microwave integrate circuit (HyMIC) modules developed by merging Polystrata and gallium nitride (GaN) technologies. The result will be a 10x reduction in TWTA cost for the Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures (IDECM) program, a joint Navy-Air Force program. Beyond developing a replacement for TWTAs, HyMIC technology promises to increase adoption of high performance millimeter wave (MMW) systems employing mature III-V technologies as well as advance earlier adoption of those using nascent III-V technologies.

Moore's law has driven the silicon industry for several decades with the minimum feature size on an integrated circuit (IC) reduced to 45 nm for today's commercial products. Due to challenging patterning requirements and complex circuit designs, costs of lithography tools and masks have become unaffordable for low-volume manufacture, i.e., military electronics or application specific integrated circuit (ASICs). Similarly, the circuit design, verification, and testing costs have also grown exponentially further preventing military electronics from using advanced silicon technology nodes. Military electronics capabilities are currently limited by the high cost of nanofabrication. To solve this important problem, DARPA has invested in a variety of maskless patterning technologies including parallel e-beam arrays, parallel scanning probe arrays, and an innovative e-beam lithography tool. This program will develop revolutionary circuit design methodologies coupled with innovative hybrid maskless patterning tools to realize cost-effective nanofabrication for low-volume defense or commercial ASICs.

Room Temperature Spintronics-Based Logic (Spin Logic) (U) The goal of the Room Temperature Spintronics-Based Logic (Spin Logic) program is to develop room temperature logic devices based on magnetic spin. In current logic devices, the ultimate speed is limited by the heat that can be removed from the chip. The current microchip technology has been shown to be highly optimized for efficiency and no significant decreases in energy per logic step are possible outside of those already on the technology roadmap. Devices based on magnetic spin would not be based on the movement of electrical charge and can therefore operate at a reduced energy cost per logic function while retaining the performance of the current technology. It is expected that the Spin Logic program will lead to both higher performance logic chips, and lower power electronics.

FY 2009 Plans: - Conduct feasibility study incorporating the results from the static runway measurements, outside data collection sources, and dynamic flight tests. - Develop requirements to support the development of a high resolution sensor pertinent to limited visibility flight operations. Photonic-enabled Simultaneous Transmit and Receive (P-STAR) (U) Information operation missions on multiple military platforms depend on the ability to transmit and receive radio frequency (RF) signals, simultaneously, from a single aperture. This program (a follow on to the Ultra-Wide Band Technology program) aims to develop transmit/receive modules with high transmit- to-receive isolation and low receive noise figures, over a multi-octave bandwidth, to greatly improve situational awareness of the RF environment, and enable greater control over the information domain. Furthermore, this program will help stem the proliferation of \"mission-specific\" antennas by providing an ultra-wide bandwidth antenna that can substitute for multiple custom antenna solutions. In addition to the increased functionality, the improved noise figure of the P-STAR technology will increase stand-off ranges and provide improved indications and warning. The program will transition via its industrial performers. FY 2009 Plans: - Fabricate and demonstrate a STAR module which exhibits high T/R isolation over a multi-octave frequency range.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) Military operations since the end of the Cold War illustrate that current theater-level command, control, communications, and intelligence/information systems lack the ability to fully support operations in complex, time-critical environments. Warfighters must be prepared for operations ranging from conflict and peacekeeping in urban centers to heavy battle actions in remote areas. Current capabilities do not provide the commander with real-time, secure, situational awareness or the ability to orchestrate high-tempo planning, rehearsal, and execution. The programs in this project are developing and testing innovative, secure architectures and tools to enhance information processing, dissemination, and presentation capabilities. The programs provide the commander insight into the disposition of enemy and friendly forces, a joint situational awareness picture that will improve planning, decision-making, and execution, secure multimedia information interfaces, and software assurance to the warfighter \"on the move\". Integration of collection management, planning, and battlefield awareness are essential elements for achieving battlefield dominance through assured information systems. B.

(U) The Heterogeneous Airborne Reconnaissance Team (HART) program develops integrated tactical planning and sensor management systems for heterogeneous collections of manned and unmanned platforms operating in urban environments. HART employs a model-based control architecture with dynamic teaming and platform-independent command and control. The system registers new platforms with the battle manager (kinematics, maneuverability, endurance, payloads, and communications links) to facilitate platform-independent tasking. HART provides a commander's interface that allows collaborative tasking of the platforms in the form of operational missions, such as search, track, identify, or engage, rather than routes and events. Additionally, it supplies computationally intensive decision aids, such as advanced 4-D airspace and groundspace deconfliction tools, route planners, and task/5.000 4.000 7.901 337UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #50 Page 4 of 35Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603760E COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMSPROJECT NUMBER CCC-01 B.

Deep Green* *Previously this was part of Advanced Tactical Battle Manager. (U) Deep Green is a next-generation battle command and decision support technology that interleaves anticipatory planning with adaptive execution to help the commander think ahead, identify when a plan is going awry, and prepare options before they are needed. Deep Green will radically reduce the time needed to plan and execute military operations and will reduce the number of staff officers needed in an operations center. Through rapid mission planning and execution and reduced staff overhead, Deep Green will save lives and reduce costs. Deep Green will automatically induce a plan and commander's intent from the commander's hand-drawn sketches with accompanying speech to facilitate rapid option creation. Deep Green generates a broad set of possible futures from those options for all sides in an operation and predicts the likelihood of each future. It supports anticipatory planning by using information about the ongoing operation to nominate future states that are no longer feasible and probable future states upon which the commander should focus additional planning efforts. By anticipating decision points early and allowing the commander to explore the future option space, Deep Green supports commander's visualization and adaptive execution, enabling correct, timely decisions by the commander.

The icons are geo-registered on the battlefield and viewed from each warfighter's perspective using a see-through head-mounted display. The system will enable the small unit leader to conduct non-line-of- sight combat operations using hands-free, iconic command and control while on the move. Information management protocols will support the dissemination of tactical information to allow the squad leader to hand-off actionable information and direct alerts to the squad/fire teams for real-time collaboration without overload. ULTRA-Vis will develop the key technologies that allow small unit leaders and members to selectively transmit critical combat information in the form of icons using existing, low-bandwidth soldier voice and data radios to covertly relay standard phrases and visual annotations. ULTRA-Vis empowers the small unit leader with a clear tactical advantage through inter/intra-squad collaboration, heightened situational awareness and the ability to take decisive action while on-the-move. The ULTRA-Vis prototype units are planned for transition to the U.S. Army, Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), and U.S. Marine Corps at the completion of the program in FY 2012.

Program ($ in Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 (U) The goal of the Collision Avoidance and Dynamic Airspace Control (CADAC) program is to maximize airspace utilization through dynamic military airspace management. Today's labor-intensive human centric airspace management processes result in an inefficient use of airspace, limit the density and responsiveness of airborne systems, and have a large forward footprint. Further, the introduction of unmanned aircraft has increasingly complicated the challenge, leading to operating constraints and a realized growing potential for mishaps related to the different characteristics of manned and unmanned systems. This program will evaluate and develop technologies for automated and distributed systems that efficiently manage all objects in the airspace to include munitions, manned and unmanned aircraft. Specifically focused on the needs of the military, the program will deliver provable levels of safety while ensuring military freedom of maneuver. The automated system will be developed as a replacement for current management systems and processes, and may also be employed locally to augment existing systems in complex mixed civil / military environments. It will seek to enable highly automated integration of multi-source information and control to support tightly coupled air/ground/surface operations centered on small-unit unconventional forces. Challenges to be addressed include trusted algorithms, networked information exchange with uncertainty, and integration of legacy, degraded and intentionally disruptive aircraft. The program will also explore novel concepts of operation enabled by radically enhanced airspace utilization. The capabilities developed by this program will benefit all of the Services. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Conducted multiple technology and feasibility analyses. - Developed and simulated candidate system architecture models. - Demonstrated the small Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) cooperative CADAC component concept. Advanced Tactical Battle Manager (U) The Advanced Tactical Battle Manager program develops automated decision support tools for Army and Marine Corps tactical commanders at the division level and below. The program also provides support for combined operations employing dismounted soldiers, manned platforms, and autonomous vehicles through a graphical interface with unit commanders and extends plans by applying adversarial reasoning techniques to identify vulnerabilities and opportunities in the predicted enemy course of action.2.000 3.000 6.500 342UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #50 Page 9 of 35Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603760E COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMSPROJECT NUMBER CCC-01 B.

(U) The Know What Is to Know Subsystem (KWIKS) develops a support tool that autonomously and continuously, during the execution of a military operation, tracks the state of what is known about the environment, and the forms and priorities of additional collection needs. This tool will provide automated assistance to the process of collections planning, which currently includes manual steps such as analysis of external context, enemy and neutral goals and capabilities, and assessment of known threats. It will support real-time planning of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) assets, leveraging outputs of automated exploitation capabilities. The overall benefit is more effective, rapid, complete identification of the enemy's state and responsive planning of limited collection assets, resulting in achieving mission objectives with fewer friendly casualties and lower collateral damage. (U) The Cognitive Design and Management for Agile C2 (CODe-MAC2) will develop integrated, in-theater tools for organizational design, cognitive resource configuration, and adaptive management of complex, often unconventional command and control (C2) structures. These tools will enable the U.S. military in real time to modify the responsibilities, relations, tasks, priorities, and information sharing to meet rapidly changing needs of the command across multiple units, echelons, and organizations, while shaping the choices of countries at strategic crossroads. U.S. forces increasingly encounter complex C2 structures that include Coalition forces (manned and unmanned), civilian agency resources, indigenous formal and informal powers, and non-governmental organizations. In response to the resulting challenges, the DoD has identified C2 as one of the areas where new, unconventional structures are needed to meet the new realities of today's operations and missions, and the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command has identified a critical gap in the technologies for agile configuration and analysis of C2 structures.

Increased Command and Control Effectiveness (ICE) (U) The Increased Command and Control Effectiveness (ICE) program develops and integrates cognitive systems technology into operational Command, Control, and Intelligence (C2I) systems. DARPA's Cognitive Systems programs have been developing the machine learning, reasoning, and human-machine dialogue technologies necessary to create cognitive assistants. This new technology promises to enable information systems to adapt automatically, during deployment and in real time, to the changing conditions that military commanders confront. This capability enables commanders to more rapidly adapt to evolving situations and priorities, and accelerates the incorporation of new personnel into command operations.

The resulting technologies can be extended and applied to a wide range of applications including ground vehicles, troop movements, and individual targets of interest as the methods of tracking those targets improves. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Demonstrated that individual and class-of-vessel motion-based activity patterns can be learned automatically from long-duration tracks. - Used learned patterns to predict future behavior and detect deviations from normal behavior. - Automatically processed deviation reports against a case base of known business behavior and prior deviations to filter out those that occur for good business reasons and alert on those that may pose a threat. - Demonstrated ability to drill down into historical patterns and supporting context information to support analysis of vessel behavior. - Installed initial system capability at operating naval site. - Participated in Trident Warrior 2008 at sea exercise.11.050 .000 .000 Joint Air/Ground Operations: Unified, Adaptive Replanning (JAGUAR) (U) The Joint Air/Ground Operations: Unified, Adaptive Replanning (JAGUAR) program improves battle management for complex air campaigns that employ new air platforms featuring precision sensors, weapons and communications relays. The JAGUAR system is driven by: 1) targeting information, both for sensor targets and strikes, expressed as point and area targets (i.e., search, combat air patrol); 2) rules of engagement and procedural constraints, such as airspace restrictions; and 3) availability of platforms, weapons, sensors, and communications equipment. From this information, JAGUAR produces ingress routes, flight schedules and patrol zones, while assuring airspace and electronic deconfliction.

Urban Commander (U) The Urban Commander program develops automated tools to help ground commanders construct detailed, realistic operational plans, particularly in nontraditional and urban environments. Partial plans are represented in hierarchical task networks and visualized through synchronization matrices, icon overlays, or tactical sketch animations. Commanders and staff modify, refine, and extend a plan through voice, sketching, and semi-structured input. The system links fragments constructed at different sites, transfers information among related parts, and discovers and recommends solutions for inconsistencies. The system continuously compiles a set of plan cases and employs analogical matching to propose extensions to current plans suggested by past experience. Plan elements are communicated through an integrated set of protocols from the unit commander down to dismount commanders equipped with advanced displays and sensors. Finally, the program continuously assesses progress against the operational plan and alerts users to significant deviations.

Predictive Battlespace Awareness (U) The Predictive Battlespace Awareness program developed tools to interactively draw upon a distributed network of human experts, allowing them to collaboratively anticipate an opponent's future actions. The program has enabled commanders to pre-position sensors, weapons, and information to counter the opponent's actions. The program developed model and knowledge-based techniques to predict areas of operation and tactical objectives. The technology supports the modeling of courses of action ranging over time horizons from hours to days. Program techniques permit \"on-the-fly\" tailoring of models and contextual knowledge, and leverage knowledge of sensor effectiveness, mobility factors, tactical templates, and target characteristics.

(U) The Network Enabled by WDM-Highly Integrated Photonics (NEW-HIP) program will facilitate building or upgrading military aircraft and other aerospace platforms with a wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) single-mode fiber-optic networking infrastructure. This will have many capabilities that are well beyond those of currently used copper- and multi-mode-fiber-based technologies. Originally, the program focused2.500 5.845 5.100 353UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #50 Page 20 of 35Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603760E COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMSPROJECT NUMBER CCC-02 B. Program ($ in Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 on specific technologies for application on the Navy's EA-6B Prowler aircraft, however, the program has been broadened to focus on technologies that will provide advanced capabilities to a multitude of military aircraft, such as the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). The NEW-HIP technologies and associated architecture will provide: scalability in the bandwidth and the number of connected devices; immunity to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and cable cross-talk; reduced cable and overall system weight and volume; increased reliability without an associated weight or volume penalty; ease of integration and future upgradeability; and the ability to carry mixed analog and digital signal formats. This will be accomplished by taking full advantage of single-mode fiber-optic WDM technology and leveraging optoelectronic and photonic integration techniques developed in DARPA photonics components program. To reduce the size, weight and power and to increase the reliability and the flexibility of interconnecting arbitrarily placed client devices with various signal formats, the NEW-HIP program will use passive, transparent and wavelength- routing technology at the core of the network, and tunable optical transmitters and receivers (transceivers) to inter-connect the client devices at the edge of the network. The technologies developed under this program are planned for transition to the Services. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Developed the target performance specification for NEW-HIP circuits to satisfy the generalized avionic networking requirements. - Conducted a successful proof-of-concept demonstration of high fidelity wideband analog signal transmission for the AN/ALQ-217 Electronic Support Measures (ESM) system using a WDM optical link in place of expensive precisely tuned coaxial copper cables.

Military Networking Protocol (MNP)* *Formerly Next Generation Routing and Addressing. (U) The Military Networking Protocol (MNP) program seeks to develop networks with full military organizational unit attribution. Current network routing methodologies use internet protocol (IP) address numbers that are distributed in no defined pattern or methodology. As a result, current routing systems spend large amounts of time and computing power updating and maintaining tables that \"point\" to where different IP addresses are located geographically. The MNP program will resolve this issue with network addressing schemes that will reduce the load on routers as well as greatly simplify router configuration. By clearly identifying network traffic, MNP allows the network infrastructure to provide prioritization levels, reallocate bandwidth between different users or different military units, and automatically make quality of service decisions. MNP traffic will be compatible with existing Internet infrastructure and may allow or deny entry or transit of unauthenticated data and transmit data as fast as (or faster than) existing network protocols. Hardware developed in this program will be self-configuring and will greatly reduce the need for trained network personnel and overall network's maintenance cost. This program is planned for transition to the Services. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Investigated transition opportunities for new network addressing schemes and completed trade study on the impacts on state of the art technology. - Completed military utility analysis to establish program stretch goals. FY 2009 Plans: - Develop machine naming schema for data packets that are geographically based and that allow for fine grained control of precedence and improved quality of service capabilities.1.250 4.550 2.000 355UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #50 Page 22 of 35Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603760E COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMSPROJECT NUMBER CCC-02 B.

Scalable MMW Architectures for Reconfigurable Transceivers (SMART) (U) The Scalable Millimeter-wave (MMW) Architectures for Reconfigurable Transceivers (SMART) program is developing a new technology for producing very thin millimeterwave array apertures and transceivers. The technology development will culminate in the demonstration of a large-sized coherent, active electronically steerable array (AESA) with an output power density of 5W per square cm and a total layer thickness of less than 1cm. The SMART technology approach will result in a breakthrough in performance over conventional millimeterwave approaches. The 3-dimensional (3-D) multi-layer assembles that are being developed will greatly reduce AESA packaging complexity and will enable very compact, low-cost, millimeterwave and radio frequency circuit \"building blocks\" to combine to form arbitrarily large arrays. New capabilities, such as the ability to construct reconfigurable and/or multi-band AESAs and other MMW circuits, will be enabled by this architectural approach. This program will transition through industrial producers of MMW radar systems for DoD applications.

(U) The Analog Logic program has the potential to reduce complexity and power requirements for signal processing functions while improving performance relative to digital implementations in field programmable gate arrays (FPGA), digital signal processors (DSP), and general purpose processors (GPP). The result is a significant reduction in system cost, increase in battery life, and higher system reliability and performance for critical wireless military communications system components. Furthermore, the technology will enable computational scaling to extend beyond anticipated limitations described by Moore's Law (the number of transitions on integrated circuits has doubled every year since the integrated circuit was invented). As a result of this effort, there will be a great saving in cost, power, and volume to many modern military systems implementing wideband signal spreading, spectrum utilization, multiple input multiple output channels and radar applications.

Radio Deception Networks (U) This program will develop software and prototype hardware to enable U.S. forces to easily conduct radio deception operations. For example, the system will make it appear that U.S. forces are not where they appear to be electronically, and vice versa. The radio frequency (RF) footprint for U.S. ground forces has dramatically increased with the proliferation of radios, blue force trackers, GPS, etc. A moderately sophisticated adversary can easily gain insight into our intent by monitoring our forces' RF spectrum usage. This program's objectives will include electronically portraying a mechanized infantry battalion, both stationary and moving; and portraying the same type of unit leaving an area while it actually remains in place. Additionally, there will be metrics that address the number of people required to organize the electronic deception operations. The program is of immediate and long-term use to the U.S. ground forces. This program is planned for transition to the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps. FY 2010 Plans: - Conduct a study to identify techniques and methods to steer directional signals using phased array antennas. - Develop algorithms, techniques, and control programs to enable RF signature deception. - Conduct breadboard testing of software solutions..000 .000 3.000 363UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #50 Page 30 of 35Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603760E COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMSPROJECT NUMBER CCC-02 B. Program ($ in Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 Polarized Rotation Modulation (PZRM) Communications (U) The goal of the Polarized Rotation Modulation (PZRM) Communications program is to develop new extremely high data rate, point-to-point, or point-to-multipoint wireless communications waveform using the PZRM/Orthogonal Signal Spectrum Overlay (OSSO) communications concept to exploit the presently unused polarization and rotation dimensions of radiation. The PZRM Communications program will investigate the use of polarization, including OSSO, modulation and the ability for conventional radios to carry all information over the transmitted signal amplitude, phase and frequency. Polarization modulation introduces an additional dimension. A radio with four polarization possibilities would transmit four times the information with all other aspects of the waveform held constant. OSSO enables multiple orthogonal signals to overlay one another in the same radio bandwidth thereby increasing spectral efficiency. Use of the antenna as part of the information processing architecture of a radio has not been previously performed. This technology has the potential to increase the capacity of existing radio channels without increasing spectrum or modem complexity. The program demonstrated as an enhancement to an otherwise state-of-the-art communications system. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Completed first phase of initial research. FY 2009 Plans: - Complete final assessment of technology.1.398 1.000 .000 Next Generation (XG) (U) The Next Generation (XG) program goals are to develop both the enabling technologies and system concepts to provide dramatic improvements in assured military communications in support of a full range of worldwide deployments through dynamic spectrum access. U.S. Forces face unique spectrum access issues in each country in which they operate due to competing civilian or government users of national spectrum. These constraints must be reflected in all force planning and may preclude operation of critical systems. Coalition and allied operations are even more complex to manage, and may severely limit the U.S. ability to fully exploit its superiority and investment in information technology. The XG program approach is to develop the theoretical underpinnings for dynamic access to the spectrum, the1.600 1.000 .000 364UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #50 Page 31 of 35Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603760E COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMSPROJECT NUMBER CCC-02 B. Program ($ in Millions) FY FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 technologies and subsystems that enable dynamic access, and the system prototypes to demonstrate applicability to legacy and future DoD radio frequency emitters. The program is investigating methods to leverage the technology base in microelectronics with new waveform and medium access and control protocol technologies to construct an integrated system. The program goals are to develop, integrate, and evaluate the technology to enable equipment to automatically select spectrum and operating modes to both minimize disruption of existing users, and to ensure operation of U.S. systems. The result of the XG program will be to develop and demonstrate a set of standard dynamic spectrum adaptation technologies for legacy and future emitter systems for joint service utility. The XG communications technology is planned to transition to the Army for implementation in a range of current and future communication systems including the Joint Tactical Radio Systems clusters. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Developed and demonstrated large-scale network organization and adaptation. - Integrated software into two military radios. - Conducted medium and large-scale military scenario demonstrations. FY 2009 Plans: - Complete technology transition to the Joint Tactical Radio System and current and future communication systems. Advanced Speech Encoding (ASE) (U) The Advanced Speech Encoding (ASE) program will achieve an order of magnitude reduction of voice communication bit rates over current state-of-the-art voice encoders (VOCODER) in noisy military environments. Such a reduction will significantly decrease the probability of detection of transmitted signals and will also decrease the required transmit energy, thereby increasing battery lifetime. The program will pursue two novel approaches toward achieving its goal. One approach builds upon multiple noise-immune sensors that have been combined with traditional coding algorithms to achieve significant improvements in intelligibility and quality in harsh noisy environments. This approach will be extended to nontraditional ultra-low-bit-rate coding algorithms. An alternative approach will explore communication without acoustic information achieved by extracting laryngeal and sublingual muscle signals that are3.992 3.995 .000 365UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #50 Page 32 of 35Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603760E COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMSPROJECT NUMBER CCC-02 B.

This approach will yield a revolutionary capability in situations where stealth is of the utmost importance, or in situations where acoustic signals cannot be used, such as under water. The ASE technology is planned for transition to the Special Operations Command and the Communications and Electronics Command of the U.S. Army after a prototype demonstration scheduled for FY 2009. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Developed a prototype real-time ultra-low-bit-rate communication system integrating the ASE VOCODER technology and a military radio. - Developed techniques to capture and enhance sub-vocal signals to enable stealth communication among warfighter teams. - Explored the nature of sub-vocalic signals (physiological source, speaker dependence, and robustness) and the information content of the signals. FY 2009 Plans: - Demonstrate a robust sub-vocalic silent-speech communications system. - Demonstrate the ultra-low-bit-rate communication system in the field. - Transition ASE encoding and decoding device and Government standards to DISA. - Conduct user demonstration of sub-vocalic prototypes. Conflict Modeling, Planning, and Outcomes Experimentation (COMPOEX) (U) The Conflict Modeling, Planning, and Outcomes Experimentation (COMPOEX) research effort is developing technologies that will enhance the capability of leaders to plan and conduct complex campaigns. This includes a comprehensive suite of decision support tools that help leaders with: visualizing and understanding the situation and the complex operational environment they must operate in; constructing and managing plans that enable the commander to synchronize and integrate interdependent effects over a long period of time; employing the best sequence of unified actions to produce the desired effects; and generating and exploring options and courses of action to understand the range of outcomes and appreciate the side effects that may occur.

FY 2009 Plans: - Complete final PACOM demonstration. - Complete the transition to OSD PA&E as one of their analytical tools. DARPA Interference Multiple Access (DIMA) Communications (U) The DARPA Interference Multiple Access (DIMA) Communications program will develop a networked radio system that supports voice, video and data. The goal of this program is a network that is dynamically controllable using techniques such as reconfiguration, optimum resource allocations based on mission priorities, and dynamic policies, as opposed to relatively passive reactions to changes by the commercial infrastructure. This program will initially develop direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) communications technologies as a building block to enable robust, mobile, tactical wireless networks, which are the foundation for network centric warfare concepts. The fundamental technical challenges are scalability, multi-user detection processing, low probability of detection/low probability of interception (LPD/ LPI), robustness and platform size, weight and power (SWAP) requirements. The DIMA Communications program will develop and demonstrate a system based on multi-user detection (MUD) concepts that take advantage of overloaded channels while operating in an environment absent of infrastructure (ad-hoc networked.) The technologies developed under this program are planned for transition to the services.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) The Network-Centric Warfare Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to develop and rapidly mature advanced technologies and systems required for today's network-centric warfare concepts. It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission. The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system. (U) The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations. Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness. Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants. These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated, and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable. Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning. Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies. Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required. (U) The Maritime Systems project will identify, develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept. Naval forces play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force. The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces. 377UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #53 Page 2 of 25Exhibit R-2, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Budget Item Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603766E NETWORK-CENTRIC WARFARE TECHNOLOGY B.

GEO algorithm architectures will be explored to achieve scalability through spatial, temporal and ontological partitioning. GEO technologies are planned for transition to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). The Urban Reasoning and Geospatial Exploitation Technology (URGENT) program (formerly Auto Metadata Extractions) will develop a 3-D urban object recognition and exploitation system that enables advanced mission planning and situation analysis capabilities for the warfighter operating in urban environments. URGENT will create techniques for the rapid exploitation of EO and LIDAR sensor data at the city scale to recognize urban objects down to the soldier scale. URGENT will apply image processing technology to geospatially registered 2-D/3-D data collected from airborne and terrestrial sources, yielding precise annotations for the objects in an urban area. URGENT will also develop a 3-D reasoning engine to query object shapes, locations, and classifications for advanced geospatial exploitation capabilities. The Exploitation Language Technology for GeoINT program will build a system to extract and linguistically confirm terms and labels of geographic significance from graphical, textual and audio sources. The program will develop the technology to associate and verify the extracted information against features extracted from imagery. Both extraction and association will be performed against and across multiple languages. A major effort will be made to develop necessary database and query technology to support a wide range of GeoINT specific concepts, e.g., feature classes, complex distance calculations, and boundaries. The Geospatial Representation Integrated Dataspace (GRID) program (formerly All Things Repository) will develop an automated geospatial data fusion, modeling, and dissemination system from national assets for the tactical warfighter. Geospatial registration algorithms will automatically fuse geospatial data from multiple sources including EO, LIDAR, SAR, and hyperspectral - and encode the fused data as a temporally indexed volumetric model that drastically reduces geospatial data storage requirements while enhancing image quality. Updates will propagate to the model using a compressed geospatial data format capable of reaching the warfighter even with the bandwidth constraints of tactical networks. 380UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #53 Page 5 of 25Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NETWORK-CENTRIC WARFARE 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2008 Accomplishments: Urban Reasoning and Geospatial Exploitation Technology (URGENT) - Demonstrated automated object recognition capability on fused EO and LIDAR data from aerial and terrestrial urban sources. - Evaluated performance of automated object recognition in comparison with the performance of human geospatial analysts.

Network Command (U) Network Command leverages recent advances in network computing, simulation, and visualization to dramatically improve collaboration among physically separate command posts and lower echelons. Network Command enables warfighters to share situation information and exploited data from the area of responsibility, develop coordinated battle plans, generate and compare alternate courses of action, and assess likely outcomes, without conventional group briefings. Network Command also enables warfighters to prepare for joint missions using high-fidelity, mixed-reality combat simulation and visualization technologies. The Network-Centric Situation Assessment program develops and deploys technologies to assess military situations at levels of interest above individual targets. The program uses all-source data to reconstruct unit organizations, mission relationships, logistics connections, and communications6.000 3.000 2.500 382UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #53 Page 7 of 25Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NETWORK-CENTRIC WARFARE FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 connectivity and analyzes data over time to infer movement, communication, and supply patterns. Within this context, capability analyses are provided and future courses of action are hypothesized. The objective is to understand potential capabilities and intentions of opposing forces. This effort provides greater understanding of opponents' force structures, capabilities, and operational practices, and then enables commanders to sustain effects-based targeting rather than simple attrition strategies. The program provides a context for discovering vulnerabilities in opposing forces and provides cues for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance planning, as it suggests areas of future enemy activity that merit intense scrutiny. Technologies are planned to transition to the U.S. Army. The Joint Mission Rehearsal program integrates high-fidelity, mixed-reality combat simulations with situation assessment and planning tools. The objective is to allow rehearsal of joint missions, prior to actual engagements. The visualization permits the warfighter to interact with both reality and the simulation simultaneously in a manner consistent with their anticipated role in the mission. The program delivers the capability to practice and fine-tune mission plans for joint military operations and enables commanders and staff to participate from their current location instead of a training facility, thereby reducing deployment needs while improving mission planning and effectiveness. Technologies are planned to transition to the U.S. Army Simulation, Training & Instrumentation Command, United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), and the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC).

Mobile Intelligent Sensors (MIS)* *Previously part of Precision Urban Combat Systems. (U) The Mobile Intelligent Sensors (MIS) program (formerly Smart Dust Sensor Networks Applied to Urban Area Operations and Exploiting Vibrations to Monitor Activities in Building) and the Remote Detection of Suspicious Vehicles (RDSV) program are developing advanced sensor, exploitation, networking, and battle management capabilities for joint dismounted forces. There is particular interest in exploiting new legged, wheeled, and tracked robots to create \"robot-enabled sensors\" that are capable of sensing, moving, and self-organizing into a viable network for reliable data exfiltration. The nodes will have a sufficient level of embedded intelligence so that they can identify, learn, adapt, and traverse through or under small openings and circumnavigate barriers larger than themselves, yet be capable of carrying an operationally-meaningful day/night sensor payload. Envisioned payloads include EO/IR for day/ night imaging and video surveillance/monitoring and acoustic/vibration sensing to obtain information such as foot and vehicular traffic, operation of mechanical systems, gunfire, excavation activities, etc. Technologies are planned to transition to the U.S. Army, U.S. Special Operations Command, and the U.S. Marine Corps.6.000 2.000 2.000 384UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #53 Page 9 of 25Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NETWORK-CENTRIC WARFARE 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2008 Accomplishments: Mobile Intelligent Sensors (MIS) - Identified/prioritized critical information requirements from networked, mobile intelligent sensors in an urban environment to support small tactical units and methods for information fusion/presentation. - Evaluated candidate sensor technologies and algorithms.

Seismic/Acoustic Vibration Imaging (SAVI) (U) The Seismic/Acoustic Vibration Imaging (SAVI) program will develop the capability to locate both near- surface tunnels and landmines with active seismic and acoustic sources. These systems will employ well characterized seismic and acoustic sources to stimulate the targets of interest from a remote platform. The interaction of the near surface seismic waves with tunnels and other objects will be observed with a multi-pixel laser interferometer system and used to assess the depth and extent of the targets in the midst of natural and man-made clutter. Similarly, focused acoustic sources will be employed to remotely stimulate plastic or metal antipersonnel and antitank mines. A laser interferometer system will be used to detect the resonant characteristics of the mines to discriminate against natural sources of clutter. The systems developed under this effort will be tested against a wide variety of soil types and environments to support operations under a wide range of conditions. Upon successful development of the initial and objective systems, the capabilities will be transitioned to the Army and Marine ground forces for the development and employment of operational systems starting in FY 2011. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Completed the preliminary reviews for the scalable system meeting the initial sensitivity and search rate objectives. - Initiated and demonstrated the technologies required for the laser interferometer system, including the sources and sensors, as well as the mobile seismic and directional acoustic sources. - Completed the development of operationally relevant test scenarios for scalable system demonstration. - Completed an outdoor demonstration of the acoustic landmine detection source and active seismic tunnel detection source meeting desired objectives.

Multipath Exploitation Radar (MER) (U) The Multipath Exploitation Radar (MER) program will address radar deficiencies in urban operations: limited line of sight due to urban structures and excessive confusers due to multipath reflections. This program will exploit multipath bounces to detect and track moving targets within urban canyons, and extend the area coverage rate of airborne sensors by a factor of ten or more over physical line- of-sight limits. If successful, the urban coverage improvement will make it cost effective to consider airborne surveillance of an area the size of a large metropolitan area with a handful of airborne sensors. This capability will facilitate both manned and unmanned airborne Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and is planned to transition to the Air Force and Army in 2010.

Human-carried Explosive Detection Stand-off System (HEDSS) (U) Insurgent and terrorist elements are increasingly relying on human carried explosives because they are nearly impossible to visibly detect. The goal of the Human-carried Explosive Detection Stand-off System (HEDSS) program is to develop a system that can rapidly and automatically identify human- carried explosives (HCEs) at a stand-off range of up to 150 meters. While alternative technologies exist for HCE detection, they necessitate close-in sensing, are expensive and require extended processing times. Successful development of a HEDSS with detection ranges of up to 150 meters will provide reliable protection for deployed forces from suicide bombers by allowing enough time and space to interdict bombers before they cause maximum damage. The technology is planned for transition to the Army, Air Force and Marines. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Designed and developed data collection system. - Conducted extensive data collection and analysis. - Developed algorithms and assessed system performance.

The MDMR platform will be able to support a variety of search missions in hazardous environments such as urban rubble piles. To achieve such a degree of mobility, design concepts must address system challenges such as: on board power management; situational awareness; complex terrain navigation; and system controls. The technology is planned for transition to SOCOM. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Developed smaller, more maneuverable serpentine platform. - Developed and tested tele-operation control. - Developed and tested sensors for integration onto the serpentine platform. - Performed rigorous testing to characterize system performance.

FY 2010 Plans: - Demonstrate real-time processing on brassboard hardware. - Conduct performance validation via demonstrations in a higher-complexity operational environment. Legged Squad Support System (LS3) (U) The Legged Squad Support System (LS3) program will explore the development of a mission-relevant quadruped platform scaled to unburden the infantry squad and hence unburden the soldier. Soldiers in current operations carry upwards of 50lbs of equipment, and in some cases over 100lbs, for long distances and in terrain not always accessible by wheeled platforms that support infantry. As a result, the soldier's combat effectiveness can be compromised. The LS3 program will design and develop prototypes capable of carrying 400lbs of payload for 20 miles in 24 hours, negotiating terrain and at endurance levels expected of typical squad maneuvers. LS3 will leverage technical breakthroughs of prior biologically inspired legged platform development efforts. It will develop system designs to the scale and performance adequate for infantry squad mission applications, focusing on platform, control, and human-machine interaction capabilities, as well as secondary design considerations, such as acoustic signature. Multiple technical approaches will be explored, including electromechanical and hydraulic methods of legged actuation. Anticipated service users include the Army, Marines and Special Forces. FY 2009 Plans: - Develop, analyze and assess preliminary designs to achieve a system capable of twenty miles of endurance in a twenty-four hour (unrefueled) period, carrying a 400lb payload. - Simulate gait selection, execution and transitioning. - Build subsystems that prove design validity.

Urban Ops Hopper (U) The Urban Ops Hopper program developed a semi-autonomous hybrid hopping/articulated wheeled robotic platform that could adapt to the urban environment in real-time and provide both surgical lethality and/or Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) to any point of the urban jungle while remaining lightweight, small and expendable to minimize the burden on the soldier. In general, small robots or unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) are severely limited by obstacle negotiation capability. The demonstrated hopping capability allows small UGVs to overcome obstacles 40x-60x their own size. Hopping will extend robot navigation to six degrees-of-freedom situational location and mapping. Hopping mobility can be shown to be five times more efficient than hovering for obstacles at heights less than or equal to ten meters. The proposed hopping robot would be truly multi-functional in that it will negotiate all aspects of the urban battlefield to deliver ISR and/or lethal payloads to non-line-of-sight targets with precision. The articulated wheel design allows the robot to negotiate short-range obstacles for precision placement in difficult terrain. This program is planned to transition to Special Operation Forces. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Developed 3-D ISR obstacle detection, classification, and mapping tools for an unknown environment. - Demonstrated autonomous navigation in an urban environment using upgraded mechanical and sensor suite. - Developed precision hopping through restricted pathways to include windows and stairwells. - Demonstrated precision hopping using upgraded mechanical articulated wheel design. - Evaluated technologies in various Military Operations on Urban Terrain (MOUT) facilities.4.200 .000 .000 C.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) The objective of the Maritime Systems project is to identify, develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept. Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems. Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force. The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces. B. Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 Persistent Ocean Surveillance (POS) (U) The Persistent Ocean Surveillance (POS) program combines geolocation techniques such as the global positioning system with station keeping and intra-sensor communication technologies to provide long-term ocean environment sensing buoys. These technologies, when applied with state-of-the- art undersea warfare sensors, will result in a floating field of smart sensors capable of observing the undersea environment in an area, including the presence of submarines and other undersea vehicles. A range of technologies have been considered including those that rely on the local environment (such as wind, ocean waves, solar energy, temperature differentials, etc.) for their power, miniature geolocation technologies, and technologies for sensor data storage, transmission, and intra-field communications. The Renewal At-Sea Power program focuses on efficient energy capture from the environment in order to achieve capability for fully renewable power at sea. Technology from this program will be available for transition to the U.S. Navy.

For uncharted and/or denied areas, present methods are inadequate for obtaining the necessary information. Reliable remote sensing methods do not exist that produce bathymetry and water current data in waters that are sediment laden (bottom is not visible) and/or sheltered (swell and significant wind waves are not likely). The River Eye effort will provide a new capability to predict or assess, in real time, river and estuary conditions to enable special operations mission planning and execution. New techniques will be developed to indirectly determine current speed and direction by remotely sensing advection of scene features. Using advanced modeling techniques, indirectly sensed current data will be used to extract bathymetry data. Forward circulation models will use the bathymetry data to predict future currents and water heights in a mission planning decision support tool. The River Eye effort is anticipated to transition to the Navy and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Demonstrated the feasibility of using an inverse circulation model to calculate the bathymetry given currents as an input. - Conducted two instrumented data collections of currents in a new environment/location and evaluated performance. FY 2009 Plans: - Continue development of the inverse model for extracting bathymetry from indirectly sensed currents. - Refine and tune algorithms for extracting circulation currents and bathymetry in more complex environments. FY 2010 Plans: - Improve the automation of the current extraction algorithms and inverse model to handle clouds and moving objects in the time series data.

The implicit goal of this program is to reduce platform infrastructure and, ultimately, the cost of future design and production of submarines. The program is a collaborative effort to overcome selected technological barriers that are judged to have a significant impact on submarine platform and infrastructure cost. DARPA and the Navy, under a Memorandum of Agreement, jointly formulated technical objectives for critical technology demonstrations in: 1) shaftless propulsion, 2) external weapons stowage and launch, 3) conformal alternatives to the existing spherical sonar array, 4) radical ship infrastructure reduction technologies that eliminate or substantially simplify hull, mechanical and electrical systems, and 5) automated attack center technologies to reduce crew manning. (U) Following success of shaftless propulsion technologies demonstrated in the Tango Bravo program, DARPA and the U.S. Navy will design, build, and test a large scale Submarine Shaftless Stern Demonstrator (S3D) to characterize and mitigate risks associated with ship integration into a next generation submarine propulsion option. The S3D will be built to the minimum scale necessary to extrapolate hydrodynamics, powering, and acoustics to full-scale performance. The most cost effective technical approach to developing the demonstrator design will be considered, including the modification of existing large-scale submarines. Elements of the Tango Bravo program will begin transition to the Navy in FY 2009, with full transition anticipated at the conclusion of the Submarine Shaftless Stern Demonstration (S3D) program in FY 2013.

MPSA will use layered and distributed sensing and add data from all sources for the non-traditional areas of infrastructure, socio-political developments and economic indicators. These systems will enable timely and coordinated decision-making and vastly improved situational awareness under uncertainty for naval commanders. MPSA will enable intelligent deployment of sensors and network infrastructures, to protect sea-based assets, through effective cross-platform and multi-mission fusion and resource management with focus on stand-off and elusive threats. Automated tracking with intelligent fusion and classification, and assimilation of non-traditional information sets are of particular interest. This will require bringing additional processing power to bear, allowing implementation of complex processing algorithms. MPSA will also enable the decoupling of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance/defense missions from offensive missions, improving the power projection capability of the deployed force. MPSA will depart from previous approaches in assessing the operational environment in that it will not rely solely upon military indicators, but will also expand understanding to include national infrastructure, socio-political, and economic indicators to better assess trends and threat development. FY 2009 Plans: - Develop technologies and system concepts for detection, classification, localization, tracking and optimized engagement of maritime targets. - Develop techniques to assimilate and process data from all sources to detect changes in national infrastructure, socio-political climate and economic indicators that could affect adversary military capacity and capabilities. FY 2010 Plans: - Assess effectiveness of component technologies through modeling and simulation. - Implement the techniques for assimilation and processing of classified and open source data to detect militarily relevant changes in a nation's physical infrastructure, socio-political climate and economic indicators. - Apply advanced human-computer interaction technology to optimize human/machine performance for the naval commander. 398UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #53 Page 23 of 25Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NETWORK-CENTRIC WARFARE FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 Blue Laser for Submarine Laser Communications (SLC) (U) The Blue Laser for Submarine Laser Communications (SLC) program was funded as the High Bandwidth Maritime Communications program in Budget Activity 2 (PE 0602702E) in FY 2009, but its applications focus made its funding more appropriate for Budget Activity 3. The program will develop the critical laser technology necessary to support the requirements for non-acoustic Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), mine detection, and submarine laser communication. SLC and non-acoustic ASW programs are intended to develop the world's first wall-plug efficient laser that operates both at an optimum water transmission band of open ocean water and at the wavelength of a Cesium Atomic Line Filter. There is a pressing need for improved ASW capabilities in the current operating environment, particularly in shallow water (above the thermocline) and littoral areas of operations. This laser has the potential to improve the detection depth of a non-acoustic anti-submarine warfare lidar system by a significant factor resulting in improved submarine communications. The Blue Laser technology is planned for transition to the Navy. FY 2009 Plans: - Design, build and test a power amplifier module to verify performance optically and thermally at high power. FY 2010 Plans: - Complete detailed design of flight brassboard transmitter. - Complete optical, mechanical and electrical designs. - Build and test optical, mechanical and electrical subassemblies for integration into the brassboard transmitter. - Commence building, integration, and testing of amplifier modules into a full power output subsystem..000 5.000 10.000 Thermal Management System for Ship Decks (TMD) (U) It is anticipated that the high engine exhaust temperatures from the next generation of Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft deployed on navy ships will dramatically reduce the life of both the deck structure and the non-skid.

Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 Low-Altitude Airborne Sensor System (LAASS) (U) The Low-Altitude Airborne Sensor System (LAASS) program is developing an airborne sensor system to find and characterize underground facilities (UGFs) used to shield and protect strategic and tactical activities, including command and control, weapons storage, and manufacture of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and tunnel networks that breach secure borders and perimeters. By passively capturing emissions associated with underground facility presence and operations, and doing so using airborne sensors (acoustic, electromagnetic, gravity gradiometry), LAASS can significantly increase our ability to seek out underground facilities and map out their vulnerabilities and backbone structure. LAASS technologies are planned to transition to Northern Command, Southern Command, Strategic Command, or Defense Threat Reduction Agency in FY 2011. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Developed system requirements for LAASS gravity gradiometer payloads (sensor characteristics, platform envelope) against targets of interest. - Explored gravity gradiometry system concepts for tunnel detection.15.619 15.750 4.000 405UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #54 Page 4 of 40Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NUMBER FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2009 Plans: - Commence evaluation of candidate sensor technologies for development of gravity gradiometer prototype evaluation system. - Produce system design and initiate development of gravity gradiometer prototype evaluation system.

Cross-Border Tunnel (CBT) (U) The Cross-Border Tunnel (CBT) program is developing technologies and systems to detect small tunnels used to breach security perimeters and national borders. The program goal is to develop innovative technologies inspired by geophysical exploration techniques that detect and characterize these threat tunnels while simultaneously satisfying operational considerations such as search rate, site access, monitoring persistence, and exposure of friendly forces. The initial CBT program thrust performed collections of seismic and electromagnetic (EM) data at a test bed using current state of the art sensors from the geophysical industry. (U) The program's current focus is on a Fast-Scan CBT detection technique. This technique will develop a tunnel detection system focused on providing a fast linear scan rate, for operationally tractable protection of large controlled areas or national borders. Current subterranean interrogation techniques based on geophysical exploration methods have the combined impediments of slow interrogation rate, need for complete site access, or exposure of forces. Contrary to invasive imaging methods, the Fast-Scan concept will provide rapid detection of anomalous subsurface structures consistent with voids. Additional techniques will be investigated to provide situational awareness to the warfighter for the underground environment. Technical challenges include: 1) identification of optimal detection strategies, source characteristics, and sensor geometries, 2) rejection of clutter with length scales similar to tunnels or1.852 3.750 3.000 406UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #54 Page 5 of 40Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NUMBER FY FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 response from non-threat structures (utilities), and 3) technology migration to a moving platform.

These strategically hardened facilities are used to harbor our adversaries' most dangerous assets including leadership bunkers, command and control functions, and weapons of mass destruction. However, because the size and weight of traditional earth penetrating weapons scale exponentially with the depth of the facility, current warhead penetration depths are and always will be insufficient to reach many of these targets. As a result, a strategic capability gap exists and new approaches to earth penetration and warhead delivery are needed. This program seeks to leverage recent advances in earth-penetrating technologies for full defeat of strategically hardened facilities. This program will transition to the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) in FY 2011. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Integrated advanced penetration and energy supply technologies. - Demonstrated penetration, energy, sensing, and navigation capabilities through field trials. - Demonstrated deployment capabilities.

Multipath and propagation effects are modeled and iteratively compared with hypotheses of building structures to provide 3-D building maps and large concentrations of metal materials like weapons. This program is developing techniques to inject and recover probing waveforms and unravel the complicated multipath in the return signals to enable the mapping and characterization of buildings. Other sensing modalities and component technologies are concurrently being investigated, such as acoustic, seismic, and thermal. These modalities offer the possibility of providing complementary information about the interior of large buildings as well as their associated underground areas. Transition of component pieces to the Army's Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier and U.S. Special Operations Command will commence in FY 2011.

Laser speckle has reduced sensitivity to adverse turbulence-induced distortion and so should provide a viable signal at ranges exceeding those projected for other active laser systems. Technical achievements under other programs in this PE/Project provide the basis for radically new approaches to measuring target characteristics under conditions that limit the performance of conventional sensors. Target characteristics potentially obtainable may include target image, shape, size, structural features, and other advanced threat properties. By extending the operating range of current active electro- optic sensors, SEER enables the friendly platform to stand off from the maximum operating range of hostile sensors/weapons, while executing the targeting task and directing weapons against targets. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Demonstrated concept performance on an outdoor range. FY 2009 Plans: - Develop algorithms that reliably and uniquely associate target signatures with speckle patterns. - Implement algorithms using optical Micro Electro-Mechanical systems (MEMs) or other related technologies to achieve reduced size, weight and power. Rescue Transponder (RT) (U) Building upon technologies developed in other sensor programs, the Rescue Transponder (RT) program will investigate the use of a unique localization and tracking technology to provide a very low probability of detection (LPD) call for help signal. The system will use a wide band radio frequency signal with low power and extremely low duty cycle. The goals of the RT program are to develop a small, rugged, transponder that provides a call for help to friendly forces. The RT system will operate over ranges that enable rescue forces or surveillance systems to receive its signals. It will support accurate localization by rescue forces, and permit transmission of identifying, authenticating, and status information.

Lightning Based (Sferic) Underground Geo-positioning (U) The Lightning Based (Sferic) Underground Geo-positioning program will address the challenges presented when navigating and tracking within underground structures, both manmade and natural, by exploiting the abundance and long propagation range of naturally occurring global lightning events. As conceived, surface receivers at known locations will compare time difference of arrival of very low frequency (VLF) sferic events and employ super-resolution correlation techniques to accurately determine the VLF source locations. Any subsurface receiver will also detect the sferics, and correlation with the surface data will enable geo-location of the subsurface receiver. Exploitation of naturally-occurring, non- deniable signals has the potential to significantly reduce logistical requirements and increase operational standoff by orders of magnitude (1000+ km).

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) The Sensors and Exploitation Systems project develops and demonstrates advanced sensor and exploitation technologies to provide accurate situational awareness and precise target identification. The project is driven by five needs: (a) integrating data from multiple sources into consistent situation assessments; (b) countering camouflage, concealment and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) wide-area, moderate- imagery; (d) obtaining real-time, accurate battle damage assessment; and (e) accomplishing robust, precise identification, precision fire control tracking and engagement of ground targets. U.S. forces and sensors are increasingly networked across service, location, domain (land, sea and air), echelon, and platform. This trend increases responsiveness, flexibility and combat effectiveness, but also increases the inherent complexity of sensor and information management. This project is creating systems that can derive high-level information from sensor data streams (from both manned and unmanned systems), produce meaningful summaries of complex dynamic situations, and scale to thousands of sources. Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from mobile missile/artillery to specific individual insurgents. This project develops and demonstrates system concepts that combine novel approaches to sensing, sensor processing, sensor fusion, and information management to enable pervasive and persistent surveillance of the battlespace and detection, identification, tracking, engagement and battle damage assessment for high-value targets in all weather conditions and combat environments. B. Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 Persistent Exploitation (U) The Persistent Exploitation program integrates a wide variety of sensors, data links, exploitation tools, correlators, and pattern analyzers into an end-to-end capability, focusing on counter-insurgency missions. These missions must be supported at all hours of the day, over large areas, and against a diverse set of targets, characteristics that no homogeneous sensor architecture can address. Persistent Exploitation ties separate hardware and software components together so that interactions among them can be defined, assessed, evaluated, and refined. It emphasizes real-time testing in realistic environments (e.g., the National Training Center (NTC)) so that subtle dependencies and interactions can be discovered.15.522 19.178 19.500 416UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #54 Page 15 of 40Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NUMBER FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 (U) The Persistent Operations Surface Surveillance and Engagement (POSSE) program is developing the capability to integrate sensor input from multiple modalities to find indications of insurgent activities. Combined with dynamically updated information from soldiers on the ground, POSSE will enable near-real- time generation of the evidence necessary for further investigation or interdiction. POSSE experiments are conducted at the National Training Center (NTC) with realistic role players emulating typical residential, commercial and light industrial activity. Within this environment, insurgent activity is simulated by qualified experts using the latest and most complete intelligence available. Measurements include precision collections of insurgent activities, as well as the realistic surrounding background clutter of typical civilian activity. Results will inform future experiments, lead to specifications for future sensor design, and provide insights into how to integrate other narrow and wide area sensors into an integrated approach to countering insurgencies. Transition is planned for U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Expanded investigation of close proximity sensor experiments designed to differentiate a location being used for insurgent activities from adjacent structures. - Initiated design and preliminary infrastructure development in conjunction with NTC. FY 2009 Plans: - Evolve close proximity experiments in the NTC environment to assess potential sensor technologies applicable to insurgent activity detection. - Continue spiral development with semi-annual exercises at the NTC and spin off mature capabilities to deployed analysis cells. - Integrate proximity sensor capabilities into the near-real-time POSSE exploitation process. - Correlate close and stand-off sensors into an integrated exploitation capability to detect insurgent networks. - Test operational capabilities at the NTC with operational analysis cells. FY 2010 Plans: - Continue experimentation with semi-annual exercises at the NTC and spin off mature capabilities. - Examine the feasibility of new sensor designs. 417UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #54 Page 16 of 40Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NUMBER FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 Network Centric Sensing and Engagement (U) The Network Centric Sensing and Engagement thrust develops technology and tools to support precise situational awareness, rapid targeting, and precision engagement in highly-networked environments. Network-centric sensing acknowledges a group of sensors as a system and leverages networked intercommunication to enable system performance superior to that of uncoordinated individual sensors. Applications include advanced target detection, acquisition, tracking, and combat identification. The technology is suited to both ground-based sensors and airborne multi-ship sensor systems. Exploiting the potential of network-centric sensing requires a number of approaches. Required technology advances include: sensor-to-sensor communications, multi-sensor management, sensor system georegistration, real-time data fusion, advanced tracking, and network-centric sensor operational modes. Network technologies enabling precision electronic warfare will also be investigated. Programs in this thrust include: The Quint Networking Technology (QNT) is a modular, multi-band, network data link program focused on providing capabilities that close the seams between four nodes - manned aircraft, weapons, tactical unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) and air control ground units. The program designs, develops, evaluates and demonstrates robust, affordable data link technologies suitable for use by weapons, tactical UAV's, and air control units. This includes shrinking the package size of data link capabilities to the size of a cell phone. These data links enable precision strike and efficient machine-to-machine targeting against time critical and mobile targets, support combat identification of targets, disseminate tactical UAV and ground sensor data, and provide bomb impact assessment. The data links allow secure weapon handoff from the launch platform to any of several control platforms in the combat area, both air and surface. The QNT units provide two modes: a low rate bi-directional mode and a high data-rate mode capable of either continuous or a burst imagery/video transmission. Dynamic net resource management technology will scale to support hundreds of vehicles in flight. Advanced information security techniques provide secure weapon data links and controller handovers. DARPA has established a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Air Force Command and Control & Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Center, Navy Program Executive Officer, Strike Weapons and Unmanned Aviation, and Air Force Research Laboratory to transition the QNT technology.8.470 7.097 7.000 418UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #54 Page 17 of 40Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NUMBER FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 The Tactical Level Operations Capability (T-LOC) program (formerly Expeditionary Dismount Geolocation and Exploitation System) will develop and deploy technologies to integrate temporal-spatial data from multiple sources to increase situational awareness. The program uses organic reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition data to update tactical users and planners over multiple echelons with critical environmental and operational information. There is particular interest in riverine operations, and within this context, sensor, delivery systems, exploitation algorithms, and information management and display technologies will be developed. T-LOC will provide the means to discover vulnerabilities in opposing forces and cues for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance planning. Technologies are planned to transition to the U. S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps. FY 2008 Accomplishments: Quint Networking Technology (QNT) - Built and evaluated brassboard in Stage 1 tests. FY 2009 Plans: Quint Networking Technology (QNT) - Cycle and test brassboard in Stage 2 tests and flight tests. - Start transition to Air Force and Navy.

It develops tools for movement pattern analysis, algorithms to predict target motions, and dynamic control methods for sensor tasking and observation scheduling. Programs in this thrust include: The Video Verification and Identification (VIVID) program developed technology to automate moving target strike operations for remotely piloted aircraft. Program products support both precision strike operations and military surveillance. VIVID enables the handoff of targets between wide area coverage intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems and local video surveillance platforms. The technology provides techniques for precision target identification in video including fingerprinting techniques and related technology to reacquire previously observed vehicles. The VIVID technology transitioned to the Air Force at the conclusion of Phase II, at the end of FY 2008. The Forensic Target Motion Analysis program develops and demonstrates exploitation tools to analyze Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) Radar tracks of multiple targets to separate militarily-interesting target movement from nominal background traffic (e.g. civilians, coalition operations). It develops libraries of movement patterns, logic to generate hypotheses about which patterns are being observed, algorithms to correlate sensor data to those patterns, and mechanisms to quantitatively score the consistency of the data with each hypothesis. It also includes tools to provide short-term predictions of target motions, thereby supporting some forms of predictive threat analysis. FY 2008 Accomplishments: Video Verification and Identification (VIVID) - Demonstrated real-time software components on tower. - Demonstrated real-time software components in flight test. - Started transition to the U.S. Air Force.

Target Identification Technology (U) The Target Identification Technology thrust develops semiautomatic methods to identify targets from sensors operating in all spectral bands. Its objective is to detect, characterize, and identify military threats, and to assess the environment around them. Data sources include national, theater, and organic sensors. Exploiting the acoustic emissions of potential targets is of interest because acoustics has the advantage of not requiring an unobstructed line of sight between the emitter and sensor, and under certain circumstances sound may propagate great distances. Critical performance metrics are timeliness, accuracy, error rates, and interpretation workload. The thrust addresses the challenges of target identification, acquisition and tracking under restrictive rules of engagement. The technologies will apply advanced signal processing and machine vision to leverage advances in sensor capabilities. Three programs are funded in this thrust: The Exploitation of 3-D Data (E3D) program developed techniques for rapidly exploiting 3-D sensor data. The initial program effort consisted of three distinct processes: Target Acquisition, Target Recognition, and Modeling. The resulting software tools were integrated into operational ground stations processing 3-D sensor data. The E3D technology was transitioned to Special Operations Command (SOCOM). The All-Source Target Characterization program develops a collection and measurement capability to characterize new targets as they emerge on the battlefield. This effort develops tools to permit rapid user interaction with imagery, sensor data, and processing results and provides real-time feedback to operators indicating key target features and other discriminates. This initiative will also develop and demonstrate robust target cueing and identification over large classes of targets within a computational form factor appropriate for insertion into strike aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles. The technology provides tools to process and disseminate target signatures to the field in usable formats for direct insertion into operational8.896 9.000 8.000 421UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #54 Page 20 of 40Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NUMBER FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 systems. Technologies are planned for transition to the Air Force Distributed Common Ground Station in FY 2011 and subsequently to the U.S. Army Future Combat System. The Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Detection System (SUDS) program, formerly Detect Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), develops techniques to detect, track, and provide discrimination between friend and foe against small UAVs that are easily built, inexpensive, easy to operate, and offer the asymmetric adversary an ability to reach into U.S. defended locations causing potentially large amounts of damage. It includes antenna and signal processing techniques to passively detect small air targets using radar, video, acoustic, and radio-frequency sensors; to correlate those data with known objects (e.g., civilian aircraft); to analyze the motion of any uncorrelated data; and to rapidly task narrow-field-of-view sensors to collect more-detailed data. It will transition to the military in FY 2012 to meet both static force protection needs and tactical air defense operations. FY 2008 Accomplishments: Exploitation of 3-D Data (E3D) - Conducted real time data collection for models in library. - Transitioned E3D to SOCOM.

FY 2010 Plans: Small UAV Detection System - Develop and demonstrate target identification capability. - Integrate multiple sensors for target classification. - Evaluate system performance for positive identification of friend or foe. Advanced Radar Sensor Technology (U) The Advanced Radar Sensor Technology thrust develops radar systems to provide significant improvements in our ability to detect, identify, and track surface targets and threats over very wide areas in all climatic conditions. Program efforts focus on exploiting emergent and novel RF sensing technology and phenomenology. Key elements are advancements in ultra-wide band, bistatics, UHF/VHF, location and direction-finding, polarimetric change detection, tomographic imaging, space-time adaptive processing and other advanced signal processing, advanced Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) techniques, and foliage, building, and ground-penetrating radar phenomenology. Program developments are integrated with current and emerging military platforms with emphasis on the most stressing military radar sensor challenges. Examples are operations featuring complex cluttered ground environments; those against small and slow moving surface targets; urban operations, and situations where camouflage, decoys and countermeasures must be overcome. Programs in this thrust include: The NetTrack program will extend capabilities for persistent tracking and targeting of moving vehicles from airborne radars. Operational GMTI radars can display the locations of thousands of movers over a11.527 18.960 22.890 423UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #54 Page 22 of 40Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NUMBER FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 wide area. Operators of these systems can focus on an individual GMTI detection and follow the vehicle down a road network until a so-called \"confusion event\": the vehicle reaches an intersection at the same time as other traffic; another vehicle comes close to it traveling in the same direction; the GMTI platform has to make a turn. After the confusion event the operator has no way to determine which of several local target detections is the vehicle that the operator was following. NetTrack will improve capabilities in two ways: the system will network radars together and use advanced radar techniques to gather \"signatures\" of vehicles. The signatures, which are collections of radar features, will be stored and passed over the radar network. The system will compare vehicle signatures taken before and after confusion events to maintain the track of the target vehicles. Extended long-term airborne radar tracking will be an important long- range, all-weather capability. It will extend the kill chain to enable vehicle engagement hours after target designation, enable behavioral analysis of vehicle movements to gauge enemy operational structure, force composition, and intentions, and provide a higher level of situational awareness at every level. Technologies are planned for transition to the Navy, Army and Air Force. The Dual Beam Lynx program will enhance the capabilities of the Lynx radar system to track slow- moving vehicles more accurately. The program modifies a Lynx I radar to create two beams with different phase centers and uses space-time adaptive processing to detect moving targets in the main beam clutter. The goals of this program include demonstrating improvement in minimal detectable velocity, improving geolocation accuracy, and achieving a low manufacturing cost. The radar performance will be demonstrated from flight data collected from the radar flying on a UAV surrogate. Technology is planned for transition to the U.S. Air Force. The Next Generation RF Antenna System program will develop and demonstrate a light-weight wide- band RF antenna that enables high gain over a broad frequency range. This system will enable signal detection at extended ranges, detecting faint or distant signals with high gain. This program is planned for transition to the U.S. Air Force. The Airborne Passive Direction Finding with a Tactical Vector Sensor (ATVS) program will develop and demonstrate a compact, lightweight, airborne, real-time, tactical emitter detection and location system suitable for supporting small tactical units. ATVS sensors will fly on a tactical UAV such as the Scan Eagle 424UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #54 Page 23 of 40Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NUMBER FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 and will provide company/battalion size forces with a dedicated airborne sensor for detecting and locating emitters. ATVS provides accurate estimates of the angle of arrival in both azimuth and elevation. This program is planned for transition to the U.S. Army. The Efficient Digitization of Element Signals program will exploit new and emerging techniques in signal coding and compressive sensing to allow large, element-count, radio frequency (RF) arrays to be digitally sampled using small numbers of receivers. Most existing RF arrays used in radar, communications and Signal Intelligence systems have highly constrained digital beamforming capabilities since the element- level signals are not digitally sampled; rather, these signals are combined into a single beam or sometimes sub-array beams before digitization. This sub-optimal combining was necessary because the number of receivers, analog-to-digital converters and data rate of the system are limited by the available size, weight, and power. However, compressive sensing techniques present the opportunity to reclaim this lost performance. Technologies are planned for transition to the Navy, Army and Air Force.

Significant challenges arise as the result of two warfighting trends. First, the ever-changing mix of airborne platforms, now includes greater numbers of smaller UAVs. Second, the target set is increasingly challenging and now includes vehicles and individual dismounts that operate under foliage and in urban canyons, using camouflage, obscurants, and other means of concealment. In response to these challenges the Advanced Airborne Optical Sensing program brings recent advances in optical, electro-optical, photonic and other technologies to airborne optical sensing systems. Specific examples of these technologies includes: embedded image processors tailored to real-time detection, identification, and tracking of military targets; hyper-spectral sensing technologies; flash detection; and underwater object detection; advanced laser radar technologies; advanced digital signal processing to support onboard image reconstruction, atmospheric correction, and system calibration; video exploitation techniques including new approaches to scene understanding and activity detection; adaptive optics techniques, such as deformable mirrors and liquid crystal spatial light modulators. The program extends these technologies and makes them practical for airborne surveillance systems. Technologies developed in the Advanced Airborne Optical Sensing program are planned for transition to the U.S. Army and the U.S. Air Force. Efforts in this program include: The Standoff Precision ID in 3-D (SPI 3-D) program is developing an affordable sensor package capable of high-resolution 3-D images for confirmatory target ID at long ranges as well as full field of view (FOV) ranging to support precise geolocation of targets. The system provides intensity, range and polarization information for each pixel in the field of view with each laser pulse. The program includes a series of ground-based and airborne demonstrations of SPI 3-D precision ID capabilities and track fusion techniques. The objectives are to provide: (1) high range resolution 3-D imaging; (2) full FOV range to pixel determination; (3) multiple frame-to-frame registration of imagery, and (4) GPS-based cueing from search systems. Results will provide commanders with significantly improved long-range identification of enemy ground targets, as well as targeting information to support guided weaponry. The SPI 3-D system employs optics, focal plane arrays, and gimbals combined with a range measurement technique. SPI 3- D technologies are being designed to achieve a Class IV UAV-compatible (Predator, Firescout & Warrior) configuration for installation into a Multi-spectral Targeting System (MTS) turret for transition to the U.S. Air Force at the conclusion of Phase III.

This will support long range sensors that can detect highly obscured targets under canopy/camouflage as well as very wide-area search for submerged targets including sea mines and semi-submerged mobile vessels. Spatially Processed Image Detection and Ranging (SPIDAR) is a coherent imaging method that allows one to form a large, effective optical aperture from a set of smaller, lighter telescopes providing for very high-resolution 3-D and 2-D ladar imagery of distant targets with a compact system configuration. This capability is very well suited for long-range engagements from airborne or space-based platforms and could significantly enhance the current synthetic aperture imaging approaches by providing the desired cross-range resolution along the axis perpendicular to the direction of travel. This capability is also applicable on a small scale to provide very-high resolution imagery in a compact and potentially man- portable configuration for long-range ID. The gain in size, weight and power over more conventional lidar implementations will be assessed and demonstrated. The effort will improve performance of the technology, specifically using diffuse reflective targets, targets with lower contrast and reduced intensity reference beam. Additionally, suitable missions and platforms for the technology will be identified. SPIDAR technologies will be transitioned to the U.S. Air Force in FY 2013. The Tactical Aircraft to Increase Long Wave Infrared Nighttime Detection (TAILWIND) program (formerly Hyperspectral Framing) will develop and demonstrate a system for collecting and processing IR data operating as a framing sensor. The system will accept long wave infrared and color camera images permitting day/night reconnaissance for real-time target detection and tracking. The resulting sensor and processing system will provide an order of magnitude increase in the combination of area coverage over current systems, and a decrease in time to focus the sensor operator's attention on relevant targets. The TAILWIND system is planned for transition to the U.S. Army by FY 2012.

Each video window is electronically steerable and independent of the others. ARGUS-IS can also provide a global moving target indicator for vehicle size objects across the entire field of view. ARGUS-IS is comprised of three major subsystems: (1) a Gigapixel Sensor Subsystem (GSS) which consists of a set of four telescopes and is mounted in a 3-axis stabilized gimbal; (2) an Airborne Processing Subsystem (APS) which takes raw pixels from the GSS and performs all required processing; and (3) a ground processing subsystem which provides the interface to the user and records down-linked imagery. A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for the transition of ARGUS-IS from DARPA to the U.S. Air Force. The transition period is FY2009- FY2010. The Autonomous Real-time Ground Ubiquitous Surveillance - Infrared (ARGUS-IR) program is developing an airborne sensor system that provides a persistent, real-time, high-resolution, wide-area night video surveillance capability. ARGUS-IR uses an advanced infrared (IR) focal plane array (FPA) sensor.

ARGUS-IR will utilize the signal/image processor developed as part of ARGUS-IS, enabling ARGUS-IS and ARGUS-IR to be combined into a common pod. ARGUS-IR must overcome a number of demanding technical challenges beyond those faced by ARGUS-IS. The most significant challenges relate to the IR FPA and size, weight, and power constraints for the IR sensor. Technologies are planned for transition to the U.S. Air Force.

Large Area Coverage Search-while-Track and Engage (LACOSTE)* *Previously this was part of Advanced Airborne Optical Sensing. (U) The Large Area Coverage Search-while-Track and Engage (LACOSTE) program enables a persistent, tactical-grade ground moving target indicator (GMTI) capability in dense urban areas. Wide-area continuous tracking of moving vehicles requires very small coverage gaps, small resolution cells, and target separation and identification features. The ideal sensor has the area coverage rates of GMTI radar and the resolution/identification capabilities of an electro-optical infrared system. The LACOSTE program will provide wide area surveillance, simultaneous tracking, and target engagement with electro-optical and infrared sensors for tactical GMTI operations. The program is developing a sensor with a very wide field of regard (90 degree cone angle), and a wide instantaneous FOV that is rapidly scanned in a search-while- track mode, tracking up to 10,000 targets in an urban area. Additionally, the LACOSTE sensor will provide next-generation precision tracking to enable engagement on a large number of (approximately 100) targets in dense urban areas within that same field of regard with minimal penalty on the search-mode area coverage rate. The program is also developing a rapid \"zoom\" capability for target identification that enables feature-aided tracking through dense target environments, plus sufficient target identification for separating like-targets when back-tracking a particular target via the historical track data. The LACOSTE technology is planned for transition to the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Army at the conclusion of the program.4.407 12.150 15.460 432UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #54 Page 31 of 40Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NUMBER 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Developed objective system designs and demonstrated the core technologies - electronically addressable mask and computational imaging algorithms.

FY 2010 Plans: - Manufacture and test full-scale components. - Perform system integration and laboratory testing. - Demonstrate performance (sensitivity, resolution, and tracking) via tower testing. Synthetic Aperture Ladar for Tactical Imaging (SALTI) (U) The Synthetic Aperture Ladar for Tactical Imaging (SALTI) program will develop and demonstrate an airborne synthetic advanced laser radar (LADAR) capable of creating a synthetic aperture for high- resolution, three-dimensional imagery at long ranges. The technical objective of the SALTI program is to provide a proof-of-feasibility for operation at tactically relevant high altitudes and at long ground ranges. The SALTI approach combines the long-range day/night imaging afforded by conventional synthetic aperture radar techniques exploiting high power, high bandwidth laser radars. The result is 3-D imagery for target location and identification at high fidelity and potentially small size and weight. The SALTI program has produced the first-ever synthetic aperture LADAR images from aircraft. FY 2008 Accomplishments: - Developed lasers for higher power and higher bandwidths to support Long Range Demonstration (LRD). - Characterized propagation through the atmosphere under operational conditions to assess long range operational performance. - Generated and modified system design to support LRD.6.689 16.000 .000 433UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #54 Page 32 of 40Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NUMBER 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2009 Plans: - Develop high power, high bandwidth ladars for meeting SALTI requirements. - Develop mitigation techniques to counter atmospheric turbulence effects. - Develop and test acquisition, pointing and tracking subsystem for creating synthetic aperture ladar images at long range. - Review feasibility of designs to place SALTI in a pod. Ground Targeting Sensors (U) The Ground Targeting Sensor thrust provides sensors and signal processing systems to detect, identify, and engage close-in ground targets. Its products are installed on platforms that operate on the ground (HUMVEE, convoy elements) and near the ground (helicopters). They employ technologies that defeat or compensate for the unusual atmospheric conditions near the surface (turbulence, dust, strong propagation losses) in order to provide timely and accurate detection and classification of dismounts, small vehicles, and terrain obstacles. Programs in this thrust include: The SandBlaster program will develop a helicopter pilot performance enhancement system for landing in degraded visual environments such as Iraq and Afghanistan dust clouds. Sandblaster addresses this important operational challenge in a Blackhawk platform environment, in four distinct areas: (1) Advanced flight controls which enable the helicopter to auto-land at a pilot-selected landing point; (2) See-through sensing based on a forward-looking three dimensional W-band radar, which enables the pilot to see through the dust and select a safe landing point; (3) A powerful fusion engine which combines map and obstacle database knowledge with real-time radar data to construct a full current assessment of landing zone hazards; and (4) An enhanced synthetic vision display to present this evolving real-time landing zone information to the pilot in the most useful manner, combined with all necessary aircraft-state symbology needed to complete a safe landing. The technology developed under this program will transition to U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Army. The Super-Resolution Vision System (SRVS) program will develop and build a field prototype soldier- portable optical system that will demonstrate improved recognition and identification range over existing17.540 17.952 15.000 434UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #54 Page 33 of 40Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NUMBER FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 systems. The key technical innovation is exploitation of atmospheric turbulence-generated micro- lensing phenomena to generate images that are superior to diffraction-limited images. A variation of lenses approach, to include adaptive polymer lenses, will also be investigated. SRVS will facilitate new operational and tactical opportunities for land forces. Through enhanced resolution imaging, SRVS will (1) extend target recognition and identification to decisively longer distances; (2) overcome atmospheric turbulence, which now limits the ability of high-resolution optics; and (3) increase target identification confidence to reduce fratricide and/or collateral damage. It will culminate in a field demonstration of a prototype. Technology developed under this program will transition to Special Operations Forces. The Short Wave Infrared through Fog and Clouds (SWIF) program will develop and demonstrate advanced signal processing and optical imaging technology to allow detection of collision and grounding threats in fog and clouds at useful ranges (day or night), which substantially degrade performance in precision handling operations. Humans are able to operate successfully with sensor assistance, but situational awareness significantly degrades. Successful development of this technology will restore this situational awareness to tactically relevant distance and time scales. Significant technical obstacles that must be overcome include development of an ultra-short pulse laser with sufficient bandwidth and fast enough pulse rise time to create transient-like propagation characteristics in an aerosol cloud, distributed active sources, and advanced filtering techniques. Technologies are planned for transition to the U.S. military.

Soldier-borne Sensor Technology (U) The Soldier-borne Sensor Technology thrust provides sensors for improved situational awareness and effectiveness of individual soldiers. It builds small unit enemy weapon fire detection and classification tools, more precise target designation sensors, and methods for improved small arms weapon effectiveness. Programs in this thrust include: The Crosswind Sensor System for Snipers (C-WINS) program will provide optical techniques to correct for crosswinds on ballistic objects. The C-WINS program will develop a novel weapon mounted optical correction sighting system for various rifles and machine guns. An eye safe laser and a high speed camera will record motion of eddies in the atmosphere to measure wind profile that will used to provide ballistic correction. The system will provide offset corrections to the shooter for compensating the aim point affected by the crosswind. Key parameters of interest are: a) bullet hit points less than the target size at any range up to weapons effective range; b) down range profiling up to weapons effective range; c) ranging accuracy sufficient to provide elevation correction; d) automatic ballistic correction; e) day/night operation; and f) no setup or calibration. Additional capabilities could include: increased effective ranges for a wide range of weapons; eye safe ranging; increased ID range during day and night; and shimmer compensation. This program is planned for transition to the U.S. Army and Marines. The Laser Geospatial Referencing (LGR) system will allow ground troops to designate targets for engagement by air forces where the pilot or UAV operator can see the designated spots within the field of view of their visible or forward looking infrared system. The LGR concept provides nearly instantaneous target location, identification and designation capabilities to weapon platforms supporting urban or other ground operations. The LGR concept enables these assets to be immediately directed by dismounted soldiers.

LGR technologies will be transitioned to the U.S. Army and Marine ground forces, and U.S. Air Force and Army. The Sensor Tape program will develop and demonstrate a low-cost, one-time-use, low-power, band- aid size, adhesive-applied blast dosimeter that records accumulative blast effects for integration into combat medical care. Significant technical obstacles that must be overcome include achieving adequate switching frequencies, packaging, print-on ink technologies and production costs.

This program will develop and demonstrate robust, low cost, small size, weight and power (SWAP) distributed electronic warfare (EW) platforms to allow the warfighter to disrupt and impede an adversary's communication network. The PreEW program uses an array of nodes that have synchronized clocks to enable the signal from each node to be aligned so that the carrier and phase are focused on the desired location. The effect will be to place the desired energy on the specific target area while not affecting the non-target area. The node is planned to contain localization, network, synchronization and jamming processing and communication in a low-cost, easily deployable package.

Foliage Penetration Reconnaissance Surveillance Tracking and Engagement Radar (FORESTER) (U) The Foliage Penetration Reconnaissance Surveillance Tracking and Engagement Radar (FORESTER) program is developing an ultra high frequency (UHF) ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radar that can detect dismounts and vehicles moving under dense foliage. In the first phase of the program, the FORESTER was installed on a Black Hawk and flown in a series of successful demonstrations in the U.S. and OCONUS. In the second phase of the program, FORESTER was successfully flown on the A160, a revolutionary high-altitude long-endurance unmanned helicopter developed by DARPA and the U.S. Army. FORESTER development is now finishing up with radar field experiments conducted jointly with operational users to refine and optimize FORESTER radar performance and concepts of operation. At the conclusion of these experiments FORESTER will transition to Service partners.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) Fire-and-forget stand-off weapons need precise targeting information if critical fixed and mobile targets are to be eliminated effectively with minimal collateral damage and minimum cost-per-kill. This requires that: 1) military surveillance and targeting systems geolocate targets accurately in the same coordinate system in which the weapon system navigates; 2) the surveillance, targeting and weapon systems have precision navigation and guidance systems on-board; and 3) navigation and target location systems robustly operate day/night and in adverse weather. In addition, future systems designed to accomplish precision strike missions must be significantly more affordable. Thrusts are included in this project to improve our ability to navigate when the Global Positioning System (GPS) is jammed or otherwise unavailable; to increase the versatility of navigation systems applications by developing microelectromechanical sensor inertial navigation system technologies; and to apply the geolocation technologies/techniques to precision threat geolocation of short-dwell emitters or passive air defense systems.

Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 Multifunctional Electro-Optics for Defense of U.S. Aircraft (MEDUSA) (U) The Multifunction Electro-Optics for Defense of U.S. Aircraft (MEDUSA) program will develop the technologies and systems to give the U.S. air dominance at low altitude and at night. This program will develop the technologies to leap-frog reactive end-game countermeasures and enable increased threat warning times, denial of launch, and put Electro Optical-Infrared (EO-IR) air defense threats at risk. MEDUSA is a three-part technology program: 1) conduct phenomenological measurements and develop countermeasures and target classification/identification techniques; 2) develop critical component technologies such as high-power IR laser sources, advanced IR detectors, and fibers for high-power IR transmission; and 3) develop and demonstrate an end-to-end MEDUSA system.

Robust Surface Navigation (RSN)* *Formerly Robust Surface and Sub Surface Navigation (RSN/SSN). (U) The Robust Surface Navigation (RSN) program will provide the U.S. warfighter with the ability to navigate effectively when the Global Positioning System (GPS) is unavailable due to hostile action (e.g. jamming) or blockage by structures and foliage. The RSN program will use Signals of Opportunity (SoOP) from a variety of ground, air, and space-based sources, and augmented by judiciously placed RF beacons; these will be received on the Warfighter's forthcoming software defined radios and use specially tailored algorithms to determine position.

Sub-Surface Navigation (SsN) (U) Building on technologies developed under the RSN program, the Sub-Surface Navigation (SsN) program will provide the U.S. warfighter with the ability to navigate effectively underground, when the Global Positioning System (GPS) is unavailable. SsN will also enable long endurance or covert underground missions where alternative navigation aids like inertial measurement units (IMUs) or inertial navigation units (INUs) are unsuitable. The SsN program will use Signals of Opportunity (SoOP) and will develop specialized low frequency RF beacons and specially tailored algorithms to provide three- dimensional navigation of personnel and mobile platforms underground. SoOP include global lightning events, which are abundant, propagate over very long distances, and are essentially non-deniable signals. The greater strength and diversity of these signals will provide coverage when GPS is denied due to lack of penetration through the earth. This is a two part program: (1) analysis and performance modeling and hardware-based concept validation of beacon-based signals, and experimental verification that SoOP have propagated (and dispersed) through various geological overburdens and can be correlated with sufficient accuracy to achieve desired geolocation resolution; and (2) designing, testing, and demonstrating a (non-3.340 2.948 1.343 447UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #55 Page 6 of 9Exhibit R-2a, PB 2010 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency RDT&E Project Justification DATE: May 2009 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400 - Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide/BA 3 - Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603768E GUIDANCE TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NUMBER 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 form-fit) prototype and for geolocation using both beacons and SoOP.

FY 2010 Plans: - Complete transition of SoOP technology to U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). Precision Inertial Navigation Systems (PINS) (U) The Precision Inertial Navigation Systems (PINS) program will develop an entirely new class of inertial navigation instruments using atomic inertial force sensors. These sensors utilize the quantum- mechanical wave-like nature of atoms in the atomic analogue of an optical interferometer to provide unprecedented sensitivity to accelerations and rotations. The atomic sensors will further be used to measure the local gravitational field gradient to ensure that instrument alignment is properly maintained throughout vehicle maneuver, thus mitigating gravity-induced navigation errors.
