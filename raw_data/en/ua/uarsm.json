The [FDA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fda?trk=public_post-text) just authorized BNT162b2 for emergency use. As Americans get vaccinated over the next weeks and months, we hope that lives will be saved and COVID-19 will slowly come under control in the U.S. BNT162b2 has also been authorized for emergency and interim use in the U.K., Canada, Bahrain, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. We've plenty of reasons for optimism. Our latest [#NEJM](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fnejm&trk=public_post-text) paper shows that the cumulative incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 cases among placebo and vaccine recipients began to diverge by 12 days after the 1st dose - as shown below. These data indicate an early onset of a partially protective effect of immunization. We're learning a lot from the data generated by our studies and those of our peers. This is innovation in action - we all are quickly gathering new knowledge and acting upon it to face the virus. Today's news is the result of a collaborative effort. I am very proud of my team at [BioNTech SE](https://de.linkedin.com/company/biontech-se?trk=public_post-text), and I'd like to express my gratitude for our colleagues at [Pfizer](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pfizer?trk=public_post-text) and all those who helped, especially our trial participants all around the world for their trust. We are honored to play a role in this historic process, which is just beginning. Dear Uur AHN and \u00d6zlem T\u00dcREC, With your statement on 08.01.2021, \"very promising results have been obtained in the first experiments with the anti-inflammatory vaccine that causes MS disease\", you gave us hope again. My mother Beyhan \u00c7F\u00c7 was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) 30 years ago. She participated in the studies as a subject in Ankara Ibn-i Sina Hospital, but no results were obtained. After the diagnosis, she started to experience intermittent and short-term vision loss. After a while, she started walking with a cane due to the strain in her legs. She started to live in a bed 15 years ago due to weakness in her arms and body injuries due to numbness and she has been living in bed for 15 years. My mother is in the last stage of the disease now. For this reason, she wants to participate in your work as a \"Subject\" both to hope for future generations and to spend the rest of her life in a healthy way. We are making an intense effort to reach you from everywhere. We look forward to the evaluation of our request and your feedback with great hope. Thank you for being hope to humanity, Regards Congrats Congratulations Congrats Ugur! Love this Ugur, I have a question I was talking about with my friends but don't know the answer. The question is whether a person already developed a healthy immune system after recovered from Covid-19 or a person already immune to the virus but doesn't know. Should those people receive the vaccine? If they do, would be any side effects because vaccination may super boost their immune system? Tesekkur. Alp Ugur Sahin I just received the following from a friend in NYC who works in a hospital and uses your vaccine Allergies are expected. This why most Americans are clueless about medicines and side effects. They expect no side effects but smoke weed, use tobacco,, do drugs, drink alcohol, and eat enormous amounts if unhealthy foods and have no problem with these side effects. Great job!! Thank "}
