INFLUENZA VACCINE ADVERSE REACTIONS Because influenza vaccine contains only non-infectious purified viral proteins, it cannot cause influenza. An occasional case of respiratory disease following immunization represents coincidental illnesses unrelated to influenza immunization. Mild Problems: Soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given. Hoarseness; sore, red or itchy eyes; cough, fever, aches, headache, itching, and fatigue. If these problems occur they usually begin soon after the shot and last 1-2 days. Severe Problems: Life-threatening allergic reactions from vaccines are very rare. If they do occur, it is usually within a few minutes to a few hours after the shot. In 1976, a type of inactivated influenza (swine flu) vaccine was associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS). Since then, flu vaccines have not been clearly linked to GBS. However, if there is a risk of GBS from current flu vaccines, it would be no more than 1 or 2 cases per million people vaccinated. This is much lower than the risk of severe influenza, which can be prevented by vaccination. The safety of vaccines is always being monitored.
