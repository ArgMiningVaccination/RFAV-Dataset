I felt God's love. His presence. But I was made to feel guilty about worldly pursuits. I began to shun my family's religious dogma. My faith in God also started to wane. I never completely rejected God (came close). But with time thankfully I was able to begin experiencing my spiritual awakening. For some, the start of their spiritual awakening is marked by one powerful event. For others (like myself) there are soul healing events that take place periodically along the path to enlightenment. This path is constantly unfolding. To be enlightened means to be in complete loving awareness. Very few of us will reach this point here in the 3rd dimension. It's the journey, the healing process that really matters. You Came Here to Experience the Physical World as a Spiritual Being Before you came into this world you had the opportunity to plan what karma you wanted to heal. You knew that the Earth school would be tough. Most likely you've been here many times before. Also, you knew that you would forget who you truly are. This was done on purpose. The more your soul is mired in density, the more powerful your journey to awakening will be. Many souls desire to come to this Earth school. Being physical is all about learning your limitations and how to work through them. Even though you're currently physical much of you is still non-physical. It's ok to love this 3D world. You came here to experience its beauty and pain. The family you have is very important. They are here to help you along your journey. You have contracts with them that you want to fulfill. This matters greatly in the spiritual world. Being physical and in the 3D is a spiritual event. You need to be connected to the physical in order to grow. "}
