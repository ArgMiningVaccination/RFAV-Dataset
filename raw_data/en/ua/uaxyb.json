Students will investigate the subfields of linguistics, such as phonology, morphology, semantics, syntax, discourse and pragmatics, language acquisition, second-language research methods, and language pedagogy. This course is about how to use language acquisition research and generalizations derived from it to inform teaching practices and materials design. We concentrate on learning the history of language teaching methods so that we can solidify our current beliefs on teaching. Those considering teaching in the future can reflect on how to apply both the emerging and ongoing developments, research, and trends, such as translanguaging pedagogy, TPR storytelling pedagogy in the field to classroom instruction. While this course is particularly designed for students interested in investigating the most effective methods for language instruction, it is also geared to raise awareness of how languages are both taught and ascertained.

Students learn about the challenges of literary translation (both of prose and poetry) and through a hands-on workshop approach, acquire the necessary skills to navigate them. Some of the questions we consider include: How does one translate word play and humor? What is more important, meaning or form? How is the quality of a translation assessed? What gets translated and why? Students translate from Spanish into English and vice versa, and across different genres and registers. Students also learn about how the literary translation industry works and finish the semester with a translation ready to pitch to editors.
