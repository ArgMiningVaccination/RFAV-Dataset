Children received about 237 mcg of Thimerosal by two years old with the first 200 mcg administered before six months old. Thimerosal is an ethylmercury preservative (about 49.6 percent mercury by weight) used in vaccines to add shelf life to the vaccine. Thimerosal is about 50 times more toxic due to it being injected, there is no blood-brain barrier in infants, mercury clings to brain cells and nerves, and infants do not create bile therefore the mercury cannot be excreted. PDD-NOS are the largest group and are characterized by four other different disorders. The four disorders Every year, tens of thousands Americans die from the seasonal flu alone. This alarming statistic is what led the United States government to urge the country to vaccinate themselves, as well as their children every November, when the flu season is fast approaching. Though countless Americans do follow the government's plea, many others insist that these vaccines distributed every year (as well as other year-long vaccines) contain an abnormally high amount of thimerosal, (a mercury-based chemical in vaccines designed to prevent the growth of bacteria) which could eventually lead to autism. This generation of fear is what has led many concerned parents to refuse to vaccinate their children, who seem to be the most vulnerable to this disease. Vaccinations and Autism Spectrum Disorder Summary of \"Vaccines Cause Autism\" In the article, \"Vaccines Cause Autism,\" Michael Snyder, an attorney and writer, attempts to convince parents of young children that autism is directly linked to childhood vaccinations. He claims that numerous toxins, including thimerosal, are present in vaccines that are forced into the bloodstream, later causing neurological and brain damage to children. He says that autism has risen by 78 percent over the past decade, and that 1/88 children in the US have an autistic disorder. Snyder believes that most autistic individuals start out completely normal, and that the vaccinations they are given are harming them. He blames the pharmaceutical companies for being too Some people oppose vaccinations and compulsory immunisation requirements, believing that parents should have the right to choose whether or not they wish to vaccinate their children. Some people also believe that vaccinations are potentially harmful due to the presence of toxic chemicals, such as mercury, formaldehyde and aluminium, within their make up (The Healthy Home Economist, 2010; International Medical Council on Vaccination, 2011). These theories were encouraged by a paper published in 1998 supposedly linking the MMR vaccine with the development of autism in children. However, it was later found that this paper had been falsified, and it was eventually retracted in 2010. It is thought, by some, that the pharmaceutical companies producing vaccinations cannot be trusted, as they are money oriented and have been accused of 170). Thimerosal was first introduced in the 1930's and is a preservative that eliminated the bacterial contamination in vaccines, but could possibly sit in the brain and cause neurological damage (Mooney, 2009, p. 60). Before 1989, American preschoolers had to only receive three vaccines; for polio, diphtheria-pertussis, and MMR. In 1999 the FDA and CDC decided that vaccine users should reduce or even get rid of the amount of thimerosal used in vaccines. The CDC also recommended that newborns should wait to get the Hepatitis B vaccination until a thimerosal free vaccination became available (Miller & Reynolds, 2009, p. 170). According to head of the chemistry department at University of Kentucky, Dr. Boyd Haley, \"'You couldn't even construct a study that shows thimerosal is safe, it's just too darn toxic. If you inject thimerosal into an animal, its brain will sicken. If you apply it to living tissues, the cells die. Knowing these things, it would be shocking if one inject it into an infant without causing damage'\" (Kennedy, 2005, p. 59). With the being said, vaccine manufacturers began working to find a way to make a thimerosal-free vaccination, and eventually they made one. Then a decade later, children were receiving a total of 22 vaccinations by the time they started first grade. As the number of vaccines that children needed went up, the autism rate stayed Koch (2000) affirms that, \"drugmakers and health officials say there is no proof of a causal relationship among vaccinations and severe adverse reactions and that maintaining public health This paper tries to make the reader believe that vaccinations are safe to use as well as a crucial part of keeping people safe from disease. This paper cites a variety of online sources, such as the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Recent Thalidomide is a pharmaceutical that was introduced in the 1950's that was a seemingly simple drug that was prescribed to take care of many ailments. Thalidomide was marketed to help with all kinds of symptoms from the flu to morning sickness to something as simple as helping you sleep. It was considered a medical panacea. The drug had many key selling points. Not only could Thalidomide help with many symptoms, it was also marketed as safe for everyone including pregnant women. When testing Thalidomide the LD50 seemed nonexistent. Additionally, as they increased the dose of thalidomide to find a threshold, they found none. (The Shadow of Thalidomide, NYTimes). Thalidomide was sold over the counter in Germany. In some European countries However, the theory of vaccinations causing autism was proven wrong. No evidence has been found to connect autism to vaccines. \"There remains no convincing evidence of harm caused by low levels of thimerosal in vaccines\" says the Vaccine Advisory Committee (Benjamin 2003). One explanation for the once associated risk was that kids are tested for autism at the same age they are administered their first vaccinations. A doctor says that while some parents are worried that vaccines may be linked to autism, the theory has been scientifically discredited and should not be a factor to worry about (Reddy 2015). While some parents may still try to link the false theory together, they will continue to come up with an argument that has no evidence to back their theory up. A study done by the institute of medicine came to a conclusion that a Thimerosal is a mercury containing organ mercurial that is found in many vaccines. In 1999, concerns from parents and health administrations were raised on the theory that vaccinating children under the age of two would cause autism. By 2001, thimerosal was taken out of all childhood vaccines in the United States, with the exception of various flu vaccines, in regard to these concerns and merely as a safety precaution. However, there has proven to be no link between autism and vaccines containing thimerosal through various scientific studies by officials. Upon first glance, immunizations look like a terrific solution to a horrific problem. But what if these immunizations were causing horrific problems of their own? What if the ingredients of the injections were just as bad as the disease they were meant to prevent? A staggering 77% Michelle Cedillo, a happy normal girl, was born in Arizona in 1994. When she was 16 months old, she went to the hospital to get her routine MMR vaccine, a vaccine to prevent Measles, Mumps and Rubella. A week after her vaccination, she had a fever of 106o F. Gradually, In their informational article \"Thimerosal in Vaccines\", the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) analyzes In 1962 there was a large number of babies born with severe physical defects across Germany and the UK. Around 3,000 children were born with either missing or deformed limbs. The cause was determined to be the sedative drug Thalidomide which had been prescribed to mothers for morning sickness. The MMR Vaccine: Examining the Evidence In 1963 the Noble Peace Prize winning virologist John F. Enders finally licensed his vaccine for measles. Prior to this vaccine the United States alone reported 4 million cases of the measles each year. With more scientific discoveries the measles vaccine today has evolved "}
