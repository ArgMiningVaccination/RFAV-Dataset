Serrano has been blessed by God to help people since childhood when he first remembers hearing angels. As he grew, he wanted to learn more about the metaphysical world. Serrano became a registered nurse in 2004 and worked in that industry for five years, but he sensed that a facet of his purpose was missing, so he began helping other people spiritually. He learned that nothing worked better than the gift he was born with\u2014communicating with Spirit Guides. Now he points others toward finding their true illness, then helps them through the process of Biomagnetic Pair Therapy. This is a new revolutionary, scientific and therapeutic approach to healing that differs from traditional medicine, homeopathy, herbs and naturism. Biomagnetic Pair Therapy is also free of side-effects and perfectly compatible with any other traditional or alternative practice. Serrano will be at the Cosmic Center of Spiritual Light for the entire day on February 25. Location: 4041 Ringwood Meadow, Sarasota. For "}
