Mechanisms and competing viral replication origins; http://www.research-projects.uzh.ch/p4833.htm 01.12.1997 31.12.2012 (FP) of marine turtles is a neoplastic disease associated with infection by a poorly characterized herpesvirus, which has recently been named Chelonid herpesvirus 5 (ChHV5; previously also known as FP-THV or CFPHV) and was assigned, based on partial genomic sequences, to the subfamily alphaherpesvirinae (Davison et al., 2009). Unfortunately, serial propagation in cell cultures of ChHV5 has not yet been successful. Therefore, the corresponding features of basic virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology are not well understood and prophylactic measures and/or possibilities for selective clinical interventions are difficult to assess. However, the viral agent can be detected and quantified by various PCR-based methods. We have cloned a large part, if not the entire viral genome as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC; CH-651-60O9; pTARBAC2.1 vector), which was, subsequently, sequenced. Overall, the organization of the sequence resembles that of HSV, which is consistent with the classification of the agent. Surprisingly, the sequences featured also genes that are normally not seen in members of the alphaherpesvirinae. Results 2010 Sequence analysis up- and downstream of the pTARBAC insertion site revealed that this plasmid had been introduced within an open reading frame with similarity to UL52, a typical herpesvirus gene, encoding for a component of the viral helicase/primase complex. Using FP-associated UL52 (F-UL52) as an anchor and the BAC-derived sequences as a means to generate specific primers, overlapping PCR was performed with tumor-derived DNA as template. These experiments identified at least four genes not commonly found in the backbone of an alphaherpesvirus genome. Specifically, genes from two proteins carrying the signature of the C-type lectin-like domain superfamily (F-lec1, F-lec2) were identified as well as two genes encoding for an orthologue to the mouse cytomegalovirus M04 (F-M04) and a viral sialyltransferase (F-sial). The latter two genes were also expressed in tumors from wild Hawaiian FP-cases and may play a role in FP pathogenesis. Akademischer 2010 Virologisches Pathogenesis of Malignant Catarrhal Fever (MCF) and Molecular Analysis of its Agent; http://www.research-projects.uzh.ch/p2265.htm Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) is a fatal infectious disease of cattle and cervids, and occasionally also of swine (reviewed in Ackermann, 2005/2006). The agent of the wildebeest-associated form of the disease is the alcelaphine herpesvirus type 1 (AlHV-1). The agent causing the sheep-associated form (SA-MCF) of the disease has not yet been isolated. However, the genome of the ovine herpesvirus type 2 (OvHV-2, a gamma herpesvirus), which is responsible for SA-MCF, has been cloned and sequenced (Hart et al., 2007). According to the genomic sequence, OvHV-2 is a Macavirus of the subfamily gammaherpesvirinae. Its genome may be divided into genes conserved among all herpesviruses, genes conserved among gamma herpesviruses, genes conserved among OvHV-2 and AlHV-1, and genes specific to OvHV-2. At least 10 of the viral genes have similarity to cellular genes, encoding putative homologs to interleukins (e.g. IL-10, Ov2.5) and other host cell factors (e.g. Bcl-2, Ov9). According to our previous microarray study (Meier-Trummer et al., 2009c), the status of OvHV-2 in diseased animals is predominantly latent but may require restricted nests of virus replication, taking place at least in certain tissues (Meier-Trummer et al., 2009b). To our surprise, specifically the Ov2.5 and Ov9 genes had been found to be silent throughout MCF. Only two loci of the viral genome were actually transcriptionally active, LANA (ORF73) and a region, where even no gene at all had been predicted. On the host's side, our microarray study revealed that transcripts needed for attenuating of the immune response were amiss, i.e. IL-2 and TGF-beta. These issues were tackled in 2010 with the following results: 1) In search for the origin of the RNA transcribed from a region of the OvHV-2 genome that had not been predicted to encode for a gene, we have detected a multiply spliced transcript, whose introns fulfill certain characteristics of a miRNA. 2) Due to the obvious lack of IL-2 and TGF-beta mRNAs in cattle with MCF, we asked, whether the regulatory T-cells (Treg) were being infected by OvHV-2. We found that among the three different types of Treg, the CD4-, CD25-, foxP3-triple-positive cells were not a consistent target of OvHV-2 throughout MCF. The results concerning the Tr1- and Th3-subpopulations are not yet available. 3) We generated antisera against Ov7 and Ov8, two OvHV-2-glycoproteins that are not expressed during latency but may be used as markers for lytic replication of the virus. Thus, these antisera are available for isolating and analyzing cells, harboring replicating OvHV-2. Furthermore, w e g e n e r a t e d m o n o c l o n a l a n t i b o d i e s a g a i n s t L A N A , w h o s e c o d i n g g e n e (ORF73) is abundantly expressed during both latency and MCF. These mcAbs will help us isolating and analyzing any OvHV-2-infected cell, independent of the viral status inside. Akademischer Bericht 2010 Virologisches Institut 17 Universit\u00e4t Z\u00fcrich Studies of the dynamic and formation of the replication machinery in mammalian orthoreovirus and rotavirus; http://www.research-projects.uzh.ch/p12189.htm The replicative cycle of mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRV) and rotavirus have some features in common, as for example the primary transcription and translation of the proteins required for the formation of the replication machinery that starts once the viral cores penetrate into the cytoplasm. The structures in which these processes takes place are called viroplasms for rotavirus and viral factories for MRV, and are responsible for the transcription from negative templates, replication of the new genome segments as well as the assembly of the newly synthesized core particles. These structures, without lipidic membranes, are composed by structural and non-structural viral proteins and presumably host proteins. Very little is known about the formation, structure and dynamics of these machineries of replication. Essentially, in the case of reovirus, these structures are formed by the viral matrix protein \u00b5NS, which, in the absence of other viral proteins, forms globular factory-like structures (FLS) identical in morphology to the factories from the globular strains. During the viral infection \u00b5NS interacts with the viral core protein \u00b52, which has an NTP/RTPase and RNA binding activities. Moreover, \u00b52 is able to bind microtubules (MT) by itself, while in co-transfection with \u00b5NS redirects the globular factories t o M T , d e v e l o p i n g a f i b r i l l a r m o r p h o l o g y t y p i c a l o f t h e f i b r i l l a r s t r a i n s , l i k e t y p e 1 Lang. Recently, it was determined that heavy and light chains of clathrin multimers bind viral factories and specifically the C-terminal of \u00b5NS. The reason for the re-localization of this host protein remains largely unknown (T. Ivanovic and M.L. Nibert, unpublished data). During my postdoctoral training in the lab of Max L. Nibert at Harvard Medical School, I was involved in the study of the dynamics and formation of the viral factories. The data I have obtained suggest that viral factories are highly dynamic structures that increase in number until few hours post-infection and then start to decrease, indicating a fusion of the globular structures. This mechanism is MT-dependent, and there is evidence suggesting that the molecular motor dynein it is involved as well. Additionally, further research on this area indicates that viral factories are able to reorganize the cytosolic network. Specifically, microtubules from cytoskeleton are reorganized through an MTOC-like structure inside each factory, especially around 12 hours post-infection. These MTOC-like structures seem to recruit specifically the viral \u00b52 and the host gamma-tubulin (C. Eichwald and M.L. Nibert, unpublished data). On the other hand, Rotavirus forms viroplasms that are conformed essentially by the non-structural proteins NSP5 and NSP2. NSP5 is a hyper-phosphorylated protein that regulates its own phosphorylation by an intrincate mechanism in which are involved the NTP/RTPAse protein NSP2 and the protein kinases CK2 and CK1alpha. requires presence of NSP2 to form globular viroplasm-like structures (VLS). It has been described that rotavirus viroplams fuse among them, becoming bigger perinuclear structures. In both species, the dynamics of formation and localization of the machinery for viral replication seems to share a common pathway or at least share host proteins required to maintain the globular structures, elements required for the fusion of the factories and more. It is of special interest to understand how and which elements are required in the formation of these structures. A common limitation in the studies described above is that: i) Reverse genetic for dsRNA, specifically for rotavirus and reovirus, has only been developed just in the last year through a complicated methodology and ii) they had been performed in cellular monolayers, which is distant of the real geographic disposition inside a living organism. The purpose of our research is to evaluate the mechanism by which host and viral proteins interact to form the replication machinery in both MRV and rotavirus. With this aim, I propose three strategies to afford this issue: 1) Isolation of MRV viral factories through differential centrifugation, resolution of the component though mass-spectrometry and physiological characterization on their role in viral factory formation; 2) Study of the stoichiometry of viral components in MRV and rotavirus viral factories, this study will be done through the expression of the viral proteins with an amplicon system, in which the amount of protein per cell can be tightly regulated. In addition, this study will be performed with already characterized viral mutant proteins to determine the role of specific functions of these proteins in factory formation; 3) MRV is found in two kinds of viral factories, globular and fibrillar, that apparently have no distinction in virus yield cultivated in non-polarized fibroblast monolayers (CV-1 and L-929 cells). It is of particular interest to study the geographical disposition of the viral factories in a well-established system of polarized cells. We hypothesize that the difference in viral factories morphology in polarized cells will have an effect in virus-host interaction with a concomitant virus yield disparity.

Nibert (Dept. Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA), Dr. Oscar Burrone (Molecular immunology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy). Akademischer Bericht 2010 Virologisches Institut 19 Universit\u00e4t Z\u00fcrich A mouse model for a rotavirus vaccine based on Bacillus subtilis spores; http://www.research-projects.uzh.ch/p12190.htm Rotavirus is the major etiological agent responsible for severe diarrhea in infants and newborn animals. In humans, rotavirus is the responsible of causing the annual death by dehydration of approximately half million children under the age of five, mostly in developing countries. This virus still has been the major responsible for pediatric hospitalization due to diarrhea in Europe and the US. From a veterinary aspect bovine, porcine and equine rotaviruses cause diarrhea diseases in their respective host species having high economic impact on the livestock industry. Interestingly, an increasing amount of data suggest that rotavirus has to be regarded as a zoonosis, which emerges from direct contact between humans and infected farm animals. The requirements for a good and equitable vaccine are: i) little or no sensitivity to temperature fluctuation (cold chain independence), ii) single dose for immunization and iii) deliver of the vaccine mucosally, transcutanuosly and parenterally with needle-free devices. With these requirements in mind, we are currently working on a vaccine based in spores of B. subtilis. As dormant life forms, bacterial spores can survive for extended periods in a desiccated state; resist temperatures as high as 90C as well as exposure to noxious chemicals. In B. subtilis, the morphology, biochemistry, physiology and genetics of sporulation are extremely well understood. In a spore, the single chromosome in condensed in the core spore that is surrounded by layers of lipid membranes and modified peptidoglycan. The spore coat corresponds to a laminated proteinaceous shell that provides spore resistance to organic solvents. It had been already demonstrated that spores could resist the gastric barrier and germinate in the gut of mice, rabbits and humans. In addition, available evidence suggest that vegetative cells of B. subtilis play a primary role in the development of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and somatic diversification of the Ig genes, when these cells were introduced into germ-free appendices of rabbits. On the other hand, TasA, an extracellular protein of B. subtilis, which is secreted but also found in association with both cells and spores, is fundamental for biofilm formation. This is particularly interesting since there is evidence pointing to the fact that B. subtilis could persist in the mouse gut, suggesting that they have adapted to carry out their entire life cycle within the gastrointestinal tract, likely forming biofilms. This makes TasA an attractive candidate for both antigen presentation and continuous stimulation of immunity. Finally, an additional advantage of the use of B. subtilis is that it is used as probiotic in humans and considered safe for oral use in food supplements. Taken together, these characteristics make the B. subtilis spores a perfect candidate for oral vaccination purposes. The vaccine project has two branches in which, B. subtilis spores will express: 1) peptides of the rotavirus capsid proteins, VP7 and VP4 and 2) small immune protein (SIP) that are neutralizing against a highly conserved region of the spike protein VP4, called VP5CT. In both cases, the proteins will be fused to the C-terminal of the TasA protein. In the first part, VP7 and VP4 will be divided in different regions of their primary sequence, based on their capacity to be recognized by neutralizing antibodies, as described in the literature. Additionally, to enhance the humoral immune response against these specific regions, a fusion with the highly immunogenic protein VP6 will be performed. The second part of the project is aimed to find a broad-spectrum neutralizing-antibody for rotavirus. For this purpose, a segment of the body region of VP4 (VP5CT) will be selected. This region is particularly well conserved among all strains of rotavirus A, making it a good candidate as vaccine target. A phage display library for SIP will be used to select neutralizing antibodies against VP5CT (Li E et al. (1997) Protein Eng. 10(6): 731-736). The selected antibodies will be fused to the C-terminal of TasA. In both projects, mice will be orally administrated with recombinant spores and then challenged with homo and heterologous infection with rotavirus. We expect that the spores will germinate in the gut of mice and block the infection. This project will be developed in collaboration with Dr. Claudio Aguilar (Dept. of Microbiology; University of Zurich), Dr. Roberto Kolter (Dept. Microbiology and Molecular Genetics; Harvard Medical School, Boston MA, USA) and Dr. Oscar Burrone (Lab. Molecular Immunology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy). Akademischer Bericht 2010 Virologisches Institut 20 Universit\u00e4t Z\u00fcrich Role of Toll-like receptors in the development of insulin resistance in feline and human type-2 diabetes; http://www.research-projects.uzh.ch/p6893.htm Background: In the course of type 2 diabetes pathological processes resembling chronic inflammation occur, in which the adipous tissues play a major role by producing proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover diabetic patients are more prone to infections, from the other side sepsis is associated with transient insulin resistance. Thus proinflammatory events influence the sensitivity of tissues to insulin modulating glucose metabolism. The molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena are currently unknown and are the object of our investigations. Toll-like receptor (TLR) mediated recognition of specific structures of microorganisms (pathogen associated molecular patterns) initiates innate and adaptive immune response mechanisms. TLRs can also be triggered by endogenous ligands like heat shock proteins. Furthermore there is increasing evidence that TLRs play a role in the regulation of cellular homeostasis. This is also suggested by the fact that these molecules are also found in cells that are not directly associated with immune recognition of pathogens. Our working hypothesis is that activation of TLRs via pathogen associated molecular patterns or by endogeneous ligands (induced by oxidative stress or high glucose concentrations) generate proinflammatory responses that modify the metabolic behaviour of insulin target cells and beta cells modifying their physiology. Own data LPS activates human adipocytes and induces the expression of proinflammatory molecules like IL6 and TNF alpha. Therefore these cells must express the molecule complex responsible for LPS signalling, in particular CD14 and TLR4. We tested this hypothesis by RT-PCR and found that human adipocytes and feline adipous tissue express most of the TLRs. Human bone marrow derived adipocytes reacts to some TLR agonists in particular to LPS (TLR4) and poly-I:C (TLR3) and to a lesser extent to and lipoteichoic acid) with upregulation of IL6 mRNA. We focussed on the effects of TLR3 and 4 ligands, we tested insulin dependent and independent glucose uptake and found that glucose uptake is influenced by TLR3 and 4 stimulation, furthermore 2 molecular m a r k e r s f o r i n s u l i n r e s i s t a n c e , G L U T 4 a n d I R S-1 were downregulated at mRNA level in Adipocytes stimulated with TLR-ligands. Additionally, both LPS and poly I:C treatment clearly induced lipolysis in human bone marrow derived adipocytes. In cats we focussed our attention to pancreatic islets. Feline islets are more difficult to obtain than those from other species because they don't possess a clearly defined basal membrane that separate them from the exocrine pancreas tissue. The islets that we obtain are surrounded by acinary cells and have been defined as islet-like clusters (ILC) by other authors (maeno et al., 2006). We established the methods for obtaining ILC and detected most TLRs in these cell aggregates. Treatment with TLR ligands also induces IL6 mRNA upregulation. The exact source of the proinflammatory markers needs to be defined. Enrichment of Beta cells based on fluorescent staining of Zink with Newport Green and FACS sorting was improved. Populations of viable cells with a stronger mRNA signal encoding for insulin were obtained. These cells showed also reactivity to TLR agonists upregulating IL-6 mRNA. We identified an antibody suitable for the detection of feline IL-6 and detected TLR induced IL-6 upregulation at protein level. We are now focussing on feline adipose tissue as insulin target organ. We found ideal condition for the development of feline adipocytes starting from a fibroblast cell line. These conditions are very different than those used for human or murine cells. A critical factor is the presence of fatty acids. The obtained cells show the typical morphology of adipocytes and can be specifically stained with oil red. Despite this facts the expression of typical adipocytes markers like adiponectin, fatty acid binding protein (aP2) and Bericht 2010 Virologisches Institut 21 Universit\u00e4t Z\u00fcrich Outlook Because the principal focus of our group is feline diabetes, we decided to analyze the effect of proinflammatory activity on the metabolism of feline adipocytes. We are analysing the critical factors necessary for the expression of adipocyte markers in feline fibroblast derived adipocytes. If we cannot induce these factor we will consider to induce adipocytes starting from bone marrow derived mesenchimal stem cells. We will analyze biochemical markers of insulin resistance and effect on lipolysis, induced in these cells by TLR mediated proinflammatory genomes; http://www.research-projects.uzh.ch/p4834.htm Generation and analysis of recombinant herpesviruses is a useful tool to study specific details of viral infections. Herpesvirus genomes cloned as bacterial artificial chromosomes are made available for recombination with tools of bacterial genetics. We succeded the cloning of intact full-length viral genomes from bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1), feline herpesvirus type 1 (FeHV-1), and bovine herpesvirus type 5 (BoHV-5)(Gabev et al., 2009; Richter et al., 2009). BoHV-1 and BoHV-5, have the same host and the genomic sequences of the two viruses are highly similar over the entire genome. Although the sign of disease caused by the viruses are markedly different. In particular, BoHV-5 is a neurovirulent virus, which cause fatal encephalitis in calves whereas BoHV-1 is associated with abortions and respiratory and genital infections. Both are neurotropic and establish latency in the trigeminal ganglion following intranasal conjunctival inoculation. The cloned genomes of BoHV-1 and BoHV-5 facilitates the mutation these viruses. We are interested in generation of intertypic BoHVs and to analyse these viruses in regards of their infection in host cells. We focused on the generation of viruses with intertypic glycoproteins. In particular glycoprotein D (gD), which is responsible for the receptor binding of BoHVs was our main target (Gabev et al., 2009). In addition, recombinant BoHV-1 were generated for the expression of OvHV-2 glycoproteins. Summary 2010 Recombinant BoHV-1 expressing gD of type 5 (BoHV-1gD5) as well as BoHV-5gD1 (together with appropriate control viruses) were analyzed for in vitro and in vivo properties.In cell culture, gD5 provided an extended host range to the virus carrying it. It was therefore of interest to know, whether or not this property extended to the behavior of those viruses in the mouse model (Abril et al. 2004). Accordingly, mice were inoculated with those viruses and clinical outcome as well as tissue tropism of the viruses were analyzed. Interestingly, gD5 increased the virulence of the virus carrying it. However, it did not contribute to the spread of the virus to the brain. Accidentally, we recognized that both BoHV-1 and BoHV-5 targeted the adrenal gland of infected mice, where they replicated and caused necrosis. Interestingly, central nervous symptoms were observed with both viruses, albeit at different times post inoculation. These observations led to the hypothesis that both types of BoHV may advance from the adrenal gland to the CNS. It will be most interesting to follow up on this possibility. In an idependent series of experiments, several recombinant BoHV-1 were made, which harbored glycoprotein genes from OvHV-2 in the place of their original orthologs. Among others, gH and gL were deleted from BoHV-1 and and replaced by the OvHV-2 orthologs. In addition, OvHV-2-gB was expressed in the same virus. Unfortunately, these viruses proofed to be unable to replicate in MDBK cells. Akademischer Bericht 2010 Virologisches Institut 23 Universit\u00e4t and morphogenesis of alpha herpesviruses; http://www.research-projects.uzh.ch/p6937.htm Cryobased transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM, SEM) shed new light on cell entry, envelopment and intracellular transport of alpha-herpesviruses. The data could be obtained because of the drastically enhanced spatial and temporal resolution of the applied techniques involving TEM, field emission SEM, and confocal microscopy. Aims The purpose of the present work is to study mechanisms of intracellular transport, morphogenesis, and envelopment of herpesviruses by using viral radioactive labeled compounds, electron microscopy employing cryotechniques, confocal microscopy, and labeled viral and cellular compartments. Summary 2010 During the past few years we gained strong evidence that envelopment of alpha herpes viruses follows two diverse pathways designated nuclear pathway and cytoplasmic pathway. In the nuclear pathway, capsids bud at the inner nuclear membranes acquiring envelope and tegument. The enveloped virions are assumed to be transported via RER cisternae to the Golgi complex where they are packaged into vacuoles for transportation to the cell periphery for exocytotic release. In the cytoplasmic pathway, naked nucleocapsids are assumed to exit the nucleus via dilated nuclear pores. Capsids approach the Golgi complex at the cytoplasmic side. There they bud at Golgi membranes leading to formation of the viral envelope and concomitantly to transport vacuoles for transportation to the cell periphery. To elucidate export of capsids the nuclear periphery was investigated employing high resolution microscopic techniques. Cryo-field emission SEM showed for the first time budding viruses at the nuclear surface and revealed dilation of nuclear pores. through which capsids can escape as shown by TEM (Wild, Senn et al. 2009). Studies of phospholipid metabolism showed that de novo synthesized phospholipids are incorporated into nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes, which become part of the viral envelope. Deletion of Us3, a protein kinase, led to alteration of phospholipid synthesis, and prevented dilation of nuclear pores whereas deletion of gG, a glycoprotein resulted in enhanced breakdown of Golgi membranes. Zusammenfassung auf Deutsch Das Genom der Mittels hochaufl\u00f6sender Transmissions- u n d R konnten of swine influenza virus infections in Switzerland; http://www.research-projects.uzh.ch/p4852.htm Summary / Zusammenfassung The occurrence of direct transmission of avian influenza to humans and the recent appearence of the pandemic swine influenza\" virus obviously demonstrate the significance of animal influenza infections for humans. The national influenza center (NZI) in Geneva (former head: Dr. W. Wunderli) had therefore initiated a programme of influenza surveillance in animals in 2001, in parallel to the one for human influenza. The surveillance of swine influenza infections in Switzerland is supported by the Federal Office of Health and the Federal Office of Veterinary Medicine. Aim Suspected cases of swine influenza are examined by real-time PCR and by attempts of virus isolation. Isolates are characterized to identify the subtypes of influenza viruses circulating in the Swiss swine population. The data shall be put into relation with the human influenza epidemics. If possible, swab samples should also be collected from sick swine farmers or family members, and analyzed at the NZI. Collaborations have been established also with the National Reference Center for Poultry and Rabbit Diseases (NRGK; Prof. Dr. R. Hoop) and with the Institute of Virology and Immunoprophylaxis (IVI) in Mittelh\u00e4usern, both responsible for avian influenza virus diagnostics, in order to exchange tools and data, e.g. in context with rapid and specific diagnosis tools and for differentiation of subtypes. Results in 2010 Nasal swabs were collected by practitioners in swine farms with pigs showing influenza-like symptoms, and lung samples were sent to our institute by pathologists. A total of 236 nasal swab and 2 lung samples from 84 swine farms of various geographical location were analyzed. The samples were tested by a paninfluenza PCR\" based on the matrix protein gene. A total of 115 nasal swab samples from 51 farms were found PCR positive. Due to the actual occurrence of the pandemic H1N1 virus infection in humans also in Switzerland, the positive samples were additionally tested with a real-time PCR specific for this virus, adapted from a protocol established by the Robert-Koch Institute, Berlin. No pandemic H1N1 strains were found in pigs. Subtyping was conducted by PCRs specific for the consensus sequences of the H1, N1, H3 and N2 genes of swine influenza virus (SIV) strains circulating in Europe, according to Chiapponi et al. (4th International Symposium on Emerging and Re-emerging Pig Diseases, Rome 29th June-2nd July, 2003). Samples from 35 swine farms were of H1N1 or at least N1 subtype. No sample tested was positive for H3 or N2. The sequence of the PCR products of the H1N1 isolates showed an identity of 95-99% on the nucleotide level with Italian, Spanish, German and French SIV strains isolated mainly in the years 2002-2008, confirming the circulation of common\" European H1N1 strains in the Swiss swine population. Despite some positive reactions in a PCR specific for the pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus, whole segment sequencing showed no differences to the common\" swine influenza virus strains. In addition, nasal swab samples of 14 persons from 14 farms have been analyzed at the NZI. Only one person, a swine farmer, was tested positive for a seasonal influenza A virus. The pigs of this farm were shown to be infected by a common\" swine H1N1 influenza virus. By whole segment sequence comparisons of the human and the pig isolates it was possible to demonstrate that the farmer has been infected with the swine influenza virus (publication in preparation). Akademischer Bericht 2010 Virologisches Institut 25 Universit\u00e4t Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland; http://www.research-projects.uzh.ch/p4851.htm Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) is an infection of cattle caused by the bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1). Since Switzerland had eradicated this infection rigorously, the country is free from IBR since the 1990ies. Nevertheless, a surveillance is important due to possible re-introduction of the infection from abroad. Several new cases have been detected in the course of the years. For this reason a simple clustering system, based on restriction enzyme analysis, had been established that allows the direct comparison of a new isolate with a collection of IBR strains from all over the world, in order to trace back the origin of the virus (S. Wyss, Vet.med. thesis, Z\u00fcrich, 2001). This system has been used at several occasions. For example, in 2005 IBR seropositive cattle imported from France had been detected. The isolated virus was a subtype BoHV-1.1 strain with great similarities to other known European IBR virus strains. In 2007 our strain collection could be enlarged by an IBR strain from Cuba. In 2009 a new case of IBR outbreak occurred in the Canton of Jura. Analysis of isolates from two dexamethasone treated animals using the clustering system revealed a high similarity of the new isolates to previous BoHV-1.1 isolates from the canton of Jura, as well as to the 2005 French BoHV-1 isolate. Thus one can speculate that the virus either has been introduced from neighbouring France or was the result of the reactivation of a persisting latent infection. Results 2010: In this period no further IBR outbreaks were noticed. In context with the 2009 outbreak we also had collected trigeminal ganglia from two seropositive animals from a second farm involved. No BoHV-1 DNA could be detected by means of real-time PCR. Akademischer Bericht 2010 Virologisches Institut 26 Universit\u00e4t novel herpesviruses in zoo and wildlife animals; http://www.research-projects.uzh.ch/p11495.htm Summary / Zusammenfassung The family Herpesviridae comprises a large number of potential pathogens that are widespread in humans and a broad range of animals. Herpesviruses are known to persist lifelong in the organism after a primary infection. The usual sites of latent infections are neurons of sensory ganglia and/or lymphocytes. To investigate which genera of herpesviruses are present in zoo and wildlife animals, veterinarians as well as pathologists were asked to send samples to our institute. DNA extracted from the samples is being analyzed by a panherpesvirus PCR according to Ehlers et al. (1999), and PCR products are sequenced (Mycrosynth, Balgach, CH) and compared to existing herpesvirus sequences by BLAST analysis. Results 2010 A total of 80 samples were analyzed, involving ibex, chamoix, bison, buffalo, antelopes, giraffe, rhino, monkeys, lions, zebra, Przewalski horses, as well as birds like flamingo, owl and magpie goose. A hitherto unknown herpesvirus was found in flamingo, which had been tested for herpesviruses due to foot lesions with unknown etiology. Since the virus was only found in 3 of 26 animals tested, the probability of a role of this herpesvirus as etiologic agent is very low. A second unknown herpesvirus was detected in a maneless zebra which was clinically normal. In addition, without a clinical context, lymphocryptoviruses were found in macaques and a chimpanzee, hippotragine and springbok herpesvirus 1 in sable antelope and springbok, respectively, equid herpesvirus 2 in Przewalski bisons. Interestingly, caprine herpesvirus more often in Alpine ibex with broncho-interstitial pneumonia compared to healthy controls. Further studies are needed to uncover the role of this virus in the etiology of the disease. Akademischer Bericht 2010 Virologisches Institut 27 Universit\u00e4t Z\u00fcrich of dendritic cells; http://www.research-projects.uzh.ch/p11476.htm Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most important antigen presenting cells of the immune system, as they are crucial for the initiation of T cell responses. The interaction between DCs and T cells can result in different forms of immune responses: tolerance or immunity. In the thymus, DCs are essential for inducing tolerance to newly generated T cells; in the periphery, DCs have a central role in maintaining tolerance to self-antigens and in driving effector immune responses agai nst t um ors and pathogens. Currently, DCs are classified in subpopulations based on the pattern of a limited number of specific cellular surface molecules. However, the functional characterization of DCs, based exclusively on these cellular markers, has proven difficult and controversial. For example, CD8+ DCs can be found in both thymus and peripheral lymphoid organs but these cells may originate from different precursors and paths of development. Aim (i) To functionally characterize and compare DCs from different lymphoid organs. (ii) To understand the factors influencing the DCs to \"choose\" between two converse immune responses, tolerance and immunity. (iii) To establish strategies for gene-/immuno-therapy of autoimmune diseases. DC Biology We have established the methodology to isolate DCs from thymus and spleen with a minimum of cell activation due to ex vivo manipulation. When comparing cross-presentation capacity of DCs from a same sub-population isolated from thymus and spleen, we found that DCs from thymus are much more efficient in antigen presentation than their splenic counterparts. Splenic DCs had to be activated ex vivo to reach the degree of T cell stimulation capacity provided by their unstimulated thymic equivalents. Gene/Immunotherapy of autoimmune diseases The cause of multiple sclerosis (MS) is unknown and the pathogenic processes leading to disease development is incompletely understood. Current knowledge supports a T cell mediated autoimmune pathogenesis targeting myelin components or myelin-producing cells. Immunization of susceptible animals with myelin antigens or transfer of myelin antigen-reactive T cells induces experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an inflammatory disorder of the CNS which closely resembles MS. Because the ethiology of MS is not yet completely understood, there is no curative treatment available at present. The aim of this project is to induce permanent, antigen-specific tolerance in EAE/MS. The strategy includes the ex vivo modification of autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) with viral vectors that express antigens involved in EAE/MS from a dendritic cell-specific promoter. After re-infusion, the modified HSC will give rise to all cells of the immune system including antigen expressing dendritic cells. We hypothesized that the antigen presentation by these cells in thymus and periphery in a non-inflammatory condition would tolerize self-reactive T cells and, therefore, prevent/revert disease development. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this strategy for inducing myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-tolerance in an EAE model in mice. All mice which received HSC transduced with the MOG-expressing vector were protected from EAE upon immunization (clinical score 0), while 100% of mice that received BM cells transduced with a mock control vector developed EAE. By histological analysis, we could detect demyelination and extensive inflammation in brain, spinal cord and optical nerve from control diseased mice, but not in treated mice. We also show that tolerance was generated by efficient deletion of MOG specific T cells in chimeras that received HSC transduced with the MOG-expressing lentivirus vector. In addition, Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) were generated, although the importance of t h e s e c e l l s i n prevention of EAE development has to be further addressed. Akademischer Bericht 2010 Virologisches Institut 28 Universit\u00e4t Z\u00fcrich Analysis of the molecular composition of AAV replication compartments; http://www.research-projects.uzh.ch/p8257.htm Many viruses including adenoviruses and HSV-1 replicate at discrete intranuclear sites called replication compartments. As discussed in the previous project, AAV also establishes discrete replication compartments, but productive replication depends on the presence of a helper virus, such as adenovirus, papillomavirus, or HSV-1. Interestingly, the helper factors provided by the different viruses have diverse functions, but are still able to create an intracellular environment that supports AAV replication. primase complex), and ICP8 (ssDNA binding protein), which are sufficient to support AAV replication, are directly involved in DNA replication. Some of the adenovirus proteins implicated in AAV replication appear to have more indirect roles in AAV replication by enhancing second-strand synthesis of the AAV genome and activation of the p5 promoter. While HSV-1 replication compartments are well characterized, not many cellular components of productive AAV replication compartments a r e k n o w n . T h e d e t a i l e d a n a l y s i s o f t h e c o m p o s i t i o n o f these sites of AAV replication and their interactions with HSV-1 replication compartments would yield new information on the interactions between competing origins of DNA replication and would help to design innovative gene therapy vectors that exploit genetic elements from different viruses. Aim To functionally analyze the composition of AAV replication compartments and their interaction with helper virus replication compartments. We have analyzed the role of cellular DNA replication/repair proteins in HSV-1 assisted AAV replication. Using cell lines with deficiencies in the main kinases in DNA repair, ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs, we have elucidated the DNA damage signaling pathways in cells co-infected with AAV and HSV-1. We also addressed the question whether AAV can modulate HSV-1 induced DNA damage responses, which include activation of ATM and ATR kinases. While ATM and ATR are activated in HSV-1 infected cells, the third main kinase in DNA damage signalling, DNA-PKcs, is degraded. Western blot and immunfluorescence analyses revealed that AAV can modulate the HSV-1 mediated degradation of DNA-PKcs and induction of ATM. DNA-Pkcs degradation appeared to be delayed and ATM induction reduced in cells co-infected with both viruses. These effects also affected signaling to downstream targets, including RPA, Chk1, Chk2, and p53. We will now analyze the consequences these interactions have on the replication of the two viruses. We have also examined cell cycle arrest in cells infected with either AAV or HSV-1 alone, or co-infected with both viruses. These results indicate a direct link between the modulation of the HSV-1 induced cellular DNA damage response by AAV and the AAV/HSV-1 induced cell cycle arrest. Akademischer Bericht 2010 collaborative project involving four academic laboratories from fourEuropean countries (France, Switzerland, Germany, Italy) and four academic laboratoriesbelonging to three South American countries (Argentine, Brazil, Uruguay). The overallscientific goal of HEVAR is to contribute to a better understanding of the immune biology ofrotavirus infections using a novel generation of gene transfer vectors derived from herpessimplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), as a first step towards the development of innovative genetic vaccines to fight against these pathogens, which are the most common cause of severe dehydrating diarrhoea in young children of developing countries. In addition to contributing to a better understanding of the immune biology of rotavirus infection and of evaluating the feasibility of using HSV-1 vectors as anti-rotavirus vaccines, the main deliverables of HEVAR will be a set of toolboxes containing a large collection of HSV-1-based and DNA-based vectors expressing human and mouse rotavirus antigens that will be evaluated in mice, which will be rendered accessible to any academic team wishing to use them for vaccine development or fundamental research on rotaviruses. A last set of deliverables will consist in a series of scientific meetings and events required to achieve the transfer of knowledge and complex technology required to generate, produce, and evaluate, the HSV-1-based gene transfer vectors in South America, therefore improving the human capital and the technological competence of these countries. In addition, the transfer from South American partners to European teams of up-to-date knowledge on the biology of rotavirus and other endemic viruses, with high social cost in South America, will strength the awareness to-, and a better understanding of-, these neglected diseases. Aim (i) To develop HSV-1-based vectors for t h e g e n e ra t i on a n d a n a l y s i s o f r ot a v i r u s-specific expression and display model vaccines. (ii) To evaluate the ability of these vectors to elicit protective immune responses against rotavirus infection in normal and transgenic mice. (iii) To elucidate the contribution of individual rotavirus antigens and of different components of the immune system to the architecture of the immune response and to protection upon rotavirus challenge in animal models. Summary 2010 We have constructed and characterized herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) amplicon vectors expressing rotavirus structural genes individually or in combination (VP2, VP4, VP6 and VP7). The vector stocks were prepared using a helper virus-free packaging system. Vector-mediated expression of the different virus genes in transduced mammalian cells was analyzed and expression of VP2, VP6 and VP7 was confirmed by Western blot and immune fluorescence. However, electron microscopy analyses did not reveal the formation of rotavirus like particles in the vector-infected cells. Amplicon vector stocks expressing one or multiple rotavirus genes were used to immunize mice in the laboratories of our collaborators in Munich and Buenos Aires. In summary, the vectors induced efficient humoral and cellular, rotavirus specific responses. The induction of immune reponses was dependent on de novo synthesized rotavirus gene products as inactivated vector particles did not induce any significant responses. Akademischer Bericht 2010 Virologisches Institut 30 Universit\u00e4t Z\u00fcrich Mechanisms of interaction between alternative and competing viral replication origins.; http://www.research-projects.uzh.ch/p4833.htm Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and adeno-associated virus (AAV) are taxonomically unrelated viruses with distinct biological properties. HSV-1 is a large, double-stranded DNA virus that remains extrachromosomally in the infected cell nucleus. AAV is a small, single-stranded DNA virus which can integrate into a specific site, designated AAVS1, on chromosome 19 in human cells. Yet, HSV-1 and AAV also interact with each other as AAV replication depends on helper functions provided by HSV-1. Gene delivery vectors based on HSV-1 or AAV have both advantageous properties but also major limitations. To combine the advantageous components of both parent viruses and exclude their disadvantages, we have developed a hybrid HSV/AAV vector. We have demonstrated that HSV/AAV hybrid vectors can be packaged into HSV-1 virions, thereby exploiting the large transgene capacity of HSV-1. Moreover, upon infection of human cells, the hybrid vector genome directs the integration of transgenes into AAVS1, a function conserved from its AAV parent. However, we have observed that the AAV rep gene inhibits HSV-1 DNA replication, which drastically reduces the titers of HSV/AAV hybrid vectors, compared to that of standard HSV-1 amplicons. Aim To investigate the molecular mechanisms of interaction between HSV-1 and AAV, in particular the mechanisms of AAV-mediated inhibition of HSV-1 replication. Previous research in our laboratory demonstrated that the AAV replication protein Rep inhibits HSV-1 replication at the level of DNA replication (Glauser et al., J. Virology, 2007). However, the molecular mechanisms of this inhibition remain largely unknown. The AAV Rep78 protein contains five main activities, specifically: DNA-binding, ATPase/helicase, endonuclease, and for inhibition of HSV-1, we performed a mutational analysis of AAV Rep78. We demonstrate that inhibition of HSV-1 replication requires the DNA-binding- and ATPase/helicase activities in cis, while both the endonuclease activity and the C-terminus of Rep78, containing zinc-finger and PKI-like motifs are dispensable. Replication assays further demonstrated that Rep-mediated inhibition occurred at or prior to the stage of DNA replication. Of an initial set of Rep mutants tested, all those that supported AAV replication inhibited HSV-1 replication, while those that did not inhibit HSV-1 replication failed to support AAV replication, which absolutely requires the DNA binding, endonuclease, and helicase activities. Interestingly, the domains/activities responsible for HSV-1 inhibition, in particular DNA binding and helicase, perfectly coincided with the activities responsible for Rep-induced apoptosis. However, we found that prevention of Rep-induced apoptosis by caspase inhibitors did not prevent Rep-mediated inhibition of HSV-1 replication, indicating that the execution of apoptosis is not required for the negative effect of AAV Rep on HSV-1 replication. The data rather suggest that Rep-mediated inhibition of HSV-1 acts upstream in the pathway leading to Rep-induced apoptosis. We have addressed two possible mechanisms which could contribute to the obstruction of HSV-1 replication by AAV: (i) the Rep78 induced cellular DNA damage response and (ii) the Rep78 mediated reduction of HSV-1 immediate early and early gene expression. Surprisingly neither of these mechanisms appeared to b e responsible for the inhibition of HSV-1 repliaction (Glauser et al, 2010). This finding together with the observation that DNA-binding and ATPase/Helicase activities needed to be combined on one Rep molecule corroborate the hypothesis that the AAV Rep proteins directly interact with HSV-1 DNA replication. We have recently demonstrated that AAV Rep can indeed bind to several consensus Rep binding sites on the HSV-1 genome. This interaction with the helpervirus genome may result in the inefficient replication of the Bericht 2010 Virologisches delivery; http://www.research-projects.uzh.ch/p11475.htm This laboratory has a long-standing interest in the development of HSV-1 vectors and their application in Gene- a n d C a n c e r T h e r a p y . W e h a v e d e v e l o p e d h e l p e r v i r u s-free HSV-1 amplicon vectors and HSV/AAV hybrid vectors, and we have used these vectors for the delivery of many different transgenes into a wide variety of cells in culture and in vivo. Aims (i) To study the molecular mechanisms of virus replication and virus-cell-interaction. (ii) To develop novel HSV-1-based vector systems for application in gene- and cancer-therapy. Summary 2010 We have constructed a recombinant HSV-1 vector (using the oncolytic recombinant HSV-1 vector MGH2 as a backbone) that contains an AAV ITR-flanked transgene cassette and expresses the AAV repD (see project 4833) and cap genes (rHSV/rAAV-repD). As HSV-1 delivers dsDNA we hypothesiszed that the AAV ITR-flanked transgene cassette would be rescued from the HSV-1 genome, replicated and packaged into AAV virions. Indeed, infection of cells with rHSV/rAAV-repD resulted in the in situ production of AAV particles as demonstrated by electron microscopy. This novel rHSV/rAAV hybrid vector system combines the advantages of replicationdefective and replicationcompetent viruses and, in addition, it allows in situ amplification and spread of the transgene sequences. The next aim will be to replace the mCherry reporter gene on rHSV/rAAV-repD with the anti-angiogenesis genes BalI or VEGF-R. The U94 gene of human herpes virus 6, which is a structural and functional homologue of the AAV rep gene, has recently been demonstrated to have strong anti-angiogenesis activity (Caruso et al., 2009). The AAV repD gene present on rHSV/rAAV-repD may therefore further enhance the anti-angiogenesis effect of BalI or VEGF-R. Akademischer Bericht 2010 der Haus- u n d N u t z t i e r e .
