Meanwhile, indebtedness symbolises an unpleasant mental state which is also triggered by benefit receipts (Greenberg, 1980). Theories and empirical evidence in the literature have highlighted how gratitude and indebtedness each relates to prosociality (or sanctioning ), and importantly, how via different routes these two constructs will elicit cooperativeness. Nonetheless, there is still a gap in the literature on how gratitude and indebtedness will contribute to prosociality and sanctioning in economic exchanges (Leung, 2011). Thus via three e conomic games (i.e. Experiments 1 to 3, presented in Chapters 2 to 5) I endeavour to thoroughly examine how gratitude (and indebtedness ) would relate to prosociality or sanctioning in a Behavioural Economics context. In so doing I intend to combine Psychometrics and Experimental Economics in the examination of the gratitude (and indebtedness )-prosociality association. Additionally, via meta -analysing (i.e. Chapter 2) over three decades of research on the gratitude -prosociality link I intend to offer i) a comprehensive quantitative synthesis of the findings and, ii) a systematic exploration of moderators, which are both absent in the literature. The present thesis also features a series of extensive follow -up analyses on an interesting economic obser vation from Experiment 1 \u2014 i.e. the cheap - rider problem (Cornes & Sandler, 1984). While Experiment 2 entails a more focused scrutiny (via a one-shot game) over the occurrences and motives behind cheap -riding, Experiment 3 builds on that by testing how cheap -riding may be used to enforce normative fairness in an iterated exchange context. Preface iii Results of the meta -analysis revealed a moderate positive link between gratitude and prosociality . The moderator analyses showed that this link is stronger when, a) state rather than trait gratitude was measured, b) direct instead of indirect or non-reciprocal outcomes was examined, and c) benefit - triggered instead of generali zed gratitude (Lambert et al., 2009) was examined. Meanwhile, results of Experiment 1 built upon the above by showing how the gratitude -reciprocity link will be subject to helper intent attribution, and how the injunctive fairness norm (Elster, 2006) could influence this attribution and thereby shaped reci pients' feeling of gratitude (or indebtedness ) throughout the episode, and ultimately his/her urge to directly reciprocate. Additionally, a noticeable degree of cheap -riding was observed when unfairly treated participants were granted an avenue to sanction their helpers. The data of Experiment 2 revealed a pattern of cheap -riding that corresponded not only to that of Experiment 1 but also to the reality. Crucially, the analyses of the motives behind repayment allowed the disentanglement of the psychology between that of the cheap -riders , cooperators , and free-riders . Lastly, analyses of Experiment 3 revealed three main findings. They included, a) people's preference for an 'optimal' platform for cheap -riding to better serve its norm -enforcing function, alt hough its actual efficacy in promoting mutual compliance to normative fairness is still questionable; b) how the Relative Rank Model of Gratitude (Wood, Brown, & Maltby, 2011) will supersede the injunctive fairness norm in guiding the recipients' benefit appraisals, experienced gratitude , and eventual direct reciprocal acts toward the helpers; and c) how gratitude and indebtedness were both predictive of more trustworthiness and generosity in an iterated , variant of Trust Game. Preface iv Acknowledgement There are so many individuals without whom this PhD thesis may not have been completed, and for that they have my eternal gratitude. First, I would like to thank my two supervisors. Professor Eamonn Ferguson, my principal supervisor, was one of the few to show interest in taking me as his pupil. Professor Ferguson is always responsive, professional, inspirational and extremely helpful in our every exchange. In addition to his detailed, invaluable feedback for each of my written work, I thank Professor Ferguson also for always assuring me that I have been on the right track, even during the time when I was at a loss and stumbled a bit across the finishing line. Dr Richard Tunney, my secondary supervisor, is always insightful, to -the-point, and never hesitant to offer his constructive, no -nonsense appraisal. It is truly an honour to be mentored by both of you. I also take this opportunity to thank Dr Peter Bibby, my internal examiner for both my annual review and exit viva, for offering critical insights on my studies, and also astute statistical advice during our private consultations. I also thank Professor Alex Wood of the Stirling Management School for being my external examiner, his willingness to offer me advice every time we met during the conferences , and most importantly, his phenomenal work in the gratitude literature which inspires the present thesis. I also thank all my workmates here in Nottingham, especially the B60ers \u2014Dr Alexandra Turcan, Dr Fabio Parente and Beerelim Corona, and the Personality , Social Psychology, and Health (PSPH) research group including (and certainly not limited to) Dr Anya Skatova, Dr Kathleen Baess, Klive Bierer, Natalia Stanulewicz, and Alex Bradley. Thank you all for putting up Preface v with me throughout. It has been a privilege knowing you all and needless to say, having you all contributing to my project massively without knowing. I intend to also give a special shout -out to the Yeung's family ( Mr Miles M. Yeung and Ms Claudia W. Au-yeung and their two little darlings), who took me in like their little brother when I first stepped foot into England five years ago. Though they may be too humble and noble to acknowledge that, my journey would be way more lacklustre without their frie ndships, constant bantering, occasional get -togethers...and the list goes on and on. Allow me to also express my gratitude toward my friends back home, including (and certainly not limited to) Dennis Liu, Ronald Cheng, Chelsea Lin, Paul Chan, Sara Li, Cher ry Wong, and Hoi -wah Ng. Thank you for bailing me out without knowing and for making this journey of mine worth remembering. Of course, this PhD would never have been embarked without the financial and emotional support of my parents and my sister. I a m eternally blessed by and appreciative of their confidence in a de fiant kid five years ago when nobody bothered sparing him one glance. They had always been there assuring that I feel valued, loved and that I am never on my own in this marathon. My specia l thanks also goes to my sister Alison for her magnificent job attending to her family (well how could I forget the two angelic little princesses Ava Louise and Justine Joan), her profession as an elite paediatrician, and also to our parents when I was hal f a globe away pursuing this PhD. Finally, I thank the University of Nottingham, and the School of Psychology, for granting me this very opportunity to pursue a PhD and also the resources to support my training and to expand my horizons as a researcher.

Overall Objective of the Current Thesis The current thesis concerns the detailed role of gratitude \u2014an emotion that arises when people receive an undeserved benefit ( Bertocci & Millard, 1963) attributable to someone else's benign intent (Emmons, 2004; Watkins, 2007) \u2014in relat ion to prosociality and sanctioning in a behavioural economics (i.e. BE hereafter) context. In particular, I examined \u2014via an iterated and two one-shot variant of Trust Game \u2014how gratitude , as a transitory state or as an enduring disposition , will facilitate people's reciprocal (as opposed to sanctioning ) decisions in situations under which pursuit of self -gain will clash with maximization of collective benefits (Allison, Beggan, & Midgley, 1996). Another objective of the current thesis is to dissociate the mechanisms through which gratitude and indebtedness \u2014an unpleasant mental state triggered by benefit receipts (Goei & Boster, 2005; Greenberg, 1980) \u2014prompts positive and negative reciprocity (Fehr & Falk, 1999) in a BE context. I also examined the importance of intention and injunctive norm on fostering gratitude or indebtedness, and how these may eventually contribute to one's economic decision making. Furthermore, a meta -analytic review over the link between gratitude and prosociality was included. Via this review I aimed to provide an overall estimate on how strongly gratitude relates to prosociality, and also what other issues might mould the strength of this association. Leung (2011) argued that there is a pauci ty of empirical works which specifically investigated how gratitude engenders cooperation in economic exchanges . Indeed, despite a plethora of psychological research (e.g. Froh al, 2014; Halali, prosociality link, only a few had outright examined prosociality in an economic Chapter 1 3 exchange (e.g. Desteno, Bartlett, Baumann, Williams, & Dickens, 2010; Exline & Hill, 2012; Rubin, 2012). Even worse, indebtedness is an overlooked topic in the BE literatur e despite its theoretical connectedness with direct reciprocity (Greenberg & Shapiro, 1971; Watkins, Scheer, Ovnicek, & Kolts, 2006) and sanctioning Whitcher -Alagna, 1983; Greenberg & Westcott, 1983; Hatfield & Sprecher, 1983). To date, there is still a total absence of published articles which directly scrutinised the effect of indebtedness \u2014as an aversive psychological state or a disposition (Mathews & Green, 2010; Mathews & Shook, 2013) \u2014in economic exchanges. Thus, one intended maj or contribution of the current thesis is to combine psychometrics and Behavioural Economics in scrutini sing the role of gratitude and indebtedness in nurturing (or undermining) cooperation and sanctioning. Meanwhile, an injunctive norm represents a cluster of expectations on what a typical person should do in a given situation to warrant social approval (Burger et al., 2010; Cialdini, Kallgren, & Reno, 1990; Perkins, 2003). Bicchieri (2006) argued that when evaluating someone else's intent people will base their judgment upon whether the injunctive norm was upheld. Thus, injunctive norm forms the basis of fairness judgment and this notion has been evidenced in the social psychology, social cooperation, and social learning literature (e.g. Hoffman, McCabe, & Smith, 1996; Irving & Simpson, 2013; Kazemi, Eek, & G\u00e4rling, 2016). Nevertheless, it still remains unaddressed as of how such a norm -based judgment would tamper with people's experience of gratitude , or indebtedness , and crucially, how these might contribu te to one's actual decisions to reciprocate or to sanction in an economic interaction. Chapter 1 4 Moreover, in spite of the host of empirical (e.g. Tsang, 2006a, 2007) and theoretical evidence (e.g. Algoe, Haidt, & Gable, 2008; McCullough, Kilpatrick, Emmons, & Larson, 2001; McCullough & Tsang, 2004; Roberts, 2004) for gratitude -prosociality link, there is still a lack of a comprehensive quantitative review of these findings. Given the overarching aim of this thesis concerns the analyses of how gratitude will enhance prosociality in a specific context (i.e. a BE setting), it is of utmost importance to examine if there is a reliable and consistent association between gratitude and prosoc iality for starters, and also what methodological or theoretical factors may account for any inconsistencies of the effect estimates across the sampled studies. Taken together, I believe that the current thesis should bridge a gap in the literature by ill ustrating 1) how gratitude and indebtedness , would \u2014 potentially in a different fashion (See Schaumberg and Flynn (2009) for a review) \u2014influence one's intention or actual cooperation or sanctioning in a BE context; 2) how the injunctive norm , and its effect on fairness perception, will affect one's gratitude or indebtedness and consequently guide that individual's decision to cooperate or sanction; and lastly, 3) how gratitude relates to prosociality and what other factors could have moderated this link. Below (i.e. Section 1.1) I discuss the theoretical build -ups of the present thesis. That includes a range of theories and models of cooperation and altruism, so as the role of positive and negative emotions in these cooperation (or sanctioning) models. Secti on 1.1 also entails a review of the evidence in the Social Psychology and Experimental Economics literature that pertains to the gratitude -prosociality association. The present chapter is at last wrapped up by Chapter 1 5 a few basic predictions and hypotheses, which are then followed by a preview of Chapters 2 to 5 which present the meta -analysis and Experiments 1 to 3. 1.1. Cooperation and Altruism Revisited 1.1.1. Sanctioning and Cooperation The effect of sanctioning on cooperation maintenance is well documented in the experimental economics literature (See Fehr and Rockenbach (2004) for a review). Particularly, it is argued that to enforce the norm of cooperation it is imperative that one should penali se norm violators for victimi sing a third party (Bendor & Swista k, 2001), i.e., altruistic 'third -party' punishment (Landman & Hess, 2016; Nelissen & Zeelenberg, Indeed, data of Fehr and Fischbacher's (2004) third -party punishment game illustrated that 55% of the spectators would punish, in spite of a cost to themselves, people for refusing to apportion a fair share of endowment to their co-players. Also, nearly 80 % of participants will anticipate the third -parties (i.e. the spectators) to intervene via sanctioning their partners if they were not playing fair. These implied that there should be a consensus of zero tolerance toward norm violators, and crucially, an e xpectation of these perpetrators to get their comeuppances even if punishing them may not be utterly cost -free. Additionally, G\u00fcrerk, Irlenbusch, and Rockenbach (2004, 2006) demonstrated, via their iterated public goods game, that there was a shift in preference from a sanctioning -free (SFI hereafter) to a sanctioning institution (SI hereafter) as the game proceeded. Participants will decide before the start of each trial whether they preferred the SFI\u2014in which players could not penali se one another, or th e SI\u2014 in which sanctioning non -cooperation was feasible. Chapter 1 6 Indeed, not only had their data revealed a near extinction of preferences for SFI in the later experimental phases, G\u00fcrerk et al. (2006) also showed that the contributions were significantly larger among players who picked the SI. Thus, the results of G\u00fcrerk et al. (2004, 2006) again pointed to the fact that people do subscribe to the idea that sanctioning (or the threat of which) is instrumental in safeguarding mutual cooperation, and importantly, t he data further corroborated the potency of sanctioning in nurturing cooperation . Nevertheless, a few questions remain unanswered: Does sanctioning alone already suffice to guarantee mutual cooperation? What other factors may as well influence the efficac y of sanctioning in preventing defection? 1.1.2. Intent Attribution, Reciprocity Model, and Emotion 1.1.2.1. Sanctioning No Panacea to Maintenance of Cooperation To address the above questions Fehr and associates (Fehr & Rockenbach, 2003; Fehr & List, 200 4) examined the downside of unfair , unreasonable sanctioning on cooperation maintenance via a series of modified Trust Games (i.e. TG hereafter). In these modified TGs Fehr and associates had granted a portion of the investors the option to fine their trustees for back - transfers ( BTs) that fell short of the investors' 'desired BTs' (i.e. the 'Incentive Condition'). Investors could hand -pick their own 'desired BTs' and were under no pressure to impose any fine if they deemed unnecessary. As such, the experim enters examined if a selfishly -driven sanctioning arrangement, in which an investor demanded an unreasonably high back -transfer while threatened to sanction, would rather encourage (but not undermine ) non -cooperation. The data confirmed this hypothesis by showing that unfair sanctioning overall haunted a trustee's compliance. Specifically, unfairly treated trustees Chapter 1 7 would rather pay the penalty charges than complying with their investors' selfish demands. By contrast, trustees whose investors chose not resort to the punishment threat \u2014even when they could \u2014demonstrated more trustworthiness (in the form of proportionately higher BTs), than trustees i) who were threatened to not under -repay; and those ii) whose trustors could not penali se. These showed that when one decides whether to cooperate he/she does not just reflexively respond to the sanctioning parameters, he/she also ponders over whether the arrangement comprises moral legitimacy or it reflects malicious intent on behalf of the enforcers (Fehr & Rockenb ach, 2003). In short, a lack of perceived negativity (e.g. unfairness and animosity), or the presence of perceived kindness (e.g. trust and respect), is also instrumental in the preservation of mutual cooperation (McCabe, Rigdon & Smith, 2003). 1.1.2.2. Intent Perception and Reciprocities Fehr and colleagues' observations are indeed consistent with the Theory of Reciprocity (Falk & Fischbacher, 2006) which asserts that reciprocation (or retaliation) will depend on a recipient's evaluation of helper's inte nt. Charness and Levine (2007) even argued that intent perception could override actual distributive outcomes in predicting positive or negative reciprocity, as their data showed that when individuals decided whether to remunerate or to sanction they tend to prioritise the evaluation of the intentionality of the outcomes. Fehr and Falk (1999) argued that reciprocity comprises both cooperation and sanctioning. While Positive Reciprocity arises from an urge to 'reward actions perceived as generous, kind or fair (pp.109)', Negative Reciprocity is driven by a desire to sanction behaviours deemed 'hostile or unfair (pp.109).' Additionally, Greenberg and Westcott (1983) suggested that emotion may Chapter 1 8 mediate the link between intent attribution and reciprocation. They argued that a prosocial gesture which communicates good intentions \u2014on the benefactor's behalf \u2014should elicit positive emotions such as gratitude (Komter, 2004; Nadler, 2012), and these positive emotions should be conducive to reciprocation (Fredrickson, 2004a; McCullough et al., 2001; Tsang, 2007). Nowak and Roch (2007) highlighted the role of positive affects \u2014while emphasi sing gratitude \u2014in triggering and sustaining both the direct and indirect reciprocation. This resonates with Fredrickson's (2004a) Broaden -And-Build Theory in which gratitude could propel a beneficiary to act 'prosocially oneself , either towards one's benefactor, towards others, or both. (pp.150)' By contrast, a malic iously -intentioned act of ingratiation should elicit negative emotions such as indebtedness and annoyance in the recipients (Greenberg & Shapiro, 1971; Hatfield & Sprecher, 1983; Lazarus & Lazarus, 1996), and these negative emotions have been well -document ed to foster non - cooperation or even sanctioning (Ma et al., 2012; Xiao & Houser, 2005). Taken together, the above underlines the role of emotion in transforming intent attributions to the subsequent behavioural retaliation and reciprocation. Section 1.1. 3 further highlights how cooperation (or prosociality), thanks to its evolutionary origin, would depend upon emotions. 1.1.3. Cooperation as an Intuition Rand, Greene, and Nowak (2012) had referred to the Dual -process framework (Dijksterhuis & Nordgren, 2006; Kahneman, 2011) \u2014which theorise s one's social decision making as an outcome of interaction between Intuition (System 1) and Reflection (System 2) \u2014to ac count for the observed pattern of cooperation in various one -shot economic games (such as the PGs). Chapter 1 9 Their results identified a causal, direct link between processing speed and cooperation which suggests that one's 'automatic first response (pp.429)' is cooperation, and that selfishness only creeps into one's mind once that person can afford to be deliberative. As a result, Rand et al. (2012) argued that humans are predisposed to prosociality whereas rationality results from self -control. Rand et al. (2012) further theorise d that human beings develop the cooperative instinct in daily lives under which cooperation is advantageous; as the key interactions are repeated (Fudenberg & Maskin, 1986) and that cooperation are critical in reputation management (Pfeiff er, Tran, Krumme, & Rand, 2012; Rockenbach & Milinski, 2006; Milinski, 2016). These participants, when cornered into acting fast, might therefore just act on their altruistic 'defaults' even in a context in which cooperation is anything but advantageous (e.g. one -off exchanges with anonymous co -players in a laboratory). However, as the time pressure dissipates (which implies more room for reflection ), people can adapt to the context and therefore make a more calculated decision as they suppress their cooper ative heuristics (Rand et al., 2014; Jordan et al., 2014). Meanwhile, it is well documented (e.g. Kahneman, 2003, 2011) that the System 1 is characterised by automaticity, and more importantly, susceptibility to emotions . System 2, on the other hand, epit omises consciousness and emotionlessness. Taken together, the intuitive nature of prosociality should by default render cooperation an emotionally dependent concept. Indeed, the current thesis will particularly examine how emotions gratitude and indebtedness will relate to prosociality in the realm of economic exchanges. 1.2. Emotion, Altruism and Sanctioning Revisited Chapter 1 10 Section 1.1.2 discussed the importance of intent attributions and emotions from the recipients' perspective in shaping the two -part exchange \u2014 i.e. initial favour followed by reciprocation or retaliation \u2014between a benefactor and a recipient. Indeed, the emotional reactions of recipients used to be a scarcely researched topic in the Altruism literature until the 80s (See Fisher, Nadle r, & DePaulo, 1983; Gross & McMullen, 1983 for a review). Fisher (1983) attributed such an oversight to the oversimplified construal of a helper -recipient relationship. That is, all helping relationships were presumed to function uniformly and mechanistic ally insofar as the helpers deliver the needed resources, with little to none regards to recipients' reactions. As such, researchers were prone to take a helper -centred perspective when analysing a helper -recipient relationship (Fisher, 1983). In the follo wing , I discuss three helper -centred models that theori sed the different roles of a helper's positive and negative emotions will play in inciting prosociality. 1.2.1. Empathy -Altruism Hypothesis (i.e. EAH hereafter) Batson and associates (e.g. Batson al., 1989; Batson, & & Weeks, 1996) theori sed that empathic concern is the source of altruistic motivation. According to EAH, after witnessing the suffering of a needy person an empathic spectator would identif y with the former and also vicariously experience that suffering (Batson, 1991). Consequently, to relieve that sufferer of his/her misery \u2014via helping \u2014will become the top priority for the prospective helper because he/she feels for the former (Batson, 1990, 2010; Batson, Eklund, Chermok, Hoyt, & Ortiz, 2007). Nonetheless, it is important to note that this empathy -driven helping should have no association with self -gains such as avoidance of disapproval or Chapter 1 11 desire for social acclaim (Batson et al., 1988), con sidering that the helper's primary concern is to benefit the person toward whom empathy was felt (Batson et al., 1986; Batson et al., 1989). Indeed, the EAH epitomi ses what altruism comprises by definition: an unselfish or unconditional concern for others (Fehr & Schmidt, 2006), and an intention to enhance others' welfare without expecting any extrinsic rewards (Bar -Tal, 1986). The EAH had received extensive empirical support (e.g. Batson et al., 1988; Batson & 1986; Schroeder, Dovidio, Sibicky, Matthews, & Allen, 1988) despite the presence of a rival model \u2014i.e. Negative State Relief Model (i.e. NSRM hereafter) which argued that negative mood management is what truly underlies helping (Cialdini et a l., 1987; Cialdini & Fultz, 1990). Section 1.2.2 offers an overview of the NRSM. 1.2.2. Negative State Relief Model (NSRM) Despite acknowledging the importance of perspective -taking in inspiring helping, Cialdini and colleagues (e.g. Cialdini, Brown, Lewis , Luce, & Neuberg, 1997 ; Cialdini, Darby, & Vincent, 1973;) asserted that there is no such thing as a 'selfless' helping. That is, people, having witnessed the victim's suffering, are motivated to help by an egoistic objective to eradicate their own negati ve state. This Mood Management perspective of helping has been, for instance, evidenced in Cialdini et al.'s (1973) observed decline in helping among people who were given an alternative means to salvage their mood. Cialdini and colleagues (Cialdini et al . 1997; Goldstein & Cialdini, 2007; Maner et al. 2002) further questioned the EAH by stating that helping someone with whom one has a sense of merged identity hardly qualifies a 'selfless' demeanour. A helper who empathi ses with recipient prospective Chapter 1 12 recip ient is expected to have cultivated a sense of 'oneness' between the pair (Maner et al., 2002). Therefore, it is illogical to claim whatever attempts to help as genuinely selfless as the helper considers him/herself and the victim as a single entity . In pa rticular, Maner et al. (2002) revealed that once non -altruistic factors such as the helper's negative state and sense of merged identity with the victim had been controlled for, empathic concern was no longer correlated with helping. Nonetheless, the paths of 1) perceived merged identity and helping, and 2) negative state and helping both remained statistically significant, thereby further endorsing the NRSM and meanwhile dismissing the EAH. 1.2.3. Impure Altruism and Warm -Glow Giving \u2014the Integrative Model While EAH and NSRM constitute the polar opposites in the 'Egoism - Altruism debate' ( Batson, Ahmad, Lisner, & Tsang, 2002 ; Batson & Shaw, 1991), Andreoni's (1989, 1990, 1993) concept of Impure Al truism appeared to fall somewhere between these two extremes. An impure altruist (i.e. IA hereafter), according to Andreoni (1989, 1990), derives a joy of giving (Abel & Warshawsky, 1987; Ribar & Wilhelm, 2002) from 1) the fact that his/her altruistic act had contributed to the betterment of others, and crucially, 2) the sheer act of giving. Thus, apart from the benevolent concerns for the needy, impure altruists acquire a sense of 'warm -glow' (i.e. an internal satisfaction) (Beccheti & Degli Antoni, 2010; Harbaugh, 1998) via their prosocial acts. By contrast, a pure altruist (i.e. PA hereafter) helps purely out of their concern for others' welfare (Becker, 1974; Rose -Ackerman, 1997). This is indeed consistent with what EAH theori ses as the primary motivato r of helping (See Section 1.2.1). As such, PAs should be apathetic to the sources of help as long as the needy are taken care of, as PAs do not help out of the 'warm -glow' Chapter 1 13 feeling. To verify whether prosociality , especially in the form of charitable donat ions, is accountable by pure or impure altruism researchers examined a phenomenon termed 'crowding -out' (e.g. Kingma, 1989; Payne 1998, 2001). Crowding -out occurs when a donor reduces his/her contribution to a charity knowing that every dollar he/she dona tes will be matched with an equivalent withdrawal by an external agency (Abrams & Schmitz, 1984). Since PAs, by definition, should only be concerned about the total contribution, one should expect a complete crowding out whereby a dollar increase in extern al funding should induce exactly a dollar's drop in the private donation (Konow, 2010). On the contrary, an incomplete crowding -out can be anticipated from the impure altruists as their very act of generosity already brings them warm -glow (Andreoni, 1990; Ferguson & Flynn, 2016). Thus, impure altruists may not be that concerned about the efficacy of their donations unlike the pure altruists Findings from both lab and field experiments (e.g. Khanna, Posnett, & Sandler, 1995; Weisbrod, 2000) overall favoured the IA, which constitutes an integrated perspective of egoism and altruism , in explaining charitable givin g. In fact, the notion of 'Warm -Glow' giving has gathered extensive support from various economic experiments (e.g. Carpenter, Connolly, & Myers, 2008; Palfrey & Prisbrey, 1997), particularly the Charity Dictator Game in which a dictator was deprived of an y altruistic motivation to make any donations (See Crumpler & Grossman, 2008). All in all, the EAH, NSRM and the IA models had acknowledged the role of positive (i.e. empathy for EAH; 'warm -glow' for IA) and negative emotions (i.e. negative state relief i n NSRM) in cultivating prosociality, despite the fact that each model had theorise d a unique mechanism through which a Chapter 1 14 specific emotion will foster prosociality. However, as mentioned previously all these models had adopted a helper -centred perspective in examining prosociality (Fisher, 1983). As a result, little attention was placed on 1) how a recipient may react emotionally to that help, for instance, a wounded self - esteem (Nadler, Peri, & Chemerinski, 1985; Nadler us & Lazarus, 1996; McCullough et al., 2001); and 2) how such a reaction (e.g. to demonise the helper (Hatfield & Sprecher, 1983) or to gratefully reciprocate (Ma, Tunney, & Ferguson, 2014)) will contribute to any future, ongoing helper -recipient interacti ons (Fisher, 1983; Fisher et al., 1983). Therefore, one principal objective of the current thesis is to examine the effect of recipients' positive and negative emotions on their cooperative or sanctioning behaviours. Particularly, present thesis primarily focuses on how gratitude , i.e. a typical positive benefit -triggered affect (Lambert, Graham, & Fincham, 2009; Lambert & Fincham, 2011), would facilitate the recipient's reciprocal or sanctioning decision in a behavioural economics context. Meanwhile, the thesis also sheds light on how indebtedness , a negatively - valenced affective state triggered via a favour acceptance (Goei & Boster, 2005; Peebles, 2010), contributes to people's economic decisions. The current thesis entails also the scrutiny over how dispositional gratitude (Adler & Fagley, 2005; McCullough, Emmons, & Tsang, 2002; Watkins, Woodward, Stone, & Kolts, 2003) and indebtedness (Mathews & Shook, 2013; Solom, Watkins, McCurrach, & Scheibe, 2016; Watkins, 2014) might shape people's prosociality or sanctioning. Below (i.e. Section 1.3) I review the evidence on the associations of gratitude and indebtedness to prosociality or sanctioning. 1.3. Gratitude, Indebtedness and Prosociality Chapter 1 15 1.3.1. What Gratitude Constitutes? Roman philosopher Marcus Cice ro (106 BC - 43 BC) once proclaimed that 'Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others.' Clearly, gratitude has always been held in high regard (Fitzgerald, 1998) whereby the expression of such, when it is due, draws appr oval whereas a failure to acknowledge (or appreciate) others' benevolence is egregious (Amato, 1982; Emmons & Shelton, 2002; McCullough et al., 2001). In addition to an emotional acknowledg ement of someone else's generosity, gratitude is also conceptualis ed as a trait that encapsulates a 'life orientation toward noticing and appreciating the positives in life (pp.891)' (Wood, Froh, & Geraghty, 2010). McCullough et al. (2002) contended that such a worldview is what motivates a grateful person to not take an y positives for granted and therefore recogni ses other people's contribution to his/her well - being. Consequently, these people are more capable of reaping the benefits, e.g. subjective happiness, from their positive life encounters (Weiner, 1985). This resonates with the notion whereby gratitude constit utes an essential part to a quality life (Peterson & Seligman, 2004; Watkins et al., 2003; Watkins, 2007). 1.3.2. Emotional Gratitude and Prosociality In addition to the betterment of one's emotional well -being, McCullough and colleagues (McCullough et al. , 2001; McCullough, Kimeldorf, & Cohen, 2008) argued that gratitude as an emotion is integral to one's social functioning. They theori sed that gratitude , thanks to its three inbuilt moral functions, promotes and perpetuates prosocial interactions between a giver and a recipient (Watkins, 2007). The below delves into these three functions and how each of them relates to the facilitation and maintenance of prosociality. Chapter 1 16 1.3.2.1. Gratitude the Moral Barometer First, the Moral Barometer hypothesis argues that g ratitude would function as a benefit detector (McCullough et al., 2001; McCullough et al., 2008) as it informs a recipient if someone had benefited him/her, and crucially, whether that benefit was worth feeling gratitude for. People only experience gratitu de when they sense that someone was being benevolent to them and that generosity should, in no circumstances, originate from any selfish or deceitful intent on behalf of the benefactors (Heider, 1958; Simmons, 1979). As such, the experience of gratitude entails social cognition (See Steindl -Rast, 2004; Wood, Maltby, Stewart, Linley, & Joseph, 2008). In particular, McCullough et al. (2001) outlined four social -cognitive factors recipients typically attend to when evalua ting whether a benefit is worthy of their gratitude. They included, 1) whether that benefit was valuable ; 2) whether the givers incurred a material cost amid the conferment of that benefit; 3) whether that benefit was delivered intentionally (or by chance ); and 4) whether that benefit was rendered because of the benefactor's role-based obligations. 1.3.2.2. Gratitude as a Moral Motive Meanwhile, the moral motive hypothesis stipulates that gratitude also serves to motivate recipients to repay their benefac tors via ' contributing to their welfare in the future (pp.252)' and to also refrain from acting ' destructively toward the benefactor (pp.252)' (McCullough et al., 2001). That is, in addition to celebrating an undeserved although welcomed kindness (Steindl -Rast, 2004), gratitude also prompts a beneficiary to return this kindness (Komter, 2004). Nonetheless, such a return of generosity should by not be likened to as an act of debt settlement. Gratitude is characterised by (or at least close ly linked Chapter 1 17 to) a feeling of warmth (Wood, Joseph, & Maltby, 2008), compassion (Horberg, Oveis, & Keltner, 2011), and key among those, a desire for social proximity to one's benefactor (Mayer, Salovey, Gomberg -Kaufman, & Blainey, 1991). Thus, a grateful reci pient's endeavour to reciprocate should be deemed more of a stepping stone to establishing social closeness with the helper (Fitzgerald, 1998). This gratitude -driven reciprocity perspective resonates with the Impure Altruism model (See Andreoni, 1989, 1990 ) in that a prosocial gesture (i.e. reciprocation) is driven by both altruistic (i.e. to contribute to benefactor's welfare) and egoistic (i.e. to acquire social proximity to helper) motives. 1.3.2.3. Gratitude as a Moral Reinforcer McCullough et al. (200 1) stated that gratitude functions also as a moral reinforcer as its expression symboli ses recognition for the helpers' initial kindness. Such a recognition will encourage the same helper to continue to be generous in the future (Grant & Gino, 2010) and he nce strengthens the existing helper -recipient rapport (Fitzgerald, 1998). Indeed, the robust association between the frequency of expressing gratitude and the relationship quality in intimate relationships, which is well -documented in the literature (e.g. Algoe, Gable, & Maisel, 2010; 2011), best attests to the hypothesis of gratitude as a moral reinforcer. To conclude, the above th ree moral functions of gratitude outlined the mechanism through which a recipient develops an urge to reciprocate rather than to 'bite the hand that feeds'. The above hypotheses also underlined the conceptual discrepancy between the gratitude -motivated reciprocity with the act of debt settlement from a rapport -building perspective. In other words, Chapter 1 18 gratitude inspires a 'want to (pp. 111)' form of reciprocity (Schaumberg & Flynn, 2009) and in so doing prompts a recipient to establish a social affiliation with the benefactor (Bartlett, Condon, Cruz, Baumann & Desteno, 2012). 1.3.3. Dispositional Gratitude and its Indirect Link to Prosociality While the above underscored how gratitude as a transitory state could motivate and sustain prosociality, the Socia l-Cognitive Model of Gratitude (i.e. SCMG hereafter; Wood et al., 2008) outlined how gratitude as a trait may indirectly prompt prosociality via a particular chain of attributional and emotional processing. In particular, the SCMG argued that what makes a dispositionally grateful recipient more capable of experiencing gratitude \u2014 following a benefit receipt \u2014is the manner he/she appraises the benefit. Wood et al. (2008) theori sed that a grateful recipient is more likely to interpret the benefit he/she receive d as i) propelled by the giver's benevolence ; ii) costly to the giver; and ii) valuable to oneself. Such an overall favourable appraisal thus elicits more intense experience of gratitude (Wood et al., 2008), with this heightened feeling of gratitude being well -documented to predict reciprocity or prosociality from the recipient (Tsang, 2007, Tsang et al., 2012). Overall, the SCMG hinted a possible indirect role of dispositional gratitude in fostering positive reciprocity by somewhat 'distorting' the perception of the benefice and the ensuing feeling of gratefulness toward one's benefactor. 1.3.4. Gratitude and Prosociality in the Behavioural Economics Literature Interestingly, despite the strong theoretical link between gratitude and cooperation (or sanctioning) gratitude still remains an under -researched domain in the experimental economics literature (Leung, 2011). Nonetheless, there is no shortage of evidence in the BE literature for the link between perceived Chapter 1 19 kindness (and fairness) and decisions to sanction (or reciprocate ) (e.g. Camerer, 2003; Charness & Rabin, 2002; G\u00fcney & Newell, 2013). Indeed, the link between intent attribution (i.e. kindness and fairness) and gratitude is also well documented in the Social Psychology literature (Emmons, 200 4; Pruyser, 1976). Taken together, it is conceivable that the kindness -driven reciprocity may be attributable to gratitude. However, to date there is only one published article which examined how the direct manipulation of state gratitude will contribute t o cooperative economic decision -making (i.e. Desteno et al., 2010). As such, one primary contribution of the present thesis entails the combination of Experimental Economics and Psychometrics in the analyses of the role of gratitude in nurturing prosociali ty. The below two sub -sections (i.e. Sub - sections 1.3.4.1 and 1.3.4.2.) entail a brief review of Desteno et al's (2010) work and a discussion of how that paper relates to the current investigation. 1.3.4.1. Brief Review of Desteno et al.'s (2010) Paper Desteno et al. (2010) employed the 'Give -Some Dilemma Game (i.e. GSDG hereafter)' in which a player decides whether to be selfish (i.e. to retain all the endowment) or trustful (i.e. to entrust their endowment to a co -player and runs the risk of being take n advantage of) (Nelissen, Dijker, & deVries, 2007; Parise, Prior to the GSDG , a portion of participants (i.e. the ' Gratitude condition') were induced to feel gratitude toward the confederates following a benefit receipt (See Bartlett & Desteno, 2006). Desteno et al. (2010) also manipulated the partner identities in the GSDG: some participants were partnered with strangers (i.e. ' Stranger ' condition) while others played alongside the confederates who helped them during the gratitude induction phase (i.e. ' Benefactor ' condition). Chapter 1 20 Gratitude was overall demonstrated to predict trustfulness in the GSDG. Interestingly, Desteno et al. (2010) showed no evidence that whether a participant played with his/her benefactor or a strang er had tampered with their prosociality (or lack thereof) in the GSDG. In other words, gratitude -inspired reciprocities are not confined to direct reciprocation (Nowak & Roch, 2007; Nowak & Sigmund, 2005), as it also entails a 'pay -it-forward' variant via which a recipient passes on the benevolence of the helper to a third party (Chang, Lin, & Chen, 2012; Gray , Ward, & Norton, 2014; Schaumberg & Flynn, 2009). Desteno et al's (2010) findings resonated with Nowak and Roch's (2007) argument in relation to the critical role of gratitude in inciting (and also perpetuating) both direct and indirect reciprocations. The data also gave credence to Fredrickson's (2004a) Broaden -and-Build perspective on how gratitude nurtures indirect and direct reciprocities. In particular, Fredrickson (2004b) theori sed that gratitude could add to the creativity of a recipient thanks to its 'perspective -broadening' property as a typical positive affect . This increased creativity thus enables that recipient to not religiously stick with the traditional 'tit -for-tat' restitution of the helpers' kindness, but to adopt an alternative approach such as directing such a generosity to an 'innocent ' other. 1.3.4.2. What was lacking in Desteno et al. (2010)? While Desteno et al. (2010) had pioneered the scrutiny of gratitude in the realm of economic exchanges; there are certain glaring methodological issues which may have undermined the validity i n their analyses. Examining the method through which Desteno et al. (2010) induced gratitude, that is, to subject the participants to a bogus computer failure and then the confederates came to their 'rescue', it is conceivable that these 'victims' may feel indebted Chapter 1 21 apart from grateful toward their 'saviours'. Given the supposedly 'breakdown' took place when the participants were working on their cover task, the participants may have held themselves responsible for that mishap and therefore felt guilty for h aving bothered their helpers for starters (Naito & Sakata, 2010). Indeed, Greenberg and Shapiro (1971) argued that indebtedness is characterised by a sentiment of guilt which originates the receipt of an undeserved kindness. Therefore, as highlighted in th e Negative -State Relief Model (Cialdini et al., 1973; Cialdini et al., 1987) these indebted participants (in Desteno et al (2010)) may behave prosocially later on with the aim to salvage their moods. However, neither had Desteno et al. (2010) even explicit ly mentioned nor implied, let alone addressed this alternative explanation throughout their paper. As a result, I believe this should leave the door open for the present thesis to a) explore how indebtedness could affect people's cooperation or sanctioning in an economic game; and to b) discern the mechanisms through which indebtedness and gratitude prompt sanctioning or reciprocities. Below (i.e. Sub -sections 1.3.5 to 1.3.7) I review indebtedness as a psychological concept and how it relates to the scope o f the current thesis. 1.3.5. What Indebtedness Constitutes? German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche once described that 'Great indebtedness does not make men grateful, but vengeful; and if a little charity is not forgotten, it turns into a gnawing worm'. I ndeed, indebtedness represents an unpleasant mental and physiological state as triggered by an urge to repay a benefactor (Greenberg, 1980; Greenberg & Frisch, 1972). Unlike gratitude, state indebtedness is often accompanied by negative feelings such as pe rceived inferiority to the helper (Homans, 1961) and inequity (Adams, 1963, 1965). Chapter 1 22 Meanwhile, indebtedness as a disposition , that is, the 'creditor personality' (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983), is characterised by, a) a religious adherence to the reciprocity principles (Gouldner, 1960); b) intense discomfort being a receiver in an exchange; c) an urge to immediately settle any outstanding debts; and interestingly, d) a tendency to keep his/her beneficiaries indebted via shunning their endeavours to repay (Gre enberg & Westcott, 1983). 1.3.6. Indebtedness, Reciprocity and Sanctioning 1.3.6.1. State Indebtedness, Reciprocity and Sanctioning Schaumberg and Flynn (2009) noted that despite the differences in motivation, indebtedness , just like gratitude , also prompts a return of benefactor's kindness. However, this motivation to make restitutions stems from the urge to escape from the unpleasant feeling of owing (Gergen, Ellsworth, Maslach, & Seipel, 1975) or to eradicate the perceived inequity (i.e. being 'over -benefited', See Hatfield & Sprecher, 1983). Greenberg, Block and Silverman (1971) even added that an indebted person would normally feel apprehension at the prospects of a lack of avenue to make restitutions. Therefore, contrary to what Empathy -Altruism Hypothesis (Batson et al., 1981) and the Impure Altruism model (Andreoni, 1989, 1990) suggest, indebtedness -inspired reciprocity may not stem from any altruistic motives. In fact, such a viewpoint has been recapitulated by Greenberg and Westcott (1 983) who argued that to assure the window of reciprocation is open an indebted person may go as far to sabotage a third party's efforts to help the initial helper. Thus, unlike gratitude -inspired reciprocity, indebtedness -inspired reciprocity leans more to wards the Negative State Relief Model (Cialdini et al., 1987) whereby a person engages in prosociality for the sole purpose of mood Chapter 1 23 management (i.e. to escape from the psychological shackle of being in debt). All in all, indebtedness as an emotion should, resembling gratitude, also possess a capacity to incite reciprocity in an economic exchange, although it is well documented that the two constructs will operate on two distinct mechanisms in necessitating reciprocity (Schaumberg & Flynn, 2009; Watkins et a l., 2006). Nevertheless, Greenberg (1980) argued that other than reciprocation Cognitive Restructuring also constitutes a 'major mode of indebtedness reduction (pp.95)'. Cognitive Restructuring (i.e. CR) entails a re -assessment and hence a restructuring o f the cognition that dictates the initial experience of indebtedness (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983). Specifically, a recipient would re - consider factors such as 1) whether the helper was that benevolent as originally interpreted, or 2) whether the benefit wa s intentional or just a fluke. These restructuring efforts will downplay a recipient's feeling of obligation and more importantly, his/her perceived necessity to reciprocate (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983). Nonetheless, when applying CR the recipient also run s the risk of distorting the reality (Folkman & Lazarus, 1991), and thereby earns disapproval from others. This is especially the case when there are witnesses, particularly the benefactor, to the exchange episode (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983). As such, a recipient would only prefer Cognitive Restructuring when certain parameters are met (Greenberg, 1980). They include, first, the lack of witnesses to the initial helping episode(s), second, a perceived lack of opportunity to reciprocate; and fina lly, recipients expecting minimal future exchanges with the benefactors (or the witnesses). Indeed, all these parameters constitute a typical economic game context. That is, a one-shot, double -blind game which disincentivises reputation building (G\u00fcney & N ewell, 2013) while Chapter 1 24 preserves players' anonymity (e.g. Eckel & Grossman, 1996a). Building upon this logic, it should be no surprise that players in such economic games may resort to Cognitive Restructuring to mitigate their experienced indebtedness. 1.3.6. 2. Dispositional Indebtedness and Economic Decision -making Indebtedness as a disposition could also influence people's sanctioning or reciprocal decisions in an economic exchange. As discussed above, a dispositionally indebted individual has 'low threshol d' toward the concepts of owing and being owed, coupled with a distaste to be on the recipient side of an exchange (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983). These attributes should account for a 'trait creditor's' reluctance to accept favours, and their urge to ately reciprocate following their futile endeavours to 'say no' to the favours. Meanwhile, another hallmark of a trait creditor entails the preference to be under -benefited in an interaction (Hatfield & Sprecher, 1983). Dispositionally indebted individuals fancy putting others in their debt and would even strive to sabotage their debtors' efforts to repay (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983). Taken together, one should expect the following observations from a dispositionally indebted participant in an economic gam e. They include, a) benefit rejections, b) reciprocity (or a lack of defaulting), and c) generous giving (should the participant assumes the role of a prospective helper). 1.3.7. Indebtedness in the Behavioural Economics Literature Despite the above inferences and theoretical evidence pertaining to the link between indebtedness and reciprocity , indebtedness is still an unexplored domain in the behavioural economics literature. To date, I am yet to locate any published, empirical study on how indebtedn ess contributes to people's sanctioning or reciprocal decisions in the realm of economic exchanges. Chapter 1 25 Meanwhile, there is a strong evidence base for the role of negative emotion in inciting retaliations in economic games. For instance, Xiao and Houser (2005 ) revealed, via the ultimatum game (i.e. UGs hereafter), how recipients may exercise costly retaliation to vent out their fury sparked by their unfair treatment. Yamagishi et al. (2009) further theori sed that the refusal to cooperate, after being subjected to an unfair treatment in the UGs (i.e. unequal split in endowment), symbolises an emotional reaction to other's exploitations. As discussed in Section 1.3.6.1, an indebted recipient may resort to Cognitive Restructuring to get over their feeling of indeb tedness (Greenberg, 1980). It is, therefore, theoretically intriguing to examine whether these restructuring efforts would not only downplay a recipient's desire to reciprocate, but to also lead to sanctioning when opportunity beckons. For instance, an indebted recipient, following a secondary assessment of the whole episode of benefit conferment, may infer more cynicism and ill intent from the helper's initial ingratiating gesture (e.g. 'He/she is helping me because he/she has a 'benevolent' image to maint ain. God knows what he/she would have done otherwise had there been no one else watching!'). This perceived cynical intent may well induce sanctions or retaliations (Falk & Fischbacher, 2006). Taken together, via the current thesis I intend to also examine whether this Cognitive Restructuring (Greenberg, 1980; Greenberg & Westcott, 1983) route does encapsulate how the construct indebtedness will relate to reciprocity or sanctioning in economic exchanges \u2014which remains a gap in the literature. 1.4. Basic Predictions or Hypotheses First, I hypothesi sed that gratitude should predict more cooperation (in the form of positive reciprocity ) and less sanctioning in the series of economic Chapter 1 26 games. This prediction indeed echoes the Moral Motive functional hypothesis of gratitude (McCullough et al, 2001) as discussed above (i.e. Section 1.3.2.2). Second, with reference to the Social Cognitive Model of Gratitude (Wood et al., 2008) I hypothesi se an indirect effect of dispositional gratitude on one's sanctioning or reciproc al decisions. Specifically, I predict the path between trait gratitude and reciprocation to be serially mediated by 1) benefit appraisal (e.g. perceived value in the benefit and helpers' intent etc.) and 2) state gratitude. While indebtedness could invoke reciprocation out of a drive -reduction motive (Greenberg & Shapiro, 1971), it may also prompt a recipient to re -assess the whole episode of benefit receipt (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983). Greenberg (1980) argued that such a re -assessment may result in denig ration of the benefactors which ultimately prompts sanctioning. Since the three economic games (details to be discussed in Chapters 3 to 5) at present all entail the 'ingredients' for Cognitive Restructuring (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983), namely, a) a doubl e-blind design, b) a lack of repeated interactions; and c) the lack of witnesses to the whole sequence of benefit exchanges, there is no reason to not expect individuals to favour re -construing their entire episode of being benefited over reciprocation as to get over their emotional indebtedness. Additionally, I predicted dispositional indebtedness to prompt benefit rejections (if possible), as dispositionally indebted people typically loathe being in a position to receive (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983). I a nticipate dispositional indebtedness to also prompt benevolent or even 'over -generous' economic decisions, such as surrendering resources unconditionally to an unacquainted co-player (Gergen et al., 1975), since a 'trait creditor' will relish the feeling o f someone in their debt (Mathews & Green, 2010; Mathews & Shook, 2013). Chapter 1 27 1.5. An Overview of the Empirical Chapters (i.e. Chapters 2 to 5) In this thesis an aggregate of three economic games, which involved 390 participants, were conducted to primarily exa mine how gratitude relate to cooperation or sanctioning in an economic exchange context. Various sets of parameters (e.g. cost of helping, repeated or iterated design etc.) were manipulated throughout the three experiments. Additionally, a meta -analysis was conducted to examine the overall strength of the gratitude -prosociality link. The meta -analysis and the three experimental studies are presented in four separate but related empirical chapters (i.e. Chapters 2 to 5). The following sub - sections (i.e. 1.5. 1 to 1.5.4) present an overview of each empirical chapter. 1.5.1. Chapter 2: The Meta -analysis on Gratitude and Prosociality Chapter 2 presents the findings of the meta -analytic review. Via meta - analysing over a hundred studies \u2014conducted in the past three decades \u2014I intended to achieve two objectives. First, I aimed to provide an estimate on how strong the gratitude -prosociality association is based on the existing empirical studies. Since the overarching aim of the current thesis concerns the analysis over how gratitude relates to prosociality in a specific context, it is, therefore, crucial to ascertain that there is at least a reliable association the two constructs. Second, I scrutini sed what methodological and/or theoretical moderators may have moderated the overall effect estimates. This moderator analysis would examine study features such as the type of prosociality under scrutiny (e.g. reciprocal or non-reciprocal measures, actual behaviours or intentions etc.), the method via which gratitude was induced. This moderator analysis should have both theoretical (e.g. how the gratitude is different from other positive affect s in its link with prosociality) and practical implications Chapter 1 28 (e.g. what aspects of the current gratitude in tervention regime (See Wood et al. (2010) for a review) the practitioners to modify as to boost its much doubted efficacy in enhancing well -being (Davis et al., 2016; Wood et al., 2010). 1.5.2. Chapter 3: Experiment 1 The meta -analysis revealed that gratitude is more strongly linked to prosociality among studies which measured i) direct reciprocal outcomes and ii) gratitude as a state . Hence, via Experiment 1 (which is presented in Chapter 3) I examined the state gratitude - direct reciprocity in a one -off economic context. In so doing I conducted a one -shot, variant of trust game played by 61 dyads. Experiment 1 entails as well the scrutiny of how the injunctive norm will contribute to the gratitude -reciprocity link. Speci fically, I examined how normati ve fairness (Elster, 2006), which is well -documented to affect intent attribution (See Bicchieri, 2006), would ultimately contribute to a recipient's experience of gratitude and his/her desire (and actual decisions) to reciprocate. An injunctive fairness norm delineates what an average fair person ought to behave in a given context (Kazemi et al., 2016; Paddock, 2005). The injunctive norm under scrutiny in Experiment 1 was \u2014'people should help for free when that help is easy to implement, and when the helpe rs' potency as a prospective helper was assigned but not earned (See Frey & Bohnet, 1995).' Participants were subjected to a dyadic game in which all of them had to roll a die should they intended to win additional money. Each dyad would comprise a loser and a winner. The losers (N=61) \u2014who were later on the prospective recipients , were led to be lieve that the winners \u2014who were later on the potential helpers , had won the game by better fortune. On the other hand, Chapter 1 29 the 'winners' (N= 61) also knew their partners were losing \u2014and therefore missed out the bonus money \u2014thanks to poor fortune. The 'losers' thus all warranted a 'donation' (i.e. a transfer of money -equivalent 'bonus points') from their victorious partners to be eligible to earn the bonus money. Since the winners here were practically 'assigned' (via chances) to a victorious position instead of having earned that (Frey & Bohnet, 1995; Hoffman & Spitzer, 1985; Hoffman et al., 1994), the injunctive norm would demand an average fair winner (i.e. P1s hereafter) to help a struggling partner (i.e. P2s hereafter) by making a 'free' donation (i.e. to share the proceeds with the latter equally, See Elster, 2006). All P1s first decided whether to help, and should they did they were then inquired whether they would demand some repayment. Thus, P1s decided whether to help fairly (i.e. no repayment needed) or unfairly (i.e. repayment -bound offers) from a normative standpoint. Meanwhile, P2s reserved the rights to accept or decline their offers. Crucially, P2s were kept unaware of the list of 'helping options' available the P1s. That is, P2s had no idea th eir P1 partners could decide whether to help with or without the imposition of a repayment clause. As such, P2s here were put in a position where they could only infer the fairness of their help (if they were given any) by whether that help was conditional or unconditional . I examined whether an injunctively unfair offer (i.e. the conditional offers) would lead to a less desirable giver intent attribution, thus lead to reduced gratitude (and greater indebtedness ) and ultimately a lower desire to reciproca te. Additionally, these recipients were given an avenue to sanction their helpers by under -repaying. P2s who accepted their conditional offers, after being reminded of their obligated repayment, were inquired how much they Chapter 1 30 would repay (i.e. to repay fully, nothing , or partially ). Only P2s who accepted the conditional offers were aware of this 'defaulting option'. This set -up should enable the author to use this de facto 'voluntary' repayment as a behavioural indicator of how the acceptors a) valued their un fair offers and accordingly, b) responded to their partners' belittlement with normative fairness. In summary, in Experiment 1 I created a context in which people were bound to rely on the injunctive norm to judge whether they had been fairly treated. In so doing I examined how this evaluation would foster a favourable (negative) interpretation of the donor's intent, and consequently contributed to an elevated gratitude (indebtedness ) by the recipient. I also explored whether this chain of attributions wou ld constitute a similar effect on a recipient's state indebtedness , and subsequently tampered with ones' reciprocal or sanctioning decisions. Importantly, Experiment 1 permits the analyses of whether people would resort to normative fairness to guide their economic decisions; and if yes, how such a fairness inference will affect the gratitude -prosociality link. 1.5.3. Chapter 4: Experiment 2 Chapter 4 presents the second laboratory study which was a one -shot game via which I attempted to address an interesting phenomenon \u2014i.e. Cheap - riding . Cheap -riding is conceptualised in the wider literature as a member's attempts to piggyback on the high co ntribution of his/her groupmates by giving as little as possible (Asch, Gigliotti, & Polito, 1993; Thompson, 1987). Analysing the repayment data from Experiment 1, nearly 40% (i.e.38%; N=8) of recipients (of conditional offers) had taken advantage of th eir defaulting options by either under -repaying fully or partially . Interestingly, scrutiny of these defaulters' responses only revealed one instance of zero back -Chapter 1 31 transfer (i.e. free -riding), while the rest of the defectors (N=7) overall still repaid 58% o f their expected repayment. I interpret such a partial repayment as cheap -riding as it evidently involves the exploitation of others' giving amidst own non -zero contributions (Bchir & Willinger, 2013; Cornes & Sandler, 1984). Despite the existing covera ge in the wider literature (e.g. Krishnamurthy, 2000; Olson & Perl, 2005; Scherer, 1993) it remains unexamined in regards the psychological correlates of cheap -riding . Specifically, to date there is still an absence of empirical assessment of the role of emotions in inciting (and potentially sustaining) or restraining cheap -riding. While speculations had been made \u2014e.g., giving 'just & Thielmann, 2006) \u2014in Chapter 3 in relation to the possible psychologica l correlates on why people may cheap -ride, none were empirically examined in Experiment 1. Thus to date there is still a gap in the literature on the role of emotion in cheap -riding. As a result, in order to fill this gap Experiment 2 was set out to explo re the psychological (e.g. state gratitude, indebtedness, just deserts, or even Experienced Warm -glow (Ferguson & Flynn, 2016)) and situational (e.g. the conditionality of offers) correlates of cheap -riding . Furthermore, small proportion of recipients i) being 'eligible' to (i.e. 21/ 61= 34%; N = 21), and ii) subsequently deciding to (i.e. 8/61= 13.1%; N = 8), under -repay (cheap - or free -ride) their conditional offers in Experiment 1 would no doubt warrant a relatively less under -sampled (N= 135) and more focused follow -up investigation in Experiment 2. Hence, via a slightly modified game I aimed to examine i) the 'baseline' response (i.e. to fully repay Chapter 1 32 ('cooperate'), utterly not repay ('free -ride'), or just partially repay ('cheap - ride') to a 'non -free' conditional offer (Ma et al., 2014), ii) whether the offer - triggered emotions such as gratitude or indebtedness would be predictive of cheap -riding , and finally, iii) the motives (e.g. warm -glow , just deserts) behind recipients' repayment \u2014which should all ow the disambiguation between the psychological profiles of the cheap -riders , free-riders and that of cooperators . In Experiment 2 each participant played in pairs with an anonymous, in reality fictitious , 'partner'. Unlike Experiment 1, all participants (N =135) were pre-programmed to 'lose out' on the dice -rolling and were accordingly entitled to zero bonus. Participants then received an offer from their 'fortunate', victorious partners. All these offers were conditional, as recipients learned that upon acceptance they all undertook an obligation to repay. Participants, depending on their assigned conditions, would be due to receive a) an 'Interest - free' ( N = 32), or b) a '12.5% -Interest' ( N = 33), or c) '25% 34)', or d) a '50% -Interest (N= 36)' offer. Via this manipulation of the interest charges I subjected participants to varying extent of normative unfairness. Similar to Experiment 1, the 'winners' should have no moral legitimacy to expect any repayment from their unlucky partners (Elst er, 2006), as the former had not earned the property right to that victory (Fahr & Irlenbusch, 2000; Frey & Bohnet, 1995). Thus the very fact that the offer was rendered conditional (repayment -bound) should already represent normative unfairness (Ma et al. , 2014). Participants were again blind to the range of offers they could have received. Acceptors ( N = 87) were then allowed to decide whether to a) repay in full (i.e. 'cooperating', N = 59), b) to 'cheap -ride' via just giving back partially (N = 17); or c) to entirely not repay (i.e. 'free -riding', N = 11). Chapter 1 33 Experiment 2 was concluded by participants filling out surveys that examined their motives to repay (See Chapter 4 for the items in use) and dispositional gratitude (i.e. Gratitude -Questionnaire VI, M cCullough et al., 2002). 1.5.4. Chapter 5: Experiment 3 Chapter 5 presents the third experimental study which was an iterated game. The key objective of Experiment 3 is to resolve a few unaddressed issues in Experiments 1 and 2, and in so doing I endeavou red to complement the robustness of the present investigation of gratitude -induced prosociality. Particularly, in Experiment 3 a few new design features \u2014which are summari sed below \u2014 were incorporated to help tackle certain unaddressed issues in Experiments 1 and 2 (which would be expanded upon in Chapter 5). First, as opposed to Experiments 1 and 2, recipients in Experiment 3 were no longer na\u00efve to the fact that they could have been treated more generously or harshly by their helpers. This was achieved b y having the 133 participants played both roles as a prospective helper and recipient in the current game. Specifically, participants played as a potential helper in the first and the tenth trial, and the eight trials in between during which participants played as a recipient (i.e. the 'Recipient Trials') were sandwiched by these two 'Helper Trials'. Thus, the opening trial should notify the players of the choice sets of a helper prior to them playing as a recipient (i.e. Trials 2 to 9). Such a transparency of helpers' options should accordingly allow recipients to appraise their offer receipts not only based on what they actually received, but also on what they could have been given instead (Charness & Levine, 2007). Another crucial revised feature of Exper iment 3 entails recipients' awareness of the 'options' to under -repay prior to their acceptance (or rejection) Chapter 1 34 decisions. This new feature was brought in to tackle a possible flaw in Experiments 1 and 2 that might have arguably contributed to the surprisin gly high rate of offer rejections (i.e. 36%) in Experiment 2. As previewed above (i.e. Sections 1.5.2 and 1.5.3), recipients in Experiments 1 and 2 only came to realise the feasibility of them under -repaying after they accepted their conditional offers. Th erefore, it is not illogical to argue that acceptors in either Experiments 1 or 2 may have assumed and possibly agreed to the binding nature of the repayment contract upon indicating acceptances. The corollary of this argument is that those who disapproved of the arrangement (i.e. being treated unfairly normatively speaking) may have jumped on the very first chance to quit the arrangement. Indeed, evidence in the Impunity Game (IG) literature had w ell evidenced the feasibility of people 'irrationally' rejecting a financially advantageous arrangement out of perceived infringement of social fairness (See Horita & Yamagishi, 2007; Ma et al., 2012; Yamagishi et al., 2012). As such, it might be problemat ic to refer to the repayment (or the lack thereof) in Experiment 2 as the behavioural index of how people 'valued' being unfairly treated, considering that those who were disgusted by the offer would have been filtered before even being 'eligible' to showc ase their discontent. Therefore, via this modified feature I intended to rectify this potential methodological loophole, and in so doing added to the validity of the repayment metrics as the behavioural (alongside the existing emotional ) index of reciproca l or sanctioning decisions in Experiment 3. Meanwhile, the third key modification enables Experiment 3 to examine an interesting question: does the experience of being 'cheap -rode' prompt more fair plays from the victims? Throughout the present thesis I have drawn Chapter 1 35 parallels between the mechanisms of cheap -riding and that of altruistic punishment (Egas & Riedl, 2008; Nelissen & Zeelenberg, 2009). That is, by incurring a cost (despite not having to) a cheap -rider endeavours to warn his/her victim again st treating others ungenerously in the future. Nonetheless, it remains to be seen whether cheap -riding does serve that function, and even if so, how well it 'emulates' altruistic punishment in preserving cooperation in the long-run (Barclay, 2006; Fowler, 2005; Jordan, McAuliffe, & Rand, 2015) Therefore, in Experiment 3 I manipulated partners' repayment among players who gave conditional offers in Trial 1(i.e. the initial 'Helper Trial'). Participants were randomly assigned to one out of three conditions in which their conditional offers yielded different repayment. These conditions included, first, a 'Fairness' condition ( N = 44) in which the 'partners' repaid fully; second, a 'Cheap -riding' condition ( N = 44) in which they received part of their obligat ed repayment. Alternatively, a participant could end up in the 'Free - riding' condition ( N = 45) in which he/she was subjected to a full -blown free - riding (i.e. no repayment at all) at the hands of his/her 'partner'. All in all, via this new feature I inten ded to assess the efficacy of cheap -riding in fostering future cooperative decisions in the later phase of the game (i.e. Trials 2 to 10). Chapter 2 36 Chapter 2 Does Gratitude Enhance Prosociality: A Meta -Analytic Review A version of Chapter 2 has been re -submitted to the Psychological Bulletin for publication (manuscript number: BUL -2016 -0614R, currently under review ): Ma, L.K., Tunney, R.J., & Ferguson, E. (2016). Does Gratitude Enhance Prosociality: A Meta -Analytic Review . Unpublished manuscript, School of Psychology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, The United Kingdom. Chapter 2 37 2.0. Overview of Chapter 2 As previewed in Chapter 1, this chapter presents a meta -analysis on how gratitude relates to prosociality . Theoretical models (e.g. the Moral Functional Hypotheses of Gratitude (McCullough et al., 2001; McCullough et al., 2008); Social -Cognitive Model of Gratitude (Wood et al., 2008)) suggest that gratitude is linked to increased prosociality . To date, however, there is a lack o f a comprehensive quantitative synthesis of results to support this claim , in spite of a host of empirical (e.g. Bartlett et al., 2012; Goei, Roberto, Meyer, & Carlyle, 2007; Halali et al., 2016) and theoretical evidence (e.g. Emmons, 2004; Frederickson, 2 004a; McCullough & Tsang, 2004) pointing to this link. Given the recurring theme of this thesis pertains to how gratitude nurtures prosociality (or cooperativeness) in the realm of economic exchanges; it is of paramount importance that I ensure these two constructs are reliably associated in the wider literature. From a theoretical standpoint, it is also crucial to examine whether the gratitude -prosociality link is moderated by whether the type of interaction concerned involves reciprocity . And if so, is gratitude more conducive to the direct 'tit-for-tat' (Boyd & Richerson, 1989; Brown, 1996; Milinski, 1987) or the indirect 'pay-it-forward' (Chang et al., 2012; Gray et al., 2014; Schaumberg & Flynn, 2009) kind of reciprocity? Hence, via this meta -analysi s I endeavoured to 1) examine the overall strength of the association between gratitude and prosociality , and to 2) identify the theoretical and methodological variables that moderate this link. Two- hundred and fifty -two effect sizes from 91 studies across 65 papers \u2014(Total N = 18,342 participants) \u2014were identified and included in the present review. Chapter 2 38 The findings revealed a statistically significant, and moderate positive correlation between gratitude and prosociality ( r = 0.37 4). This association was significantly larger among studies that assessed reciprocal outcomes relative to non-reciprocal outcomes, and in particular among studies examining direct \u2014 compared to indirect \u2014reciprocity. Studie s that examined gratitude as an affective state reported significantly larger effect size studies assessing gratitude as a disposition . Further the results revealed that studies that examined benefit - triggered gratitude (in response to other's kindness ) had a stro nger effect that generalized gratitude that focuses on the appreciation of what is valued and cherished in life (See Lambert et al., 2009; Lambert & Fincham, 2011) . Overall, apart from the main effect estimates which practically confirms the exi stence of a reliable relationship between gratitude and prosociality, the present chapter also shed light upon a few methodological and theoretical attributes that could account for the inconsistencies in the effect sizes as reported from the range of samp led studies . Both theoretical and practical significance of the present findings will be described and discussed in detail. 2.1. Introduction 2.1.1. Gratitude Revisited The Latin root of gratitude, ' gratia ', translates to include the idea of being thankful. This, thankfulness, can be directed either at others for their help or at events (a beautiful day). Consistent with this gratitude is conceptualized in the scientific literature as either an emotional response to other's kindness (benefit -triggered gratitude), a mood referred to as generalized gratitude that focuses on the appreciation of what is valued and cherished in life (e.g., a beautiful day or good friends) (Lambert et al., 2009; McCullough et al., 2002), Chapter 2 39 or as a disposition reflecting a wider life orientation towards appreciating others and the world we live in (Adler & Fagley, 2005; Wood et al., 2010). Although, gratitude has been conceptualized in a variety of ways it has been frequently associat ed with a variety of social and personal benefits including improved physical and mental health (Lavelock et al., 2016; Ware, Kosinski, & Keller, 1996), general well-being (Froh et al., 2011;Wood, Joseph, 2004a; Steindl -Rast, 2004). Although the literature linking gratitude to health and well -being has been reviewed (see Lavelock et al., 2016 ; Wood et al., 2010) there is no systematic review of the link with prosociality. A systematic review a nd synthesis of this link is important for two main reasons. First, gratitude is key to understanding mechanisms (e.g., reciprocity) that underlie the survival of altruism in the population (Nowak, 2006; Nowak & Sigmund, 2005). Thus, exploring the sensiti vity of the gratitude -prosociality link to key theoretical distinction (e.g., direct vs. indirect reciprocity) will provide valuable theoretical insights. Second, given both the individual (better health) and societal (increased prosociality) benefits of g ratitude, interventions are increasingly been designed to enhance gratitude (see Emmons and McCullough, 2003). However, recently the effectiveness of such intervention had been questioned (Davis et al., 2016; Renshaw & Olinger Steeves, 2016; Wood et al., 2 010). One potential explanation for this low efficacy is a lack of understanding about which theoretical factors are most likely to enhance gratitude -outcome links. Should interventions for example highlight direct or indirect reciprocity? Thus, this meta -analysis will offer insights into ways of enhancing gratitude Chapter 2 40 interventions to increase prosociality, which also is known to enhance well - being (Weinstein, DeHaan, & Ryan, 2010; Weinstein & Ryan, 2010). 2.1.2. Gratitude and Pr osociality Drawing on the conceptual and theoretical overlaps in the way prosociality has been defined previously prosociality is defined here as a broad range of behaviours, effort or intentions designed to benefit, promote or protect the well -being of an other individual, group, organization or society (Bolino & Grant, 2016; Dovidio, Piliavin, Schroeder, & Penner, 2006 ; George 1992; Martin & Olson, 2015; Penner, Dovidio, Piliavin, & Schroeder, 2005) . There are a number of potential theoretical mec hanisms proposed to explain the gratitude -prosociality link and these are discussed below . First, gratitude may act as a moral motivator that underlies direct and indirect reciprocity (Fredrickson, 2004a, 2004b; McCullough et al., 2008; Nowak & Roch, 2007) . The principle of reciprocity is fundamental to explaining the survival of altruism in the population (Nowak, 2006). Reciprocity can be divided into direct and indirect reciprocity. Direct reciprocity occurs when the helper (A) is directly repaid by the recipient (B) at some later date (A helps B, B repays A). Thus, both parties benefit, leading to sustained prosociality. Direct reciprocity is only effective, however, when the helper and rec ipient are known to each other and can meet subsequently. When this is not possible indirect reciprocity offers another mechanism for the survival of prosociality (Nowak, 2006). Indirect reciprocity comes in two flavours: downstream and upstream (Sigmund, 2010). Downstream indirect reciprocity occurs when the helper (A) gains reputation from helping a recipient (B) and this reputation gain increases the probability that they (A) will Chapter 2 41 be helped by others (C) in the future (Nakamura & Masuda, 2011) . Upstream indirect reciprocity occurs when the recipient to help (B) from a benefactor (A) goes on to help someone else (C) (A helps B, then B helps C) (Nowak & Roch, 2007; Nowak & Sigmund, 2005). Gratitude as a moral motivator is a potential mechanism in all three forms of reciprocity (direct, downstream and upstream), but in particular upstream indirect reciprocity ( Nowak & Roch, 2007; Nowak & Sigmund, 2005 ). McCullough and associates (McCullough et al., 2001; McCullough et al., 2008; McCullough & Tsang, 2004; McCu llough, Tsang, & Roberts, 2004) argued that gratitude operates to promote prosociality via three moral functions: barometer , motivator and reinforcer . As a moral barometer gratitude highlights to the recipients that they have been helped and, as a moral motivator it motivates the recipient to act prosocially toward either their benefactor (direct reciprocity) or other people (upstream indirect reciprocity). Indeed, Nowak and Roch (2007) explicitly link the two, suggesting that upstream indirect reci procity ' hitchhikes ' on the back of direct reciprocity, with direct reciprocity acting as the main mechanism for the evolution of prosociality (cooperation in their model). Finally, as a moral reinforcer, gratitude encourages continued generosity. It is le ss clear how gratitude operates for downstream indirect reciprocity, where reputation building is the main mechanism. However, Ferguson (2015) argues that gratitude can still operate here when the prosocial act is towards a group or organi sation (e.g., charity). Consistent with the above, gratitude as an emotion has been shown to promote all 3 forms of reciprocity: (1) upstream indirect reciprocity (e.g. Chang et al., 2012; Halali et al., 2016), (2) direct reciprocity (e.g. Hendrickson & Chapter 2 42 Goei, 2009; Tsang, Schulwitz, & Carlisle, 2012 ), and Langan (2004b) Broaden -and-Build Theory of positive emotions postulates that positive emotions (e.g., gratitude) broaden an individual's momentary repertoire of cognitions and actions which promote enhanced social bonds and help the individual to build personal physical and mental resources. Fo llowing this reasoning , gratitude may function to enhance social ties and resources that people can subsequently rely on for help when experiencing difficulty (Emmons & Mishra, 2011). As such, gratitude that is triggered by others, as opposed to generalize d gratitude about what is personally valued (Lambert et al., 2009; Lambert & Fincham, 2011) should show a stronger association with prosociality. That is, the prosocial response to others is likely to strengthen close social bonds ( direct reciprocity) or i ndicate that the person is worthy of help in the future ( indirect reciprocity). Third, cultural norms are known to play a major role in the expression of prosocial behaviour (G\u00e4chter & Schulz, 2016) and emotions (Kim & Sasaki, 2014). One important cultural norm with respect to gratitude -prosociality is collectivism. Higher levels of collectivism are linked to greater levels of prosociality (Lampridis & Papastylianou, 2014) and gratitude is linked to collectivist ideals that emphasi se the maintenance of group harmony and reciprocity (Kee, Tsai, & Chen, 2008 ). It follows that in more collectivist cultures people should be more likely to experience and respond to gratitude with prosocial acts. Thus , a stronger gratitude -prosociality association should be expected in more collectivist cultures . Chapter 2 43 Fourth, cultural norms of religiosity may offer another explanation of the strength of gratitude -prosociality link. There is evidence that gratitude is associated with higher levels of religiosi ty (see Emmons & Mishra, 201 1; Li & Chow, 2015 ) and religious observance is associated with prosociality (Henrich et al., 2010). Thus, at an individual level religiosity should mediate the gratitude -prosociality link. As many world religions endorse doctri nes that support both gratitude, reciprocity and helping via Golden Rules (e.g. \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\" Mathew, 7:12, New International Version), one may also expect that the gratitude -prosociality will be more culturally embedd ed for countries where religiosity is higher. Therefore, from the perspective of cultural norms of religiosity the gratitude -prosociality association should be stronger in countries with higher levels of religiosity. Fifth, gratitude may be linked to pros ociality via a third variable, with other prosocial dispositions (e.g., Agreeableness) known to be associated with prosociality (Zhao & Smillie, 2015) a strong candidate third variable. Indeed, while gratitude has been shown to be associated with other pro social traits including empathy (Kruger, 2011; McCullough et al., 2002) and forgiveness (Carlisle & Tsang, 2013; Satici, Uysal, & Akin, 2014), there is no systematic evaluation of the strength of the association between gratitude and prosocial disposition in general. Showing that gratitude is linked to other prosocial traits will offer some initial evidence that, at least for the trait gratitude -prosociality link, other prosocial dispositions may act as a confounder linking the two . Despite evidence supporting the link between gratitude and prosociality , and the theoretical reasons outline d above, there is considerable inconsistency regarding the strength of the association. For instance, Soscia Chapter 2 44 (2007) reports a strong correlation bet ween customer perceived gratitude and their propensity to recommend the store to friends ( r = 0.78, p <.01), while Watkins and colleagues (2006) report a more modest association ( r = 0.34, p <.05) between gratitude and direct reciprocity. These differences may reflect both different types of prosociality as well as different domains (i.e. commercial and general). To date, there is no comprehensive quantitative review of the findings of how gratitude and prosociality are related to one another and what the s alient moderator(s) of this association might be. 2.1.3. Gratitude and the Other Prosocial Emotions Although this review focuses primarily on gratitude and its moderators, it is acknowledged that gratitude is not the only pro -social emotion. Nowak and Roch (2007) contend that other positive emotions can also evolve to support cooperation, but gratitude has particular theoretical importance for reciprocit y. Furthermore, McCullough et al. (2008) suggest that gratitude has a wider impact on prosociality than other emotions as it supports high-cost helping. As such, gratitude should have a larger overall effect size (as it contributes more to all forms of pro sociality - low and high cost) than other prosocial emotions. Thus, I intend to compare the effect size of the gratitude -prosociality link with effect sizes with the other specific prosocial emotions as well as general Positive Affect (PA) and Negative Aff ect (NA). This will also provide valuable information about which prosocial emotions to target interventions. If gratitude has a larger effect size than other prosocial emotions, then gratitude would appear a reasonable focus for interventions. Other key p rosocial emotions were identified primarily from the Appraisal Tendency Framework (ATF) of emotions (See Ferrer, Klein, Lerner, Chapter 2 45 Reyna, & Keltner, 2016 ; Lerner & Keltner, 2000). The ATF approach moves beyond exploring just the valence of emotions (NA versus PA) and differentiates among emotions in terms of their appraisal dimensions, such as certainty (e.g. the emotion arises as a consequence of a predic table stimuli) and personal control (e.g., the emotion arises as a consequence of actions/cognition under the person 's personal control). The ATF identifies seven specific emotions with a relationship to prosociality: gratitude , hope , pride , surprise , anger , guilt, and sadness (Ferrer et al., 2016). 2.1.3.1. Hope , Sadness , and Anger Hope refers to a desire for the person to have a better future for themselves and/or others, with the belief that this is achievable. Indeed, hope for a better future is one of the main motives given for volunteering in early stage clinical trials (Catt, Langr idge, Fallowfield, Talbot, & Jenkins, 2011 ). Sadness is a key to the Negative State Relief (NSR) model of prosociality (Cialdini et al., 1987; Cialdini et al., 1997). The NSR model suggests people help to manage their own negative mood arising from observi ng another person's suffering. Finally, anger is a crucial motivator that underlies the punishment of free -riders to preserve group cooperation (Fehr & Fischbacher, 2004; G\u00fcrerk et al., 2006). That is, one major threat to prosociality is free - riding, whereby people gain a relative advantage by not helping at the expense of another's good deeds. When there is an option to punish free -riding \u2014even if this is not implemented \u2014cooperation increases (Skatova & Ferguson, 2013 ). 2.1.3.2. Pride , Guilt , and Shame Pride is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as a \" feeling of deep pleasure or satisfaction derived from one's own achievement\". To link pride to Chapter 2 46 prosociality it is necessary to distinguish hubristic (pride linked to arrogance and conceit) from authentic pride (linked to achievement), with authentic pride linked to prosociality (Carver, Sinclair, & Johnson, 2010; Tracy & Robins, 2007 ). Both guilt and shame (Amodio, Devine, & Harmon -Jones, 2007 ) are moral emotions, with guilt a more private and sh ame a more public self -focused emotion (Amodio et al., 2007; Scheff, 2000; Tangney, 1995). It is argued that individuals are motivated to avoid the guilt for not acting prosocially or the shame of acting selfishly (Saito, 2015) and indeed, both guilt and shame have been shown to lead to increased prosociality (Allpress, Brown, Giner -Sorolla, Deonna, Steinberg, & Grev , 1980; Miller, 2009). While specific emotions are linked to prosociality there is evidence that both general PA and NA motivate prosociality (see Ferguson, 2016). People may act prosocially to maintain PA and manage and reduce NA ( Cialdini et al., 1987; Cialdini & Fultz, 1990; Ferguson, 2016). Thus, as well as exploring if gratitude has a stronger link to prosociality than specific emotions I also examine if the gratitude -prosociality link was stronger than for PA and NA . 2.1.4. Moderators of the Gratitude -Prosociality Association Below I detail the predictions from the five main theoretical moderators of the gratitude -prosociality link (reciprocity, social relationships, collectivism, religiosity and associations with prosocial dispositions ) as well as exploring if the gratitude -prosociality association is stronger for state or dispositional gratitude . A number of methodological moderators will be examined as well. 2.1.4.1. Theoretical Moderators and Predictions i.) Reciprocity . Above I argued that gratitude is a potential mechanism in all forms of reciprocity (direct, downstream and upstream). Thus, I predict the Chapter 2 47 gratitude -prosociality link will be stronger for studies that focus on reciprocity (direct , downstream and upstream ) compared to studies that did not. I further examine whether the gratitude -prosociality link will be a stronger for studies that focus on direct as opposed to indirect (i.e. downstream and upstream) reciprocity. Despite the fact that gratitude has the capacity to incite all forms of reciproci ty, it is less likely to be a central mechanism for downstream indirect reciprocity . Thus I would expect to observe a stronger gratitude -prosociality link for direct versus overall (downstream plus upstream) indirect reciprocity. Within indirect reciprocit y I expect the gratitude -prosociality link to be stronger for upstream compared to downstream indirect reciprocity . ii.) Social Relationships . As the prosocial response to others is likely to strengthen close social bonds ( direct reciprocity) or indicate that the person is worthy of future help ( indirect reciprocity) , I expect that gratitude that is triggered by others ( benefit -triggered ), as opposed to generalized gratitude (Lambert et al., 2009), should have a stronger association with prosociality. iii.) Country of participants, Religiosity and Collectivism . Gratitude may be linked to prosociality via increased levels of religiosity, thus the gratitude - prosociality link should be greater in countries with higher levels of religiosity. I explored this by examining the level of religiosity within each country in which each study took place. Likewise, I predict that the gratitude -prosociality link will be stronger in more collectivist countries where gratitude and reciprocity are stronger cultural norms, again because the expression of gratitude and its link to prosociality are encouraged and supported . iv.) Gratitude -Prosociality and Other Prosocial Dispositions . Gratitude (especially dispositi onal gratitude) may be linked to prosociality simply Chapter 2 48 because it is associated with other prosocial dispositions such as agreeableness. Indeed, there is evidence linking tra it gratitude to other prosocial dispositions (e.g. Kruger, 2011; McCullough et al., 2002). However, this link has not been systematically examined. As a first step to explore this potential mechanism for dispositional gratitude it is necessary to establish if there is a reliable association between dispositional gratitude and other prosoc ial dispositions . v.) Gratitude Measure \u2014Emotion, Mood and Disposition . Gratitude can be viewed either as a state (encompassing emotional reactions and mood) or as a disposition (Parrott, 2001). Gratitude as an emotion occurs when an individual is helped by another person, especially if the help was intentional (Emmons & Shelton, 2002; Fredrickson, 2004a; Lazarus & Lazarus, 1996 ), and the recipient did nothing to earn that help (Bertocci & Millard , 1963; Emmons, 2004 ). Emmons and McCullough (2003) also defined gratitude as a mood reflecting neutral daily events like 'waking up in the morning (pp.379)' . These distinctions map onto Lambert et al.'s (2009) distinction between benefit -triggered (being grateful to someone) and generalized gratitude (grateful for valued and cherished events and people in our lives). With respect to trait gratitude , Wood et al. (2010) define it within a life-affirming process as 'noticing and appreciating the positive in the world' (p 891) so as a tendency to experience gratitude in response to others ' kindness. Although there is a large evidence base for the link between state gratitude and prosociality, Wood and coll eagues (2008) highlighted a paucity of empirical evidence for the link between trait gratitude and prosociality . I, therefore, examined the effect sizes for both state and trait gratitude . To do this I grouped both aspects of state gratitude (emotion/benefit triggered and Chapter 2 49 generalized /mood) as a single category. As the trait instantiation of gratitude includes both aspects of gratitude, I believe that the comparison between state and disposition is more justified by equating the conc eptualization of the two. Based on the Social Cognitive Model of Gratitude (SCMG) (Wood et al., 2008) and Trait Activation Theory (Tett & Guterman, 2000) I predict that the effect size for state gratitude will be stronger than for the trait gratitude . The SCMG suggests that state gratitude forms an indirect path between trait gratitude and prosociality . This indicates that trait gratitude should be a more distal and weaker direct predictor of prosociality compared to the more proximal state it triggers (see also Ferguson, 2013). Indeed, this pattern of a weaker association between a trait than an emotion with respect to a specific outcome is observed by others (see Fredrickson, Tugade, Waugh & Larkin, 2003) . Furthermore, the principle of trait activation suggests that any behavioural expression, such as prosociality, linked to a trait requires activation of the trait by trait relevant cues (See Tett & Guterman, 2000). Thus, the assessment of a trait alone should not suffice to fully activate trait tendenci es. 2.1.4.2. Methodological Moderators and Predictions A few methodological factors which may influence the gratitude - prosoci ality association were examined. They included, i) gratitude induction, ii) objectivity of prosociality assessment, iii) target of prosociality \u2014individual versus group , iv) gratitude measure \u2014proxy versus actual . i.) Gratitude Induction: Laboratory -Studies (Vignettes & Experimental/Economic Games) versus Surveys/Field Studies . I explored whether laboratory -studies , which use a direct exogenous manipulation of gratitude (e.g. Exline, Lisan, & Lisan, 2012; Tsang, 2007 ) or Chapter 2 50 Survey/Field Studies, where participants completed a cross -sectional battery of gratitude and prosociality measures (e.g. Li & Chow, 2015 ; McCullough et al., 2002 ), resulted in a larger effect size. I further delved into a subtle distinction within lab -studies: Vignettes (e.g. Graham, 1988; Xia & Kukar -Kinner, 2013) versus Experimental/ Economic Games (e.g. Halali et al., 2016; Tsang, 2006a). There are several practical advantages in applying the vignette technique. For instance, it is cost-effective and can be easily sta ndardised (Alexander & Becker, 1978; Gould, 1996; Hughes & Huby, 2002). However, the lack of participant involvement in the vignettes may lead participants to simply respond in terms of normative theories of gratitude (Hegtvedt, 1990; Tsang, 2006b; Weiner, Russell, & Lerman, 1979 ). On the other hand, experimental manipulations/economic games involve laboratory inductions in which participants take an active role . For example, participants might be asked to recall an experience of being generously treated by others (e.g., Siegel, Thomson, & Navarro, 2014); or in an economic game where participants experienced gratitude after receiving a financial benefit (e.g. Leung, 2011) . Experimental /economic game induced gratitude should better reflect the participants' genuinely experienced emotion, relative to vignette -induced gratitude, because of the higher extent of involvemen t (Levine & Moreland, 2004 ). As a result, I anticipate a stronger gratitude -prosociality association for experimental/economic game studies, compared to vignette studies . ii.) Objective -Subjective Assessments of Prosociality . I examined whether the prosociality assessment involved an actual expenditure of effort or money (objective); or whether it used self- or peer -reported behaviour or intention to act prosocially (subjective). Given that subjective tendencies do not always Chapter 2 51 translate into actua l behaviours (Ajzen, 1985, 1991; Ajzen & Madden, 1986), I expect that studies which examined prosociality subjectively to show a stronger link with gratitude than studies where prosociality was assessed objectively . iii.) Target of Prosociality \u2014Individual versus Group . Algoe et al. (2008) reported that gratitude enhances both dyadic and group relationships. Furthermore, the definition of prosociality I adopt ed entails helping individuals and groups equally. Thus, it remains unaddressed whether gratitude -inspired prosociality would function similarly when targeted as an individual or a group . iv.) Gratitude Measure \u2014Proxy versus Actual . Several studies employ proxy measu res of gratitude. For example, Naito and associates (Naito & Sakata, 2010; Naito, Wangwan, & Tani, 2005) examined feelings of joy, warmth and helpfulness after receiving help. Considering that a proxy measure is by definition an approximate assessment (Kisch, Kovner, Harris, & Kline, 1969) , it is logical to assume that it should, compared to a direct assessment, constitute a greater discrepancy between the operational and the conceptual definition of gratitude thus resulting in lower validity (Carver & Sche ier, 2008). Therefore, I endeavour to examine if studies that employed proxy measures of gratitude would have smaller effect sizes compared to studies which adopted a direct assessment of participant's gratitude . v.) Age. As there may be developmental tren ds with respect to experiencing gratitude and the chance to be prosocial I include age as a continuous covariate . 2.2 Methods 2.2.1. Main Analyses: Gratitude -Prosociality Association 2.2.1.1. Search Strategies Chapter 2 52 Studies were identified by searching electronic databases (Science, Social Science and general scholarly databases, including ISI Web of Science, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, Scopus, EconLit, Google Scholar, British Library EThOS , Applied Social Science Index & Abstracts (ASSIA), Business Source Premier (EBSCO), and Dissertation Online) and the reference lists from relevant articles. The following search terms for the main meta -analysis on Gratitude the initial screening phase the abstracts and titles of potentially relevant articles ( N = 746) were examined, with 420 duplicated entries removed. The full text of the remaining articles was inspected ( N = 326), and thereby eliminated entries ( N = 257) that were inconsistent with the eligibility criteria (see Sub-section 2.2.1.2 ). Furthermor e, I examined the papers in order to remove entries that shared the same dataset, such as multiple analyses conducted with an identical dataset. Finally, I contacted authors for additional data where whose articles were published (or available online/publi shed as book chapters for unpublished work) within the last five years that did not include sufficient information for the effect sizes to be computed. 2.2.1.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria The following inclusion criteria were used to select studies. First, the search was confined to papers written in English . Second, I did not impose any age limit on the participants in the present review but included age as a continuous moderating variable instead . Third, all studies had to involve primary and secondary measures of the relationship between gratitude (as a Chapter 2 53 disposition or a state) and prosociality (e.g. behavioural intention or overt behaviours). Finally, only studies that reported quantitati ve findings were included . Applying all these inclusion and exclusion criteria 65 papers with a grand total of 18, 342 participants, consisting of 91 studies and 252 effect sizes were identified . Figure 2.1 provides the information flow diagram prepared based on the PRISMA Statement (Liberati et al., 2009). Figure 2.1 .

Working Definition of the Methodological and Theoretical Moderators Moderators Codes Working Definition Examples in the current sample Theoretical Moderator: Reciprocity versus No reciprocity Non-Reciprocity (k = 16) Studies which i) measured the effect of gratitude on prosocial behaviour s (or behaviour al intention) that were not concerned about repaying a benefit received, or ii) were survey -based i) Participants assigned to the on -going gratitude training session were to indicate 'each day if they had helped someone with a problem or offered someone emotional support (pp. 382)' - (Study 2, Emmons and McCullough, 2003 ) Reciprocity (k = 76) Studies whose measures of prosocial behaviour s or intentions involved: i) Direct Reciprocity: a direct return of favours to the benefactors \u2014 an 'A helps B and B helps A' scenario (Novak & Sigmund, 2007); ii) 'Downstream' Indirect Reciprocity: individuals acting prosocially towards those they observed to help others \u2014 an 'A helps B, and C helps A' scenario (Novak & Sigmund, 2007); iii) 'Upstream' Indirect Reciprocity: individuals acting prosocially to a th ird-party after receiving a favour from someone else \u2014an 'A helps B, and B helps C' scenario (Novak & Sigmund, 2007); i) 'Direct Reciprocity': Participants of the 'Favour' Condition decided how much money (i.e. USD $10) to distribute to their benefactors in the previous round. -(Tsang et al., 2012); ii) 'Downstream' Indirect Reciprocity: Participants of the 'experimental' condition read a vignette of a fictitious company engaging in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) investment (e.g. being environmental ly-friendly, concern for fair trade, employees' safety and human rights preservation etc.). Participants then rated how grateful or thankful they felt towards that company for her CSR investment, and indicated how likely they would reward her via 'positive word of mouth' and 'advocacy behaviour s' -(Romani et al., 2013) iii) 'Upstream' Indirect Reciprocity: Participants recalled a time being treated very generously, and then decided whether to donate their participation allowance to a local charity for children. - (Study 2, Siegel et al., 2014) Direct Reciprocity (k = 53) See the definition above. See the example above. Indirect Reciprocity (k = 16) See the definitions above. Owing to the relatively small counts of both downstream ( k = 5) and upstream ( k = 9) studies, together with two studies whose outcomes concerned both types of indirect reciprocities, I combined all these to form a category Indirect Reciprocity in the main analyses. See the example above. Blank Entries (k = 10) Outcomes involved both direct and indirect reciprocities, but the authors did not specifically Refer to the above -mentioned example of an 'ambiguously - targeted' prosociality measure (i.e. Nai to et al., 2005). Chapter 2 55 report how gratitude was related to each type of reciprocities. Theoretical Moderator: Social Relationships (Lambert et al., 2009) Benefit -triggered Gratitude (k = 69) The gratitude that results from a specific 'interpersonal transfer of benefit from a beneficiary to a benefactor. (pp. 1194)' Participants' gratitude towards a confederate who unexpectedly offered the former a soda. -(e.g. Study 1, Goei & Boster, 2005); Patron's -tasting -(e.g. Kolyesnikova & Dodd, 2008) Generalized Gratitu de (k = 19) An emotion, or an affective state, which stems from the appreciation of things which 'are meaningful and valuable to oneself. (pp. 1194)' Gratitude Induction: 'Think back over the past week and write down on the lines below up to five things in your life that you are grateful or thankful for. (pp. 379)' -(Emmons & McCullough, 2003) Theoretical Moderator: Country of Participations, Religiosity and Collectivism Continents (k = 91) I categori sed the 91 studies from 16 countries (or regions) on a continental basis. Fifty -five studies were conducted in North America , along with 23 in Asia and 13 in Western Europe . 'North America': Studies that were conducted in the United States of America (e.g. Goei & Boster, 2005) or Canada (e.g. Spence et al., 2014); 'Asia': Studies that were conducted in China (e.g. Tian, et al., 2016), Japan (e.g. Naito & Sakata, 2010), India (e.g. Dewani et al., 2016), South Korea (e.g. Kim & Lee, 2013), Israel (e.g. Halali et al., 2016), Hong Kong (e.g. Zhao, 2010), Thailand (e.g. Wangwan, 2014), or Taiwan (e.g. Chang et al, 2012). 'Western Europe': Studies conducted in the United Kingdom (e.g. Ma, et al., 2014), Germany (e.g. Wetzel et al., 2014), France (e.g. Simon, 2013), Netherlands (e.g. de Hooge, 2014), Italy (e.g. Soscia, 2007) and Norway (e.g. Xie et al., 2015). Religiosity I coded the level of religiosity using the G allup (2014) Int ernational religiosity Index. In particular, the percentage of people from a country identifying themselves as, regardless of whether they attend a place of worship or not, of America: 56%. (No data was provided for Norway and Taiwan) Collectivism I coded the level of collectivism via Hofstede' s (Hofstede, et al., 2010) Individualism - Collectivism index. A higher score indicates higher likelihood of people defining their self - image as 'I' instead of 'we' 91. Chapter 2 56 Theoretical Moderator: Gratitude Measures State/Mood (k = 77) Gratitude examined or induced as a i) positive emotion upon receipt of an intentional, valued benefit (Tsang, 2006a, 2007) ; or ii) a mood over a designated period of time. i) Participants rated survey items such as 'I am happy to have been helped by others,' and 'I have benefi ted from the goodwill of others.' -(Study 2, Spence et al., 2014); ii) Participants rated the amount of gratitude they 'experienced \"since yesterday\". (pp.637) -(Froh et al., 2009) Disposition (k = 24) Gratitude examined as an enduring characteristic of thankfulness that is sustained across contexts and over time (Chan, 2013; McCullough et al., 2002) Participants to rate themselves using the GQ -VI (McCullough et al., 2002). The sample items included 'I am grateful to a variety of people; As I get older I find myself more able to appreciate people' - (e.g. Tian et al., 2015) Methodological Moderator: Type of Study (Lab -Studies vs. Survey /Field Studies). Lab-Studies (k = 59) Studies which employed a direct, exogenous manipulation (or induction) of parti cipants' gratitude mood or affective states. I further classified THESE studies under this code into two sub-categories: 1) Experimental/ Economic Games , and 2) Vignette. 'Experimental/ Economic Games ': Participants assigned to the 'Gratitude' condition re ceived a favour from a confederate while working on a tedious task. They then decided whether to help that confederate fill out a time -consuming survey for that confederate. -(Study 1, Bartlett & Desteno, 2006); 'Vignette ': Participants read a vignette abo ut a student, who struggled to find the past papers to prepare for his/her admission exam, who was offered the materials by a current graduate student of that programme named Zhang. A year later, the protagonist gets into the programme thanks to Zhang's he lp and learns that Zhang now needs help. Participants then indicated how eager they were to help Zhang back assuming they were that protagonist. -(Study 2, Yang et al., 2015) Survey /Field Studies (k = 32) Studies in which participants completed a battery of questionnaires (i.e. Survey Study). Studies involving manipulation of variables other than gratitude , but included peripheral measures on participant's gratitude (i.e. Field Study) were also coded as a ' Survey/Field study' in the present analysis. 'Survey Study ': Participants filled out a series of questionnaires including the Religiousness Scale (Strayhorn et al., 1990), Spirituality Scale (Delaney, 2005), in addition to the trait gratitude (i.e. GQ -VI) and prosocial behaviour s measures (e.g. Peer -helping behaviour scale (Crick, 1996) and Child Altruism Inventory (Ma & Leung, 1991)). -(Li & Chow, 2015); 'Field Study ': A between -subject video vignette study which examined the effec t of Socio -Economic Statuses (janitor versus doctor) and Favours (whether or not the protagonist had bought a drink for his 'target') on compliance with a date request. Participants imagined themselves as the recipient of a date Chapter 2 57 request, and were asked to rate how grateful, appreciative, or thankful they felt towards the protagonist throughout the episode. -(Hendreickson & Goei, 2009) Experimental/ Economic Games (k = 34) Laboratory Induction: Participants were asked to recall being grateful. Economic G ames: Participants' gratitude was triggered by a co-player's conferment of a financial benefit in the course of an economic exchange. 'Laboratory Induction': Participants recalled an incident whereby 'another person did something for you that was very kind. (pp.47)' -(Exline et al., 2012) Vignette (k = 25) A hypothetical scenario or story in which participants were induced to feel grateful as the protagonist was treated generously by someone. Refer to the above examples of 'Lab Studies' (e.g. Yang e t al., 2015). Methodological Moderator: Objective versus Subjective Prosociality Assessment Objective (k = 30) Prosociality assessments that involved an actual expenditure of effort or money (or other money - equivalent resources). Amount of money (i.e. a $5-dollar note) to distribute to 'another participants who will be in the study at a later time (pp.213)' -(Study 2 , Exline and Hill, 2012;) Subjective ( = 62) Studies which assessed self-, or peer-reported prosocial behaviour s, or one's intention to act prosocially to others. Customer Purchase Intentions: 1) 'I would be very likely to buy something today'; 2) I would come back to this store.' 3) 'I would likely buy from this store in the future.' (7 -point scales) -(Palmatier et al., 2009) Metho dological Moderator : Target of Prosociality: Individual versus Group Individual (k = 44) Reciprocal, prosocial or cooperative acts or behaviour al intentions that were directed toward an individual recipient. Each participant decided how many raffle tickets of his/hers to distribute to his/her in-game partner. -(e.g. Tsang, 2006a, 2007) Group (k = 34) Participants' decisions to show appreciation to a group or organisation by i) behaving prosocially toward or ii) harbouring an intention to benefit that organisation in the future. i) Children participants were given a chance to write a thank - you card to the Parent -Teacher Association for their provision of a multimedia presentation. -(Froh et al., 2014); ii) Loyalty \u2014Advocacy (Lam, Shankar, Erramili & Murthy, 2004): will friends to use this bank's services' and 'I will recommend this bank to others.' (7 -point scales) -(Study 1 and 2, Xia and Kukar -Kinney, 2013) Ambiguous (k = 15) Studies which provided i) insufficient information to judge whether prosociality was individually - or group - directed, or ii) studies whose measures of i) Participants' weekly recor d of their 'acts of kindness for others (pp.4)' -(Layous et al., 2016); ii) Participants' ratings on the following items were combined to form an overall 'enhanced prosocial behaviour s measure': a) Chapter 2 58 individual and group helping were combined into a single index of helping. 'Do you want to help your father (i.e. the benefactor in t he vignette) if he needs help in similar or other situations?', and b) 'Do you want to help others if they help in similar or other situations?' -(pp. 251, Naito et al., 2005) Methodological Moderator : Gratitude Measures: Actual versus Proxy Actual (k = 82) Studies which adopted a direct or a 'real' measure or induction of gratitude as a state, mood or a disposition. Customer' Gratitude Scale (adapted from Goei & Boster, a sense of gratitude toward company'. (9 -point scale) - (pp. 607, Simon, 2013); Participants reported a personal experience in which they felt grateful toward someone. - (de Hooge, 2014) Proxy (k = 14) Studies which employed an indirect or a 'surrogate' measure of gratitude. 'Positive Responses' evoked by being 'Delighted' Wangwan, 2014) Methodological Moderator: Published or not? Times cited, Years of Publications and Participa nt Age Published? (k = 91) I included a 'yes'/ 'no' code on whether the study had been published. Yes ( k = 72) Published journal articles Tsang (2006 a, 2007) No (k = 19) Doctoral theses, Book chapters, and Raw Data collected Doctoral Theses: Langan & Kumar Data Collected; Ma, Tunney & Ferguson (2015) Times Cited I included the times cited metrics (accurate as of 4th August 2016) that are provided by either the Web of Science or Google Scholar. Years of Publication I included the year of publication (or availability) of the sampled articles/studies data. Participant Age Sixty -one studies reported the average or the median age range of their participants. I imputed the average age of the 23 studies which only described their sample compositions (i.e. undergraduates) by taking mid -point of the usual age range of the undergraduate student population: 18 -24 years (i.e. 21 .0 years). Six studies did not provide any age data. 'Mean age given': 12.14 -(Froh et Psychology stude Huang (2015); Soscia (2007) Sensitivity Analysis: Zero -order? Yes (k = 74) Zero -order figures (e.g. correlation rs, independent sample t-values etc.) used to compute the effect estimates. 'Zero -order Correlation rs' - (e.g. Bock et al., 2016); 'Independent samples T -test t -values' (e.g. Hwang & Kandampully, 2015) Chapter 2 59 No (k = 18) Imputation of effect sizes from a specific gratitude -prosociality path in a multiple -path model (e.g. M ultiple Regressions, Structural Equation Regressions': Chapter 2 60 i.) Reciprocity versus Non -reciprocity and Reciprocity Nature . I coded whether the prosociality measures reported were reciprocally driven or not. Reciprocity (k = 76) was defined as an individual's attempt (or motivation) to respond to a positive action with another positive action. These were further differentiated i nto Direct Reciprocity ( k = 53), that refers to the direct reciprocation of favours received and 2) Indirect Reciprocity ( k = 16) that included both 'downstream' (the individual acts prosocially to someone whom they know to have helped a someone else previ ously k = 5), and 'upstream' (the individual acts prosocially to a third party after being helped by someone else k = 9). Ten studies that examined both direct and indirect reciprocity but did not separately report how gratitude was associated with each ty pe of reciprocity (e.g. Desteno et al., 2010) were excluded from the analysis that focused on the distinction between direct and indirect reciprocity . I also coded studies that examined prosocial acts or behavioural intentions that were not driven by a need to repay (e.g. Study 1, McCullough et al., 2002) as involving Non-Reciprocity (k = 16) (See Table 1 for details). ii.) Social Relationships . I coded benefit -triggered gratitude as any emotional ly felt gratitude in response to another's help (state measures only, k = 69) and that generalized gratitude as an appreciation of valued people, and events in life assessed as both a state and trait ( k = 19, see Table 1). iii.) Country of participations, religiosity and collectivism . Altogether sixteen countries are represented. I categori sed these countries initially on a continental basis (see Table 1). The majority of the studies were conducted in North America (k = 55), along with Western Europe (k = 13), Asia (k = 23). Each country in the sample was also coded for its level of religiosity using the Gallup Chapter 2 61 (2014) International Religiosity Index and collectivism using the scoring procedures of Hofstede, Hofstede, and Minkov (2010). iv.) Gratitude Measure \u2014State/Mood versus Disposition . In the present review I grouped studies that examined gratitude as either a state or a mood under the category State/Mood (k = 77) or as a disposition (k = 24) (see Table 1). v.) Gratitude Induction: Experiments versus Surveys . Studies were divided into Laboratory Studies (involving a direct manipulation to induce gratitude) (k = 59) and cross -sectional Surveys/Field Studies (k = 32). Lab studies were further sub-divided into: Experimental/Economic Games (k = 34), and Vignettes (k = 25). Studies that were coded as Vignettes typically triggered participants' feelings of gratitude via hypothetical scenarios in which a protagonist was (or was not) helped. Studies that were coded Experimental/Economic Games involved gratitude induction via either laboratory induction of recallin g being grateful or economic games during which one's gratitude was elicited via receiving a financial benefit in the course of an economic interaction . Illustrative examples are given in Table 1 . vi.) Objectivity of Prosocial Measure . I coded the objectiv ity of the prosocial measures reported. An objective measure ( k = 30) was defined as an actual expenditure of resources, time or effort and subjective measures ( k = 62) was referred to as a self -reported (or peer -reported) intentions to behave prosocially (i.e., without any actual commitment of resources) (Table 1) . vii.) Target of Prosociality \u2014Individual versus Group . I coded whether the prosocial behaviours or behavioural intentions reported were targeted at an individual , a group , or an ambiguous entity. An individually -directed ( k = 44) prosocial measure is illustrated by Tsang (2006a) in which each participant Chapter 2 62 decided how much to give to a specific co -player. By contrast, a group -directed (k= 34) prosocial measure is represented by the participa nts' decisions to show appreciation \u2014for example, by writing a 'thank -you' note (Froh et al., 2014) \u2014 towards a group. Several studies were coded as ambiguously -targeted ( k = 15) due to insufficient information. For example, if measures of individual and group helping were combined into a single index, or if the item was indexed helping in general while the authors did not designate this as either a group - or an individually - targeted act (see Table 1 for examples). viii.) Gratitude Measure \u2014Proxy versus Ac tual. I also coded whether the gratitude measurement used was a proxy or an actual measure. A Proxy measure ( k = 14) was defined as a surrogate, or indirect assessment of gratitude. In contrast, I defined an Actual measure ( k = 82) as a direct assessment o f gratitude as a state , mood or a disposition (see Table 1). ix.) Times Cited, Year of Publication and Age . First, for all the published studies I coded the number of times that each article had been cited. This figure was obtained by examining the times cited metrics provided by the databases used in the search (4th August 2016). To avoid double -counting I took the highest count metric available. Second, I included the years of publication (or availability) of the sampled articles/studies data ( M: 2010.8 7, SD: 4.88). The earliest publication I included was in the 1980s (Graham, 1988) while the latest one was e -published in June 2016 ((Layous, Nelson, Kurtz, & Lyubomirsky, 2016 ). For unpublished entries I recorded either the year in which the papers were available, or the year in which the studies were conducted . Chapter 2 63 I coded mean or median age of participants reported in each study . Where the only information was a sample description (e.g., American college students) I imputed the age for the average American college student (i.e. (18+24)/ 2= 21.0 years) in the year that the study was administered . 2.2.2. Additional Meta -analysis: Association Prosocial 2.2.2.1. Prosocial Dispositions To the association between dispositional gratitude and other prosocial dispositions I included the following additional search terms ('Agreeableness', 'Conscientiousness', ' Dispositional Empathy', and 'Forgiveness'). I included Conscientiousness as a prosocial disposition because there is evidence that it is associated with volunteering behaviours (Ferguson, 2004; Lodi -Smith & Roberts, 2007) along with Agreeableness which is associated with prosociality in general ( Ferguson, Gancarczyk, Wood, Delane y, & Corr, 2015 ; Zhao & Smillie, 2015). This resulted in 24 studies with 103 effect sizes with a total sample of 7,677 . 2.2.2.2. Other Prosocial Emotions To contextuali se the gratitude -prosociality association I compared that to association with the other prosocial emotions (i.e. hope, pride, surprise, anger, guilt, and sadness) as well a general Negative Affect (NA) and Positive Affect (PA). A number of existing meta -analyses were identified which addressed prosociality with respect to NA (Carlson & Miller, 1987; Dalal, 2005 ), PA (Carlson, Charlin, & Miller, 1988), guilt (Boster, Cruz, Manata, DeAngelis, & Zhuang, 2016), shame (Lech & Cidam, 2015), sadness (Carlson Chapter 2 64 & Miller, 1987), and happiness (Lyubomirsky, Kin g, & Diener, 2 005). To date I am yet to locate any meta -analysis for hope , surprise , anger and pride studies . Literature searches revealed 23 studies on pride The search for anger was limited to papers published after Van Door n and colleagues' (2014) review on anger and prosocial behaviour and all relevant papers (i.e. the 'direct evidence') from Van Doo rn et al. (2014) were included . With respect to anger the definition of prosociality was extended to include cooperation (givin g to the public good and contribution of resources, which did not include an option to punish non -cooperators) along with n orm- enforcing punishment , whereby non -cooperators are punished either by other players ( second party) or an impartial observer ( third party) at a cost to the punisher . Punishment of this type is believed to enforce norms of fairness, with the evidence showing that it leads to greater cooperation (Fehr & Fischbacher, 2004; Fehr & Rockenbach, 2004; G\u00fcrerk et al., 2004, 2006). Furthermore, Peysakhovich, Nowak, and Rand (2014) distinguished cooperation from norm enforcement as two clear and distinct aspects of the cooperative phenotype . Thus it seemed reasonable to distinguish the two. Two additional meta -analyses were conducted to estimate the overall effect sizes for pride and anger on prosocial Chapter 2 65 behaviours . The same set of inclusion and exclusion criteria as the main analyses were applied to these additional analyses. 2.2.3. Overview \u2014Data Synthesis, Meta -bias and Additional An alysis For the present review the correlation r was used as the effect -size metric. For studies that only reported the standardi sed s I had applied Peterson and Brown's (2005) \u2014r = + 0.05 (where = 1 for non -negative s, and = 0 for negative s)\u2014to impute the corresponding rs. I also computed r for studies that did not conduct correlational analyses via sample sizes along with t-values, 2 values, p-values, and standardi sed mean differences (i.e., Cohen's d). In addition, several measurements were reverse -scored to assure that each positive effect size computed would represent a direct association between gratitude and prosociality . The Random -effects model was adopted to calculate the overall effect size of gratitude on prosociality . Because the current sample contained studies conducted with noticeably different features I did not follow the Fixed -effects because this assumes that all the studies included are functionally identical and share a single canonical effect size (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2010; Hedges & Vevea, 1998 ). Additionally, the Random -effects model allows unconditional inferences (i.e., a generalizable conclusion to situations beyond the sampled studies) of the results (Field, 2001; Schmidt, Oh, & Hayes, 2009). Many studies were found to have reported multiple Gratitude - Prosociality metrics . It was not uncommon for studies to either include both state and dispositional assessment of gratitude alongside a single prosociality measure (e.g. Spence, Brown, Keeping, & Lian, 2014; Exline et al., 2012), or to have a single gratitude measure alongside multiple prosociality measures (e.g. Chapter 2 66 Watkins et al., 2006). These effect sizes that arise from the same study are not independent (Balliet, Mulder, & Van Lange, 2011; Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2009) . As a result, study was referred to as the unit of analysis meaning that each study included would contribute only one summary effect size to the analysis (see Cooper, 1998). The effect sizes were computed using Cooper's (1998) Shifting -Unit-of-Analysis method for studies which report multiple, non -independent effect sizes . Similar to Balliet and Van Lange's (2013) reporting, I detail the 95% Confidence Intervals alongside certain indices of heterogeneity assessment like I2, i.e. the cross -studies 'inconsistency index' (Higgins & Thompson, 2002; Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, & Altman, 2003), Cochran Q, and tau -squared (the 'study -to-study variances') (Borenstein et al., 2009). T he issue of publication bias was addressed via examining the funnel plot in which all effect sizes are plotted against the standard error. To empirically evaluate the extent of the symmetry of the funnel plot, and hence the severity of potential publication bias I examined the following indices, namely (1) the effect size estimates following Duval & Tweedie's (2000) Trim -and-Fill and (2) Egger's regression intercept (Egger, Smith, & Phillips, 1997). I applied the mixed -effects model in the categorical univariate moderator analyses (e.g., study type, reciprocity nature etc.) so as the meta - regression analyses for the continuous moderators (e.g. tim es cited and years of publication). It should, nevertheless, be noted that the application of mixed - effects model may, compared to a fixed -effect model, render the analyses over - conservative and therefore susceptible to Type II -errors (Balliet & Van Lange, 2013; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001 ). Chapter 2 67 All analyses in the present review were conducted using the Comprehensive Meta -Analysis (CMA) Version 2.0 (Borenstein et al., 2009). Meta -regression models , however, were conducted using CMA Version 3.0 (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2014) . As a number of effect sizes were derived from multivariate analyses (multiple regressions, path models, ANCOVA etc.), the effect sizes based on r may be over - or under -estimated . Therefore, I explored if the effect size estimat es would vary as a function of effect sizes that are zero -order (i.e. derived from univariate analyses) or derived from partial coefficients. Similar analyses had shown that it has the effect of generally reducing effect size estimates (Ferguson & Bibby, 2 012). 2.3 Results 2.3.1. Overall Analyses The list of effect sizes of the association between gratitude and prosociality and study characteristics are contained in Table 2 .2. The analysis revealed a moderate positive association between gratitude and prosociality, r = 0.374, 95% confidence interval lower limit (LLCI) /Upper limit (ULCI) = 0.329/0.417, p <.0001. I observed a non -negligible level of variation in the distribution of effect sizes (Tau = 0.232, Tau -squared = 0.054). This might be explained by the considerable extent of heterogeneity (i.e., I2 = 90.98; Q (90) = 998.16, p <.0001) inherent among the sampled studies. To address the extent to which publication bias may ha ve impacted upon the analysis I first examined the adjusted effect size estimates following Duval and Tweedie's (2000) Trim -and-Fill procedure using the Random -effects model. No studies were deemed missing below the average effect estimates. In contrast, f ifteen studies with imputed effect sizes greater than the mean effect Chapter 2 68 estimate were filled in, resulting in an effect estimate that was slightly higher than the pre -adjusted mean effect ( r = 0.423, LLCI/ULCI = 0.379/ 0.465). This suggested that the present analysis might be potentially biased toward understating, rather than overstating, the summary effect. Such a potential vulnerability to understating the effect is the opposite to what one would normally expect from a review that is confounded by publicat ion bias (i.e. the under -sampling of non -significant effect sizes which are prevalent among unpublished studies (Balliet & Van Lange, 2013; Cooper, 1998). Nevertheless, the non -significant Egger's regression coefficient (intercept = 0.50, standard error = 1.09, LLCI/ULCI = -1.67/2.67, p = .6473 (two -tailed)) should have dispel led any concern about bias toward underestimation. Taken together , all these indicators suggest that the present analysis is not contaminated by publication bias. See Figure 2 .2 below for the funnel plot.

Chapter 2 75 2.3.2. Moderator Analyses Table 2.3 above shows the results of the univariate moderator analyses . Below I explored every of the theoretical or methodological moderators . 2.3.2.1. Reciprocity versus Non-Reciprocity I coded if the prosociality measures reported were reciprocity or non- reciprocity driven. The results indicated a statistically significant difference, Q (1) = 10.135, p = .0015 , with studies which assessed outcomes ( r = 0.397, LLCI/ULCI= 0.346/ 0.446, k = 76) resulting in a stronger link between prosociality and gratitude than did studies which focused on non- reciprocal prosocial outcomes ( r 2.3.2.2. Reciprocity Nature: Direc t versus Indirect Reciprocity Outcomes were coded as either direct or indirect reciprocity. The results showed that while in both cases the associations were significant, studies that examined direct reciprocity ( r = 0.435, LLCI/ULCI = 0.378/ 0.489, k = 53) had a stronger association between gratitude and prosociality , than studies that examined indirect reciprocity ( r = 0.282, LLCI/ULCI= 0.170/ 0.386, k = 16), Q (1) = 6.463, p = .0110. This indicates that gratitude is a stronger predictor of prosocia lity in the context of direct rather than indirect reciprocity .Furthermore, it was worth noting that there are similar effect sizes, Q (1) = 0.259, p = .611, for studies that assessed non-reciprocal r = 0.247, LLCI/ULCI = 0.165 / 0.325, k = 16) and those which examined indirect reciprocity ( r = 0.282). Studies which measured direct reciprocity ( r = 0.435), meanwhile, reported a significantly larger effect, Q (1) = 14.77, p <.001, than studies whose outcomes were non-reciprocal . This might suggest the moderating effect of Chapter 2 76 reciprocity versus non -reciprocity on the gratitude -prosociality association may be attributable to the direct instead of the indirect reciprocal exchanges . 2.3.2.3. Upstream versus Downstream Indirect Reciproci ty While the associations with both upstream (r = 0.147, LLCI/ULCI = 0.043/ 0.247, k = 9) and downstream (r = 0.484, LLCI/ULCI = 0.253/ 0.662, k = 5) indirect reciprocity were significant, the association was significantly stronger for downstream indirect reciprocity, Q (1) = 6.655, p = .0099. 2.3.2.4. Social Relationships I coded whether gratitude was generated by a benefit -triggered relationship or generalized gratitude. The results revealed a significant difference, Q (1) = 14.807, p = .0001. While both associations were significant, the benefit -triggered gratitude ( r = 0.415, LLCI/ULCI = 0.362/ 0.466, k = 69) resulted in a significantly larger association than generalized gratitude (r = 0.240, LLCI/ULCI = 0.165/ 0.312, k = 19). 2.3.2.5. Continent of Participation, Religiosity and Collectivism I coded the continents in which the studies were administered and examined if this moderated the link between gratitude and prosociality . The majority of the studies reported a moderate positiv e relation between gratitude and prosociality with studies from Western Europe (r = .425, LLCI/ ULCI = 0.298/0.536, k = 13) having the largest effect size, then East Asia (r = 0.399, LLCI/ ULCI = 0.318/0.474, k = 23) followed by North America (r = 0.350, LLCI/ ULCI = 0.289/0.408, k = 55). However, there was no significant moderating effect of continent, Q (2) = 1.685, p = .4307. Regression analyses showed that effect -size estimates did not vary as a function of religiosity (= - 0.0012, p = .416) or collectivism (= -0.0008, p = .408) within each country . Chapter 2 77 2.3.2 .6. Gratitude Measure: State versus Disposition I coded whether the type of gratitude examined in the studies was referred to as a state/mood or as a disposition . The data revealed that the type of gratitude measures did result in different effect sizes, Q (1) = 10.253, p = .001, with the gratitude -prosociality association stronger for the studies which reported state/mood gratitude measures ( r = 0.393, LLCI/ULCI = 0.343/ 0.441, k = 77) than studies that examined dispositional gratitude ( r = 0.248, LLCI/ULCI = 0.171/ 0.322, k = 24) . 2.3.2 .7. Type of Study and Gratitude Induction I examined whether studies that were classified as Laboratory Studies or Survey/Field studies had different gratitude -prosociality effect sizes. As displayed in Table 2.3, gratitude was significantly associated with prosociality whether it was lab-based (r = .367, LLCI/ULCI = 0.312/ 0.419, k = 59) or a survey/field study based ( r = .385, L LCI/ULCI = 0.308/ 0.456, k = 32) . However, whether the study was lab-based or a Survey/Field studies did not moderate the effect estimates , Q (1) = 0.145 , p = .7037 . I then examined whether the way through which gratitude was induced within the 59 lab-based studies moderated the relationship between gratitude and prosociality . It was anticipated that studies that were experimental/economic game based would yield a stronger effect -size than vignettes . The results, demonstrated that that gratitude -prosoci ality association was significant for both vignettes ( r = .403, LLCI/ ULCI = 0.316/ 0.484, k = 25) and r = .335, LLCI/ ULCI = 0.267/ 0.399, k = 34), but the two did not differ significantly , Q (1) = 1.528, p = .2164 . 2.3.2.8. Objective versus Subjective Prosociality Chapter 2 78 I coded if the prosociality measure adopted was objective (r = 0.318, LLCI/ULCI = 0.254/ 0.380, k = 30) = 0.393, LLCI/ULCI = 0.337/ 0.446 , k = 62). While both effects are significant the results rev ealed no significant moderating effect, Q (1) = 3.101, p = .0782. 2.3.2.9. Target of Prosociality: Individual versus Group I coded if the prosocial behaviours or behavioural tendencies reported were individually - or group -targeted . The associations between gratitude and prosociality were significant for group -directed prosociality ( r = 0 .431, LLCI/ ULCI = = 34), and prosociality ( r = 0.355, LLCI/ ULCI = 0.309/0.398, k = 44) . However, th ese associations were not significantly different from each other, Q (1) = 2.756, p = .0969. 2.3.2.10. Proxy versus Actual Gratitude Measure I coded whether proxy or actual gratitude measures were used. While associations were significant for both proxy ( r = 0.418, LLCI/ULCI = 0.312/ 0.413, k = 14) and ( r = 0.371, LLCI/ULCI = 0.323/ 0.417, k = 82), these were not different from each other, Q (1) = 0.416, p = .4161 . 2.3.2.11. Times Cited , Years of Publications , and Age I considered whether a study was frequently cited would have a bearing on its reported effect size . The results demonstrated an absence of significant moderating effect by times cited ( = -0.0002 , p = .63).

There was no effect of year of publication or the year in which the studies we re conducted ( = -0.0038 , p = .50). There was no effect of age either (= Chapter 2 79 0.0034 , p = .17) In short , these results showed that the effect estimates was not affected by how frequently cited the studies were, whether the studies were published, when the studies were conducted, and how old the participants were . 2.3.3.

The Random -Effect Trim -and-Fill analysis indicated zero imputed studies in the current sample , resulting in no change i n the effect estimate. There were 24 studies with 103 effect sizes with a total N of 7,677 . The overall effect size was positive and significant ( r = 0.288, p <.001). Thus, while dispositional gratitude and other prosocial dispositions are associated this effect is small , and that dispositional gratitude cannot be considered as synonymous with a general prosocial disposition . 2.3.4. Gratitude , Other Prosocial Emotions and Differential Predictive Power Tables 2.5 and 2.6 detail the individual and overall effect estimates for the pride -prosociality and anger -prosociality links respectively . For pride there were twenty -three ( k = 23) studies with a total N of 4,509 and 96 effect sizes. The effect was positive and significant ( r = .212, p <.001) but smaller than that of the gratitude -prosociality link. There was also no evidence of publication bias with a non -significant ( p -and-Fill analysis filled in three studies with imputed effects larger than the mean effect estimates, resulting in a slightly higher post-adjusted effect estimates ( r = 0.250, LLCI/ ULCI: LLCI/ ULC I: 0.114/0.306) .Chapter 2 79 Table 2.4.

Nonetheless, the Random -effect Trim -and- Fill analysis filled in four studies with effect sizes smaller than the initial estimates, resulting i n a non-significant post-adjusted effect estimate ( r = 0.083, -0.0282/0.192, Q = 1028.11). However, as anger is related to two very distinct notions of prosociality (i.e. cooperation and norm enforcement) I included this as a moderator. This segregation was based upon whether punishment was involved (i.e., Second - and Third -party punishment ) with studies examining 'Third -party Compensations ' (e.g. Study 2, Gummerum, Van Dillen, Van Dijk, & Lopez -Perez, 2016) coded as 'no -punishment'. The difference between studies that involved a punishment (k = 18, r = 0.370, 0.312/0.425) and those that did not ( k = 27, r = 0.022, -0.121/0.157) was significant, Q (1) = 22.525, p <.001. Taken together, anger appears linked primarily to norm -enforcing punishment rather than direct cooperation . Table 2.7 below highlights the comparison of the effect sizes derived from the analyses in this paper and meta -analyses reported by others. Overall gratitude has one of the largest effect sizes, with P ositive Affect the largest. To directly test if the gratitude -prosociality link is stronger than either the Positive Affect- prosociality or Negative Affect -prosociality links I identified 69 studies (with 195 effect sizes) within the database that contain estimat es of the associations between other prosocial emotions ( happiness , pride , anger, guilt, shame ) and prosociality that I could compare directly to estimates of the gratitude -prosociality association . The results are displayed in Table 2.8. I Chapter 2 84 combined all ot her prosocial emotions to differentiate Positive Affect (e.g. happiness, pride, elevation, interpersonal liking etc.) and Negative Affect (e.g. anger, guilt, sadness, shame combined). Gratitude had a significantly stronger association with prosociality than either Positive Affect , Q (1) = 3.928, p = .0475 (two -tailed) or Negative Affect , Q (1) = 49.77, p <.001 (two -tailed) .

Sensitivity Analysis I explored the effect of whether the index of association was derived from a univariate , zero-order association ( r = 0.388, LLCI/ULCI = 0.340/ 0.435, k = 74), or ones that were derived from higher order partials ( r = 0.303, LLCI/ULCI = 0.200/0.399, k = 18). While both effects were significant, they did not significantly differ from each other, Q (1) = 2.4 1, p =.121 (Table 2.3). 2.4. Discussion 2.4.1. Summary of Evidence Despite three decades of research on the link between gratitude and prosociality , there has been an absence of a quantitative synthesis of this link and a systematic exploration of moderators . In this meta -analytic review a Chapter 2 87 positive mod erate association was shown between gratitude and prosociality (r = 0.374) . The results further indicated that the gratitude -prosociality link was significantly stronger for (1) prosociality that involved a direct reciprocal rather than an indirect reciprocal exchange , (2), downstream versus upstream indirect reciprocity, (3) state/mood rather than dispositional gratitude was assessed, and (4) benefit -triggered gratitude in response to others ' kindness rather than generalized gratitude about valued a nd cherished aspects of one's life. In the following I discuss the theoretical significance of the current findings and how some of these attributes could be incorporated into existing gratitude intervention (or training) regimens . Before exploring these findings in more detail it is necessary to acknowledge the limitations of the present analyses. This should give the reader a cleaner framework to interpret the findings . I applied the Mixed -effects model in both the categorical moderator analyses and the meta -regression for the continuous moderators. As discussed previously the mixed -effects model is notorious for its over -conservativeness (Balliet & Van Lange, 2013; Lipsy & Wilson, 2001). Nevertheless, it is appropriate to adopt a Mixed -effects model because it assumes the existence of systematic variations in the effect sizes (i.e. moderators) alongside the random population variance (Voss, Kramer, Basak, Prakash, & Roberts, 2010 ), despite the potential for Type -II errors. It should be noted that the studies reviewed were a mixture of experimental manipulations of gratitude or cross -sectional assessment s. Thus, while it may not feasible to make any clear definitive statement regarding causality , I believe that the experimental work \u2014that exogenously man ipulates gratitude \u2014provides some evidence that gratitude has a causal role with respect Chapter 2 88 to influencing prosocial behaviour . For causal statements where randomization has not been used causality can be inferred using propensity score matching (See Jackson, Thoemmes, Jonkmann, Ludtke, & Trautwein, 2012 ) or finding an instrumental variable (Shepherd, O'Carroll , & Ferguson, 2014 ), as long as the sample sizes are sufficiently large. Similar to what has been addressed in Balliet, Li, Macfarlan , and Van Vugt (2011), another potential limitation of the current analysis could be attributable to the sampling of the studies and the search strategies . Although there were 16 countries represented in the sample ( k = 91), the majority of the studies were from North America or Western Europe ( k = 68). This could be due to the fact that I had confined the search to papers written in English only. In other words, although I analysed the effect of nationalities (or cont inent) and failed to observe any significant impact on the effect estimates, the current analysis may not generali se beyond Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) societies (Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan, 2010). With these limitation s in mind , I now address the main theoretical (See Sub -section 2.4.2) and practical (See Sub -section 2.4.3) implications of the findings. 2.4.2. Theoretical Implications The overall effect estimates arising from the present meta -analysis identified a positive medium -sized effect between gratitude and prosociality (Cohen, 1988). This confirms the general expectation in the literature that gratitude has the capacity to engen der prosocial exchanges (McCullough et al., 2001; McCullough et al., 2008; McCullough & Tsang, 2004). This effect emerges as significant regardless of (1) whether it was a lab based manipulation or survey/field study based, (2) whether it was based on an Chapter 2 89 objective or subjective estimate of prosociality , (3) whether it was targeted at individuals or groups, (4) the continent in which the research occurred , and (5) whether gratitude was assessed via a proxy or an actual gratitude measure, thus the gratitude -prosociality association is robust to a number of methodological moderators. This implies, for example, that subjective measures could be used, at least in early stages of research, to gauge effect sizes and test protocols . Importantly, however, this association was significantly moderated by a number of key theoretical constructs. There were stronger associations between gratitude and prosociality in studies that examined reciprocity -based prosocial exchanges, compared to pr osociality that did not involve reciprocity. This is consistent with the moral motivator function of gratitude (McCullough et al., 2002; McCullough et al., 2001) where gratitude may typify a reciprocal instead of a benevolent emotion (Yagil, 2015) such as sympathy (Wisp\u00e9, 1986 ) or empathy (Scott, Colquitt, Paddock, & Judge, 2010 ). This is also consistent with the theory that gratitude underlies reciprocity (direct , indirect upstream and indirect downstream ) (Nowak & Roch, 2007). In addition, I observed a significantly stronger association between gratitude and reciprocity for direct versus indirect reciprocal exchanges. That is, while the present data reiterates that gratitude -inspired reciprocity could take on either a direct or an indirect (both upstream a nd downstream) form of reciprocity (Nowak & Roch, 2007; Schaumberg & Flynn, 2009), gratitude may be more concerned with direct reciprocal altruism (McCullough et al., 2008; Trivers, 1971). This may reflect the clearer and stronger social exchange that takes place in direct reciprocation where gratitude may also trigger a sense of obligation and indebtedness (Wood Chapter 2 90 et al., 2016), both of which encourage a greater tendency to repay the initial favour ( see Schaumberg & Flynn, 2009 for a review ). I also find that the association is stronger for downstream compared to upstream indirect reciprocity . This is of particular theoretical significance as some authors (e.g., Nowak & Roch, 2007) have tied gratitude specifically to upstream indirect reciprocity . The small ks, however, in this specific comparison warrant caution in interpreting this finding. However, it should be noted that in all form of reciprocal exchanges the association is significant . The gratitude -prosociality link was stronger when gratitude was triggered in response to others' kindness (i.e. benefit -triggered ) rather than as a generalized sense of gratitude (Lambert et al., 2009). I argue that this not only reflects a sense of reciprocity but also helps to build strong social ties. That is, returning favours to those we are close to emotionally or physically tends to strengthen the existing social bonds and create new ones which promote the survival of altruism (Preston, 2013). These bonds hold people together under times of need and hence epitomise how gratitude might facilitate well-being (Emmons & Mishra, 201 1). This suggests, with respect to reciprocal exchange s, that gratitude may have a particularly important role to play w ith respect to the evolution and maintenance of prosocial behaviour . However, with respect to the role of gratitude , it is important to distinguish exchanges that focus on family (kin) from those that focus on non - kin (McCullough et al. , 2008; Nowak, 2006 ). It has been argued that for exchanges that involve family and relatives, where kin selection models apply, gratitude is less important than for exchanges that involve strangers (McCullough et al. , 2008 ). Kin selection models link prosocial exchange to the Chapter 2 91 degree of genetic relatedness between individuals. With people showing differential preferable helping towards those to whom they are genetically closer than those who are not (see Nowak, 2006 for review) . It is argued that in such kin -based exchanges the prosociality is primarily about maintaining your shared genes in the population. As such, gratitude is not needed to motivate prosociality in such context. The current data does not allow for this to be tested but it is an interesting and important hypothesis concerning the limits of the gratitude -prosociality association. The present results suggested that both dispositional and state forms of gratitude motivate prosociality, although dispositional gratit ude is a weaker motivator than state gratitude . The importance of both dispositional and state gratitude in facilitating prosociality has been extensively discussed in various models in the Social Psychology literature (e.g. Kubacka, Finkenauer, Rusbult, & Keijsers, 2011; McCullough et al., 2001; Wood et al., 2008). The current study does not allow me to test if indeed state gratitude mediates the dispositional gratitude -prosociality link. However, the finding which indicates that dispositional gratitude ha s a weaker link to prosociality than state gratitude does bare the signature of models whereby emotions mediate dispositional effects (Fredrickson et al., 2003). This is indeed the main mechanism of the Social Cognitive Model of Gratitude (SCMG) (Wood et al., 2008). While the meta -regression indicated that the distinction between state and disposition is the one of primary importance, this does not mean that the reciprocity and benefit -triggered associations are irrelevan t. Rather, I envisaged a state manifestation of gratitude that forms a complex around reciprocity and benefit -triggered/ generalized gratitude to motivate prosocial exchanges . Chapter 2 92 Additionally, it is worth noting that anger has a unique role with respect to punishing non -cooperators to enhance cooperation, rather than fostering cooperation directly . This is an important observation as this association between anger and altruistic punishment has long been hypothesi sed, but this is first real systematic demonstration that there is a robust effect . Finally, dispositional gratitude was significantly and positively associated with other prosocial dispositions (e.g., agreeableness), that are also known to be associated with prosocial behaviour (see Zhao & Smillie, 2015). Whether or not this link to other prosocial dispositions accounts for the current link between disposition gratitude and prosociality remains to be investigated, but these results clearly suggest that this is a possibility . 2.4.3. Practical Significance: Implications on Gratitude Intervention Compared to the other prosocial emotions examined in this review, gratitude had the largest effect size and was a significantly stronger predictor of prosociality than either Positive Affect or Negative Affect . This suggests that gratitude constitutes a decent target for interventions to enhance prosociality . Thus, the main practical application of the findings from this review entails implications for extending and developing intervention around gratitude that may enhance prosocia l behaviour and subjective well -being (see Davis et al., 2016; Renshaw & Olinger -Steeeves, 2016; Wood et al., 2010 ). The classic gratitude intervention was originated in studies by Emmons and McCullough (2003) and Froh, Sefick and Emmons (2008) who instru cted participants to recall up to five gratitude -inducing events that took place in their recent past . Although this gratitude induction may have focused on transitory feelings of gratitude, it may not have captured some other factors that influence Chapter 2 93 the li nk between gratitude and prosociality. Indeed, the moderator analysis indicated that the gratitude -prosociality link was stronger when gratitude was examined as a state/mood ; and when gratitude was triggered by an 'interpersonal transfer of a benefit (pp. 1194)' (Lambert et al., 2009). Moreover, both direct reciprocal exchange and downstream indirect reciprocity had the largest effect sizes. Thus exchanges that emphasi se mutual benefit or attracting help from others \u2014thanks to previous good deeds \u2014appear to be crucial. Thus , I propose that future gratitude interventions designed to promote prosociality should include the element of benefit -triggered gratitude and reciprocity. For instance, resembling Watkins and colleagues' (2003) 'Grateful Essay' training, practitioners could instru ct the trainees to write about a particular person, for example a close friend, for whom they feel grateful and how they either actually helped, or intended to help, that particular individual back ( direct reciprocity). Participants could also be instructe d to consider how their good deeds may influence others to help them when they need help (downstream indirect reciprocity) or how feelings of gratitude may influence them to help others ( upstream indirect reciprocity). I acknowledge that some people may spontaneously generate situations of this type in a free response list, but not all will. At a group level this may serve to weaken the effectiveness of any interventions. Even though the changes as suggested at present are small, it is well -known that small changes in frames can significantly alter behavioural and emotional responses (Dolan & Kahneman, 2008). So while the suggested change at present may be small, it still constitutes an empirical question of whether this small change could result in a large impact on the enhancement of effectiveness of gratitude interventions .Chapter 3 94 Chapter 3 Gratefully received, gratefully repaid: the role of perceived fairness in cooperative interactions (Experiment 1) A version o f the present chapter is published as: Ma, L.K., Tunney, R.J., & Ferguson, E. (2014). Gratefully Received, Gratefully Repaid: The Role of Perceived Fairness in Cooperative Interactions. ONE , 9(12), e114976. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0114976. (Media Co 3.0. Overview of Chapter 3 Chapter 2 \u2014which presents the meta -analysis \u2014illustrated that the gratitude -prosociality relation is more prominent among studies which examined direct reciprocal outcomes. The meta -analysis also revealed that studies which examined gratitude as a state generally reported a larger gratitude -prosociality correlation. Building upon these findings, I intend to examine gratitude, as a state symboli sing appreciation (McCullough et al., 2002), in the context of a direct reciprocal economic exchange. Additional ly, this chapter would underline the role of normative fairness perception (Elster, 2006) in the gratitude -reciprocity link. That is, how the expectations of what an average fair person should do (Bicchieri & Chavez, 2010) \u2014in an economic exchange \u2014would aff ect how gratitude relates to one's decision to reciprocate. It is well documented that people are inclined to reward fair behaviour s by being cooperative, i.e. positive reciprocity (Fehr & Falk, 1999) while penali sing unfair behaviours via sanctioning , i.e. negative reciprocity (Fehr & Falk, 1999). Fair intentions are expected to elicit positive emotions (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983), like gratitude (Komter, 2004; Nadler, 2012), triggering cooperative behaviours or behavioural 2 004a; McCullough et al., 2001; Tsang, 2007); while intended unfairness is conducive to negative affect , like anger or indebtedness (Hatfield & Sprecher, 1983), fostering sanctioning decisions (Ma et al., 2012; Yamagishi et al., 2009 ). Nevertheless , Bicchie ri (2006) theorise d that when people infer the intention of others they do it on the basis of a 'background of expectations (pp.112)' . These expectations , amongst other things, constitute the injunctive norm about what an average person ought to do in a given context ( Burger et Chapter 3 96 al., 2010; Cialdini et al., 1990 ; Kallgren, Reno , & Cialdini, 2000). Thus, the injunctive norm could be instrumental when one evaluates whether he/she was fairly treated, with this attribution already well -documented to sh ape gratitude and reciprocity (Kim & Lee, 2013; Komter, 2004; McCullough et al., 2001). As such , in Experiment 1 I created an e conomic game setting in which people were bound to make reference to the injunctive norm to determine whether or not they were fairly treated . In so doing I examined how th is normative fairness attribution would foster a favourable (or negative ) interpretation of the helper 's intent, and consequently contributed to a greater feeling of gratitude (indebtedness ) by the recipient. That is , the current experiment scrutini sed how this chain of attributions would influence the recipients' desire to reciprocate as well their actual reciprocal behaviours, especially when not cooperating yields no repercussions . Importantly, this experime ntal design enables me to examine whether people would really rely on normative fairness to guide their decision making; and if yes, how such a fairness perception will contribute to the gratitude -reciprocity association. A hundred and twenty -two student s were recruited to play a one -shot, variant of trust game in which half played as potential helpers ( i.e. P1s hereafter , N = 61) and half as recipients ( i.e. P2s hereafter , N = 61). Whether a participant was a P1 or P2 was chance -determined and all partic ipants knew that. P1s had to decide whether to help P2s and whether to make their offer unconditional (no repayment needed) or conditional (full or 'taxed' repayment). P2s decided whether to accept a) the offer and b) whatever conditions attached but were blind to the list of helping options available to the P1s. Chapter 3 97 I examined if a normatively unfair offer, i.e. to impose a charge for helping knowing that one did not legitimately 'earn' thus entitle him/herself to that position as the helpe r (Hoffman & Spitzer, 1985), would prompt a less favourable helper intent attribution, thus lead to lower gratitude (or higher indebtedness ) and ultimately a lower desire to reciprocate. Furthermore, these recipients were provided an avenue to sanction the helpers by under -repaying . P2s in this game were free to decide whether to really pay up after supposedly 'agreeing' to the contract . I further examined whether gratitude and indebtedness will be related to this sanctioning decision . All in all , via Expe riment 1 I empirically addressed the importance of fairness and intent attribution on the gratitude -reciprocity association. In so doing I endeavour to build on the meta -analysis (i.e. Chapter 2) \u2014i.e. gratitude overall correlates stronger with prosociality that involves direct reciprocity (e.g. Graham, 1988; Goei & Boster, 2005; Goei et al., 2007) \u2014by outlining what other mediat ing factor (s) (i.e. injunctive fairness) could contribute to the strength of this particular link. In addition, the present experiment also investigated whether the above chain of attributions will constitute a similar effect on a recipient's indebtedness , and subsequently affected the participants' reported tendency so as their actua l reciprocal (or sanctioning) behaviours. 3.1. Introduction Chapter 2 illustrated the consistent relationship between gratitude and reciprocity, in particular direct reciprocity , across studies. Indeed, t he reciprocity principle stipulates that 'we should attempt to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us (pp.20) (Cialdini, 2001). Fehr & G\u00e4chter, 1998, 2000) further Chapter 3 98 make a distinction between the tendency to remunerate (or show cooperation ) fair behaviours ( positive reciprocity), and the tendency to sanction (or be hostile towards) acts we perceive as unkind or unfair (negative reciprocity). Addit ionally, while positive reciprocity is mediated by the perceived trustfulness of a giver (Fehr & List, 2004; Fehr & Rockenbach, 2003), negative affect \u2014such as the transgressors ( Drouvelis & Grosskopf, Seip et al., Houser, 2005) \u2014mediates negative reciprocal acts. 3.1.1. Intention, Gratitude and Indebtedness The above implies that when a person decides whether to sanction or reward a n interactional partner the attribution of the partners' intentions is crucial (Charness & Levine, 2007; Falk, Fehr , & Fischbacher, 2008). In fact , Falk and Fischbacher (2006) theorise d that reciprocation (or retaliation) is dependent upon the recipient's evaluation of the helper 's intention. Hence, reciprocity should be more than a knee -jerk reaction to a benefit received, as the recipient also ponders why he/she was offered what they were. Greenberg and Westcott (1983) argued that a prosocial gesture which communicates good intention should elicit positive affect such as gratitude in the recipient directed toward the helpers (Tsang, 2006 b), and these positive emotions can motivate reciprocation (Bartlett & Desteno, 2006; Schaumberg & Flynn, 2009; Tsang, 2007). Indeed, Nowak and Roch (2007) had particularly highlighted the importanc e of gratitude in both triggering and sustaining the direct and indirect reciprocation mechanisms . Fredrickson (2004 a) similarly theorise d that gratitude drives people to 'behave prosocially oneself, either towards the benefactor, toward others, or both (pp.150).' This definitely echoes Chapter 3 99 the moderate, positive correlation ( r = 0.454, p <.001) between gratitude and direct reciprocal measures as reported in Chapter 2 across over ninety studies. The corollary of the above is that unfair acts that are perceived to reflect malicious intentions should elicit negative emotions such as indebtedness (Greenberg & Shapiro, 1971). Indebtedness represents an aversive state of tension (Greenberg & Frisch, 1972) that is associated with negative action tendencies such as inhibition and avoidance (Watkins et al., 2006). Meanwhile, the effect of indebtedness on reciprocity remains inconclusive. While it is well documented that an ind ebted person would reciprocate to rid oneself of the unpleasant feeling ( Gergen et al., 1975 ; Schaumberg & Flynn, 2009), Greenberg and Westcott (1983) contended that apart from reciprocation cognitive restructuring also constitutes a 'major mode of indebte dness reduction (pp.95)'. These restructuring efforts entail a reassessment of the benefit received which often leads to the recipients discrediting the benefactors and ultimately, feeling less obliged to give back (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983). 3.1.2. Inj unctive norm, Objectives of Experiment 1 and the Hypotheses The above summari sed the literature on how intent attribution is crucial to people's emotions and subsequent reward or sanctioning decisions. Meanwhile, it is argued that when people attend to others' intentions they do so not out thin air , as Bicchieri (2006) stated that 'an intention is only good or bad against a background of expectations (pp.112)'. These expectations by definition constitute, amongst other things, the 'inju nctive norm' which delineates how an average person should behave in a given situation ( Kallgren et al., 2000; Perkins, 2002; Raihani & McAuliffe, 2014). That is , Bicchieri (2006) suggested that when evaluating someone else's intent, e.g. being fair or Chapter 3 100 otherwise, people will base their judgment on whether that 'someone' had acted in accord with what the society expects from an average fair person . Indeed, the idea that injunctive norms underpin fairness judgment has been endorsed by models in the social psychology and social cooperation literature ( See Fahr & Irlenbusch, 2000; Irwin & Simpson, 2013). Nevertheless, to date it still remains unaddressed how such a norm -based fairness judgment will incite people's emotions of gratitude , or indebtedness , and how that may ultimately contribute to an individual's decisions to reciprocate or sanction in an economic exchange. In Experiment 1 I examined this idea using a one -shot, variant of the trust game ( i.e. TG) (Berg, Dickhaut , & McCabe, 1995 ; Camerer, 2003 ). Particularly, in this game 1) all players were anonymous to each other and the experimenter (thereby eliminating any motive to build reputations ); 2) players interacted in pairs with one being a potential helper ( i.e. P1) and the other playing a pot ential recipient ( i.e. P2); 3) who ended up as either P1 or P2 in every pair, was by pure chance thus removing any ability attributions ; and finally, P2s were completely unaware of the options P1s had available to them. Such unawareness is essential as Ch arness and Levine (2007) argued that when making an economic decision an agent (i.e. a recipient) would infer a principal's (i.e. a helper) intention also on the basis of the latter's range of possible behavioural options \u2014that is, the option that was picke d and those could have been picked. Therefore, by keeping P2s na\u00efve to the options available to the helpers , coupled with the double -anonymous (Hoffman et al., 1994) setting, P2s could only rely on their beliefs about what people should do in this context (i.e. injunctive norm ) as the basis for evaluating how fair (or unfair ) their P1 partners were with respect to the any help offer they made. Chapter 3 101 P1s, meanwhile, could offer 'unconditional ' help (i.e. asking for no repayment and P2s could not repay) or 'condi tional ' help (full repayment o r repayment with an interest charge ). I examined whether th is difference in the types of helping offered \u2014unconditional versus conditional \u2014would suffice to induce different attributions of fairness in recipients towards the hel per. The null hypothesis , by contrast, would state that in the absence of information about the options open to the helpers, all help \u2014conditional or otherwise \u2014should be perceived as equally fair. Alternatively, it is plausible to hypothesi se that individu als resort to injunctive norms of fairness (i.e. how people ought to behave). That is, when somebody's good fortune is acquired by chance (or assignment) , rather than that owner having to earn the 'Property 2006; Hoffman & Spitzer, 1985 ; Hoffman et al., 1994 ) to that good fortune , then in general a 'fair' individual should share that extra resources with other people equally (Frey & Bohnet, 1995). In this case, a typical fair, fortunate P1 should help his/her P2 partner and help unconditionally \u2014i.e. 'for free' . This hypothesis has garnered support in the social psychology, social cooperation and behavioural economics literature (See Bicchier i, 1999; Hoffman et al. , 1996; Ruffle, 1998). As such, I predicted a difference in attributions of helpers' intentions, even in the absence of any knowledge about the choices facing the helper , purely based on whether or not th at offer is unconditional. That is, P2 s will rely on the normative belief that fair people will help for free when it is easy to administer and when the helpers' potency to help was 'assigned' (via chance) instead of 'earned'. In summary, Chapter 3 102 Hypothesis 1: Conditionality of offers \u2014which denotes difference in normative fairness of the arrangement \u2014should induce different emotional response from the P2s , e.g. the perception of genuine helpfulness, gratitude and so on ; In addition to hypothesi sing that an unconditional offer would incite a more favourable appraisal of the helper 's intentions, I expected that this should then engender a greater (lower) level of gratitude (indebtedness) (Tsang, 2006a ; Watkins, et al., 2006 ). I further argued that this gratitude would ultimately translate to an elevate d desire for recipients to reciprocate in the future (Tsang, 2006b; Schopler, 1970). A conditional offer, on the contrary , should not only elicit a more cynical appraisal of P1s' intent but also a lower desire to reciprocate (Tsang, 2006a), with this related to sanctioning (e.g. not fulfilling the repayment obligation ) should opportunity beckons (Fehr & Falk, 2002). In a nutshell, I tested a serial multiple mediational model (Hayes, 2013) which examines if the effect of offer conditionality on reciprocity tendency is mediated serially by two psychological processes: 1) initial attributions that the helper genuinely intends to be helpful and 2) feelings of gratitude . Figure 3.1 graphically depicts this hypothesi sed serial mediational model (i.e. H2). Figure 3.1. Graphical Presentation of H2 \u2014the mediational model. On the other hand, as discussed above indebtedness could in theory either strengthen or weaken one's tendency to reciprocate (Greenberg, 1980; Hatfield & Sprecher, 1983 ). Particularly, Greenberg and Westcott (1983) Chapter 3 103 theorise d that a recipient would prefer cognitive restructuring over reciprocation upon i) a perceived absence of opportunity to reciprocate (Schaumberg & Flynn, 2009); ii) a lack of witness to the initial helping episode ; and iii) recipients anticipating no future exchanges with the benefactors. All these conditions were compatible with Experim ent 1 's parameters. As such , it is conceivable that the present indebted recipients may favour cognitive restructuring \u2014which should lead to a decreased desire to reciprocate and a higher propensity to actually under -repay \u2014 in reducing their feeling of indebtedness. As a result , in addition to feeling more indebted upon the receipt of the unfair 'conditional' offers, I predicted a lower likelihood among these indebted recipients to want to and actually reciprocate. H3: P2s who received conditional offers, compared to unconditional offers recipients, should report higher indebtedness , with this indebtedness being negatively related to the intended and actual repayment by these recipients . 3.2. Methods 3.2.1. Participants One hundred and twenty -two students from the University of Nottingham participated (72 were females, mean age: 21.8 years, SD = 3.7 years). Each participant received an inconvenience allowance of \u00a32 and could earn up to \u00a33.50 more. 3.2.2. Game and its Rat ionale The experiment was administered using Z -Tree (Fischbacher, 2007). To begin with each participant was given a fair die to roll and was seated in a separate cubicle. Each session took place with groups of 4 to 10, with players in Chapter 3 104 each session randomly assigned to play in dyads, with one participant being the potential helper (P1) and the other playing a potential recipient (P2). Each player was initially endowed with 150 money -equivalent 'Bonus Points' and was informed that he/she needed at least 50 points more to reach the 'Bonus Threshold' (i.e. 200) to claim the bonus money. The initial endowments were allocated this way to create a situation in which all players were, to begin with, equal in the sense that they were all entitled to zero additional bonuses as their initial bonus points stood at 150. It was made explicit to participants that each bonus point would be worth one penny but only when he/she made the 200 point threshold would he/she be entitled to any bonus. The only way to reach that thr eshold was by rolling a fair, six -sided die once. The possible payoffs were a loss of -50 points, 0 points, and gains of 50, 100, 150, and 200 points depending on the number on the dice. It was, nevertheless, emphasi sed that a larger number on the dice did NOT guarantee a more favourable bonus points. The purpose of this die -rolling arrangement was to convince the participants that what differentiated 'winners' (i.e. hitting the threshold) from the 'losers' (i.e. missing the threshold) was simply better fortune but not ability. Every player then learned that he/she had an in -game 'partner' who was unidentifiable and anonymous , and there was no need to collaborate with or compete against that partner throughout the experiment. Unbeknownst to the participants , all their final bonus scores were pre- determined . Regardless of the actual die -roll, P1s always received a 'Die - rolling' score 200 (thus they ended up with 350 points: their initial 150 + 200) that exceeded the 200 point threshold, while P2s would fall s hort of the threshold. Half the P2s ( N = 30) ended up with a final total of 100 bonus point Chapter 3 105 (that is their initial 150 minus 50 points from the dice roll) and the other P2s (N = 31) ended up with 150 points (that is their initial 150 plus zero from the dic e roll). This difference between the P2s was aimed to manipulate the potential helping costs for the P1s. P2s with 100 points were in the 'High -Cost' helping condition, and would require twice the magnitude of their partners' (or potential helpers') minimu m 'donations' (i.e. 100) compared to the 'Low -Cost' recipients with 150 points (i.e. 50), to reach the 200 point threshold. Each participant then learned about his/her payoff and that of his/her 'partner'. At this point both P1s' and P2s' gave attribution s regarding their partners' Die -rolling scores. Specifically they indicated the extent to which they considered their partners' scores were due to (1) Luck ('To what extent you think that your partner's High (Low) score is attributable to his/her good (bad ) luck), and (2) Ability ('To what extent you think that your partner's High (Low) score is because of his/her capability (incompetence)'). Both items were measured using 7 -point Likert -type scales (1 = 'Not At All' and 7 = 'Completely'). In so doing I exa mined if the participants perceived their partners' (good or bad) outcomes as chance - or ability -based. 3.2.3. Unconditional 'Free' versus Conditional 'Charged' Offers 3.2.3.1. Helper's Decisions. P1s, who were better off financially than P2s, were then inquired if they would help P2s by transferring part of their excess bonus points (i.e. 350 - 200 'Bonus Threshold' = 150 points). Helpers could help either unconditionally (i.e. to donate their poi nts and demand no repayment: repayment free offer), or conditionally by attaching a 'repayment clause' to their transfer. All conditional helpers then selected a designated level of repayment (See Figure 3.2) as the Chapter 3 106 repayment clauses of their offers. All these decisions were made privately and P2s were blind to the list of choices that were available to P1s. Figure 3.2 outlines the flow of a P1's decision . Figure 3.2. The flow of decisions made by a potential helper (P1). 3.2.3.2. Recipient's Decisions. After P1s made the decisions their P2 partners were shown, firstly, whether P1s decided to help; and if so, whether the offers were conditional or unconditional , and if they were conditional what the repayment terms were. P2s who received an offer were th en asked to decide whether to accept it. It was emphasi sed to them that they would always be financially better off receiving any offer of help compared to no offer of help, in spite of the repayment obligation or lack thereof. I then assessed recipients' perception of their helpers' decisions using the following constructs: (1) State Annoyance ( 'I am annoyed by my partner's decision.'), (2) State Gratitude (Average of items 'I am thankful for my partner's decision' and 'I feel grateful for what my partner does for me', Cronbach's = 0.931 ), (3) State Indebtedness ('I feel indebted to my partner'), (4) Obligation ('I feel obliged to repay my partner'), (5) Perceived Genuine Helpfulness ('My partner's transfer is motivated by his/her sincere desire to help me'), (6) Perceived Reasonableness ('My partner's Chapter 3 107 decision is reasonable'), and (7) Reciprocating Tendency ('I am eager to help my partner out if he/she is in need in the near future'). All items were rated on 7-point Likert -type scales (1 = 'Not At All' and 7 = 'Completely'). I checked that the recipients of conditional offers understood that they were always better off economically accepting (rather than declining) the offers, even if they paid back in full . P2s who accepted their conditional offers were then shown a reminder of their expected repayment. Immediately after that P2s decide d whether to repay and how much. Importantly by giving P2s the freedom to decide whether or not to honour the agreement these recipients were 'granted' the option of defaulting in the form of a 'breach of contract' (Shavell, 1980). Figure 3.3 illustrates the flow of decisions a P2 was expected to make. Figure 3.3 . The flow of decisions made by a potential recipient (P2) P2s (who received conditional offers) were initially unaware of this option to default when making their emotional judgements . The procedures were set up as such so to avoid confound ing these P2s' emotional judgements -- which are the primary outcome in this study, and make t hese judgements comparable to the unconditional offer receipts in which there was no room for any repayment . P2s who received unconditional offers were not given a latter option to repay the 'free' gift. This was meant to mirror the real world situation in which a 'free' gift from a stranger with no option to repay \u2014e.g., altruistic organ /blood donation or a graduate school scholarship \u2014would remain as such . Chapter 3 108 Meanwhile, by offering the recipients an opportunity to sanction their helpers for their breach of nor mative fairness (i.e. to only help conditionally) , Experiment 1 provided a behavioural measure of positive (full repayment) and negative reciprocity (zero back -transfer or partial repayment) . Thus the level of under -repayment should constitute an index of how the recipients were irked by P1s' defiance of the injunctive norm. Hence the option to default provides a secondary outcome and one that does not bias the initial emotional judgements . In this game all P2s' decisions (e.g. acceptance, repayment) were f ed back to their P1 partners , thus affecting their final payoffs . Afterwards, all players were shown onscreen their respective compensations. They were then instructed to complete the Marlowe -Crowne Social Desirability Scale (Crowne & Marlowe, 1960). In so doing I intended to address any potential validity issues attributable to Social Desirable Responding (Carver & Scheier, 2008). The experiment ended here and the participants were debriefed and paid . 3.2.4. Ethics Statement Experiment 1 was approved by the ethics committee of the School of Psychology at the University of Nottingham. A ll participants were older than 17 and all provided written , informed consent prior to participation as approved by the ethics committee (Approved 11th Feb 2013; Ref. Code: 267). 3.3. Results 3.3.1. Manipulation Check I intended to inspect, via two pre -offer ratings using 7-point Likert , if the present die-rolling procedure succeeded in leading our participants (both P1s and P2s) to believe that what Chapter 3 109 segregated the 'winners' (i.e. making the 200 point 'threshold') from the 'losers' (i.e. missing that) in the game was chance rather than ability . Table 3.1.

As illustrated 3.1, participants in general ( M: 5.04, SD: 2.21) were convinced that their partners' high or low die -rolling scores were due to chance. The independent samples t -tests evidenced that this high propensity to impute partner's outcomes to chance was not affected by gender, which cost condition and which in-game role the participant was assigned to .

Additionally, a Chi -square test was used to determine whether there was a significant difference between helpers from 'Low -cost' and 'High -cost' condition in their 1) decisions to help, and 2) conditionality (need to repay or not) of offers made should they agreed to help.

Furthermore, Fisher's exact test was conducted to determine if helpers' preferences of repayment modes would differ by testing condition. The results indicated no significant effect of testing condition on ( conditional ) helpers ' choices of repayment modes . 3.3.3.2. Effect of Gender I also examined if participants' gender had significantly influenced 1) recipients' post -offer ratings (i.e. emotional responses to offers) , 2) repayment decisions for those who received a conditional offer, 3) helpers ' transfer decisions, and their 4) other helping -related decisions . Independent -sample T - Tests indicated that gender failed to differentiate any of 1) the recipients' post - offer ratings (except that male P2s rated their partners' decisions as more Chapter 3 113 'reasonable' than their female counterparts), 2) repayment decisions of the recipients of conditional offers and 3) the helpers ' magnitude of transf ers and 'over -donation'.

A Chi-square test was used to determine whether there was a significant difference between female and male helpers in their 1) decisions to help (or not), and 2) conditionality of offers made should they agreed to help .

The SDR tendencies were operationalized as participants' composite scores in the MCSD (Crowne & Marlowe, 1960). As shown in Table 3.8, there was no evidence that 1) SDR tendency was correlated with most of the recipients' ( N = 49) post -offer ratings or that 2) SDR tendency influenced the repayment decisions . Table 3.9 . Effect of SDR on helpers ' helping decisions Help Conditionality Tran RM MCSD p (two-tailed) .468 .409 .043 .313 .054 N 61 49 49 49 24 Note. Help = To Help or Not; Conditionality= Unconditional or Conditional offers Made; Trans = Magnitude of Transfer; RM = Conditional Helpers' Chosen Repayment Modes (i.e. level of conditionality in offers made). SDR was also not correlated with P1s' decision s to help, conditionality of offers made should they helped, preferences for repayment modes, and magnitude of 'over -donation'. The results are presented in Table 3.9. While SDR appeared positively ( r = .290 , p = .043 ) correlated with the helpers ' transfer magnitude , this relationship no longer stood (p >.1) once helper s' 'Expected Transfer' (i.e. minimum required transfers) was controlled for. Chapter 3 115 Taken together, the above analyses failed to demonstrate any associations between MCSD with the current k ey outcome measures, indicating that SDR may not have substantially contaminated the current analysis. 3.3.4. Hypotheses Testing As detailed above the current key outcomes measures were not subjected to contamination of the possible confounds. Therefore, i n the main analysis I collapsed findings from both cost conditions and genders . Below I detail the results of the main hypotheses (i.e. H1 to H3) testing. 3.3.4.1. Testing Hypothesis 1 H1: Conditionality of offers \u2014which denotes difference in normative fair ness of the arrangement \u2014should induce different emotional response from the P2s, e.g. the perception of genuine helpfulness, gratitude and so on; Table 3.10 Statistics for P2s' Post -offer ratings Conditionality of offer received Unconditionala Conditionalb t-statistic df Mean (SD) (SD) MD 1.73 37.9 1.40 (0.71) 1.88 (1.15) 0.475 5.63 Perceived Low Cost of Help 1.88 47 3.76 (1.79) 4.67 (1.58) 0.907 0.482 25. = 24. SED: Standard Error of Differences.* p <.05 ; ** p < .01 (2 -tailed) Independent samples T -Tests were conducted to examine if the conditionality of offer alone elicited differential benefit -triggered emotions and interpretations of helpers' intent. Recipients of unconditional offers (N= 25) reported (1) more gratitude ( p <.05), (2) that the helpers were genuinely more helpful ( p <.05), and (3) a higher tendency to reciprocate ( p <.01). No other post-offer ratings significantly differed by whether the offer received was conditional or unconditional. Table 3.10 above details t he statistics . Chapter 3 116 3.3.4.2. Testing Hypothesis 2 - The serial mediational model (Figure 3.5) Figure 3.5 . A statistical diagram of the hypothesi sed mediator N=49; n.s.= Not hypothesi mediational model \u2014which was depicted in Figure 3.1 \u2014was supported by the current data. This model examines if the effect of offer conditionality on reciprocity tendency is mediated serially by (1) the degree that the helper was perceived as genuinely helpful and (2) the recipients ' level of gratitude. Indeed, the results supported this serial multiple mediator model (Figure 3.5). I adopted the Bootstrap Confidence Intervals (CI) approach when analysing the current model. Hay es (2013) argued that bootstrapping is 'particularly useful relative to normal approach (i.e. the Sobel's (1982) (pp.110) )' as it better handles the non - normality of the sampling distribution (of the indirect effects under scrutiny) which is inherent in sm aller samples, thus rendering 'a test with higher power (pp.106) .') The results are detailed in Table 3.11 and Figure 3.5.

PGH= Perceived Partner Helpfulness; Gs= State Gratitude; Rec= Tendency to reciprocate Chapter 3 117 The present data show that the conditionality of an offer indirectly influenced the recipients' tendency to reciprocate through its effect on attributions of helpfulness and gratitude towards the helper . Recipients receiving an unconditional offer were more prone to see their helper as truly helpful (a 1 = 0.675, p <.05), and therefore reported more gratitude (d 21= 0.412, p <.01). This elevated gratitude predicts a greater desire to reciprocate (b 2 = 0.455, p <.001). A bias -corrected bootstrap CI for this total indirect eff ect (a1d21b2 = 0.675*0.412*0.455 = 0.12 7) based on 5,000 samples excluded zero (0.01 2 to 0.36 8), indicating a significant indirect effect (Field, 20 13). Further analyses indicated that receiving an unconditional offer indirectly influenced gratitude through attributions of helpfulness \u2014i.e. the bootstrap CI for this effect (a 1d21) did not straddle zero (0.02 7 to 0.58 7). However , there was no evidence that receiving an unconditional offer influenced reciprocity te ndency directly (c'= 0.28 6, p = .19), or that receiving an unconditional offer influenced reciprocity indirectly through gratitude only, as the CI for this indirect effect (a 2b2) included zero (-0.144 to 0.63 3). 3.3.4.3. Analyses of Behavioural Data (i.e. Repayment) As revealed in Figure 3.4, twenty -one recipients who had accepted their conditional offers were asked to repay. Of all these 21 recipients eight (i.e. 38.1%) defaulted by either repaying partially or nothing , while the rest ( N =13, 61.9 %) all repaid fully. Interestingly, scrutiny of these eight defaulters response revealed only one instance of zero repayment , while the rest ( N =7) on average repaid 58.4% of their expected repayment. A Wilcoxon Signed -ranked test demonstrated a significant discrepancy, ( Z = 2.53, p = .012), between the Repayment' ( (M: 38.9 ). This suggested that a significa nt level of defaulting occurred among these conditional recipients and that is attributable to those 8 defaulters .

In addition, the Fisher's exact test was conducted to examine whether the level of conditionality of the offers would influence his/her decision to (1) accept (or decline ) the offer, and (2) to cooperate (i.e. to fulfil his/her obligated repayment) or to under -repay (partly or totally). As shown in Table 3.12, neither decisions were significantly influenced (all ps >.05) by the level of conditionality of the offers. This indicated that whether or not recipients of conditional offers were treated 'more hars hly' did not affect their decisions to accept (or reject) and their decisions to cooperate (or default) . 3.3.4.4. Testing Hypothesis 3 H3: P2s who received conditional offers, compared to unconditional offers recipients, should report more indebtedness, wi th this indebtedness being negatively related to the intended and actual repayment by these recipients As illustrated in Table 3.10, recipients of conditional (M: 4.46, SD: 2.19) and unconditional (M: 4.96; SD: 1.72) offers felt similarly (p >.05) indebted to their helpers. Contrary to the above review of the literature , indebtedness was found positively and strongly correlated with positively - valenced emotion items such as gratitude, r (59) = 0.721, p <. 001, and Chapter 3 119 tendency to reciprocate, r (59) = 0.518, p <. 001, while negatively correlated to annoyance, r (59) = -0.423, p<. 001. P2s' indebtedness, meanwhile, was not correlated ( p > .05) to their perception of P1s' genuine helpfulness . Table 3.13.

In addition, there was no evidence that P2s' (N=21) repayment magnitude was correlated (all ps>. 05) with their emotions (e.g. indebtedness, gratitude etc.) the moment they accepted that no rmatively unfair offers . Table 3.13 details the correlational analyses with respect to the magnitude of repayment and emotions of P2s. All in all, the present data did not support H3. 3.4. Discussion 3.4.1. Summary of Results 3.4.1.1. Injunctive Fairness and Gratitude The present data illustrated that conditionality of an offer of help alone, when the recipient is not aware of the options open to the helper, can significantly influence how recipients interpreted the helpers' intentions, so as the recipient s' feelings of gratitude, and their eagerness to reciprocate . In addition, the results show that the greater the perceptions of the helper s' intentions to be helpful (influenced by offer conditionality ) the greater the level of gratitude towards them, and resulting in a greater tendency to reciprocate . Furthermore, the behavioural data revealed that when recipients received a conditional offer, nearly 40% of them (8 out of 21) acted uncooperatively despite prior acceptance (of their obligation) , either giv ing less Chapter 3 120 than they agreed or defecting completely . This indicated that people, albeit lacking awareness of the options open to helper s, still made differential judgments based solely on whether they received a conditional or unconditional offer. I interpre t this as an example of the adherence to the injunctive fairness norm. That is, in the absence of information about the helper , recipients could only infer their helper s' intent to be helpful with reference to the normative beliefs about what an average 'f air' person should do when the opportunity to be in a position to help was determined by chance . 3.4.1.2. Gratitude versus Indebtedness Additionally , the present data showed that people's tendency to want to reciprocate when treated fairly and be less cooperative when treated less fairly (in a normative sense ) is, in part, dependent on attributional and emotional processing. People who inferred that the helper s' intentions we re positive \u2014feel gratitude towards \u2014were more inclined to be eager to help them back in the future . Thus intentions and gratitude are two key processes that help explain the link between conditionality of offers and willingness to reciprocate . Nonetheless, the same logic does not apply to indebtedness. While indebtedness was positively related to one's desire to reciprocate \u2014contrary to our prediction that P2s here should favour cognitive restructuring over reciprocation, indebtedness was not correlated with offer conditionality and intent perception. This implied that indebtedness, unlike gratitude, was uninfluenced by normative fairness. An indebted recipient may still strive to reciprocate irrespective of the intent of his/her benefactor, and also whether or not that benefit constituted a fair gesture. This indeed echoes Tsang's (2006a) observation that while perceived benevolence was crucial in cultivating Chapter 3 121 gratitude, recipients experienced similar indebtedness whether their helpers were acting prosocially thanks to a benevolent or an ulterior reason. 3.4.1.3. The Mediational Model -Role of Normative Fairness Perception on the Gratitude -reciprocity link Meanwhile, the present mediational model demonstrates that injunctive normative beliefs about fairness are important with respect to intentions (Bicchieri & Chavez, 2010) and emotional responses associated with coope ration and reciprocation (Komter, 2004; Nadler, 2012). R ecipients in Experiment 1 had no knowledge about who their helpers were, what their helpers had done in the past, would never meet them , and importantly, knew nothing about the array of options facing the helpers . All they knew was that their helpers' good fortune to be in a posit ion to help was by chance. Consistent with the notion that under these circumstances people should act generously and help for free (Elster, 2006) , the results show clearly that when this is not the case the recipients would view these helpers as less genuinely helpful , feel less gratitude and are less likely to want to reciprocate to them. In fact, this reduced willingness to reciprocate resonates with the indirect reciprocation literature which evidences that we prefer to help 'kind' people with a good r eputation (See Milinski, Semmann, & Krambeck, 2007; Semmann, Krambeck, & Milinski, 2005). Here the results indicate that reputation can be inferred from very minimal information, that is, the conditionality of help only (Ksenia , 2008). 3.4.2. Interesting Observation - Phenomenon of 'Cheap -riding' While only a relatively small segment of recipients who received conditional offers a non -negligible percentage (38%) of them still showed Chapter 3 122 uncoop erative behaviour, and interestingly all but one of these defectors chose to be somewhat 'altruistic' by repaying the majority of their obligated repayment . It is, important and theoretically intriguing to examine the psychological or situational factors t hat motivate someone to engage in this kind of 'impure' free 20 00). Such cheap -riding may symboli se dissatisfaction with the helpers , the actual value the recipients place on the offer or perhaps a means to irk the helpers by deliberately underpaying on their agreed repayment . This reduced backtransfer has been documented before in trust games when the recipient knew in advance their trustors could have refrained from making their investment conditional (or punishable) (see Fehr & Rockenbach, 2003). Here the data revealed a similar phenomenon in the absence of this knowledge. Fehr and colleagues (Fehr & Rockenbach, 2004; Fehr & Schmidt , 2006) had interpreted this as evidence for 'strong reciprocity' (Wiessner, 2005). But then one question remains: Why bother to pay back at all, even at a reduced level? The recipients in this game , if they wished to, could have retained all the money (with no repercussion). However, it appears that these recipients deliberately under -repaid as to express their disapproval of their helpers' breach of normative fairness. I am inclined to interpret this as a means of giving these unfair helpers their 'just deserts' & Thielmann, 2006) and signally disapproval designed to deter their helpers from being ungenerous to others in the future (Gromet & Darley, 2009; Okimoto & Wenzel, 2008). How ever, taking everything may enrage the helper s and even worse, set the stage for them Chapter 3 123 to retrospectively rationali se their initial amoral acts (i.e. not being fair) ( Carroll & Meeks, 1999; Hartman & Nelson, 1999). It may also result in repugnance at the recipient that generali ses to others hence dampened their desire to help in the future. Thus not repaying anything may appear inadvisable. On the contrary , partial repayment signals to the helper s that they were not nice for starters - did not observ e the injunctive norm - by indicating via partial repayment what the recipients believed the (conditional) help was really worth . This, therefore, may serve to make the helper feel guilty. These feeling of guilt are likely to render the helpers more cooper ative in the future (See Boster et al. (2016) for a meta -analysis on guilt -compliance link). Thus partial repayment might be a means to enforce normative fairness in a way similar to altruistic punishment (Fowler, 2005). However, at present I could not rul e out any alternative perspectives (e.g. the recipients under -repaying out of sheer selfishness) that could account for the observed partial repayment . 3.5. Implications of Chapter 3 The present chapter addressed a few things. First, it demonstrated the importance of injunctive norm in functioning as a basis on which people evaluate whether they were fairly (or unfairly) treated. And importantly, this evaluation would consequently infl uence people's attribution of the helpers' intent, and therefore influence how much gratitude was felt and ultimately one's desire to reciprocate. Additionally , this path model could complement the meta -analysis (presented in Chapter 2) by highlighting ano ther potential moderator \u2014 i.e. the perception of normat ive fairness \u2014in influencing how gratitude (as an affective state ) relates to one's prosocial intention . Chapter 3 124 Secondly, the current data acknowledged the divergence of indebtedness and gratitude which was w ell-documented in the literature ( Schaumberg & Flynn, 2009; Tsang, 2006b; Watkins et al., 2006 ). Particularly, the present analyses highlighted the lack of association between perceived fairness, or perceived genuine helpfulness, and recipients' indebtedne ss. That is, recipients could still feel indebtedness (and want to reciprocate accordingly) despite the lack of perceived helpful intent or the fact that the arrangement was not injunctively fair. Nonetheless, the present path model (Figure 3.5) indicated that this was clearly not the case for gratitude ; as gratitude was more strongly experienced upon receipt of injunctively fair offers and when helpers were regarded genuinely helpful. This should add to the literature by highlighting the role of indebtedn ess\u2014as a psychological state \u2014in fostering reciprocal economic behaviours, considering that indebtedness is, to my understanding, a basically unexplored domain in the experimental economics literature. Finally, the behavioural data revealed that upon being unfairly treated recipients displayed a non -negligible extent of sanctioning by breaching their agreement. It is, however, still premature to draw many conclusions as only a small fraction of recipients (N = 21, i.e. 34 %) had accepted the conditional offer (thus giving them the very opportunity to under -repay) , not to mention only eight of them had 'cashed in on' this sanctioning option. And although a few speculations have been made on motives behind the observed 'cheap - riding' \u2014e.g. to give 2015) \u2014none were scrutini sed at present. Hence, the primary objective of Experiment 2 \u2014which will be thoroughly discussed in Chapter 4 \u2014was to delve into the situational or Chapter 3 125 psychological factor (s ) that would motivate, and potentially perpetuate, this kind of 'cheap -riding' behaviour (Cornes & Sandler, 1984 ). In particular, via Experiment 2 I intended to examine, and potentially disambiguate the psychological parameters which underlie one's decision to cheap -ride, cooperate, and free -ride on a taxed, or repayment -bound benefit.

Overview of Chapter 4 I observed a non -negligible degree of cheap -riding in Experiment 1 among participants who accepted the injunctively unfair offers. Cheap -riding at present was operationally defin ed as a recipients' partial repayment of an accepted conditional offer. While speculations had been raised on why people would engage in such an economically irrational act (e.g. provisions of 'Just Deserts' (Weinsetein, 2011; Wenzel & Thielmann, 2006)) al l these warranted empirical scrutiny which belongs to the focus of the present chapter. Additionally, the small fractions of recipients i) being 'eligible' to (i.e. 21/ 61= 34%; N = 21), and ii) deciding to (i.e. 8/61= 13.1%; N = 8), under -repay their cond itional offers in Experiment 1further necessitates a relatively less under - sampled and more customized follow -up investigation in Experiment 2. Despite being a sparingly examined research topic the notion cheap - riding has been discussed (or even examined) in different domains. Those included, but not confined to, the i) Public Goods Game (e.g. Asch et al., 1993; Bchir & Willinger, 2013; Isaac, Schmidtz, & Walker, 1989), ii) Marketing (e.g. Krishnamurthy, 2000; Roma & P errone, 2010; Scherer, 1993), and even the iii) International Relations (e.g. Borcherding, 1981; Kennedy, 2015; Lu, 2016; Oneal, 1990) literature. As cheap -riding \u2014which is conceptualised as a potential contributor's endeavour to piggyback on the high contributions of others (e.g. ones' teammates) (Stigler, 1974; Thompson, 1987) \u2014should be far from just an experimental artefact. However, none of the abovementioned empirical works had touched upon the psychology behind cheap -riding. To date there is stil l a gap in the literature on the role of emotions in inciting, and potentially sustaining, cheap -Chapter 4 128 riding . Thus, to fill this gap \u2014which constitutes another crucial objective of the present chapter \u2014I examined the psychological correlates (e.g. state gratitude , indebtedness, or even experienced warm -glow (Ferguson & Flynn, 2016) etc.) of cheap -riding in the present economic exchange context. I administered a one -shot game that specifically scrutini sed i) the 'baseline' response (i.e. to fully repay ('cooperate '), utterly not repay ('free - ride'), or just partially repay ('cheap -ride') to a 'non -free' conditional offer (Ma et al., 2014), and importantly, ii) whether the benefit -triggered state gratitude (Lambert et al., 2009) and indebtedness (Greenberg & Shapiro , 1971; Hatfield & Sprecher, 1983) will be predictive of people's cheap -riding decisions. Via this one -shot, variant of Trust Game I assessed also the motives (which will be discussed later) behind recipients' repayment decisions. In so doing I explored wh ether cheap -riding would, compared to cooperation and free-riding , be originated from a unique pattern of psychological correlates. In the present game each participant played in pairs with an anonymous \u2014in reality fictitious \u2014'partner '. Unlike Exper iment 1, all ( N =135) were pre -programmed to 'lose out' on the dice -rolling and were accordingly entitled to zero bonus. Participants then received an offer from their 'fortunate', victorious partners. All these offers were conditional, as recipients learned that upon acceptance they all undertook an obligation to repay. Acceptors ( N = 87) were then allowed to decide whether to a) pay up in full (i.e. 'cooperating', N = 59), b) to 'cheap -ride' via just giving back partially (N = 17); or c) to e ntirely evade the payment (i.e. 'free -riding', N = 11). In short, Experiment 2 should represent a continuation of Experiment 1 by featuring a more focused and comprehensive investigation into cheap -riding . Chapter 4 129 Additionally, via the psychometrics I examined ho w gratitude (as both a state and a disposition ) and indebtedness (as a state ) would be related to one's trustworthiness or the lack thereof (i.e.to breach a repayment 'contract' via cheap - or free-riding). Furthermore, by examining the motives of repayment I endeavoured to disentangle the psychology of cheap -riders from that of the cooperators and that of the free -riders. 4.1. Introduction 4.1.1. What Cheap -riding constitutes? Experiment 1 showed that participants when subjected to normative unfairness (Elster, 2006) would react by partially breaching a repayment obligation. I termed this deliberate, reduced back -transfer 'cheap -riding' in the present thesis. Indeed, cheap -riding in the wider literature was similarly conceptualised as a contributor's end eavours to just give as little as possible (Asch et al., 1993; Cornes & Sandler, 1984) with the intention to exploit the other contributors' high contributions (Thompson, 1987). Thus, as opposed to a total avoidance of contribution which is commonly unders tood as ' free-riding' (Krishnamurthy, 2000; Olson & Perl, 2005), cheap -riding is characterised by, a) contributing the bare minimum (Schmitz, 1995), and crucially, b) the cheap - riders' cost (i.e. their non -zero inputs) being outweighed by their share of benefits (Kennedy, 2015; Olson & Zeckhauser, 1966). While the cheap -riding has been empirically examined in the Public Goods Games literature (e.g. Bchir & Willinger, 2013; Marks, Lehr, & Brastow, 2006; Isaac et al., 1989), as abovementioned there is also evidence that cheap -riding indeed exists in myriads of interpersonal, societal, or even international contexts. Those include and are certainly not limited to, 1) Chapter 4 130 churchgoers contributing 'relatively little to their congregations (pp.125)' as they take adv antage of 'a few members who contribute far more than their \"fair\" share (pp.125)' (Olson & Perl, 2005); 2) other nations' exploitation (via their respective internal healthcare policy -making) of the American pharmaceutical manufacturers' Research -and-Deve lopment efforts (Scherer, 1993); 3) the alleged inadequate efforts from China in global energy security preservation (Kennedy, 2015); and 4) the United States shouldering an overwhelming burden of military defence against the Soviet Union relative to her fellow NATO member states such as Japan and France (Thompson, 1987). 4.1.2. The Main Objectives of the present Experiment Nonetheless, it remains unaddressed as of what motivates people to cheap -ride (especially when 'free -riding' is a feasible option). Th is phenomenon appears counterintuitive because it deviates from what is normally expected from a rational, profit -maximizing economic agent. As reiterated in Chapter 3, the conditional offer acceptors could have defaulted at 'full throttle' with neither po ssibility of being recogni sed (and accordingly reprimanded), nor incentives to manage reputations (G\u00fcney & Newell, 2013) thanks to the double - anonymous, one -shot game design (e.g. Hoffman et al., 1994). Meanwhile, shirking from an obligation, albeit incomp letely , hardly constitutes the most moral gesture either. Taken together, cheap -riding should make little sense from a rationality standpoint, therefore hinting that psychological factors may instead underlie people's decisions to cheap -ride. As addressed in Section 4.0, despite the existing coverage in the wider literature it remains unexamined in regards the psychological correlates of Chapter 4 131 cheap -riding . Specifically, to date there is still an absence of empirical assessment of the role of emotions in incitin g or restraining cheap -riding. Accordingly, one important objective of Experiment 2 concerns the scrutiny of the psychological correlates of cheap -riding . Importantly, via Experiment 2 I intended to disambiguate the psychology among people who choose to i) stubbornly adhere to a prior commitment despite temptations to default (i.e. cooperating ); ii) make the most out of every possible means in pursuit of s elf- gain (i.e. free -riding); and iii) somewhat cross the 'moral' line by breaching the contract (Shavell, 1980) but refuse to free -ride on others (i.e. cheap -riding ). The present chapter also shed light on an alternative aspect of the gratitude -prosociali ty association. That is, the role of state and dispositional gratitude in restraining sanctioning behaviours (i.e. the Moral Motive Hypothesis of Gratitude (McCullough et al., 2001; McCullough et al., 2008)) in cheap - or free-riding at present. Data of Exp eriment 1 highlighted the role of gratitude in conjunction with intent attributions \u2014both of which were subjected to the injunctive norm (Cialdini et al. 1990; Kallgren et al., 2000) \u2014 in prompting prosocial intention following the receipt of a normatively fair benefit. Experiment 2, in contrast, would examine how gratitude would serve to mitigate cheap - or free -riding as triggered by a normatively unfair benefit. Analyses of Experiment 1 also revealed the well -documented divergent routes via which indebted ness and gratitude were related to increased , direct reciprocal intentions (Schaumberg & Flynn, 2009; Watkins et al., 2006; Tsang, 2006b). Feeling of indebtedness was shown to also correlate with prosocial intentions (i.e. 'willingness to reciprocate'), al though this correlation, unlike gratitude , was independent of whether the offer was fair (See Chapter 3). Chapter 4 132 Meanwhile, Greenberg and colleagues (Greenberg, 1980; Greenberg and Westcott, 1983) had theorise d that indebtedness could instigate a benefit - trigger ed sanctioning response, following a distorted benefit re -appraisal which is intended to manage one's feeling of indebtedness (Hatfield & Sprecher, 1983) (See Chapters 1 and 3). While this theory was not confirmed (See Chapter 3), the evidently small sampl e (i.e. N = 21) eligible for the analyses in Experiment 1 certainly makes it difficult to rule out the possibility that the theory is still valid. Therefore, via a less under -sampled experiment \u2014in which 135 participants would be subjected to a normatively unfair treatment (i.e. a conditional offer receipt) \u2014I strive to re -examine the hypothesi sed indebtedness -sanctioning link via benefit appraisals (i.e. the Cognitive Restructuring Hypothesis (Greenberg, 1980; Greenberg & Westcott, 1983)). It is, meanwhile, worthwhile to point out that the chronological order of the present three experiments and the meta -analysis was not identical to the ordering of the present thesis. The meta -analysis (i.e. Chapter 2) on the gratitude -prosociality associat ion was indeed conducted after the completion of data collection of Experiments 1 to 3 (i.e. Chapters 3 to 5). Indeed, as outlined in Chapter 2 there is considerable inconsistency in the literature in regards how strongly gratitude (as a state or a disposi tion) is linked toward prosociality. This, coupled with the non -existence of empirical works on the indebtedness - prosociality link, should render any valid a-priori power analyses to estimate the necessary Ns very difficult. A more in -depth discussion abou t the statistical power issue and the null findings of Experiments 1 to 3 will be featured in the General Discussion chapter (i.e. Chapter 6). 4.1.3. Possible Factors behind Cheap -riding Chapter 4 133 Below (i.e. Sub -sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2) I discuss certa in key factors that may contribute to or undermine cheap -riding . They included the provision of 'Just Deserts' (Weinstein, 2011), gratitude and indebtedness. 4.1.3.1. Provision of 'Just Deserts' (Carlsmith, Darley, & Robinson, 2002) One suggested po ssible motive behind cheap -riding in Experiment 1 lies in the provision of 'Just Deserts' (Darley, Carlsmith, & Robinson, 2000; Santos & Rivera, 2015). That is, via paying back partially the cheap -riders intended to communicate their discontent with their helpers' belittlement of normative fairness, and that the amount repaid should be indicative of what they perceived their helpers 'genuinely deserved'(Ma et al., 2014). This explanation resonates with the 'Just Deserts' Theory of Retribution (Carlsmith et al., 2002; Starkweather, 1992; Wong, 2006) which argues that punishment cannot be equated to sheer vengeance, as a fair punisher will also contemplate how a punishment would measure up to the damage done (Moore, 1997). Accordingly, an appropriate sanction should be one that is proportionate to the initial harm so that the 'moral balance' can be restored following the implementation of such (Dyckman, 1998; Wenzel & Thielmann, 2006). Going back to the cheap -riding situation of Experiment 1, participants were aware a priori that their repayment (or the lack thereof) would indeed affect their co -players' ultimate payoffs. As a result, to cheap -ride\u2014when free - riding was also feasible and clearly a more rational choice \u2014in this situation can be interpreted as the recipients trying to convey a message like: 'You are a cheapskate and I am having a go at you for that, and I'd like you to have a re - think of what you did! ' Thus, these cheap -riders were making a case that the helpers deserved their comeuppances, and hopefully this may get the helpers to Chapter 4 134 repent a bit and stop doing that to others in the future (Ma et al., 2014). It is worth noting that cheap -riding of this kind should transcend beyond the simple negative 'tit -for-tat' (Brown, 1986), given that the main pu rpose of cheap -riding here is not about avenging oneself (if that is the case people should have 'free - rode' instead), but for preserving mutual adherence to normative fairness in the long run (i.e. ' Strong Reciprocity ', Bowles and Gintis (2004)). Buildin g on this logic, dodging the repayment in its entirety (i.e. free- riding ) may have defeated this purpose. That is because the null payment may offer the perfect excuse for any 'free -rode' helpers to retrospectively rationali se their initial miserliness (Carroll & Meeks, 1999). As a result, not only will these norm -breaking helpers refuse to repent their own misdeed, they will also be livid with the recipients' hostile gestures and therefore become even more inclined to be ungen erous to others in the future (Ma et al., 2014). Cheap -riding, on the contrary, should give rise to a lower likelihood for such a self -justification. I argued that the act of cheap -riding may propel the helpers to ponder why they were just partially but n ot totally defaulted. Consequently, these 'cheap -rode' helpers should be more able to think through if their initial fairness -violating act (i.e. only helped conditionally ) was what earned them the partial under -repayment (Ma et al., 2014). Taken tog ether, this whole 'Just Desert' perspective of sanction (Carlsmith et al., 2002; Darley et al., 2000) would argue that cheap -riding may serve a similar purpose as altruistic punishment (Boyd, Gintis, Bowles, & Richerson, 2003; Fehr & G\u00e4chter, 2002; normative fairness (Fehr, Fischbacher, & G\u00e4chter, 2002) . That is, via incurring a cost to themselves in their partial repayment the cheap -riders aimed to incite Chapter 4 135 more prosociality (in the form of normatively fair behaviours) from t heir partners in the future (See Boyd et al., 2003; Egas & Ridel, 2008). 4.1.3.2. Gratitude, Indebtedness, and Cheap -riding As the present thesis primarily concerns the investigation into how gratitude nurtures cooperativeness in economic exchanges, there is no reason to not look into how gratitude (as a state or a trait) may relate to cheap -riding. Below I discuss also how state indebtedness might prompt cheap -riding . 1) Gratitude and Cheap -riding McCullough and associates (McCullough et al., 2001; McCu llough and Tsang, 2004; McCullough et al., 2008) maintained that gratitude fosters endeavours to repay the benefactors' kindness via one of its fundamental functions as a moral motive (i.e. the 'Moral Motive' Hypothesis). This Moral Motive perspective stip ulates that the gratitude emotion should push the recipient toward not only contributing to the benefactors' future well-being, but also the inhibition of any destructive acts toward whom gratitude was felt. Moreover, the Moral Barometer Hypothesis of gr atitude (McCullough, et al., 2001) argues that the mere presence (or absence) of the gratitude experience already signals to a recipient whether a benefit was worth feeling grateful for. People only experience gratitude toward a benefit if certain paramete rs are met (McCullough et al., 2008). They included; a) a recognition that the benefit symboli ses a token of benevolence ; b) a perception that the benefit is of value ; and c) the knowledge about the intentionality of the conferment of that benefit (i.e. whether that was by chance or deliberate ). Thus, the above two moral hypotheses of gratitude imply that gratitude and the punishment of one's benefactor should have no room for co -existence. Chapter 4 136 Nonetheless, as addresse d above cheap -riding at present should represent a punitive act which is intended to serve a correctional purpose in the long run (Egas & Ridel, 2008; Fehr et al., 2002) \u2014as the cheap -riders believed that via giving the helpers their 'just deserts' (Carlsmi th et al., 2002; Darley, 2001; Darley et al., 2000) the latter will make amends by showing more adherence to the fairness norm in the future (Ma et al., 2014). As a result, it should be impossible to fathom a situation in which on one hand, someone feels g rateful toward a helper's benevolence but at the same time, still feels like punishing that very same helper to assure that he/she will treat others better in the future. The Social -Cognitive Model of Gratitude (i.e. SCMG (Wood et al., 2008) theorise d that people with high dispositional gratitude have a tendency to see the positives in the daily encounters. Thus these people should be more prone to 'over -rate' the benefits bestowed upon them (by perceiving more kindness in the benefit conferment), which should be translated to more intense feelings of gratitude (Nadler, 2012; Tsang, 2006b), and ultimately a higher tendency to return the kindness (See Tsang, 2006a, 2007; Tsang et al., 2012). Building upon this sequence of reasoning, there is again no reason to argue that dispositional gratitude would in any way encourage any punitive a cts toward the benefactors in cheap - or free-riding . On the contrary, the SCMG should predict an inverse, indirect relationship between dispositional gratitude and defaulting (cheap - and free -riding inclusive) that is serially mediated (Hayes, 2013) by i) benefit appraisals , followed by ii) state gratitude. See Figure 4.1 . Figure 4.1 The SCMG (Wood et al., 2008) Predictions on Cheap -/Free -riding Dispositional Gratitude (DG) Cheap -riding /Free -riding Chapter 4 137 2) Indebtedness and Cheap -riding Greenberg and Westcott (1983) theorise d that there are two major avenues through which a recipient could manage his/her benefit -triggered feeling of indebtedness. They are, 1) direct or indirect reciprocation; and 2) Cognitive Restructuring . While the former can be likened to the act of paying off a debt (Schaumberg & Flynn, 2009), the latter entails a re -appraisal of the exchange which, in the first place, prompted indebtedness (Greenberg, 1980). Specifically, a recipient may revisit and accordingly query his/her initial appraisal of the whole benefit conferment scenario. Questions such as 'Was the gift really that kind -intentioned?' or 'Was it really that much of a fuss for that helper to have benefited me?' may be pondered over (Greenberg, 1980). All these thinking may \u2014as theorise d by Greenbe rg and Westcott (1983) \u2014give rise to a negative and possibly distorted re-assessment of the benefit exchange (e.g. 'He/she is helping me because he/she has a 'benevolent' reputation to maintain), which accordingly rids the recipients of any indebtedness -invoked discomfort (Greenberg & Shaprio, 1971). Additionally, the link between perceived negative intent and sanctioning has been well documented in the experimental economics literature (Fehr & G\u00e4chter, 2002; Falk & Fischbacher, 2006).As reiterated througho ut the present thesis, cheap -riding in this context exemplifies a form of sanction intended for norm enforcement (Ma et al., 2014; Weinstein, 2011). Thus, the Cognitive Restructuring Hypothesis (i.e. CRH) (Greenberg, 1980; Greenberg & Westcott, 1983) will argue that benefit -triggered indebtedness may prompt a more cynical benefit re -appraisal \u2014which should comprise a perception of ill intent from the Chapter 4 138 helper (Hatfield & Sprecher, 1983), with that perceived malice ultimately leading to a sanctioning response i n cheap -riding . 4.1.4. Exploratory Aims of Experiment 2 Overall, via Experiment 2 I intended to complement Experiment 1 and examine how emotions (especially gratitude and indebtedness ) would relate to cheap -riding in an economic game context. These were achieved with the assistance of a one -shot game that is similar to the one used in Experiment 1 (See Section 4.2 for details about the experimental design and rationales). Below (i.e. Sub -sections 4.1.4.1 and 4.1.4. 2) I summari se the two principal exploratory aims and the respective predictions of Experiment 2. 4.1.4.1. Exploratory Aim 1: Does more (normative) unfairness count? Chapter 3 indicated that people would respond differently upon receipt of a normatively fair (i.e. 'unconditional' offer) as opposed to an unfair (i.e. 'conditional ' offer) treatment. Particularly, the serial mediational model (See Chapter 3) emphatically corroborated the significance of the injunctive fairness norm (Elster, 2006; Paddock, 20 05) in guiding a positive helper intent attribution, which then prompts gratitude and ultimately a (direct) reciprocal intention. The behavioural data evidenced a display of sanctioning (mostly in the form of cheap -riding ) among those unfairly treated reci pients. Via Experiment 2 I intend to further look into one interesting issue: is there an 'all -or-nothing' threshold for fairness attribution? Data of Experiment 1 revealed an absence of differences in emotional and behavioural responses from recipients of offers of varying conditionality , implying that an increasing extent of unfairness would not bother the recipients. Since the injunctive norm stipulated that a fair gesture in Experiment 1 entails the provision of a 'free' Chapter 4 139 help (Elster, 2006; Frey & Bohnet, 1995), the varying extent of expected repayment (i.e. conditionality) should connote different 'severity' of violation in normative fairness (Cialdini et al., 1990). As such, it should be logical to anticipate a graded patte rn of i) emotional negativity (e.g. more indebtedness) so as positivity (e.g. less gratitude) towards, or ii) an overt sanctioning (e.g. cheap - or free -riding) against, offers with increasing (normative) unfairness. Hence, one principal exploratory aim of Experiment 2 \u2014in which 135 participants were all due to receive an unfair conditional offer \u2014 entails how the increasing normative unfairness would relate to more emotional negativity (e.g. more indebtedness and less gratitude ) and sanctioning (i.e . cheap -ride or free- ride). Similar to Experiment 1, participants acknowledged that their helpers had not legitimately 'earned' their positions as potential helpers (Fahr & Irlenbusch, 2000; Frey & Bohnet, 1995; Hoffman et al., 1994), thus all repayment obligations attached to the offer should constitute no moral legitimacy (Elster, 2006). As a result, all offers in Experiment 2 should be in principle normatively unfair (Ma et al., 2014), with the severity of this unfairness being a manipulation at present (see Section 4.2 for details). 4.1.4.2. Exploratory Aim 2: The Psychology of Cheap -riders Further to scrutiny over how situations (i.e. injunctive unfairness) could contribute to people's decision to cheap -ride, a key obje ctive of Experiment 2 entails the analysis the psychological correlates of cheap -riding . First, I analysed benefit -triggered emotions (i.e. the 'pre -repayment emotions) would predict people's repayment decisions. The current analysis would in particular shed light upon how state gratitude and indebtedness will be associated with participants' sanctioning decisions (i.e. cheap - or free-riding). Chapter 4 140 1) Affective Gratitude, Indebtedness and Sanctioning in Experiment 2 As elaborated above (i.e., sub -section 4.1.3.2 ) emotional gratitude , thanks to its two moral functions as a moral barometer and moral motive (McCullough et al., 2001; McCullough et al., 2008), should in no way promote endeavours to harm the benefactors' well -being. Hence, a strong inverse relationship between recipients' state gratitude and the magnitude of under - repayment should be expected. I also predicted a sharp contrast between the cooperators' state gratitude and that of both the cheap -riders and free -riders. By contrast, state indebtedness could incite cognitive restructuring which results in perceptions of malicious intent in the helpers' gestures, with these negative attributions capable of inciting sa nctioning behaviours. Greenberg and Westcott (1983) also stated that a double -blinded , one-shot exchange context will constitute an ideal breeding platform for Cognitive Restructuring to be resorted to ahead of reciprocation . Given that both these features were retained in the present game, it should be logical to predict a positive, indirect link between state indebtedness and magnitude of under - payment which is mediated by benefit appraisals. Figure 4.2 illustrates the path model outlined by this Cognitive Restructuring Hypothesis (CRH). Figure 4.2 The CRH: effect of state indebtedness on under -repayment. 2) Differentiating Cheap -riding , Cooperating and Free -riding Via eleven post -repayment survey items (as detailed in Ta ble 4.1 below) I specifically probed into the motives behind the offer acceptors' various repayment decisions (i.e. to cheap -ride, cooperate or free -ride). Four items were adapted from Ferguson and Flynn (2016) to measure experienced warm -glow State Indebtedness ( Is) Benefit Appraisal (BA) Under -repayment % (UR %) Chapter 4 141 (Cronbach's = .802, N of items = 4) Warm -glow is defined as a sense of internal satisfaction derived from a person's act of cooperativeness (Andreoni, 1990; Harbaugh, 1998; Holmes, 2009) which has been extensively proven to underlie prosociality in the experimental economics literature (e.g. Khanna et al., 1995; Carpenter et al., 2008; Crumpler & Grossman, 2008). Hence, there is no reason to overlook how warm -glow may at present foster trustworthiness (i.e. cooperativeness) among the acceptors \u2014thus in a way undermine their urge to cheap - or to free-ride. An example item will be 'It made me feel emotionally positive about myself to have repaid (or have avoided the repayment).' Table 4. 1. Survey Items for Repayment Motives Questions Adapted From The fact that I repaid/did not repay made me feel good about myself Experienced Warm -Glow (EWG) (Ferguson & Flynn, 2016) It made me feel emotionally positive about myself to have repaid/have avoided the repayment Ferguson and Flynn (2016) - EWG I feel irritated by my partner's request for a repayment.

Self-created \u2014Just Desert I see my Repayment/Non -repayment as a retaliatory act against my partner's offer Self-created \u2014NTFT I see my repayment/non -repayment best signifies how grateful I feel towards my partner.

Self-created \u2014Just Desert I repaid / did not repay because I endeavoured to attain a relatively more equal payoff distribution between me and my partner Self-created \u2014Just Desert *Reverse -scored for the Reliability -for-Tat' Three self -created items (Cronbach's = .649, N of items = 3) were included to measure whether the urge to provide the helpers with their 'just deserts' (Carlsmith et al., 2002; Darley, 2001; Weinstein, 2011) will be related to the acceptors' decision to cheap -ride. An example item will be 'By repaying or not repaying, I manage to offer my partner what he/she truly deserves'. I furthe r included four self -created items (Cronbach's = .650, N of items = 4) to measure how an acceptor's negative 'tit -for-tat' (i.e. NTFT) mentality Chapter 4 142 (Brown, 1986; Massey, 2009) will be related to his/her cheap - or free-riding decisions. An example item will be 'I see my repayment or non -repayment as a means to punish my partner for his or her unreasonable request'. Taken together, via these eleven survey items (See Table 4.1) I intended to gather an insight into the mindset of a cheap -rider at present. And m ore importantly, I endeavoured to underscore if, and how, such a cheap -rider's mindset will deviate from that of a cooperator and of a free-rider . 3) Dispositional Gratitude and Under -repayment Figure 4.3 The SCMG serially mediated prediction of DG on Under -repayment I tested how benefit appraisals and state gratitude could serially mediate (Hayes, 2013) the path between dispositional gratitude and under - repayment percentage (as an inverse measure of trustworthiness). Hence, by testing the path model as illustrated in Figure 4.3 I examined if dispositional gratitude would restrain defaulting (both cheap - and free-riding inclusive) the way as theorise d in the Social Cognitive Model of Gratitude (SCMG) (Wood et al., 2008). This under -repayment percentage (i.e. UR %) is given by the formula: '[ Obligated Repayment - Actual Repayment] * 100%. 4.2. Methods 4.2.1. Participants One hundred and thirty -five students from The University of Nottingham participated in Experiment 2 (81 were females, mean age: 21. 1 years, SD = 3. 6 years). Each participant was paid an inconvenience allowance of \u00a32 and was aware that they could earn up to \u00a33.50 more . Dispositional Gratitude (DG) Benefit Appraisal (BA) Affective Gratitude (Gs) Under - repayment percentage Chapter 4 143 4.2.2. Game and its Rationale The experiment was administered using Z -Tree (Fischbacher, 2007). To begin with, each participant was seated in a separate cubicle and asked to read the instructions. Each session took place with groups of four to ten. All participants played the game on their own although they were told that they each would play with a random partner (i.e. a fellow participant) in pairs. Each player was initially endowed with 150 money -equivalent 'Bonus Points' and was aware that he/she needed at least 50 points more to reach the 'Bonus Threshold' (i.e. 200) .Reaching this 200 -point mark (i.e. Bonus Threshold'), by rolling the fair, six -sided dice once, was the only way participants could leave the experiment with any additiona l bonus money . The possible payoffs were a loss of 50 points, 0 points, and gains of 50, 100, 150, and 200 points. It was again emphasi sed that the magnitude of the number rolled had no direct association with the final allocations of bonus points . Each player then learned that he/she had a n in-game, unidentifiable and anonymous 'partner' . Neither competitions nor collaboration with this 'partner' would be necessary . Regardless of the actual die -roll, participants were all pre - programmed to end up with on ly 100 points which were below the 200 -point threshold, leaving them zero bonuses. Each participant then learned that his/her 'partner' had emerged 'victorious' by acquiring 350 points at the end, entitling them to a \u00a33.50 bonus. In short, unlike Experimen t 1, all participants in the current game were potential recipients (i.e. P2s). 4.2.3. Receipts of the Normatively Unfair, Conditional offers All participants then learned that their partners had offered to entrust part of their excess bonus points (i.e. 150) to help them attain that 200 -point Chapter 4 144 mark. Specifically, by accepting these offers \u2014which enabled the recipients to earn some bonus money \u2014these acceptors took on the obligation to make varying back -transfers (out of their new earnings) to their helpers. Indeed, the lack of moral legitimacy for a 'winner' to make his/her sharing conditional in this particular context had been reiterated throughout the chapters. Thus, all offers as presently constructed should be injunctively unfair. 4.2.4. Manipulating Conditionality: Does more unfairness matter? Figure 4.4. The sequence of behavioural decisions to be made by a participant I manipulated this normative unfairness across offers by subjecting recipients to offers with varying conditionalities. These included; an ' Interest - free' offer where the acceptors only had to repay the 'principal' ( N = 32); or a 'surcharged ' offer whereby acceptors wou ld repay the principal plus an interest charge. The levels of these interest charges were further manipulated as a Cheap -riders to INDICATE specifically How Much they would like to repay their partners Die-rolling (Endowment - 150; Bonus Threshold - 200) Failure to reach the 200 - point mark \u2014i.e. a 'donation' is warranted Receipt of a Conditional offer (Manipulati on of Normative Unfairness) Interest -Free (N= 32) 12.5% Interest (N= 33) 25% Interest (N= 34) 50% Interest (N= 36) Recipients to Accept or Decline the offer Accepted Rejected Reminder of Obligated Repayment shown Repay as agreed (i.e. Cooperate ) Repay NOTHING (i.e. Free-ride) Repay SOMETHING (i.e. Cheap -ride) Chapter 4 145 participant could receive either a 12.5% - (N = 33); or a 25%- (N = 34) or a 50%-Interest offer ( N = 36). Recipients were told upfront and lat er on reminded that it would make more financial sense accepting the offer (in spite of the repayment) than rejecting that. Recipients at this stage had no idea about a) the availability of alternative offers; and 2) the non -binding nature of the repayment clause. Figure 4.4 illustrates the flow of behavioural decisions. 4.2.5. Recipients' Emotional Reactions toward the unfair offers Table 4.2 Pre -repayment Survey Items Pre-repayment Survey Items Constructs I am a nnoyed by my partner's decision State Annoyance How much gratitude would you feel towards your partner? State Gratitude I feel indebted to my partner State Indebtedness How much do you consider your partner's transfer is motivated by his/her sincere desire to help you?' Perceived Genuine Helpfulness I feel obliged to repay my partner . State Obligation My partner was being fair to have offered his/her help Perceived Fairness My partner's decision is reasonable. Perceived Reasonableness My partner's decision is understandable. Understandability How valuable do you consider that your partner's help is to you ? Perceived Value in Help How much did it cost your partner to help you (1: Nothing ; 7: A Great Deal ) Perceived Cost to Helper I am eager to help my partner out if he/she is in need in the near future Reciprocity Tendency Recipients then rated items (i.e. pre -repayment ratings) in relation to their offer -triggered emotions. Table 4.2 presents the list of items and the psychological constructs represented by each of them. Particularly, the item 'how much gratitude would you feel towards your partner' was adopted to represent the construct state gratitude at present, which was used to examine the current gratitude -related hypotheses such as i) the Moral Barometer and Moral Motive Hypothesis of Gratitude (McCullough et al., 200 1; McCullough et al., 2008), and ii) the Social Cognitive Model of Gratitude (SCMG) (Wood et al., 2008). The item 'I feel indebted to my partner' will represent the construct state indebtedness that is tested in the present Cognitive Restructuring Hypothes is (CRH) (Greenberg, 1980; Greenberg & Westcott, 1983). Additionally, following Wood et al.'s (2008) procedures, I averaged the three items ' Perceived Value in Help ', 'Perceived Genuine Helpfulness ' and Chapter 4 146 'Perceived Cost to Helpers ' to form the composite 'Benefit Appraisals' (Cronbach's = .691, N of items = 3) \u2014which is indeed an integral component in both the Social Cognitive Model of Gratitude (Wood et al., 2008) and Cognitive Restructuring Hypothesis (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983 ). 4.2.6. Behavioural Repayment Decisions Figure 4.5 An example reminder of obligated repayment among offer acceptors Participants who accepted their offers were then shown onscreen a reminder of how much they were expected to repay (See Figure 4.5). Imme diately after that reminder participants were facing a forced -choices scenario as they contemplated whether to repay a) 'Nothing At All' (i.e. free- riding ), b) 'Some of Agreed Amount' (i.e. cheap -riding ), or c) 'the Whole of the Agreed Repayment' (i.e. cooperating ). Participants who selected to cheap -ride were then instructed to specify the magnitude of their desired repayment (See Figure 4.4). I conceded that while this explicit segregation facilitated the categorisation of repayment this may have als o brought forth the 'Response Effect ' that might have predisposed the participants into selecting a particular option (Feldman, 1989; Zaller & Feldman, 1992). Refer to the General Discussion chapter (Chapter 6) for more discussions about the 'Response Effe ct' and how that may be resolved in future investigations. 4.2.7. Reasons for Repaying (or not repaying) Chapter 4 147 Immediately after repaying participants were instructed to rate 11 items (See Figure 4.5) that served to explore the motives behind the way they repaid or (did not repay). Sub -section 4.1.4.2 detailed the rationales for the inclusion of these items Partic ipants were then shown onscreen their respective compensations, and consequently asked to fill out two questionnaires, namely the i) Impression Management Scale (i.e. IMS) (Paulhus, 1991), ii) Gratitude Questionnaire -VI (i.e. GQ -VI) (McCullough et al., 200 2). Via the IMS (Cronbach's = .797, N of items = 20) and GQ -VI (Cronbach's = .690, N of items = 6) I measured respectively, participants' 1) tendencies to make decisions to manage own social impression, and 2) dispositional gratitude. The experiment en ded here and the participants were debriefed and paid . Figure 4.5. Post -repayment Survey Items 4.2.8. Ethics Statement Experiment 2 was approved by the ethics committee of the School of Psychology at the University of Nottingham. All participants were older than 17 and all provided written, informed consent prior to participation as approved by the ethics committee (Approved 14th Aug 2013; Ref. Code: 332). Chapter 4 148 4.3. Results 4.3.1. Descriptive Data All 135 participants received a conditional offer (32 received an 'Interest -free', 33 a '12.5% -interest', 34 a '25% -interest' and 36 a '50% - interest' offer). Of these 48 rejected their offers (i.e. 35.56% (48/135) rejection; 64.44% (87/135) acceptance, 2 (1, N = 135) = 10.7, p = .0011 . Among these 87 acceptors 59 repaid fully (i.e. cooperate ), 11 repaid nothing (i.e. free-ride) and 17 repaid partially (i.e. cheap -ride). Particularly, these 17 cheap -riders on average repaid 56.4% ( SD: 31.5) of the obligations, which was not different ( U = 54.00, p = .744) from that of the seven cheap -riders from Experiment 1 ( M: 58.4%). Figure 4.6 illustrates the present decision tree . Figure 4.6. Decision Tree of the participants ( N = 135) 4.3.2. Exploratory Aim 1: Does more (normative) unfairness count? One key exploratory aim of Experiment 2 entails whether the increasing severity of normative unfairness would prompt a graded pattern of emotional negativity, and ultimately more sanctioning in the form of cheap - or free-riding. Receipt of a' taxed' (N = 32) 12.5% Interest (N = 33) 25%-Interest (N = 34) 50%-Interest (N = 36) Recipients to Accept or Decline the offer Accepted ( N =87) Rejected ( N = 48) To repay IN FULL (i.e. Cooperate , N = 59) To repay NOTHING (i.e. Free-ride, N = 11) To repay PARTIALLY (i.e. Cheap -ride, N = 17) Cheap -riders INDICATED how much they decided to repay (Mean Repayment % (i.e. Actual/ Expected repayment * 100%): 56.39 %; SD: 31.53) Chapter 4 149 Below I examined whe ther the present manipulation of injunctive unfairness (i.e. levels of conditionality) would impact on, a) participants' emotions toward the offers (i.e. Sub -section 4.3.2.1); or b) the acceptors' (N= 87) categorical and numerical repayment decisions (i.e. Sub-section 4.3.2.2). 4.3.2.1 . Levels of Conditionality on Emotions towards offer A one -way ANOVA was conducted to examine the effect of offer conditionality (i.e. Interest -free vs. 12.5% - vs. 25% 50% -Interest) over participants' offer -triggered emot ions. Table 4.3 illustrates the findings. Table 4.3.

This echoes Experiment 1's results whereby a more unreasonable offer, which in principle epitomi ses more injunctive unfairness , would not irk the r ecipients (in an existing unfair arrangement) even further. Interestingly, results of the independent samples t -tests (See Table 4.4 below) demonstrated that compared to the 87 acceptors, the 48 rejectors reported lower offer -triggered 1) state gratitude , 2) state indebtedness , and 3) a Chapter 4 150 less positive overall benefit appraisal (Wood et al., 2008) (all ps <. 05, two - tailed). The rejectors also deemed the offers as less reasonable (p = .048) and were marginally ( p = .061) less willing to reciprocate (Ma et al. , 2014).

These results suggest that not only did the increasing unfairness (i.e. conditionality) of the offers not trigger more emotional negativity (less positivity), there was no effect on offer acceptances (or rejections) either . 4.3.2.2. Levels of Conditionality on Acceptors' Repayment I then tested whether a 'harsher' offer would prompt more eventual sanctioning in cheap - or free -riding among the 87 acceptors. The present analyses concerned both the categorical (i.e. cheap -ride vs. free-ride vs. cooperate ) and the numerical facets of the acceptors' repayment decisions. The latter was given by the metrics under -repayment percentage (i.e. UR %). 1) Unfairness and Sanctioning (Part 1: Categorical ) I had to scrap the originall y planned 3 ( Repayment : Cheap - vs. Free - riding vs. Cooperating) * 4 ( Conditionality ) Chi -square test due to the present Chapter 4 151 low counts of both cheap - (N = 17) and free -riders ( N = 11), as there will be extremely small tally in a few cells (e.g. 1 or 2) which renders the whole analysis meaningless. Thus in this specific analysis I aggregated the counts of both cheap - and free -riders to create the category defaulters . The 2 ( Default ers (N = 28) vs. Cooperators (N = 59)) * 4 ( Conditionality ) Chi -square test again indicated no interaction between the two ( 2 (3) = 1.58, p =. 68) , signalling a null effect of varying offer unfairness on acceptors' decisions to default or not. 2) Unfairness and Sanctioning (Part 2: Numerical ) I administered a One -way ANOVA on the effect of offer conditionality on the acceptors' under -repayment rates (i.e. UR %). The results, which were summari sed in Table 4.5 below, indicated no evidence that more unfairly treated acceptors would under -repay more when opportunities beckoned. Table 4.5. Effect of Offer Conditionality over UR% One-way ANOVA of effect by Offer N Mean 3.99 3 0.802 (.496) Taken together , the present analyses hinted that a more (or less) deviation from the injunctive norm of fairness \u2014which stipulated in this context that a typical fair 'winner' should help the 'loser' unconditionally especially when the former simply rode his/her luck to that 'victory' (Ma et al., 2014) \u2014did not matter. The analyses revealed neither signs of 1) more emotional negativity, nor 2) any different pattern of behavioural responses in offer acceptances and sanctioning decisions in cheap - or free-riding , from recipients of more unfair offers. These results seemed to give a resounding no to the present exploratory aim 'does more unfairness matter'. Meanwhile, the results which showed that acceptors reported more 1) emotional positivity (e.g. Chapter 4 152 state gratitu de, reasonableness and so on), and a 2) more positive benefit appraisal than rejectors, is certainly an intriguing and somewhat a surprise finding that warrants a more in -depth discussion later (See Section 4.4.2). 4.3.3. Exploratory Aim 2: The Psychology of Cheap -riders Another key exploratory aim of Experiment 2 entails the scrutiny of psychological correlates of cheap -riding . Thus, the upcoming three sub -sections (i.e. 4.3.3.1 to 4.3.3.3) would examine the following topics: 1) State Gratitude, Indebtedness and Sanctioning (Sub -section 4.3.3.1); 2) Differentiating Cooperation , Cheap - and Free -riding (Sub -section 4.3.3.2); Gratitude and Cheap 4.3.3.1 State Gratitude, Indebtedness, and sanc tioning Throughout this chapter I reiterated why I predicted state gratitude to undermine under -repayment (i.e. cheap - and free-riding inclusive ) (the Moral Motive and Moral Barometer Hypotheses of Gratitude, McCullough et al., 2001). I discussed also how state indebtedness will indirectly prompt more under -repayment via a more cynical benefit appraisal (Cognitive Restructuring Hypothesis (CRH), Greenberg and Westcott, 1983)) (Refer to Figure 4.2).Hence, this sub -section would feature the following analyses : i) A Kruskal -Wallis test on the 87 acceptors' pre -repayment ratings (e.g. state gratitude and indebtedness), on the basis of their nominal repayment decisions (i.e. to cheap -ride, free-ride or cooperate). Table 4.6 details the statistics; ii) A Spearma n's correlational analysis between the acceptors' pre -repayment ratings and their under -repayment rates (UR %). Table 4.7 details the results; iii) A path analysis via PROCESS (Hayes, 2013) on the indirect effect of state indebtedness over UR%. Table 4.8 a nd Figure 4.7 present the findings. Chapter 4 153 Table 4. 6 Pre -repayment ratings by Acceptors' repayment decisions ( N = 87) Categorical Repayment Decisions (N= 87) Cooperatea Cheap -rideb Free-ridec Median Median Median df H(p-value) State Gratitude 5 5 5 2 0.12 (.942) State Annoyance 2 2 3 2 3.27 (.195) State Indebtedness 5 4 5 2 3.93 (.140) Obligation to repay 6 5 5 2 3.34 (.188) Benefit Appraisald 4.67 4.67 4 2 1.02 (.601) Tendency to Reciprocate 6 6 4 2 11.1 (.004**) Reasonableness 5 5 5 2 0.32 (.322) Understandability 5 5 5 2 0.20 (.201) Perceived Fairness 5 5 5 2 0.94 (.935) Note . aN = 59. bN = 17, cN = 11. ** p <.01 (two -sided). As detailed in Table 4.6, acceptors' categorical repayment decisions had not differentiated ( ps > .10) almost all the pre -repayment survey ratings. The only exception was the item 'tendency to reciprocate' ( p = .004), where free - riders understandably reported feeling less looking forward \u2014than both cheap - riders ( p = .014) and cooperators (p =.003) \u2014to helping their helpers back. In short, the present acceptors' differential repayment choice could not be attributed to them experiencing varying gratitude towards the helpers.

Once again, the data failed to confirm the prediction that state gratitude would dimin ish or even rule out sanctioning (cheap - and free-riding inclusive). Chapter 4 154 Nevertheless, the current small portions of cheap -riders (N = 17) may render the analysis underpowered thus not allowing many conclusions to be drawn.

The 95% bias -corrected bootstrap confidence inter vals for the effect (i.e. ab: 0.48* -0.74 = -0.30) \u2014based upon 5000 (i.e. -1.72 to 0.69), indicating non -significance (Field, 2013). Contrary to what Greenberg and Westcott (1983) theorise d, state indebtedness had indeed elicited a more favourable (a = 0.48, p = .023) overall appraisal (cost of helping, perceived helper's sincerity, and perceived value in the benefit) of the offers. This positive benefit appraisal (Wood et al., 2008), however, fail ed to impact upon the under -repayment rate ( b = -0.62, p = .61 ). Figure 4.7 A statistical diagram of the path model of the effect of state indebtedness over under -repayment percentage Note. N = 87; * p <.05 (two -tailed); n,s.= Non -significant at p <.05 (two -tailed) Additionally, as detailed above indebtedness was revealed to have neither a) differentiated acceptors based on their categorical repayment (i.e. cheap - vs. free-ride vs. cooperate, See Table 4.6), nor b) correlated to their magnitude of under -repayment (See Table 4.7). Taken together, state X M Y State Indebtedness Benefit Appraisal Under -repayment rate a = 0.48* . c = -0.738 , n.s. Chapter 4 155 indebtedness was not demonstrated to have \u2014indirectly or directly \u2014 impacted on people's sanctioning decisions in Experiment 2 as hypothesi sed. 4.3.3.2 Differentiating Cooperation , Cheap - and Free -riding The above suggested that the various emotions upon offer receipt could not account for the acceptors' differential repayment decisions. Hence, the present sub -section would address the principal axis analysis conducted on the post-repayment items ( Refer to Table 4.1 for the items). Particularly, through this exploratory factor analysis I aimed to a) garner insight on why acceptors would (or would not) repay in this context and crucially, b) tease apart the psychology of cheap -riders from that of free-riders and of cooperators. 1) Overview and Results of the present Principal Axis Analysis (PAA) The Kaiser -Meyer -Olkin (i.e. KMO hereafter) measure verified the 'middling' (Hutcheson & Sofroniou, 1999) sampling adequacy (i.e. KMO = .784) of the prese nt PAA. The diagonals of the anti -image correlation matrices were all above .5 (See Table 4.8 below) \u2014which justified the inclusion of each item in the current analysis (Field, 2013). The Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant, 2 (55) = 373.43 , p < .001. Upon inspection of the Scree Plot, three factors with Eigenvalues over 1.0 were extracted. These factors in aggregate explained 54.23 % of the total variance. The items that clustered on the same factors highlight that Factor 1 represented the 'Exper ienced Warm -Glow ' (Ferguson & Flynn, 2016) (Eigenvalue = 1.73; Factor Loadings = .43 to .88; Cronbach's = .822), Factor 2 as ' Justice Pursuit ' (Eigenvalue 1.64; Factor Loadings = .40 to .81; Cronbach's = .770), and Factor 3 as ' Retaliation/ Punitive Responses ' (Eigenvalue = 1.64; Factor Loadings = .55 to .87; Cronbach's = .711). Reliability analyses showed that Chapter 4 156 all three factors had 'meritorious' reliabilities (i.e. all s >.70) (George & Mallery, 2003). Factor loadings below .40 were all suppressed . I also applied the 'separation of .15 guideline' in the event of double -loading (Bundick, 2011; Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007; Worthington & Whittaker, 2006). For instance, I suppressed the item DD's (See Table 4.9 below) factor loadings (.428) on the factor 'Experienced Warm -glow' as this item was evidently more strongly loaded (i.e. difference exceeds .15) on the factor 'Justice Pursuit' (.809). Lastly, items of the same factor were averaged to form the composite factor scores (El - Alayli & Mess\u00e9 , 2004). Tab le 4.9 details the key information of the PAA.

See Sub - section 4.3.3.2 above for a more in -depth discussion about the suppression criteria. 2) Dissociating Cooperation , Cheap -riding, and Free -riding Chapter 4 157 First, correlational analyses revealed a strong association ( r (85) = .69, p <.001) between indices 'Experienced Warm -Glow (i.e. EWG hereafter)' ( M = 4.97, SD = 1.29 ) and 'Justice Pursuit (i.e. JP hereafter)' ( M = 5.06, SD = 1.2 8). Meanwhile, index ' Retaliat ion/ Punitive Responses (i.e. RPR hereafter) ( M = 2.72, SD = 1.2 8) did not correlate with either EWG or FP (both ps >. 05). ANOVAs 17), free-riders (N= 11) and cooperators (N = 59) would score differ ently on any of these factor scores (See Table 4.10). The Tukey's HSD post-hoc analyses were administered to break down any significant main effects. Table 4.10.

Fact or Score Justice Pursuit by Repayment Decisions ( N = 87) As can be seen in Table 4.10 there are significant main effects (all ps <.01) by repayment decisions on all the three factor scores. Specifically, the Tukey -HSD analyses revealed that cheap -riders 5.33; SD: 1.25) in using Justice Pursuit (e.g. 'giving partner what I think he/she truly deserves') to rationali se their repayment. By contrast, free-riders (M: 3.64; SD: 1.05) were less inclined \u2014 than cheap -riders and cooperators (both ps <.01) \u2014to rationali se their zero back -transfer as a pursuit of justice (See Figure 4.8). Figure 4.9 Factor Experienced Warm -Glow by Repayment Decisions ( N = 87) Meanwhile, as highlighted in Figure 4.9, cheap -riders (M: 4.68; SD: 1.14) and cooperators having derived similar levels ( p >.10) of Emotional Warm -Glow from their respective repayment decisions. Free -riders (M: 3.80; SD: 1.00), on the other hand, were understandably more reluctant than cooperators ( p <.01) to cite experienced warm -glow as why they decided to take full advantage of the situation. Table 4.11. Spearman's Correlation of Factor Scores by Repayment Cheap Glow * Retaliation 0.432 -0.118 0.510 Experienced Warm - Glow * Justice Pursuit 0.663*** 0.393 Retaliation * Justice above implied that cheap -riders tended to both think (i.e. to bring justice) and feel (i.e. warm -glow) similar to people who earnestly fulfilled their obligation (despite the unfair treatment). This was further evidenced (See Table 4.11) by the significant association (both ps <.01) between the factors 'Experienced Warm Glow' and 'Justice Pursuit' only among cheap -riders (rs = .63) and cooperators (rs = .66) but not the free-riders (rs = .393, p = .232). However, results of the cocor analysis ( Diedenhofen & Musch, 2015) indicated no significant differences among these three correlation indices. Figure 4.10. Factor Retaliation/ Punishment by Repayment Decisions ( N = 87) It is, meanwhile, untrue to claim that cheap - and free-riders have nothing in common. First, Figure 4.9 highlighted that they reported having acquired similar emotional warm -glow (p >.10) from their refusal to cooperate . Furthermore, as depicted in Figure 4.10 both cheap M: 2.27; SD: 1.19), to attribute a punitive intent to their repayment decisions. Taken together, both the present cheap - and free- riders were similarly ( p >. 10) motiva ted to exercise their 'rights' to sanction with a penali sing intent \u2014which was absent among those cooperators . In summary, the above analyses evidenced an emotional ambivalence among the present cheap -riders . They felt motivated, like the free-riders, to express their irritation with their helpers not acting in accord with the injunctive fairness norm (i.e. moral outrage , Batson et al., 2007; Batson, Chao, & Givens, 2009). Nonetheless, just like the cooperators they experienced an internal emoti onal satisfaction (Holmes, 2009; Ribar & Wilhelm, 2002) from their de facto 'voluntary' back -transfer. Additionally, these cheap -riders were pointing to the quest for distributive justice (Tyler, 1994) or provision of 'just deserts' (Carlsmith et al., 2002 ; Darley, 2001) \u2014like the cooperators \u2014as for why they ended up paying back partially . All in all, the present cheap -riders appeared to want to cultivate a 'firm but fair' persona (Komorita, Hilty, & Parks, 1991; Preston, 2013) by how they reacted against normative injustice . 4.3.3.3.

Particularly, I tested the Social -Cognitive Model of Gratitude ( i.e. Chapter 4 161 SCMG ; Wood et al., 2008 )\u2014which argued that dispositional gratitude will restrain under -repayment (i.e. cheap - and free-riding inclusive) via its serially mediated effect on state gratitude through benefit appraisal (See Figure 4.11). Thus, the following features the path analysis with PROCESS (Hayes, 2013) on the serial mediational model of dispositional gratitude over under -repayment rate (i.e. UR %). Table 4.12 and Figure 4.11 detail the statistics.

The results, as detailed in Table 4.12 and Figure 4.11, indicated that almost none of the present hypothesi sed paths were significant at p <.05. The bias - corrected, 5000 -sampled Bootstrap Confidence Intervals of the aggrega te indirect effect (i.e. a1d21b2 = -0.89*0.17*1.24 = -0.018) included zero (i.e. -1.08 to 0.60), suggesting non-significance . In a nutshell, the present data fails to confirm the indirect role of dispositional gratitude in restraining sanctioning as theorise d in the Social Cognitive Model of Gratitude (Wood et al., 2008). 4.3.4.

In short, gender had no role in differentiating eit her the recipients' ( N = 135) offer -invoked emotions, or the acceptors' ( N = 87) self -reported motives behind their repayment decisions.

The data showed no evidence ( p = .66) that a particular gender was more inclined to take what was offered to them. While the results highlighted a significant intera ction (2 (2) = 8.86, p =.012) between repayment (i.e. cheap - vs. free-ride vs. cooperate ) and gender, this interaction vanished ( p =.23) once the effect was re - analysed when cheap - and free-riders were re -grouped as 'defaulters'. Such a re-categorisation was needed because of a few small (i.e. below 5) cell counts (e.g. N= 2 for male cheap -riders, N= 4 for female free -riders) in the initial 2 (Gender)*3 ( cheap - vs. free-ride vs. cooperate ) Chi -square test. Additionally, results of an independent -samples t-test indicated no evidence ( ( M: SD: 35.4, N = 51) acceptors had under -repaid differently. Taken together, the data fails to acknowledge any contamination by gender on either the current psychometric (i.e. the ratings) or behavioural (e.g. repayment) measures. 4.3.4.2.

Results of the correlational analyses revealed that SDR \u2014which was operationalized by Paulhus's (1991) Impression Management Scale \u2014 were not correlated to any of the participants' pre- (i.e. Table 4.16, all ps >. 10) and post- repayment ratings (i.e. Table 4.17, all ps >. 10). Hence, how recipients ( N = 135) reported feeling towards the offers, and the way acceptors ( N = 87) justified their repayment decisions both appeared not biased by SDR. Table 4.1 8.

Meanwhile, correlational analyses revealed a negative a ssociation between under -repayment rates and SDR (i.e. the IMS composite), rs (85) = -0.22, p = .046 (two -tailed), hinting that acceptors who were more concerned about their social impressions would be more reluctant to sanction 'at full throttle'. Nonethe less, this correlation vanished when I confined the analyses to only defaulters (i.e. cheap - and free- riders inclusive, rs (26) = -0.26, p = .19) or just the cheap -riders , rs (15) = -0.07, p = .78. All in all, the data indicated minimal signs that participants' crucial decisions at present were bothered by Social Desirability Responding. 4.4. Discussion 4.4.1. Does more unfairness matter? Chapter 4 165 Chapter 3 (i.e. Experiment 1) underlined the role of normative fairness in guiding fairness perception, which then contributes to recipients' emotions (gratitude in particular) and ultimately a desire to directly reciprocate (Ma et al., 2014). Particularly, Experiment 1 showed that recipients could infer reputations (i.e. whether their helpers were fair people) \u2014under the guidance of the injunctive norm \u2014based on whether or not the help they received was conditional . Crucially, while Chapter 3 indicated an unambiguous divide between perceptions of an unfair versus a fair offer \u2014which was evidenced by the m ediational model (refer to Figure 3.5), it remains unaddressed how people may differentially perceive offers of varying unfairness . That is, knowing that people would take issue with an unfair \u2014relative to a fair\u2014 offer, I endeavoured to examine if a more o utrageously unfair offer would irk them even further. Or alternatively, there exists a 'fairness -versus -unfairness' threshold and once that was passed, it mattered no more as in how egregious that infringement of fairness became (in comparison to other sce narios). Indeed, data of Experiment 2 appeared to endorse this 'fairness threshold' perspective. Echoing the observations from Experiment 1, the current manipulation of the degree of unfairness had practically no effect on all the outcome measures (e.g. of fer-invoked emotions, offer acceptances and repayment). Taken together, Experiments 1 and 2 may in combination suggested that (injunctive) fairness perception could belong to an 'all -or- nothing' concept: once the border of injunctive fairness had been over stepped people will just pay no mind to the 'severity' of that infringement. 4.4.2. Gratitude , Indebtedness and Sanctioning in Economic Games Chapter 4 166 Overall, the results showed little evidence that gratitude (as a state and a disposition ) and indebtedness were related to the participants' reciprocal or sanctioning decisions (i.e. repayment). This again echoed the results in Experiment 1 whereby recipients' various affective states (e.g. gratitude , indebtedness etc.)\u2014triggered by the conditional offer recei pts (N = 21) \u2014were also not predictive of how they actually repaid their helpers (See Chapter 3). Figure 4.12. Understanding Check Example Screens (Experiment 1) Figure 4.13 Understanding Check Example Screens (Experiment 2) While it may be convenient to point the finger at the power issue for the absence of expected findings (especially for Experiment 1), another reason could lie in a shared experimental feature of Experiments 1 and 2 \u2014i.e. the recipients' implicit assumption of the binding nature of the repayment conditions before they decided whether to accept. Recipients only came to know of the feasibility of not honouring their repayment after they indicated Chapter 4 167 acceptances. This, in conjunction with the understanding checks w hich explicitly highlighted the advantages of acceptances despite the full repayment (See Figures 4.12 and 4.13 above), could have ruled out any thoughts to possibly under -repay when recipients decided whether to accept the offers. As a result, those who w ere bothered by the injunctive unfairness may have already severed the tie with the helper before even getting to know they could punish. In fact, the evidence of people shunning a financial benefit amidst perceived injustice has been well documented in th e Impunity Game literature (e.g. Ma et al., 2012; Takagishi et al., 2009; Yamagishi et al., 2012). Thus it is not unreasonable to speculate that those who remained in the loop (by accepting) were at least not taking so much issue with their (in principle) unfair offers. Indeed, the present findings which highlighted how differently acceptors and rejectors felt about the offers certainly give substances to this speculation (See Sub-section 4.3.2.1). In particular, the data (i.e. Table 4.4) showed that reject ors felt less grateful , indebted , and gave a less favourable appraisal, toward the offers. They also deemed the exchange less reasonable and felt less likely to reciprocate . All these resonated with a speculation that the current participants, who were not aware of the non-binding nature of the condition a priori, may have indeed used their acceptance decision as a proxy sanction (or reward) in response to their helpers' gestures. Consequently, the repayment may be inflated because those who were discontented with the arrangement, thus more prone to sanction, may have been 'filtered' from the repayment analyses. While logically sound, neither Experiments 1 nor 2 had examined the psy chology of the rejectors. Therefore, it Chapter 4 168 still remains to be seen whether the above does explain why neither gratitude nor indebtedness was shown to relate to repayment in Experiments 1 and 2. 4.4.3. Disambiguating Cheap -, Free -riders and Cooperators As a c ontinuation of Experiment 1, one key objective of the present experiment entails finding out why people cheap -ride on someone. The results of the Principal Axis Analysis identified three factors of why (or why not) they repaid an injunctively unfair offer even when not doing so yielded no repercussions. Those included, a) Experienced Warm -glow (Ferguson & Flynn, 2016); b) Justice Pursuit; and c) Retaliation/ Punitive Responses. Importantly, the follow -up analysis of these three factor scores \u2014on the basis of repayment decisions \u2014offered insights upon the unique mentality that underlies cheap -riding. On one hand, cheap -riders would fancy some paybacks , just like their free -riding counterparts, out of the irritation at helpers' departure from a moral standard in injunctive fairness (Batson et al., 2007; Batson et al., 2009; Wakslak et al., 2007). On the other, cheap -riding constituted more than just a channel for venting out frustrations (Legkaukas & Jakimaviit, 2007). Cheap -riders were as convinced as the coo perators that their partial repayment would promote distributive justice (Tyler, 1994), and meanwhile provided what they believed were the fair shares to their helpers (Santos & Rivera, 2015; Weinstein, 2011; Wenzel & Thielmann, 2006) . Furthermore, cheap -riders also derived a sense of emotional satisfaction (Beccheti & Degli Antoni, 2010; Falk, 2007; Harbaugh, 1998) from their de facto 'voluntary' repayment gesture, as did acceptors who earnestly fulfilled their prior agreement. All in all, the prese nt cheap -riders appeared to capture the gist of the theory of 'Just Deserts' in sanctioning (Carlsmith et al., 2002; Darley et al., Chapter 4 169 2000; Starkweather, 1992). Instead of being fixated on vengeance, a 'just' punishment entails giving the offenders a rightfu l, deserving comeuppance (Moore, 1997) that serves to restore the overall moral balance (Wenzel & Thielmann, 2006). This clearly echoes the present cheap -riders' pattern of responses toward the post -repayment survey as outlined above. 4.4.4. Cheap -riding i n Real -life Settings: Under -contribution of Child Support Indeed, I argue that one fitting example that epitomi ses cheap -riding in a real -life setting will be the under -contribution of child support in the United Kingdom (See Allbeson, 201 6; Savage, 2015 ). According to the Child Support Act 1991, a ' non-resident parent' (i.e. the parent who is not involved in the main day -to-day child care ) is obliged to financially provide for his/her ex - partner (i.e. the ' receiving parent') in regards their children's dai ly living expenditure. This amount of contribution is computed after taking into consideration a basket of factors in relation to the non -resident parent's socio - economic status (e.g. weekly income, whether he/she is on a benefit etc.). Meanwhile, data fro m the Child Support Agency (CSA hereafter) suggested that as of September 2014 there is a total of 'uncollectible' child maintenance which amounts to \u00a32,917 million, with over a quarter of the non - resident parents contributing less than half of their oblig ated amount (See Savage, 2015). A closer look at the data revealed that there were 17.2% of paying parents paying a non -zero but below 80% of the stipulated contribution. I interpret this 17.2% of under -contribution as a quintessence of cheap - riding as pre sently operationalized (i.e. a partial repayment of an affordable, conditional offer). As explained above this contribution is supposedly tailored each non -resident parent's earning power, thereby rendering him/her no Chapter 4 170 grounds to quote affordability as a re ason to not pay up. However, the CSA's notoriety in its failure to retrieve the maintenance arrears has been so flagrant that even Mary Quinn, the Head of the CSA in Northern Ireland, once had to publicly apologi se for it (See Savage, 2007). Hence, there i s no reason to not expect that these non -resident parents should have known of the de facto absence of repercussions even if they refuse to contribute in full . In other words, resembling the conditional offer acceptors in Experiments 1 and 2, these non -resident parents should know that if they wanted to they could have not contributed anything and practically faced no consequences (although in principle they would still risk imprisonment or forced sales of properties). Nevertheless, the fact th at this particular portion of non-resident parents was contributing something clearly captures the essence of cheap -riding , that is, to piggyback on others' high contribution (i.e. former partners' effort and financial expenditure in child -raising) by givi ng just the bare minimum (See Bchir & Willinger, 2013; Isaac et al., 1989; Marks et al., 2006). Interestingly, the present proportion of cheap -riding (i.e. 17/87= 19.5%) was not too far off from the abovementioned figure from the CSA (i.e. 17.2%) that was calculated based on a total sample of 86,700. Thus I believe this not only emphasi ses that the present analysis of cheap -riding is not without ecological validity (Brewer, 2000; Shadish , Cook, & Campbell, 2002), but also enables the extrapolation of certain crucial findings into the understanding of the child support evasion situation that is discussed in Section 4.5.1 below. 4.5 Implications of Chapter 4 While Section 4.4 summari sed and discussed \u2014from a theoreti cal standpoint \u2014several key features of the present analyses, this section would Chapter 4 171 highlight two important implications. They included, first, how the analyses of cheap -riders add to the understanding of child support under -contributions (i.e. Sub-section 4.5.1), and second, a few methodological concerns (of both Experiments 1 and 2) which constitute four unanswered questions (i.e. UAQs 1 to 4) that warrant future investigation s (i.e. Sub -sections 4.5.2.1 to 4.5.2.4). 4.5.1. Cheap -riders and Under -Contributing Non -resident Parents One crucial discovery of the present analyses, as discussed in Sub- section 4.4.3, entails the profiling of the cheap -riders' emotional ambivalence behind their partial back -transfers. It is conceivable that such an emotional ambivalence may also underlie why certain non -resident parents would under - contribute their shares of child support. On one hand, just like the present cheap -riders these parents m ay under -repay to show retributions against their exes for the separation and/or the loss of custody (Hetherington & Stanley - Hagan, 1999; Stahly, 2000 ). But on the other, leaving the entire burden of child -raising to the exes may have crossed the line of w hat a 'Just Desert' should constitute (Darley et al., 2000; Moore, & Thielmann, 2006) \u2014especially if that ex -partner far from well -off (See 'A Single Parent's Story' in Savage (2015)). Furthermore, the fact that one contributes, albeit inco mpletely, could also help lessen that non -custodial parent's guilt over the deprivation of his/her children of a loving family ( Arditti, 1992; Braver et al., 1993; Seagull & Seagull, 1977 )\u2014and that guilt aversion is a defining attribute of 'experienced war m-glow' (Ferguson & Flynn, 2016). All in all, the above implied that all three present extracted factors \u2014 namely, Experienced Warm -Glow, Justice Pursuit and Retaliation/ Punitive Responses \u2014appears to each have a role in egging those non -resident parents on Chapter 4 172 underpaying their shares. Nonetheless, while the above described how the current analyses may account for why a non -resident parent would contribute insufficiently, it is still arbitrary to make a case that these are the genuine reasons behind. There could still a wh ole lot of other reasons behind why people would under -contribute their child support. For instance, a non -resident father may have doubt about the paternity of that child he legally 'shares' with his ex -partner (See O'Connor, Kelleher, & Kelleher, 2008), thus not paying the support in full (with the understanding that not doing so will not practically bring forth any repercussions) may represent some forms of self -protections. Taken together, qualitative analyses such as Grounded Theory or case study will be warranted if one endeavours to specifically address the psychology of those non -custodial parents (e.g. Cook, McKenzie, & Natalier, 2015; Klett - Davies , 2016; Skinner, 2013; Wilson, 2006). 4.5.2. Unanswered Questions (i.e. UAQs) that warrant further re search Below (i.e. Subsections 4.5.2.1 to 4.5.2.4) I outline several UAQs (i.e. UAQs 1 to 4) that warrant further empirical scrutiny. These UAQs primarily concern the methodological features of both Experiments 1 and 2. 4.5.2.1 UAQ #1: Does 'more fairnes s' really there really a 'threshold' for fairness perception? Overall, results of Experiment 2 in combination with Experiment 1 hinted the existence of a threshold in fairness evaluation. Recipients whose helpers had infringed normative fair ness seemed not differentially offended by the relative severity of that violation. While such an absolute construal of a 'fairness -unfairness' divide has been documented in the literature (Bian & Keller, 1999; Eckel & Grossman, Chapter 4 173 1996b), Wood and colleague s (2011) contended that relativity matters as people are sensitive to how their treatment compare against what others were having (i.e. the 'Gratitude Relativity Hypothesis (i.e. GRH hereafter)). Thus, the GRH would challenge this absolute perspective of f airness judgment, as it should predict less discontent with (and more gratitude toward) helpers who gave a less unreasonable offer (e.g. an ' Interest -Free ' compared to a ' 50%-interest' offer). In other words, more unfairness should 'count' according to the GRH. Nevertheless, the lack of transparency as regards helpers' behavioural options (and also what other recipients were getting) in Experiments 1 and 2 prevented the scru tiny of GRH. While the rationale of such information denial has been detailed in Chapter 3, it remains intriguing to test whether this 'fairness -threshold' perspective would prevail in a context in which recipients could infer helpers' intent based on both their actual and their ' could -have - chosen ' options (Charness & Levine, 2007). That is, whether the fairness - threshold perspective or the GRH would better portray a recipient's in -game fairness perception should be the focus of a relevant future scrutiny. 4.5.2.2 UAQ #2: Were the lack of opportunities to play both in -game roles to blame for the observed 'over -cooperativeness' in Experiments 1 and 2? While Experiments 1 and 2 had each recorded a certain extent of cynicism \u2014for instance, the lack of helping ( i.e. 19.7% in Experiment 1) and under -repayment (i.e. 38 % and 32% defaulting rate in Experiments 1 and 2 respectively), it is undeniable that a majority of the participants were not behaving as a quintessential profit -maximizer. Discussions on why partici pants in Experiments 1 and 2 appeared too prosocial would be detailed in Chapter 5. Chapter 4 174 Indeed, I suspected that a reason behind the relative lack of cynicism in both experiments may be attributed to the fact that both games were single -role games. Participan ts in Experiments 1 and 2 were only assigned to one in -game role. Burks, Carpenter, and Verhoogen (2003) argued that such a single -role design may, relative to a design where players would assume different roles (i.e. both trustors and trustees) in differe nt trials, have inflated participants' in - game prosociality. Burks et al. (2003) attributed this increased prosociality in a single -role game to participants feeling more personally responsible for their co-player's ultimate payoffs (i.e. the ' Reduced Resp onsibility Hypothesis'). Thus they might be more uncomfortable acting in accord with their self -interest knowing that their acts were the only determinant of their partners' poor payoffs. Taken together, Experiments 1 and 2 had definitely left the door ope n for future scrutiny as of whether the single -role design was the reason for the observed patterns of over -generous decision making. 4.5.2.3 UAQ #3: Why reject an offer in the present experimental set -up? One intriguing observation of the present study no doubt entails the almost threefold increase in rejection (35.6%) compared to that of Experiment 1 (conditional offer rejection: 3/24: 12.5%). While the above (i.e. Sub -section 4.4.2) alluded to the possibility of participants rejecting out of a retaliat ory intent against injustice (Takagishi et al., 2009; Yamagishi et al., 2009), the psychology of rejectors in this scenario was still yet to be ascertained. Particularly, dispositional indebtedness (Mathews & Green, 2010; Mathews & Shook, 2013) may also c onstitute a strong correlate of people's decision to shun a financially advantageous arrangement. As detailed in Chapter 1 dispositionally indebted people are best characterised by their Chapter 4 175 extreme endeavours to avoid owing anybody anything (Greenberg & Westc ott, 1983), thanks to their religious adherence to the reciprocity norm (Gouldner, 1960). It is, therefore, conceivable the high rejections may be attributable to individual differences along the continuum of dispositional indebtedness. However, neither of the two experiments, as presently constructed, could disentangle two above -mentioned motives of rejections. Therefore, to better examine the role of dispositional indebtedness in fostering rejection I suggest amending another shared feature of Experimen ts 1 and 2: recipients' pre-acceptance unawareness of the non-binding nature of the repayment. By removing this unawareness a true punisher should instead accept the offer and then default, considering that rejection is no longer the most effective puniti ve strategy. In contrast, a dispositionally indebted person should always reject to avoid building up credits with others (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983). 4.5.2.4 UAQ #4: Cheap -riding as a fairness enforcement strategy? Lastly, I argued that cheap -riding could function in a similar fashion as altruistic punishment (Boyd et al., 2003; Fehr et al., 2002; Fehr & G \u00e4chter , 2002; Fowler, 2005). That is, by deliberately under -repaying a cheap -rider endeavours to curb any future ungenerous acts from that helper (Ma et al., 2014). Nonetheless, it remains unexamined as of how valid this logic is, and how efficacious cheap -riding is as a strategy to be relied upon in implementing normative fairness. Therefore, a future re levant study should constitute a direct manipulation of cheap -riding that permits the scrutiny of the effect of being 'cheap -rode' over that 'victim's' propensity to play fair consequently. Chapter 4 176 Chapter 5 176 Chapter 5 Gratefully Received, Gratefully Retaliate? Analysing the Role of Emotion and Situational variables in Repeated Economic Exchanges (Experiment 3) Chapter 5 177 5.0. Overview of Chapter 5 In Experiment 1 I highlighted how normative fairness guides fairness perception, especially in situations where information about others' intent was absent , and how this perception would mould one's emotional gratitude and a desire to cooperate. Among those ill-treated ( normatively speaking ) participants a non-negligible portion of them retaliated in the form of cheap -riding . Experiment 2 , meanwhile, offered a more in -depth analysis of cheap - riding . The data revealed a pattern of cheap -riding that shared resemblance not only to observations in Experiment 1, but also to the reality (i.e. non -resident parents under -contributing their child support). I also disentangle d the psychology of cheap -riders from cooperators and that of typical maximizer s. While Experiments 1 and 2 in combination constituted a decent measure of how state or trait gratitude, aside from factors such as normative fairness or Just Deserts (Carlsmith et al. 2002; Darley, 2001) , shapes people's prosociality in economic exchan ges, Chapter 4 outlined certain issues that warrant attention. They were , a) recipients' lack of access to 'what my helper could have done instead of what he/she did' ; b) the 'over -generosity' issue , and c) recipients' unawareness of feasibility to default and the ir high rates of offer rejections. As such, t he primary objective of Experiment 3 was to address a few unanswered questions (i.e. UAQs hereafter) in Chapter s 3 and 4 by incorporating new design features. The below summari ses, in bulletin points, the four crucial UAQs and how the five new features could help address them . - UAQ 1: Is there really an 'all -or-nothing' threshold for injunctive fairness? - Design Feature 1 : Recipients in this game were no longer blind to the help ing options available to each helper . Such an awareness should enable recipients to Chapter 5 178 deduce the injunctive fairness by comparing what they actually to what they could have received. Hence t his would allow the scrutiny of whether the observed 'all -or-nothing' pattern of injunctive fairness attribution in Experiments 1 and 2 is moderated by recipients' knowledge . That is, now that recipients knew how they could have been treated differently, would a more unfair (e.g. a '50% -Interest') offer still prompt a similar appraisal (e.g. intent, gratitude etc.) than when they were given a fairer (e.g. 'Interest -free') one? - UAQ 2: Were participants in Experiments 1 and 2 too cooperative due to the lack of opportunities to assume both in-game roles (i.e. helpers and recipients)? - Design Feature 2 : I argued that the one-shot nature and specifically, the lack of chances to play both as helpers and recipients may explain the lack of cynicism in either experiment (i.e. over 80% helping in Experiment 1 and over 60% full repayment in both Experiments). Indeed, Burks, Carpenter and Verhoogen (2003) theorise d that playing both roles may lead players to feel less responsibility for others' payoffs thus remove their guilt over selfish decisions (i.e. the Reduced Responsibility Hypothesis ). Thus, by having participants play an iterated, two-role version of the game I examined whether a different pattern of helping and repayment (than Experiments 1 and 2) would be observed. - UAQ 3: Were rejections in Experiment 2 down to injustice or indebtedness ? - Design Feature 3 : It remains unclear if the high rate of rejection (i.e. 35.6%) of cond itional offers was down to recipients' disapproval of perceived injustice, or a trait indebtedness -induced repulsion against benefit acceptance (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983). I argued that this confusion could originate from Experiment 2's design where players had no awareness of the feasibility of repayment evasion. As such, in Experiment 3 I informed participants of th is Chapter 5 179 feasibility before the acceptance or rejection decision s. While this new feature may not tamper with the indebtedness -motivated rejections, I would expect minimal rejection s out of perceived unfairness as there is clearly a more effective strategy to retaliate: to simply take the offers and then not repay. - UAQ 4: Does being 'cheap -rode' prompt more eventual fair plays? - Design Feature 4 and 5 : I argued the logic behind cheap -riding should be similar to that of altruistic punishment (Fehr & G \u00e4chter, 2002; Fowler, 2005) . That is, via their reduced payback che ap-riders endeavoured to prevent future non-generosity of their helpers (Ma et al., 2014) . To examine the validity of this argument I included two additional features as summari sed below: First, I manipulated the magnitude of partners' repayment for partic ipants who helped conditionally in the first trial ( in which they played as a potential helper). A conditional offer in Trial 1, depending on a one's assigned condition, may be partially repaid (i.e. Cheap -riding condition), fully repaid (i.e. Fairness condition') or utterly not repaid (i.e. Free -riding condition). Second, participants played as a helper twice (i.e. Helper Trials, HTs hereafter) and eight times as a recipient (i.e. Recipient Trials, RTs hereafter), while the 8 RTs were sandwiched by the 2HTs (i.e. Trial 1 and Trial 10) . During the 8 RTs participants received offers of varying conditionalities (to be discussed later) . Overall, features 4 and 5 should permit the analysis of whether being 'cheap - rode' would push people to act more in accord with injunctive fairness. That is , whether the conditional helpers (on Trial 1) from the Cheap -riding condition would be more inclined to show generosity in the ensuing experimental trials . 5.1. Introduction 5.1.1. The Purpose of Experiment 3 Chapter 5 180 The key objective of Experiment 3 was to address a few unexamined issues in Experiments 1 and 2 , and in so doing I intended to complement the robustness of the overall investigation of gratitude -induced prosociality . I aimed also to further th e understanding of the gratitude -(direct) reciprocity relation \u2014 which was a key discovery in Chapter 2 \u2014by examining what other variables (situational or dispositional) could have contributed to the strength of this link. The next section (i.e. Section 5.1.2 ) discusses how the new features of the current experiment could address the UAQs as outlined in Section 5.0. 5.1.2. Unanswered Questions from Experiments 1 and 2 In this section I discuss at length a series of UAQs from Experiments 1 and 2, and importantl y, I elaborate on how the new features could help tackle these UAQs. While this section may touch upon a few present predictions and hypotheses, they are to be thoroughly discussed in Section 5.1.3. 5.1.2.1. UAQ 1: Does the degree of unfairness really not count? One intriguing observation of Experiments 1 and 2 was that participants whose helpers breached the injunctive fairness norm (i.e. via giving conditional offers with varying repayment expectations) seemed not bothered by the extent of their helpers' non-generosity. Meanwhile, data of Experiment 1 illustrates that people favoured unconditional (injunctively fair) over conditional (injunctively not fair) offers ( e.g. more perceived helpfulness and state gratitude) . In sum , data from Experiments 1 and 2 imply that individuals care only about whether injunctive fairness was observed, and crucially when it was not a more (or less) severe deviation from fairness would not matter. The above hinted that there may be a 'threshold' to segregate fairness from unfairness (in a normative sense). Nonetheless, a shared feature of Chapter 5 181 Experiments 1 and 2 (i.e. recipients' naivety about the helpers' available options ) may render this fairness threshold perspective debatable . In particular, it remains unaddressed as in ho w differently would recipients respond if they could decipher their helpers' intent based on both the helpers' selected and neglected options (Charness & Levine, 2007)? Hence , one key new feature of Experiment 3 would be the recipients' awareness of the he lpers' list of options . In the present study participants played an iterated game in which they had opportunities \u2014at different trials \u2014to assume the role as a helper or a recipient. Participants played as a potential helper (i.e. P1s hereafter) in Trial 1 and 10 and as a potential recipient (i.e. P2s hereafter) for the eight trials in between. The trials were arranged this way to notify the participants, prior to playing as P2s , of the various behavioural options a P1 will be endowed with. Via this revised experimental set -up I measured whether the transparency of P1s' options would affect participants' offer appraisals and behavioural decisions during the Recipient Trials. Specifically, I assessed whether the well -informed recipients in this game would replicate the 'all-or- nothing ' pattern of fairness perceptions as indicated in Experiments 1 and 2. As such , I tested two competing hypotheses. The Gratitude Relativity Hypothesis (i.e. GRH) (Wood, Maltby & Brown, 2011) \u2014which predicts a graded offer appraisa l (i.e. how an offer is appraised is subject to its relative worth to other offers), and the Inelastic Fairness Construal (i.e. IFC) notion \u2014 which argues the fairness threshold perspective as mentioned above (i.e. how fair an offer is only hinges on whether it is consistent with the injunctive norm). Section 5.1.3 features a detailed discussion in relation to GRH and IFC . Chapter 5 182 5.1.2.2. UAQ 2: Was the lack of both perspectives as helpers and recipients to blame for the observed over -cooperativeness in b oth Experiments 1 and 2? Another issue surrounding Experiments 1 and 2 was that participants seemed to be too cooperative . Below I discuss why I came to this conclusion and how the current revised design may subject that to scrutiny. a) How were participan ts in Experiments 1 and 2 'overly cooperative'? While I addressed the moral rationale of P1s in Experiment 1 to not only help but also help unconditionally (Elster, 200 6), the fact that one was willing to entrust something to an anonymous , one-time fellow co-player (even with expectations to be repaid) alone already constitutes a prosocial gesture ( Berg et al., 1995 ; Fehr & Rockenbach, 2003). Gergen and colleagues (Gergen, Diebold, Seipel, & Gresser, 1969; Gergen et al., 1975) even argued that gifting uncon ditional benefits in economic games may engender suspicion as recipients may ponder why the helpers were being that benevolent. Considering also that the one -shot, double -blinded design of Experiment 1 should have removed any reputation -incentivized helping (G\u00fcney & Newell, 2013), the observed 80% helping rate (and with the majority being unconditional helping , i.e. 51% ) should evidence an over -generosity issue among helpers in Experiment 1 . Meanwhile, the meta -analysis by Johnson and Mislin (2011) ov er 160 Trust Games revealed an average trustworthiness index (i.e. TI hereafter) of 37%. This TI was the ratio of a trustee's actual back -transfer to the highest possible back -transfer. Indeed, the TIs of both Experiments 1 and 2 (i.e. Experiment 1 ( N = 21): M: 37.2), which were above the mean estimates (i.e. 37%) by some distances , were not far off from the maximum TI (i.e. 81.2%) in Johnson and Mislin's Chapter 5 183 (2011) review. In this regard , it should not be unreasonable to argue that participants in Experiments 1 and 2 were overly trustworthy. b) Single -role vs. Two -role Games: Analysing why people over -cooperate? I suggested that the one -shot, single -role design of Experiments 1 and 2 may account for w hy people seemed to be overly prosocial in either study. In particular, Burks et al. (2003) put forth two hypotheses on how playing both roles (as senders and receivers) could contribute to participants' in -game prosociality. The Reduced Responsibility Hypothesis (i.e. RRH) \u2014which argues that playing both roles reduces the players' helping and reciprocating intentions, and the Golden Rules Hypothesis (i.e. GRH) \u2014which argues the otherwise. See Section 5.1.3.2 for more details about RRH and GRH. As such, the present revised design should help tackle UAQ 2 by testing the RRH and the GRH. In particular, I examined whether a similar pattern of over-helping or over-repayment would still be found in a context where players could garner perspectives of both helpers and recipients . 5.1.2.3. UAQ 3: Was negative reciprocity or trait indebtedness to blame for rejecting a financially advantageous, albeit injunctively unfair, offer? I discussed that the lack of prior knowledge on one's 'defaulting' rights (in both Experiments 1 and 2) may account for the high rejection rate (i.e. 36%) of offers in Experiment 2. Evidence in the impunity game (IG) literature has documented the feasibility of players irrationally rejecting a financial benefit out of preservatio n of social fairness (e.g. Yamagishi et al., 2009; Yamagishi et al., 2012). Hence, in Chapter 4 I speculated that participants may have utilised their 'acceptance/rejection' options to retaliate against the helpers' belittlement of injunctive fairness, ins tead of their repayment options as originally expected. Chapter 5 184 Nonetheless, I also argued that trait indebtedness ( Mathews & Green, 2010 ; Mathews & Shook, 2013 ) may be an alternative reason why people quitted on a financial benefit. A dispositionally indebted person is characterised by an ever -present disgust to be the one to receive in an exchange ( Greenberg & Westcott, 1983 ). Thus, such an indebtedness -driven rejection should not relate to endeavours to protest against injustice. However, in Experiment 2 the re was no way to rule out either of the motives behind the observed rejections. Therefore, t o unravel this confusion I brought in another modification in Experiment 3 . Instead of keeping recipients in the dark they were informed, before they accepted (or rejected) the offers , that the acceptors had the freedom to, later on, decide whether or not and how much to repay . This new feature should enable the disentanglement of the two abovementioned motives behind the rejections . Obviously, knowing that the 'default' option is now open a punisher is expected to accept and later on default. In contrast, dispositionally indebted participants should still reject nonetheless as they always strive to refrain from owing anybody (Greenberg & Westcot t, 1983). 5.1.2.4. UAQ 4: Does being 'cheap -rode' make the 'victims' act more fairly? Throughout the thesis I contended that the logic to cheap -ride in an economic game could be analogous to that of altruistic punishment (Fehr & G\u00e4chter, 2002) . That is, by incurring a cost (i.e. making a partial repayment despite not having to ) the cheap -riders strive to prevent their miserly helpers from 'victimising' other people in the future. Nonetheless, it remains to be seen how valid this notion is, and even if cheap -riding is resorted to how effective it is in enforcing fairness . Thus here I examined whether being 'cheap -rode' would prompt more eventual fair (or generous) gestures from the 'victims' . Chapter 5 185 In Experiment 3 I manipulated partners' repayment a mong players who made conditional offers in Trial 1 where they played as P1s. Thus , by having different conditional givers experience different levels of partners' repayment (i.e. cooperating, cheap - or free -riding) I examined specifically whether (and how) being cheap -rode (compared to other treatments) would succeed in inciting more generous decisions in the ensuing trials (i.e. Trial 2 to 10) . 5.1.3. Exploratory Aims and Hypotheses In this section , I present the list of hypotheses and explorator y aims of the current chapter and the respective predictions were summari sed in Table 5.1. I intend to discuss at length the procedures of the current experimental design in section 5.2 (i.e. the Method section). 5.1.3.1. Inelastic Fairness Construal vs . Gratitude Relativity Hypothesis I addressed , in Section 5.1.2.1, how granting participants the perspectives of both helpers and recipients should facilitate the analyses of whether injunctive fairness is an absolute or a relative judgment (i.e. 'whether more unfairness really does not count ( i.e. UAQ 1)'. There were two hypotheses making competing predictions on the matter, and they were , a) the Inelastic Fairness Construal argument and, b) the Gratitude Relativity Hypothesis (Woo d et al., 2011). Both hypotheses are discussed below. i) Inelastic Fairness Construal Argument Eckel and Grossman (1996 b) introduced the concept of fairness elasticity in the context of economic games. In particular, they contended that an inelastic fairn ess demand, as characterised by the consistent sanctioning against unfair treatment despite the increasing cost of doing so , should originate Chapter 5 186 from the punisher's stubborn allegiance to a set of moral principles (Gilligan, 1982) like the injunctive norm s (Biel, Von Borgstede , & Dahlstrand, 1999). The above fairness perspective hinted that the crucial criterion for fairness perception lies in the injunctive norm . That is , whether a treatment was fair should hinge on how that specific treatment compares to normative fairness . Thus , relativity should be irrelevant as people would focus on how a specific treatment fares against the 'standard' fair treatment, but not against other treatments. Indeed, such an inelastic (or absolute) fairness construal is documented in the literature (Bian & Keller, 1999; Eckel & Grossman, 1996 b). Building upon this inelastic fairness construal (IFC) notion, the information of whether a helper could be nicer (or nastier) should have no role in offer appraisals. Recipients are expected to evaluate, subject to the guidance of injunctive norm (Ma et al., 2014), whether the offer on its own constituted a fair (or an unfair ) gesture. As such , the IFC should predict an 'all -or-nothing' threshold in fairness attribution similar to Experiments 1 and 2. In other words , only a dichotomous 'fair vs. unfair' contrast in intent and emotions between receipts of unconditional and conditional (i.e. 'the interest -free', '25% -interest' and '50% -interest') offers should exist. The IFC would al so predict all conditional offer receipts, regardless of conditionalities, to trigger similar emotions and intent, considering that the imposition of repayment clauses alone already breached the injunctive fairness norm (Elster, 2006; Ma et al., 2014). ii) Gratitude Relativity Hypothesis (i.e. GRH hereafter ) (Wood et al., 2011) The GRH argues that the experience of gratitude does not function in an absolute manner . Relativity matters as people are vigilant to how their benefits 'rank' among what others have acquired . Accordingly, a person who is Chapter 5 187 convinced that his/her benefit does not compare favourably should barely experience any gratitude. Thus , the GRH implies that recipients seldom judge a benefit in isolation as recipients always contemplate its relati ve worth . Hence , the newfound transparency of helpers' options in the present study should facilitate the comparisons of offers that one actually received with what he/she could have received. This comparison should then elicit a graded, linear fairness appraisal of offers of varying conditionalities. For instance, knowing that a helper could have helped unconditionall y, a recipient should think even less highly of helpers giving 50% -interest offers than those 'interest - free' offer givers . There fore, the GRH would hypothesi se not only different intent attributions (and emotions) between receipts of conditional and unconditional offers, but also across receipts of conditional offers of varying repayment obligations (i.e. 'interest -free' v s. 25%-interest' vs . '50% interest'). 5.1.3.2. Playing Both Roles and Over -generosity I highlighted in Section 5.1.2.2 how the present repeated and two-role design allows scrutiny over the two competing hypotheses by Burks et al (2003). They were the Golden Rules Hypothesis and the Reduced Responsibility Hypothesis . Via the current analysis I examined whether the lack of opportunities to play both in -game roles (i.e. single -role game) was indeed the reason why people over -cooperated in Experiments 1 and 2 (i. e. UAQ 2). i) Golden Rules Hypothesis Burks et al. (2003) contended that the playing both roles could raise the salience of the Golden Rule (i.e. 'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you'). Therefore, playing both roles should raise trustfulness (i.e. willingness to give offers) and trustworthiness (i.e. reciprocity) from the Chapter 5 188 participants, as they would fancy the same to occur to them (Burks et al., 2003). In short, the G olden Rule Hypothesis should predict even more 'over -helping' and 'over -repayment' in the present experiment than in Experiments 1 and 2 . ii) Reduced Responsibility Hypothesis Burks and colleague (2003), nonetheless, also theorise d that playing both roles may undermine prosociality, especially when the game involves partner -switching and independent trials. Burks et al. (2003) argued that playing both roles under such a setting may diminish prosociality because of a decreased sense of personal responsibility for partner's earning in e ach trial. As a result, participants may feel less uncomfortable making selfish decisions. Participants at present were told they each had a different 'partner' in each trial, and that their final outcome depended on the performance on a randomly selected trial. Therefore, the Reduced Responsibility Hypothesis should predict more selfish responding such as refusal to i) make any offers in the helper trials, or ii) fulfil the repayment obligations, in the present experiment than in Experiments 1 and 2. 5.1.3 .3. Cheap -riding as Normative Fairness Enforcement ? The present manipulation of 'partners' repayment' (i.e. partial, full or zero repayment) permits the scrutiny of the feasibility of cheap -riding in enforcing normative fairness. Thus, this norm -enforcemen t hypothesis (i.e. NEH hereafter) would predict that being cheap -rode should incite more generosity from the victims as they make amends for their initial violation of normative fairness (i.e. not helping for 'free' in Trial 1) (Ma et al., 2014). As such, the NEH should predict that relative to conditional helpers (of Trial 1) whose offers were fully repaid or utterly not repaid, helpers whose Chapter 5 189 recipients partially repaid (i.e. Cheap -riding Condition) should demonstrate more fair plays in subsequent trials such as helping unconditionally in Trial 10. The null hypothesis, nevertheless, would state that being 'cheap -rode' have no specific role in fostering more fair g estures from the victims . 5.1.3.4. Recurring Research Themes In addition to the exploratory aims and hypotheses detailed above, this chapter also comprises the analyses of two recurring research themes of the thesis. In particular, this section highlights how Gratitude and Indebtedness , as a state or trait, would influence cooperation or sanctioning in Experiment 3. a) Recurring Research Theme 1: Gratitude and Decision Making Since the present thesis primarily concerns the scrutiny of how gratitude nurtures prosociality in economic exchanges, there is no reason to overlook how state or trait gratitude would relate to the range of cooperative (or retaliatory) decision -making (e.g. helping and repayment) in Experiment 3 . ai.) State Gratitude and Prosociality (or Antisociality) in Economic Games The Moral Barometer hypothesis (McCullough et al., 2001) suggests the logical fallacy in people feeling gratitude while harbouring intention s to harm the benefactors (See Chapter 1 for a detailed discussion) . The Moral Motive hypothesis (McCullough et al., 2001) also addressed the role of state gratitude in cultivating a desire to repay the benefactors. Taken together , both the above Moral Functional Hypotheses of Gratitude should dismiss any motives to default by any gr ateful recipients . Therefore, these two moral gratitude hypotheses should predict minimal state gratitude from recipients under - repaying (partially or completely) their conditional offers (See Table 5.1). aii.) Trait Gratitude and Prosociality (or Antisociality) in Economic Games Chapter 5 190 Furthermore, gratitude as a trait should also discourage retaliation in Experiment 3 . Particularly, the Social Cognitive Model of Gratitude (i.e., SCMG, Wood et al., 2008) outlined how trait gratitude could indirectly dictate state gratitude by altering recipients' appraisal of benefits (Wood et al., 2008), with state gratitude being theorise d to restrain antisociality towards the helpers (McCullough et al., 2001 ). Thus , by testing the below path model (See Figure 5.1) examined whether trait gratitude would also restrain defaulting (i.e. under - repayment) the way as theorise d by Wood et al. (2008). Figure 5.1. The SCMG ( Wood et al., 2008) Prediction on Defaulting b) Re curring Research Theme 2: Indebtedness and Decision Making This chapter also includes the analysis of how indebtedness, as a state or a trait, would impact up on participants' decision making in Experiment 3. bi.) State Indebtedness and Prosociality (or Antisociality) in Economic Games Indebtedness as an unpleasant state that results from a benefit receipt (Greenberg & Shapiro, 1971) should also have some bearing on participants' in-game decisions . Greenberg and Westcott (1983) suggested that a double - blinded experimental set-up constitutes the perfect breeding grounds for indebted recipients to adopt Cognitive Restructuring to manage his/her arousal. Given that i n Experiment 3 I retained the double -anonymity (Hoffman et al., 1994) feature, an emotionally indebted recipient may be tempted to berate their helpers' intent as to rid oneself of the indebtedness -invoked discomfort (Hatfield & Sprecher, 1983). Such a distorted intent attribution may consequently trigger retaliation (Falk & Fischbacher, 2006) in the form of cheap - or free-riding . Taken together, this Cognitive Restructuring Hypothesis Trait Gratitude (TG) Benefit Appraisal (BA) Affective Gratitude (Gs) Under - repayment % (UR %) Chapter 5 191 (i.e. CRH hereafter) of indebtedness (Greenberg and Westcott, 1983) should predict a positive , indirect effect of state indebtedness on participants' under - repayment (i.e. UR %) via ben efit appraisal (i.e. BA) (See Figure 5.2). Figure 5. 2. CRH's (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983) Prediction on Defaulting Nonetheless, Greenberg (1980) argued that reciprocity could also help relieve an indebted recipient of his/her arousal . Therefore, echoing the Negative State Relief Model (Cialdini al., 1987), an indebted recipient would strive to escape the psychological shackle (Greenberg & Shapiro, 1971) by giving back . Contrary to the CRH, this indebtedness -reciprocity notion would predict a negative association between state indebtedness and participants' UR %. Recipients feeling more indebted (toward the helpers) should have a higher propensity to want to and actuall y make restitutions in the present game. bii.)Trait Indebtedness and Prosociality (or Antisociality) in Economic Games Dispositionally indebted individuals derive utilities via putting (and keeping) other people in debt (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983), as they enjoy being under -benefited in an interaction (Hatfield & Sprecher, 1983). Thus , I expect ed a more dispositionally indebted participant to help unconditionally , since giving to a stranger (while stressing that there is no need to pay up ) should place the h elper in the most disadvantageous position . A dispositionally indebted person is also characterised by an extreme sensitivity to (the state of) owing and a rigid allegiance to the reciprocity principle (Greenberg & Westcott , 198 3). Therefore , I would anticipate acceptors who under -repaid (either completely or partially) their conditional offers to be less dispositionally indebted than the fully -repaying acceptors. State Indebtedness (Is) Benefit Appraisal (BA) Under -repayment % (UR %) Chapter 5 192 Table 5.1 . Unanswered Questions, Hypotheses and Predictions of Experiment 3 Unanswered Questions (UAQ) Hypotheses/ Exploratory Aims Predictions/ Expected Results 1. Does degree of unfairness really 'not count' as suggested in Experiments 1 and 2? Yes: Fairness Construal (IFC) (Eckel & Grossman, 1996 b) IFC: Differences in intent attributions (and emotions) only based on if the offer was Conditional (i.e. injunctively unfair) or Unconditional (i.e.injunctively fair) ; No: Gratitude Relativity Hypothesis (i.e. GRH) (Wood et al., 2011) GRH : Differences in intent perceptions, and emotions , across offer conditionalities (i.e. Unconditional vs. Interest -Free vs. 25%- vs 50%-Interest ). 2. Was the lack of chances to play both roles in Experiments 1 and 2 to blame for the 'over - generosity' issue? Yes: Golden Rule Hypothesis (Burks et al., 2003) No: Reduced Responsibility Hypothesis (Burks et al., 2003) Golden Rule Hypothesis : More cooperativeness (i.e. helping in both Helper Trials ; Reciprocity in Recipient Trials) in Experiment 3 than both Experiments 1 and 2 Reduced Responsibility Hypothesis : More selfish responding in Experiments 3 than Experiments 1 and 2 (i.e. less helping and reciprocity in both HTs and RTs) 3. Were rejections in Experiment 2 attributable to negative reciprocity or trait indebtedness? Negative Reciprocity -driven Rejections (Bolton, Katok, & Zwick, 1998 ) The percentage of Conditional offer rejections at present should be significantly lower than that of Experiment 2 (i.e. 35.6%) . Trait Indebtedness -driven Rejections (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983) Conditional offer Rejectors should score higher than acceptors in the Indebtedness Scales -Revised (i.e. IS -R) (Elster , Maleki, McLeod, & Watkins, 2005) 4. Does being 'cheap -rode' prompt more eventual fair plays from the 'victims'? 'Norm -Enforcement' Hypothesis ( i.e. NEH) (i.e. Cheap -riding performs a similar function as Altruistic Punishment) NEH : Conditional helpers (at Trial 1) from ' Cheap -riding' condition, compared to helpers from ' Fairness ' or ' Free -riding ' conditions, should show more generosity in the eventual trials (e.g. give unconditional or less unfair ) offers in Trial 10) (Recurring Research Theme 1) Does Gratitude (as a state or a disposition ) nurture cooperation in economic exchanges? State Gratitude: Moral Barometer and Moral Motive Hypotheses of Gratitude (McCullough et al., 2001) Both Moral Barometer and Motive Hypotheses: Conditional offer acceptors who repaid fully (i.e. Cooperators ) should report more state gratitude than recipients repaying partly (i.e. Cheap -riders ) or nothing at all (i.e. Free -riders ). Trait Gratitude: Social Cognitive Model of Gratitude (SCMG) (Wood, et al., 2008) SCMG : Trait Gratitude should restra in defaulting (i.e. partial or zero repayment s of conditional offers) via Benefit Appraisal and Emotional Gratitude ( See Figure 5.1) (Recurring Research Theme 2) Does Indebtedness (as a state or as a trait) prompt cooperative or retaliatory economic State Indebtedness: 1. Cognitive -Restructuring Hypothesis (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983); vs. 2. Indebtedness -driven Reciprocity Cognitive -Restructuring Hypothesis: State Indebtedness should promote under - repayment via Benefit Appraisal ( See Figure 5.2). Indebtedness -Driven Reciprocity: Recipients feeling indebted should, compared to defaulters, be more likely to make restitutions by repaying fully Chapter 5 193 decis ion making in the current context? Trait Indebtedness: 1. Trait Indebtedness -motivated rejection (See UAQ 3 above); 2. Indebtedness -driven helping (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983); 3. Indebtedness -driven reciprocity 1. See UAQ 3 above. 2. Unconditional helpers (in both H elper Trials) should be the most dispositionally indebted (i.e. scoring higher in IS -R than Non-helpers and Conditional helpers); 3. Conditional offer acceptors who under -repaid ( partially or completely ) should report lower IS -R than those who repaid in full (i.e. cooperated) . Chapter 5 194 5.2. Methods 5.2.1. Participants One hundred and thirty -three students from The University of Nottingham participated in the experiment (79 were females, mean age: 22.7 years, SD = 4.7). Each participant was guaranteed a basic allowance of \u00a33 and was automatically entered into a prize draw in which they may win a cash prize up to \u00a335. Participants knew that in each session (N= 8 -10) one of them would be randomly drawn as the winner thus became entitled to that cash prize. 5.2.2. Game Design The present experiment was a modified, repeated version of Experiments 1 and 2 that was conducted with software Z -Tree (Fischbacher, 2007). To begin with each participant was given a fair die to roll and was seated in a separate cubicle. Each experimental se ssion took place with groups of 8 to 10 participants. Participants were told the game included multiple (but had no idea how many) trials, and that they would each be partnered with a different, randomly assigned (and anonymous) fellow participant in each trial. 5.2.2.1. Similarities with Experiments 1 and 2 Each player was initially endowed with 150 money -equivalent 'Bonus Points', and therefore he/she needed 50 additional points to reach the 'Bonus Threshold' (i.e. 200 points) to have a chance to be ente red into the lottery draw to win a cash prize. It was made clear to every player that each bonus point he/she gained would be worth 10 pennies but only when that player made the '200 point threshold' was he/she entitled to the possibility to win any cash prize. Chapter 5 195 The only way to reach that threshold was by rolling a fair, six -sided die once. The possible payoffs were a loss of -50 points, 0 points, and gains of 50, 100, 150, and 200 points depending on the number on the dice. It was emphasi sed that a larger number on the dice did NOT guarantee a more favourable allocation of bonus points. Also, in each trial every player learned that he/she was partnered with an unidentifiable and anonymous fellow participant. Participants were reminded that 'n either joint effort nor competition with your partner is warranted'. Again , participants were led to believe they played with one another although in reality they played on their own. All 'post - die roll' scores were pre -determined with no reference to the actual die -roll. 5.2.2.2. New Features of Experiment 3 In this section I highlighted several new features of Experiment 3. Th ey include d the 'Jackpot Trials'; perspectives of both helpers and recipients; prior knowledge of defaulting rights; and the mani pulation of partners' repayment. a) The 'Jackpot Trials' A new feature of Experiment 3 was that participants were not paid for every trial they played. They were informed that, amongst each session, one participant would be drawn as the winner. And for th at winner his/her cash prize would be based on the performance of a randomly picked trial\u2014the 'Jackpot Trial' (i.e. JT) \u2014 he/she participated. For instance, if a player who won the draw and had achieve d 350 points on his/her JT, then he/she would win a \u00a335-cash prize . It was made clear to the participants that a final score below the 200 point threshold at the JT means that his/her cash prize would remain ZERO. Thus, participants were recommended to take each trial seriously. b) Perspectives of both Helpers and Recipients Chapter 5 196 Participants played as a potential helper ( i.e. P1s ) twice and as a recipient ( i.e. P2 ) eight times in this game. Meanwhile, they did not know a priori in which trial they would play as a P1 or as a P2. The next sections (i.e., b i) and b i i)) detail the chain of decisions a participant had to make. b i.) The Helper Trials (HT) \u2014the first and the final (10th) trial Figure 5. 3. Notification of partners' failure to win any bonuses An HT was almost identical to Experiment 1. All participants, after their die-rolling, were told they ended up with a final score of 350. Thus, they could win a \u00a335-cash prize if they also won the prize draw . They were also informed that their 'partners' acquired just 100 points (i.e. below the threshold) thus would win no bonuses, even if the latter won the lottery (See Figure 5. 3). Figure 5.4. Range of helping options (Helper Trials) As a result, participants were asked if they would help by transferrin g part of their excess points (i.e. 350 - 200 'Threshold' = 150 points), so that in case that partner won the conditional lottery he/she could still acquire some bonus money. Participants could make either an unconditional or a conditional transfer (See Figure 5.4) . Conditional offer givers would then decide a level of repayment out of three alternatives (i.e. Interest -Free, 25% -, or 50% -Interest Chapter 5 197 Offer) as the repayment clause (See Figure 5. 5). All offer givers then specified the transfer magnitude (from the range 100- 150 points ). Figure 5. 5. The Flow of Decisions in the Helper Trials (Trial 1 and Trial 10) Conditional helpers were then notified of their recipients' actual repayment decisions \u2014which belonged to another new feature of Experiment 3 (to be discussed later in e)) \u2014despite their previous agreement. The trial ceased here with participants knowing what their cash prizes would be if they won the lottery Figure 5. 5 outlines the flow of decisions in a helper trial. Participants played as a potential helper in the first (i.e. T1) and the tenth trial (i.e. T10) . b ii). The Recipient Trials (RT s, the 2nd to 9th Trial) Participants told they won (by scoring 350) but their 'partners' lost as they did not make the 200 -point threshold (i.e. 100 Bonus points only) Participants decided if they agreed to help by making a 'donation' (can be not 'free', i.e. conditional ) Participants decided to help Participants did NOT help Fair 'Unconditional' offers (i.e. No Need to Repay) Unfair 'Conditional' offers (i.e. R epayment Demanded) 'Interest -free' offer (Only Give back the 'Principal') 25%-Interest (Principal + a 25% interest) 50%-Interest (Principal + a 50% interest) All conditional offers were 'accepted' by their 'partners' and ' repaid' differently depending on one's assigned condition 'Fairness' Condition (N= 44) i.e. offers repaid FULLY as agreed 'Cheap -riding' Condition (N= 44) i.e. offers repaid PARTLY 'Free -riding' Condition (N= 45) i.e. offers NOT repaid AT ALL Participants informed of 'Partners'' Repayment Decisions, then proceed onto the next trial (Trial 1), or the End of Experiment 3 (Trial 10) Chapter 5 198 All par ticipants purportedly 'lost' the die -rolling game, as they ended up with only 100 Points, and therefore entitled to NO cash prize (for that trial) even if they eventually won the lottery. Nonetheless, every player then learned that his/her 'partner', who 'won' like he/she did in Trial 1 (i.e. getting 350 Bonus Points), offered to help by giving away part (i.e. 100 points ) of his/her excess bonus points (i.e. 350 -200 (Bonus Threshold) =150 points) . Table 5.2 Counter -balancing of the sequences of the offers r eceived (in blocks) Trial/ Block 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 10th (Last) A Helper 25% I-F 50% UC I-F UC 50% 25% Helper B Helper 25% UC I-F 50% UC 50% I-F 25% Helper C Helper 25% 50% UC I-F 50% I-F UC 25% Helper D Helper 25% 50% UC 50% I-F UC 25% Helper E Helper 25% I-F I-F UC 50% UC 50% 25% Helper F Helper 25% UC 50% I-F UC 50% I-F 25% Helper Note . Helper = '50% -Interest' Offers. Participants took turn to receive two unconditional offers, 'interest -free', '25% -interest' and '50% -interest' offers over their eight trials as recipients (Refer to Table 5.2). I counter -balanced, using a Latin square , the order of the conditionality of o ffers a player would receive in six blocks (block A to F). Participants were randomly assigned to one out of these six blocks. Recipients of conditional offers were told their offers were not 'free'. By accepting they undertook an obligation that, in case they eventually won the lottery they would return part of their earnings. For example, a recipient who accepted an 'interest -free' 100 -point offer (i.e. \u00a310) on the 5th trial, who then won the draw (and trial 5 being the JT) thus became entitled to a \u00a320 -cash prize, was expected to repay \u00a310. Meanwhile, unconditional offer recipients were told they were not expected to repay. Participants then decided whe ther to accept (or decline) the offers. They were reminded that a rejection would yield them ZERO payoffs even if they won the lottery. This reminder served to assure that participants understood the financial risks in rejecting any offers . Chapter 5 199 c) Prior Knowle dge of one's 'right to default' Recipients were told they could 'decide whether to repay, and the amount of repayment later' before their acceptance decisions . After indicating offer acceptances (or rejections) participants would rate ten items (shown in Table 5.3) about their emotions toward their helpers . Table 5. 3 Measurement of Recipients' Emotions toward their Offers Item Questions Constructs Represented 1 I feel indebted (i.e. feeling like I owe something) to my partner.

Items 6, 8 and 10 were averaged to form a Benefit Appraisal composite. d) Avenues for Restitutions among Unconditional offer recipients 'Free' (Unconditional) Offers 'Charged' (Conditional) Offers Participants only scored 100 points whereas their 'partners' scored 350 points Receipt of offers with different repayment terms Interest - Free 25%- Interest 50%- Interest Recipients, knowing that they could later on NOT repay , decided whether to Accept or Decline the offers Offers Accepted Offers Rejected 'Free' offers holders: could voluntarily repay their helpers 'Charged' offer holders: Reminder of their Obligated Repayment shown onscreen Repayment Options (as a forced choice) Repay FULLY Repay SOMETHING Repay NOTHING Participants to indicate specifically How Much to repay their partners Chapter 5 200 Figure 5.6. The Flow of Decisions in the Recipient Trials (Trials 2 -9)Chapter 5 201 Acceptors of conditional offers were then shown a reminder of their expected repayment. Immediately after that they would decide whether to repay 'nothing at all', 'some', or 'the whole' of the repayment . Acceptors who chose to give back 'some' then spec ified their intended repayment (See Figure 5.6) . Meanwhile, the present experiment permitted acceptors of unconditional offers to repay voluntarily (See Figure 5. 7 below ). It was, however, reiterated to the acceptors that the helpers 'did not expect to receive any repayment' . Figure 5.7. Available Avenues to Repay for Unconditional Offer Acceptors e). Manipulation of Partners' Repayment (Trial 1 and 10) The fifth new feature of Experiment 3 entails the manipulation of repayment decisions by a participant's 'partner' when the participant played as P1s. I randomly assigned participants into one out of three conditions in which their conditional offers yield ed different repayment (See Figure 5. 5). These conditions included: first, a Fairness condition ( N = 44) in which the 'partners' repaid fully (i.e. cooperation). Alternatively, participants could be assigned to the Cheap -riding condition ( N = 44) where the ir offers were partially repaid. This partial repayment was a randomly -generated figure between 1p and the amount that 'partner' should repay. Or, a participant could end up in the Free - riding condition ( N = 45) in which he/she received utterly no repayment. At the end of each helper trial, every conditional helper was shown the repayment he/she should receive and the repayment he/she actually received (See Figure 5. 8). This serves to highlight to the participants whether their Chapter 5 202 partners had breach ed the agreement . Participants who refused to help or helped unconditionally in Trial 1 were 'immune' to this manipulation . Figure 5. 8 Notification of 'Partners'' Repayment ( Cheap -riding Condition) 5.2.2.3. Analysing Individual Differences in the Game While I retained the assessment of Trait Gratitude \u2014measured by Gratitude -Questionnaire -VI (McCullough et al, 2002) (Cronbach's = .729, k = 6), and Social Desirability Responding \u2014assessed via Paulhus' (1991) Impression Management Scale (Cronbach's = .78 7, k = 19) , in Experiment 3 I added the measure of Trait indebtedness. I adopted the Indebtedness Scale - Revised (Elster et al. , 2005) (Cronbach's = .902, k = 22) in examining how dispositionally indebted a participant was. All these surveys were conducte d after Trial 10 . The entire experimental session ended here and participants were debriefed and received their compensations. 5.2.3. Ethics Statement The present experiment was approved by the ethics committee of the School of Psychology at the University of Nottingham. All participants were aged above 17 and all gave written, informed consent prior to participation as approved by the ethics committee (Approved 14th Oct 2014 ; Ref. Code: 531) . 5.2.4. Outcomes Section Chapter 5 203 In this section I outline and operationalize several crucial test variables in relation to the hypotheses and exploratory aims (Refer to Table 5.1.). 5.2.4.1. Key Variables in the two Helper Trials (HTs, i.e. Tria l 1 and 10) a) Incidence and Conditionality of Helping One primary indicator of cooperative responding (in the two HTs) was the percentage of helping. Apart from exploring the overall participants' cooperativeness (by helping an unknown co -player), one key aspect of this analysis was the change in one's helping decisions over the two HTs. Another indicator of prosociality during the HTs was the levels of repayment a P1 requested from the recipient (i.e. unconditional , interest -free, 25% interest and 50% in terest ). I scrutini sed also the presence (or absence) of change in conditional ities of offers made when participants played P1s again in Trial 10 . Both variables are crucial in relation to certain hypotheses. For instance, the norm-enforcement hypothesis would argue that 'cheap -rode' conditional offer givers (in Trial 1) would give unconditional offers in Trial 10 . Therefore, I specifically coded 1) whether or not conditional helpers at Trial 1 would give unconditional offers in Trial 10; and 2) whether or not conditional helpers at Trial 1 would make more generous offers in Trial 10 (e.g. gave '50% -interest' offer at Trial 1 but made '25% -Interest' offer at Trial 10). b) Magnitude of Transfers In Experiment 3 prospective helpers were granted free dom to decide the range (from 100 - 150) bonus points to transfer in both H elper Trials. Hence, I regarded also the transfer magnitude as a token of prosociality at present. 5.2.4.2. Key Variables in the Recipient Trials (RTs, i.e. Trial 2 to 9 ) a) Offer Ac ceptances and Rejections Chapter 5 204 I examined the proportion of players accepting (or declining) their offers while knowing that they could just take the offers and forget about repaying . b) Pre -repayment Ratings I measured participants' evaluations of their off ers via a series of ratings in 7-point Likert scales (i.e. pre -repayment ratings). As a recurring theme of the thesis, here I specifically inspect how state gratitude and indebtedness would relate to the recipients' cooperativeness (e.g. repayment or the lack thereof). In each RT an item ' My partner could have been more generous to me ' served as a manipulation check. Via this I ascertained participants' awar eness of the various levels of injunctive fairness implied by different offers (i.e. unconditional, 'Interest -free', 25% -interest' and '50% -interest'), and the fact that their helpers could have acted more generous or selfish. Additionally, recipients gave an overall offer appraisal (Wood et al., 2008) by indicating their i) perceived genuine helpfulness, ii) perceived values of the offers, and ii) perceived costliness to the helpers (for helping). I created a composite 'Benefit Appraisal' in each RT by ave raging participants' ratings on items (i) to (iii). c) Categorical and Numerical Repayment Decisions In the present analysis I used the same categorical classifications as Experiment 2 of conditional offer acceptors based on their repayment. Acceptors w ho repaid completely were the cooperators. Those who repaid nothing were termed the free-riders as did Krishnamurthy (2000). Participants whose repayment was short of the expected amount were classified as the cheap -riders (Cornes & Sandler, 1984) . In addi tion to these categorical classifications, I also quantified participants' sanctioning via computing the Chapter 5 205 under -repayment percentage for each acceptor for every receipt. This under - repayment metric (i.e. UR% hereafter) was computed by the formula [100% Repayment/ Expected Repayment)* 100%] . This UR% metrics and the above nominal classifications were NOT applicable in the two RTs where participants received unconditional offers , since these recipients were not expected to repa y unless they volunteered to. Thus , I operationalize the cooperativeness of these unconditional offer acceptors by the magnitude of any voluntary repayment they made . 5.2.4.3. Variables in the Dispositional Assessment In the present experiment I employed the Impression Management Scales (Paulhus, 1991) (Cronbach's = .787, k = 19) , the G ratitude Questionnaire -VI (McCullough et al., 2002) (Cronbach's = .729, k = 6), and the Indebtedness Scales -Revised (Elster et al., 2005) (Cronbach's = .902, k = 22), respectively as the validated assessment of Social Desirability Responding , Dispositional Gratitude and Dispositional Indebtedness . I computed a composite score for each of these inventories via averaging, after reverse - scoring, participants' ratings on these scales. All participants' ratings were on 7-point Likert Scales (i.e. '1': 'Strongly Disagree '; '7': Strongly Agree '). Chapter 5 206 5.3. Results - Methodological Features In this chapter I split the results section into two halves (i.e. Sections 5.3 and 5.4). Importantly, the present section entails the scrutiny over hypotheses related to the methodological features of Experiment 3 (i.e. one-shot versus iterated design, partner repayment manipulation etc.). This sub -section includes also analyses over whethe r the present crucial (decision) variables were confounded by factors such as gender or social desirability responding . Meanwhile, analyses on unanswered questions (i.e. UAQs hereafter) on how state or trait emotions (e.g. gratitude or indebtedness ) impact ed decision - making (in the present game) are discussed in Section 5.4. 5.3.1. UAQ 2: Was the lack of perspectives of both the helpers and recipients to blame for the over -generosity issue in Experiments 1 and 2? I examined two competing hypotheses on how the presence (or lack thereof) of perspectives of both in -game roles would foster prosociality in Experiment 3. The Reduced Responsibility Hypothesis (Burks et al., 2003) \u2014 which predicts playing both roles should undermine prosociality (e.g. less helping or repayment) in Experiment 3 relative to Experiments 1 and 2 (which are both one -shot games); and the Golden Rules Hypothesis (Burks et al., 2003) \u2014which argues that playing both roles should instead encourage prosociality in the present context in comparison to Experiments 1 and 2. 5.3.1.1. Statistical Analyses a) Comparing Helping Decisions (Experiment 1 vs. Experiment 3) To test both the Reduced Responsibility and the Golden Rule Hypotheses I compared several crucial deci sions in the present game to that of Experiments 1 and 2 (i.e. E1 and E2 hereafter). First, I compared the helping Chapter 5 207 decisions (i.e. rate of helping and offer conditionality etc.) in E1 to both Helper Trials (i.e. Trial 1 and 10) in the present game. Data fr om Trial 1 was NOT excluded as participants were aware (before the start) that they could be 'either in a position to help or to receive help ', depending on their (and their partners') 'final score at each trial'. I analysed the difference experimen ts (i.e. E1 vs. Trial 1; or E1 vs. Trial 10) on binary outcome measures (e.g. help or no help) using a 2 (Experiments)*2 (Outcomes) Chi -square test. Here I dichotomized offer conditionality into unconditional or conditional thanks to the low counts of cond itional offer givers of each specific category in E1. I also replaced the analysis of transfer magnitude with whether helpers 'over -donated' (i.e. gave away more than required) as half of the potential helpers ( N = 30) were stipulated to make bigger donati ons in E1. Table 5.4 illustrates the data. b) Comparing Repayment Decisions (Experiments 1 and 2 vs. Experiment 3) To further examine the Reduced Responsibility and Golden Rule Hypotheses I also explored how repayment decisions of the present experiment compared to that of Experiments 1 and 2 . b i.) Comparing Repayment Decisions (Experiment 1 vs. Experiment 3) Owing to the relative low counts ( N = 21) of conditional offer acceptors in E1 I dichotomize these acceptors' repayment into cooperators (i.e. repaying fully) or defaulters (i.e. partial or complete under -repayment). I excluded repayment data from the two present RTs where recipients were unconditionally gifted; since unconditionally gifted recipients in E1 ( N = 25) were not offered any avenues to repay (See Chapter 3). I included also the comparison of under -repayment rate (i.e. UR% hereafter) in E1 with that of the current experiment. Again, the analysis with nominal binary outcomes (i.e. Chapter 5 208 cooperate or default) was done via a 2 (Experiments)*2 (Outcomes) Chi -square test. The numerical variable (i.e. UR %) was examined using the Mann - Whitney U Test. Table 5.5 and Table 5.6 outline the results. b ii.) Comparing Repayment Decisions (Experiment 2 vs. Experiment 3) To analyse how categorical repayment (i.e. repay all, nothing or partially ) of conditional offer acceptors differed across experiments (i.e. Experiment 2 vs. Initial and vs. Second receipts in Experiment 3) \u2014while controlling for offer conditionality \u2014I reso rted Logit Model (i.e. MNLM hereafter). The MNLM permits comparisons of multiple groups via a combination of binary logistic regressions (El -habi, 2012), thus allows each category (e.g. repaying all or nothing ) of the outcome variable to be contrasted with a reference category (e.g. repaying some ) (Fredua, 2015). The current model \u2014 based upon a generalized logit link function (Horton & Lipsitz, 1999) \u2014was examined with a robust variance estimator (Zeger & Liang, 1986) and an exchangeable 'working' correlation structure. This specific analysis was conducted via SAS-callable SUDAAN Release 9.0.1, as statisticians (Hardin & Hilbe, 2003; Horton & Lipsitz, 1999) generally agreed that SUDAAN is one of the only packages that can handle nominal mu ltinomial regressions (i.e. generalized logit link). The findings are detailed in Table 5.7 . Additionally, I examined, via independent samples t -tests, whether the UR% were different in E2 in comparison to both receipts of conditional offers in Experiment 3. Table 5.8 details the findings. 5.3.1.2. Results a) Is helpfulness more prevalent in a single - (E1) or a both -role (E3) design? Chapter 5 209 As shown in Table 5.4, there was no evidence (both ps >. 05) that the rate of offer provisions of Experiment 1 (i.e. 49/61 = 80.3%) differed from that of Trial 1 (i.e. 95/133= 71.4%) or Trial 10 (i.e. 104/ 133= 78.2%). Similar results emerged ( 2 (1) = 0.824, p = .364) when I contrasted the rate of provisions of Experiment 1 (i.e. 71.4%) with the comb ined rates (computed via summing both Trial 1 and Trial 10) of Experiment 3 (i.e. 199/266 = 74.8%) Table 5.4 Comparison of Helping Decisions (E1 vs. E3 T1 vs. E3 T10) 2 p 2 p 1.Helper vs. Non-helper Non-Helper 12 38 29 Helper 49 95 104 Total 61 133 133 1.73 .22 0.11 .74 2.Offer Conditionality Conditional 24 83 84 Unconditional 25 12 20 Total 49 95 104 24.95 <.001 16.21 <.001 3.

The rate of making an unconditional (instead of conditional) transfer was higher (both ps <.001) in Experiment 1 (i.e. 25/49 = 51.0%) than both Trial 1 (i.e. 12/95= 12.6%), Trial 10 (i.e. 20/104= 19.2%) and the overall rates (i.e. 32/199= 16.1%, 2 (1) = 27.12, p <. 001) of Experiment 3. The rate of over - donation in E1 (i.e. 14/49 = 28.6%) was higher ( p = .030) than that of Trial 1(i.e. 12.6%) but was only marginally different ( p = .079) from that of Trial 10 (i.e. 17/104 = 16.3%).The comparison is again significa nt (2 (1) = 5.376, p = .020) when I compared the over -donation rate of Experiment 1 (i.e. 28.6%) to the combined rate of Experiment 3 (i.e. 14.5%). Overall, the current analyses failed to offer conclusive evidence as of whether playing both roles would haunt or promote generosity when participants played as a potential helper. b i.) Are people more trustworthy in a single -(E1) or a both -role (E3) design? Chapter 5 210 The analyses (See Table 5.5 below ) offer no evidence (all ps >. 05) that the propensity to cooperate (or default) was different in a one -shot scenario (i.e. E1) versus in a context where participants played both roles (i.e. E3).

Considering also the comparisons of helping decisions among E1 vs. E3 (i.e. Table 5.6), overall the current data seemed to endorse neither of the Golden Chapter 5 211 Rule nor the Reduced Responsibility Hypo thesis, as the experience of playing both roles apparently neither depressed nor stimulated more trustfulness (i.e. more helping) and trustworthiness (i.e. less under -repayment or defaulting ). b ii.) Are people more trustworthy in a single - (E2) or a both -role (E3) design?

LLOR: Lower Limit Odds Ratio; ULOR: Upper Limit Odds Ratio. * denotes that the 95% CIs did not overlap the null value (i.e. OR=1), implying statistical significance ( Szumilas , 2010). Below I examined whether Golden Rule or the Reduced Responsibility Hypothesis would explain any differences in trustworthiness between that of Experiments 2 and 3. The present multinomial model, which comprises Chapter 5 212 experiments (i.e. Experiment 2 vs. Experiment 3 -Initial vs. Experiment 3 - Second Receipt) as predictor and conditionality (i.e. Interest -free vs. 25% - vs. 50%-Interest) as covariate , is significant ( Wald 2 (12) = 123.9, p <.001). Both variables have significant main effects (i.e. experiments , Wald 2 (4) = 17.18, p =.002; conditionality , Wald 2 (6) = 55.7, p <.001) over repayment (i.e. repay fully vs. partially vs. nothing ). There was, however, no evidence that these two variables had interacted to influence repayment ( Wald 2 (7) = 11.1, p =.13). I detail in the following a breakdown of the significant effect by experiments . Scrutiny of the odds ratios (i.e. OR hereafter) suggested that acceptors from experiment 2 (N= 87), compared to either receipt in Experi ment 3, were , in general, more reluctant to partially repay (i.e. cheap -ride). For instance, acceptors from E2 were, compared to the initial acceptance in E3, 2.41 times (i.e. 95% CI (1.13, 5.13)) more likely to repay all than to repay partially . They were also 3.70 times (i.e. 95% CI (1.28, 10.73)) likelier to repay nothing rather than to repay partially , compared to acceptors of initial offers in Experiment 3. A similar trend was observed (See Table 5.7 above) when contrasting the categorical repayment in E2 to that of the second offer acceptance in E3. The former were 2.94 times likelier (i.e. 95% CI (1.36, 6.32)) than the latter to repay fully instead of partially . There was marginal evidence that (i.e. 95% CI (0.95, 6.88)) the former would prefer (OR: 2.56) repaying nothing than partially , compared to the present participants who accepted their conditional offers in their second receipts. There was no evidence that E2 participants' decisions to repay fully or none differed from that of in Experiment 3. Taken together, the current analyses imply an 'all -or-nothing' repaying mindset of acceptors in Experiment 2. They appeared to prefer either honouring their Chapter 5 213 obligations totally or simply shirking from that altogether . Thus, again there is no clear -cut evidence that people are overall more (or less) trustworthy in a single - vis-\u00e0-vis a both-role context. Neither the Golden Rule nor the Reduced Responsibility Hypothesis was confirmed.

Taken together, apart from the sporadic evidence (See Table 5.7) that acceptors in Experiment 2 were less likely to cheap -ride, overall the current data barely supports either the Gold en Rule Hypothesis or the Reduced Responsibility Hypothesis. Participants who accepted their conditional offers appeared more or less trustworthy with (i.e. Experiment 3) or without (i.e. Experiment 2) the perspectives of both helpers and recipients . 5.3.1 .3. Conclusion All in all, the above extensive comparisons of decision -making in Experiments 1 and 2 to that of Experiment 3 did not supply any clear -cut evidence that the present two-role, repeated game design had either raised or undermined participants' in -game generosity or trustworthiness. Therefore, the Chapter 5 214 current analyses failed to justify the over -generosity issues evident in Experiments 1 and 2 by the single -role design in both experiments . 5.3.2. UAQ 3: Were rejections in Experiment 2 attributable to negative reciprocity or dispositional indebtedness? I predicted that, thanks to the recipients' knowledge of a more efficient way to retaliate (i.e. take the offer and not repay), the offer rejecti on rate should be noticeably lower in Experiment 3 than in Experiment 2 (i.e. 35.6%) if negative reciprocity was what engendered rejections in Experiment 2 (See Table 1) . I also hypothesi sed that rejections at present should be primarily driven by trait indebtedness and as a result, the rejectors of conditional offers should be more dispositionally indebted than the acceptors. Below I include the comparison of rejections across Experiments 2 and 3, alongside the analyses over the psychology of the present rejectors. It should be noted that analyses relating to how indebtedness (as a state or trait) contributed to prosociality (e.g. helping or repayment ) in Experiment 3 will be featured in Section 5.4. 5.3.2.1. Statistical Analyses a) Comparing the Rates of Conditional offer rejections in Experiment 2 and 3 There was no evidence that conditionality had affected offer rejections in Experiment 2, 2 (3) = 3.30, p = .23 (See Chapter 4). Thus, via a Generalised Estimating Equation (i.e. GEE hereafter) \u2014with an e xchangeable correlation structure \u2014I first examined whether conditionality would alone, or interacted with the order of receipt (i.e. initial vs. second) to, predict rejection in Experiment 3. In this analysis I excluded data from the two Recipient Trials during which participants received unconditional offers. Chapter 5 215 Second, to directly compare the overall landscapes of conditional offer rejections in both experiments (i.e. E2 and E3 hereafter) I carried out a three - way, 2*2*4, Log -linear analysis. The two -level factors were Experiments (i.e. E2 vs. E3) and Acceptances (or rejection), while the four -level factor was Conditionality (i.e. Interest -Free vs. 12.5% vs. 25% vs. 50% -Interest). b) Trait Indebtedness and Offer Rejections The Mann -Whitney U test was adopted in examining whether offer rejectors would, as predicted, report higher trait indebtedness than acceptors. Participant s' each receipt of their eight offers (of varying conditionality) was separately analysed . Table 5.9 details the findings. 5.3.2.2. Results a) Comparing Conditional offer Rejections in Experiment 2 and 3: Is Negative Reciprocity (i.e. to sanction unfair he lpers) driving rejections in Experiment 2? First, results of the GEE revealed only a significant main effect by conditionality on rejection in Experiment 3 (Wald 2 (2) = 29.3, p <.001). Particularly , scrutiny of the odds ratios indicated that compared to the ' Interest - free' offers; the odds of rejecting (over accepting) was 10.53 times ( Wald 2 (1) = 17.87, p <.001) higher upon receipts of 50%-Interest offer, and the odds of rejecting was also 8.13 times higher ( Wald 2 (1) = 11 .63, p <.001) when participants received the 25%-Interest offers. Meanwhile, the odds of rejection were 2.35 times higher ( Wald 2 (1) = 11.16, p <.001) when participants received a 50%- instead of a 25%-interest offer . Secondly, the log -linear analysis showed that the model which retained only the two -way interactions (e.g. Experiment s * Acceptance and Conditionality * Acceptance ) would fit the data best, Likelihood Ratio 2 (3) = Chapter 5 216 7.88, p = .056. The significant Conditio nality * Acceptance interaction (partial 2 (3) = 37.5, p <.001) echoes the above GEE analysis which highlights that rejections would hinge on conditionality . More importantly, the significant Experiment s* Acceptance interaction (partial 2 (1) = 39.8, p <.001) shed light upon the noticeable difference between offer rejections in Experiment 2 (i.e. 48/135 = 35.6%) and Experiment 3 (i.e. 95/ 798 = 11.9%). This shows that the availability of an alternative (and more cost -effective) punishing means in Experi ment 3 has significantly diminished offer rejections, thus hinting that negative reciprocity may have underlain the high rejections in Experiment 2. b) Testing the Dispositional Indebtedness -driven Rejection Hypothesis Table 5.9 Effect of Trait Indebtedness on rejection (by Conditionality) Average Indebtedness Scale -Revised (IS -R) Scores (by Offer Acceptances) Receipt Conditionality Accept Reject Mann -Whitney U N Mean (SD) N Mean (SD) N U Initial Unconditional 129 4.89 (0.95) 4 5.22 (1.25) No Analyses Donea Second Unconditional 130 4.89 (0.94) 3 5.42 (1.44) No Analyses Donea Initial Interest -Free 130 4.92 (0.95) 3 4.36 (1.07) No Analyses Donea Second Interest -Free 128 4.92 (0.94) 5 4.71 (1.41) No Analyses Donea Initial 25%-Interest 112 4.95 (0.91) 21 4.68 (1.13) (0.90) 133 1203.0 Note . a No analysis was done owing to insufficient counts of rejectors. * p <. 05 (2 -tailed) The present data (See Table 5.9) sternly dispels the speculation that dispositional indebtedness was responsible for the observed irrational rejections in the current experiment. Rejectors overall appeared similarly dispositionally indebted compared to the acceptors (at almost all levels of conditionality). Nonetheless, it is worth notin g that the current lop -sided acceptor -rejector distribution (See Table 5.9) may render the results questionable. 5.3.2.4. Conclusion Predictably, the knowledge about the availability of an alternative avenue to retaliate clearly contributed to the lower re jections in Experiment 3. It was worth noting that the participants still displayed a higher propensity to shun Chapter 5 217 the highly 'taxed' offers (i.e. the 25% - and 50% -interest offers) despite knowing that they 1) were financially better off accepting that and, 2 ) could default as they wished. Such an economically irrational rejection, contrary to what was predicted in this chapter, appeared unrelated to trait indebtedness. 5.3.3. UAQ 4: Does being 'cheap -rode' prompt the victims to play fair? The present norm -enforcement hypothesis (i.e. NEH hereafter) predicted that the 'cheap -rode' conditional helpers in T1 ( N = 30) should, compared to those whose 'taxed' offers were fully repaid ( N = 24) or utterly not repaid ( N = 29), exhibit a greater pursuit of injunctive fa irness eventually via making more generous offers in T10 or avoid under -repaying any accepted (conditional) offers. The following presents the analyses of the NEH. 5.3.3.1. Statistical Analyses Here I examined two crucial outcome variables. They included a ) categorical repayment of accepted conditional offers, and b) whether a more generous offer (See 5.2.4.1 for details) was made in T10. To analyse the effect of repayment manipulation (Trial 1, i.e. fairness vs. free -ride vs. cheap -ride), while controlling for offer conditionality (i.e. Interest -free vs. 25% - vs. 50% -Interest), on participants' (N= 83) categorical repayment (i.e. repay partially (or cheap -ride) vs. nothing (or free -ride) vs. fully (or cooperate)) I once again resorted to the Multinomial Logit model (Hardin & Hilbe, 2003). The current model, which was based upon a generalized logit link function, was analysed with a robust variance estimator and an exchangeable correlation structure. This specific analysis was administered using SUDAAN (Bieler & Williams, 1997; Shah, 1998). Table 5.10 illustrates the results. Chapter 5 218 Meanwhile, the GEE analysis on whether partner repayment manipulation (in T1) predicted increased generosity in T10 (i.e. Yes or No) was conducted using SPSS v. 22. Both nominal regression analyses would exclude non-helpers and unconditional helpers (Total N = 50) from T1 as both parties were unaffected by the repayment manipulation. Furthermore, the analysis of categorical repayment only entailed cases in which participants accepted their conditional offers, as the current analysis primarily concerns how people repay their 'taxed' offers subject to how their own recipients repaid them previously 5.3.3.2. Results a) Testing if being 'Cheap -rode' prompted more trustworthiness during the RTs The overall model, which comprises manipulation (i.e. Conditions 'Fairness' vs. 'Free -ride' vs. 'Cheap -ride') as the predictor and offer conditionality (i.e. Interest -free vs. 25% - vs. 50% -Interest) as a covariate , is significant ( Wald 2 (10) = 86.87, p <.001). Both variables were shown to have signif icant main effects (i.e. manipulation , Wald 2 (4) = 16.70, p =.002; offer conditionality , Wald 2 (4) = 36.63, p <.001) over repayment (i.e. repay fully vs. partially vs. nothing ). There was, meanwhile, no evidence (i.e. Wald 2 (8) = 12.01, p =.15) that manipulation had interacted with conditionality to significantly influence repayment. In the following I detail the scrutiny of the main effect manipulation . Table 5.10 below summari ses the findings. Scrutiny of the odds ratios (See Table 5.10 below) revealed that, compared to helpers whose initial offers were fully repaid ( N = 24, i.e. 'Fairness' condition), partially repaid helpers ( N = 30, i.e. 'Cheap -riding' condition) were 4.84 times more likely (i.e. 95% CI (1.88, 12.48)) to also partially repay their own conditional offers than repaying fully. Meanwhile, Chapter 5 219 compared to helpers whose initial offers were utterly not repaid (i.e. 'Free - riding' condition, N = 30), 'cheap -rode' helpers were also 3.85 times (i.e. 1/0.26) more likely (i.e. 95% CI (1.03, 14.3)) to also partially repay than not repay their conditional offers. Nonetheless, the current data offered no indication that 'cheap -rode' helpers, compared to fully repaid or 'free-rode' helpers, were more propelled to repay fully or to refrain from totally defaulting on their (accepted) conditional offers.

Chapter 5 220 In short, the data revealed that instead of feeling more prompted to cooperate or refrain from free-riding (as hypothesi sed), participants who were subject to others' cheap -riding acts tended more to 'pay it forward' when opportunity beckons. Participants were simply mimicking the cheap -riding antics from their own recipients (T1) when it became their turns to decide how they would respond to a conditional offer (i.e. the 8 Recipient Trials). In other words, the norm enforcement hypothesis of cheap -riding was not supported. b) Testing if being ' Cheap -rode' prompted more Generosity in Trial 10 The data revealed a significant effect of partner repayment in T1( Wald 2 (2) = 5.99, p = .050) on whether a more generous offer was shown in T10. Specifically, scrutiny of the ORs indicated that, compared to a ' free-rode' helper, a 'cheap -rode' helper was 4.78 times more likely (Wald 2 (1) = 5.75, p = .017) to showcase more generosity in T 10. There was, however, no evidence (Wald 2 (1) = 0.19, p = .67) that the odds of giving a more generous offer in T10 were different among the fully-repaid and 'cheap -rode' conditional helpers. 5.3.3.3. Conclusion The present data offered minimal endorsem ent to the norm -enforcement hypothesis \u2014which predicted that experience of being 'cheap -rode' should inspire more eventual fair (or generous) gestures from the victims. Particularly, the analyses on the categorical repayment decisions (See Table 5.10) hinte d that the manner through which a conditional helper was repaid had established an unofficial guideline for that helper to follow through when he/she was to repay his/her own taxed offers. Furthermore, analyses on whether the experience of being 'cheap -rode' had contributed to more generosity in Trial 10 (i.e. second Helper Trial) also revealed inconclusive findings. While 'cheap -Chapter 5 221 rode' helpers were more tempted to showcase more generosity than 'free -rode' helpers, there was no evidence t hat these 'cheap -rode' helpers were more inclined to be generous compared to the fully repaid helpers. All in all, the present analyses overall fails to confirm the notion that cheap -riding could help safeguard normative fairness in a fashion that is relat able to altruistic punishment. 5.3.4. General Confounds This sub -section explores the effects of two general confounds, namely 1) Gender, and 2) Social Desirability Responding (SDR), on the key variables. 5.3.4.1. Effect of Gender The below presents the an alyses on the potential role of gender in participants' decision -making in the two Helper Trials (i.e. HTs, Trial 1 and 10) and the eight Recipient Trials (i.e. RTs, Trial 2 to 9) in between. a) Statistical Analyses I examined several crucial decisions in both HTs. They included a) decisions to help or not; b) conditionality of offers made (i.e. unconditional , interest -free, 25% or 50%-Interest) ; c ) transfer magnitude and d) whether or not a more generous offer was made in T10 among conditional helpers in T1 ( N = 83). Meanwhile, scrutiny of gender effect on decisions in the eight Recipient Trials entails the following: i) offer acceptance (or rejection); ii) categorical repayment (i.e. partial , zero or full repayment); and iii) numerical repayment (i.e. repayment amount and under -repayment rate (UR %)). Unless otherwise specified, the GEE method \u2014with an exchangeable correlation structure \u2014was employed to examine if gender significantly influenced any of the decision variables. Particularly , I analysed the effect of Chapter 5 222 gender, while including trial order (i.e. T1 vs. T10) as a covariate , on the conditionality of offers made \u2014which is a nominal multinomial variable \u2014via SUDAAN. I also adopted SUDAAN (Bieler & Williams, 1997; Shah, 1998) when exami ning whether gender affected participants' categorical repayment (while including repayment terms as a covariate). These two models \u2014both based upon a generalized logit link function \u2014were analysed with a robust variance estimator and an exchangeable working correlation structure. b) Results bi.) Gender and Decision -making in the two Helper Trials (Trials 1 and 10) First, the analyses revealed no signs that gender had a) on its own (Wald 2 (1) = 1.23, p = .27), or b) interacted with trial order (i.e. T1 vs. T10) (Wald 2 (1) = 1.75, p = .19), to affect decisions of whether to help. Gender was also found not to have independently ( Wald 2 (1) = 0.11, p = .74), nor interacted with trial order (Wald 2 (1) = 2.00, p = .16) to influence transfer magnitude should a participant agreed to help. Additionally, gender was not instrumental (Wald 2 (1) = 0.027, p = .87) in predicting whether a conditional helper ( N = 83) in T1 be more generous in T10. Meanwhile, the multinomial analyses revealed that gender had neither on its own (Wald 2 (1) = 0.03, p = .87), nor interacted with trial order (Wald 2 (3) = 5.55, p = .14), to affect helpers' preferred repayment clauses (i.e. No repayment needed vs. Zero - vs. 25% - vs. 50% -Interest) to attach to their offers. bii.) Gender and Decision -making in the Recipient Trials (i.e. T2 to T9) The gender effect on offer acceptance was qualified by a significant Gender * Conditionality (i.e. unconditional vs. interest -free vs. 25% vs. 50%) interaction (Wald 2 (3) = 12.51, p = .006) . While gender (Wald 2 (1) = 1.74, p Chapter 5 223 = .187) did not predict more acceptances, the effect of conditionality remained significant (Wald 2 (3) = 38.4, p < .001) . Breaking down the interaction, there was no evidence (all ps >.05) that the odds of female (over male) rejection (instead of acceptances) differed across levels of conditionality . Analyses over instances of conditional offer acceptances indicated neither direct (Wald 2 (1) = 0.28, p = .60) nor indirect (interaction with conditionality) (Wald 2 (1) = 0.91, p = .64) effects of gender on under - repayment rate. Lastly, multinomial analyses revealed no signs that gender had a) on its own (Wald 2 (2) = 3.09, p = .21), or b) interacted with conditionality (i.e. Unconditional, Interest -free, 25%, 50% -Interest) (Wald 2 (6) = 3.05, p = .80), to affect repayment (i.e. repay partially vs. repay nothing vs. repay fully). c) Conclusion All in all , the current data indicated a near total absence of gender effect on the list of crucial behavioural variables in Experiment 3. In other words, participants did not, in this context, show glimpses of varying trustfulness (as a helper) or trustworthiness (as a recipient) subject to gender. 5.3.4.2. Effect of Social Desirability Responding (i.e. SDR hereafter) In the below sub -section I detail the analyses on the role of SDR may play in participants' decision -making throughout Experiment 3. a) Statistical Analyses Similar to the above gender effect analyses, here I examined how SDR would relate to the same set of dec ision variables (e.g. whether to help; offer acceptances etc.) in Experiment 3. As addressed in Section 5.2.4.3 at present I Chapter 5 224 operationally defined participants' SDR as their average composite ratings in Paulhus's (1991) Impression Management Scale (i.e. IM S hereafter). b) Results bi.)

Chapter 5 225 For instance, Spearman's correlation showed that Impression Management Scale score was positively \u2014albei t weakly \u2014associated with, a) (all) helpers' ( N = 95) transfer magnitude ( rs (93) = .24, p = .019); and b) conditional helpers' ( N = 83) transfer magnitude ( rs (81) = .23, p = .035) in T1. However, both correlations ceased to exist (all ps >.05) in Trial 10 (See Table 5.11). bii.) SDR and Decision -making in the Recipient Trials (i.e. T2 to T9) Table 5.12 a.

As shown in Table 5.12a , the present data provided no substances to the speculation that SDR prompted more offer acceptances (or rejections). T he similar conclusion applied to acceptors' repayment decisions in that (See Table 5.12b) IMS overall failed to differentiate acceptors who repaid fully, partially, and nothing at all, after they accepted t he offers. SDR was not correlated ( ps >.05) to almost all under -repayment rates of offers of different conditionality.

Pairwise comparison illustrated a significant difference in IMS between cheap -riders (M: 3.70) and cooperators (two-tailed) on under -repayment rates and IMS. * IMS was negatively correlated to UR% for the initial receipt of 25% - offer ( r (110) = -.215, p = .023). Chapter 5 226 c) Conclusion While the present analyses indicated sporadic signs (e.g. associations between transfer magnitude and IMS) that SDR was related to participants' prosociality, overall the results did not suggest that SDR had consistently heightened both participants' trust fulness (i.e. in both HTs) and trustworthiness (i.e. in T2 to T9). As such, the present analyses should speak volumes about the minimal interference of SDR with the present major decision variables. Chapter 5 227 5.4. Results - Gratitude, Indebtedness and Decision Making In this sub-section I present analyses tackling the unanswered questions (UAQs) or research themes that involved state and trait gratitude (and indebtedness) and decision making in Experiment 3. 5.4.1. UAQ 1: Does more unfairness re ally 'not matter'? To tackle UAQ 1 the present analysis tested two competing hypotheses on how transparency of helpers' available options would influence recipients' offer appraisals. T he Inelastic Fairness Construal (i.e. IFC) argument \u2014which predicts a dichotomous ' fair versus unfair' contrast in intent and emotions among the unconditional and the conditional offers (i.e. more (or less) unfairness would not count); and Wood et al.'s (2011) Gratitude Relativity Hypothesis (i.e. GRH) \u2014which proposes a graded , linear fairness appraisals of offers of varying repayment obligations (i.e. more unfairness matters). 5.4.1.1. Statistical Analysis I adopted a 2 (Offer Receipts: Initial vs. Second ) X 4 (Conditionalities: Unconditional vs. Interest -Free vs. 25%-Interest vs. 50%-Interest) repeated ANOVA on all the pre -repayment rating items. Two -tailed Bonferroni analyses were conducted to further examine any significant main effects or interactions. 5.4.1.2. Results a) Manipulation Check: Perceived Inadequate Generosity In each recipient trial the item ' My partner could have been more generous to m e' was included to examine if participants were aware of the varying extent of injunctive fairness (or lack thereof) of each offer they received. The results revea led only a main effect of Conditionality (F (2.07, 273) = 131.7, p <.001). Importantly, the Bonfer roni post-hoc analyses revealed Chapter 5 228 a significant linear trend, F (1,132) = 212, p <. 001, which illustrated that perceived inadequacy generosity was highest among receipts of 50%-interest offer ( M: 5.12; SD: 0.15) and of offers ( M: 2.17, SD: 0.13) (See Table 5.13 and 5.14). Therefore, the present conditionality manipulation succeeded in leading recipients to acknowledge the varying extent of generosity (implying different injunctive fairness) across offers.

Breaking down these main effects, post-hoc analyses (See Table 5.14) overall revealed that the higher the expected repayment the lower the positive affective responses (e.g. feeling less affective gratitude). Recipients also felt more annoyed by; less obligated to repay, and interestingly, less indebted to helpers who demanded more back -transfer. Recipients' disapproval of more unfair offers was also Chapter 5 229 evidenced by their graded responses (See Table 5.13) on item 'I would have done the same thing were I in my partn er's shoes' (i.e. Perspective -Taking). 5.4.1.3. Conclusion Instead of feeling similarly unimpressed with a more blatant deviation from normative fairness, the current data sternly refuted the IFC as recipients demonstrated a graded appraisal (i.e. emotion s and intent) with respect to the varying fairness connoted across offers. This suggests that injunctive fairness does not function in an 'all -or-nothing' fashion as relativity matters. I interpret this as an example of recipients computing the worth of their offers relative to what they could have got, thanks to their newfound access to helpers' behavioural alternatives in Experiment 3. In short, the GRH was confirmed. 5.4.2. R ecurring Research Theme 1: Does gratitude, as a state or a trait, nurture prosociality (or undermine antisociality) in economic games? In this sub -section I examine how state gratitude would on its own (i.e. the Moral Barometer and Moral Motive Hypothese s of Gratitude, McCullough et al., 2001), or in conjunction with trait gratitude (i.e. the Social Cognitive Model of Gratitude; Wood et al., 2008) in preserving cooperation (or undermining sanctioning ) in the present experiment. 5.4.2.1. Moral Barometer and Moral Motive Hypotheses of Gratitude Both Moral Hypotheses of Gratitude (McCullough et al., 2001) would dismiss partial or complete under -repayment among any grateful conditional offer acceptors . As such, a sharp contrast between state gratitude of cooperators and that of both cheap - and free-riders should be expected. a) Statistical Analyses Chapter 5 230 A generalised estimating equation (i.e. GEE) method with an exchangeable correlation structure was used to analyse the data. I excluded participants' ( N = 133) responses in their two RTs in which they received unconditional offers. I also excluded the 95 instances of rejections as this analysis focused only on how state gratitude relates to repayment preferences of the acceptors . In summary, here I examined ho w participants' categorical repayment (i.e. cooperate , cheap -ride or free-ride) would be related to their state gratitude in each of their six receipts of conditional offers (total receipts = 133* 6 = 798). Bonferroni pairwise comparisons were administered to further break down how this relationship may differ across each level of repayment. Additionally, I ran a hierarchical linear regression inspecting how state gratitude would predict under -repayment rate (i.e. UR %), with expected repayment and order of receipts (i.e. initial or subsequent ) being the first and second variables entered prior to state gratitude. b) Results The results of GEE indicated a significant d ifference (Wald 2 (2) = 38.54, p <.001) on the state gratitude (toward helpers) rating that preceded cheap -riding, cooperation and free-riding. Post -hoc analyses illustrated that instances of cooperation (N = 386; M: 5.01; SE: 0.12) were preceded by higher state gratitude (both ps <.001) than both cheap -riding ( 0.31). There was marginal ( p = .057) evidence suggesting that cheap -riding were preceded by higher state gratitude (toward the offers) than free-riding. The regression analysis gave substance to the argument that state gratitude should restrain under -repayment (i.e. Moral Motive Hypothesis). Beta Chapter 5 231 coefficients for the three predictors were expected repayment, = .159, t = 4.19, p < .001 ; receipts, = .021, t = 0.58, n.s.; and state gratitude, = -.159, t = - 5.01, p < .001 . The best fitting model for predicting under -repayment rate is a linear combination of expected repayment and state gratitude ( R = .280, R2 = .076, F (2,700) = 29.9, p < .001). The data suggested that a) the higher the stipulated repayment the greater extent the acceptors would under -repay; and b) the more gratitude the acceptors felt the less prone they were to under -repay at full throttle. Additionally, a simple linear regression analysis showed that the magnitude of voluntary repayment upon unconditional offer acceptances ( N= 259) could be predicted by state gratitude, = .130, t (257) = 2.11, p = .036. c) Conclusion Overall the analyses were mostly in support of the Moral Barometer and Moral Motive Hypotheses of Gratitude (McCullough et al., 2001). Specifically, results of the GEE highlighted that cooperators consistently experienced more state gratitude toward the offers than both cheap - and free-riders In addition , results of the hierarchical regression demonstrated that state gratitude inversely predicted one's extent of under -repayment (while holding expected repayment constant). Thus, consistent with the Moral Motive Hypothesis which argues that state gratitude should restrain intent to undermine benefactors' well -being, at present state gratitude seemed to put a handbrake on how people defaulted. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that although instances of defaulting (cheap - and free-riding inclusive) were preceded by lower gratitude than were cooperating, cheap -riders still on average reported a non -negligible extent of gratitude (M: 4.22; SE: 0.16). Thus, contrary to my prediction (See Table 5.1) the experience of gratitude still wo uld not entirely eradicate defaulting. Chapter 5 232 5.4.2.2. Social Cognitive Model of Gratitude (i.e. SCMG) (Wood et al. 2008) While the above addresses the direct effect of state gratitude over defaulting, in this sub-section I examined how the interplay between dispositional and state gratitude, as theorise d in the SCMG, would contribute to people's decisions to under -repay in Experiment 3. Figure 5. 9. The SCMG ( Wood et al., 2008) Prediction on Defaulting a) Statistical Analyses I analysed the path model in Figure 5. 9 via Hayes's (2013) PROCESS using the Bootstrap Confidence Intervals (CI) approach (5000 Bootstrap samples). Participants' individual receipt of their six conditional offers was separately analysed. I subjected the model (Figure 5.9) to the analyses which focus on under -repayment rate , composite benefit appraisal and state gratitude for each receipt of offer of varying conditionality (i.e. Interest -free, 25% and 50%-Interest). T he current analyses only included the 703 instances (i.e. N= 703) in which a conditional offer was accepted . Table 5.15 details the results. b) Results and Conclusion Table 5.15 Regression Coefficients , Standard Errors ( SEs), and Model Summary Information for the Path Model (Figure 5.9) under scrutiny Indirect Effect of Trait Gratitude on UR% (serially mediated by Benefit Appraisal then State Gratitude) Receipt Con N Co- efficient Bootstrap SE Bootstrap LLCI Bootstrap 50% N CIs Lower (Upper) Limit The results (See Table 5.15) revealed that the hypothesi sed total indirect effect (i.e. Trait Gratitude Benefit Appraisal State Gratitude UR %) was Trait Gratitude (TG) Benefit Appraisal (BA) State Gratitude (Gs) Under - repayment % (UR %) Chapter 5 233 non-significant at every conditional offer receipt. This statistical non - significance was represented by the CIs which include zero at 95% levels of confidence (See Table 5.15). Hence, similar to Experiment 2, there was again no evidence that state gratitude (along with composite benefit app raisal) would mediate the path between trait gratitude and prosociality. 5.4.3. Recurring Research Theme 2: Does indebtedn ess, as a state or a trait, nurture prosociality (or undermine antisociality) in economic games ? This sub-section details the analys es on hypotheses (e.g. Cognitive Restructuring Hypothesis) in relation to how indebtedness, as a state or a trait, affected participants' cooperativeness or the lack thereof in Experiment 3. 5.4.3.1. Does state indebtedness promote or suppress trustworthiness? As summari sed in Table 5.1 the present chapter entails scrutiny over two competing predictions on how state indebtedness would influence participants' decisions to under -repay or repay fully. The Indebtedness -driven Reciprocity Argument \u2014which argues an inverse relationship between state indebtedness and under -repayment, and the Cognitive Restructuring Hypothesi s (i.e. CRH) (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983) \u2014which argues that indebtedness should indirectl y promote under -repayment via more cynical benefit appraisals. a) Statistical Analyses To test the Indebtedness -driven Reciprocity argument I adopted a GEE with an exchangeable correlation structure. I examined how participants' categorical repayment (i.e. cooperate , cheap - or free-ride) decisions related to their state indebtedness in each of their receipts of conditional offers (total receipts = 133* 6 = 798). Bonferroni pairwise analyses were used to delve into how this relationship may differ across each level of repayment. I also ran a Chapter 5 234 hierarchical linear regression testing how state indebtedness predicted under - repayment rate, with expected repayment and receipts (i.e. initial or subsequent ) being the first and second variables entered prior to state indebtedness. Figure 5.10 CRH's (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983) Prediction on Defaulting To test the CRH I examined the path model (See Figure 5. 10) using the PROCESS (Hayes, 2013) with 5000 Bootstrap samples . This analysi s examined only the 703 instances (i.e. N = 703) in which a conditional offer was accepted , while controlling for variables expected repayment (i.e. Interest -Free, 25% - Interest and 50% -Interest) and offer receipts ( initial or second receipts). The results are summari sed in Table 5.16 and Figure 5. 11. b) Results bi.) Testing if State Indebtedness would enhance trustworthiness The results of GEE indicated a significant effect of repayment (Wald 2 (2) = 18.71, p <.001) on state indebtedness. Bonferroni analyses indicated that, similar to state gratitude (See Section 5.4.2.1) , instances of cooperation were (N = 386; M: 4.64; SE: 0.15) preceded by higher state indebtedness (both ps <.05) than both cheap -riding 0.35). There was no evidence ( p = .997) that cheap -riders and free-riders experienced different state indebtedness toward their helpers. The regression analysis provided further confirmation of Indebtedness -driven Reciprocity argument. Beta coefficients for the three predictors were expected repayment, = .186, t = 4.99, p < .001 ; offer receipts, = .029, t = 0.81, n.s.; and state indebtedness, = -.147, t = -3.95, p < .001 . The best fitting model for predicting under -repayment rate is a linear combination of expected repayment, State Indebtedness (Is) Benefit Appraisal (BA) Under -repayment % (UR %) Chapter 5 235 and state indebtedness ( R = .257, R2 = .063, F (2,700) = 24.7, p < .001). The data suggested that a) the higher the stipulated repayment the greater extent of under -repayment would be; and b) the more indebtedness experienced by the acceptors the more they would give back. Additionally, a simple linear regression analysis revealed that the magnitude of voluntary repayment of unconditional offers ( N= 259) significantly regressed on state indebtedness, = .262, t (257) = 4.36, p < .001 . Taken together, the current data confirmed the Indebtedness -driven Reciprocity argument as state indebtedness appeared to both preserve trustworthiness and foster voluntary back -transfer. bii.) Would State Indebtedness lead to increased under -repayment via more cynical benefit appraisals (i.e. Cognitive Restructuring Hypothesis (CRH)))? Table 5.16 Regression Coefficients, Standard Errors, and Model Summary Information for the CRH prediction on under -repayment rate (Figure 5.11) Consequent M (Benefit Appraisal) Y (Under -repayment %) Antecedents Coeff SE p Coeff SE p X (State Indebtedness) a 0.342 0.02 <.001 c -1.354 0.81 .0940 M Note. Co 1 and Co2: Covariate s 1 and 2 Figure 5.11 S tatistical diagram of analysis over the CRH prediction on UR% The data, as detailed in Table 5.16 and Figure 5.11, refuted the CRH as it reflected that state indebtedness indirectly affected under -repayment in an opposite direction as anticipated by the CRH. The bias -corrected bootstrap 95% CI for the present indirect effect ( ab = 0.34* -4.12 = -1.41) did not include zero (-2.32 to -0.58), thus implying statistical significance. Acceptors feeling more X M Y State Indebtedness Benefit Appraisal Composite Under -repayment % (i.e. UR %) a = 0.342, p <.001 b = -4.122, p <. 001 . c = -1.354, n.s. Chapter 5 236 indebted were more inclined to think positively about their 'taxed' offers ( a = 0.342, p <.001 ). Understandably, this positive evaluation will predict a lower under -repayment rate ( increased trustworthiness) ( b = -4.12, p <.001 ). c) Conclusion All in all, state indebtedness in Experiment 3 appeared to facilitate cooperative economi c decisions in a similar fashion as state gratitude. Although the current experimental features (e.g. double -blinded , partner -switching design etc.) should in theory breed cognitive restructuring (Greenberg, 1980; Greenberg & Westcott, 1983), the observed positive link between indebtedness and benefit appraisal dispels the idea that people would try to escape from their feeling of indebtedness by negatively appraising their offers (which includes demonising one's helper, or belittling the value of the benefits that they were bestowed upon (Hatfield & Sprecher, 1983)). People, meanwhile, still considered direct reciprocity as the 'major mode of indebtedness reduction (pp.95)' (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983), even in a situation where the absence of the need to repay was very much emphasi sed (i.e. unconditional offer). 5.4.3.2. Does trait indebtedness promote or suppress cooperation? This sub -section features the analyses on the two hypotheses regarding how trait indebtedness would influence participants' decisions in the helper trials (i.e. Indebtedness -driven Helping ('Helping Argument' hereafter)) and in the recipient trials (i.e. I ndebtedness -driven Repayment ('Repayment Argument' hereafter)). Specifically, the 'Helping Argument' predicts that dispositionally indebted helpers will be more likely to help unconditionally . Meanwhile, the 'Repayment Argument' states that dispositionally indebted recipients will always refrain from partially or fully defaulting (See Table 5.1). Chapter 5 237 a) Statistical Analyses To test the 'Helping Argument' I examined several outcome measures of the two helper trials (i.e. Trial 1 and 10). They were i) decisions t o help or not; ii) whether (and how) participants changed their 'Help versus No Help' decisions in Trial 10; iii) conditionality of offers made; and the iv) transfer magnitude . The results are summari sed in a nutshell in Table 5 .17. To test the 'Repayment Argument' I ran a hierarchical regression analysis examining how trait indebtedness would predict under -repayment rate, while controlling for both expected repayment (i.e. Interest -Free, 25% - and 50%-Interest) and offer receipts (i.e . initial or subsequent receipts ). I also tested how trait indebtedness would relate to acceptors' categorical repayment (i.e. cooperate , cheap - or free-ride), while controlling for expected repayment, using the GEE method with an exchangeable correlation structure. In both the hierarchical regression and GEE I focused only on the 733 instances in which a conditional offer was accepted (N = 703). I included two separate analyses on effects of trait indebtedness on participants' repayment in th e two RTs where they received unconditional offers. I conducted a hierarchical regression examining how trait indebtedness predict s repayment magnitude while controlling for offer receipts ( initial or second ). I also adopted the GEE method to explore how trait indebtedness would relate to unconditional offer acceptors' categorical repayment, while controlling for offer receipts (i.e. initial or subsequent receipts). b) Results The analyses, as detailed in Table 5.17 below offered no indication that trait indebtedness had any significant direct influence on the various decisions Chapter 5 238 (e.g. to help or not to help; the magnitude of transfer; and conditionality etc.) in Trials 1 and 10 (all ps >. 05). Therefore, contrary to the Indebtedness -driven Helping argument, helpfulness (or trustfulness) in Experiment 3 appeared unrelated with indebtedness as a disposition .

Results of the hierarchical regression also offered minimal clear -cut evidence for the hypothesis that dispositional indebtedness undermines under - repayment, despite a trend is shown. Beta coefficients for the three predictors Chapter 5 239 were expected repayment, = .213, t = 5.77, p < .001 ; offer receipts, = .024, t = 0.65, p = .514; and trait indebtedness, = .070, t = 1.91, p = .057. Crucially, the inclusion of trait indebtedness did not bring a significant improvement to the model ( p = .057) . Meanwhile, results of the GEE also revealed no differences ( Wald 2 (2) = 2.11, p = .348) in trait indebtedness, after controlling for expected repayment, among cooperators ( 0.082). In short, the data did not confirm the present (Trait) Indebtedness -driven Repayment hypothesis. Furthermore, the regression analysis examining how trait indebtedness predicts unconditional offer repayment also did not show any significant effect , = -.015, t (256) = -0.25, p = .807. The r esult s of the GEE also offered no evidence ( Wald 2 (2) = 0.034, p = .983) that trait indebtedness differentiated the categorica l repayment decisions among unconditional offer takers. c) Conclusion Overall, the above analyses suggested a total absence of direct effects of trait indebtedness on participants' decision -making throughout Experiment 3. While at present I will not dismiss any potential indirect effects trait indebtedness may have on the present decision variables, it is, however, beyond the scope of the current thesis to examine issues as such. Chapter 5 240 5.5. Discussion The key objective of Experiment 3 entails the scrutiny of a few unexplored domains \u2014which were summari sed by the four unanswered questions \u2014 in Experiments 1 and 2. While these UAQs predominantly concerned the methodological facets (i.e. UAQs 2 to 4), UAQ 1 touched on how state and trait emotions \u2014gratitude and indebtedness in particular \u2014 would be related to cooperativeness and sanctioning within economic games. In so doing, I endeavour to render the present thesis a more all-round and robust investigation of the gratitude (or indebtedness) -prosociality association in the realm of Behavioural Economics . In this section I discuss three key findings at present. They included, a) the fairness -enforcing aspect of cheap -riding (i.e. the norm -enforcement hypothesis, See Sub -section 5.5.1 below); b) the moderating effect of knowledge on recipients' fairness attributions (i.e. would the transparency of helpers' options inspire recipients to quit adopting an 'all -or-nothing' perspective when evaluating fairness? See Sub -section 5.5. 2), and c) how gratitude and indebtedness were related to the display of prosociality at present (i.e. See Sub -section 5.5.3). Sub -section 5.5.4 will conclude the discussion by reviewing some other findings (e.g. whether the single - or both -role design would explain the 'over -generosity' issue) i n relation to the other methodological UAQs. 5.5.1. The Norm -enforcing Role of Cheap -riding The comparison of repayment between Experiments 2 and 3 provided insights on how prevalent cheap -riding is resorted to may depend on whether it could serve a norm -enforcing function . Specifically, analyses of the odds ratios Chapter 5 241 showed that acceptors in a one-off setting (Experiment 2) were less likely to cheap -ride than acceptors in the present iterated context (See Table 5.7). I argued throughout this thesis the princi pal motive for cheap -riding \u2014in this particular context \u2014entails conveying a 'fair but firm', ' cannot be exploited' image of an unfairly treated victim (Komorita et al., 1991; Komorita et al., 1992; Komorita & Parks, 1999), and in so doing the punisher attem pts to curb further fairness infringement by that offender (Ma et al., 2014). This should capture the essence of the current norm -enforcement hypothesis (NEH). Building on this logic, it makes sense that a participant would prefer cheap -riding in a context knowing that his/her 'perpetrator' may have another 'shot' to continue being unkind to other people \u2014that is, a repeated game. Participants in Experiment 3 were explicitly told that it was a multiple -shot experiment, and that everyone would be partnered with a different co-player in each round. By contrast, in Experiment 2 participants were told it was a one- shot game and there were neither explicit instructions nor implications of repeated (or multiple) interactions and partner -switching throughout. Taken together, Experiment 3 should constitute a better platform for cheap -riding that is intended to serve a norm -enforcing purpose. That is because participants knew that their 'perpetrators' (i.e. ungenerous helpers) would have at least another chance to subject others to unfair treatment. On the contrary, in Experiment 2 participants were under an impression that this was the one and only trial and the helpers had no room to continue their 'unfair' streak even if they w ished to. Accordingly, a fairness -enforcing cheap -riding should make more sense in an iterated rather than in a one -shot context. Thus, the present data which showed that cheap -riding was less prevalent in Chapter 5 242 Experiment 2 than in Experiment 3 may symbolise th e participants' capability of selecting the 'right' circumstance to optimi se the norm -enforcing capacity of cheap -riding . I, therefore, interpret this as a partial confirmation of the NEH. While the above suggests that people tended to cheap -ride more in a context in which doing so better serves its immediate purpose, here I particularly delve into how efficacious cheap -riding can be relied upon in implementing normative fairness. Overall, the results (See Sub-section 5.3.3, i.e. testing UAQ #4) indicated that conditional offer givers ( N = 83) who had been ' cheap -rode' would \u2014compared to the ' free-rode' givers \u2014 tend more to give a more generous offer in Trial 10; although the results showed no differences in likelihood for more generosity among the 'cheap -rode' and fully- repaid givers. In addition, cheap -rode' givers were more likely to also partially repay the conditional offers that they accepted during their six ensuing recipient trials. There were, however, no signs of them \u2014compared to the 'fully repaid' and 'free -rode' givers \u2014being more inclined to repay fully or refrain from free - riding (See Table 5.10). That is, being 'cheap -rode' did not incite more trustworthiness or a less blatant breach of normative fair ness, but a 'tit -for-tat' pattern of cheap -riding directed to others \u2014thus the NEH is not fully supported. All in all, while the cross -study comparisons alluded to the notion that people prefer to cheap -ride more in a context in which fairness enforcement should be more feasible (i.e. the iterated game ), analyses of the present repayment's manipulation revealed that being 'cheap -rode' did not incite more eventual fair plays from the victims. This could be understood as participants expecting that their deci sions (i.e. cheap -riding) may have a certain Chapter 5 243 consequence (i.e.to prompt more eventual compliance of the injunctive fairness norm) which did not actually turn out to be the case. 5.5.2. Moderating Effect of Recipients' Knowledge about Helpers' Options on Fairness Attribution, Benefit Appraisal, and Experienced Gratitude One key objective of Experiment 3 involves the analyses of whether the hinted 'threshold' mentality in fairness evaluation in Experiments 1 and 2 will be moderated by the recipients' awareness of helpers' options. Does more unfairness still not count (i.e. UAQ #1)? Or that Relativity should matter as theorise d in the Gratitude Relativity Hypothesis ( GRH ) (Wood et al., 2011)? Both the present psychometric and behavioural evidence were in support of the GRH (Wood et al., 2011). Recipients at present had show n the hypothesi sed graded pattern of emotional ratings towards offers of varying unfairness. Recipients reported considerably more prosocial emotions (e.g. emotional gratitude , a desire to reciprocate etc.) and less disapproval (e.g. annoyance) towards rec eipts of 'fairer' (i.e. unconditional or 'interest -free') offers. Interestingly, as opposed to the literature (e.g. Tsang, 2006b; Watkins et al., 2006) a more salient demand for a return favour (i.e. a 'harsher' repayment clause) at present had triggered i) lower state indebtedness and, ii) t he perceived obligation to repay. In Schaumberg and Flynn's (2009) words, a more unfair offer at present seemed to have undermined both the ' want -to' (i.e. gratitude - inspired) and the ' have -to' (indebtedness -invoked) motives to reciprocate. Aside from the survey ratings, the current behavioural data also challenged the notion that there exists a 'fair versus unfair' threshold \u2014thus more unfairness should not matter once that threshold had been overstepped. First, as recapped in Sub -section 5.3 .2.2 the odds of offer rejections were higher Chapter 5 244 among the more unfair offers (e.g. 25% -, 50% - Interest offers); despite knowing in advance that it is possible to default. Meanwhile, the data from a supplementary Multinomial Logit Model Analyses (See Table 5. 18) further evidenced the impact of conditionality (while controlling for whether the recipients were affected by the 'Partner's Repayment Manipulation (in Trial 1)') on acceptors' categorical repayment of their conditional offers. Table 5.18 Supplementary analysis: Comparison of Repayment by Conditionality vs. Interest -Free 50%-Interest vs. Interest -Free 1. Variable: Categorical Repayment -Repay Partially vs. Odds Ratio 0.22* 1.92* 4.50* Repay 25%- Interest 50%-Interest vs. 25%-Interest (ORs) 2. Variable: Repayment -Repay Partially vs. Odds Ratio 0.42* 0.52* 2.34* Repay ULOR 0.49 0.59 2.39 Note.1 the 50 participants who were unaffected by the partner repayment manipulation (i.e. refused to help or help unconditionally at Trial 1) was coded 'unaffected' in this analysis. LLOR: Lower Limit Odds Ratio; ULOR: Upper Limit Odds Ratio. * denotes th at the 95% Confidence Intervals did not overlap the null value (i.e. OR=1) \u2014suggesting statistical significance ( Szumilas , 2010). Indeed, this supplementary analysis (See Table 5.18) indicated that the odds of acceptors under -repaying (i.e. partial or zero back -transfer) over cooperating (i.e. repay fully) were higher among the 'harsher' offers compared to the 'lenient' ones (e.g. 50% - vs. 25% -Interest and 25% - vs. Interest -Free etc.). Overall, the behavioural evidence suggested that not only were the m ore unfair offers more frequently rejected , they were also more likely to yield a sanctioning response (i.e. repay partly or nothing ) from those who accepted. Taken together, both the in -game survey ratings (i.e. appraisals and emotions) and the actual dec isions (i.e. acceptances and repayment) were in Chapter 5 245 support of the GRH (Wood et al., 2011). Participants reacted both emotionally (e.g. feeling more gratitude , indebtedness etc.) and behaviourally (e.g. repaying despite 'not having to') towards offers of varying extent of normative fairness (or unfairness). I interpret this as a result of recipients being allowed to compute the relative worth of each offer they received (Wood et al., 2011), thanks to the newfound transparency of the helpers' range of alternatives. Any discrepancy in this relative worth (across offers) is subsequently translated into different emotions and displays of prosociality (or the lack thereof ). 5.5.3. Gratitude , Indebtedness , and the present Display of Prosociality In this section , I recap and discuss how gratitude and indebtedness had directly or indirectly contributed to prosociality in the present game. First, the results overall showed that acceptors feeling more gratitude (for the conditional offers) would less likely default on their helpers (by partial or total under - repaying). The magnitude of voluntary backtransfer to unconditional helpers was also regressed on state gratitude. Whil e all these observations were consistent with the Moral Motive Hypothesis (McCullough et al., 2001; McCullough et al., 2008) in that gratitude will undermine endeavours to harm the benefactors, the results, nonetheless, demonstrated that the experience of gratitude would not entirely rule out defaulting as hypothesi sed (i.e. Moral Barometer Hypothesis (McCullough et al., 2001; McCullough et al., 2008)). Indeed, instances of cheap -riding were still preceded by a considerable degree of experienced gratitude (towards one's conditional offer givers). Interestingly, an almost identical pattern of findings emerged for state indebtedness and recipients' trustworthiness. Acceptors who reported feeling more indebted would also more likely cooperate than under -repay (both Chapter 5 246 partially and totally ). Confirming the present Indebtedness -driven reciprocity notion (Schaumberg & Flynn, 2009), state indebtednes s had a) an inverse association with the under -repayment rate of conditional offers; and b) a direct correlation with the voluntary repayment of unconditional offers. Furthermore, echoing the analyses in Chapter 4, the current design features (e.g. double -anonymity and partner -switching) did not encourage the helper vilification as Greenberg and Westcott (1983) suggested as a route via which a recipient can eradicate his/her benefit -triggered indebtedness . Data from the path analysis revealed quite the opposite results: state indebtedness would indirectly promote trustworthiness (i.e. suppress under -repayment) via more fav ourable benefit appraisals. In summary, the findings appeared to challenge the well -documented (e.g. Watkins et al., 2006; Tsang, 2006b) divergence in how gratitude vis-\u00e0-vis indebtedness are related to prosociality \u2014which was replicated in a relatively under -sampled Experiment 1 (N= 49) (See Chapter 3). Participants at present felt less appreciative and indebted upon receipts of increasingly unfair offers, and that both affective states were predictive of trustworthi ness, so as sheer generosity , in a similar fashion under an iterated economic exchange context. Additionally, analyses on whether dispositional gratitude would shape prosociality as suggested in the Social -Cognitive Model of Gratitude (Wood et al. 2008) re vealed insignificant results. Echoing the analysis of Chapter 4, the present investigation again failed to confirm that dispositional gratitude would enhance trustworthiness via the serial mediation (Hayes, 2013) via i) benefit appraisals followed by ii) state gratitude. Chapter 5 247 Finally, analyses on hypotheses in relation to how dispositional indebtedness would foster helping (i.e. Indebtedness -driven Helping) or trustworthiness (i.e. Indebtedness -driven Repayment) again produced null findings (See Sub -section 5.4. 3.2 and Table 5.17). In a separate analysis (See Table 5.9) I showed that dispositional indebtedness was not segregating offer acceptors from the rejectors, even though I also acknowledged that (See Sub - section 5.3.2.2) the present lop -sided acceptor -rejec tor distribution may render this particular analysis unfit to be drawn any conclusions from. Taken together, unlike the state measures, neither dispositional gratitude nor indebtedness was found to have affected participants' crucial decisions as hypothesi sed (See Table 5.1). These seemed to be in line with the key findings in the meta -analysis (See Chapter 2) whereby the display of gratitude -triggered prosociality should depend more on whether the gratified person is feeling grateful at that instant, rathe r than whether or not that said individual is endowed with a grateful character or life orientation (Wood et al., 2010). The current data hinted that this very same line of reasoning may also apply to how indebtedness would be related to prosociality as we ll. 5.5.4. Solutions to other Methodological Unanswered Questions (UAQs) Below (i.e. Sub -sections 5.5.4.1 and 5.5.4.2) I review how the present results would address the two other methodological UAQs. They included, firstly, the UAQ # 2 (See Sub -section 5 .1.2.2) which questioned if the lack of opportunities to play both as helpers and recipients was to blame for the 'over - generosity' issue in Experiments 1 and 2; and secondly, the UAQ # 3 (See Sub - section 5.1.2.3) which inquired if the high rejections (i.e . 35.6%) in Experiment Chapter 5 248 2 were propelled by negative reciprocity (Bolton et al., 1998), or trait indebtedness (Greenberg & Westcott, 1983; Mathews & Shook, 2013). 5.5.4.1. Solution to UAQ #2: Playing Both Roles and Over -generosity Indeed, the analyses had confirmed neither the Golden Rule nor the Reduced Responsibility Hypothesis (Burks et al., 2003). Overall there was no clear -cut evidence to conclude that the present a) both-role, and b) iterated design had enhanced either, i) trustfulness or, ii) overall trustworthiness. Although as discussed in Section 5.5.1 acceptors in Experiment 2 were, compared to Experiment 3, more likely to prefer fully or utterly not repaying than cheap -riding on their offers, the comparison of under -repayment rates (i.e. UR%) in Experiments 2 and 3 revealed no significant differences. Thus, despite the fact that acceptors in Experiments 2 and 3 had adopted different categorical repayment options, such a difference was not translated to the overall measure of trustworthiness (i.e. UR %). All in all, the 'over -generosity' concern in Experiments 1 and 2 appeared to persist despite the present modified design. 5.5.4.2. Solution to UAQ #3: Were the High Rejections in Experiment 2 attributable to Negative Reciprocity or Dispositional Indebtedness? Predictably, the incidence of offer rejections was significantly lower in the present experiment (i.e. 11.9%) than in Experiment 2 (i.e. 35.6%). I attribute such a drastic decline to a modified feature at present \u2014that is, a pre - acceptance noti fication of the non-binding nature of the repayment clause. This new feature should rule out the possibility of recipients rejecting as to express their discontent with the normative unfairness that they were putting up with (See Chapter 4), as they could do so via taking the offers and then not repay. Chapter 5 249 While it is crystal clear that recipients at present should harbour minimal incentives to reject and the data showed exactly that, the important question here is: had this reduced rejections translated to more sanctioning in Experiment 3? Indeed, as discussed above the cross -study comparison had evidenced a higher prevalence of cheap -riding (over cooperating and free - riding) at present compared to Experiment 2. Additionally, the overall incidence of cooperating (over defaulting in gener al) was significantly higher ( p = .022, two-tailed) in Experiment 2 (i.e. 59/ 67.8%) compared to Experiment 3 (i.e. 386/ 703= 54.9%; for conditional offers only), although such a difference in categorical repayment was not translated to the present ove rall index of trustworthiness (i.e. under -repayment %). Taken together, the results hinted that participants did utilise the current set -up to penali se their helpers via defaulting, and more importantly, an overwhelming segment of these defaulting involved cheap - (i.e. 77.9%) rather than free-riding (i.e. 22.1%). Thus, contrary to the convenient speculation that the present recipients refused to reject so they could fully exploit their helpers, they appeared to instead scrap rejections for cheap -riding \u2014wher eby the correctional, 'Just Desert' (Carlsmith et al., 2002) aspect of cheap -riding had been thoroughly discussed in Chapter 4. As a result, the present observed sharp decline in rejections should add substance to the speculation that a large chunk of reje ctions in Experiment 2 may have originated from a desire to penali se unfairness \u2014and in a way confirming the Negative Reciprocity Hypothesis. Additionally, I tested whether dispositional indebtedness will have a role in prompting rejections. The data overall failed to show any signs of dispositionally indebted individuals being more propelled to accept or reject. Chapter 5 250 Impression management (Paulhus, 1991) was also a non -factor in acceptance. The current acceptance decisions seemed to p rimarily hinge on situational parameters such as offer conditionality, as the data indicated that the odds of rejection were evidently lower for offers with a more lenient repayment clause (e.g. 'interest -free'). Nonetheless, the overall rare occurrence of rejections (See Table 5.9) may have limited the scope and the validity of analyses as of why people would bother to reject an offer in the present experiment. 5.6. Implications and Future Directions Overall, Experiment 3 offered a robust response toward the list of unanswered questions (UAQs) from Experiments 1 and 2. While some UAQs remain unresolved, for instance, the overall 'over -generosity' issues emanating from Experiments 1 to 3 and that cheap -riding was not norm -enforcing as expected, the current chapter had complemented Experiment 2's investigations into cheap -riding , and more importantly, the role of gratitude and indebtedness in fostering reciprocity (or restraining sanctioning ) in economic exchanges. In subs-sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 I review two unresolved UAQs and discuss how that could be addressed in future investigations. 5.6.1. Unresolved UAQ 1: Over -generosity: Social Heuristics (Rand et al., 2012; Rand et al., 2014) or t he House Money Effect (Clark, 2002) to blame? The cross -study analyses failed to show that participants under the present iterated and multiple -roles experimental design was more prosocial or profit -maximizing than those of the one-shot, single -role Experiments 1 and 2. Thus, it is conceivable that other facets of Experiments 1 and 2 may account for the observed 'over -cooperativeness'. Chapter 5 251 Rand and associates ( 2014 ) theorise d that human beings developed a social heuristics through numerous day -to-day interactions during which cooperation is inevitable and advantageous . As a result, people acquire a cooperative 'intuitive defaults' (Bear & Rand, 2016; Jordan , Peysakhovich , & Rand, 2014 ; Peysakhovich & Rand, 2016) and may inadvertently let it dictate their d ecision -making in situations where being cooperative is not advantageous (e.g. one -shot, double -blind games like Experiments 1 and 2). Indeed, the above notion which attributes people's reluctance to be pro-self in one -shot games to their inherent cooperat ive instinct had garnered extensive attention from the research community. While Rand and associates (e.g. Rand et al., 2014) had consistently demonstrated the inverse relation between conscious reflection and prosociality in a series of public good games (i.e. PGs hereafter), Verkoeijen and Bouwmeester (2014) failed to replicate this intuitive -cooperation effect in their five studies that were modelled after those of Rand and colleagues'. Additionally, Verkoeijen and Bouwmeeste r (2014) meta -analysed 28 experiments that scrutinised this intuiti ve-cooperation effect in PGs and identified an immaterial \u2014albeit still statistically significant \u2014 overall effect estimate (i.e. Co hen's d = 0.087, R2= 0.0018). Taken together, while theoretically possible it is still not without doubt that intuitive kindness is the bona fide solution to the present unresolved over - generosity problem. Indeed, analyses of Experiments 1 to 3 had not included the decision time measures, nor had I directly manipulated the time allowed for the present decision making \u2014for instance, the ' time-delay versus the time- pressure conditions (Rand et al., 2012). Therefore, a future des ign that Chapter 5 252 incorporates either of these two features should be warranted for a more in - depth investigation into the intuitive -over-cooperation effect. Meanwhile, one shared feature of Experiments 1 to 3 entails the absence of needs for participants to legiti mately 'earn' their endowment. Potential helpers (i.e. P1s) and recipients (i.e. P2s) throughout Experiments 1 to 3 knew and acknowledged that chance rather than competence was what 'entitled' them to the positions (the one to help or to expect help ) they were in. As such, it should be legitimate to argue that P1s in Experiment 1 and 3 were basically playing with the 'House Money' (Clark, 2002) when deciding whether or not and how to help their partners out. On the other hand, P2s were also aware that it wa s not their partners' fault that they 'lost', and therefore it should be fair \u2014at least from an absolute standpoint \u2014that their partners just walked away with their proceeds without sparing them a glance. Furthermore, in Experiments 1 to 3 communications bet ween players were strictly forbidden. P2s were practically 'spoon -fed' the offers without even having to ask (not to mention earning that), unlike Andreoni and Rao's (2011) design in which recipients had to at least send a verbal request for help. Therefor e, it should be reasonable to argue that the P2s in Experiments 1 to 3 were also playing with the house \u2014or at least 'unearned' (Oxoby & Spraggon, 2008) \u2014money. Indeed, the tendency of participants to be more generous or less risk -averse playing with house money is well documented in the behavioural economics literature (e.g. Cherry et al., 2002; Harrison, 2007). By contrast, when endowment has to be earned people would act more in accord with rationality (Oxoby & Spraggon, 2008). In a nu tshell, an alternative avenue to enhance the present resolution of the over -generosity issue entails a slight change in the ways endowment was Chapter 5 253 allocated to the participants. Specifically, instead of the present dice -rolling set- up the experimenter could co nsider having the players partake in a general knowledge quiz, and telling them that a certain criterion (e.g. 8 out of 10) had to be met for any contestants to claim any bonus money. The experimenter could then manipulate the difficulty of these questions . For instance, participants assigned to the 'helper' condition could have a 'cakewalk' to that target, while those assigned to the 'recipient' condition would face way tougher questions. Additionally, a recipient in this modified design could be stipulate d to at least need to make a 'donation request' should they fancy being bailed out. While these new features are not without flaws (e.g. the competence attribution and one's propensity to proactively seek help etc.), they should, however, in combination pr ovide a more valid assessment by taking out one well - documented reason to be overly cooperative: the house money effect. 5.6.2. Unresolved UAQ 2: Cheap -riding not Norm-enforcing \u2014the partner - switching design or the lack of justifications (from the punishers ) to blame? The present analyses highlighted that while cheap -riding would more likely be resorted to in situations where doing so better serves its immediate norm -enforcing purpose (i.e. an iterated instead of a one-shot game); there is no guarantee of ho w well it necessarily works. Nevertheless, I suspected that this lack of efficacy could be liable to the present partner -switching , or the stranger design as coined by Fehr and G\u00e4chter (2000). Contrary to a partner -matching design (Fehr & G \u00e4chte r, 2000) in which participants played an iterated game with the same co -player(s), at present participants were supposedly playing with a different co -player every round \u2014 while staying anonymous throughout. Indeed, results of a meta -analysis on over Chapter 5 254 126 soc ial dilemma experiments (Balliet, Mulder, & Van Lange, 2011) suggested that the punishment -cooperation link was significantly stronger in a partner -matching than both partner -switching and one-shot designs, and that the number of iterations was practically a non -factor in how effective punishment is in inciting cooperativeness. As such, it is conceivable that the current absence of norm -enforcing efficacy of cheap -riding could be ascribed to the partner -switching nature of Experiment 3. Mean while, Xiao and Tan (2014) contended that justification is integral to the proper functioning of any punishment institutions, as people despise those that work in favour of the enforcer's self -gains. Indeed, the failure of a morally unjustified punishment in enhancing cooperation has been well documented in the Trust Game literature (e.g. Fehr & Rockenbach, 2003; Fehr & List, 2004). In Experiments 2 and 3 neither the ' cheap -rode' nor ' free-rode' victims were given any justifications why they were repaid as such. This absence of justifications \u2014together with the fact that the cheap -riding enforcers were still 'profiting' from the exchange \u2014may undermine the legitimacy of the cheap -riding (Xiao & Tan, 2014) and not surprisingly, the efficacy of cheap - riding to get the victims to act more in accord with normative fairness. In a nutshell, I argue that the present analyses of cheap -riding could be complemented with two minor design modifications as discussed in the following. They included, first, an iterated partne r-matching to replace the current partner -switching design. Similar to G \u00fcney and Newell's (2013) procedure, participants would be informed they would play with an anonymous partner for multiple rounds. Meanwhile, the experimenter withholds details on i) the total number of trials (which was already part of the present game's Chapter 5 255 features); and importantly, ii) when participants would swap partners . In so doing a ' cheap -rode' helper in a preceding trial should be more incentivized to make amends for his/her initial 'wrongdoing' by being cooperative in the next, knowing that he/she might encounter the same interactional partner again. Meanwhile, a second recommended adjustment entails the helpers' access to their offer acceptors' post -repayment ratings (that probed into their motives behind their repayment or the lack thereof). Alternatively, similar to Xiao and Tan's (2014) Justification Treatment the punisher \u2014at present a cheap - or free-rider \u2014could be stipulated to give an explanation to the helper why he/she under -repaid. Either of these new features should highlight to the helpers explicitly why\u2014justified or otherwise \u2014their offers were repaid as such. Indeed, data from Xiao and Tan (2014) demonstr ated that when 'punishment is profitable for the enforcer (pp.14)' a justification could render a) a perception of legitimacy in the sanction, and importantly, b) more efficiency of that sanction in promoting prosociality . Meanwhile, Xiao and Tan (2014) al so showed that the need to justify a sanction would confine the enforcer to only penali se people for their misdeed rather than for ulterior reasons. Taken together, I argue that by allowing the defaulters ( cheap - and free-riders inclusive) to account for their non -repayment, or at least making their post-repayment survey responses known to their helpers, should render a more overall legitimate analysis of how cheap -riding could emulate altruistic punishment.

Overview of the Present Thesis Throughout Chapters 2 to 5 a recurring theme was thoroughly examined, that is, how gratitude as a construct would relate to prosociality or sanctioning in a Behavioural Economics context. Every empirical study casts light upon certain elements of the grati tude-prosociality association, with each ensuing experiment providing a follow -up analysis to validate , as well as, to build upon, those particular observations. In particular, while the meta -analysis (i.e. Chapter 2) revealed that the gratitude -prosociali ty link is stronger among studies which examined gratitude as a benefit -triggered (Lambert et al., 2009), transitory affective state , or studies which adopted direct , reciprocal prosociality measure, Experiment 1 (i.e. Chapter 3) built upon that by examining how this gratitude -reciprocity association would be subject to helper intent attribution, and how the injunctive fairness norm (Elster, 2006; Paddock, 2005) could contribute to that and thus shaped recipients' feeling of gratitude (or indebtedness) throughout the episode, and ultimately his/her urge to directly reciprocate. Experiment 2 (i.e. Chapter 4) shifted the spotlight towards recipients' emotional and reciprocal reactio ns towards injunctively unfair (i.e. conditional ) offers (Ma et al., 2014), and tested whether dispositional gratitude would contribute to prosociality (or sanctioning) in this context as predicted by the Social Cognitive Model of Gratitude (i.e. SCMG, Woo d et al., 2008). Meanwhile, Experiment 3 (i.e. Chapter 5) served as a round -up by examining a few unanswered questions (see Chapters 4 and 5) from the two prior studies, via a game with a different design (i.e. an iterated game with role-switching ). Chapter 6 257 Meanwh ile, Experiments 2 and 3 entailed a series of comprehensive follow -up analyses on an interesting while relatively under -researched economic observation from Experiment 1 \u2014 i.e. the cheap -rider problem (Isaac, Schmidtz, & Walker, 1989). While speculations an d theories (e.g. 'Just Deserts' theories of punishment (Carlsmith et al., 2002)) on why people may cheap -ride\u2014instead of free -ride\u2014had been raised, Experiment 2 offered a customi sed and more robust scrutiny over the occurrences and motives behind cheap -riding. Experiment 3 further built on that by examining, i) how cheap - riding could emulate altruistic punishment (Fehr & G\u00e4chter, 2002; Fowler, 2005) as a means to enforce the injunctive fairness norm (i.e. the Norm Enforcement Hypothesis (NEH), See Chapter 5 for details), and importantly, ii) how gratitude and indebtedness would relate to this particular type of defaulting that should make little sense rationality -wise (See Chapter 4 for details). Figure 6.1 below \u2014which illustrates an integrated model derived from the key observations \u2014could offer insights on how the present thesis would add to the gratitude and behavioural economics literature. Detailed discussions in relation to the theoretical and practical significance of the current thesis will, meanwhile, be featured in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 respectively. 6.1. Theoretical Contributions This section discusses at length how this thesis contributes to both the behavioural economics and grati tude literature. Sub -section 6.1.1 features the discussion on how the observations from the three lab studies add to the existing models (e.g. SCMG, Wood et al., 2008). Sub -section 6.1.2 sheds light upon certain novel specific paths generated from the empi rical studies (e.g. how the helper intent will depend upon the injunctive norm), and the subtletiesChapter 6 258 Figure 6.1 Overall Summary Diagram of the Thesis (while incorporating the Social Cognitive Model of Gratitude (Wood et al., 2008) PRESENCE ABSENCE A Graded pattern of intent attributions and emotional reactions toward varying levels of offer fairness Dispositional Gratitude Benefit Appraisal: -Genuine Helpfulness; -Cost to Helpers; -Value of the Benefits Experiment 2: - Conditional Offer Receipts (' Interest -Free ' vs. ' 12.5% -' vs. ' 25%-' vs. '50%- Interest offers'); Experiment 3: - Conditional Offer Receipts (' Interest -Free ' vs. '25%-' vs. ' 50%- Interest offers'); - Unconditional Offer Receipts State Gratitude Helper's Intent Attribution Availability of Information to evaluate (i.e. Knowledge about Helpers' Alternative Options) Chapters 3 to 5 (i.e. Experiments 1 to 3) Computation of relative worth of each offer received (i.e. Relative Rank Model of Gratitude (RRMG ), Wood et al., 2011) 'All-or-Nothing' pattern of fairness attributions (i.e. Unconditional -'Fair' VERSUS Conditional -'Unfair ') Injunctive Norm of Fairness (Elster, 2006) (i.e. what an average 'fair' person should do in situations like this) Chapters 3 and 4 ( i.e. Experiments 1 and 2) Chapters 5 (i.e. Experiment 3) Prosociality/ Cooperativeness Reciprocating Tendencies Actual Repayment Chapters 3 (i.e. Experiment 1) Chapters 4 and 5 (i.e. Experiments 2 and 3) Cheap -riding Cooperating Free -riding Chapter 6 259 as regards some of these paths (e.g. how the use of injunctive norm or the Relative Rank Model of Gratitude (i.e. RRMG, Wood et al., 2011) was indeed dependent on recipient's knowledge about helpers' options). Sub -section 6.1.3 outlines how the present overall observations of cheap -riding would relate to, and therefore builds on, the existing findings on the 'cheap -rider' problem in the public goods game literature (e.g. Isaac et al., 1989; Marks et al ., 2006). 6.1.1. How do the Model and the Current Findings Add to the Literature? While several theories, for example, the Moral Functional Hypotheses of Gratitude (McCullough et al., 2001; McCullough et al., 2008) and the Social Cognitive Model of Gratitu de (SCMG) (Wood et al., 2008), had either hinted or overtly stated that gratitude is predictive of prosociality, the present integrated model (see Figure 6.1) has outlined a complex that underlies the whole gratitude -prosociality association. Particularly, this integrated model incorporates the Theory of Reciprocity (or Fairness) (e.g. Falk & Fischbacher, 2006; Falk et al., 2008) by acknowledging the importance of perceived intent or fairness, and importantly, how this fairness attribution could be subjecte d to manipulation of certain parameters (e.g. knowledge about helpers' behavioural alternatives) and thus elicits varying levels of experienced gratitude which is ultimately translated into direct reciprocation (or sanctioning ) in an economic exchange cont ext. All these observations could be mapped onto the results of the moderator analyses (i.e. Chapter 2) where gratitude is more strongly linked to prosociality when certain parameters were met. These included, (1) state rather than trait gratitude being examined; (2) direct reciprocity instead of indirect or non-reciprocal outcomes being measured; and (3) benefit -triggered instead of generalized gratitude (Lambert et al., 2009) being examined. Chapter 6 260 The present thesis also a ttempted to shed light upon the well - documented (e.g. Schaumberg & Flynn, 2009; Watkins et al., 2006; Tsang, 2006b) divergence in the mechanism via which gratitude and indebtedness facilitate prosociality. While the relatively under -sampled ( N= 49) Experim ent 1 appeared to replicate such a divergence \u2014whereby gratitude rather than indebtedness was found to vary as a function of injunctive (normative) fairness, such a pattern was not replicated in either of the larger samples in Experiments 2 ( N = 87) or 3 ( N = 133). In fact, analyses of Experiment 3 even showed that both states gratitude and indebtedness would relate directly toward injunctive fairness, and both were predictive of subsequent direct reciprocal behaviours (in the forms of trustworthiness or generosity ). Taken together, the results seemed to challenge the prevalent idea in the emotions literature where indebtedness is commonly conceptualized as a negatively - valenced affect that is doomed to haunt cooperation in the long -run (e.g. Greenberg, 1980; Greenberg & Westcott, 1983; Hatfield & Sprecher, 1983), whereas gratitude is expected to invoke and nurture prosociality via an entirely different route (Komter, 2004; Watkins, 2014; Watkins et al., 2006). Additionally, these findings would echo my argume nt in Chapter 2 \u2014where in direct reciprocal exchanges gratitude may also trigger a sense of indebtedness or obligation (Wood et al., 2016), and that both of which should contribute to a desire to return other's prosocial gestures (Schaumberg & Flynn, 2009). Furthermore, as addressed in Chapter 1 the current thesis constitutes the first ever empirical examination of how indebtedness (both as a state or a disposition ) as a psychological construct would mould people's economic decisions. While dispositional indebtedness (along with dispositional Chapter 6 261 gratitude) was not shown to be particularly impactful on participants' current cooperative or retaliatory decisions, potentially due to the power issue (Refer to Section 6.3 for more details), the present data have consi stently demonstrated that indebted recipients did not only feel prompted to reciprocate (i.e. Experiment 1), but also engaged in direct reciprocal behaviours (i.e. Experiment 3) and restrained sanctioning behaviours, even when the helpers had stated 'upfront' that there was no need to repay (i.e. unconditional offer receipts, Experiment 3). All in all, the present thesis suggests that th e (state) indebtedness - (direct) reciprocity link was robust to a range of experimental manipulations (i.e. one-shot vs. iterated , single - vs. multiple - roles, fair vs. unfair offers), and hence should serve as a starting point for any future analyses on th e role of indebtedness in the realm of economic exchanges. 6.1.2. Subtleties of Specific Paths in the Above Integrated Model (Figure 6.1) As suggested above the present integrated model is not without its subtleties. This section features a closer scrutiny of the two 'plot twists' of the model \u2014one being the 1) moderating effect of recipients' knowledge of helpers' options on the fairness per ception and accordingly benefit appraisal (i.e. Sub -section 6.1.2.1), with the other being 2) how cheap -riding (which is defined and discussed in the following Sub -section 6.1.2.2) would serve its fairness -enforcing purpose differently in a one-shot (i.e. Experiment 2) versus an iterated , partner -switching (i.e. Experiment 3) interactional context. 6.1.2.1 Moderating Effect of Recipients' Knowledge about Helpers' Options on Fairness Attribution, Benefit Appraisal, and Experienced Gratitude First, as ill ustrated in Figure 6.2 the path between 'Helper Intent Attribution' and 'Benefit Appraisal' is dependent upon the recipients' Chapter 6 262 knowledge about the helpers' list of alternative options. When such knowledge is absent or denied (Experiments 1 and 2) people wer e inclined to rely on the injunctive fairness norm \u2014which delineates what an average fair person is expected do in a given situation (Elster, 2006; Paddock, 2005) \u2014to guide their helper's intent attributions (Ma et al., 2014). Analyses in Chapters 3 and 4 hinted that such a reliance on injunctive normative fairness appeared to drive recipients to adopt an all-or-nothing , 'threshold' mentality in fairness evaluation. Recipients only attended to whether helpers played fair from a normative standpoint (i.e. to s hare their unearned resources equally with others (Frey & Bohnet, 1995) by helping unconditionally ), and when the helpers chose not to do so (i.e. to impose a 'helping' fee via donating conditionally ) the recipients did not show incremental negativity (or decreasing positivity) toward a more injunctively unfair arrangement (e.g. a 50%-Interest versus an Interest -Free offer). See Chapters 3 and 4 for more in -depth discussions . Figure 6.2 Extracts of the Present Overall Summary D iagram (Figure 6.1) A Graded pattern of intent attributions and emotional reactions toward varying levels of offer fairness 'All-or-Nothing' / Threshold Perspective of Fairness Attributions (i.e. Unconditional -'Fair' versus Conditional -'Unfair ') Computation of Relative worth of each offer received (i.e. Gratitude Relativity Hypothesis (GRH), Wood et al., 2011) Injunctive Norm of Fairness (Elster, 2006 ; Paddock, 2005 ) (i.e. what an average 'fair' person 'ought to' do in situations like this) Benefit Appraisal: -Genuine Helpfulness; -Cost to Helpers; -Value of the Benefits Helper's Intent Attribution State Gratitude PRESENCE (i.e. Experiment 3) ABSENCE (i.e. Experiments 1 and 2) Availability of Information to evaluate (i.e. knowledge about Helpers' Alternative Options) Chapter 6 263 Consequently, recipients who were helped fairly (i.e. unconditionally ) tended to evaluate their offers in a more positive fashion, which then led to more experienced gratitude and ultimately, increased prosocial intention (Experiment 1). In contrast, recipients who were treated unfairly (i.e. helped conditionally )\u2014albeit in varying extent (i.e. different 'taxed' offers) \u2014 did not differ in their benefit appraisal, gratitude , or actual repayment (Experiment 2). How ever, analyses of Experiment 3 revealed a very different pattern of results once recipients were no longer unaware of how differently their helpers could have treated them (i.e. access to helpers' alternative in -game options). Both the psychometric (i.e. s urvey ratings) and behavioural (i.e. acceptances and repayment) evidence were in support of the Gratitude Relativity Hypothesis (GRH) \u2014in which Wood et al. (2011) theorise d that people's perception of and gratitude towards a favour should be a function of t hat favour's relative worth : how that favour compares against the others. As a result, this knowledge on how helpers could have acted nicer or nastier (Experiment 3) should permit the recipients' computation of how their actual receipts would 'rank' amon g those 'could -have ' receipts (Wood et al., 2011). These 'rankings' were indeed translated into 1) a graded pattern of both benefit appraisal and gratitude (so as indebtedness ) toward the offers of varying conditionalities (or normative fairness), and impo rtantly, 2) fewer rejections of and defaulting (i.e. cheap - and free-riding inclusive) on the fairer (i.e. the unconditional and those 'low -tax' offers) offers (See Chapter 5). 6.1.2.2. When to Cheap -ride? And How Reliable could Cheap -riding be in emulating Altruistic Punishment (i.e. Norm -Enforcement Hypothesis)? Chapter 6 264 Another subtlety of the present integrated model would involve the other main focus of this thesis \u2014i.e. cheap -riding , which was operationalized at present as a recipient's partial repayment of an accepted , conditional offer. The analyses of cheap -riding became of interest when data of Experiment 1 revealed that a sizeable (i.e. 38.1%) proportion of conditional offer acceptors opted to just under -repay , instead of dodging the repayme nt in its entirety (defined as 'free -riding' at present), upon the reali sation that the 'repayment clauses' that they previously agreed to was indeed not binding (See Chapter 3). Importantly, while cheap -riding was consistently observed across Experiments 1 to 3 it is interesting to notice that people are more likely to cheap -ride in an iterated , partner -switching (Experiment 3) than in a one-off (Experiment 2) exchange setting (Refer to Sub-section 5.3.1.2, Chapter 5 for the detailed analyses). I interpret ed this as a partial confirmation of the Norm - enforcement Hypothesis (NEH), which draws parallels between cheap -riding and altruistic punishment in safeguarding cooperation in the long -run. I argued throughout this thesis that one principal motivation of cheap - riding at present should entail the communication of an unfairly treated recipient's 'fair but firm', ' cannot be exploited' image ( Komorita et al., 1992; Komorita & Parks, 1999) toward the helper, and in so doing the cheap -rider strives to prevent th at helper from by being ungenerous to other people, and therefore breaching the fairness norm once again (i.e. NEH) (Ma et al., 2014). Hence, it makes perfect sense for a fairness -enforcing cheap -rider to cheap - ride more in a repeated , partner -switching context during which doing so should better serve its correctional purpose, as an ungenerous helper in an iterated game should have more chances (i.e. the upcoming trials) to continue Chapter 6 265 to treat others unfairly . In contrast, Experiment 2 should be less of a breeding ground for any norm -enforcing cheap -riding, as its one -shot nature should put any prospective cheap -riders under the impression that those unfair helpers could not carry on violating normative fairne ss even if they wanted to. Thus, cheap -riding in Experiment 2 would understandably be less prevalent that of Experiment 3, and thereby offering some confirmation to the NEH . Nonetheless, analyses of Experiment 3 offered minimal evidence that being cheap -rode would give rise to more subsequent fair plays in subsequent trials. Overall, the data showed that 'cheap -rode' helpers (in Trial 1) were more likely to also partially repay the conditional offers that they later on accepted. There were, however, neither signs of these 'cheap -rode' victims being more inclined to1) repay fully (i.e. cooperate), nor 2) to abstain from free-riding on others \u2014than helpers whose initial conditional offers (in Trial 1) were either fully repaid or not repaid , thus in a way challe nging the NEH . Taken together, while participants seemed capable of finding the 'optimal' circumstance to cheap -ride (i.e. 'preference' to cheap -ride in an iterated instead of one-off context), there is, nevertheless, no guarantee of how efficacious cheap -riding could be in maintaining normative fairness. I interpret these as the epitome of participants' belief that their decisions may have a consequence that did not turn out to be the case. (See Chapter 5 for more discussions on how Experiment 3's partner -switching design may account for the lack of norm -enforcing effect by the 'cheap -riding' manipulation) 6.1.3. Cheap -riding at Present and Cheap -riding in the Wider Literature Despite being an overall scarcely researched topic cheap -riding has been explored in the Public Goods Game (e.g. Bchir & Willinger, 2013; Chapter 6 266 Rondeau, Schulze, & Poe, 1999), and even in the International Relations (e.g. Borcherding , 1981; Oneal, 1990; Thompson, 1987) and the Religiosity Study (e.g. Olson & Perl, 2005) literature. This implies that cheap -riding is far from just an experimental artefact which bears zero ecological validity or generalisability across various research domains. It is, therefore, important t o discuss how the present observations on cheap -riding would relate to those in the wider literature. However, since papers which discussed cheap -riding in an International Relations context are mostly not experimentally -based (e.g. Thompson's (1987) analysis on how the NATO allies had 'cheap -rode' on the Americans by contributing significantly less in fending off the military aggression of the Soviet Union), therefore this section will highlight how the present observations on cheap -riding would compare against, and accordingly add to, the existing empirical findings in the Public Goods Game literature. 6.1.3.1. Operationalizing Cheap -riding in the Public Goods Games literature Several experimental economists (e.g. Bchir & W illinger, 2013; Isaac et al., 1989; Rondeau et al., 1999) had adopted a variant of the classic Public Goods Game (PG) to investigate cheap -riding . Contrary to classic PG in which people who contribute nothing can still claim a share of the resources (as lo ng as the provision point is reached), in this modified game players who refused to contribute a 'membership fee' are prohibited from taking a share (Bchir & Willinger, 2013). Thus, the ' cheap -rider ' problem is defined in this context as the 'unequal distribution of contributions (pp.223)' (Isaac et al., 1989) \u2014which is exemplified by someone contributing merely the 'membership fee' with the intention to exploit his/her groupmates' above (Asch et al., 2013; Mark s et al., 2006; Thompson, 1987). Chapter 6 267 6.1.3.2. Contrasting Cheap -riding at present and that in the PG Literature The above conceptualisation of cheap -riding does not deviate from that of several other researchers (e.g. Krishnamurthy, 2000; Olson & Perl, 2005; Stigler, 1974), and is indeed not at odds with how cheap -riding was referred to at present \u2014both of which concern the exploitations of others' contributions amidst the cheap -riders' own non-zero contributions . However, how cheap - riding was examined in the PG literature (e.g. Bchir & Willinger, 2013; Isaac et al., 1989) seemed quite different from what I did in the present thesis. First, as addressed above this point -provision PG (Bchir & Willinger, 2013; Mar ks et al., 2006) should categorically rule out free-riding , as it is stipulated a priori that non -contributors would be ineligible to acquire any bonuses even if the group's contribution exceeds the provision point. As such, the only 'legitimate' defaultin g option in such a context is cheap -riding (i.e. to just pay the membership fee). This is clearly different from the set -up of Experiments 1 to 3 in which offer acceptors were allowed to decide whether to pay up in full ('cooperate'), partially ('cheap -ride'), or nothing ('free -ride'). Additionally, there is an element of risk associated with cheap -riding in the Point -provision PG. This is particular ly true in a ' No-Refund ' scenario (Bchir & Willinger, 2013) in which participants would 'lose their contributions in the event of provision failures (pp.27)'. Indeed, even in a 'Full -Refund' context a cheap -rider may still incur the risk of his/her 'success' to cheap -ride on oth ers thanks to the potential provision failures. That is, being able to only retrieve his/her membership fee should be indicative of a failed endeavour to piggyback on someone else's high contributions. Needless to say, this risk is further complicated by B chir and Willinger's (2013) direct manipulations of Chapter 6 268 both 1) the provision thresholds and 2) the membership fees (e.g. 'Low -' versus 'Medium -' versus 'High -Threshold (Membership Fee)' conditions). In comparison, defaulting in general ( cheap - and free-ridin g inclusive) in the present experimental set -up appears highly 'risk -free'. Offer acceptors in Experiment 1 to 3 were aware of their bonus money (i.e. helpers' conditional transfer) prior to deciding whether they would default. Thus there should not be any risk in relation to 1) cheap -riders being denied any monetary payoffs at the end, or 2) cheap -riding not being impactful at all. Meanwhile, the double - blinded , one-shot nature of Experiments 1 and 2 should shield both the cheap - and free-riders from any retribution. Additionally, the partner -switching nature of Experiment 3 should offer assurance to the prospective cheap - and free- riders in Experiment 3 about the absence of repercussions of under -repaymen t. 6.1.3.3. Cheap -riding at Present and C heap -riding in the PG Literature Taken together, the present thesis should offer new perspectives to the Point -provision PG literature in relation to cheap -riding in a two crucial aspects. First, the present experiments added back the option to 'free -ride' (i.e. zero contribution) which is essentially forbidden in the abovementioned PGs (e.g. Bchir & Willigner, 2013; Marks et al., 2006). Not only would this re - addition 1) enable a more refined (or possibly less inflated ) measure of one's cheap -riding decision \u2014as cheap -riders at present need to also resist the temptations to default in its entirety, it also 2) permits the present dissociation between the mentality of the cheap -riders , co-operators and the free-riders (See Chapter 4). Apart from such a psychological profiling which is, to my knowledge, yet to be examined in the literature, analyses of Experiment 3 further underlined the segregation between cheap - and free-riding in terms of Chapter 6 269 how being ' cheap - rode' (in Trial 1), as opposed to being ' free-rode' (in Trial 1), would elicit a different pattern of decisions (i.e. repayment in the Recipient Trials and willingness to help in Trial 10) in the later trials (See Chapter 5). Furthermore, as addressed above (i.e. Sub -section 6.1.3.2) the present investigation (i.e. Experiments 1 to 3) removed the risk element which is evident (and even directly manipulated) in Bchir and Willinger (2013). Hence, I argue that the cheap -riding examined at present should be more reflective of personal preferences rather t han a rational decision following one's 'risk assessment'. As addressed in the Dual -process framework ( Dijksterhuis & Nordgren, 2006 ; Kahneman, 2011) System 1 is characterised by susceptibility toward emotions , whereas System 2 epitomises rationality and reasoning (Kahneman & Frederick, 2007). Considering that the recurrent theme of this thesis primarily concerns how economic cooperation is susceptible to emotions in gratitude and indebtedness (i.e. System 1), the present cheap -riding measure which took aw ay the risk assessment (i.e. System 2) part should on the whole add to the legitimacy and validity of the experiments. 6.2. Practical Contributions While there is no denying that the present thesis is predominately theoretically driven, there are two main practical implications to be derived from the key findings. They included implication on, a) how practitioners of Gratitude Interventions (i.e. GIs hereafter) could modify the existing regime to boost its efficacy in promoting prosociality (i.e. Sub-section 6.2.1), and b) the observed under -contribution of child support by the non -custodial 'paying' parents (Allbeson, 2016; Savage, 2015) in Sub -section 6.2.2). 6.2.1. The Meta -analysis (Chapter 2) and Gratitude Interventions (GI) Chapter 6 270 The classic, quintessential GI was originated in studies by Emmons and McCullough (2003) and Watkins et al. (2003) during which participants (or trainees ) were instructed to recall and write about a few gratitude -inducing events that occurred in their rece nt past. For example, participants in Watkins et al.'s (2003) Gratitude condition were asked to recall and write about things that they did over the previous summer that they felt grateful for, whereas trainees assigned to the Control condition would simpl y list things that they did not manage to do during that very same designated period. Nonetheless, in their recently published meta -analysis Davis et al. (2016) had questioned the efficacy of these typical GI practices in enhancing trainees' well -beings. Their results generally failed to confirm that GI could consistently outperform either the control (i.e. measurement -only), or the alternative activities (e.g. listing of daily hassles, Emmons and McCullough, 2003) conditions. Meanwhile, via their qualitat ive review Wood et al. (2010) had also weighed in with their scepticism about the effectiveness of the existing GI regime. While neither Davis et al. (2016) nor Wood et al. (2010) had specifically critiqued the existing GI's efficacy in promoting prosocial ity, the present suggested modifications \u2014which will be briefly discussed below \u2014 should still be worth the practitioners' considerations, thanks to the relative ease of implementing such and the theoretical bases behind. Building on the key findings of the moderator analyses (See Chapter 2 for details), I suggested that practitioners of existing GI practices (e.g. 'Grateful Essay' training, Watkins et al., 2003) could have their trainees write about an experience of 1) bei ng generously treated by a particular person (i.e. benefit -triggered (Lambert et al., 2009) gratitude affect ), and 2) how the Chapter 6 271 trainees either actually helped, or intended to help that, that particular benefactor back (i.e. direct reciprocity). Trainees cou ld also be instructed to think about 3) how their good deeds (e.g. to return others' benevolence) might draw generosity from others when they need help (i.e. 'downstream' indirect reciprocity, Nowak and Roch, 2007), or 4) how their feelings of gratitude for someone's kindness could propel them to contribute to others' well -being (i.e. 'upstream' indirect reciprocity, Nowak and Roch, 2007). Overall, the meta - analysis should serve to inform and advise the GI practitioners on ways to optimi se its efficacy amid st doubts raised in the research community (e.g. Davis et al., 2016; Renshaw & Olinger -Steeves, 2016; Wood et al., 2010). 6.2.2. The Psychology of those Child Maintenance Under -contributors Additionally, the present analyses on the cheap -riders' unique psychological profiling (See Chapter 4) should have implications on the phenomenon of non -custodial parents under -contributing (but not outright escaping) their child support obligations. Since each paying parent's contribution is, according to the Child Supp ort Agency (i.e. CSA hereafter), tailored to his/her financial situation \u2014hence removing any concerns about affordability, coupled with the public knowledge on the CSA's inefficiency in retrieving the maintenance arrears (Savage, 2007) \u2014i.e., the absence of repercussions for not paying, I, therefore, drew parallel between these child support under -payments and the observed cheap -riding in Experiments 1 to 3. Particularly, in Chapter 4 I speculated that those under -contributing parents may have experienced a similar emotional conundrum just like the cheap -riders in Experiment 2. While their deliberate under -repayment may be indicative of these paying parents' intent to show retributions against their Chapter 6 272 exes for their losses of custody (or for the split) (Stahly, 2000), they were mindful of not going overboard thus crossed the line of a ' Just Desert ' (Moore, 1997; Wenzel & Thielmann, 2006). They may also contribute partially hoping to lessen their sense of guilt over their failure to provide their children with a loving family (Arditti, 1992; Braver et al., 1993) \u2014whereby guilt aversion is a defining attribute of Experienced Warm-Glow (Ferguson & Flynn, 2016). Meanwhile, analyses of Experiment 3(i.e. Chapter 5) indicated that cheap -riding is more likely resorted to in an iterated rather than a one-off exchange context. This could be mapped onto the situation in which a divorced or split couple might still contin ue to interact with one another for their children's sake. Nonetheless, results of Experiment 3 further illustrated that despite the more prevalent attempts to cheap -ride in an iterated interactional context, there was no evidence suggesting that cheap -riding could be relied on to enforce fairness (or subsequent cooperativeness). In other words, the present data hinted that any under -contributors who wish to use their partial under - payment to serve a correctional purpose might wish to think twice about that . 6.3. Caveats While I had outlined \u2014in every preceding empirical chapter \u2014the shortcomings or limitations that pertains to each individual chapter, in this section I intend to shed light on four recurring methodological concerns of the three present experiments. The following sub -sections (i.e. 6.3.1 to 6.3.4) will also entail discussions on, (i) what have been done at present to address these issues (i.e. Sub -section 6.3.1), or (ii) alternative measures to be taken in t he future as to properly tackle each of these concerns (i.e. 6.3.2 to 6.3.4). Chapter 6 273 6.3.1. Statistical Power and the Null Findings on the Trait -Prosociality links One major methodological limitation of Experiments 1 to 3 concerns the absence of any a-priori power analyses to determine the minimum required sample sizes (N) to detect the hypothesi sed effects ( Everitt , 2002). This may account for the present list of insignificant findings \u2014throughout Experiments 2 to 3 \u2014as regards the link between dispositional gratitude (and indebtedness) and prosociality (or the absence of sanctioning ). To examine whether insufficient Ns were indeed to blame for the null findings I conducted a post-hoc power analysis using the effect estimates of the trait gratitude -prosociali ty link from the meta -analysis (i.e., r (5,988) = 0.248, p & Lang, 2009; Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007) was used to carry out this analysis. The results revealed that with power equals 0.80, a total N of 125 would be warranted for the effect (i.e. r = 0.248) to be significant at p .05 (two-tailed ). While the actual Ns of both Experiments 2 ( N = 135) and 3 ( N = 133) may have exceeded the suggested N of 125, it should be noted that in Experiment 2 only 87 data points \u2014thanks to the high rate of rejections ( N = 48) \u2014were used to examine how dispositional gratitude was related to participants' trustworthiness . As a result, it is conceivable that the list of insignificant findings \u2014especially on the trait-prosociality associations \u2014of Experiment 2 could be due to the insufficient N; while Experiment 3 appeared reasonab ly powered despite the fact that a similar pattern of null findings were still observed (See Chapter 5 for details). I also tested if Experiments 1 to 3 were adequately powered to examine the state gratitude -prosociality association. A similar power analy sis, while Chapter 6 274 adopting the effect estimates of the state gratitude -prosociality link from the meta -analysis (i.e., r (14,206) = 0.393, p <.001 (two -tailed); see Chapter 2), was carried out using G*Power (Faul et al., 200 9; Faul et al., 200 7). The results showed that with power equals 0.80, a total N of 48 would be warranted for the effect (i.e. r = 0.393) to be significant at p .05 (two-tailed ). Hence, the present three empirical studies (i.e. N = 49 for Experiment 1, N = 87 for Experiment 2; and N = 133 for Experiment 3) should be sufficiently powered to detect the association between state gratitude and prosociality . 6.3.2. Over -reliance on Offer Provisions as the Current Gratitude Induction Throughout Experiments 1 to 3 I relied solely upon the provision of a financial benefit (i.e. conditional or unconditional offers) to induce recipients' momentary feelings of gratitude (or indebtedness ). Leung (2011) contended the logic behind was that sin ce contributing in an anonymous game setting involves i) sacrificing self -interest and ii) running the risk of being taken advantage of, hence the recipients would be inclined to think of those contributions as a token of benevolence from the givers \u2014which accordingly elicits the former's feeling of appreciation toward the latter (Wood et al., 2011). However, unlike a classic Public Goods game (i.e. PG hereafter) where Leung (2011) based her above argument on, a contribution in the present experimental set -ups is clearly different from that in a PG in several aspects. First, a conditional offer (especially the offers with high surcharge, e.g. the 25% - or 50% -Interest ones) at present is hardly indicative of the helper's sacrifice of self -gains. Although reci pients in Experiments 3 might perceive their helpers to have incurred a default risk making an offer, the same could barely apply to Experiments 1 and 2. Indeed, I suggested that the implied Chapter 6 275 binding nature may account for why recipients (in particular Expe riment 2) may have instead utilised their options to accept or reject as the avenue to vent out their frustrations toward their helpers (See Chapter 4 for details). Thus, there is no reason to believe that a recipient in Experiments 1 or 2 would feel that his/her conditional offer giver would have incurred any risk for such a quasi -prosocial gesture. All in all, the above suggests that it might be arbitrary, or even erroneous, to take it for granted that an offer provision under the present gaming parameter s would constitute a legitimate gratitude (or indebtedness ) induction as Leung (2011) did in the context of the PGs. Hence, a future investigation may consider including a specific gratitude induction session in the form of a cover task prior to the economic game in which prosociality or cooperation is measured (e.g. Bartlett et al., 2012; Desteno et al., 2010; Tsang et al., 2012). For instance, Desteno et al. (2010) had participants undertook a computerized word perception task \u2014 during w hich they would encounter a 'technical failure' only to be then 'resolved' by the confederates (i.e. the ' Gratitude Manipulation ', Study 1 to 3, Bartlett & Desteno, 2006) \u2014prior to partaking in a Give -Some Dilemma Game (Nelissen et al., 2007; Parise et al., 1999 ) in which cooperation was examined. 6.3.3. Concerns with Playing with Real versus Simulated Counterparts Aside from Experiment 1 during which participants actually played with one another, participants of Experiments 2 and 3 were indeed interacting with a set of pre-programmed responses as opposed to real persons. While it is not uncommon to administer trust games with simulated instead of real counterparts (e.g. Evans & Revelle, 2008; Johansson -Stenman et al., 2009), Mislin and associates (Bottom, H olloway, Miller, Mislin, & Whitford, 2006; Chapter 6 276 Johnson & Mislin, 2011) noted that belief about playing with a computer (vis - \u00e0-vis a real person) should give rise to different in -game decision -making. In particular, Johnson and Mislin (2011) underlined that \u2014via their meta -analysis over 162 Trust Games \u2014people tended to be more trustful when they were convinced that they were playing with real persons, although the authors did not examine whether this belief would also influence people's trustworthiness . While in Experiments 1 to 3 I had not specifically probed into participants' beliefs about whether they were playing with real persons, there were indeed occasional post-experiment inquiries or even doubts expressed in relation to the 'authenticity' of one 's exchange 'partners'. As such, in any future investigations the experimenter may consider adopting Experiment 1's (random) partner -matching design, but meanwhile maintaining the control over certain key parameters (e.g. i) whether or not, and ii) what, o ffers are given) just like Experiments 2 and 3. For example, similar to Experiment 1 the experimenter might stipulate a recipient to wait his/her turn while the partner is taking the time necessary to decide, thus hinting to the former that the whole episo de is not simulated . In the meantime, while both the partnering and waiting may be real, participants may still be shown the indeed pre -determined 'partner's decisions' \u2014just like what was done in Experiments 2 and 3. 6.3.4. Issues with the Forced -choice Re payment (i.e. Experiments 2 and 3) Figure 6.3. The Forced -choice Repayment Screen in Experiments 2 and 3 Chapter 6 277 One additional recurring methodological concern involves the forced - choice entries of participants' repayment in Experiments 2 and 3. Offer acceptors in these two experiments were cornered into making a selection out of whether to 1) repay 'the whole of the agreed repayment' (i.e. Cooperation ); 2) repay ' some of the agreed amoun t' (i.e. Cheap -riding ), or to 3) repay 'nothing at all' (i.e. Free -riding ) (See Figure 6.3).Participants who chose to cheap -ride were then instructed to indicate their repayment (See Figure 6.4). Figure 6.4 Follow -up Entry Screen for Acceptors who Partially Repaid While such an explicit segregation may have eased the categorization based on the participants' repayment, it may also give rise to the 'Response Effect': whereby respondents may have relied upon the given response sets to guide their pre ferences or decisions (see Feldman, 1989; Zaller and Feldman, 1992). In other words, such an explicit mention of the available repayment avenues might have inadvertently swayed the participants toward repaying in a particular fashion. Therefore, it may be advisable for any future replications to replace the current forced -choice entry with a free-entry measure. As illustrated in Figure 6.5, the experimenter might just leave it open to the participants to freely key in how much they intend to give back to the helpers. Figure 6.5 The ' Free -Entry' Repayment Measure as suggested 6.4. Conclusion The current thesis primarily concerns the scrutiny over the gratitude - prosociality association in an economic exchange context. Via the meta - Chapter 6 278 analysis (i.e. Chapter 2) and three empirical studies (i.e. Chapters 3 to 5) in the form of economic games, the results overall confirmed the role of state gratitude in facilitating economic cooperation in addition to restraining sanctioning . Crucially, the present thesis helped to fill a gap in the literature by combining Psychometrics (i.e. measurement of personality and attitudes via various surveys) and Experimental Economics (i.e. the use of economic games) in the analyses of how gratitude , and a similar benefit -triggered emotion in indebtedness , would predict people's subsequent economic decisions. Using both the single -role, one-shot (Experiments 1 and 2) and multiple -role, iterated (Experiment 3) game designs the present thesis also shed light upon an economic phenomenon which has both reality and theoretical implications \u2014 that is, cheap -riding . While the present analyses failed to indicate any associations between gratitude (or indebtedness ) and cheap -riding in particular, the results had nonetheless demonstrated the unique psychological profiling of people who still chose to cheap -ride when they could have 'free -rode' instead. The data also partially acknowledged a norm -enforcing, functional aspect of cheap -riding , although its efficacy in fairness enforcement would warrant confirmation in future related investigations. All in all, I sincerely hope that my thesis could inspire any prospective investigators to carry on their endeavours to co ntribute to the understanding of the prosocial side of gratitude . I also hope that my thesis could encourage further efforts into the study in relation to the role of indebtedness \u2014as a psychological construct \u2014in economic exchanges.References 279 References Abel, A.

In this game there is a bonus threshold of 200 points, i.e. you will be entitled to a bonus (in addition to your \u00a32 -inconvenience allowance) only if you manage to hit 200 points (or above). Each point above the threshold (200 points) is worth 1p in addition to the bas ic bonus \u00a32. For example, if your final score is 300 points, the total bonus for you will be: Basic bonus for reaching 200 points: \u00a32 + Extra bonus: (300 -200)* 1p= \u00a3 1 Total \u00a3 3 The maximum points you can get is 350, meaning that you could at most end up w ith a bonus of \u00a33.50 (\u00a32 -basic bonus+150*1p) In this game you will be asked to roll a fair die once, and afterwards enter the number you get to the computer. The system will then generate a CHANGE in your score based on the number you get out of the die -rolling. Dependent on your die - rolling results, there are SIX possible changes could be brought to your final scores, namely: i) -50, ii) Zero change, iii) +50, iv) +100, v) +150, vi) +200. Please note that a large number rolled does not necessarily mean a m ore favourable change and vice versa. Instead, the level of your final bonus is jointly determined by WHAT YOU AND THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS HAVE GOT; in a way that the RARER number you get relative to others, the MORE FAVOURABLE change in your score. For ins tance, If there are 20 players and you roll '1' and five others roll '2', another five people roll '3', four people get a '5' and five others roll '6', you'll get the most bonus because you had the rarest number. In this game, everyone has a partner. Nev ertheless, neither joint effort nor competition with your partner will be required to capture the bonus. You and your partner are NOT IDENTIFIABLE to each other and will remain anonymous. The payoff of yours and your partner's will be shown on -screen short ly after you key in the number you get after rolling the die. Please note that in this gaming session partners interact with one another and they will at times take turn to make decisions. As a result, you will see a couple of waiting screens while your pa rtner is making his/her decision. A few waiting screens could last for 5 -6 minutes, depending on how many decisions your partner is asked to make. Similarly, while you are asked to make a series of decisions, it will be your partners' turn to be shown the waiting screen . Appendices 346 Appendix 5.

Opening (All participants) Each of you is given 150 points at the beginning of this game. In this game there is a bonus threshold of 200 points, i.e. you will be entitled to a bonus (in addition to your \u00a32 -inconvenience allowance) only if you manage to hit 200 points (or above). Each point you get will be equivalent to 1p, if and only if your final score is at or above the threshold 200 points. For example, if your final score is 300 points, the total bonus for you will be 300 Pence, i.e. \u00a33, as you manage to make the threshold. However, a final score of 150 (or any scores below 200) would yield you ZERO Bonus as you fail to reach the threshold . The maximum points you can attain is 350, meaning that you could at most end up with a Bonus of 350 Pence, i.e. \u00a33 .50. In this game you will be asked to roll a fair die once, and afterwards enter the number you get to the computer . The system will then generate a CHANGE in your score based on the number you get out of the die-rolling. Dependent on your die -rolling res ults, there are SIX possible changes could be brought to your final scores, namely: i) -50, ii) Zero change, iii) +50, iv) +100, v) +150, vi) +200. Please note that a large number rolled DOES NOT NECESSARILY GUARANTEE a more favourable change and vice vers a. Instead, the level of your final bonus is the outcome of the system's RANDOM assignment. The system would assign at random ONE of the SIX abovementioned outcomes to ONE of the SIX numbers on the die. That is, there is an equal opportunity for you to achieve either of the six abovementioned possible changes. In this game, each of you would play alongside a partner. Please be reminded that NEITHER 1. Joint Effort, NOR 2. Competition, with partners will be necessary for each of you to secure the bonus. You and your partner are NOT IDENTIFIABLE to one another and will remain anonymous throughout this study. Throughout this gaming session you and your partner w ould take turn to make decisions that might influence each other's Final Payoffs. Owing to the interactive nature of this game, you will see several waiting screens as your partner is making his/her decision . Certain waiting screens could at most last for FIVE to SIX minutes, depending on how many decisions your partner has to make . Likewise, while you are asked to make a series of decisions, it will be your partner's turn to be shown the waiting screens. Appendices 360 Appendix 6.

On-screen Instructions for Experiment 3 Example: A Participant who i) was 'Cheap -rode' (Repayment Manipulation) in Trial 1 (First Helper Trial) and ii) had accepted and cheap -rode on his/her '25% -Interest' offer in Trial 2 (1st Recipient Trial). I. Opening (All participants) Aim of the Game 1) Try to win as many 'bonus points' as you can in each trial. There are multiple trials in this experiment; 2) There will be a lottery draw at the end of the experiment, and one of you will have a chance to win a cash prize (at most \u00a335); 3) One of you will be randomly picked as the winner, and for that person one trial they played will be randomly chosen and they will be paid on the basis of that trial; 4) How big the prize money is will depend on the person's performance on that randomly chosen trial, i.e. the 'Jackpot Trial' ; 5) Therefore, treat all trials as though they are real. Rules of the Game 1) To begin with each of you will be given 150 'Bonus Points'. There is a bonus threshold of 200 points you hav e to reach to stand a chance to win a cash prize. Only if you can attain 200 points or above will you have the chance to be entered into the lottery to win. Each point you get is worth 10p, only if your final bonus points are at or above the threshold 200 points will you have the chance to be entered into the lottery. For instance, if you win the lottery draw, and your final score at the 'Jackpot Trial' amoun ts to 350 points, then you will receive a cash prize of \u00a335. Nevertheless, a final score below 200 (e.g. 150 points) at the 'Jackpot Trial' would mean that your cash prize would be ZERO even if you win the lottery draw, since you fall short of the threshol d. 2) The maximum Bonus Points you can get in each trial is 350, meaning that you can potentially win a cash prize of \u00a335. You will start with 150 points. Appendices 367 3) In this game you will be then asked to roll a fair die once in every round (there will be multipl e rounds), you will be asked to enter the number you rolled on the dice. The system will then generate a change in your score (the number of extra points you'll receive) based on the number you rolled on the dice. Dependent on your die -rolling, there are 6 possible changes that could be brought to your final points scores, namely: i. -50 (resulting in you have 100 points); ii. Zero change (resulting in 150 points: no change); iii. +50 (resulting in 200 points: you just meet the threshold to be entered int o the lottery and you could win \u00a320); iv. +100 (resulting in 250 points: you exceed the threshold to be entered into the lottery and you could win \u00a325); v. +150 (resulting in 300 points: you exceed the threshold to be entered into the lottery and you could win \u00a330); vi. +200 (resulting in 350 points: you exceed the threshold to be entered into the lottery and you could win \u00a335. A large number rolled does not necessarily guarantee a more favourable change, and vice versa. Instead, the level of your final bo nus is the outcome of the system's RANDOM assignment. The system would assign at random 1 of the 6 abovementioned outcomes to 1 of the 6 numbers on the die. That is, there is an equal opportunity for you to achieve either of the six abovementioned possible changes. Structure of the Game In this game each player will play alongside a different partner at each round. You and your partners will not be identifiable to one another, and will remain anonymous throughout the whole experiment. Throughout this experi ment you and your partners will take turns to make decisions that might affect each other's possible final payoffs at each round. Interactions with your Partner In this game we allow interactions among the anonymous partners in each round following your in itial die -rolling. Depending on your (or your partner's) final score at each trial, you could be in a position to either help your partner (by giving some of your points) or to receive help (i.e. bonus points) from your partner. Appendices 368 Helper In case your post die-rolling score amounts to 250 or more, you can decide whether or not to help by transferring some of your bonus points to your partner in case he/she fails to hit the threshold. That way your partner could be eligible to earn a cash prize. There are cer tain basic guidelines, though, if you agree to help: A. You could decide whether to request a repayment from your partner; B. Your own Post -transfer must not fall below the 200 -point threshold. For instance, if your post die -rolling point is 350, you cannot give more than 150 to your partner; C. Your partner's Post -transfer score must be at least 200 to render your transfer meaningful Recipient You could potentially receive help (in the form of a point transfer) from your partner, in case your Post die -rolling score fall short of the 200 -point threshold in any trials That way you are still eligible to win a cash prize in case you win the lottery draw, and this trial is selected as your 'Jackpot Trial'. Your partner could decide whether to transfer some of his/her ext ra points to you to help you reach the bonus threshold. Your partner may decide to impose a repayment condition on his/her transfer. You reserve the rights to agree to or to decline your partner's offer at each round . Please be reminded that any rejection of partner's transfer will yield you ZERO payoff, if you win the lottery draw and that trial being your 'Jackpot Trial'. Owing to this interactive nature of the present experiment, you would therefore see several waiting screens (at every round) as your pa rtner is making his/her decisions. Certain waiting screens can at most last for 5 -6 minutes, depending on how many decisions your partners have to make. Likewise, your partners will be shown the same waiting screens when you are asked to make your decisions . Please once again be reminded that you and your different partners will not be identifiable to one another throughout the entire experiment Appendices 369 Appendix 7.

You can decide whether to request a repayment from your partner following your transfer ; 2. Your own 'Post -Transfer' points must not fall below the threshold, i.e. 200 points, meaning that you cannot give more than 150 points ; 3.

Trial 1: Helping Rules (Information Screen B) 'Knowing your partner's failure to make the threshold, Please indicate whether or not you want to help your partner, by transferring part of your points t o him/her, so that he/she could claim some bonus in case he/she wins the lottery. You can decide later whether or not to impose any repayment requests on your transfer. Please be reminded that neither you nor your partner will be able to spot one another. ' VIII.
