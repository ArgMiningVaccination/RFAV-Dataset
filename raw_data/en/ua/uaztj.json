This gap was exacerbated by the rapidly changing and excessive volume of information, misinformation, and disinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. People with lower health literacy may not have understood the importance of COVID-19 vaccination for themselves or for their communities. Our aim was to understand health literacy levels within Fulton County, Georgia, and their relationship to vaccine prevalence. Fulton county residents ages 18 and over (n = 425) completed an on-line Health Literacy Questionnaire. Individual, organizational, functional, interactive, and critical health literacy scales were created. Vaccination prevalence data were collected from the Georgia Vaccine Distribution Dashboard. All data were divided into one of three county areas. There were statistically significant variations in vaccine prevalence 2(3) = 29.325, p < 0.001 among the three county areas. All levels of health literacy predicted overall county vaccination prevalence F (4,420) = 85.941, p < 0.001, There were significant differences in health literacy levels among two of the three county area pairs; the lowest resourced county area had the lowest vaccination prevalence and health literacy rates. This is the first example of relating direct health literacy measures across a major metropolitan US county with vaccine prevalence data.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-11-23", "cleaned_text": "The Relationship between Health Literacy and COVID-19 Vaccination Prevalence during a Rapidly Evolving Pandemic and Infodemic [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10121989](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10121989) [Vaccines in the Age of the Infodemic: Vaccine Knowledge and How to Improve Health Literacy]( /journal/vaccines/special_issues/vaccines_in_the_age_of_the_infodemic_vaccine_knowledge_and_how_to_improve_health_literacy )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-10-01989), [2](#B2-vaccines-10-01989)]. Individual core principles such as choice, freedom, and religious belief have contributed to vaccine refusal, but for many, the plethora of information and misinformation repeatedly delivered through multiple information channels created hesitancy to receive the COVID-19 vaccine [ [3](#B3-vaccines-10-01989)]. Multiple contradictory narratives increased the reluctance of those who already had concerns about the potential side effects of the vaccination [ [4](#B4-vaccines-10-01989)]. Narratives that were widely distributed included vaccine-induced infertility, disruption of the immune system, alteration of DNA, and autism [ [5](#B5-vaccines-10-01989), [6](#B6-vaccines-10-01989)]. Vaccine hesitancy, a disinclination to receive a vaccine regardless of its availability, is a behavior that has been exhibited since the development of vaccine technology and has been correlated with misinformation [ [6](#B6-vaccines-10-01989)]. [7](#B7-vaccines-10-01989), [8](#B8-vaccines-10-01989)]. Combining different assets and skills, and variable depending on situation and context, health literacy can be measured using many different individual constructs (e.g., reading, numeracy, disease-specific, self-reported) [ [9](#B9-vaccines-10-01989)], making it problematic to capture, measure, and compare across studies and populations [ [10](#B10-vaccines-10-01989)]. However, despite differences in process and product, all these measures indicate that to have lower health literacy means not having a range of skills to understand and use health information and services, especially in a rapidly changing environment like the COVID-19 pandemic and infodemic. People around the globe with low health literacy struggled to acquire, understand, and use health information during the COVID-19 pandemic [ [2](#B2-vaccines-10-01989), [11](#B11-vaccines-10-01989), [12](#B12-vaccines-10-01989)]. [7](#B7-vaccines-10-01989), [13](#B13-vaccines-10-01989)]. The HLQ is used across countries, population settings, and economies; results have been used to guide intervention development, communication practices, and health program evaluation [ [10](#B10-vaccines-10-01989)]. In particular, findings can help healthcare organizations and providers of health information like public health agencies recognize how people experience the healthcare system, including understanding and using health information [ [14](#B14-vaccines-10-01989), [15](#B15-vaccines-10-01989)]. In this study, we used the HLQ to understand the relationship between lived health literacy experiences and COVID-19 vaccine prevalence across Fulton County, the largest county in Georgia, which is composed of three distinct geographical county areas: North Fulton, the city of Atlanta, and South Fulton. Our research questions are: - Is there a difference among county areas (North Fulton, South Fulton, Atlanta) in vaccination prevalence and in demographic factors that might predict vaccination prevalence? - How do individual and organizational health literacy scores for Fulton County residents vary by county area (North Fulton, South Fulton, Atlanta)? - Is functional, interactive, and critical health literacy associated with vaccination prevalence by county area? 2. Methods 2.1. Sample 2.2. Measures [10](#B10-vaccines-10-01989)]. The nine scales contain four to six items scored on a Likert-style scale; four scales have four response options (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree) and five scales have five response options (cannot do, very difficult, difficult, easy, very easy). Seven of the scales represent individual health literacy domains: having sufficient information to manage my health, actively managing my health, social support for health appraisal of health information, ability to actively engage with healthcare providers, ability to find good health information, and understand health information enough to know what to do. Two of the scales represent organizational health literacy domains: feeling understood and supported by a healthcare provider and navigating the healthcare system. There is no overall total score, and no standard score for each scale to indicate low health literacy [ [10](#B10-vaccines-10-01989), [16](#B16-vaccines-10-01989)]. We followed methods used by other researchers to create binary variables to measure lower and higher health literacy [ [10](#B10-vaccines-10-01989), [14](#B14-vaccines-10-01989), [15](#B15-vaccines-10-01989), [17](#B17-vaccines-10-01989)]. For scales with scores of 1-4, the cut off was 50%; for scales with scores of 1-5, the cut off was less than or equal to 60 [ [17](#B17-vaccines-10-01989)]. [Supplementary Table S1](#app1-vaccines-10-01989). [18](#B18-vaccines-10-01989)]. Data were provided for first vaccination and complete vaccination (2 shots) for people ages 6 months and older; we used the complete vaccination data. Children ages 6 months to 19 years old were 12.6% of the total pool. We cross-walked the census tracts to zip codes using the Housing and Urban Development Census Tract to Zip Code Crosswalk report [ [19](#B19-vaccines-10-01989)]. For participants, we received zip code data and geocoded them to North or South Fulton or City of Atlanta. Vaccination prevalence by county area was calculated by weighting the number of vaccines given by the population count in each zip code. 3. lowest health literacy across all domains. [Table 3](#vaccines-10-01989-t003). [Supplementary Table S2](#app1-vaccines-10-01989)for results of pairwise comparisons and [Figure 5](#vaccines-10-01989-f005)for county area estimates of vaccination prevalence and health literacy levels (functional, interactive, critical). 4. Discussion [20](#B20-vaccines-10-01989)]. Turkish researchers affirmed the relationship between vaccine hesitancy and health literacy; people with difficulty understanding COVID-19 vaccine information, i.e., those with lower health literacy, were more likely to experience vaccine hesitancy [ [21](#B21-vaccines-10-01989)]. Other researchers showed that the ability to detect fake news and health literacy scores were associated with COVID-19 vaccine intention; the risk of poor vaccine intention was higher among those having lower health literacy (OR = 1.44; 95%CI = 1.04, 2.00) [ [22](#B22-vaccines-10-01989)]. Studies in Italy show the relationship between difficulties in accessing and understanding vaccine information and lower health literacy among a cross-sectional survey of 3500 participants [ [23](#B23-vaccines-10-01989)]. Most studies assessed self-reported vaccine hesitancy; according to Hu et al., in a study assessing vaccine hesitancy and vaccination prevalence across the US, there is a large discrepancy between self-reported vaccine hesitancy and actual vaccination coverage (2022) [ [24](#B24-vaccines-10-01989)]. Due to the availability of completed administrative vaccination data from the Georgia Department of Public Health, we were able to directly measure heath literacy rates and compare them with actual vaccine compliance. [25](#B25-vaccines-10-01989), [26](#B26-vaccines-10-01989), [27](#B27-vaccines-10-01989)]. People with lower health literacy face innumerable challenges assessing and using health information in general. During the COVID-19 pandemic, an inability to engage with and act upon rapidly evolving critical health information about mitigation strategies and the need for vaccination deeply affected people with lower health literacy [ [28](#B28-vaccines-10-01989)]. From a public health perspective, greater individual health literacy skills can lead to greater personal empowerment, knowledge, and agency, which may ultimately lead to informed decisions and actions that can improve health outcomes. Strong organizational health literacy efforts can help individuals meet the complex demands of the health environment. [1](#B1-vaccines-10-01989)]. [29](#B29-vaccines-10-01989), [30](#B30-vaccines-10-01989), [31](#B31-vaccines-10-01989)], which can be measured at the organizational level (e.g., how many staff have been trained, number of electronic health record/charts that indicate Teach-Back was used) and at the patient level (e.g., electronic health record/charts that indicate patient correctly taught back medical instructions; patient following medication and discharge instructions appropriately, including follow-up appointments). Improving access to written and web-based patient education developed using plain language and health literacy guidelines is a second example of how organizations can become more health literate. One in five US adults reads at elementary levels [ [32](#B32-vaccines-10-01989)]; documents and web-based educational materials should not only be readable at the 8th grade level, but should also be written in plain language that ensures people cannot only read the words, but can understand what they read the first time [ [33](#B33-vaccines-10-01989)]. National culturally and linguistically appropriate standards (CLAS) should be implemented to ensure equitable, understandable, and respectful access to health care for people who are non-native English speakers [ [34](#B34-vaccines-10-01989)]. Federal regulations require access to interpretive services for non-native English speakers, as well as appropriate navigation signage. Written materials should not only be translated, but should also go through a continuous review process to ensure they are also culturally responsive for the intended audience. [1](#B1-vaccines-10-01989), [5](#B5-vaccines-10-01989), [18](#B18-vaccines-10-01989)]; improving health literacy may contribute to reducing disparities in health outcomes.
