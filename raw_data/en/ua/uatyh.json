Honouring the best film and television over the past year, the annual awards usually boast a star-studded guest list - but this year there will be no red carpet or celebrity presenters. According to [Variety](https://variety.com/2022/film/columns/golden-globes-no-celebrity-presenters-1235146563/), the Globes the year will \"move forward with a small event on January 9th that will not only award the best performances in television and film for 2021, but also recognise the importance of supporting diverse creative across the industry\". The statement from the awards body also addressed how the Golden Globes will focus on championing \"diverse, community-based programs that empower inclusive filmmakers and journalists to pursue their storytelling passions\". In recent years, the awards have attracted their fair share of controversy; a [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-02-21/hfpa-golden-globes-2021-who-are-the-members) report last year highlighted that none of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's (HFPA) 87 members at the time were Black and that the nomination process was \"influenced by over-the-top gifting\". Celebrities took action after the news, with Tom Cruise returning his Golden Globe awards, while Scarlett Johanssen and Mark Ruffalo encouraged other actors to \"step back\" from the association. As a result, the organisation added 21 new members which it says makes for \"its most diverse class to date\". For 2022, the awards won't be televised, with NBC explaining that the HFPA is \"committed to meaningful reform\". [A statement read:](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a38667577/golden-globes-2022-explainer/) \"Change of this magnitude takes time and work, and we feel strongly that the HFPA needs time to do it right. As such, NBC will not air the 2022 Golden Globes. Assuming the organisation executes on its plan, we are hopeful we will be in a position to air the show in January 2023.\" The event will have no red carpet or celebrity presenters, with \"limited guests\" who must adhere to \"strict Covid protocols\" including full vaccination proof and a negative PCR test. We can expect more virtual appearances and at-home celebrity style as we saw at "}
