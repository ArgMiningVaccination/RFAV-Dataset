Mrs. K. C. S., age 62 years (Patient Identification Number - 16921) visited our LifeForce centre on 8th September, 2011. She was complaining of a single non healing varicose ulcer on her left foot since last 7 years. It would itch slightly with occasional watery discharge. It was mildly painful. The skin was dry, hypo pigmented with blackish discoloration. There was swelling in left feet. She had taken many antibiotics courses in the past, but nothing seemed to help. She had stopped all the medicines since last 3 years. Her sister too was a suffering from varicose veins and ulcer. She had undergone a surgery for varicose vein 2 years back which did not relieve her as expected. She had developed this ulcer as an occupational hazard as she was a teacher and would stand for long hours to give lectures. She was a high blood pressure patient; controlled with conventional medication. She had been regularly checking her sugar levels and they would be reported normal. She had an average appetite with liking for salty and sweet things. Her thirst was average. She would not sweat easily. She could tolerate both the temperature extremes without difficulty. She had attained menopause few years back. She was well built in appearance. She was a retired teacher now. Her husband was a businessman. She had a daughter who was married and well settled; and a son who was also married and in the same family business. She was talkative and expressive by nature. She described herself as 'perfectionist and fastidious'. She had enjoyed her profession as a teacher and had no major stresses in her life. Minor issues with husband or children would not affect her. She had a past surgical history of hernioplasty and cataract operation. Her sister had diabetes, thyroid disorder and varicose ulcer. Her case was studied in detail by Dr. Shah and she was prescribed Carcinosin 30c and Mercuris Solublis 30c along with some research based medicines. After 6 months of medication on 7th February, 2012 there was no significant improvement seen. The mild itching, pain had considerably subsided. The ulcer had started to show some healing from the sides of the wound. Her case was reviewed by Dr. Shah and Lachesis 30c was added with the upgraded medicines. After 3 months of medication on 10th May, 2012 she reported with considerable improvement in the appearance of the wound. The pain had completely subsided. The swelling had reduced. She hadn't noticed these changes in the past 6 years in the appearance which she had reported us. On 8th August, 2012 she personally visited our head centre to thank Dr. Shah as her wound had completely healed. There was no sign of any wound in her leg except the post healing dark pigmentation. This case illustrates the power of healing with homeopathic medicines when administered accurately.
