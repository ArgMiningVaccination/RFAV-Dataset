Overall, patients do not consider acupuncture to be painful and find that the benefits outweigh any minor discomfort. You may feel a small pinch as the needle is placed but this dissipates quickly. Most people do not even realize a needle was inserted. Common and expected sensations once the needle is in place may include a dull ache, tingling, pulsating, or nothing at all. Pain isn't something that should be felt or elicited. Communication is open at all times to ensure sensations are therapeutically appropriate. Dr. Lauren is attentive to your needs and will adjust or remove any needles until you feel comfortable. Many patients feel so relaxed they fall asleep and have a little acu-nap. How thick are acupuncture needles? The thickness of needles used for treatment vary depending on the individual patient, specific condition, and the acupuncturist's preference. Acupuncture needles are solid with a fine point and constructed for patient comfort, unlike hypodermic needles that are hollow and significantly larger in gauge. We use needles between .16-.25mm in diameter. For reference, most acupuncture needles are so thin that you could fit 20-40 of them inside the shaft of a typical hypodermic needle. How many treatments will I need? This is dependent on many factors and varies between individuals. Acute cases may see results in as little as 1-3 treatments. Chronic conditions require more time to notice benefits although it's common to see improvements in pain reduction, sleep, and mood after your first treatment. Acupuncture activates your body's intrinsic healing response so just as your condition didn't develop overnight, healing is a process that requires commitment on your part, both in and outside the clinic. In general, a course of 10 treatments is recommended at either 1-2 treatments a week and then reassessment will determine the frequency of ongoing care or maintenance. I don't see my condition listed; will acupuncture still help me? The conditions mentioned are not meant to be a comprehensive list. Acupuncture treatment is based on Chinese Medicine diagnosis which holistically takes into account the person and their unique manifestations of illness. We determine imbalances based on traditional theory, treating you as an individual-not your disease. Chinese Medicine is especially skilled at uncovering various patterns that allopathic medicine is unable to recognize or successfully address. Therefore, Acupuncture is able to detect and treat subtle physiological imbalances before they progress into a diagnosable disease. Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture can help you by addressing the root cause of your symptoms, prevent disease in the future, and support longevity. Who can practice acupuncture? While acupuncture needles may be purchased by people other than acupuncturists, it is strongly advised that you only allow a Licensed Acupuncturist to needle you. Please note that MDs, chiropractors, and physical therapists are not Licensed Acupuncturists. They may perform \"dry needling\" but they are not practicing acupuncture. Acupuncture belongs to Chinese Medicine and is based in rich theory and east-asian diagnosis that is performed by practitioners who have extensive and thorough training. A Licensed Acupuncturist has attended a post-graduate program at an accredited school, completed thousands of hours of required training, earned at least a master's degree in the field, passed national medical boards, and holds a professional license.
