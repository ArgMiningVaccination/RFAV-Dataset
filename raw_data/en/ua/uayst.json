Babies suffering from colic arch their back, clench their fists, tighten the stomach muscles, and bend their arms and knees towards the belly while crying. Their abdominal muscles are usually tense, and they pass a lot of wind. Colic starts at about 3 weeks and goes away by the time the baby is 4 to 6 months old. The exact cause of colic is unknown, although gas or indigestion are common triggers. It may also happen due to intolerance toward substances in breast milk. Here are some natural remedies for colic in babies. 24 Effective Natural Remedies to Treat Colic in Infants Colic can cause immense pain and discomfort in your baby. These old home remedies for colic in babies guarantee relief from the problem. 1. Give a Warm Bath Giving a warm bath is a natural remedy for [colic in babies](https://parenting.firstcry.com/articles/colic-in-babies-causes-symptoms-and-treatments/?ref=interlink), that has been practised for centuries. Warm water relieves the pain. You can also gently massage your baby's abdomen while bathing her. 2. Apply a Warm Compress A warm compress provides relief from gas. Dip a towel in warm water and squeeze it. Place the cloth on your baby's tummy or gently rub her tummy with it. 3. Massage Your Baby Massages not only soothe babies but also aid digestion. Take olive oil or coconut oil on your palms, and massage your little one's tummy in a clockwise direction. 4. Try the Pedalling Exercise This is a simple but effective exercise.

This helps to relieve gas and prevents the trapping of air in the baby's belly. After you feed your baby, put her on your shoulder.

Feed a Little Longer on Each Breast Ensure that your baby feeds longer on each breast rather than alternating between each breast. The hindmilk that comes out after the baby has sucked on a breast for a while is more nutritious than the foremilk that comes out at the beginning. Hindmilk contains more fat, which promotes digestion and soothes the stomach. Too much foremilk can cause digestive distress. 8. Place Her in a Rocking Chair Rocking the baby in your arms or a rocking chair, and carrying her around in a sling so that you can rock her while standing up can calm and soothe an upset baby. 9. Make a Concoction of Tulsi Leaves Tulsi (basil) leaves have antispasmodic properties.

A particular strain of probiotics called Lactobacillus reuteri has been found to be effective in dealing with colic. It helps to reduce gut inflammation, kills bacteria and inhibits E. coli bacteria that is present more in babies with colic than in babies without colic. Also, many infants with colic get better within 3 weeks. It is better to introduce probiotics after 6 months, as it is not required until the baby is exclusively breastfed. Seek a doctor's advice in deciding the probiotic to be given to your baby. 12. Try Peppermint Peppermint has calming and antispasmodic properties. Add a drop of the oil in a teaspoon of [baby massage oil](https://parenting.firstcry.com/articles/massage-oils-which-one-is-good-for-your-baby/?ref=interlink) and rub it between your palms to warm it up.

Avoid dairy products, foods that contain gluten, citrus fruits, caffeine and spicy foods if your baby suffers from colic. 14. Cut the Chaos Don't soothe your baby by talking or singing loudly to her. Create an environment that is calm and quiet. 15. Change the Feeding Bottle Not changing the feeding bottle may be a cause of colic too. Changing the [feeding bottle](https://parenting.firstcry.com/articles/bottle-feeding-problems-and-their-solutions/?ref=interlink) alters the amount of air that your baby swallows while feeding. This, in turn, affects digestion. So make sure you change your little one's feeding bottle. 16.

Also, ask your doctor for preservative-free gripe water recommendations. 17. Change the Formula Milk Brand If your baby is colicky all the time, changing the formula milk brand may help. Sometimes, the ingredients of a particular formula milk brand may be the cause of colic. If you have started giving formula milk to your baby along with breastfeeding or otherwise, and he suffers from colicky, try changing formula milk. 18. Apple Cider Vinegar Apple cider helps reduce heartburn and fights yeast infections. Therefore, trying out apple cider might solve your baby's colic. Apple cider vinegar can be introduced once the baby turns 6 months old. Also, ensure you choose pasteurized and filtered apple cider vinegar for babies. Undiluted form of apple cider vinegar can cause a burning sensation as it has 5% acidity; therefore, diluting it is recommended. You may do so by adding 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar to 4 oz of water. You may increase the quantity of apple cider vinegar to 1 tablespoon in 4 oz of water for older babies. 19. Mint Tea Mint provides relief from intestinal cramping; however, it can be given only to babies older than 6 months. Add a teaspoon of mint into a cup of hot water and let it sit for 10 minutes. Then, strain it and feed a few teaspoons of this tea to your baby. 20. Ask for Help Colic is a health condition that does not have any specific cause or treatment. If the situation becomes unmanageable, take the help of your partner or a grandparent. 21. Initiate Tummy Time Place your baby on her tummy, across your lap. Rubbing the back also helps to pass gas. Remember to initiate tummy time only when your baby is awake but not immediately post-feeding. There should be a gap of 30 minutes minimum between feeding and tummy time. 22.

Which Food Causes Colic in Babies? According to the studies, foods eaten by the mother, including cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, chocolate, onions and cow's milk, cause colic attacks in her breastfed baby. 2. Can Breastmilk Help to Reduce Colic in Babies? Yes, breastmilk can help reduce colic, but the mother must ensure that the baby gets lots of \"hindmilk\" at each feeding and not just \"foremilk.\" You can do this by ensuring one breast is finished before offering the other to the baby.

If you feel that the situation is out of control even after trying these colic pain in infants home remedies, always seek your doctor's advice. References/Resources: 1. Colic; mayoclinic.org; Ran D.
