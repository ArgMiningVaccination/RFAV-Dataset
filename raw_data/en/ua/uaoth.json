The word ayahuasca comes from the Quechua language and can be translated as \"the vine of the soul \"or\"the vine of death \"; this brew is also known by several other names such as yage, hoasca, or caapi [8]. This name can re-fer to a single plant species, the vine Banisteriopsis caapi ex Griseb.) Morton (Malpighiaceae), rich in -carboline alkaloids [9], but it is usually associated with a mixture of B. caapi and Psychotriaviridis Ruiz & Pav. Other admixture plants, how- ever, can be also added into this mixture, but the most common names still remain the same [11 -14]. Recently, especially in the context of the ayahuasca internationalization, other non-tradi-tional plants are being used to create the so-called \"ayahuasca analogues \", including other Banisteriopsis and Psychotria species [15,16] or, in general, other plant sources containing -carboline and DMT [17 -19]; these alkaloids are considered the main pharmacological activity of ayahuasca [20, 21].

The prepara- tion is usually known to be composed of two main plants,Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis , which potent purging and emetic effects; cur-rently, these are considered its major pharmacological activ- ities. In recent decades, the psychoactive and visionary effect of ayahuasca has been highly sought after by the shamanictourism community, which led to the popularization of aya-huasca use globally and to a cultural distancing from its tradi-tional cosmological meanings, including that of purging andemesis. Further, the field of ethnobotany and ethnopharma-cology has also produced relatively limited data linking thephytochemical diversity of ayahuasca with the different de- grees of its purging and emetic versus psychoactive effects. Similarly, scientific interest has also principally addressed thepsychological and mental health effects of ayahuasca, over-looking the cultural and pharmacological importance of thepurging and emetic activity. The aim of this review is there-fore to shed light on the understudied purging and emeticeffect of ayahuasca herbal preparation. It firstly focuses on re-viewing the cultural relevance of emesis and purging in the context of Amazonian traditions. Secondly, on the basis of the main known phytochemicals described in the ayahuascaformula, a comprehensive pharmacological evaluation oftheir emetic and purging properties is presented.Beyond the Psychoactive Effects of Ayahuasca: Cultural and Pharmacological Relevance of Its Emetic and Purging PropertiesReviews 1275Politi M All rights reserved.

Indigenous people in South America have used ayahuasca for centuries, and the ceremony associated with its consumption hasbecome common among the mestizo populations in urban areas of the Amazon [22,23]. In particular, a few decades ago the ayahua- sca ritual became important in several Amazonian areas as a cure for drug addiction [24 -27]. More recently, it is gaining further at- tention as a treatment for other mental health disorders [28 -32]. This trend is boosted from local consumption in the Amazonianbasin to a global phenomenon, with a continued increase in scien-tific publications in recent years. Despite the emphasis on the psy-choactive effects of ayahuasca and its potential application inmental health disorders, the scientific community seems to pay less attention to its purgative and emetic properties, the latter only scarcely mentioned and mainly considered as side and un-desirable effects [33,34]. Within the traditional or ritual use, how-ever, such purgative and emetic effects are considered relevant as-pects for the overall efficacy of the ayahuasca treatment [35 -37]. This work, therefore, aims to review the cultural significance ofthese effects within the traditional and ceremonial use of ayahua-sca, and to review the pharmacology of the main constituents for their potential application in gastrointestinal health. The searches for bibliography were performed on Scifinder n, Pubmed, Web of Science and Google Scholar and the main searchwords and terms applied were \"ayahuasca \",\"Banisteriopsis caapi \", and viridis \". As 2021, from Scifinder n, the term 'ayahuasca 'highlights 408 references, which includes 78 reviews. The term Banisteriopsis caapi results in 182 references, and Psychotria viridis 185, although in both cases some r eferences are the same identified using the term ayahuasca. With the present review a narrative one (and not systematic), a manualsearch on the cultural and pharmacological significance of purga-tive and emetic effects of ayahuasca was undertaken using theoverall selected publications. Due to the large number of publica-tions, additional keywords to search within the results were used,including \"emesis, emetic, vomiting, purge, purging, purgative, cleansing, detoxifying \". All studies mentioning such kind of ef- fects, either from cultural as well as clinical and pharmacological aspects, were carefully revised and cited if considered relevant forthe purpose of the present review. Other studies including those describing the phytochemical profiles of the plants used to pre-pare ayahuasca and the very same ayahuasca herbal preparation,were also used to describe the overall chemical composition ofthis remedy; this was necessary address the pharmacology as-pects of ayahuasca. In fact, in this latter case, the literature searchfocused mainly on the single molecules contained in ayahuasca,their role in gastrointestinal health and how this is related to men- tal health. Additionally, the bioinformatics platform SwissTarget- Prediction (http://www.swisstargetprediction.ch/) was used topredict putative targets underlying the emetic effects induced bythe main components of ayahuasca. Specifically, the putative tar-gets were predicted based on the structure of the main phyto-chemicals present in the herbal preparations ( -carboline alka- loids), and the components-targets plot was built through Cyto-scape software, version 3.8. The Cultural Role of Purgative and Emetic Effects in the Use of Ayahuasca The close relation between ayahuasca s purgative and visionary effects Beyer reports that in the Amazon, vomiting is intrinsically part of life and is not considered as symptom or a sickness; it is part oflearned behaviors [11]. Within the mestizo 1population, in the vegetalista2tradition, a rather common name for ayahuasca is, in fact, purga , (purge) and the healer administering it, may be re- ferred to as the purguero [38]. Similarly, in the indigenous Amazo- nian Matsinenga language, ayahuasca is called kamarampi ,w h i c h means \"remedy for vomiting \"[39]. In a study conducted in Chazuta, Peru, ayahuasca has been reported to fulfil a poorly ritualized and predominantly purging role [35]. It has been ar-gued, too, that ayahuasca s primary and original function in the Amazonian pharmacopeia was in fact for gastrointestinal health[40], as purgative plants are a popular way of dealing with parasit-ic infections [11]. According to research among mestizo shamans, Luna points out that ayahuasca s efficacy is related to its ability to produce visions, as much as to its ability to induce vomiting and diarrhoea -so much so that when it does not fulfil one of these two functions, it is in fact considered to be a bad medicine [41].The known effect of mareaci\u00f3n , which refers to the dizziness, nau- sea, and vomiting the ayahuasca preparation provokes, is strictlylinked to the teaching qualities of plant teachers used by healers[41]. Furthermore, these physical purging 3symptoms often con- verge with the visionary ones: vomiting may occur when visionsbecome very intense, and purging may actually be a zone DMT N,N-dimethyltryptamine 1Mestizo refers to the population of mixed heritage and which does not identify as indigenous. 2Vegetalista refers to Peruvian mestizo individuals who carry out healing practices, with an indigenous origin, focused on the use of plants. 3With purging we refer to both the emetic and laxative effects of aya- huasca which are often accompanied by a larger body of symptoms suchas yawning, burping, sweating, and participating a more general cleans- ing process. 1276Politi M et al.

The ritualized chants, known as icaros ,w h i c ha c - company the experience of ayahuasca production and intake, maybe, in fact, precisely intended to trigger or reinforce the previouslymentioned state of mareaci\u00f3n [41]. In various South American indigenous health cosmologies, ill- ness may very well be seen to be caused by harmful spirits or bythe presence of objects or spirits trapped in the body [44]. Vomit- ing expels intruding entities from the body, ridding it from illness [45]. Moreover, this cleansing process might be necessary to es-tablish contact with spirit allies and plant spirits [39]. As the pur-gative and emetic effects of ayahuasca are used to cleanse spiritu-al intrusions, visions are a way for the drinker to travel to the spir-itual world to harmonize relations and cosmological imbalancesfor the restoration of health [44]. However, this may not takeplace solely for healing purposes. Hunters, for example, may use emetic plants to cleanse bad spirits in their body and, through the psychoactive effects, they may visit the spiritl world to nego-tiate game animals of the forest [39]. Initially, plants with emeticand laxative properties are administered regularly to facilitate theencounter with frightening underworld beings, difficult sensa-tions, and emotions, to cleanse spiritual impurities and preparethe initiates to meet with the spirit world of plants [46]. This alsoreinforces the link between the purgative and visionary effects of plants in shamanic contexts. The healing-related role of purging in contemporary ayahuasca settings in the Amazon and abroad Peruvian indigenous Amazonian shamanism and the use of aya- huasca have been generated and shaped through contact andexchange with nearby and foreign cultures across the centuries.An attempt to retrieve its authenticity or its traditional meanings may prove difficult [47], whereas delineating how its ritual prac- tice is being constructed in response to the needs and expecta-tions of its present participants may be more realistic [48,49]. As illustrated by Labate [47], in contemporary settings, aya- huasca use is increasingly being formulated as a therapeutic re-sponse to the needs of the \"modern self \",t oa c q u i r ed e e p e r understanding of oneself and participate in the development ofpersonal identity. Psychological language and narratives thus per- meate these experiences, and ayahuasca becomes instrumental to the processing of trauma [47]. Elements which were tradition-ally embedded in indigenous spirituality and ayahuasca use, be-longing, for example, to larger processes of cosmic creation andcultural and environmental regeneration are often marginalized,excluded from western understandings and experiences [49]. Within this neo-shamanic context, therefore, both in the Ama- zon and abroad, the meaning and act of vomiting and purging more generally also becomes porous to adjustment, as it is not widely practiced in the contemporary Western healing tradition[37]. Fotiou and Gearin report that in rare cases, vomiting maynot be considered a prerogative for healing, or as something topractice outside of the ceremony circle [37]. Labate argues thatvomiting may, in some instances, be seen as a by-product, a pre-requisite \"for the nobler visionary end \"[47]. Moreover, as simply stated by Beyer, vomiting is distressing to a Westerner, who usu- ally considers it humiliating [11].Nevertheless, ayahuasca is, in many cases, sought out by peo- ple who are not satisfied with the reductive approach of biomedi-cine and are in search of alternative therapies that holistically re-spond to Western individuals needs to address healing for the body, mind, and soul [50]. Fotiou and Gearin, who to our knowl-edge produced the only study on this topic, make the point that incontemporary ayahuasca contexts, purging is not merely a physi-cal act, but is dense with meaning [37]. Furthermore, it has been reported to be understood as being related to the healing process [37,47,50]. Some ayahuasca users report what they call a psychicpurging [49] to begin, even before consuming the beverage. in. Inthe reviewed literature to follow, it appears that vomiting plays anactive role in the various dimensions of the healing narratives ofhealers and patients, playing a fundamental role in the productionof ayahuasca se f f i c a c y . The experience of vomiting may certainly be reframed through a new psychological lens and a new understanding of healing [37]. For example, given the popular Western interest in ayahuascashamanism for mental healing and personal development pur-poses, difficulties encountered during the rituals are perceived aspersonal blockages rather than, for example, the product of sor-cery, as they might have been in indigenous settings [47]. Purgingis known to be a necessary process to expelemotions and states ofbeing which put a strain on the person, feelings of emptiness, or the weight of past traumatic events [51]. Fotiou and Gearin cite Ismael Apud, in referring basic psychological-bodily mech- anism of contents expulsion \"[52] when visions become too much to handle [37]. As ayahuasca results in confrontation with one s emotions and fears, vomiting, along with other somatisizations,are ways of purging such feelings and producing relief [3]. Gearinsustains that \"psychic-bodily residues \"of types of social victimiza- tion appear to be the most common content that users described purging \"[51], a way to relive and expel past painful experiences and in so doing, heal trauma. Emesis, along with other bodily sen-sations, are therefore significantly intertwined to healing and thevisionary experience [37]. Vomiting and purging might be perceived as a required step to find one s life path [37], process difficult emotions, contact the unconscious, or \"expiating immoral behaviour \"[47]. Yet Fotiou and Gearin also report how a North American shaman frames the perception of negative thoughts and feelings arising as bad spirits leaving the body [37]. Purging provides a visible sign of a healing,and the notion of cleansing extends to physical and emotional butalso spiritual levels [50]. As documented by Berlowitz, emeticplant rituals are seen to release negative physical, emotional, andspiritual layers [53]. Shamanic practices may very well convergewith Western ideas of spirituality [37] and influence one another[47]. Furthermore, people may acquire new perspective or aware- ness on the relation between the physical and spiritual world [37] and vomiting, for example, may become an avenue to releasespiritual entities from the body in contemporary ayahuasca con-texts [51]. Vomiting definitely appears to also hold a social valence within the context of healing. Through synesthetic avenues, the act andsound of vomiting may diffuse across the social field of the ritualcircle and influence other participants visions and experience [51]. Moreover, ayahuasca s emetic properties are confined not 1277Politi M et Beyond All rights reserved. This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Patients, for example, referredto purging for psychic sicknesses of other people; for example,Indian women who have been sexually abused or the experienceof indigenous people [37]. They mentioned purging and rel easing what are considered to be toxic modern lifestyles such as pharma-ceutical drugs, electro-magnetic radiation, the media, processedfoods etc. [51]. Therefore, the act of purging may inform or gen- erate different outlooks on social life and the healing intentions of people expand beyond their individual concerns towards broadersocial issues and surface in visions that are mediated by the bodilyact of vomiting [37]. As highlighted by Fotiou and Gearin, despite many elements and complexities of indigenous Amazonian shamanism clearlyhave not been integrated in neo-shamanic contexts, purgingmay still carry the function of liberating the body from unhealthy emotional baggage; in addition, vomiting appears to be rather crucial in contextualizing ayahuasca efficacy, not only from a per-sonal and individualistic healing standpoint, but expanding to in-clude social and spiritual dimensions [37]. viridis are all well-known alkaloid compounds in ayahuasca, and most of theanalytical methods focus on their qualitative and quantitative de-termination [54 -56]; dedicated methodologies for these differ- ent classes of alkaloids are sometimes separately implemented[57,58], as well as their detection in human bio-fluids [59, 60]. Quantitative variations of such alkaloids in the plant material, depending on the geographical origin or the harvesting time, have been investigated [61]. In particular, the comparison of 33 samples of B. caapi and 37 samples of P. viridis collected in the same day in 22 different location in Brazil indicated the range ofharmine between 0.31 -8.43 mg/g of dried circadian fluctuations of DMT in a single living plant of P. viridis was measured over 21 h at 3 h intervals, allowing the detection of a range between 5.4 - 9.6 mg/g of dried leaves [61]. More recently, other authors pro- vided an extended investigation of a large number of wild B. caapi samples and reported the alkaloids content in the methanol ex- tract in the range of < 0.001 -18.27 harmine, respectively. This highlights the high quantitative vari-ability (respective mean values are 2.18, 0.45 and 4.79 mg/g);such quantitative variability could be related, at least partially, to the geographical origin and to differences between wild and culti- vated plants, whereas other factors like collecting season, stemdiameter, or place of collection are not critical [62]. The phyto-chemical profile of the traditionally prepared ayahuasca reflectsthe plant composition and confirms the presence of 1.16, 0.19and 1.28 mg/mL of tetrahydroharmine, harmaline, and harmineexpressed as mean values (concentration ranging from < 0.09 - 3.05 mg/g, < 0.01 -0.95 mg/g and < 0.11 -7.11 mg/g, respective- ly), thus confirming the presence of DMT as the result of the inclu-sion of P. viridis as an ingredient (mean concentration 1.08 mg/mL in a set of 33 ayahuasca samples) [62]. The above-mentioned quantitative data therefore agreewith other investigations that are more focused on the phytochemicalanalysis of the finished product -the ayahuasca herbal prepara- tion. For example, the various alkaloids profiles of 29 samples of ayahuasca herbal preparation resulted in different cultural con-texts including the religious groups Uniao do Vegetal, Santo Daime, and Barquinha, originating in Brazil during the twentieth century [63], as well as the indigenous group of Shuar from Ecua-dor has been described by Callaway [64]; within the whole sam-ples analyzed, the concentration of harmine ranged from 0.45 number of samples from each group were not the same, andtherefore it is impossible to apply a proper statistical comparison, it would appear that the Uniao do Vegetal samples are more di- luted compared with the others. This data is also observed in an-other study [54] focused on 38 ayahuasca samples obtained fromthe group Uniao do Vegetal, measuring however, that the highest DMTconcentration (14.15 mg/mL) was detected in one of the three Santo Daime samples, followed by the only Barquinha sample analyzed (12.67 mg/mL), then in one of the twenty Uniao doVegetal samples (5.84 mg/mL), and lastly in one of the five Shuarsamples (4.12 mg/mL); on the contrary, the highest whole -car- boline alkaloids concentrations were detected in four of the fiveShuar samples. This could reflect the central role of B. caapi and its-carboline alkaloids in the indigenous context compared with the more recent ayahuasca preparations which appear to be richer in the visionary and hallucinogenic DMT. With the emetic and purgative effects mainly due to the presence of B. caapi [14], such quantitative phytochemical data could therefore reflect therelevance of this kind of pharmacological activity in traditionalcontexts compared to modern ones. Although few other analyseson real ayahuasca samples are seen in the literature [65 -67], they do not contribute additional information in this regards, and fur-ther investigations are therefore necessary to better link the phy- tochemical profiles of consumed ayahuasca with clinical data. Laboratory arrangement of the ayahuasca herbal preparation [68] and full secondary metabolite analysis of B. caapi and P. viridis showed a broader picture of the alkaloids beyond the four majorones discussed above, as well as different classes of comp ounds. Beyond DMT, P. viridis also shows N-methyltryptamine and 2methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro- banistenoside A and B, procy-anidin B2, epicatechin, and other common secondary metabolitesas reported by Wang et al. [58]. A relevant variable to be consid-ered in the phytochemical description of the ingredients and theayahuasca preparation is the origin of the sample. When pow-dered plant materials or the herbal preparation are acquired from a physical or the web market, the identification of original ingre- 1278Politi M et al.

This likely applies, for example, in the casedescribed by Sim\u00e3o et al. [71] in which a commercial sample ofP. viridis contains more -carboline alkaloids than DMT. The full LCMS analysis of this work describes also different classes of phe- nolic compounds, but due to the possible sophistication, the usefulness of this phytochemical fingerprint remains unclear. A similar approach for the determination of the phenolic profiles ofB. caapi and P. viridis is described by Gonc alves et al. [72]; both bo- tanical materials, however, have been acquired from the same on-line shop as for the case of Sim\u00e3o et al. [71] Further investigationsto determine the full secondary metabolite fingerprints containedespecially in the real sample of ayahuasca herbal preparation ap-pear to be therefore still necessary. Analytical measurements of the major alkaloids were also performed in other plant species used in ayahuasca analogues [62]; this topic, however, remainoutside of the scope of the present article. The change in the concentration of the major alkaloids in the ayahuasca preparation in relation to the decoction time appliedduring the preparation was measured [73]. Harmine, harmaline,tetrahydroharmine, harmalol, and DMT concentrations in thesamples ranged from 0.3 to 36.7 mg/mL; this confirms that the cooking time is a preparation step that affects the overall alkaloid concentration. This kind of phytochemical consideration, togeth-er with those above-mentioned. are more related to the quality ofthe plant materials, indicate the necessity of deep knowledge ofB. caapi and P. viridis as well as the very same mode of dressing of the ayahuasca herbal preparation to obtain a high-quality herbalproduct. This knowledge is certainly part of the heritage of indig-enous peoples who for many centuries have been able to distin- guish dozens of different \"types \"of liana ( B. or leaves from chacruna ( P. viridis ) within one of the most biodiverse environments in the world. This may be related to thedevelopment and plant phenological stage that are also also dis-criminant for different uses; the origin of this kind of traditionalknowledge, however, seems to still be mostly unknown. In fact,by listening to the same voice of the local healers, the plants be-come the teachers of such knowledge, and the way to prepare a good quality herbal medicine is indicated directly by the vegeta- ble entities. The concept of plants as teachers is present in theethnopharmacology literature, thanks to the anthropologist LuisE. Luna [38,74]. In this work, a particular traditional Amazonianmedicinal practice called la dieta (the diet), is clearly indicated as the main tool for acquiring a comprehensive know-how on plantmedicine, including the correct herbal mode of preparation.Although la dieta is a fundamental Amazonian traditional tool for alarming diseases and for shamanic apprenticeship, it has taken some decades for other researchers to further mention and de-scribe it scientifically [46,75,76]. Additional studies on la dieta have increased in recent years [77 -80]. Thiss seems to be the cor- rect way to try to interpret the claims of indigenous people in theAmazon regarding the acquisition of their herbal medicinal knowl-edge directly from plants. Despite the recent advances in plantbiology that recognize a degree of intelligence in the plant king- dom [81 -83], and a consequent argument about the possibilityof human-plant interactions in accord with the above-mentioned Amazonian indigenous knowledge [84], the fact that is possible tolearn directly from plants could remain difficult to be fully scien-tifically validated. Certainly, it is already clear that the chemistryof a finished herbal product can be strongly influenced by follow-ing certain traditional pharmaceutical practices; this has been ob-served for Chinese herbal medicine processing methods ( Paozhi ) such as burning, calcining, stewing, and soaking [85, 86], as well as in the case of Amazonian herbal medicine preparations which are often characterized by long decoction time [87]. A lot remainsto be done, however, concerning the scientific validation of othertraditional practices that fall outside current scientific under-standing, including blowing tobacco smoke or chanting sacredmelodies ( icaros ) on the plant remedy to influence its properties, although those are common practices within the Amazonianpharmaceutical tradition [88]; these could represent therefore important research topics for the new generation of experts in phytochemistry and pharmacognosy. The Pharmacology of Ayahuasca Preparations Emesis and purging: problem or solution? Within the modern biomedical approach, purging and emesis are usually considered more physiopathological conditions that re- quire specific treatments [89, 90] rather than therapeutic tools[91]. In different traditional medicinal contexts they are actuallyrepresenting important detoxification strategies, often practicedin combination with the use of medicinal plants; this is the case,for example, of the famous pancha karma therapy belonging to the Ayurveda tradition in India [92] or of a Buddhist drug rehabil-itation program in Thailand [93], but also of laxative herbal treat- ments belonging to the traditional Chinese medicine [94] or Japa- nese kampo [95]. Several examples of purging practices associ-ated with traditional Amazonian herbal medicine have been previ-ously described [35, 46], although animal drugs are also used forsimilar purposes [96]. In this context it is worth mentioning that aliquid preparation of tobacco is still used as an important herbalpurge [97], and similarly, in this case the tobacco enema, was alsopart of the western medical tradition [98]. It seems therefore that emesis and purging are still sitting on a subtle border between being considered problem or solution. In this regard, it is note-worthy to mention how emesis is a key protective reflex, involvingmultiple systems, including respiratory, gastrointestinal, and ab-dominal muscles, serving also as a potential therapeutic option,especially towards food toxin ingestion and migraine attack [91].It is also frequently used by bulimics as a questionable \"self-made remedy \"to control body weight gain [91]. In this regard, it is also sensitive to highlight the neurotransmitter and peptide pathways common to both emesis and appetite control. Specifically, seroto-nin, deeply involved in suppressing food intake in the hypothala-mus mediates emesis gut-deriving peptides involved short-term control of energy balance [99] are alsoable to signal emetic stimulus in the CTZ. The rationale for suchinteractions is the lack of a complete blood brain barrier in both hypothalamus, particularly in the arcuate nucleus, and CTZ, thus 1279Politi M et All rights reserved.

Significant adverse effects after consumption of classic psy- chedelics, mainly when used as pure drugs in controlled clinicalstudies, are rare; however, when consumed in unsupervised set-tings, the judgement of individuals can be compromised, oftenresulting in what are called \"bad trips \", characterized by symp- toms like anxiety, palpitations, and visual distortions [100]. By vir- tue of MAO inhibition, severe adverse effects can occur when aya-huasca or the -carbolines alone are used concomitantly with se- lective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors such as antidepressants, resultingin a potentially fatal condition known as 5-HT syndrome [101].Vomiting and diarrhoea are often reported as adverse effects re-sulting from ayahuasca consumption [102] but, again, this seemsto largely depend on the context of use. In fact, in another study conducted on depressive patients, the emetic effect was not con- sidered a cause of discomfort [103]. Self-induced vomiting, espe-cially in a context of pathological condition as for the case of buli-mia nervosa, can trigger several medical manifestations that af-fect nearly every organ system in the body; effects range fromsuperficial skin and dental findings to esophageal pathology, elec-trolyte abnormalities, cardiac arrhythmias, and in extreme cases,death [104]. On the other hand, the same practice of vomiting, as earlier mentioned, is an important aspect of traditional Amazo- nian medicine, where emetic plants labelled as \"medicinal stres- sors \", are used for depurative purposes not only to restore health but also to maintain it [35]. In our understanding, the key factorthat defines emesis and purging as a problem or a solution (butthis likely also applies to the use of psychedelics at large) is there-fore the context of use, often related to cultural context. Westernculture will probably benefit from further studies of those cultures like the Amazonian one, where know-how on emesis and purging is still in use as a therapeutic option. The etymology of the word\"pharmakon \"from ancient Greek means at the same time \"poi- son\"and \"drugs \"; this remarks the subtitle line between being a problem or a solution and the pharmacist s ability to convert a po- tential poison into an effective drug. Biochemical aspects of purgative and emetic effects The main pharmacological activities of ayahuasca are known [69,72,105]; some of them, especially due to the -carboline alka- loids, induce gastrointestinal It has been reported that these phytochemicals could induce intoxication, following oral adminis-tration of herbal preparations obtained from different plant spe- cies, such as of Peganum harmala , collectively known as \"ayahua- sca analogues \": the intoxication is characterized by different clini- cal symptoms such as visual and auditory hallucinations, locomo-tors, ataxia, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and agitation [109]. Thepharmacological mechanisms underlying these effects could beascribed to the multidirectional stimulation of serotonin pathway.Besides being well-known MAO-inhibitors, these phytochemicalsare also predicted to interact with a huge number of proteins, including serotonin receptor subtypes 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, Fig. 2 ). Among them, the sole 5-HT2A was reported to be expressed at both peripheral and central levels, and it has been described a key role of this receptor in regulating appetite control in the hypothalamus. The 5-HT2C receptor was also implicated infood intake control. Overall, the role of the 5-HT2C and 5-HT2Areceptors in food intake could depend on their interactions withhypothalamic first-order neuron-deriving peptides in the arcuatenucleus [110], which by gut-deriving 1). However, multiple studies suggest emetic effects related to the activation 5-HT2A receptor [111,112]. The emesis induced by mycotoxins has also been recently associated with theincreased plasma levels of both peptide YY and 5-HT [ 113]. It is important to highlight that 5-HT, besides acting as a neurotrans-mitter in the brain, functions as a mitogen and pro-inflammatoryfactor, particularly in the gut, which synthesizes most of 5-HT pool[114]. Conversely pro-inflammatory stimuli were reported to in-crease gut 5-HT levels [115,116]. Ayahuasca is the serotonergic 5-HT2A agonist DMT [117], whereas docking the aforemen-tioned -carboline alkaloids and DMT with the 5-HT2A receptors ( Fig. 3 ), thus further supporting the involvement of these com- pounds in the emetic and purgative effects induced by traditionalpreparations of ayahuasca [118]. Specifically, the levels of thesealkaloids in ayahuasca water (27 -2000 \u00b5g/mL) [108] agree with the putative micromolar affinities of the same com- pounds towards 5HT2A receptors. Therefore, further pharmaco- logical studies need to advance our understanding of the role ofserotoninergic system in the emetic and purgative effects inducedby ayahuasca. Nevertheless, the very similar affinities displayed bythese compounds towards the 5-HT2A rece ptors permit a hypoth- esis of their the emetic and purgative effects in-duced by ayahuasca preparations, thus partly explaining the sim-ilar effects of different preparations of ayahuasca not always traceable, to some plant mixtures used in the preparations of tra- Fig. 1 Structures of rights reserved.Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only.

However, we cannot exclude that these alka- loids could target other serotonin receptors, including 5-HT4, and above all, involved in the induction of emesis [119]. The Role of Gut Microbiota in Relation to Mental Health The gut microbiota also seems to have an influence in the devel- opment of various diseases of the central nervous system, includ-ing motility and behavioral disorders, neurodegenerative dis-eases, cerebrovascular accidents, and neuroimmune-mediateddisorders [120]. Scientific studies have highlighted a direct corre-lation between the intestinal microbiota and the brain, establish- ing the existence of the so-called gut microbiota -brain axis, iden- tifying different pathways of communication along this axis in-cluding those driven by the immune system, the vagus nerve, orby modulation of neuroactive compounds by the microbiota[121]. Gut bacteria have been dis covered to possess the ability to produce and manipulate several neurotransmitters including se-rotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, GABA, and more. Although thedirect pharmacological effects of psychedelics on bacteria are understudied, the emotional and psychological benefits of psy-chedelics may indirectly alter microbial communities in the gas- trointestinal tract via induced changes in vagal nerve tone, stressresponse, and enteric environment [122]. caapi including harmine and harma- line has been measured [123,124] and this could contribute toalter the overall gut microbiota in using ayahuasca, although therelation of this effect on mental health seems difficult to assess. Recently, however, it has been suggested that low doses of psy- chedelics (micro-doses), which are sub-perceptual and thereforedo not induce a psychedelic experience, may induce their psycho-logical effects via alterations in the microbiome and related path-ways to the brain [125]. Although the direct impact of ayahuascaon the gut microbiome remains unknown, it may play a role in theoverall effects of this important traditional Amazonian medicine. Conclusion Recently, Fotiou and Gearing sought to create a dialogue betweenemic perspectives and studies that demonstrated how gut andbrain share bi-directional flows of information, including stressand emotion [37]. This suggests how the biological relation be-tween the gut and the brain echoes with the understandings oftraditional practitioners and cross- cultural narratives of purging related to the expulsion of \"negative things-including emotions- Fig. 2 Pharmacological profile of harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine.

Moreover, it ap- pears that from both indigenous and mestizo Amazonian contexts of study, the function of ayahuasca-related purgative and emeticeffects are closely linked, if not inseparable, from the visionaryand psychoactive ones; this seems fundamental even in the mod-ern context of ayahuasca use.This is even though vomiting as ahealing method is not relevant in the current Western healing cul-ture, in contemporary neo-shamanic content of ayahuasca use,purging emerges as an essential and intrinsic aspect of its medic- inal value. The scientific stance has historically marginalized emic under- standings of efficacy related to the plant world, confining them tothe realm of belief, as part of a larger mechanization tendency ofscience and of a \"colonial appropriation and marginalisation of in- digenous knowledge \"[126]. Validating ethnomedicines through a purely biochemical lens is often demeaning towards indigenousknowledge [127] and may lead to misunderstanding the basis of a plant s efficacy [88,128]. In this regard, interpreting the efficacy Fig. 3 Putative interactions between harmine ( serotonin 5-HT2A receptor.

The traditional use of ayahuasca,in fact, implies a complex ceremony full of ritualism and, althoughstill biochemically difficult to explain, it is already known thatrituals may have an impact on a treatment efficacy [129,130]; aswell, the placebo/nocebo effect is a well-known phenomenon inpharmacology, even though no drugs are involved [131]. Some of the authors (MP, LM, and CF) have recently contributed to re- search l focused on the impact of rituals and setting in psychedelictherapy 4. One of the contributions, based on a large scale survey, confirms the relevance of the traditional context concerning theuse of ayahuasca, stating that \"aspects of setting (ceremonial practices and additional supports) and set (individual motiva-tions) appear to have significant effects on users acute experi- ences, the likelihood of experiencing difficulties with integration, and longer-term well-being and mental health outcomes \"[132]. This indicates that non-pharmacological factors contribute tooverall ayahuasca efficacy, and the very same act of vomiting andpurging during an ayahuasca ceremony could also have a role inthis regard, without any need for a comprehensive biochemicalexplanation. Within the current trend of psychedelics renaissanceand psychedelics-assisted therapy programs [133,134], a wide-ranging understanding of ethnomedicines should be therefore carefully taken into account and properly integrated; this is cer- tainly true for ayahuasca, but probably applies to other psycho-active plant medicines. In this context, the scientific validation of ayahuasca as an ex- ample of traditional medicine still used within the context of ratio-nal phytotherapy results in high complexity due to multiple fac-tors that must be considered. The term refers to more than oneplant species, often used in a mixture with different proportions, as well as the beverage obtained with a modern or traditional (and often unsettled) process. The obtained preparations, also charac-terized by the qualitative presence of phytochemicals, are used intraditional ceremony with holistic health-promoting effects aswell as a modern hedonistic drug targeted for the recreational ef-fects, as reflected by the un-harmonized scientific literature. Although a full justification of the potential benefits of aya- huasca at the gastrointestinal level wasn t reached in this in- stance, both perspectives here presented, ethnocultural and pharmacological, clearly indicate a strong possibility in this re-gard; thus, suggesting further studies on this topic.
