The conflict in eastern Ukraine and worsening relations with Moscow is fueling a behind- the-scenes struggle within the Western military alliance over a proposal to bring in Montene - gro, which lies 2,000 kilometers southwest and four borders from Russia but has become a proxy in this stando.Months before a preliminary decision is due in December on its membership application, Montenegro has become the test case of NATO's willingness to keep an \"open door.\" The divi - sions over future enlargement reflect \u2014 roughly but not exactly \u2014 dierences over how the West ought to respond to a militarily aggressive Russia.

Call them the \"Dynamic Duo\" of European high-tech legal cir - cles: Villarejo, a deputy director general respon - sible for antitrust, and Nicho - las Banasevic, the head of unit responsible for competition in high tech industries and online. They led the probe that directly resulted in the charges against Google and its omnipresent search engine. The two prosecutors, while dramatically dierent in style and manner, played leading roles in landmark cases against two other behemoths of US innova - tion: Intel and Microsoft. Both cases set new records for nes imposed on individual compa - nies, totalling an eye-watering \u20ac3 billion. That bodes ill for Google, which is intent on dismissing charges that it leveraged a domi - nant position over online search to bolster its own shopping search business. \"Both Cecilio Madero Vil - larejo and Nicholas Banasevic are smart and experienced of - cials,\" says Damien Geradin, a partner at EDGE Legal. \"They have already run several major Commission investigations in the tech sectors and know how to handle the pressure that goes with such high-stake cases.\" \"Having the investigation managed by experienced ocials is particularly important given the fact Commissioner Vestager is relatively new in her job.\" It was the Commission an -titrust investigation into Mi - crosoft's Windows 2000 that rst brought together Madero, a Spanish lawyer who headed the unit responsible for the probe, and Banasevic, a British econo - mist who joined the case-team. They faced down armies of lawyers and lobbyists recruited by Microsoft that sought to dis - credit the Commission. Yet such tactics, employed subsequently by Intel too, only served to hard - en the ocials' resolve.

Wall Street says don't risk it By BEN WHITE GREECE: PAGE 28NEW YORK \u2014 Top executives on Wall Street and senior policy makers in Washington are warn - ing their European counterparts not to let Greece default and leave the eurozone, fearing the market reaction at a time of slug - gish growth in the U.S. and in - stability in the global economy. Some say they are not as freaked out as they were in 2012 about the prospect of always-in- crisis Greece getting kicked out of the eurozone, as could happen if a deal isn't reached quickly. Some would even like to let the Greeks go and move on with life. But then people mention Lehman Brothers. And the Rus -sian default. And even an assas - sination in Sarajevo in 1914. And theoretical discussion of how better prepared the world is for a Greek exit quickly turns into fe - vered rumination on how it still might spark global nancial Ar - mageddon. The bottom line: Wall Street and Washington want to keep Greece in the eurozone because no one really knows what might happen otherwise. And with the U.S. economy wobbling again, China slowing and the Middle East a short step from full-blown crisis, adding a Greek wild card to the deck is too scary a thought. \"We are certainly better o GREECE DEADLINE Greece and its creditors seem unlikely to strike a deal during Friday's Eurogroup meeting in Riga because Athens still has enough resources to play for time.

At the time, Dutch law did not yet allow him to do so. \"I got the message that it wasn't legally possible for me to have Dutch nationality. But with the Brexit coming up, I thought, well, why don't I check again. And it turns out that the law had changed.\" So six months ago, Quinn became a dual citizen of the UK and Netherlands.

And, let's face it, the rest of the year. The M\u00e9rode tunnel will be closed for \"two months,\" jamming up traffic all the way to Montgomery and Meiser. The demolition of the bridge by the Diamant/E40 motorway will start on July 1. At the same time, there will be construction on the Chauss\u00e9e de Louvain. Adding to the congestion, the center of Brussels will become car free this summer as the city attempts to create one of the largest pedestrian zones in Europe. And don't even think about an easy, breezy trip to Zaventem. With only two lanes open around the Belliard airport exit (seriously is there a map? - that is crazy), you could miss your flight. That direct airport train link from Schuman can't come quickly enough. THE EX-FILES: News in from the office of former European commissioner Antonio Tajani : Europe will be \"close to workers and citizens\" as a result of the Spanish city of Gij\u00f3n naming a street after him on Friday. \"It is also a huge privilege and a rather rare occasion to receive such a recognition while alive,\" said a modest Tajani, who is now a vice-president of the European Parliament. There's no word on how many citizens attended the 16-minute ceremony. Unfor - tunately Google Maps has not caught up with the re-naming of the 150-meter stretch of Avenida Miguel Hernandez, which was agreed last October. WORDY MATTERS: The Israeli lobby has been firing off letters to MEPs demanding that they not use the word \"Holocaust\" to define the death of any group other than Jews at the hands of the Nazis. Their missives were heard and an amendment was made to rename the \"European Roma Holocaust Memorial Day.\" Now it will be known as the \"European Memorial Day of the Roma Genocide during World War II.\" SPEECHWRITING ... IT'S A BOY THING: Do you remember \"Science: It's A Girl Thing\" \u2014 the disastrous 2013 video the Eu - ropean Commission created to encourage girls to study science?

Now I've been reported for allegations of treating,'\" \u2014 UKIP candidate Kim Rose to the BBC. \"I'm sure people aren't going to change their mind for a sausage roll.\" Meanwhile former New York mayor and media magnate Michael Bloomberg was pushed into the election fray to defend David Cameron against allegations he is too posh to eat hot dogs, tweeting fond memories of a 2010 hot dog bro-mo on the streets of NYC.

ASSAULT COURSE LAUNCHED AT SCHUMAN METRO: The only thing in Brussels taking longer than the Google antitrust investigation is the renovation of the Schuman train interchange. After seven years of ear clanging \u2014 the Belgian trans - port authorities SNCB and STIB have diversified into offering a full-scale assault course. We're thinking about offering a Guardian Angel service to users of the station who often seem in fear of their time, and their lives, when they enter the jungle of cords and clangs and concrete. At least no concrete has fallen from the roof of the Schuman station, as Playbook witnessed last week at Arts-Loi. GUESS WHO? Which director- general has been caught on mul - tiple occasions cutting the coffee queue in her building? She's also known for refusing flexi-time requests by her staff. Flexibility is good for some but not for others... Which commissioner got so drunk at a summit at Fontainbleau that he locked himself out of the Palace? Instead of knocking politely he got down on his hands and knees barked like a dog until the door was opened... Which Brussels museum director is becoming an un - popular dinner invite?

Kristalina Georgieva has now upgraded the storyline, telling Playbook: \"I had a very interesting experience with my grand-daughter. I said to her that when I was her age there was no TV and no computers. Then she turns to me and says 'so you only had iPads?'\"DOWNWARD POLS: MEPs flexed more than their vocal cords on Tuesday.

Earlier this month the Eu - ropean commissioner for com - petition initiated a potentially titanic confrontation of public versus private power by taking aim at Google \u2014 the epitome of American cool-geek technologi - cal innovation and wealth. She launched a fight of a similar scale Wednesday when she announced she is going after Gazprom \u2014 the epitome of Russian bullyboy cro - ny capitalism. Suddenly, corporate captains multiple time zones from Vestag - er's Brussels office need not only to pronounce her name \u2014 \"Vest-aah\" \u2014 they need to take a crash course on Vestagerism. Who is this goblin under Google's bed, and what are the ideas and phi - losophy of regulatory conflict that guide her? Here is a primer on the picture that has emerged so far, based on watching her first six months as Europe's competition referee and interviews with leaders in the growing legion of Brussels lobbyists and lawyers paid to reckon with her new approach. WHY IS SHE DOING THIS? People viewing Vestager from afar who view her as a radical do not have it quite right. She's made clear that she is fundamen - tally a figure who reveres process and wants to play by the rules \u2014 in public, in ways that don't in - vite conspiracy theories or sow public suspicion that the Euro - pean Union regulatory corridors are somehow not on the level. Enough of the back-door settlements favored by her pre - decessor, Spaniard Joaqu\u00edn Almunia. She wants to tell the companies what they have done wrong \u2014 and give them a chance to formally rebut those accusa - tions. This, at least, is the view promoted by her allies. Another explanation \u2014 favored by ana - lysts with a more cynical view of European Commission power \u2014 is that she has few arrows left in her quiver: the Commission has already tried and failed to settle both cases. In many elite European cir - cles, Google and Gazprom \u2014 two companies with histories and cultures that could not be more different \u2014 are united by a com - mon trait: arrogance, and a ruth - less determination to reap all the riches that can flow from their positions of market dominance. For someone like Vestager, who since her youth has been a be - liever in what people here in the so-called European project (she first took a party post in Den -mark at age 21), circumstances give her no choice but to make the point to these powerful glob - al corporations: European regu - lators won't be pushed around. WHY NOW? In a break with the traditional quiet, grey styles of European regulators, Vestager is keenly attuned to public communica - tion, and so far has proved good at it. She won high marks for a self-confident, occasionally humorous performance at her confirmation hearings. She is a hyper-kinetic presence on Twit - ter. And she is a deep believer in transparency. That belief may have influ - enced the timing of the charges against Google. She traveled to Washington last week to speak at the American Bar Association annual antitrust conference. It seems likely she wanted to arrive in the US with a decision in hand to defend and explain. She could counter any suggestions that the Google investigation was anti-American and protectionist. And if that were not enough, today she charged Gazprom, one of Russia's flagship companies, with breaking EU antitrust laws. A \"masterstroke\" of timing, says Jacques Lafitte, founder of Avisa, a consultancy. \"For the Americans, who think that the only thing that drives the EU is anti-American - ism, she can say 'I am going after Mr. Putin.' And vice-versa to the Russians.\" BUT DOES VESTAGER REALLY HARBOR ANTI-AMERICAN FEELINGS? This is highly unlikely, however much young tech titans may be hurling darts at her picture in Silicon Valley. Despite its name, her Radical Left party in Den - mark is liberal, which in the Eu - ropean sense means a believer in private enterprise that is free to reap big profits so long as it works in coordination with \u2014and ultimately is accountable to \u2014 the public interest as defined by government officials. What's more, Vestager is from the more conservative end of the party's ideological spectrum, accord - ing to Margrete Auken, a Green member of the European Parlia - ment. As a matter of cultural orien - tation, Vestager has come off so far as a thoroughly cosmopoli - tan figure \u2014 hardly the kind of person to be motivated in some kind of fundamental way by anti-Americanism or anti-capitalism. She's almost the perfect pic - ture of the modern \"lean-in\" feminist professional achiever. Under other circumstances, one could easily imagine Vestager sipping wine, trading stories of balancing career and child-rais - ing, and becoming friends with people like Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook or Marissa Mayer at Yahoo at the Aspen Ideas Festi - val. But that may have to wait for another time. The conflict with Google, as with Gazprom, may not be fundamentally about ide - ology, but it is fundamentally about power. Her probe into Google's search engine could prove ex - tremely disruptive for the US company. (It could also be futile: by the time the Commission's antitrust brawl with Microsoft finally ended, the software firm's stranglehold over personal com - puters had been broken by Apple and the Internet.) She is also running probes into the tax arrangements of US giants Apple, Amazon and Star - bucks. Only Italy's Fiat faces a similar investigation. Her competition team is also holding up General Electric's at - tempts to buy Alstom, the jewel of France's industry \u2014 a year after the French government ex - tracted better terms for its side. The US government also has concerns about the Com - mission's digital single market strategy, notably its pillar that internet platforms should be regulated. ON GAZPROM, SURELY VESTAG - ER IS WORRIED ABOUT HOW THE RUSSIANS WILL REACT? Almunia certainly was. He had drawn up charges against Gaz - prom more than a year ago, but put them on ice. He reckoned that threatening huge fines against Gazprom at a time when relations between Russia and the European Union were fraying would only make things worse. That may be true again, but Vestager \u2014 egged on by smaller member states like Lithuania \u2014 wants to go for it regardless.IS VESTAGER REALLY THAT DIFFERENT FROM ALMUNIA? On style and personality, very, very different. Officials have welcomed Ve - stager's strong and independent management style. Her cabinet is headed by two well-regarded female officials \u2014 and the trio of females stand out in the over - whelmingly male world of anti - trust law. By contrast, Almunia's team was reputedly more clubby and hierarchical. At her confirmation hearings, she declined to participate in the usual ritual courtesy of praising the work of predecessor. She seems to know, and enjoy, the fact that her gender and rela - tive youth \u2014 as much as her pow - erful regulatory battles \u2014 give her something of a celebrity sta - tus. Asked at an event Tuesday how being a woman affected her role as a Commissioner, she said it was hard to tell but that it does enable \"journalists to write lon - ger articles as they can describe my dress too.\" She has personally met many complainants, some of whom had never met Almunia. There is also a generational shift, reflected in Vestager's team but also in her savvy use of social media. That will prove useful for an antitrust commissioner whose mandate is likely to be dominated by com - petition problems involving the Internet. However, Vestager on Tuesday was keen to point out, speaking at an event, that she is no \"expert in screen design or algorithms [or] I would not be here\". That, for followers of the case, was a pointed reference to her prede - cessor, who showed journalists PowerPoint presentations of the changes he wanted Google to make to its search results page. WILL VESTAGER FIGHT THE CASES ALL THE WAY? \"She is an iron lady but also very nice and gentle,\" says Christel Schaldemose, a Danish socialist MEP. She has no doubt that Ve - stager has the mettle to see such vast and intense cases through to the end. But in her pronounce - ments so far on Google Vestager has been careful to keep her op - tions open as regards what that end would be. She would be sat - isfied with a \"principles-based\" remedy, which sounds like a settlement, but she also recog - nises the importance of setting precedent for the market, which sounds like she is ready to fight the case all the way to the Eu - ropean Court of Justice's grand chamber. To some, Vestager's move against Google last week was strong and decisive: by focusing her charges on Google Shopping, she has kept several concerns up her sleeve, which she can threat - en to throw at the firm when the going gets tough. That could her - ald a decade of litigation. To others, it was a sign of weakness: after six years of in - vestigation, the Commission could only charge Google on the basis of a complaint against its shopping service first filed in 2009. AFTER CHARGING GOOGLE AND GAZPROM CAN SHE GO ON HOLIDAY FOR 10 WEEKS After charging Google and Gazprom can she go on holiday for 10 weeks? That is how long the compa - nies normally have to reply to the charges. But the answer is no. Vestager confirmed Tuesday that she still expects to complete the tax investigations into Ama - zon, Apple, Starbucks and Fiat by the end of June. Those cases risk generating howls of anger not only from the corporations in - volved, but also from politicians who are loath to see the Com - mission tamper with national tax systems. The Commission is also prob - ing whether the contracts be - tween US movie studios and European satellite broadcast - ers breach EU antitrust rules. A finding that they do would turn the entertainment industry on its head, and turn Europe's cre - ative sectors and their national governments \u2014 particularly France \u2014 against her. Last, but not least, Vestager will have to decide whether to adhere to demands from the chief executives of Europe's largest telecom companies to relax merger control rules in exchange for promises that they will invest in infrastruc - ture \u2014 a priority for the new Commission. The problem for Vestager is that many powerful politicians across Europe back their telecom companies, as do certain of her fellow Commissioners. Without their support, Vestager is power - less \u2014 as Almunia learned at the end of his mandate. Margrethe Vestager, the European commis - sioner for competition, is making her mark.

But six months into his term, Juncker said he earned a mandate to pursue more aggressive policies because he was elected by the European Parliament \u2014 and the European Council, which typically holds the nominating power, had to follow the Par - liament's lead. \"I know the next president will be really elected by European citizens\" Juncker said. \"This was the beginning of the process, not the end of the process.\" Juncker described how he views his presidency: He relies on a strong pact with the two groups forming the majority in the European Parliament \u2014 a stronger one than any of his political ancestors ever had and that he is ready to use. The \"Group of the Five\" convenes once a month: Juncker, first vice president Frans Timmermans, European Parliament Presi - dent Martin Schulz, as well as Manfred Weber and Gianni Pittella, heads of the European People's Party and Socialists and Democrats, respectively. It's the backing of this group that enabled Juncker to take stronger positions vis-\u00e0-vis European countries' governments than former presidents of the Commission could allow themselves. \"I am not blocked by mem - ber states in this undertaking because the process of my appointment has been a totally different one.\" Eventually, Juncker said, he even \"fell in love\" with the campaign trail.

Legislation currently being drafted by Brussels mobility minister Pascal Smet, and ex - pected to be passed by January 2016, would turn Uber's 700 drivers into independent con - tractors, who would pay income taxes. However, Uber would have to be a second source of income, ac - cording to a draft report seen by POLITICO on Tuesday. While Brussels (with about 1.1 million inhabitants) is a relatively small capital city, the move is bold and reverses the city's ban on Uber last year. The California-based company has faced violent protests in Brus - sels, as well as in Paris, Madrid and Berlin. Last month, a Ger - man court banned Uber and said it would slap lawbreakers with heavy fines. And the proposed blessing by Brussels will surely face a back - lash because it comes with a big catch: a complete overhaul of the city's taxi industry. Under a draft of the law, the cap on taxi licenses would be reviewed and potentially elimi - nated, opening up the market to a flood of competition. Uber is technically illegal in Brussels but that hasn't stopped the company from gaining a large share of the market. There is one Uber driver for every two taxis in Brussels, showing how fast the app-based service has exploded in popularity. \"As compensation for the taxi sector they will remain the ones with the right to use taxi lanes, they will be the only ones who can be flagged down on the street,\" said Alexander De Croo, deputy prime minister of Belgium and a proponent of the change. However, all traditional taxis would be required to install credit card readers, which could help reduce undeclared cash fares. The average declared gross income is \u20ac25 a day, De Croo said. Uber has endured a tense re - lationship with authorities glob - ally, as they struggle to adapt to its game-changing disruption of a traditionally unionized taxi in - dustry.Detractors argue that Uber isn't on a level playing field: driv - ers can undercut the cost of taxis because they aren't forced to have public liability insurance and don't have to fork out for ex - pensive licenses. \"There was the same level of reticence with regards to Uber in many cities across the US this time two years ago. Now, dozens of states are embracing and adopting bills on both city and state level,\" said Mark Mac - Gann, Uber's head of public pol - icy for Europe, Middle East and Africa. There is now huge momentum in the states. Now we are start - ing to turn a corner in Europe.\" So far, only some parts of Europe, such as the UK, have embraced the ride-sharing app (despite protests from the black cabs in London). Governments tend to keep taxis in artificially short sup - ply by capping the number of li - censes permitted at any one time in cities, meaning that in some places the licenses cost more than apartments. Governments that try to lift caps face stiff objection, which can take the form of crippling strikes. But the political parties in Brussels that drafted the legis - lation say they now have enough votes to pass it. Els Ampe, chief whip of the Open Flemish Liberals and Dem - ocrats party and one of the key proponents, wants parliament to vote without delay to capitalize on a consensus reached on the proposal in February. \"People are getting convic - tions for something that will be totally legal in a few months,\" she said. Uber has faced hostility from licensed taxi drivers across Europe for its ride-sharing service, but Belgium is preparing legislation that would turn drivers into independent contractors. GETTY IMAGES Oettinger: Speed up tech laws now As G\u00fcnther Oettinger prepares to launch new technology initiatives, he ranted about the time it takes laws to wend their way through the European Union labyrinth and urged member states to get more involved earlier. The digital agenda commis - sioner told POLITICO it was \"not acceptable\" that laws can take as long as seven years to get from Commission proposal to national legislation, particularly when they affect the fast-moving tech sector. \"You can't work in this sector of digital services and applications in such a manner,\" Oettinger said. Oettinger said the next at - tempt at a single-market pack - age for the telecommunications industry may come before the end of the year and would take the necessary steps to develop \"a technological and legal frame - work\" for future mobile technol - ogies such as 5G. His copyright proposals, which will also form a central plank of the Commission's Digi - tal Single Market Strategy, will probably come in October. As things stand, the Com - mission conducts consultations before drawing up a communi - cation on a new proposal, which then goes through the European Parliament before finally hitting the Council, which represents member states. In these latter stages, pro - posed laws can be slashed to a bare minimum, as has happened with the first telecoms package proposed by Oettinger's prede - cessor, Neelie Kroes. The Council stripped that down to its net neutrality and roaming elements, removing everything to do with radio spectrum harmonization - an element that Oettinger and his boss, vice-president Andrus An -sip, will now have to start anew. Oettinger said he had raised these frustrations with min - isters from member states in recent weeks, and had received some positive feedback to his idea of having regular seminars with ministers, rather than re - lying on the Council's three big meetings each year. \"More and more are accept - ing, because they are seeing with our actual speed we will lose au - thority and investors,\" he said.EU digital agenda commissioner says it is \"not acceptable\" how long it takes Commission proposals to become laws By DAVID MEYER G\u00fcnther Oettinger, the European commissioner for digital economy and society, is urging the Commission to pick up speed on legislation.

Just days after after the Danish com - missioner took on US software giant Google, she tangled with even larger prey \u2014 Russian gas behemoth Gazprom. The accusation is that Gaz - prom used its market power to bully and overcharge central Eu - ropean governments and compa - nies; specifically preventing the free flow of gas across European Union states and extracting commitments in return for gas to keep control of pipelines. \"The Commission's prelimi - nary view is that Gazprom is breaking EU antitrust rules by pursuing an overall strategy to partition Central and Eastern European gas markets,\" said a Commission statement. UNDER SCRUTINY Gazprom has often served as a proxy for Russia's state inter - ests, and the Commission has kept a wary eye on its behavior in regions of the continent that formed part of Moscow's empire until the collapse of the Soviet Union. Gazprom denied it had done anything wrong, saying in a statement the accusations are \"unfounded.\" It has 12 weeks to respond to the charges. The stakes are enormous. Gazprom, with revenues of \u20ac122 billion in 2013, faces a potential maximum (albeit unlikely) fine of 10 percent of its turnover. That's even more than Google's maximum penalty, which tops out at \u20ac6 billion. And while Google is simply an influential American company, with Gazprom Vestager is taking on the Kremlin. In a sign of what those compli - cations could look like, Gazprom noted that it was a Russian, not an EU company and \"has the status of a strategic government-controlled business entity.\" That geopolitical tension was seen by some as one of the rea - sons that Vestager's predecessor, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, had held off on escalating proceedings. The gas company had hoped to deflect the Commission's wrath. Sources close to the company tell POLITICO that Alexei Miller, Gazprom's CEO (and close friend of Russian President Vladimir Pu - tin), had let the Commission know in Berlin earlier this month that his company was willing to revive settlement talks. But Vestager is determined to move. \"I am concerned that Gaz -prom is breaking EU antitrust rules by abusing its dominant position on EU gas markets,\" she said. Gazprom's divide and rule techniques \u2014 which are such a cause of concern to the Com - mission \u2014 were on full display earlier this week, when Miller dropped in to Athens to revive discussions on building a pipe - line across the Balkans. With both Gazprom and the Greeks facing the wrath of the European Commission, the two worked to undermine EU energy solidarity by reopening the issue of the so-called Turkish Stream pipeline. Athens and Moscow are still smarting over the decision to abandon the South Stream gas pipeline last year. That pipeline, which was supposed to deliver gas from across the Black Sea through Bulgaria and on to the rest of the EU, was killed by Mos - cow in December. The project had fallen victim to the souring of relations between the EU and Russia following Russia's annex - ation of Crimea. Balkan pipeline schemes are as much political as economic projects. Russia has used them to strengthen regional alliances at a time when it has few Euro - pean friends. Elmar Brok, chairman of the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, said the proposed pipeline \"is built for political reasons; to circumvent U kraine\". The European Commission has accused Gazprom of using bullying tactics to monoplise the flow of gas across Europe . GETTY IMAGES Tusk's rude awakening One year ago this week, Donald Tusk, then Poland's prime min - ister, called for an energy union to break Russia's energy strangle - hold on Europe \u2014 but the scheme now being promoted by the EU is very different from what he had originally suggested. The EU's current policy retains little of Tusk's grim warnings about being too dependent on Rus - sia, and his language extolling coal and shale gas has been slashed. Instead, the text says, \"we have to move away from an economy driven by fossil fuels and shale.\" But Tusk can claim at least one victory \u2014 energy policy is all about reducing dependency and diversi - fying, which means that Russia's importance is set to shrink. Writing in the Financial Times on April 21, 2014, Tusk made it clear he was driven to act by the growing threat from Russia, which had just annexed Crimea and was fomenting trouble in eastern Ukraine. \"One lesson is clear,\" Tusk wrote, \"ex - cessive dependence on Russian energy makes Europe weak.\" His ideas revolved largely around breaking Russia's gas monopoly, developing a mecha - nism to jointly negotiate energy contracts with Russia, better linking gas networks and bol -stering gas storage, encouraging gas deals with other European neighbors and emphasizing the \"full use\" of fossil fuels. Although Tusk's idea grabbed headlines, his ideas weren't new to Brussels insiders. \"There's nothing in the pro - posal that can be considered totally new or unknown,\" says Walter Boltz, deputy chairman of the Agency for the Coop - eration of Energy Regulators (ACER), a body aimed at com - pleting the EU's internal gas and electricity markets. POWER Tusk has in the meantime gone on to become president of the European Council, leading to a first formal commitment to the energy union by EU leaders in March. While many of his ideas did not fully survive their first encounter with his former EU peers, the Commission has used the scheme to try to seize more power from national govern - ments. \"Every bureaucratic institu - tion wants to grab ever more competencies,\" says Boltz, add - ing \"of course it's about central - ization.\" While supply security and in - frastructure still feature promi - nently in March's energy union strategy, the concept now also includes priorities such as reduc - ing energy demand and decar - bonizing the bloc's energy mix. Still, that strategy is merely a top-level paper structured in a way to avoid ruffling feath - ers. It leaves out crucial ques - tions related to governance and enforcement, especially how to implement the target of re - ducing emissions by 40 percent over 1990 levels by 2030. That is a politically thorny issue for a country like Poland, which still overwhelmingly relies on coal to generate electricity. The Commission now has to follow up with concrete propos - als, expected after the summer, something likely to open rifts be - tween EU countries. Suggestions include empowering ACER, in - troducing greater transparency in storage use, or allowing the Commission to check energy agreements with external sup - pliers before they are signed. Those steps would promote greater energy policy coordina - tion, strengthen the Commis - sion and weaken national con - trol over energy policy. However, that would revive a long-running conflict between northern and western Europe and their newer central Euro - pean counterparts. In the for - mer Soviet bloc, energy policy is largely about security from Rus - sia and access to cheap energy; the wealthier half of the conti - nent is more interested in cli - mate and environmental policies like CO2 abatement, renewables and energy efficiency. The current push for an energy union is also necessary, Boltz adds, to actually complete the internal market and for the Commission to more forcefully press the applica -tion of agreed energy rules aimed at liberalizing markets. \"Across the EU, member states haven't implemented even fundamental rules at times,\" he says. While collective commit - ments by EU leaders in March broadly reflected Tusk's original suggestions, they also showed what concepts were or weren't acceptable to national capitals as well as adding a host of other energy policy priorities. In one case, global climate talks in Paris at the end of this year drove a push to include stronger wording on the issue. The joint gas purchaser now features as a voluntary option only. West European countries including Germany and the United Kingdom had been skep - tical about its compatibility with free market principles. An industry source told PO - LITICO that the west European energy industry had solid long-term contracts with Gazprom, and so neither needed nor want - ed greater Commission involve - ment in their business dealings. By contrast, some CEE govern - ments and energy companies hoped the Commission would increase their bargaining power against the Russian company. According to ACER's Boltz, the joint gas purchasing facility is a regional option \"for countries that feel they can be blackmailed by Gazprom,\" but a mandatory Europe-wide facility \"was from the start never realistic.\" West European countries and their energy companies wouldn't need to resort to joint purchasing to deal with Russia, he explains, being less dependent on Russian gas. EU leaders however did sign up to greater transparency of gas contracts with external suppli - ers to ensure compliance with EU rules. Because of concern in countries like Germany, Hun - gary and Greece, wording was carefully adjusted, evolving from \"safeguarding\" the confidential - ity of commercially sensitive in - formation to \"guaranteeing\" it. A source close to the Commis - sion told POLITICO it is still un - clear how the Commission aims to guarantee commercial secrets if it can't even prevent frequent internal paper leaks. The agenda now before the EU differs sharply from what Tusk suggested a year ago. The next months will show if the energy union is simply a more glamor - ous brand for a slightly upgraded status quo, or if it will usher in a new energy policy era for the bloc \u2014 and weaken Russia's grip on EU energy markets, which was Tusk's goal all along. The energy union as we now know it is far from Donald Tusk's initial pitch.

The announcement late on Monday \u2014 by Edith Schippers of the Netherlands and Maggie De Block of Belgium \u2014 was made at the informal meeting of Europe - an health ministers in Riga. Until now, negotiations on prices for new medicines have taken place almost exclusively between the company and an individual country \u2014 a natural consequence of the European system where medicines may ob - tain a marketing authorization that is valid EU-wide, but pricing remains an entirely national re - sponsibility. Drug companies are frequently accused of profiting from this sys - tem by charging as much as pos - sible in each country, and smaller countries have often complained of being disadvantaged in nego - tiations. The spokesperson for De Block said Belgium had decided to ex - plore the possibilities of breaking with the usual approach last year, after it found it was having to pay a high price for the treatment for a rare kidney disease developed by Alexion \u2014 Soliris (eculizum - ab), which was priced at around \u20ac18,000 per month per patient. The cost threatened to make it difficult for the Belgian health system to balance its mission to care for individual patients but also for all patients and public health, said Els Cleemput, the minister's spokesperson. \"This made a big hole in our budget\", she said. \"Because we are a small country we have only a few patients needing expensive orphan medicines, and our nego - tiating capacity is limited.\" So Belgium started talks in December on a joint negotiating pilot with the Netherlands, which has a similarly limited number of patients with rare diseases, and reached an agreement which was signed off at Riga by both coun - tries. The focus at present is on or - phan drugs that treat rare dis - eases. Cleemput said the plan is to identify a potential product for the pilot, and \"there is no plan to extend beyond orphans - but we are not excluding anything.\" She also said that one other \u2014 small country has expressed in - terest in joining the scheme, and three pharmaceutical firms she declined to name are willing to cooperate in the pilot. Drug regulator: Take our early advice or face the consequences Drug companies should take the early advice of the European Medicines Agency \u2014 or be twice as likely to see their drugs get the regulator's red light come approv - al time, according to a new study. Experimental drugs are twice as likely to be approved if phar - maceutical firms follow the optional guidance offered by the Patient trial design also takes hit in study By ALEKSANDRA TERZIEVABelgium, Netherlands team up to take on pharma over prices \"If we work together, we represent more patients and we can more easily negotiate a lower price without sacrificing quality.\" Edith Schippers and Maggie De Block Dutch and Belgian health ministersGETTY IMAGES EMA, according to the study in Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, of 118 marketing authorizations issued between 2008 to 2012. The approval rate was around 80 percent when recommenda - tions from EMA's experts on clinical trial design were fol - lowed \u2014 compared with around 40 percent when advice was ignored. The tips may help industry, but consumer groups are wary of possible conflicts of interest between firms and the EU regu - lator in these consulting ser - vices the EMA offers prior to its review of new drugs. Companies are entitled to seek early consultation with EMA staff and experts on a medicine before seeking approval. It is a paid-for service, with the regulator giving suggestions on the tests and stud - ies that would be appropriate in the development of a medicine. The standards of companies' clinical trial designs took a hit in the study. Two-thirds were found to be inadequate on initial ex - amination. They would not have been able to demonstrate the necessary positive relationship between benefit and risk, said the EMA, which conducted the study. The authors argued that com - plying with advice also makes for quicker and easier processing of an application. Fewer objections are raised during the evaluation process, and a decision emerges on average 61 days sooner. European consumer advocates have warned that systematic in - volvement of the EMA along the drug development path could influence the final assessment of the product and open the door to possible conflicts of interest. Ilaria Passarani from the Eu - ropean Consumer Organisation BEUC said early advice can speed up access to effective new treat - ments but said there should be a clear line between those giving early advice and officials evalu - ating new drugs.\"However, it is vital to ensure that regulators' involvement does not undermine their inde - pendence,\" she said. \"To avoid any potential conflict of interest, scientific advisers should stay out of the marketing authorization procedure.\" Ancel.la Santos Quintano of Health Action International also supports improving the qual - ity and safety of new medicines, but cautioned that \"there is immense potential for conflicts of interest,\" particularly since EMA receives fees for advice and \"later decides the marketing authorization for these products, again in exchange for fees.\"Concern over steep drug costs has mounted in health ministries and paying agencies in the last year, triggered by medicines such as Sovaldi, Gil - ead's hepatitis C treatment with a price-tag of around \u20ac80,000 on launch in Europe. In response to the challenge posed to health care budgets, France and Italy spearheaded a drive last year among EU mem - ber states to form a common front and create joint purchasing arrangements. But that attempt petered out by the end of 2014, in the face of opposition from half a dozen countries \u2014 notably the UK and Germany. Schippers and De Block said they are convinced that joint efforts could lead to valuable results for health ministries and patients: \"If we work together, we represent more patients and we can more easily negotiate a lower price without sacrificing quality,\" they said. A spokesman for Schippers said that the Netherlands has always been supportive of cooper - ation in price negotiations. Neth - erlands holds the presidency of the Council of the European Union in the first half of 2016, and Schippers said the country plans to focus on European cooperation on drug prices and on bringing innovative medicines to the European market faster \u2014 and at affordable prices. Drug industry experts have responded cautiously, question - ing whether joint negotiation will make any difference as long as pricing systems and responsi - bility remain purely national. One described the initiative as \"political posturing\" geared to making it look as if govern - ments were acting against ex - cessive prices.\"This town has changed so much since you lived here.\" The returnee hears this view all the time. In every case but one (and that eurocrat requires anonymity) the speaker means for the better. Insists on it with a smile and a pat on the arm. As if \u2014 after 15 years of life outside the soggy capital of Europe \u2014 you need a psychic palliative. Turn of the last century: That's when I last lived and worked in Brus - sels. And as I settle back into this city, I realize that the old spirit and ideals have drained away, replaced by a palpable pragma - tism that is both cynical and en - ergetic. Here's what I find... * * * The first few weeks, you search for this new Brussels that every - one talks about and find your - self back in 1999. The EU office blocks placed at odd angles with no regard for the surroundings; subway cars out of the seventies; taxis that refuse to take a credit card (what's this Uber you hear about?). The graffiti seems to be in the same spots \u2014 maybe \"No to TTIP\" wasn't here in the 20th century, when a free trade agreement between Europe and America existed only in la la land. As then, half the escalators don't work and the natives are on strike half the time. The bars never close, the food's great, the rents are low. Great town. Once you turn on your other senses, listen in to conversations and feel the mood, your Rip Van Winkle gets confused. Why all the gloom? Where's that almost American swagger of old? Back then, Jacques Delors, steely French mandarin, ruled this town, no longer as president of the European Commission that runs the EU \u2014 but in spirit. The Commission, molded in his image, had Delors' sense of pur - pose. The young came down from the College of Europe in Bruges and took fiercely competitive en - trance exams for those fabulous jobs \u2014 virtually tax-free pay, long holidays, civilizing mis - sion included. The euro, the first common currency of its kind, was here. The bloc was the most popular club in the world; every - one, even countries barely on the European land mass, wanted in. The original group of six mem - ber-states was about to swell to the 28 of today. The 78-day Koso - vo war ended a bloody decade in the Balkans, scraping off a bit of the moral stain for Europe's ab - dication on Bosnia. THE LAST MOHICANS A Continent free, whole and prosperous looked within reach: \"The European Dream,\" to bor - row from futurologist Jeremy Rifkin \u2014 whose book sales and speaking fees seem undented by a record of consistent misprognos - tication. The post-post-modern era promised pooled sovereignty, peaceful cooperation, soft power and social justice. America's cen - tury was closing \u2014 Europe is \"the new superpower\" (the subtitle of one book published around then), its \"vision of the future is quietly eclipsing the American dream\" (the subtitle of Rifkin's) and \"Eu - rope will run the 21st century\" (the title of another). I can't find this Brussels, and ask a former member of a Com - mission cabinet who went back to a top job in his national capi - tal where to look. \"The mojo is gone,\" he says. The dream has been deferred, possibly killed. The danger signals were, of course, all there. The real and imagined democratic deficit in Europe spurred on populist par - ties. When Joerg Haider's xeno - phobic Freedom Party came in second in the 2000 Austrian parliamentary elections, the EU imposed sanctions on Vienna, turning voters even more against Europe's meddling ways. The Haider brand of politics is rising almost every way you turn in Europe (the man himself since deceased). \"Europe\" is a convenient scapegoat for national ills, mostly economic. Hubris, as always, brought on the fall. In the early 2000s, the wise and distant of the Continent invoked Phil - adelphia and plotted to write a Constitution to seal the Union. French voters, soon after fol - lowed by the Dutch, murdered this idea with a stun - ning rejection in referendums that screamed \"No\" at those who would dilute their national sov - ereignty. The usual messy treaty fix imposed most of the planned constitutional changes anyway, but the damage was lasting. The EU hit a break on the ambition to expand borders and build the United States of Europe. Then came the Greek crisis and a cou - ple of recessions. In the capitals, elected leaders took the reins back from Brussels, diminishing the Commission and the Euro - pean Council along the way. So here we are. My old friends who work for the EU talk about their jobs in terms both foreign and depressing. \"Euroskepticism is the main British export to Europe,\" says the veteran Brussels hand Geoff Meade, eminence blond of the press pack here, over coffee. \"There's no more of this 'we're all in this together spirit of '80s and '90s.' There's a greater real - ism about the EU.\" A few other differences strike you: In those days, the British and the French ran this town. Tony Blair, the British Euro - phile before he became the hated \"lackey\" of America, pushed the EU to perfect its single market and open doors to the east. His vision of a liberal and free trad - ing Europe seemed triumphant. The French, as ever, preserved prized jobs for their own and kept their language at an almost equal footing with English. These days you can't find a British eurocrat under the age of thirty with all the talk of \"Brexit\" (another ugly euroneologism). As for the French, I tell the legend - ary EU observer for the French daily Lib\u00e9ration Jean Quatremer that he's the Last Mohican who bemoans the setting of the sun on the French language and in - fluence in Brussels. He laughs. NEW MASTERS In their place are \u2014 nat\u00fcrlich \u2014 the Germans. And their side - kicks. When you heard Polish on the streets in the nineties, you were walking past a build - ing site. You still hear it from the construction workers blasting away on the metal encrusted egg \u2014 aka the new Council headquar - ters across from our office. But you also catch whiffs of it from young ambitious eurocrats in fashionable suits. Poland, my place of birth, was the hard case for Europe in Y2K: Too Catholic, nationalist, rural, politically divided for the EU. \"Officials from Slovenia, Estonia and Hungary,\" the star pupils of the post-Soviet entering class, worried that Poland would slow their meteoric rise to the First World, I read in an old clip of mine from 2000. Yes Hungary, today's skeptic of \"lib - eral democracy,\" friend of Putin and scourge of Brussels. \"I would have never thought Poland would become more important in the EU than Spain,\" points out a senior EU official, from a neutral country. Me neither. The other stunner for your visitor from the past is a paradox. As the euronatives bemoan the death of their historic call to construct a brave new Europe, this town is the center of the world as never before. Google and Gazprom, titans of diametrically opposed corporate cultures and ambitions \u2014 though both, come to think of it, are run by native Russians \u2014 find themselves at war with an unelected Danish official: Com - petition Commissioner Mar - grethe Vestager wants them to change the way they do business, and wields the power of the EU antitrust regime to get her way. What started with the EU's un - precedented move in 2001 to stop the marriage of GE-Honeywell \u2014 two American companies whose merger was waved through by the US Department of Justice \u2014 is now an assumed droit du seigneur , and hardly limited to competition policy. To layer on the snark, the trans-Atlantic di - vision of labor is America inno - vates, the EU regulates. That old calling of this town, the \"European project,\" may have gone. In its place is politics, uglier and at the same time more accessible. At every other meal you turn and meet a lobbyist. I knew the first few American law - yers to set up shop in Brussels. The white shoes from London and New York now occupy entire buildings near Parliament and the European quarter. The Chi - nese and Indians and Gulfies are here too, desperate to penetrate this bubble for business. The EU's everyone's largest trading partner, which helps explain why you have more embassies in Brussels than any other capital, including Washington. DREAM DEFERRED Naturally, another reason for all the attention is that the calendar lies. The 20th century isn't over, not in Europe. The inconceiv - able of the Brussels dream days is within the realm of the imagin - able: The rejection of democracy and rise of extremist parties, the breakup of nations, war with Russia \u2014 reality for Ukraine, which so desperately wanted to get through the gates of the EU and NATO, firmly shut for now \u2014 and the return of German he - gemony in Europe. The last of course is here, minus a German military. (Let's give thanks for small mercies.) I share my impression with a couple of people around town. The British official Jonathan Faull, who's held possibly every single top job at the European Commission, thinks back to his arrival in 1979 and remembers a provincial village, almost entire - ly French-speaking. \"There were only a couple places you might find an international newspaper,\" he says. Anthony Gardner was a stagia - ire \u2014 an intern \u2014 at the Commis - sion in 1990. Delors was actually in office then. His Golden Era of the \"project\" was brighter than mine in the late nineties. He re - turned as the American ambas - sador to the EU, he says, to quite another town. You can say for sure that Brus - sels will look mostly the same \u2014 and yet feel utterly unrecogniz - able \u2014 in 15 years as well. 14POLITICO THURSDAY, APRIL 23, 2015 The 'dream' is dead.

Matthew Kaminski is executive editor of POLITICO in Brussels.ForumPOLITICO THURSDAY, APRIL 23, 2015 15 DC Digest The GOP frontrunner? It's not Jeb Bush With one well-received January speech in Iowa, Scott Walker shot to the top of the polls. After a suc - cessful campaign launch, Marco Rubio is slowly gaining ground with donors and with conserva - tives who see a candidate with an inspiring biography and excep - tional skills as a communicator. Yet it's Jeb Bush who's fre - quently described as the front - runner in a crowded field of more than a dozen Republican candi - dates. The reality is that he's not \u2014 at this stage in the nominating contest, no one is. \"The Republican nomination is wide open,\" said Ana Navarro, a Miami-based strategist who is close to Bush. \"We'll try many fla - vors of the month before we settle on one.\" Bush, the former Florida gov - ernor who hasn't run for office in 13 years, seemed impressive right out of the gate with his sudden, aggressive moves last November. He sent strong enough signals to box out Mitt Romney, the 2012 nominee who'd been toying with a third run for the White House, began securing commitments from GOP operatives to work on his eventual campaign and from the donors needed to fund it. Based on the early show of strength, Bush was anointed the \"clear Republican frontrunner\" last December, referencing a poll showing him leading the field with 23 percent of the overall Republican vote nationwide. Now, as the field is beginning to take shape and voters are hearing more about other candi - dates, it's clear that Bush is sit - ting right there on the starting line with everyone else: Walker, Rubio, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Chris Christie and more than a dozen second-tier candidates less likely to affect the battle for the nomination.From his position on Common Core to immigration reform to his family name, it's become abundantly clear Bush has a lot to overcome. For all the substance and thoughtfulness he's brought to the enterprise to date, many Republicans simply hunger for a younger, fresher face \u2014 and more ardently conservative stances from the party's next standard bearer. \"No voter has ever raced to put a bumper sticker on their car because a candidate has the most money and best organization,\" said Kevin Madden, a GOP strate - gist who advised Romney in 2012. \"They want someone with a bold vision who can provide a new direction and offer a stark contrast to Hillary Clinton.\" Bush's challenges were evident this past weekend in New Hamp - shire, a state he may have to win, where he performed flawlessly over three days last week yet seemed to generate less excite - ment from audiences than several of his rivals. He responded smartly to a woman who stood up during a Politics and Eggs event at St. An - selm College and told him she didn't want a coronation, saying he doubted one was coming his way. But even the right answer and pitch-perfect tone couldn't dispel the dynastic aura sur - rounding a man whose father and brother have both been elected president - especially with large framed photographs of them hanging high on the walls around the meeting room. \"It's going to be tough for Bush to be the shiny new thing in the way that a Rubio or a Walker could be,\" said Dante Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire. After holding forth for nearly an hour and demonstrating fluen - cy on a range of policy areas, Bush met the press in a small room down the hall; the questions fo - cused on nagging political issues - the Bush brand and whether Rubio, who Bush mentored as a young Florida lawmaker, stabbed his friend in the back by entering the presidential race. \"Can you compare your foreign policy approach to your broth - er's?\" asked one reporter. \"No,\" Bush replied.It's not a question Bush will be able to avoid. But campaign advisers believe the 10 months from now until the start of prima - ry season will be enough time to address the differences between Jeb and his brother, to clarify his own ideas and beliefs so that, in the end, people see a candidate who is his own man and willing to work for the nomination. If Bush can no longer claim the mantle of frontrunner, it's due at least in part to rise of some of his rivals, and the early traction they've gained. Walker, the Wis - consin governor, has a recent re - cord of conservative reform and shows potential to win support from the more moderate GOP es - tablishment and the party's Tea Party base. Rubio, the Florida senator, looks to have the backing of enough well-heeled donors to build a serious organization. He appeals to a wide swath of conser - vatives who like his hawkishness on foreign policy and recognize that his unique charisma and inspiring biography could make him a formidable general election candidate. Few doubt Bush, who's ex - pected to raise more money than any other candidate in the field, is built for the long haul. His ability to build a broader, more diverse coalition and his resources will enable him to run a campaign in much larger and more expensive states like Florida \u2014 where a week of TV ads airing statewide will run at least $3 million. But first he must run the early state gauntlet, where the conser - vative grass roots in states like Iowa and South Carolina aren't yet enamored of him. That makes New Hampshire, where Bush is better situated, a critical test. At the moment, Bush trails Walker in the polls in all of those three states. \"The early states don't come easy,\" said Stuart Stevens, who managed Romney's 2012 cam - paign. \"If you want to win the nomination, you've got to win one of the first four.\" Unlike Romney in 2012, Bush may not be able to count on his rivals collapsing and voters com - ing home to him - a less exciting, but safe choice - for lack of viable options. \"I'm impressed by the quality of the field,\" Scala said. \"It's not Mitt Romney and a bunch of B-list, C-list candidates; it's a qual - ity field. I can imagine that activ - ists are just kind of enjoying the buffet at this point.\" Charles and David Koch are con - sidering throwing their massive wealth and sophisticated organi-zation into the Republican presi - dential primary for the first time, a potentially game-changing boost that could make even a second-tier candidate instantly viable. In another surprise, a top Koch aide revealed to POLITICO that Jeb Bush will be given a chance to audition for the brothers' sup - port, despite initial skepticism about him at the top of the Kochs' growing political behemoth. Sen. Marco Rubio, Sen. Rand Paul and Sen. Ted Cruz debated at the Koch network's winter semi - nar in January, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker made a sepa - rate appearance. Those were the candidates who appeared to have a chance at the Koch blessing, and attendees said Rubio seemed to A crowded Republican field has yet to begin really shaking out By ELI STOKELS By MIKE ALLENJeb Bush is attracting much of the media attention, but don't be fooled into thinking that he is the only Republican in with a shot of securing the presidential nomination. GETTY IMAGES Koch brothers to size up Republican race, offer Bush audition win that round. But those four \u2014 plus Jeb Bush \u2014 will be invited to the Kochs' summer conference, the aide said. Bush is getting a second look because so many Koch supporters think he looks like a winner. Other candidates, perhaps Rick Perry or Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, may also get invitations. The New York Times' Nick Confessore reported Monday af - ternoon that David Koch had in - dicated the brothers favor Walk - er, citing remarks he made to donors who had just heard from the Wisconsin governor. The ar - ticle runs on page A13 of the print edition: \"G.O.P. Donors Signal a Favorite: Wisconsin Governor.\" This prompted an online frenzy, including the HuffPost banner, \"KOCHS FIND THEIR MAN.\" Koch insiders dismissed that conclusion, saying the brothers have made similar comments about several of the candidates, and are far from settling on a favorite. \"It's really early, and a lot is going to happen,\" the aide said. \"We wouldn't want to take options off the table by getting behind one of them now.\"David Koch said in a statement to POLITICO's Ken Vogel: \"While I think Gov. Walker is terrific ... I am not endorsing or supporting any candidate for president at this point.\" As part of the Kochs' screening process, favored can - didates may also be invited to speak at a major gathering staged by the brothers' network, such as an Americans for Prosperity summit. The brothers are likely to make a decision about whether to pick a horse many months from now, so that they have time to see how the candidates perform in de - bates, how they articulate issues the Kochs care about, and how strong a staff they have assembled. The Kochs and their advis - ers will be looking for a candi - date who is \"solid on economic-freedom issues,\" is \"a passionate advocate for free markets,\" and has \"a positive, optimistic, pro-freedom message,\" the aide said.A candidate will get consider - able extra credit for being on the brothers' side of reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank, which Koch organizations are spending big to oppose. The brothers are likely to make a selection after the field has been winnowed to a few can - didates, perhaps giving their pick a boost against the establishment favorite. The Kochs have resisted jumping into presidential prima - ries in the past because they ques - tioned the value of the invest - ment. But last cycle, they were left with Mitt Romney, who didn't excite their network's donors. \"It was a fait accompli,\" the aide said. \"Do you help out, or not? Relative to Obama? Sure. Do you want to be faced with that choice again? Probably not.\" This article was originally published on POLITICO .com James Hohmann and Cate Martel contributed to this report.

While there is not much of a mystery over the outcome, the size of Komorowski's likely vic - tory, and whether he has to go into a runoff on May 24 if he fails to win an outright victory on May 10, does have an enormous significance. Both the centrist ruling Civic Platform party (PO), allied with Komorowski, and the right-wing opposition Law and Justice party (PiS) are hoping the presidential poll gives them a boost in this fall's crucial parlia - mentary election. Komorowski, 62, whose avun - cular, smiling, everyman style belies his aristocratic roots, has hit a chord with the public dur - ing his first five-year term and is easily Poland's most popular politician. His background as an opposition activist during com - munist times, then service in positions including defense min - ister after the fall of the Berlin Wall, also give him credibility in today's more dangerous geopo - litical environment. Komorowski's closest rival, 42-year-old Andrzej Duda, is a backbench MEP hand-picked by party founder Jarosaw Kaczyski, who has had trouble in the past breaking through to moderate voters. Kaczyski has traditionally been suspicious of ambitious rivals who could sup - plant him as leader, but Duda is being talked of as a potential successor when the 65-year-old decides to retire. That point could arrive sooner if the parlia - mentary election brings another defeat for PiS. Komorowski has run a lack -luster campaign, relying on his personal popularity rather than providing fresh policies. That has won him support of about 45 percent in opinion polls; Duda is polling around 25 percent, with the rest of the candidates in sin - gle digits. At least initially, Ko - morowski appeared to take his re-election for granted. When Komorowski announced his candidacy he read some scripted notes while Civic Platform big - wigs chatted in the audience, barely paying attention. Despite its national mandate, the office itself has limited pow - ers; the president can veto legis - lation, formally heads the armed forces and has a role in foreign affairs, but has no real say in formulating policy. That has encouraged the major parties to look at the election as a dress rehearsal for the parliamen - tary poll, which will determine whether PO extends its eight-year reign \u2014 already a record in post-communist politics \u2014 for another four years. DIVISIONS The line between PO and PiS reflects deep divisions in Polish society: wealthier, more urban, Brussels-oriented Poles in the PO, and PiS's base of Euroskep - tic, more traditionalist Roman Catholic voters, with stronger support in the poorer east of the country. The watershed issue is the 2010 plane crash that killed Komorowski's predecessor, Lech Kaczyski, Jarosaw's identical twin brother. The martyrology surrounding the crash inflames passions among PiS supporters, who regularly commemorate the event with marches and reli - gious ceremonies. Most Poles see the govern - ment airliner crash in Smolensk, Russia, as a tragic accident, caused by an incompetent re - sponse to bad weather. But PiS appeals to the significant minor - ity who see it in darker shades \u2014 an assassination by some combination of shadowy forces including Russia and the current Polish government. The depth of the divide and the numbers on each side mean the election is Komorowski's to lose, and he has capitalized on it, describing a split between \"ratio - nal Poland\" and \"radical Poland.\" Komorowski's attempt to market himself as a safe pair of hands can also be seen in his slogan: \"Choose harmony and security\". In response, Duda charges that Komorowski's presidency has been too passive and symbolic; he pledges that if elected he won't just \"sit under a chandelier\" \u2014 a dig at Komorowski's blue-blooded pedi - gree. Still, the challenger has tried to distance himself from some of the wackier elements of PiS; he was notably absent from the par - ty's commemorations of the plane crash. \"Poles generally don't respect politicians, but they respect Komorowski,\" says Olgierd An - nusewicz, deputy director of the University of Warsaw's Political Science Analysis Center. He cites two main reasons: Komorowski's attempt to remain above the fray of parliamentary politics, and his image as an ordinary Pole. On the issues, both leading candidates support a stronger EU response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. On social policy, Ko - morowski is more liberal than Duda. He backs a bill before par - liament regulating in-vitro fertil - ization, and signed the Council of Europe's convention on prevent - ing violence against women. Duda opposes the convention, saying it needlessly introduces legal con - cepts that conflict with Poland's traditional gender and family roles. This, of course, fits with the more hardline Roman Catholic view popular among PiS voters. In addition to hot-button so - cial issues, Duda has also tried to capitalize on Poles' skepticism toward the euro \u2014 which has grown thanks to crisis and dis - array in the eurozone. He warns Komorowski supports rapid adoption of the single currency. The opposition candidate posed for cameras in a mock-up of a shop showing how the euro could send food prices soaring, based on dubious data from neighbor - ing Slovakia. That's a red her - ring. The president has marginal influence on economic policy. FOCUS The key issue for the euro lies elsewhere. It's not certain par - liamentary elections will return a majority that can amend the constitution to allow the switch, says Micha Dybua, an econo - mist with BNP-Paribas in War - saw. A two-thirds majority of the lower house of parliament needs to amend the constitution, which currently gives the central bank responsibility for mon - etary policy. The division between PiS and PO also shows how Polish politics breaks down differently from the right/left divide in many other countries. While PiS is known for staunch Catholic social policies such as opposi - tion to abortion and domestic partnerships, the party is leftist on economic policy, with a statist vision of national champions in domestic industry and a strong welfare state. That has helped marginalize the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), the successor to the communist-era ruling party. Of course, the SLD has also worked hard to diminish itself. Its long-downward slide started with a series of corruption scan - dals under the 2001-2004 gov - ernment of Leszek Miller. While the 68-year-old former appa - ratchik remains in control of the party, his handpicked presi - dential candidate is 35-year-old Magdalena Og\u00f3rek. Billed by the party as a sign of its openness to the next generation, she's widely derided as a lightweight whose nomination was a transparent publicity stunt. Selected on Jan - uary 9, she took her first ques - tion from journalists on March 2. In the meantime playboy.com asked: \"Is this beautiful woman the next president of Poland?\" Probably not. Og\u00f3rek is polling around 5 percent. That places her behind two right-wing candidates: MEP Ja - nusz Korwin-Mikke, a bow-tied former bridge champion who says Poland should stop antago - nizing Russia over Ukraine, and Pawe Kukiz, a rock star turned political activist calling for an end to proportional representa - tion. If the two manage to join forces before the autumn elec - tion, they could enter parliament with support of 10-15 percent, possibly setting up a coalition with PiS to form a majority, says Kazimierz Kik, director of the Political Science Institute at Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce, Poland. For now, though, Poles look set to choose Komorowski to continue the political stability that is set to deliver GDP growth of around 3 percent this year, one of the fastest rates in the EU. \"Komorowski is a guarantee of political stabilization; he's not a fighter,\" says Kik. \"I don't know whether he'll be a sufficient balm to soothe the country's political conflict, but he certainly won't make things worse.\"The depth of the divide and the numbers on each side mean the election is Komorowski's to loseBy NATHANIEL ESPINO Poland is captivated by the forthcoming presidential election. EPA The outcome of May's presidential election is not a mystery, but it lays the groundwork for a fierce contest for control of parliamentSPONSORED CONTENT The European Union may be emerging from the darkest days of the economic crisis, but on the ground, it doesn't always feel that way. Growth in Europe is still stagnant. High un - employment refuses to subside and compa - nies remain hesitant to invest. According to a recent report from BusinessEurope, Europe's share of foreign direct investment has more than halved since 2000 to 17%, while China's share has risen from 3-9% in the same period. European investment is estimated to have dropped by \u20ac380 billion since 2008, and businesses remain hesitant. This despite an estimated \u20ac3 trillion in corporate cash sitting in hold. Europe does not have a liquidity prob - lem, it has a confidence problem. So how can Europe get its mojo back? The European Commission believes that a new \u20ac300 billion investment fund, spearheaded by Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, will do the trick. But business lead - ers are concerned that the fund could fail to stimulate the right projects. Marco Annunziata, the chief economist of GE (General Electric), a US headquartered conglomerate with over 90,000 employees and significant business activity in Europe, says that while he's supportive and \"very positive\" about the Juncker plan because of it's emphasis on infrastructure, he has two concerns about the fund. First, he worries that the initial list of pos - sible projects is too dominated by legacy proj - ects rather than new ones which are laser-focused on driving growth. \"A number of the projects being considered tend to be older projects that haven't gone through before,\" he says. \"It's going to be important to take a hard look at these projects and understand why they did not take off before.\" He is also concerned that money is be - ing diverted to the Juncker plan from exist - ing EU funds for research and development. \"That would be absolutely wrong, R&D is not the area where we should be taking money out,\" he says. 30% or \u20ac1 billion of GE's an - nual R&D budget is invested in Europe, and one-third of GE's patents are filed here. About 60% of the company's global acquisitions, over one billion dollars, since 2000 have been in Europe. Meanwhile it is awaiting approval on a proposed alliance with French company Alstom. Annunziata says the fund alone can't solve Europe's stagnation problem. \"Where you have some institutional constraints, where there are more uniform regulations needed, the investment alone will not solve the prob - lem,\" he says. These sentiments were also expressed in an 'attractiveness survey' issued last year by audit firm EY. The report noted that while the Eurozone's recession had on paper ended in the second quarter of 2013, investors are still holding back until they see \"a more integrat - ed, 'single' Europe.\" 43% of businesses surveyed said they are factoring the \"stability and transparency of the political, legal and regulatory environment be -fore taking an investment decision in Europe\", while 37% primarily assess the region's mar - ket size and dynamics. The EU needs structural reforms to im - prove productivity, and the Eurozone needs more financial and economic integration, says Annunziata. \"We need to create a common market for innovation, and we need to make sure that the Eurozone integration process is completed. To me these are the two basic sets of conditions. If those were to take place, everything else would fall into place.\" Business leaders say an investment fund alone will not solve Europe's growth prob - lem - the conditions for investment need to be changed. BusinessEurope's annual reform barometer for 2015, issued last month, noted that the overall tax burden in the EU remains over 50% higher than in the US and over 25% higher than in Japan. The cost of starting a business in the EU is more than triple that of the US, while it takes businesses about twice as long to set up a company in the EU. The EU is the only economy where per capita in - vestment in broadband fell between 2008 and 2013. \"Too many countries have not put into practice the lesson that reform works,\" says Markus Beyrer, director-general of Busi - nessEurope. \"Europe is losing ground in terms of competitiveness with the US, China, India and Japan. We risk experiencing a period of low growth and high unemployment unless all member states get serious about reform\". For Europe's confidence to return, it will need more than just money. A framework is needed, both at EU and national level, to create the right conditions for investment and growth.Europe needs reform to spur new investment'Propelling Europe forward,' a series brought to you by GEPOLITICO THURSDAY, APRIL 23, 2015 17 Developing Asia 31% 28% Europe %81 20% Latin America and North 15% 4%2013 Sou rce: UNCTAD.2012FDI inflows by major region % share of global FDI inflows (value in \u20ac billion) Source: EY's 2014 European attractiveness survey (total respond ents: 808).

More information will be available very soon on Politico.eu.Sou rce: UNCTAD.2009 THURSDAY, APRIL 23, 2015 Forum Ukraine has embarked on an economic transi - tion the outcome of which will determine the country's future. Other states have traveled this path already, but not in conditions as challenging as the ones we face. We are burdened with a legacy that includes 74 years of totalitarian rule and dysfunctional command economics, 19 years of inad - equate reforms and sclerotic leadership and four years of outright kleptomania under former President Yanu - kovych. Critically, Russia's undeclared war has caused humanitarian and economic devastation on a vast scale. The conditions for launch - ing a program of reform designed to create a modern, free and prosperous Euro - pean democracy could hardly be less auspicious, yet that is precisely what we have cho - sen to do. Without modern weapons to defend ourselves and financial resources to overcome our severe eco - nomic crisis, we are taking control of our own fate by dismantling the structures of post-Soviet corruption that have held Ukraine back and creating a new path of development based on private enterprise, competitiveness, transparency and the rule of law. We are confident of success because we have a President, Government and coalition majority in the Parliament committed to reforms, backed by an active and vocal civil society that is no longer willing to settle for the old status quo. To suc -ceed, our reforms must be swift and bold. Nothing has done more to distort the economic and political priorities of Ukraine since independence than a corrupt and inefficient energy sector. That is why we have made it a priority target of reform. We have slashed the deficit of our state-owned energy monopoly, Naftogaz, from about $10bn to $1.5bn in just one year and plan to eliminate that deficit by the end of 2016. We have achieved this major improvement in financial performance by reducing energy consump - tion, improving efficiency and diversifying supply to receive almost two-thirds of our gas imports from the EU. New legislation has been adopted to unbundle Naftogaz and bring Ukraine into line with the competition rules of the EU's Third Energy Package. We are also stamping out graft by eliminating the past practice of opaque interme - diary companies. We have just increased residential gas tariffs by 450% and are intro - ducing tailored energy subsi - dies to the most vulnerable. This will massively improve energy efficiency, end unac - ceptable corrupt arbitrage schemes and provide support to those in need instead of the wealthiest and largest gas consumers. Vital changes that have been talked about for years are finally happen - ing. Our fiscal reform plan aims to broaden the tax base and share the burden more fairly, while rewarding en - trepreneurship with a more business-friendly tax system. We are doing this by bringing commercial activity out of the shadow economy with payroll tax breaks and reducing the number of taxes from 20 to 11. We are ensuring that ev - erybody pays their fair share by closing fiscal loopholes and getting rid of transfer pricing. A new electronic VAT system has been introduced to increase transparency and reduce fraud, which cost the government upwards of $1 billion last year. We are also embarking on a fresh and holistic review of our tax poli - cies and administration to encourage both domestic and foreign businesses to invest in Ukraine again. Strengthening the rule of law is at the core of our reform program. In the finan - cial sector, we have adopted legislation to rescue failing banks quickly and reduce the exposure of our financial sys - tem to fraudulent third-party transactions and insider deals. It will now be easier to prosecute and recover assets from bank owners and those involved in financial crimes, while protecting depositors. We have set up a new Nation - al Anti-Corruption Bureau, independently appointed and fully funded at Western salary levels, to investigate corruption by government employees, public officials and private legal entities. In addition, we have started reforming our police forces and judicial system. Many more fundamental structural reforms have been imple - mented and even more are to be enacted in the coming weeks and months. We greatly appreciate the support we have received from the EU, the US, the IMF and other international part - ners, underpinning our finan -cial stability with significant multilateral and bilateral aid. Private creditors also need to play their part by agreeing a debt restructuring deal that ensures our long-term finan - cial sustainability. Although existing levels of assistance are helping Ukraine to over - come the current crisis, they will not be sufficient to enable us to fully recover and flour - ish. For that we are going to need more political and eco - nomic support in the form of bilateral loans, humanitarian assistance and help to mod - ernize and strengthen our defense capabilities. We will also need additional private sector investment in key seg - ments of our economy such as energy, agriculture and infra - structure. Last but not least, we believe it is crucial that the EU maintains sanctions until Russia complies with its international obligations. Full implementation of the Minsk II agreements is key to a lasting peace. Acting now to support Ukraine and the Ukrainians who are building prosperity and stability is a wise long-term investment for the EU. It is in no one's interest to risk the prospect of a failed state in the heart of Europe. Ukrainians today are giving their lives to protect Europe and defend freedom and democracy. If, on our con - tinent, we fail to defend the values that are the bedrock of European civilization, what kind of world will we be living in tomorrow?

Getty Angela Merkel will still be German chancellor when, and if, Hillary Clinton moves into the White House for the second time on January 20, 2017. The two of them won't have to size each other up. They know each other already, because they know themselves. America and Europe, with Merkel as uncrowned empress, would be led by sisters-in-spirit \u2014 a first in transatlantic history. If Clinton ran for office in Europe, she would win hands down \u2014 as an American ver - sion of Angela Merkel. The two women seem unlikely political twins. After all, they hail from backgrounds as far apart as the places where they grew up: Clinton in Chicago and Merkel in the backwater of Templin in former East Germany. Hillary Rodham went to Wellesley, an exclu - sive college near Boston, then to Yale Law School. By contrast, Angela Merkel grew up in modest circumstances. The daughter of a protestant pastor, she joined the Com - munist Youth, then studied physics at the University of Leipzig. And yet their rise to the top followed similar trajectories. Call it bound - less ambition paired with ideological agility. A dozen years ago, Christian Demo - crat Merkel made her mark as a German doppelg\u00e4nger of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, touting free mar - kets, deregulation and small government. Quickly sensing that the German elector - ate preferred social safety, redistribution and a mu - nificent state, she moved left and kept moving. Today, as the quip goes, she is the best social-democratic chancellor Germany has ever had. Clinton went the same way, though from the opposite direction. Starting out on the left of the Democratic Party, the First Lady pushed an am - bitious social welfare agenda, with 'Hillarycare', a compul - sory national health scheme, as centerpiece. When it ran into indomitable opposition, she quickly ditched the idea. Critical of Israel, she became a fervent friend of the Jewish state when she ran for senator in New York in 2000 \u2014 the state with the largest Jewish population in the country. The Economist sums it all up: \"For somebody who has been on the national stage for a quarter-century, her beliefs are strangely hard to pin down.\" Her former senate colleague Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, puts it more starkly. She is \"the most opaque person you'll ever meet in your life.\" Clinton's unspoken motto might well be: \"I'll be whatev - er you want me to be\" \u2014 what - ever it takes to win the biggest prize of them all. Merkel, now in her third term as chancel - lor, would nod. Her political faith is as flexible as Clinton's, and her knack for rolling with the electoral mood has served her well. If she runs again in 2017 (and she will), she will win once more and rack up 16 years in office. If Merkel's sister-in- smoothness ran in Europe, she would win as well. Listen to Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German foreign minister: \"In these turbulent times, it is so important to have somebody at the helm who won't be driven by ideological extremes.\" Like George W., or Barack Obama, he meant to say. The kudos pile up. She is a \"friend\" of Germany and Europe; she \"knows how to listen.\" That is as strong an endorsement from the leading power in Europe as can be.A headline in the Berlin tabloid BZ blares: \"President Clinton would be a blessing for America and the world.\" Denmark's Politiken praises offer \"unrealistic promises\" \u2014 an - other dig at Obama. She will be a \"good president,\" opines Germany's national daily, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. \"Good luck,\" tweeted former French president Nicolas Sarkozy. Current foreign minister Laurent Fabius hyped Clinton as \"an exceptional woman for a job that requires exceptional qualities.\" That's as far as one can get in intervening in the politics of another nation. Europe's \"Hillary for Pres - ident\" zeal stems from two sources \u2014 one ideological, the other personal. Putting it crudely, the mantra runs: \"Republicans bad, Demo - crats good.\" In the European mind, \"Republican\" stands for all kinds of unpleasant stuff: tea Party, unbounded capitalism, social injus - tice, military adventurism, reactionary cultural politics. Democrats, by contrast, are \"more like us\": pro-minor - ities, religiously tolerant, socially progressive. It is kin - ship versus \"un-European\" convictions. The personal sympathy for Clinton is fueled by eight years of Bush and six years of Obama, whom Europe - ans had cheered as rock star and redeemer back in 2008. Naturally, adulation breeds disenchantment first and resentment later. In real life, \"Yes, we can!\" and the \"audacity of hope\" segued into a presidency that appeared weak, indecisive and na\u00efve, especially in view of a resur - gent Russia, an expansive China and Islamist terror. Europeans dislike dis - plays of American power, but even less did they cher - ish an America that was turning its back on Europe and withdrawing from the Middle East. Yes, Obama had promised a \"kinder and gentler\" America. But why did the Administration refuse to close Guantanamo? Why did the president kill more people with stand-off weap - ons than George W. had ever done? Obama got it coming and going: too weak to act as \"leader of the free world,\" too mean-spirited in the pursuit of selfish American interests. Sum it up as \"isolationism with drones.\" Hence the enthusiasm for Clinton. Europeans think they know her, as they did not know W., the trans - planted Texan, or Obama, who seemed to come out of nowhere. As a Democrat, she would share Europe's cultural values \u2014 not like Jeb Bush or any other of those Republicans crowding into the ring. And yet, this European 'Hillarism' falls short of a tsunami. Those whose memo - ries go back further than yesterday's news cycle recall the scandal-ridden past of the Clintons \u2014 first in Arkansas, then in the White House (1993-2001). They recall Hill - ary & Bill as power politicians both ruthless and menda - cious. Merkel, by contrast, has led a scandal-free life \u2014 that is the biggest difference between her and Mrs. C. Wistfully, Britain's leftish Guardian calls Clinton's can - didacy \"welcome,\" but then gives vent to ambivalence. Too much was \"unknown about how she would ... govern.\" So the paper pleads for wide-open, competitive primaries \"that could force her to spell out her plans.\" Gingerly, the sympathetic Guardian concludes: \"Po - litical contests are, almost invariably, to be preferred to political coronations.\" Let me end on a personal note.

I imagine myself arriving in Moscow after a long absence. For the past ten years I couldn't visit because I've been deemed a traitor and an enemy of the peo - ple, but recently a slight d\u00e9tente has set in; I come as a guest of the Committee for Cultural Ties with Compatriots. I decide to accept. I am eager to see my native town again. It is not difficult for me to vi - sualize this Moscow-1. I've been there before. I grew up in the USSR, my memories are vivid. It feels like a time-warp, a leap into the past. A severe border guard tries to check my passport through an antiquated computer system, but the autonomous \"Rusnet\" doesn't work properly, so I have to wait for several minutes un - der the benevolent scrutiny of the Great Leader \u2014 his huge portrait hangs in the booth. While I've gotten older over the past ten years, the Great Leader keeps getting younger. His fore - head is smooth, his generalis - simo epaulettes glittering. I am met by my guide, who regards me warily at first, but soon relaxes. Whispering so that our driver can't hear, he tells me a new one about how our Great Leader sees off the Great Leader of North Korea in the airport, gives him a kiss, and then waves his hand for a long, long time. When asked why, he answers dreamily: \"Oh, what a kiss that was!\" I smile sourly. I'd heard that one half a century ago. About Brezhnev and Honecker, the then leader of the German Dem - ocratic Republic. The noisy Volga sedan rat - tles over the holes in the pave - ment. The shabbiness of the streets is masked by innumer - able posters, orange-black and white-blue-red. There are no commercial advertisements, only slogans and portraits of the Great Leader. I see him on a horse, in the cabin of a fighter jet, surrounded by happy chil - dren, shaking hands with a grateful pensioner. In the hall of the Intourist Hotel, while my guide checks me in, a sneaky young man pulls me by my sleeve. He wants to sell me rubles at a rate five times better than the official one. Then I walk to the street where I lived for so many years.My old apartment house has not been renovated. Huge vintage air conditioners are still there, covered in rust. I pass what used to be the Museum of Tolerance, now the Museum of Patriotism. Then I see a long queue in front of a food store. I read the notice on the door: \"Chinese canned beef! Two cans max. per buyer. Food coupons not valid.\" Back in my hotel I watch the news. It's all about the second trial of the infamous \"Medvedev Gang.\" The former president and his ministers confess to having been CIA agents and to practis - ing outlawed homosexual acts. They beg for clemency. Judg - ing by the tone of the reportage, they won't be getting any. I shiver. I open the fridge and drink everything I can find there: the lousy Dagestan bran - dy and the vodka \"Putinka.\" Enough. I'll stop describing - Moscow-1 here, before I have to start drinking.When China's Ming dynasty first came into contact with a new nation approaching its border from the north \u2014 Rus - sia \u2014 Chinese officials had to choose the right hieroglyphs to name it. They called it , which translates as \"Country of Unpredictability.\" One can only admire the foresight of those 17th century bureaucrats. They identified the angry nerve of Russia's anatomy with the precision of a virtuoso chiropractor. Yes, my dear country is unpredictable. I have lived all my life, until very recently, in its capi - tal. But a simple question about what Moscow might be like in ten years, a short span of time, in truth, leaves me at a loss. Perhaps Russia's state symbol \u2014 the two-headed eagle \u2014 could serve as another explanation for my uncertainty. The be - wildered mutant doesn't know which way to look, to the East or to the West, and keeps trying to fly in opposite directions. I start with this pre - amble because I feel I must explain why, when I mentally superimpose the name \"Moscow\" with the number \"2025\", I see not one town, but two, resem - bling each other no more than Mr. Hyde resembles Dr. Jekyll. I'll call those two imagi - nary cities of the not-so-distant future \"Moscow-1\" and \"Moscow-2.\"If life in my country goes back to normalcy (which I hope it will), I think that by 2025 Mos - cow will be the most interesting place in the world. Not the most beautiful or the most wealthy or the most comfortable city, oh no, but one that is bustling with energy. No wishful thinking here, just the plain laws of physics. By \"normalcy\" I mean freedom. When a big country becomes free after a long period of sup - pression, it's like a steel spring let loose. The air vibrates with adrenaline, everything moves, everything changes. The brain drain of the previ - ous decade has reversed its flow; professionals, entrepreneurs and intellectuals are returning home to Russia. That's where big money is made now, that's where things happen. I won't be noticing how my town has changed because I have been there for the whole decade. As a writer, I've been feasting on all the pent-up en - ergy and freshness. I write dif - ferently in this 2025, and I do not like to re-read my old stuff. It's another Russia, another Moscow, another me. It's April 22, 2025 today. I re - alize it's Vladimir Ilyich Lenin's birthday. A sudden idea comes to mind. Why not go visit Len - in's Mausoleum? I haven't been there since childhood. It's quite a long drive, be - cause the mausoleum was re - moved from Red Square long ago. Now it is the main attrac - tion of \"Sovietland,\" a park in a Moscow suburb where all the monuments of the totalitarian era were transplanted, a sort of historical Disneyland of the by - gone epoch. I walk along the al - leys, among Lenins, kolkhoznitsy, keepsakes from the time when I was a young pioneer. There's also a bronze Putin in a judo outfit, a work by the sculptor Zurab Tsereteli, cast some 20 years ago. That reminds me. I do not want to miss the press confer - ence, so I hurry back home. The judoist has just been re - leased from jail, having served only half of his term. I look at his wrinkled face on the TV screen. No, he has no intention of returning to politics, he says. Yes, he wants to spend all his time with his kids, to compen - sate for the years of absence. No, he cannot disclose the advance he received for his forthcoming memoirs. That's not fair, I think envi - ously. This schmuck's mem - oirs are sure to become an in - ternational bestseller, while my books do not sell at all. It's true that I write differently now, I write better than before, but young people think I am a writer from the past. I tell my - self that future generations will surely rediscover me again, but I know they won't. It's OK. I am indulgent to - wards my older self of 2025. As long as that guy feels no nostal - gia for the times when life was awful but his books sold well. I know, I know. In reality things usually end up somewhere between shining white and dis - mal black, in the gray zone. But not this time. No shades of gray for Moscow of 2025. It will be ei - ther this \u2014 or that. You'll see. Boris Akunin is the pen name of Grigory Shalvovich Chkhartishvili. He is an essayist, literary translator and writer of detective fiction.

Look closely and you can still nd some of the Victorian charm that attracted Charles Dickens to spend summers here. But this chilly early spring, Broad - stairs is something more important: ground zero in the ght for the future of the United Kingdom Independence Party \u2014 Britain's dominant anti-EU political force. And it's here that the fate of UKIP and its irrepressible leader, Nigel Farage, will be decided in the general election on May 7. Broadstairs, roughly halfway between London and Belgium, is the geographic center of the constitu - ency of Thanet South. Farage has said he will stand down as party leader if he does not win the seat. But Farage is involved in more than a political contest. This elec - tion marks the latest act in a 20- year long personal drama among three men who have dedicated their lives to getting Britain out of the EU. Craig Mackinlay, the Conser - vative Party candidate opposing Farage, was once a UKIP man himself. In fact, he and Farage, erstwhile friends and business associates, were early members of the party when it was set up by Professor Alan Sked. All three men have led UKIP, but only one \u2014 Farage \u2014 has turned it into his personal brand. Today, Sked is support - ing Mackinlay and hoping that Farage is consigned to the dust - bin of history. The dramatic rise of the Unit - ed Kingdom Independence Party is the story of British politics in the last decade. In 2005, the par - ty polled just over 2 percent of the vote. Today, thanks to Farage's aggressive leadership, opinion polls show it has replaced the Lib - eral Democrats as Britain's third -largest party. His UKIP bashes immigrants and attacks the EU. The approach is a million miles (or 1.6 million kilometers, depending on your point of view) from the founding vision of Sked, a professor of international his - tory at the London School of Economics.\"When I established the party it wasn't about prejudices \u2014 immigration was never an issue for us,\" Sked told POLITICO. His party had one core idea: Get Britain out of an EU that Sked believed had gone beyond its orig - inal purpose of a common market free-trading zone. In the beginning, relations between Sked and Farage were cordial and correct. \"We had a drink occasionally but weren't bosom buddies,\" the professor, a soft-spoken Scot, remembered. It is hard to imagine Sked, an intel - lectual, and Farage, a flamboyant former stockbroker, hanging out a lot. Mackinlay, an accountant with a passion for politics, seems like someone who would be com - fortable with both men. Today, Sked's bitterness is unmistakable. \"Dim\" is a word he frequently uses in interviews to describe his erstwhile colleague. Farage declined several requests for comment. The story of how Alan Sked lost control of the party \u2014 and how UKIP came to be so closely identied with Farage, his dia - metric opposite in temperament and political tactics \u2014 is the story of the growth of anti-EU feeling in the UK, and the correspond - ing eect on the UK's electoral politics, particularly those of the Conservative Party. Most leading gures in UKIP are, like Farage, former Tories. The only two MPs UKIP has ever had, Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, are Tory defectors. Sked is not of that tribe. He was never a Conservative (or even a conservative), but a man of center-left leanings. \"My political beginnings were in the Liberal party as a pro-European federalist,\" he recalled. Sked rst stood for parlia - ment as a Liberal in 1970, while completing his doctorate in his - tory at Oxford University, where his supervisor was the renowned leftist historian A.J.P. Taylor. He lost, and went to work building a distinguished academic career, with his passionate pro-Europe - an politics an essential part of his teaching. In 1981, at the LSE, he established what has become the world's largest European Studies program. Sked did as much as anyone in those Euroskeptic times \u2014 Margaret Thatcher was prime minister \u2014 to make the Euro - pean Union comprehensible to Britain's policymakers. The LSE European Studies program sponsored conferences, brought over speakers from Brussels, and facilitated student exchanges. But somewhere along the way, Professor Sked began to change his views. \"After 10 years of lis - tening to bureaucrats\" and mem - bers of the European Parliament \"I came to the conclusion that the EU was misconceived, undemo - cratic and a waste of money,\" Sked remembered. There was no road-to-Damas - cus moment of conversion from passionate pro-European to campaigning Euroskeptic. It was the cumulative weight of listening to the many people from Brussels and Strasbourg he had invited to LSE that changed Sked's thinking. \"The fattest man I had ever seen came to give a talk, he made the Michelin man look slim,\" Sked recalled. The man - Sked, now 67, can't remember his name \u2014 was the Commission's head of transport policy. As Sked tells the story, the man took out a map and gave a speech. \"'This is a map of Ireland. The Irish government wants to build all its roads on the west coast of Ireland. We say 'No' you must build all roads on the east coast of Ireland. All roads must lead to Brussels.' He had maps of other countries. Same thing. All roads must lead to Brussels...Why?\" Then there was an Italian Eu - ropean parliamentarian who was asked by a student, \"How many of your MPs are in the Maa? and he answered, in a matter of fact tone, 'about 12,' and I thought, Jesus....\" So Sked turned 180 degrees against the EU. He joined the Bruges Group, a lobbying think - tank that opposed the drive toward a closer, more federal Europe being led, as the 1980s turned into the 1990s, by French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The Bruges Group, Sked \"A/f_ter ten years of listening to bureaucrats... I became convinced that the EU was misconceived, undemocratic and a waste of money.\" Alan SkedThree men and a far-right party By MICHAEL GOLDFARB from LondonUK ELECTIONsoon realized, was more a \"Con - servative Party adjunct than an independent group.\" So, in 1991, he set up a new political party, the Anti-Federalist League. By then, a civil war over European policy had broken out in the Conservative Party. Thatcher had been deposed. Her successor, John Major, signed the Maastricht Treaty in February 1992, laying the groundwork for the euro. Despite Major's negoti - ating Britain's opt-out from the single currency \u2014 a considerable piece of diplomacy \u2014 Sked was in utter despair. Maastricht, he recalls, \"meant political federal - ism.\" Two months later, Major called a general election and Sked be - came a candidate for parliament once again. Among other Anti- Federalist League candidates was none other than Craig MacKin - lay. Both men lost. In 1993, after Parliament rati - ed Maastricht, Sked set up the United Kingdom Independence Party with a simple goal: A ref - erendum on British withdrawal from what was now the European Union. As the Tory civil war smol - dered along, UKIP was the main beneciary. A steady drip of Con - servative Party activists moved over to UKIP. But inside UKIP trouble brewed for Sked. The party seemed to be attracting fringe characters, and unabashed na - tionalists of the immigrant-bash - ing type. After the 1997 general elec - tion, when UKIP elded 197 can - didates and all of them lost, Sked claims that Farage manipulated him out of the leadership through legal and other means. He left the party saying it had attracted members who were \"racist and of the far-right.\" He has also claimed that Far - age once told him: \"We will never win the nigger vote. The nig-nogs will never vote for us.\" Farage has spent years denying he said that but the charge of racism made by, among others, British Prime Minister David Cameron, won't quite disappear. On some playing elds just south of Broadstairs, Sol Camp - bell, former Arsenal and Eng - land football great, recently led a coaching session with the Hugin Vikings' youth squads. It was a media event on behalf of Craig Mackinlay. Campbell's kickaround with kids was the lure that attracted some television crews. Reporters asked Mackinlay about Farage and the prospects of a referen - dum on Britain's continued mem - bership of the EU. Mackinlay replied that there is no need for UKIP now, since Cam - eron has pledged a referendum by POLITI CO THURSDAY, APRIL 23, 2015 /space.en23 From le/f_t: Alan Sked, Craig Mackinlay and Nigel Farage MONTAGE BY POLITICO/GETTY2017 if he is reelected. The best way to ensure the referendum takes place, the candidate said, is to elect the Tories. After the event, Mackinlay ex - plained to POLITICO the basis for his journey away from and back to the Conservative Party. \"I've never changed,\" the can - didate said. \"I'm the same politi - cal mindset I was back in 1992.\" In 1992, Mackinlay was an ad - mirer of Sked. He recalled seeing Sked being interviewed on BBC television, the previous year, call - ing for Britain's exit from the EU. He was impressed by Sked's argu - ments and sought him out. When Sked formed UKIP Mackinlay joined the party and when the founder was forced out by Farage, Mackinlay was briefly the party's interim leader. \"I gave up 13 years of my life to UKIP. But by 2005 it had changed,\" he said \"We had MEPs who were living the high life. We had 11 MEPs and two of them were in prison for fraud.\" Mackinlay laughed ruefully. \"I thought, 'This isn't what UKIP is about.'\" The light-bulb moment came in 2005 when he stood as a UKIP candidate for Parliament in the Gillingham constituency. He siphoned o enough votes from the Conservatives to allow Labour's candidate to win. So Mackinlay returned to the Con - servatives to work for a referen - dum from within the Tory party. He was not alone. \"I think increasingly Nigel saw UKIP as being all about Nigel,\" he said. \"It's interesting that most of the early people in UKIP are all gone, all gone back to the Conser - vatives.\" Well, not all. Sked founded yet another party, New Deal, in 2013, although it remains more an idea than a reality. It is as Euroskeptic as UKIP but left of center in do - mestic policies and emphasizes inclusiveness in its membership. Farage's brand of English na - tionalism might be enough to push him to victory in Thanet South. But current opinion polls show a three-horse race. Farage and Mackinlay \u2014 whom Sked is backing \u2014 are splitting the anti- EU vote and there is a strong pos - sibility the Labour Party candi - date, Will Scobie, could scoop the seat up. And while the party's found - ers ght amongst themselves, the UKIP moment may be passing. The most recent public opinion poll shows that a record number of Britons now say they would vote to stay in the EU rather than leave. Sked discounts this poll. \"I cannot see the UK still a member of the EU in ten years' time,\"he said. \"A vote on the issue will happen, if not in 2017 then later. A referendum will become stan - dard policy for the Tories and unless the economies of the Eu - rozone and UK grow remarkably well, there will be all sorts of is - sues regarding Europe, which will increase demand for a vote.\" Given the current problems in the eurozone and a reassertive Russia, he thinks the climate in which that vote is held will lead to Britons opting out of the EU. \"But,\" he added, \"I am a histo - rian, not a prophet.\" The UKIP promotion machine has been in full force ahead of the May 7 general election in the UK. GETTY IMAGES (2) \"An ambassador is a gentleman sent to lie abroad for the good of his country.\" It was an Eng - lish poet, as well as diplomat, Sir Henry Wooten, who coined this aphorism, over 400 years ago. Through the ages, many a diplo - mat \u2014 too many \u2014 has observed the maxim. Robert White was not one. White, who worked for seven presidents, served America by re - fusing to lie \u2014 holding rm even when pressured to sweep murder under the rug by the Reagan Ad - ministration \u2014 an act of principle and integrity that cost him his career. White, who died in Janu - ary at the age of 88, was sent by President Carter to El Salvador in 1980. As hard as it is to fathom to - day, at that time the tiny nation \u2014 White was fond of observing that it was possible to see the entire country from a helicopter at 9000 feet \u2014 was on the front burner of American foreign policy, as Syria, Iraq and ISIS, are today. The fear then was communism. In neigh - boring Nicaragua, the Sandinis - tas had overthrown the dictator - ship of Anastasio Somoza, whose family had ruled and looted the country for decades, with Ameri - can acquiescence. Washington was now wor - ried that El Salvador would be the next domino to fall into the Moscow-Havana-Managua orbit. The country had long been ruled by an alliance of the military and the oligarchy. With support from the country's peasants, a leftist- revolution led by students was growing. Carter tasked White with pre - venting a civil war by assembling a political center, something between the extremist right and revolutionary left. During White's conrmation hearings, Senator Jacob Javits, the moder - ate Republican from New York, urged him to be more than a tra - ditional ambassador. \"You really have to be an activist and take a chance with your career,\" Javits told White. He was and he did. White was a rarity among diplomats. He not only spoke his mind, he spoke it on the re - cord. During one brieng at the American embassy, after White, dressed in his diplomatic pin stripes, took his seat behind the microphones, the press ocer ex - plained the ground rules. \"This is for background,\" he began. White interrupted, \"Hell, no\u2014what I have to say is on the record! You can attribute to me.\" I arrived in El Salvador to report for the New York Times several months after White had taken up his post. He sought to wean me from calling him \"Mr. Ambassador,\" by responding, \"Mr. Journalist.\" The son of Irish immigrants, White enlisted in the Navy when he was 17 and served in the Pa - cic during World War II. When the war was over, he worked for two years to raise the money to attend college, at St. Michael's in Vermont. He then got a degree from Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, before entering the foreign service \u2014 Eisenhower was president, John Foster Dulles secretary of state. SHELTERING DEMOCRACY Twenty-ve years later, Presi - dent Carter's Secretary of State Cyrus Vance turned to White. \"Secretary Vance had chosen me specically to go to El Salvador because I liked the human rights policy of the Carter Administra - tion,\" White told me last year. \"I thought it gave us an opportunity to distance ourselves from dic - tators, which by denition, are unstable; and to shelter democ - racy, and allow the democratic elements in these dictatorships of that era to change.\" I interviewed White for a mini- documentary I was working on with RetroReport, the innova - tive online news organization that revisits and re-reports on old stories as a counterweight to sound-bite journalism. We talked for nearly two hours, and I came away thinking what a tragedy that no one had done an oral history with him. He still looked every inch the distinguished diplomat, dressed in a sport coat and tie; his gravelly baritone voice still had a trace of his New England roots, and his mind was as sharp as three decades earlier. He had not yet been diagnosed with the cancer that would kill him. White often clashed with Latin American dictators, from Para - guay's Stroessner to Nicaragua's Somoza \u2014 and with Washington. When he criticized the Chilean dictator General Augusto Pino - chet for his human rights abuses, Secretary of State Henry Kiss - inger issued a letter of reprimand; White threatened to resign; Kiss - inger withdrew it. NO GOING BACK When he arrived in El Salvador, White faced a constant stream of atrocities. \"Ten bullet-ridden bodies of people who have 'dis - appeared' are found daily on city streets or provincial high - ways, while the armed forces are increasingly attacking protest groups they describe as 'subver - sive,'\" the New York Times' Alan Riding wrote in March 1980. A 27-year-old leftist politician and his 23-year-old Danish wife were picked up the National Police; their tortured bodies were later found by the roadside 40 miles from the capital. When workers went on strike at an American- owned electronics plant, secu - rity forces stormed the building, took three workers to a separate room, and shot them in the head. Soldiers killed at least 300 civil - ians, many women and children, as they were trying to cross the Rio Sumpul into the safety of Honduras. \"There were so many vultures picking at the bodies in the water that it looked like a black carpet,\" a priest said. Not long after arriving in El Salvador, White sent Vance a \"Preliminary Assessment of the Situation.\" The 27-page cable is reminiscent of George Kennan's \"long telegram\" \u2014 which ana - lyzed the political landscape in the Soviet Union in 1946 and set the containment policy that was to guide the United States during the Cold War \u2014 and it deserves to be accorded the same place and importance in history. It was a highly classied \"No - Dis,\" meaning that it was not to be sent to anyone who was not on the short recipient list. It was not declassied and released un - til 1994. Even then, it has been largely overlooked; I wasn't aware of it until I interviewed White last year. I was struck at how ac - curate and prescient his analysis was \u2014 and, sadly, how it had been ignored in Washington. \"There is no stopping this rev - olution; no going back,\" White be - gan. In a sentence, he explained why. \"In El Salvador the rich and powerful have systematically de - frauded the poor and denied 80 percent of the people any voice in the aairs of their country.\" The government's security forces must \"stop torturing and killing any youth between 14 and 25 because he may be involved with labor unions, church orga - nizations, etc.,\" White wrote. He added, \"The daily total of dead, many among them teenagers bearing marks of brutal torture, result from right-wing terror - ism.\" At the same time, he was fully aware of the threat from the left. \"An extremist Communist take- over here, and by that I mean something just this side of the Pol Pot episode, is unfortunately a real possibility due to the intense hatred that has been created in this country among the masses by the insensitivity, blindness and brutality of the ruling elite.\" There was one thing White particularly wanted to be \"well understood in Washington.\" Yes, Cuba was providing training for some of the guerilla ghters and Russia was supplying some arms. But neither of these has \"created this threat of violent revolution but rather decades of oppression and a studied refusal on the part of the elite to make any conces - sions to the masses.\" White outlined the \"main players in this revolution.\" They ranged from the \"ultra-right,\" to the \"far-left guerrilla groups,\" as well as the army and included the Roman Catholic Church, which was led at the time by Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero. REAGAN Romero was the voice of the poor; his Sunday sermons were broadcast over radio, and peas - ants throughout Latin American tuned in. White warned Wash - ington in his cable that the arch - bishop might be the target of an \"incident of terrorism.\" Attend - ing his rst mass after present - ing his credentials as ambassador, White heard the archbishop read from a letter he had sent Presi - dent Carter calling for the cessa - tion of military aid. The archbish - op then turned to the Salvadoran military, and concluded the mass with a plea that rings through the ages. \"In the name of God, in the name of this suering people whose cries rise to heaven more loudly each day, I implore you, I beg you, I order you in the name of God: stop the repression.\" The next day, Romero was celebrating a small mass for the mother of the owner of an inde - pendent newspaper, which had been bombed two weeks earlier, when a shot rang out. The bullet entered the left side of the arch - bishop's chest, hit his heart and lodged in his lung.White attended the funeral. His presence was a political state - ment, as much as a religious ex - pression, applauded by the poor and peasants, condemned by the rich and military. The Salvadoran military and some in Washington sought to blame the assassination on the left, but it was the work of a 35 year old former military ocer, Roberto D'Aubuisson. Muscular, t and charismatic, D'Aubuisson was the founder of a political party, the right-wing National - ist Republican Alliance \u2014 and ran death squads, which target - ed students, union leaders and peasants. White, again not minc - ing his words, described him as a \"psychopathic killer,\" barred him from the embassy and instructed his sta not to meet with him. White worked tirelessly to achieve a political settlement. But he only had nine months \u2014 until Ronald Regan was elected in No - vember 1980. In sharp contrast to White, Reagan's rst ambassador to El Salvador, Deane Hinton, whose mission was to repair U.S. relations with the Salvadoran right, welcomed D'Aubuisson. Hinton developed an \"almost fa - ther-son relationship\" with him, one of Hinton's aides told me at the time. \"He thought he could channel him, push him along the democratic path, and theoretical -24/space.enPOLITI CO THURSDAY, APRIL 23, 2015 A By RAYMOND BONNERHISTORY DEPT.

In the process, he created a monster.\" (In February, Pope Francis declared Archbishop Romero a martyr, a step toward sainthood. D'Aubuisson died in 1992.) Reagan's election cheered those in El Salvador who had jeered White and President Carter for their human rights emphasis. \"All my neighbors were delirious with joy,\" White recalled, noting, of course, that the ambassador's residence was in an upscale neighborhood. \"There were reworks.\" IMPUNITY AND IMMUNITY White had hoped to wean the ci - vilians on the left from their mili - tary counterparts and bring them into negotiations with the gov - ernment. Reagan's election put paid to that eort. Three weeks after Reagan's victory, on No - vember 27th, Thanksgiving Day in Washington, heavily armed men stormed the archbishop's legal aid oce at San Jose High School, where the political lead - ers of the revolution were meet - ing. The head of the Democratic Revolutionary Front was Enrique Alvarez, a member of one of the country's wealthy coee-growing families, who saw the need for change in his country. Alvarez's mutilated, bullet-ridden corpse, as well as those of four other po - litical leftists, were found on a popular road, a clear message for others. When White learned of the murders, he slumped in his chair. \"Who I am going to talk to now?\" he said; he had lost the hope for a political settlement. In another act designed to send a message, White went to the legal aid oces \"to express my feeling of horror and repugnance for the unspeak - able crime committed here.\" Reflecting how dramatically the policy in El Salvador was about to shift, Reagan's princi - pal foreign policy advisor Jeanne Kirkpatrick reacted to murders thusly: \"I must say that I found myself thinking that it's a re - minder that people who live by the sword die by the sword.\" The Salvadoran military now believed it could kill with im - punity, and immunity. On De - cember 2, 1980, four American churchwomen\u2014Roman Catholic nuns Maura Clarke, Ita Ford and Dorothy Kazel, and a lay mission - ary, Jean Donovan\u2014were seized at the San Salvador International Airport, taken to a remote spot, raped, shot in the back of the head and buried in a shallow grave. Photojournalist Susan Meiselas captured an iconic image of an anguished White at the dusty gravesite as the partially clad bodies were being pulled from the earth with ropes. White knew im - mediately that the military was responsible. \"The bastards won't get away with this,\" he mumbled. But they almost did, with help from the Reagan Administration. THE FRONT LINE \"The nuns were not just nuns,\" Kirkpatrick said in response to this killing. \"They were political activists. We ought to be a little more clear about this than we ac - tually are,\" she told a reporter for the Tampa Tribune. \"They were political activists on behalf of the Frente [one of the leftist guerrilla organizations], and somebody who is using violence to oppose the Frente killed these nuns.\" Asked if she thought the govern - ment had been involved, she said, \"The answer is unequivocal. No, I don't think the government was responsible.\" Kirkpatrick later denied mak - ing the statement. The reporter produced the tape. Secretary of State Alexander Haig also sought to exonerate the military. \"Perhaps the vehi - cle the nuns were riding in may have tried to run a roadblock or may have accidentally been per - ceived to have been doing so, and there may have been an exchange of re,\" he said in congressional testimony. The Reagan Administration rejected White's analysis that this was a homegrown revolution. \"We believe that the government of El Salvador is on the front line in a battle that is really aimed at the very heart of the Western Hemisphere and eventually us,\" President Reagan said. El Salva - dor was to be a symbol of Ameri - can resolve, where the U.S. would show the Soviet Union it was still a power. In his trademark pithy lan - guage, White mocked the policy: \"Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guate - mala, all the way up to the soft underbelly of Kansas.\" El Salvador was soon receiv - ing $2 billion in foreign aid a year, most of it military, making it the third-largest recipient of Ameri - can largesse. Only the American embassies in Cairo and New Del - hi had more personnel. To carry out its policy, to keep the aid flowing, the Reagan Ad - ministration needed public sup - port. The continuing human rights violations, and particularly the killing of the churchwomen undermined that. Haig summoned White and told the ambassador he wanted POLITI CO THURSDAY, APRIL 23, 2015 /space.en25 him to send a cable saying the Sal - vadoran government was making progress in the investigation into the murders. White recalled what transpired. \"I said, 'Well, Mr. Sec - retary, that would not be possible because the Salvadoran military killed those women, and the idea that they're going to investigate in a serious way their own crimes is simply an illusion.'\" REMOVAL Haig kept up the pressure. \"Then I got a call from one of Haig's aides, saying that, 'the Secretary is anxiously awaiting,' my tele - gram that would arm that the Salvadoran military were con - ducting a serious investigation into who was responsible for the death of the nuns.\" White said he couldn't and wouldn't. The aide replied, \"All you're doing, Bob, is creating problems for all of us.\" He went on that White didn't have to say there was a \"serious\" investigation. \"You just have to say that something positive is happening.\" White stuck to his principles. \"I will have no part of any cover- up,\" he wrote in a cable back to Washington. \"All the evidence we have, and that has been reported fully, is that the Salvadoran gov - ernment has made no serious ef - fort to investigate the killing of the murdered American church - women.\" White knew there could not be a serious investigation be - cause two of the top Salvadoran military commanders, Gen. Jose Guillermo Garcia and Col. Carlos Vides Casanova were complicit in the cover-up. (Casanova was later promoted to general and succeed - ed Garcia as minister of defense.) That was the end for White. Conservatives had been gun - ning for White from the day of Reagan's election. The presi - dent-elect's State Department transition team labeled White, and some other ambassadors, as \"social reformers,\" and said he should be replaced immediately. After the transition team's paper became public \u2014 it was leaked to the New York Times \u2014 White called me, and Christopher Dickey of the Washington Post, to the embassy for a brieng. He was visibly angry and character - istically blunt. \"When civil war breaks out in this country, I hope they get their chance to serve,\" he said. On the record. EL MOZOTE Less than two weeks after being sworn in as secretary of state, Haig delivered the coup de grace, personally dismissing White from the foreign service. White was one of the \"distinguished vic - tims\" of Washington's ideological battles, in the class with George Kennan, said Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island. White went out with pride, \"I regard it as an honor to join a small group of ocers who have gone out of the service because they refused to betray their prin - ciples.\" The civil war White had feared raged for another decade. Thou - sands of Salvadorans were killed, most by the Salvadoran military and death squads, and more than a million were forced to flee the country, thousands risking their lives to cross the Rio Grande. Washington looked the other way, the Reagan Administration requesting, and Congress con - tinuing to send, military aid. In December 1981, a year to the month after the killing of the American churchwomen, a Salva - doran military battalion, which had been trained by the Ameri - can army, carried out one of the worst massacres in Latin Ameri - can history. With helicopter gun - ships circling overhead, soldiers killed more than 700 peasants in the villages around El Mozote. Escorted by guerrilla ghters, I arrived at the massacre site shortly after, with photojournal - ist Susan Meiselas; Alma Guill - ermoprieto of the Washington Post arrived a few days later. The victims included a 3-day old baby and a 70-year old grandmother; Runa Amaya's blind husband and three daughters (ages 3, 5 and 8 months) were killed; sol - diers raped Chona Diaz and her 12-year-old daughter; villagers were corralled into a church and executed. A few days after the massacre, President Reagan certied that the Salvadoran government \"is making a concerted and signi - cant eort to comply with inter - nationally recognized human rights,\" and that it \"is achieving substantial control over elements of its own armed forces, so as to bring an end to the indiscrimi - nate torture and murder of Sal - vadoran citizens.\" TRUTH TO POWER The violence continued. In No - vember of 1989, soldiers attacked the Central American Univer - sity and murdered six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her 15-year-old daughter. A bullet was red into a portrait of Arch - bishop Romero. It was \"the nal outburst of the delirium that had infected the armed forces and the innermost recesses of certain government circles,\" wrote the UN Commission on Truth for El Salvador. In 1992, the largest leftist revolutionary organization, the Farabundo Marti National Lib - eration Front (FMLN), and the government, which was headed by the conservative National - ist Republican Alliance (NRA), signed a peace agreement, which was supported by the Bush Ad - ministration. And since then, El Salvador has had several dem - ocratically-elected presidents, which is what White had sought to achieve. The current president is a former revolutionary leader, Salvador Sanchez Ceren. \"I know him,\" White told me. \"He's a for - mer high school teacher. And he's a very ne man.\" Robert White's legacy as a diplomat willing to speak truth to power, in a sense, was further secured when the Obama Admin - istration sought to deport Gen. Garcia and Gen. Casanova, who in the 1990s were allowed into the United States and were living well in Florida. White testied in each man's deportation hearing, linking them to torture, killings and other human rights abuses. The judges found that the men should be deported, and White's testimony gures heavily in their opinions, much as he gures hon - orably in the history of American diplomacy.

On the same day, Turks will commemo - rate the centennial of the World War I Gallipoli Campaign with an international delegation at a cer - emony on the Dardanelles. Both governments have accused each other of attempting to over - shadow the other's commemora - tions, while high-profile figures \u2014 from Pope Francis to human rights lawyer Amal Clooney \u2014 have re-engaged the long-running ques - tion of whether the 1915 massacres constituted a genocide, a claim Turkey has long denied. President Serzh Sargsyan of Armenia has insisted that the Turkish government's aim in holding ceremonies on the cho - sen date this year is \"to distract the world's attention from the 100th anniversary of the Arme - nian Genocide,\" a claim widely echoed by western reporters and analysts including Robert Fisk of Britain's Independent newspaper, who called it \"an unprecedented act of diplomatic folly\" earlier this year. In fact, Turkish commemora - tion of Gallipoli on April 24 is far from unprecedented. Last year on that date, for example, 50 foreign government ministers, includ - ing representatives of Britain, France and the Commonwealth countries, attended joint re - membrance services \u2014 which for the last 12 years have been held in Turkey a day before the ceremo - nies traditionally dominated by the Australian and New Zealand missions on April 25, the actual anniversary of the 1915 Allied landing in the Dardanelles. Since 2013, invitations to the \"International Day\" ceremonies on April 24 have extended to rep - resentatives of the 102 nationalities of the 500,000 soldiers killed at Gallipoli, and guests this year will include Princes Charles and Harry representing the United Kingdom. \"We have invited representa - tives from all the countries whose soldiers died at Gallipoli, includ - ing Armenia, to our ceremonies this year,\" said a spokesperson for the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \"The Armenian govern - ment is fully aware that the Galli - poli commemorations are always held on these two dates, but un - fortunately they choose to ignore it. This is a smear campaign.\" The Armenian Ministry of For - eign Affairs did not respond to PO - LITICO's requests for comment. A FAILED PEACE Armenian suspicion of Turkish intent may have been heightened this year by Turkey's inclusion of a high level \"Peace Summit\" \u2014 to be held in Istanbul on Thurs - day \u2014 as part of the week's com - memorative events. President Sargsyan was personally invited to attend the summit by Presi - dent Recep Tayyip Erdoan of Turkey but declined, as Erdoan had declined an invitation from Sargsyan to attend Armenian commemorations in Yerevan on the same date. In an open letter to Erdoan in January, Sargsyan claimed the massacres of Arme - nians by Ottoman Turks inspired the Holocaust: \"It was the impu - nity of that crime that prepared ground for the Holocaust and the genocides in Rwanda, Cambodia and Darfur.\" The term 'genocide' has been a subject of debate among politicians, historians and international lawyers for the last century. The Armenian govern - ment and its supporters say that 1.5 million Armenians were sys - tematically murdered by Otto - man officials during World War I, starting with the deportation of intellectuals from Constantino - ple on April 24, 1915 \u2014 constitut - ing a genocide. The Turkish gov - ernment argues that millions of people of all ethnicities, including Ottoman Muslims, were killed during the course of civil war, resulting in what Prime Minis - ter Ahmet Davutolu last year called \"a common pain inherited from our grandparents.\" Sensitivity to comparisons with the Nazi perpetrators of the Holocaust is often cited as being at the root of the Turkish gov - ernment's refusal to accept the \"genocide\" label on behalf of their Ottoman predecessors, along with worries about an accompa - nying expectation of reparations. Last April, Erdoan made inter - national headlines by expressing his \"regret\" for the sufferings of Armenians, along with other vic - tims of World War I. While hailed as an unprecedented concession on home ground, the statement was dismissed by Armenians as a \"non-apology.\" Although most scholarly and political debate focuses on the specific word genocide and its legal implications, Nazan Maksudyan, an associate profes - sor of history at Istanbul Kemer - burgaz University, thinks this is not necessarily the key for Turkey to take responsibility for the ac - tions of the Ottoman state. \"It is not about the word 'geno - cide,'\" she said. \"It is about acknowl - edging that this was an intended and organized crime against human - ity, committed by different actors at different levels, following the central orders of the state.\" Nonetheless, the word itself has come to be used as diplomatic code for support of the Armenian cause, especially by countries with significant Armenian populations, such as France. Switzerland and Greece not only recognize a geno - cide but have laws prohibiting its denial. Most recently, this led to a highly publicized case in which the chairman of the Turkish Workers' Party, Dou Perin\u00e7ek, fought a Swiss verdict at the Eu - ropean Court of Human Rights. In 2007, Perin\u00e7ek was found guilty of genocide denial and racial dis - crimination by a Swiss court, but this verdict was later overturned by the European Commission on Human Rights on the grounds that Perin\u00e7ek's right to freedom of speech had been infringed. Hu - man Rights Watch, among other organizations, opposes laws pro - hibiting genocide denial. In January this year, the gov - ernment of Armenia, represented by human rights lawyers Amal Clooney and Geoffrey Robertson QC, brought the Perin\u00e7ek case back to the ECHR. In her sum - ming up, Clooney argued that Turkey's defence of freedom of speech in the current case was hypocritical: \"This court knows very well how disgraceful Tur - key's record on free expression is.\" TREADING CAREFULLY In the last decade, several well-known writers have been pros - ecuted in Turkey for referring too prominently to the Armenian massacres, including Nobel Lau - reate Orhan Pamuk for remarks he made to a Swiss magazine in 2005, and author Elif afak for her novel \"The Bastard of Istan - bul\" in 2006. Both were charged with violating Article 301 of the penal code, which prohibits \"in - sulting Turkishness.\" And sen - sitivity to public comments per - ceived to be \"unpatriotic\" is high in Turkey. Earlier this month, a senior advisor to the prime min - ister, Armenian Etyen Mah\u00e7upy - an, stepped down after saying in an interview that the 1915 mas - sacres constituted a genocide. His remarks had been criticized by Volkan Bozkr, Turkey's min - ister for European affairs, as \"not appropriate.\" Some governments avoid passing judgment on what is privately called \"the g-word\" in diplomatic circles. Last year, the Foreign Relations Committee of the United States Senate ap - proved a resolution calling upon Turkey to acknowledge that the massacres of Armenians in 1915 constituted genocide. On April 15, the European Parliament passed a similar resolution, which was condemned in a joint statement by the three main Turkish politi - cal parties in an unusual show of solidarity. The UK has never of - ficially recognized an Armenian genocide, though last month the issue was debated, then tabled, in the House of Commons. Earlier this month, Pope Fran - cis referred to the massacres as \"the first genocide of the 20th century,\" which provoked Tur - key into recalling its ambassador to the Vatican. Volkan Bozkr de - nounced the Pope's native Argen - tina as \"a country that welcomed the leading executors of the Jew - ish Holocaust, Nazi torturers, with open arms.\" For his part, Erdoan warned the Pope \"not to repeat this mistake.\" Indeed, the centennial com - memorations have brought an unusual wave of highly publicized commentary and attention. Per - haps the most striking example of this phenomenon is Kim Kar - dashian, the third generation American-Armenian reality TV star, who arrived in Armenia for the first time this month and met with Prime Minister Hovik Abra - hamyan. Though Kardashian said her intention was merely \"to see my heritage,\" the visit was widely regarded as a political statement \u2014 one that highlighted the growing role of celebrities in exerting inter - national pressure in a debate that has endured for a hundred years.

EPAO By ALEV SCOTT from Istanbul \"This is a smear campaign.\" Spokesperson of the when this was hap - pening three or four years ago,\" said Larry Summers, the former U.S.Treasury Secretary. \"But the world vastly underestimated the impact of the Russian default, the subprime crisis and the risk of letting Lehman go. This is like pulling the thread of a sweater. It could tear o with no conse - quence. Or it could unravel en - tirely and set o something very big.\" The fear that a Greek default and exit from the eurozone could spark a market panic that might destroy the currency union it - self and ripple around the world is also held at the highest levels of the Obama administration. Administration ocials mostly share the view of European Commission President Jean- Claude Juncker who told POLIT - ICO this week that a Greek exit could \"lead us to consequences that people don't know the am - plitude about.\" Administration ocials are publicly and privately pressing Greece and its European credi - tors to come up with some kind of deal by the end of the week, though that deadline now ap - pears to be slipping. Such a deal would release 7.1 billion euro to allow Greece to continue to pay its bills, at least until the next reckoning over the nation's $273 billion 257 billion euro bailout hits this summer. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew last week warned that if Greece were to leave the eurozone it would cause severe economic hardship for the nation's 11 mil - lion citizens and could destabi - lize markets. \"I have said consistently that no one should think that all of the risk of a change like that is predictable in advance,\" Lew told Bloomberg Television. \"And even if the contagion risk is much less now than it was in 2012 and earlier, it would not be a good thing in a world economy just recovering from a deep recession to have that kind of uncertainty introduced.\" The U.S. has no direct role in talks between Greek ocials, led by nance minister Yanis Varou - fakis, and creditors from the Eu - ropeanStability Mechanism, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. But Treasury ocials continue to press all sides to come to terms before a nance ministers meet - ing in Riga, Latvia on Friday. Reports Wednesday suggest - ed no deal is likely emerge be - fore the Friday meeting and that Greece could stumble along until June without defaulting. But if no agreement is reached by then, European lenders could refuse to release any more bail - out money to Greece, which could in turn quickly run out of cash to pay its bills. Greece this week ordered local governments to start keeping cash with the nation's central bank, a move reminiscent of the Argentinian collapse in 2002. If Greece can't unlock new bailout funds it could lead the nation to default on its loans and set the stage for a Greek exit \u2014 or \"Grexit\"\u2014 the widely used port - manteau for the country leaving the currency union. ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE A senior Treasury ocial told POLITICO that he expected a deal would be ultimately be reached. He said that the alter - native could conceivably set the stage for other nations to leave the common currency. This could then lead to the collapse of the currency itself, deep reces - sion across Europe and days - if not weeks - of volatile market reaction that could damage in - vestor and business condence enough to derail a U.S. economy that is only growing around 2 percent at best right now. None of these frightening outcomes are at all certain, the Treasury ocial said. And it re - mains quite possible that Greece could leave the euro with rela - tively little impact. But the un - certainty remains so high that a deal must be reached, said the of - cial, who declined to be quoted directly or identied by name in order to speak freely about high - ly sensitive talks. Another senior Washington policy maker said the risk as - sociated with a Greek exit alone was not especially high. But this person added that market events rarely happen in a vacuum and that a Greek exit coupled with a foreign policy problem or a mis - take by the U.S.Federal Reserve in interest rate policy could tilt markets and the global economy back toward recession or worse. \"No one thing creates pure panic but you could easily have two or three viable candidates that could move in parallel with each other\u2014 geopolitical or mon - etary \u2014 that could create a very powerful eect,\" said this policy maker, who also requested ano - nymity to speak freely on a sen - sitive topic. Investors got a taste of just how risky a Greek default and possible euro exit could be last Friday when reports that a deal might not be reached helped spark a global sell-o that at one point saw the Dow Jones Indus - trial Average down over 300 points. Interest rates on Greek debt also rose to two-year highs. Rates on other European debt, including Portugal and Italy, also initially rose before ECB buying kicked in, suggest - ing that if Greece falls, investors could then start to punish other nations viewed as vulnerable to default. Spiking rates could turn once manageable debt loads into crushing burdens. Fears over this kind of vicious cycle leave many big Wall Street money managers and executives skeptical of the argument that the world is now prepared for a Greek exit and that such an out - come might actually be prefer - able to going through these near misses over and over. These money managers say if Greece does wind up leaving the euro zone it will probably not be a \"Grexit\" at all. That phrase, they say,connotes an orderly process in which the country's euros are carefully replaced with drachma and nobody panics and pulls all their money out of the bank. Instead, many Wall Street executives say it's more likely that a Greek departure would be an accident - now known on Wall Street as a\"Graccident\" - in which the county is forced out of the eurozone by banks runs and a collapse in investor condence. \"If a Graccident were to oc - cur it would be very messy,\" said Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief eco - nomic adviser at global money - management rm Allianz. \"And the global economy is still too fragile to take a major shock. The good news is that Europe has done alot to increase its de - fenses against contagion. But it could still be very dangerous to stumble into an accident.\" CONTAGION RISK In a recent note to clients, UBS analyst Paul Donovan warned of investor complacency over the possibility of a Greek exit. \"In - vestors seem to have embraced the belief that if Greece were to walk away from the euro, it would walk alone with minimum con - tagion toother countries. This belief is dangerous,\" he wrote. \"The contagion risk after a pos - sible Greek exit arises if bank depositors elsewhere inthe euro area believe that a physical euro note held 'under the mattress' at home today is worth more than a euro in a bank \u2014 because a euro in a bank might be forcibly con - verted into a national currency tomorrow.\" Not all Wall Street analysts or executives share this view. In fact, some argue that the time has come to recognize that Greece, particularly under its leftist Syriza government led by PrimeMinister Alexis Tsipras, is never going to enact serious scal reforms no matter what it says publicly and will eventually default on its debt.The case for not caring much about a Grexit holds that most of the nation's debt is now held by other countries rather than banks,making nancial system failures less likely. Meanwhile, European economic growth is picking up and should be able to withstand aperiod of turbulence, this line of thinking holds. And Greece is a tiny economy whose collapse would cause localized pain but register barely a blip around the globe. Some top executives on Wall Street argue that it would be much worse for creditors to cave in to demands for more lenient terms fromGreek's anti-austeri - ty political leaders. Because that would mean other debtor na - tions would also soon clamor for relief. Better to rip the bandage o and put an end to the charade that Greece will ever pay back all its loans. \"In 2012, if Greece blew up, it would have posed serious sys - temic risk,\" said one Wall Street chief executive who declined to be identied by name in or - der to speak freely. \"But now the private sector has nowhere near what anyone would dream of calling systemic exposure. In fact, any capitulation by credi - tors of any signicant magnitude would be the real source of sys - temic risk.\" This executive added that a Greek exit could actually boost global markets because \"you kick Greece out and the world re - alizes this is not a systemic prob - lem and the euro rallies because they just got rid of the weakest link.\" But the more widely held view \u2014 in Washington and on Wall Street \u2014 is that while Europe has indeed built more rewalls and reduced private sector exposure to Greek debt, the unknown re - action to a Grexit is potentially much worse that the annoyingly familiar and increasingly tire - some rounds of angst-ridden talks between Greece and its creditors. \"If Greece leaves it will never be possible to say again that exit is impossible and if exit is always possible then you put increasing pressure on the weaker coun - tries,\" said Summers. \"Of course, it's also not tenable for the euro area to rmly establish that exit is impossible or no country will feel any disciplinary pressure. So the matter is quite delicate and we all have to hope and push for a mutually satisfactory con - clusion.\"28/space.enPOLITI CO THURSDAY, APRIL 23, 2015 Fears that Greece may cause disaster GREECE FROM PAGE 1 Eurogroup unlikely to strike Greek deal this week Greece and its creditors are un - likely to strike a deal during Fri - day's Eurogroup meeting in Riga because the Greek government still has enough resources to continue playing for time. \"We think an interim agree - ment that unlocks short term funding for Athens will come closer to the 11 May Europ - group,\" writes Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group, an analysis rm. Rahman puts the odds of an eventual deal with the Interna - tional Monetary Fund, Euro - pean Commission and European Central Bank that stops Greece from being ejected from the euro at 70 percent, although that doesn't preclude an extreme cri - sis and maybe even capital con - trols to save its banking system from collapse. The view that Greece will eventually climb down is widely shared. \"The Greek government needs to show that it ghts until the very end,\" writes Lars Chris - tensen of Danske Bank. \"We have been in this situation before with Greece normally blinking eventually.\" And that end is close, but not yet here. By all accounts the Greek gov - ernment is hunting for the last scraps of cash to continue pay - ing salaries and pensions while starting to repay some of its debts. To the fury of local gov -ernments, Prime Minister Alex - is Tsipras this week mandated they hand over any spare money to the central bank. That could give Athens enough wiggle room to make an initial payment on its debt to the IMF, allowing it to push o a - nal reckoning. Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek nance minister, already admit - ted this week that there won't be a resolution at Friday's Eu - rogroup meeting. But he added, \"The convergence is clear.\" That moderate optimism was echoed by Beno\u00eet Cur\u00e9, a mem - ber of the ECB's executive board, who said, \"In recent days, there has been tangible progress in the quality of the discussions.\" But the road to a nal agree -ment is still likely to provide some hair-raising thrills. \"We'll start giving money only after the Greeks will start imple - menting reforms,\" said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch nance minister and Eurogroup head. The problem is that Tsipras is both trying to keep Greece in the eurozone (one of his electoral pledges) while avoiding contin - ued austerity measures that his voters hate but which Greece's creditors are demanding as the price for further nancial aid. The coalition government led by Tsipras's populist Syriza Party has seen its popularity fall from around 80 per cent at the beginning of this year to only 60 percent now. But polls also show overwhelming Greek support for staying in the eurozone. \"This government does not have a mandate to do a deal on the reforms that the lenders want and it does not have a man - date to get out of the eurozone,\" said Dimittris Drakopoulos, an economist with Nomura, the in - vestment bank. The outline of a deal \u2014 per - haps struck in May or even June, when Greece really will be out of cash and options \u2014 in all likeli - hood means a renewed commit - ment on the part of the Greek government to tough reforms tied to another bailout package. Tsipras \"needs to string the negotiations out as long as possi - ble in an attempt to demonstrate he got the best possible deal from Germany,\" says Rahman.By ZEKE TURNER Yanis Varoufakis GETTY IMAGESIT'S NOT ABOUT SIZE.

By their thinking, any move by NATO to take in new mem - bers inflames tensions with Rus - sia, which opposes enlargement and considers the alliance an adversary. Italy and the Netherlands are skeptical as well. The Obama administration hasn't tipped its hand. Ocials at NATO say the de - bate won't intensify until the second half of the year. A nal decision will be taken at the 2016 NATO summit in Warsaw. But positions are hardening. After returning from talks in Minsk on the last ceasere deal, French President Fran\u00e7ois Hol - lande met NATO Secretary Gen - eral Jens Stoltenberg in Paris. Brieng the press afterward, President Hollande surprised the visiting NATO leader by stat - ing that, \"France's position for the moment is to refuse any new membership.\" A senior NATO and an EU of - cial say the French leader had oered the same reassurance to President Putin during the Minsk talks. \"Hollande revealed a quiet side deal from Minsk - no more enlargement,\" said the NATO ocial, likening it to a \"secret protocol\" of that cease - re deal. A spokesman for Presi - dent Hollande declined to com - ment on this allegation. A senior French ocial in Brussels said Hollande was pri - marily motivated to avoid doing anything that might jeopardize the Minsk agreement. Along with other European countries, France opposes any steps by NATO to move ahead with ac - cession for Ukraine and Georgia - the two former Soviet states that Russia considers within its sphere of influence. The ocial said France is skeptical of Mon - tenegro's suitability for mem - bership, but willing to keep an open mind. On the other side, Turkey, Croatia and Bulgaria are mak - ing the push for Montenegro, according to diplomats at the alliance's headquarters near the Brussels airport. \"They want to show NATO isn't afraid to enlargement and will lock the Balkans into the Euro-Atlantic strategy and won't leave them in limbo,\" said a senior NATO ocial, who asked to remain anonymous. Some of former members of the Warsaw Pact who aren't in the Balkans want to make sure that Rus - sia can't claim a veto right over NATO's decisions. \"There have been dierent opinions and there still are dif - ferent opinions, and for me that is not an expression of weak - ness,\" Stoltenberg told POLITI - CO in an interview. Asked about enlargement coming up at the Minsk talks, he added that, \"I guess [enlargement] is discussed in many dierent fora but that's up to NATO to decide together with the applicant country, and no one else.\" Stoltenberg endorsed the \"open door\" policy - in principle. \"It is a fundamental right of every sovereign nation to decide its own path including what kind of security arrangements it want to be part of,\" Stoltenberg said in the interview earlier this month. \"Whether NATO shall continue to enlarge is the question which should only be decided by the applicant countries and the 28 allies.\" Stoltenberg, a former Norwe - gian prime minister who took over at NATO last October, has to walk a tricky line between the conflicting views of the member states. After Moscow's annexa - tion of Ukraine's Crimea last year, his predecessor Anders Fogh Rasmussen was one of the most prominent European hawks on Russia, calling for a rmer response. His rhetoric made Berlin and other European capitals uncomfortable. Stolten - berg was the preferred choice of German Chance Angela Merkel, who wanted a less outspoken secretary general, according to ocials in Berlin and Washing - ton. Dierences over who to bring in have flared every time it has come up at NATO since the end of the Cold War. Jacques Chi - rac, the former French presi - dent, wanted to include Roma - nia in the rst wave of eastern enlargement in 1997. He was overruled. Skepticism about the Baltic states ran deep but the U.S. helped push them through in 2004. And in 2008, Germa - ny's Angela Merkel blocked an initiative by the Bush Admin - istration to oer Ukraine and Georgia a \"Membership Action Plan,\" a formal rst step toward membership. Russia has since invaded both countries, which are no longer part of the serious enlargement conversation. Although Russia's focus is on its immediate neighborhood, Putin has tried to strengthen ties with the Orthodox Christian Balkan states. He visited Bel - grade last year, attending a mili - tary parade, and reached out to Greece. There's concern inside the alliance that Russia's mov - ing to undermine NATO's south - eastern flank. Yet the Ukraine conflict has also softened the views on en - largement of some Eastern Eu - ropean members, previously the loudest proponents of a larger alliance. The Polish government is on the fence with Montenegro, fear - ing that the alliance's Article Five commitment to mutual de - fense will be diluted by a move into the Balkans. They also see little enthusiasm in Washington, and would prefer for NATO to fo - cus on strengthening collective defense. The camp is divided as well. \"You need enlargement more than ever,\" said a diplomat at NATO from another Eastern Eu -ropean country. \"It stabilizes the entire region.\" With his measured support for an \"open door,\" Stoltenberg of - fered assurances to those further in the gray zone between Russia and the West. NATO, he said, was \"moving Georgia forward on the path towards membership.\" He added that, \"we will assess a pos - sible application from Ukraine in exactly the same way as we assess any other application.\" These two are a non-starter for most NATO countries, leaving Montenegro as the most conten - tious issue. \"It's a general politi - cal context that's not within our power to control,\" said Dragana Radulovi, Montenegro's ambas - sador to NATO. \"What is in our power to control,\" she added, is to implement the reforms re - quired for membership. In the alliance, there are concerns about the low pub - lic support in the country for membership and the inltration by Russia of its intelligence ser - vices. \"The French no is a soft no,\" said a NATO diplomat who fa - vors an invitation to other coun - tries. \"If Germany and the U.S. come out in favor, others will fall in line.\"NATO FROM PAGE 1 bedfellows. Both declined to be interviewed, but people who know them describe a bit of an odd couple. Madero is good- natured and academic in appear - ance. By contrast, Banasevic, is forthright and imposing, not least because of his towering physique. Yet, both are said to share the same \"steely\" determi - nation and tenacity. Madero, a Real Madrid fan, joined the Commission's anti - trust department in 1987. The success of the Microsoft case, which he began investigating in 1999, catapulted him up the ranks of the Commission. As a result, he has now spent every year since 1999 \u2014 except one either directly working on or overseeing antitrust cases in the technology sector - making him one of the most influential tech regulators in Europe over the last two decades. He is described as an \"inspir - ing\" leader with deep-seated principals of public service and a \"prosecutorial\" approach to cases. The Microsoft case was also decisive for Banasevic, who went on to become the unit's deputy head. Banasevic, described alter - natively as tenacious or abrasive, has subsequently accumulated a horde of trophy cases: the Com - mission's probe of Intel, which cumulated in a ne of \u20ac1 billion for the chipmaker, the merger review that eventually blocked NYSE Euronext's $9 billion bid for Deutsche B\u00f6rse, as well as settlement deals with Rambus, Samsung and Motorola. An economist by training, he graduated from the College of Europe, an elite postgraduate in - stitution specializing in Europe - an aairs, in 1995. That year has no shortage of big stars: Alex - ander Stubb, who was Finland's prime minister for almost year until losing the general elections on Sunday. Valerie Plame, the American spy whose identity was revealed in 2003 by a member of the sta of the US vice-president, Dick Cheney, also graduated in that year. The connective tissue for both men, as they approach the Google case, is their Microsoft experience, which is critical, given the strategy thus far out - lined by Vestager. By deciding to formally charge Google, Vestag - er has reverted to a model that led to such high nes in the Mi - crosoft battle. Her predecessor, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, had sought to strike a global settlement with Google that would resolve a se - ries of complaints and concerns relating to its search engine, its ad-serving business and its use of content on rival websites. Almunia wanted to avoid re- enacting the protracted battle between Microsoft and the Commission that had dominated much of the rst decade of the century. In a polished perfor - mance, Vestager reversed that approach last week when she formally accused Google of using its search engine to favor its own shopping comparison business to detriment of rivals.\"Given the small size of the team, the complexity of the case and the material absence of ex - ternal support, it was probably the right thing to do to focus on a narrow area,\" said Jacques Latte, a consultant with Avisa who represents 1plusV, a com - plainant in the case. By one logic, pursuing a suc - cessful narrow test case would make subsequent cases much easier. With several complaints and concerns up her sleeve, that gives Vestager plenty of leverage over Google. Yet, there are concerns among complainants that the protract - ed settlement talks under Almu - nia left Vestager with few other options. The Commission's charges are based largely on the rst com - plaint lodged with the Commis - sion by a price comparison web - site called Foundem in 2009. Has the Commission fully investi - gated all subsequent complaints, some close to the case wonder? That may be a tall order given that a small team of only four or ve ocials is running the Google search engine case, deal - ing on a day-to-day basis deals with the lawyers and lobbyists recruited by Google, twenty-odd complainants and a host of so- called \"interested parties\". They can and do call on the expertise of the Commission's economists and legal service. Realizing that its resources would be stretched by a case of this magnitude, the Commission in 2012 launched a tender for \"consultancy services on techni - cal, economic and legal matters in the context of ICT and media competition cases\" with an esti - mated value of \u20ac6 million. Four law rms \u2014 Field Fisher Waterhouse, Hogan Lovells, Sid - ley Austin and Webb Henderson \u2014 were selected to sit on a panel. But there are doubts as to wheth - er it has ever been used. Any decision not to call on those external advisers would raise serious questions given that the Commission is into its sixth year of investigating Google with no result to-date.Madero, Banasevic will draw on deep experience GOOGLE FROM PAGE 1Nicholas Vinocur in Paris contributed to this article.Jens Stoltenberg GETTY IMAGESPOLITI CO THURSDAY, APRIL 23, 2015 /space.en31 for years \u2014 could stand to lose their job security, career pros - pects, and perhaps even their right to live outside their home country. While the \"golden generation\" of British nationals who entered the EU in the 1970s \u2014 when hopes for a common Europe ran high \u2014 are now approaching retirement after successful careers in the institutions, their successors \u2014 mid-career ocials who have invested the past ten to 20 years in the EU \u2014 are facing an existential crisis. \"It's a strange place to be in when your home country is go - ing through this deep paroxysm of doubt about its relationship with Europe, when you've made the decision that this is what you want to be doing with your life,\" said one high-ranking Commis - sion ocial from the UK. \"That makes you feel a little bit home - less, in a way.\" Martin Bailey, 43, a Brit - ish national who has worked for the Commission for almost ten years, echoed that thought. \"You've invested your career in the institutions, and now the rug will be pulled from under your feet,\" he said. \"It must be a bit dark. At my age, I think that if we pulled out, I would need to reinvent myself.\" Bailey looked into taking Belgian citizenship several months ago, but has not pursued the option. He is the chair of Pro Europa, a Brussels- based organization of British expats that advocates for Brit - ish EU membership. \"People are considering what they'll do next. You must have a second string to your boat.\" STAFFING SLOWDOWN Brexit may be a distant political possibility, but British expats here, especially those with chil - dren who've grown up outside the UK, are increasingly worry - ing about the practical implica - tions of what it might mean for them. Already, the prospect has cast a chill over the hiring of new British ocials, who now number 1,187, representing less than 4 percent of commission ocials. In 2000, the number of Brits in the Commission peaked at around 1,500. (The Commis - sion does not track the number of dual citizens in its ranks). \"Normally, there's no point having two nationalities, be - cause with an EU passport, it's an EU passport,\" said one long - time British ocial at the Com - mission who applied for Dutch citizenship last year, as the issue rose to the fore in British poli - tics. Her husband is Dutch, and they have a two-year old son. She asked not to be identied, citing professional concerns. At a certain point, this ocial said, \"it started to look interest - ing to have a dierent EU pass - port,\" adding, \"There's no clarity inside the institutions. We all as - sume that we wouldn't be kicked out, because we're employed. But everyone basically thinks that your career goes down the drain,\" if your home country is not a member, she said. \"It was an insurance policy, really.\" She has no plans to move back to the UK, where the cost of living is prohibitive for many people earning mid-level Commission salaries here. British ocials will have to wait for the outcome of a refer - endum to have a better idea of what a Brexit might mean for them. Until then, there will be little information on what will happen to this cohort of British Eurocrats should the UK decide to leave the EU. The one thing that's certain is that whatever ultimately happens would take a long time to take full eect, but the hiring chill could rapidly escalate to an outright freeze on new hires and promotions. Brits who stick around could become Berlaymont legends -- like the four Norwegian holdouts who still work in the commission long after their country elected not to join in 1994. \"In a worst case scenario, I'm going to have marry my part - ner of the last 20 years, because she's got an Irish passport,\" said David Earnshaw, CEO of Burson-Marsteller's Brussels of - ce, and one-time Labour Party candidate for the European Parliament. \"In a slightly less worst-case-scenario, I have to become Belgian, which I actually wouldn't mind doing. I'd quite like to be Belgian.\" Both the Saint-Gilles and Tervuren communes reported receiving petitions for Belgian nationality from British citizens in 2014. PRACTICAL CONCERNS Dennis Abbott, who left the Commission for Burson- Marsteller in February, after ten years of working as a spokesper - son, began the process of apply - ing for Belgian citizenship three months ago. A UK citizen (and former editor of European Voice), Abbott has two teenage daughters, ages 16 and 17, who grew up in Brussels and who will soon be heading to university. \"There are lots of things that worry me about if the Brexit ac - tually happened, which are very, very practical things,\" Abbott said. \"\"Not so much for myself but more for my teenage daugh - ters. Everyone talks about the big things, like trade, and there are all these numbers being thrown around, which no normal person can get their head around. But if I look at the situation as an in - dividual with children that age, I sort of thought, well what will happen, for example, if they go to university in another European country?\" If, after a Brexit, his daughters elect to go to a European univer - sity outside the UK, Abbott is concerned that they may have to pay a much higher sum for their educations, or may not qualify to participate in the Erasmus study abroad program, which al - lows students in EU countries to study in any other member na - tion. \"There is no guarantee that people who are UK citizens will still be able to take advantage of the Erasmus scheme. Maybe they'll come up with a way where the UK manages to pay for its students to be part of it, but my kids might get caught up in that period of uncertainty. These things take time to talk about,\" Abbott said. BUSINESS AS USUAL Talk of taking second passports may have started to swirl around Schuman circle, but hasn't yet interrupted the order of busi - ness in Berlaymont, several of - cials said. \"There have been moments throughout my 25 years here when it feels uncomfortable for me or my interlocutors that I hold a UK passport \u2014 but in an international government, those problems arise,\" said Rob - ert Madelin, director general for Communications Networks, Content and Technology. \"We foresee demographic crunches coming for Swedish, Danish, maybe German and French passports,\" he said. \"It's not like British ocials fear li ing under annexation, where you have to leave if you don't take the right passport.\" While having dual national - ity may insulate the British ex - pats from the impact of a Brexit, that isn't the only reason some are pursuing second passports. There's also the fact that after living outside the UK for more than 15 years, UK citizens are no longer eligible to cast their vote in national elections. A sec - ond EU nationality would allow them to exercise their vote else - where. \"If there is a British soul, it is pragmatic,\" says Madelin. And it is practical matters that are driv - ing Brits to explore other citizen - ship options, and to make the case against a Brexit. They know that the welfare of the relatively small number of UK nationals serving in the EU \u2014 and of their children \u2014 will probably not be the highest priority for their gov - ernment's agenda if withdrawal comes to pass. \"Once you make the argu - ments personal, about how safe will your job be, how safe will your mortgage be \u2014 ques - tions which aect everybody,\" said Abbott, \"then the case is perhaps more persuasive than when you're talking about trans- Atlantic trade agreements.\"Brits hedge bets, seek new passports BREXIT FROM PAGE 1 BEN JENNINGS20,000 Employees in Europe.
