**Flysheet issued; ***Job family standard issued U.S. Office of Personnel Management 3 INTRODUCTION The Handbook of Occupational Groups and Families provides agencies with a starting point to classify positions . For additional information, please refer to the Introduction to the Position Classification Standards . The Handbook of Occupational Groups and F amilies is divided into two parts: PART I White Collar Occupational Series Defines occupations and lists the series names and codes used in classifying white collar jobs in the Federal Government. Previous editions of this document referred to these occupations as \"General Schedule System Occupations.\" PART II Trade, Craft, or Labor Occupational Series Defines occupations and lists the occupation names and codes used in classifying trade, craft or labor jobs in the Federal Government . Previous editions of this document referred to these occupations as \"Federal Wage System Occupations.\" GLOSSARY TERM DEFINITION Classification Standard Classification standards are i ssued by OPM to relate the grade level definitions in title 5 to specific work situations and thereby provide the basis for assigning to each position the appropriate title, series, and grade. (Source: Introduction to the Position Classification Standards , TS-134, July 1995, Revised 2009) Federal Wa ge System 5 U.S.C. 5102 (c)(7) exempts from coverage under the General Schedule those \"employees in recognized trades or crafts, or other skilled mechanical crafts, or in unskilled, semi-skilled, or skilled manual-labor occupations, and other employees inc luding foremen and supervisors in positions having trade, craft, or laboring experience and knowledge as the paramount requirement.\" Such positions are covered by the Federal Wage System. Flysheet Flysheets provide some information about a series and may suggest standards and guides to use for determining grade levels under the General Schedule or Federal Wage System, but include no grade level criteria. Functional Guide and Standards Functional guides and functional standards are used to determine the grade of broad categories of Federal work classified under the General Schedule (GS) Classification System and the Federal Wage System (FWS) , respectively . Handbook of Occupational Groups 2018 *Classification standard issued; **Flysheet issued; ***Job family standard issued U.S. Office of Personnel Management 4 General Schedule The classification system covered by chapter 51 of title 5. It includes a range of levels of difficulty and responsibility for covered positions from grades GS1 to GS15. It is designated by \"GS\" for positions at all of these grade levels. (Source: Introduction to the Position Classification Standards , TS-134, July 1995, Revised 2009) Job Family ( for Trade, Craft and Labor) A job family is a broad grouping of trades, craft, and labor occupations related in one or more ways such as: similarity of functions performed, transferability of knowledge and skills from one occupation to another, or similarity of materials or equipment worked on. (Source: Federal Wage System Job Grading System , TS-44, Sep 1981) Job Family Standard ( for White Collar) A Job Family Standard (JFS) covers a group of related white collar occupations or series. (Source: The Classifier's Handbook , TS-107, Aug 1991) Occupational Group A major category of white collar occupations, embracing a group of associated or related occupations; e.g., the Accounting and Budget Group, GS 0500; the Engineering and Architecture Group, GS 0800; the General Administrative, Clerical, and Office Services Group, GS0300). (Source: Introduction to the Position Classification Standards , TS-134, July 1995, Revised 2009) Series A subdivision of an occupational group or job family consisting of positions similar as to specialized line of work and qualifi cation requirements. Series are designated by a title a nd number such as the Accounting Series, 0510; the Secretary Series, 0318; the Microbiology Series, 0403. (Source: Introduction to the Position Classification Standards , TS-134, July 1995, Revised 2009) Trade, Cra ft, and Labor Occupations If a position clearly requires trades, craft, or laboring experience and knowledge as a requirement for the performance of its primary duty, and this requirement is paramount, the position is in a trade, craft, or labor occupation regardless of its organizational location or the nature of the activity in which it exists. (Source: Introduction to the Position Classification Standards , TS-134, July 1995, Revised 2009) White Collar Occupations A position is considered white collar , even if it requires physical work, if its primary duty requires knowledge or experience of an administrative, clerical, scientific, artistic, or technical nature not related to trade, craft, or manual -labor work. (Source: Introduction to the Position Classification Standards , TS- 134, July 1995, Revised 2009) Handbook of Occupational Groups and Families December 2018 *Classification standard issued; **Flysheet issued; ***Job family standard issued U.S. Office of Personnel Management 5 General Information This handbook does not provide grading criteria. For positions classified under the General Schedule, position c lassification s tandards and job family standards provide grading criteria. Job grading standards provide grading criteria for tr ade, craft, and labor positions classified under the Federal Wage System. A single asterisk (*) in this handbook indicates a published position classification standard or job grading standard exists for that series. Two asterisks (**) indicate a flysheet exists for that series. Thre e asterisks (***) indicate a published job family position classification standard exists for that series. For additional information regarding the classification of positions as Professional, Administrative, Techn ical, Clerical, or Other (PATCO), please refer to the Introduction to the Position Classification Standards , TS-134, July 1995, Revised 2009).
