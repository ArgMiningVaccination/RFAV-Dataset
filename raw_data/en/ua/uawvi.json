In preparation for this, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) and the District of Columbia Public Charter School Board (DC PCSB) asked LEAs to develop Continuous Education and School Recovery Plans for the 2020-21 school year. OSSE required all LEAs in the District of Columbia that serve students in grades K-12 to submit continuous education plans in order to waive the requirement that a school year include a minimum of 180 instructional days at 6 hours per day as prescribed in 5-A DCMR \u00a72100.3. DC PCSB required all public charter school LEAs to submit continuous education plans to capture school academic and operational changes during the 2020-21 school year in response to COVID-19. These plans must meet certain baseline requirements\u2014namely, completion, clarity, alignment with applicable laws and policies delineated throughout this application, and for public charter schools, alignment with their approved charters. In addition, all plans must align with public health guidelines. The plan below has been approved for these purposes. This plan is intended to provide the public with information on how the LEA has prepared for the 2020-21 school year in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. LEAs have the flexibility to design continuous education and school recovery plans to best fit their individual or specific needs. LEAs may periodically update plans based on the evolving nature of the District's response to the pandemic. Additional questions pertaining to the implementation of these plans should be directed to the school and LEA. 1Term used to describe situations in which students access instruction from a location outside of the physical school building, whether delivered synchronously or asynchronously; distance learning is synonymous with remote learning. 2These policies are intended to capture school academic and operational changes during the 2020-21 school year in response to COVID-19. If a charter LEA intends to make any major academic or operational shifts for future school years (2021-22 or beyond), please reach out to DC PCSB staff to discuss memorializing those changes in a charter amendment. 3Refer to health guidance for child care and schools, available here: https://coronavirus.dc.gov/healthguidance . Note that this guidance is subject to change due to the need to respond effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic. LEAs are responsible for incorporating additional public health guidance into their policies as such guidance is released. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 1 Application Questions School Recovery Operations Plan Regular Cleaning Schedule The school will regularly clean, disinfect, and sanitize surfaces, toys, and materials per the District's and CDC guidance. The school will adhere to the following: Routinely clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched. This includes cleaning objects/surfaces not ordinarily cleaned daily (e.g., handrails, doorknobs, light switches, classroom sink handles, countertops, storage doors, water taps). For all cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting products, Eagle will follow the manufacturer's instructions for concentration, application method, contact time, and drying time before use of the object or area, by a child. Develop and implement a schedule for increased, routine cleaning, disinfection and sanitization. Avoid use of shared objects and spaces (gym, physical education equipment, art supplies, toys, games, classroom tools, manipulatives). Toys, including those used indoors and outdoors, will be frequently cleaned and sanitized throughout the day. Machine washable toys will be used by only one child and laundered as often as possible. Mats, cots and bedding will be individually labeled and stored. Mats and cots will be placed at least six feet apart or maximum distance possible, while in use and cleaned and sanitized between uses. Bedding will be laundered at least weekly and be used by only one child. Mats and cots will be cleaned, sanitized appropriately before stacking after each use. Playground structures will be included as part of daily routine cleaning, especially high-touch surfaces (e.g., handlebars). Shared bathrooms will be assigned to specific groups of students and staff. Each group of students will have a specific time during the daily schedule to use their assigned bathroom. Bathrooms will be cleaned and disinfected after each group has finished. The school will implement safe and correct storage for cleaning and disinfection products based on guidelines presented by the product vendor. Cleaning products will not be used near students or by students. Staff will implement measures when using 1.Describe the LEA's plan to keep buildings clean, including: What is the cleaning schedule? For example, what happens weekly, daily, and multiple times per day?; and How you will ensure buildings are clean if/when an individual in a school community tests positive for COVID-19 (e.g., work with an outside vendor specializing in deep cleaning or train in-house janitorial staff to ensure cleaning standards are met)?

Custodians are responsible to clean, disinfect and sanitize high touch areas in classrooms and common areas multiple times per day and as needed. Teachers and Aides will wipe down and sanitize the student desks in their own classrooms two times per day and more as needed. Security is responsible to sanitize (wipe or spray with disinfectant) high touch areas in common areas multiple times per day and as needed. Nightly 8:00pm-12:00am Contracted cleaning company will clean, disinfect and sanitize entire building each night. Nightly Two Times Per Week: Contracted cleaning company will deep clean all classrooms and common areas two times per week every Wednesday and Friday. Cleaning, Sanitization, and Disinfection of Affected Spaces (Confirmed COVID-19 Case) Exposure Reporting, Notification, and Disinfecting To ensure a clear and efficient process for communication, the school has identified Nurse Debbie Cozier as the internal COVID-19 point of contact (POC). This person is responsible for ensuring the below steps are followed in the event of a confirmed case of COVID-19. She will also act as the point of contact for families and staff to notify if a child or staff member test positive for COVID-19. Step 1: Report to DC Health Department In the event the school identifies a student or a staff member who has tested COVID-19 positive, Nurse Cozier will notify DC Health (DC Health guidelines) by emailing coronavirus@dc.gov with the following information; \"COVID-19 Consult\" in the email subject line Name and direct phone number of the point of contact for DC Health to return the call Short summary of the incident or situation Step 2:Communication to Families and Staff The school's communication protocols that protect the privacy of individuals and alert their families and staff to a COVID-19 case, will be enacted. Communication will include: Notification to all staff and families in the event of change of school schedule, Notification to those staff and families of students in close contact with the individual and will state the requirement to quarantine for 14 days; and Notification to the all stakeholders that there was a COVID-19 positive case and that hose impacted have been told to quarantine, and all areas that the individual was in contact with will be cleaned, sanitized, and disinfected. Notification to parents will be made through robo calls, mass emails and group texts messages to the school and parent body. Information will also be posted on the school's website. Step 3:Cleaning, Sanitization, and Disinfection of Affected Spaces In the event of a confirmed COVID-19 case of a student or staff member, the school will follow all steps outlined by DC Health and CDC guidelines for cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing. If seven days or fewer have passed since the person who is sick used the facility, the school will follow these steps: Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 4 Close off areas used by the person who is sick. Open outside doors to increase air circulation in the areas, when possible. Wait up to 24 hours or as long as possible before cleaning or disinfecting to allow respiratory droplets to settle. Clean and disinfect all areas used by the person who is sick, such as classrooms, bathrooms, and common areas. If more than seven days have passed since the person who is sick used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary. The school will continue routine cleaning and disinfecting. Use of Space The school will take the following measures in its use of space: Access to the building will be limited to two entrances which are equipped with infrared cameras for checking body temperature. Temperature readings of 100.4, will result in denied access to the building. At each designated entrance, a pre-screening questionnaire will be administered as provided by OSSE's guidance. Any individual responding with \"yes\" to any question on the pre-screener, will also be denied access to the building. Marking along walkways leading to the entrances will indicate six feet apart. Arrival and dismissal will follow a staggered schedule (more details provided later in the plan) with 30 minutes intervals. This allows for smaller, more controlled groups of students entering the building at any one time. This lessens the possibility of large gatherings. Remove unnecessary furniture to create the space needed for maximum number of students, with social distancing guidelines indoor. Students will have assigned seats throughout the day, in an assigned classroom; a cohort. The upper grades will face the same direction (rather than facing each other) to reduce transmission from virus-containing droplets (e.g., from talking, coughing, sneezing). Individual desks will all be turned to face the same direction and students will be staggered to maintain six feet distance. Students in the lower grades will sit on either end of a rectangular table, separated by the use of plastic flexible screens. Individual carpet shapes that will be cleaned daily, will be used during floor time. Each student will be assigned a single shape. The shapes will be six feet apart. No more than 3 students will be assigned at a table designed for 6, and no more than 2 students at tables designed for 4. All available space within the building will be maximized while observing 6 feet apart Limited number of occupants in any space based on the \"Phase\" per DC health requirement, currently maximum 12 individuals to any persons and an occasional 1 additional person for a brief period or as necessary to support individual student needs. The same measures will be applicable to class sessions being held outdoors. Communal-use spaces such as staff break room, library, learning pod, general conference room, cafeteria, pool and the gymnasium will be closed. Communal-use spaces which are not closed, will stagger use providing time for cleaning and disinfecting between use and maintaining six feet of distancing at all times.

Refrigerator, microwaves, etc. for staff Conference room for IEP meetings which could not be facilitated virtually Physical education classes will be held outside, weather permitting and students will maintain proper distancing using visual cues (cones to mark the ground where students should stand). No interactive activities will be permitted (e.g. basketball, football, soccer) A designated area, with its own entry way, will be available for any student or staff who exhibit symptoms, such as a fever or a cough, until the individual can be safely removed from the facility. This area will be separate from the area used for routine healthcare. The area will be sanitized once it has been used by an adult or student. Pre-K student's cots will be placed head to toe during nap times. At the end of the nap schedule, cots will be sanitized daily before being stacked for next use. Blankets and sheets will be placed in student's personal bags for safe keeping and kept in personalized cubbies. Use of Hallways Hallways will include occupant traffic flow direction marking on the floor and on the walls, maintaining one- way traffic where possible and two-way traffic separated by six feet or maximum possible where space is not sufficient. Additional signage including decals on the floor, posters with symbols and wordswill be used as needed to provide direction and instruction for movement. Stairways are designated for one-way traffic flow for ascending or descending . Ventilation We have had our outside contractor for HVAC (WL Gary) provide us with an assessment and recommendations. All filters in the building are scheduled to be replaced with MERV 14 over the next few weeks to improve air quality. The vendor will provide HVAC system cleaning as needed. Water System We intend to provide bottled water to students initially. We are also seeking proposals for touchless water fountains for refilling bottles. We will use our outside vendor for plumbing to follow the guidance below to flush all water systems.We will; Flush hot and cold water through all points of use such as sinks, drinking fountains, toilets, urinals. Water heater will be set to 140 degrees Fahrenheit and hot water will be flushed at each fixture using hot water until its maximum temperature is reached.

Regular hand sanitizing will be enforced: \"You touch it, you take it\" policy will be enforced in classrooms Preventing a Vaccine-avoidable Outbreak Preventing the spread of COVID-19 is the priority of all. However, according to the CDC data, the pandemic has reduced the administration of childhood immunization. That being said, it is imperative that all students are fully vaccinated according to the CDC and DC Health Guidelines, prior to attending in-person activities at school. Eagle Academy will do the following; Implement the immunization policy for In-Person attendance in full Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 18 Ensure a procedure is in place for frequently reviewing immunization compliance and notifying non- compliant families. Removing non-compliant students from i-person instruction after a 20-day grace period. As a part of the student enrollment process, the enrollment team/registrar will confirm that all student vaccinations are up to date prior to fully enrolling a student. If it is determined that a student has been unable to get vaccines, the enrollment team will coordinate with the student support team and school nurse to support the student in getting an up-to-date screening. In School Dining Students will eat meals in the classroom to avoid mixing in the cafeteria. Meal distribution, eating, and waste collection will occur with six feet separation coordinated with one-way traffic arrows and queue lines marked on the floor of the classroom where possible. Additionally, Students will wash hands before and after eating, and may not share food, utensils, cups, or plates. Staff will wash hands before and after preparing food, and after helping children to eat. Tables and chairs will be cleaned and sanitized before and after the meal, by either the teachers, Assistants or other school personnel as assigned. Students who have noted food allergies will be removed from the classroom when necessary, and provided with a secure eating space in the multipurpose room, which is extremely large and facilitates no contact. The following measures will be implemented; Individual seating arrangement provided. Disinfected before and after student has dined. Protective shield around the desk as the student dines. Immediately washing of the hands, replacing mask and return to classroom. The classroom of any student with a food allergy, would be cleaned and sanitized after breakfast, lunch or snack has been eaten in the space, and prior to the student who suffers from the allergy in question, rejoins the class.

PLAN STATEMENT: This plan describes how Eagle Academy will meet its mission, goals, and student academic achievement expectations as set forth in its charter agreement, as well as provide the equivalent of 1,080 instructional hours through synchronous and asynchronous remote and on-site learning opportunities. The plan provides students, families, staff, DC PCSB and OSSE with a thorough understanding of the day-to-day learning. The plan centers on equity, ensuring that all students, including students who are at risk, per the city's definition, English learners, and/or with disabilities, are able to access all learning opportunities without further compromising their health and social-emotional well-being. DESCRIPTION:Identify the instructional methods(e.g., 100 percent synchronous instruction, student-guided instruction, etc.),and platforms (e.g., the product name if using a learning management system (LMS)),and materials (e.g., textbooks, teacher-generated resources, computer software, etc.) your schools will use during the 2020-21 school year to ensure rigor across settings; Explain the total instructional hours per day for the typical student participating in your distance learning program. Provide a breakdown of anticipated hours spent in a synchronous learning environment (learning that happens in real time with the student and teacher together) and asynchronous learningenvironment (independent learning that takes place without real-time input from the teacher); Describe the training and professional development for school staff to support the effective implementation of this instructional plan; and Describe the manner in which the LEA will ensure the plan is routinely monitored and adjusted, as needed, to address the needs of every student in the LEA across learning environments. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 26 Instruction at Eagle Academy will be provided to meet the needs of family and staff who will be experiencing instruction remotely. For each of the 180 days in the school calendar, a student will be expected to engage in the equivalent of 6 hours of learning, synchronously and asynchronously. The planalso contains descriptions of how the methods and instructional strategies will strengthen the academic program in the LEA, increase the amount and quality of learning time, and help provide an enriched and accelerated curriculum, including programs and activities necessary to provide a well-rounded education Eagle will assess its instructional practices, operational procedures and student's learning by the end of the first quarter to determine what changes, if any, should be made. Included in that analysis, would also be a determination as to whether on-site learning would be safe and possible. Recommended changes will then be communicated to all stakeholders. In the event that on-site learning would become an option, Eagle Academy will allow parents the flexibility to decide which option for continuous learning, would best suit their needs. PART A Eagle Academy carefully evaluated the needs of its students to include safety measures, and determined that a full virtual model would be appropriate to successfully educate all students at for the first quarters of the 20-21 school year. The essential point of consideration was to put in place a system which would best meet the needs of all students, while ensuring that the program aligns with the current operation and health and safety guidance provided by the DC public offices and phased re-openings. An all virtual model would include a combination of Synchronous and Asynchronous Learning Cohorts Learning Platform Remote learning will be facilitated using G Suite for Education along with different google options such as the google classroom and google meet. Platforms are selected to offer opportunities for posting assignments, online activities, screen sharing during instruction, posting of sample work, assessments and discussion. These platforms also allow a teacher to edit lessons, and offer more security for students and families. The Zoom platform is being considered for the lower grades. Class Dojo will be utilized by all teachers to communicate and maintain the home school connection, involve parents and maintain direct contact. Instructional Resources All students will be instructed using the curriculum resources which Eagle has implemented over the last few years. Mathematical thinking and application will be facilitated through the use of Eureka Math of Great Minds. Teachers have individual licenses which allow them access to video lessons, tools and templates for use during their daily virtual instruction. Alongside these are independent practice workbooks and homework books for each student. In addition, students have individual access to assigned online activities in Khan Math and Xtramath. These two resources compliment the core math instruction. Literacy core instruction, is done using Houghton Mifflin Journeys which provide common core aligned grade level skills lessons. Students will be provided with independent practice workbooks. In addition, Eagle develops student's independent reading skills and levels by implementing American Reading Company's IRLA program. This provides students with access to rich, interesting leveled texts both in hard copies and electronic versions, via the company's ARC Cloud and SchoolPace.

PART C Professional Development Eagle Academy provides high quality personalized professionaldevelopmentthatisevidence- basedforteachers,principals,otherschoolleaders, specializedinstructionalsupportpersonnel,andparaprofessionals. The professional development is focused on improving teaching, student learning and achievement. During the month of August, teachers, Assistant teachers and all other instructional staff will receive training on various additional components to systems Eagle already utilizes, as well as trainings on a new platform to facilitate remote learning. SchoolPace and Arc Cloud database provided by the American Reading Company. The development will focus on training teachers to access, track students, update students power goals, plan conferencing and coaching mini lessons. In addition, teachers will receive training on how to use the digital tools and provide small group instructions remotely. Fast ForWord training will provide instruction to help teachers conduct the electronic assessments remotely and to how strategies to engage student's attendance, participation and completion rates. Google classroom trainings will be centered around setting up google classrooms, knowing and using the tools, troubleshooting and maximizing for remote learning. Trauma informed practices; providing teachers with the knowledge and the strategies necessary to support students upon their return to school and beyond. Creating safety nets for our students. Personal trauma support training for the staff. Teachers engage in one-hour Professional Learning Communities on Wednesdays and Thursdays at the end of the instructional day. This time is dedicated to trainings, team planning and data discussions. These sessions will be facilitated on a needs basis, and by different departments such as the Math Coach supporting Eureka implementation, the IRLA Support Coach and the Pre-K consultant. Teachers are provided additional time to collaborate and develop intervention support plans for students who show signs of disengagement, as well as general planning on Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays. This time is also provided for the classroom teacher to work with special education providers and coordinators. Additionally, formal instruction will end by 3:00pm daily and the teacher's work day will end at4:15pm. Each day, teachers and community leaders will have access to the IT department, behavioral support specialist, support staff, department and grade level leads, and other instructional staff to troubleshoot issues that occur both on-site and remote. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 31 A. AssessmentTimely Intervention Eagle Academy's Interventionist will support students who have been identified by the Student Support Team, analysis of data, as needing additional small group or individual instruction, in order to be successful. These interventionists will push in to classrooms or use break-out rooms to meet with students and offer strategies and resources to help the student succeed. The team of interventionist will also work closely with the lead teachers in identify student gaps, factors impacting the student learning, and providing or identifying resource needed. PART D Continuous Improvement Eagle Academy will be in operation for 180 days. The schedule will be based on the quarterly grading period to allow for updates and changes to meet the immediate needs and to adjust to the current DC reopening phase. All changes to school scheduling will occur on the planned review dates which coincide with the end of each grading period, except if there is a state-wide directive to return school to it's normal schedule on site. Once per week during the period September through February, Eagle's data team will hold weekly data check points by grade levels, to review and plan, gathering data from on-site, remote synchronous and remote asynchronous. At the mid-point of the school year, Eagle would evaluate and determine if monthly data meetings with each grade level, would continue to drive instruction in a meaningful manner. In addition to the weekly data check points, The MTSS team will engage in quarterly (September, February, May) school-wide data analysis of student performance on formative assessments, disaggregated by schedule type (on-site, remote synchronous, remote asynchronous). The analysis will control for other variables (e.g. attendance, social- emotional status and special education status) to confirm that each mode of content instruction is providing equitable results for student learning and growth. Future professional development will be planned based on the results of the analysis. If it is determined that some instructional strategies are more (or less) effective than others, these will be replicated, replacing the less effective strategies. Once a month, students, who have shown the least engagement whether by attendance or work product, will be evaluated through a student support team. The team will determine the potential cause of disengagement, from equipment or Wi-Fi issues, to mental health to difficulties with content. Depending on the results, the student may be asked to change their schedule, receive interventions and support or be evaluated. All students will take a social emotional learning assessment two times per year. Based on the results, modifications will be made to the learning plan for cohorts or individual students. NWEA-MAP ; Reading Inventory (RI) 6a.Describe the LEA's policy for identifying and administering assessments during the 2020-21 school year, including: Which formative assessment(s) the LEA will use to measure student learning (and learning loss) at the start of the 2020-21 school year? 6b.Describe the LEA's policy for identifying and administering assessments during SY 2020-21, including: How the LEA will plan to assess students who either do not attend school regularly in person, or who participate exclusively in distance learning. Describe the specific modalities you plan to use to ensure Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 32 PART B As a result of the 2020 Pandemic, a review of assessment tools for SY 2020 -2021 was conducted to best identity tools to monitor student growth over time and also inform areas of instruction requiring intervention. The leadership team comprised of the Director of Education, Director of Special Education, principals, teachers and the data team, all members of the Multi-Tiered System of Support, reviewed data reports including those from previous years. The assessment tools reviewed are part of the Eagle Academy DCPCS Performance Management Framework. The comprehensive reporting systems for both, Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA) and Teaching Strategies Gold provides patterns and trends for student outcomes for each of our students. These valuable reports inform the instructional program. Based on the review of all the factors available at this time, Eagle Academy will continue in the SY 2020 - 2021 utilizing both NWEA MAP for grades K-3 and Teaching Strategies Gold Measures for PreK3 and PreK4. In SY2019 -2020, Eagle Academy implemented a Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) to sustain the school's three student learning goals of having all graduating 3 rdgrade students reading on grade level, demonstrating social- emotional competence, and exhibiting competent critical thinking. TheMTSS is a systemic, prevention-based, continuous-improvement framework in which team-driven, data-based problem solving and decision-making is practiced across all levels of the educational system for improving the outcomes of every student through family, school, and community partnering, and a layered continuum of evidence-based practices applied at the classroom, school and district levels. These processes will continue for SY 2020 -2020. Eagle Academy has been using the Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA) Measures of Academic Progress (MAP)'s Growth assessment for the past 7 years to measure what students know and inform what they are ready to learn next. By dynamically adapting to each student's responses, NWEA MAP Growth creates a personalized assessment experience that accurately measures performance. NWEA MAP Growth will be used as the basis for the academic portion of the MTSS framework. We will continue to use this assessment for SY2020 - 2021, All Eagle Academy students, K through third grade will participate in the NWEA MAP Growth Reading and Math assessment three times per year to identify students who are at greatest risk for failing to demonstrate academic growth. Interventions will be designed and implemented to ensure academic growth based on student need. Eagle Academy's MTSS Coordinator and At-Risk Team will meet every 4-6 weeks to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, and adjust accordingly based on progress monitoring data. The academic universal screener MAP Growth will be administered three times per year, and students who score in the 25 thpercentile or below will receive RTI Tier 2 targeted group interventions. Students scoring in the 10 thpercentile or below will be served in RTI Tier 3 intensive, small group interventions. Progress monitoring will be completed every other week for students receiving Tier 2 supports, and weekly for students receiving Tier 3 supports. Documentation of interventions will be provided to the respective instructors to ensure fidelity of implementation. Teaching Strategies Gold Assessment tool will be continued to be utilized at the PreK3 and PreK4. This measure has been in place at Eagle Academy for eight years. Teaching Strategies reports the formative assessment will assess COVID-19 learning loss, meet children's individual needs, and ensure all children can progress. The tool provides an ongoing reporting system for parents to report student growth. Teaching Strategies Gold Assessment provides a management tool to report ongoing progress throughout the school year with reviews at beginning of school (BOY), middle of school year (MOY) and the end of the school year (EOY). The LEA also plans to assess students who either do not attend school regularly in person, or who participate exclusively in distance learning as outlined. every student is assessed (e.g., at-home diagnostic assessments, online proctoring, physically in the building). Describe if modalities differ by grade bands; and When the LEA intends to administer these assessments during the school year, specifying for each assessment. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 33 B. Promotion and GraduationEagle Academy will create the conditions for assessing students who participate exclusively in distance learning. The adjusted window for NWEA MAP testing permits multiple approaches to provide the school community with the opportunity to assess students. All students physically attending school will take the assessment with the assigned classroom teacher. Students who do not attend school regularly in person will be assessed on the days they are present. Parents/guardians will be advised of the assessment schedule and asked to send their child to school. For our students who participate exclusively in distance learning, we will follow NWEA testing administration guidelines for MAP Growth. The key element of the guidelines provided by NWEA states: \"One critical difference is the need for clear communication between proctors, students, and families who will be participating from two different locations. As during past MAP Growth test administrations, school leaders need to communicate their expectations, procedures, and protocols.Proctors need to be trained and ready to support students as they take MAP Growth assessments remotely. \" The Office of Research, Innovation and Accountability at Eagle Academy will be responsible to work with the school leaders and proctors to adhere to the structures and processes identified by NWEA MAP in their guidance for remote assessment. A parent toolkit will be provided in addition to a virtual parent meeting for parents/guardians for students working remotely. Eagle Academy will utilize schoolwide technology. Every classroom has a ceiling-mounted camera that records all instructional lessons. Authorized personnel can view the entire testing sessions in every classroom during testing -- live. PART C The assessment calendar will reflect testing for the beginning of school (BOY), middle of school year (MOY) and the end of the school year (EOY). Eagle Academy's grading policy will remain the same for this school year. That is, assigning a numeric value to the skills taught during each 9 weeks grading period. 4\u2014Student has exceeded Grade Level Standards 3\u2014Student has reached Grade Level Standards 2\u2014Student is Approaching Grade Level Standards 1\u2014Student is not on Track to reach Grade Level Standards NOT APPLICABLE. 7.Describe if/how student grading and promotion policies will be altered in light of distance learning.

Parents can anticipate monthly communications from the school regarding general information such as scheduling, events and updates/changes to policies and procedures. The main forms of communication will be via school newsletters, school website, principals' coffee parent meetings which will start off via Zoom virtual meetings, and as updates with COVID change meetings will evolve into in person with social distance guidelines being kept. Other meetings that will be held are the typical PTO meetings, Title 1 meetings with parents, and monthly town-hall meetings where general information is shared. Communication with families will continue as via email, zoom video chat meetings, and by automated phone calls. Additionally, any information needed to be shared with parents beyond the monthly communications, will be shared utilizing the same methods on an as needed basis. Principals will host ongoing Town Hall Meetings via zoom, on grade levels so as to allow individual voices, more interaction and grade specific concerns to be addressed. Weekly parent meetings will be scheduled on Fridays by teachers, to reflect, review and update parents. Personal meetings between parents and school leaders can be scheduled via email and conducted over the phone or on zoom call, or depending on the health guidelines in place. PART B Eagle Academy is aware of the importance of family feedback. Especially during this time, when things are ever changing to fit the country's current climate. Family contribution will continue to come through a number of ways: students/families can consistently contribute their input regarding continuous learning by utilizing online parent surveys, these surveys are created through the leadership and data team, the data team takes previous analyzed information to compile new questions with the leadership team giving feedback on the most efficient questions to ask. Monthly virtual town hall meetings via Zoom will be held. This is a time where leadership team members will share general information as well as allow parents to as questions or share comments with other families and leadership staff. On a more personal platform monthly PTO meetings will continue where parents can speak one on one with teachers, and schedule if a principal or school leader needs to be present. Principals will also conduct \"principals' coffee parent meetings\" this will begin virtual, and as the current state changes, evolve into social distanced in person meetings, where parents can speak with principals on more independent matters. Lastly there are suggestion boxes virtually where parents can drop comments, questions and concerns, which will be addressed in the parent newsletter or with a follow PART C In the event of an unanticipated facility closure or health/safety issue, Eagle Academy will communicate immediately with families by mass email, automated text messages, automated phone calls, Zoom meetings and school memorandums.

If more than seven days have passed since the person who is sick used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection would discontinue. PART D Eagle will share expectations for family participation in their student's learning by conducting virtual and/or in-person orientations (on a limited basis). These meetings will consist of more extensive information and explanations regarding expectations in the parent handbook, monthly school newsletters, and memos shared. There will also be information shared through parent/teacher conferences. Eagle Academy's Leadership team will provide parents with trainings focused on student learning and technology by hosting content or technique specific quarterly. Teachers will also facilitate trainings of their classroom community as needed. Parents will be provided with resources for accessing additional training and information beyond Eagle resources via monthly newsletters and emails. Eagle will continuously survey families for feedback to ensure information is being shared efficiently, is useful and is understood. PART E Eagle Academy's Leadership Team is working in tandem with the Human Resources Team to make ensure onboarding and introductions for teachers is as detailed and informative as possible. New teachers feeling welcome, and getting acclimated is incredibly important, especially with classroom teaching being different than past years due to COVID 19. New teachers will also need to be introduced and made familiar with their students and the families they are servicing. Teachers will meet families at the scheduled Family Town Hall Meetings, as well as virtual orientation meetings in August. Parents and students will also have an opportunity to meet individually with their new teacher in person when retrieving Resource packets for virtual learning. New teachers and existing staff will also be introduced during Pre-Service activities planned on a staggered schedule, observing guidelines for safety and social distancing.
