In recent decades, research has expanded beyond detailing its nutritional composition and delved into the biological activities and potential health benets of its constituents. Many bioactive constituents from a range of families have been isolated from different parts of the mushroom, including carbohydrates, protein, lipids, glycoproteins, phenols, and sesquiterpenes. These compounds have been demonstrated to exhibit various biological activities, such as antitumour and anticancer activities, anti-atherosclerotic and thrombosis inhibition activity, antihypertensive and cholesterol lowering effects, anti-aging and antioxidant properties, ability to aid with restoring memory and overcoming learning decits, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-bacterial, ribosome inactivation and melanosis inhibition. This review aims to consolidate the information concerning the phytochemistry and biological activities of various compounds isolated from F.velutipes to demonstrate that this mushroom is not only a great source of nutrients but also possesses tremendous potential in pharmaceutical drug development. Keywords: Flammulinavelutipes, enoki, mushroom, nutritional value, biological activity INTRODUCTION In addition to their nutritional value, folk medicine has long recognized mushrooms for their wide spectrum of therapeutic and prophylactic uses. Many medicinal mushrooms al., 2006 ). While their properties remained unknown to the scientic community for a long time, in recent decades, there has been signicant research focused on the sources, medicinal properties and applications of mushrooms ( Encarnacion et al., 2012; Kala c, 2013; Soares et al., 2013 ).Tang et al. Flammulinavelutipes From a nutritional stand point, these health promoting mushrooms have high nutritional value. They contain dietar y ber,arelowincalories,haveahighcontentofproteinconsi sting of all the essential amino acids, minerals and vitamins and are free of cholesterol ( Karaman et al., 2010 ). Beyond their nutritionalvalue,mushroomshavegreatpotentialforproduc tion of useful metabolites, making them a prolic resource for drug isolation and development ( Leung et al., 1997 ). Mushrooms are now gaining worldwide recognition as a functional food as well as a potential source of nutraceuticals which may reduce severity of, prevent or treat illnesses. The current research on these medicinal mushrooms has, in fact, now progressed beyond validating their traditional medical use s and into the isolation and production of bioactive compounds against specic illnesses ( Wang et al., 2012c; Liu et al., 2014). F. velutipes is also commonly known as enokitake, velvet shank or golden needle mushroom retrieved from MycoBank website http://www.mycobank.org, 1st August 2016). The cultivated F. velutipes has a pure white bean sprout look with a velvety stem topped with a tiny snowy- white cap; while the wild varieties appear in dierent colors ranging from orange to brown, and have a larger, shiny cap. The signicant dierence in the appearance of wild and the cultivated F. velutipes is attributed to the cultivation of F. velutipes without the exposure to light which leads to its white color while the wild ones are brown. F. velutipes normally grows on dead elm trees and has been found abundantly on diseased elm trees caused by Dutch elm infecti on (Ingold, 1980 ). The species of Flammulina have also been reported to occur ubiquitously on a wide variety of deciduous trees such as poplar, plum, maple and birch ( Sharma et al., 2009). F. velutipes (Curtis) Singer is one of the most popular edible mushrooms that possesses a wide spectrum of interestin g biological activities. It is found ubiquitously throughout the north-temperate regions including North America, Europe and Asia (Ingold, 1980 ). Historically, it has been has been cultivated for consumption and medicinal use in China since 800 AD. Currently, F. velutipes is among the four most widely cultivated mushrooms globally due to its desirable taste, aroma and hig h nutritional value. It is commonly available in the market or groceries stores sold in vacuum packages. This mushroom is also well known for its curative properties for liver diseases and gastroentericulcers( We aim to give an overview of the present knowledge regarding the bioactive chemical constituents and pharmacological potentialof F.velutipes.TAXONOMIC CLASSIFICATION Agaricales Family Physalacriaceae Genus Flammulina Species F.velutipes CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND NUTRITIONAL VALUE OF F.VELUTIPES Similar to many other edible mushrooms, F. velutipes is consumedasadelicacy,notedforthepleasantaromaandtextur e it gives to a dish. More importantly, consuming F. velutipes can provide key nutrients such as proteins, vitamins, minerals, unsaturated fatty acids and ber. Additionally, consumption ofF. velutipes can confer health promoting eects including immunity enhancement, blood cholesterol and blood pressure lowering eects as well as chemopreventive eects by virtue of the bioactive constituents contained in the mushroom which are ingested during consumption. However, it is important to note that the composition of the benecial compounds present inF. velutipes can be highly influenced by the growing site, types of substrate, maturity of the mushroom at the harvestin g stageandalsothepost-harvesthandlingincludingtheprocess ing and storage conditions. All these factors could account for t he variability in composition data published by dierent studies examining the same mushroom, in addition to the intraspecic genetic variability of mushrooms from dierent provenance an d producers ( Reis et al., 2012 ). We have consolidated the data available in the current literature reporting the nutrient a nalysis ofF. velutipes collected from several regions in order to provide further insight into the nutritional benets of consuming th is mushroom. Based on the ndings of Kalac (2013), the dry matter of both wild and cultivated mushrooms is relatively low, usually withi n therangeof80-140g/kg.For F. velutipes ,thedry matterofboth wild and cultivated F. velutipes are within the normally reported range for mushrooms, measuring between 93 and 114 g/kg (Dikeman et al., 2005; Ko et al., Ranogajec, 2011; Reis et al., 2012 ). The low dry matter of the mushrooms accounts for their high water content that leads to shorter s helf life of the fruiting bodies. However, in a comparison among cultivated mushrooms, Dikeman et al. (2005) found that the dry matter of cultivated raw F. velutipes was the highest among the othercultivatedmushroomssampledforthestudy.However,t his wasnotthecaseforthestudiesthatexaminedthewild F.velutipes from European regions Ranogajec, 2011; Pereira et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, the dry matter content of F. velutipeswas reduced after cooking while the dry matter of the Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org 2 December 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 474Tang et al.

The data on approximate composition and energy value of both wild and cultivated F. velutipes are summarized in Table1. Allthestudiesreviewedshowedthatcarbohydratesandprote ins are the two major constituents contained in the dry matter of F. velutipes . No obvious dierence is seen in carbohydrate and protein content between the wild and cultivated F. velutipes . Given the fact that, similar to other mushrooms, F. velutipes has low dry matter and fats content, it is thus a low energy delicacy.Furthermore,thecalculatedenergyvalueissugg estedto besomewhatoverestimatedassomeofthecarbohydratesareo nly partially digestible or indigestible, such as chitin and man nitol (Kalac, 2013). It is interesting to note that a slight dierence can beobservedbetweentheenergyvalueofwildandthecultivate dF. velutipes,wheretheenergyvalueofcultivated F.velutipes appears higher than ranging from 410.1 to 459.3 kcal/kgfreshweightandfrom342.0to398.2kcal/kgfreshwe ight, respectively. followingequation:Energy(kcal) =4\u00d7(gcarbohydrate) +3.75 \u00d7(gprotein) +9\u00d7(gfat)(Reisetal.,2012 ).

The protein content of F. velutipes is comparable to many green leafyvegetables\u2014intherangeof200-300g/kgdryweight( Singh etal.,2001;Guptaetal.,2005 )\u2014demonstratingthat F.velutipes is a good source of protein. Several unique studies even quanti edthe concentration of amino acids from F. velutipes . Amino acids aretheimportantmonomericbuildingblocksofproteinsandca n further classied into two classes, the essential and noness ential amino acids. The essential amino acids can only be obtained through dietary intake while the non-essential amino acids a re thosethatcanbesynthesizedbythebody.Varyingconcentra tions of free amino acids contained in F. velutipes demonstrated inthestudiesreviewed( Table2)(Smiderleetal.,2008;Kimetal., 2009; Beluhan and Ranogajec, 2011 ). Based on these studies, the major amino acids found in F. velutipes were L-glutamic acid, L-alanine, glycine and L-lysine, which contributed 2 .6- 3.0% of dry weight. Furthermore, essential amino acids such as methionine,valine,isoleucine,leucine,lysine,phenylala nineand threonineweredetectedin 2011 ). Amino acids also play an important role in contributing to the pleasant taste of mushrooms.Forinstance,asparticandglutamicacidsarethet wo amino acids that contribute the monosodium glutamate-like or palatable taste while the alanine, glycine, threonine and seri ne give a sweet taste to the mushrooms. Beluhan and Ranogajec (2011)found that among the amino acids in F. velutipes, amino acidsthatgive MSG-like taste made up the highestcomposition , followedbysweet,bitterandtastelessaminoacids.Thestud yalso showed that among a variety of mushrooms, the total content of amino acids that determined the taste characteristics of F. velutipes was the lowest at 27.87 mg/g dry weight, F. velutipes Beluhan andRanogajec,2011 ). Besides that, various bioactive proteins isolated from F. velutipes . Fungal immunomodulatory protein, FIP-fve, mainly extracted from fruiting body of F. velutipes has been studied extensively and explored for its diverse bioactivitiesincludingimmunomodulatory,anticanceran danti- inflammatory properties ( Chang et al., 2013, 2014; Lee et al., 2013). Ribosome inactivating proteins such as flammin, velin, velutin and flammulin are present in the fruiting bodies and extract of the mushroom ( Wang and Ng, 2000, 2001; Ng and Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org 3 December 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 474Tang et al.

Carbohydrates in F. velutipes can be categorized into three monosaccharides such -glucan and starch ( Dikeman et al., ). The concentration of each individualgroup of carbohydrates contained in F. velutipes is tabulated in Table3. The observed dierences in sugar content may be due to geographical factors such as soil conditions, as well as the cultivationmethodandalsotheanalyticalmethodused.Gluc ose and trehalose were the two major sugar components detected in both wild and cultivated F. velutipes (Dikeman et al., 2005; Kim et et al., was indicated that sugars participate incellularenergymetabolismandalsothesynthesisofstruct ural polysaccharidesofthemushroom( Barrosetal.,2008 ).Moreover, sugars are only a small portion of the total carbohydrate cont ent while the remaining portion consists of other polysaccharides suchasstarch,chitinand -glucan. Recently, there have been increased investigations into the bioactivities of polysaccharides extracted from both th e fruiting body and mycelium of F. velutipes .F. velutipes derived polysaccharides were found to possess many health promoting properties, such as antioxidant and anticancer activity,immunomodulation,hepatocyteprotectionandeven the ability to treat learning and memory impairment ( Pang et al., 2007; He and Zhang, 2013; Wu et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2015 ) (Zhang et al., 2013 ).

Carbohydrate content also includes dietary ber, which is known to be high in mushrooms. According to Kalac (2013), both insoluble and soluble dietary ber content were shown t o make up between 4.2-9.2% and 22.4-31.2% of dry weight in mushrooms. Dikeman et al. (2005) revealed that approximately 29.3% of the dry weight of raw F. velutipes consists of dietary bers; with 90% of the total dietary ber being insoluble whi le the remaining 10% is soluble. Furthermore, it was found that the total dietary ber content increased as a result of cooki ng forF. velutipes (Dikeman et al., 2005 ). A previous study also demonstrated that the high dietary ber content of F. velutipes extractconferredhypolipidemiceect,loweringtotalcholes terol levelsinanimalsonahighfatdiet( Yehetal.,2014 ). Lipids and Fatty Acids mushrooms are a low energy delicacy with a caloric value of approximately 350 kcal per kg owing to its low dry matter and lipid content ( Kalac, 2013). The lipid content of F. velutipes falls in the range of 17.3-73.3 g/kg dry weight and is composed of sterols, sphingolipids and fats ( Ko et 2011; Akata et al., 2012; Pereira et a l., 2012). The total fatty acid content (in terms of dry weight basis)ofF.velutipes consistspredominantlyofmonounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (79.23%) while saturated fat acids make up the remaining 20.67% ( G\u00fcn\u00e7 Erg\u00f6n\u00fcl et al., 2013).Table4summarizesthepercentagesoftheindividualfatty acids detected velutipes . Linoleic acid is the major fatty acid contained in F. velutipes , making up 40.93-56.33% of theTABLE 4 | Main fatty acids (percentage) found in F.velutipes . Main fatty Percentage (%) References et 2012; G\u00fcn\u00e7 Erg\u00f6n\u00fcl et al., 2013 total fatty acid content. Linoleic acid is an essential fatt y acid for mammals and is the precursor for biosynthesis of many importantinflammatorymediatorssuchasarachidonicacidan d prostaglandinsinmammals( Salemetal.,1999 ).Thus,F.velutipes may represent an important food source for humans or other animals to obtain sucient amounts of the essential fatty ac ids ourbodyrequiresbutwhichcannotbesynthesized.Manystud ies alsodemonstratedthatsterolsextractedfrom F.velutipes possess antiproliferativeactivityagainstseveralcancercellline sandhave the potential to be developed as chemotherapeutic agents ( Yi et al., 2012, 2013a ); while mycosterol, derived from the extract ofF. velutipes, exhibits potent hypolipidemic activity ( Yeh et al., 2014). Micronutrients The ash content in mushrooms generally ranges within 5-12% of dry matter and 72.5-104.0 g/kg of ash was reported in F. velutipes (Ko et al., 2007; Beluhan and Ranogajec, al., 2012; Pereira et al., 2012 ). The concentration of elements contained in F. velutipes are tabulated in Table5. Similar to Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org 5 December 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 474Tang et al. Flammulinavelutipes TABLE 5 | Content of major mineral elements in F.velutipes .

This indicates that a 100g portion of F. velutipes can contribute to around 9% of the recommended daily intake of potassium which is 3100 mg/day according to FDA ( Akhter et al., 2003 ). The high potassium and low sodium content may also make F. velutipes of potential benet in a salt restricted diet for suitable for those with hypertension or heart disease. In fact, studies al so suggested that potassium from fruit and vegetables can reduc e blood pressure ( John et al., 2002; He et al., 2006 ). The other mineralspresentinminoramountsincludecopper,iron,zincan d sulfur, which are also important supplementary elements in our diet (Smiderle et al., 2008 ). It is also interesting to note that the wildAustralian F.velutipes containhighercopperandpotassium levelsascomparedtootherAustralianmushroomsspecies( Zeng etal.,2012 ). It has been demonstrated that the vitamin content in mushrooms are species and source-dependent ( Pereira et al., 2012; Nakalembe et al., 2015 ).According to Pereira et al. (2012) , F. velutipes was shown to contain tocopherols ( tocopherol and -tocopherol, but not -tocopherol) (0.6 \u00b5g/g dry weight), ascorbic acid (238 \u00b5g/g dry weight), -carotene (3.4\u00b5g/g dry weight) and lycopene (0.2 \u00b5g/g dry weight). These vitamins or micronutrients may play an important role in contributing to the mushroom's antioxidant activity ( Breene, 1990;Pereiraetal.,2012 ). Health Promoting macronutrients micronutrients present in F. velutipes, phenolics, especially the phenolic acids which are known to be the main antioxidants in the mushroom, have been detected ( Kim et al., 2008; Rahman et al., 2015 ). Phenolics are heterocyclic compounds and well-recognized for their potent antioxidant activity; they are particularly eective i n protecting the body against diseases associated with oxidat ive stresses such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabet es.Rahmanetal.(2015) identiedseveralpolyphenolicantioxidants presentinthemethanol:dichloromethanefractionof F.velutipes, including the acid (3). These bioactive phenolic and polyphenolic compounds confer the antioxidative eect of F. velutipes in preventing the progression of atherosclerosis ( Rahman et al., 2015). Gallic acid (4), pyrogallol (5), homogentisic acid (6), 5-sulfosalicylic acid (7), chlorogenic acid (8), caeic acid (9), ferulic acid (10), and quercetin (11)are other examples of phenolic compounds detected in F. velutipes, ranging from 9.0 to 26.0 \u00b5g/g dry weight ( Kim et al., 2008 ). The chemical structures of these bioactive compounds are illustrated in Figure1.Interestingly,aninterspeciescomparisonstudyby Zeng et al. (2012) showed that F. velutipes had the highest phenolic content of 2.823 \u00b10.007mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g extract among other mushrooms harvested from Australia. Th e study also suggested the variation in the phenolic content in those mushrooms may be ascribed to the dierent geographical locations and also dependent on the ability of a particular sub - species in the synthesis of phenolic compounds ( Zeng et al., 2012). In addition, various novel sesquiterpenes and norsequiterpenes were also identied from the extract of F. velutipes. These compounds exhibited several bioactivities such as anticancer, antibacterial Lovastatin, (12)which is eective in lowering cholesterol levels, was detected in the fruiting bodies of F. velutipes, estimated at 90.8 \u00b12.0mg/kg dry weight ( Chen et al., 2012). In summary, F. velutipes has excellent nutritional content\u2014 high protein and carbohydrate content, low fat content and al so high polyunsaturated fatty acid content, making it an excelle nt food suitable for low calorie diet. However, as noted, there are dierences in the chemical composition between the cultivate d and the wild samples of F. velutipes , including carbohydrates, proteins and fatty acid proles. the current literatu re, itshouldbenotedthatdataondigestibilityandbioavailab ilityof F. velutipes or indeed any other mushrooms are still lacking. In future, more studies could explore the bioavailability of spe cic nutrients or bioactive constituents contained in F. velutipes as well as investigate the changes in the individual constituen ts during dierent preservation methods, storage conditions an d dierentcookingprocesses. BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF F.VELUTIPES F. velutipes has been reported to have and antioxidan t properties, ability to restore neurotransmitters associate d with memory and learning, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and anti-bacterial activities ( Gu and Leonard, 2006; et al., 2010;Lee et al., 2013;Wu et al., 2014;Rahmanet al., 2 015; Yang et al., 2015 ). These biological activities of F. velutipes are summarized in Table6; a summary of the biological activities of F.velutipes inagraphicalfromisdepictedin Figure2.

Experimental evidence also demonstrated that F. velutipes extract possesses anticancer properties, and several antican cer compounds have been isolated from F. velutipes in recent decades. Gu and Leonard (2006) , among others, revealed the anticancer potential of fruiting bodies extract from F. velutipes, which was particularly eective against breast cancer cell lines. In the study, F. velutipes extract was shown to inhibit the growth of both estrogen-receptor positive (ER +) MCF-7 and estrogen-receptor negative (ER ) MDA-MB-231 humanbreastcancercelllines.Furthermore,theextractin duced apoptosis the breast cancer cells and also caused 99% inhibition of colony formation of MCF-7 ( Gu and Leonard, 2006).Recently, several novel bioactive compounds with anticancer activities were isolated from the cultures of F. velutipes. A research group from China discovered a sesquiterpene with a novel carbon skeleton, known as flammulinol A (13), together with sterpuric acid (14), an and six isolactarane-related norsesquiterpenes (flammulinolides A -G) (15to21) from the solid culture (Wang et al., 2012c). These isolactarane-related norsesquiterpenes (15to17, 19to21)extracted from the solid culture of F. velutipes were found to possess cytotoxic eect against several cancer cell lines. Flammulinolide A ( 15) showed cytotoxic eect against KB cells (human nasopharyngeal carcinoma) and HepG2 (human hepatocellularlivercarcinoma)withanIC 50of3.6and34.7 \u00b5M, respectively, whereas flammulinolide C cytotoxicityagainstHeLacells(humancervicaladenocarci noma) with an IC 50of 3.0 \u00b5M (Wang et al., 2012c ). Other groups have reported from 7(breastcancercells),SGC7901(stomachcancercells),andA 549 (lung cancer cells) with IC to 100 \u00b5g /mL (Wang etal.,2012d ).Anewnonsesquiterpenealkaloid (31)derivedfrom Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org 13 December 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 474Tang et al. Flammulinavelutipes fermented rice substrate of F. velutipes was also discovered to exhibitinhibitoryeectagainsthumanKBcells invitro(Xuetal., 2013). Aside from sesquiterpenes, bioactive also velutipes demonstrated antitumor and anticancer properties against sarcoma SC-180 mouse hepatoma SMMC-7721 cellsin vitro(Leung et al., 1997; 1999 ). Recently, crude polysaccharide from mycelia of the mushroom was also foundtoreducetheproliferationofhumanBEL-7402lungcanc er cells by 45% at 640 \u00b5g/mL (Zhao et al., 2013 ). Triple helix structured polysaccharides extracted by ultrasonic wave fr omF. velutipesexhibited high inhibitory eect against BGC-82 gastric cancer cells, suggesting a potential role in prevention of gas tric carcinoma ( Yang et al., 2012 ). Beta-glucan, which is well known for its antitumor activity ( Zhang et ergosterol (32)(54.8%) and 22, 23-dihydroergosterol (33) (27.9%), were found to be potential therapeutic agents against stomach, liver, lung cancer and gliomas. It showed potent antiproliferative activity against human SGC cells (stomac h cancer cells) with an IC \u00b5g/mL, HepG-2 cells with IC50at 9.3 with IC U251 glioblastoma with (Yi et al., 2012, 2013a,b ). Studies have also been done to improve the bioavailability, biodistribution and solubility of st erols (3)(Rahmanetal.,2015 )whichhaveanticancereects( HT-29 and HCT 16 cell lines, respectively ( Ferguson et al., 2005; Seeram et al., 2005 ). Ellagic acid was shown to be able to reduce hepatic P450 level and also its catalytic activities in vitro, thus decreasing the metabolism of carcinogens that can caus e chemicallyinducedcancer( Ahnetal.,1996 ). ThebiologicalactivitiesofFIP-fve,abioactiveproteinis olated from the mushroom F. velutipes, have also been investigated extensively. FIP-fve belongs to a fungal immunomodulatory protein (FIP) family that modulates immune responses, including antitumor activity ( Chang et al., 2013 ).Chang et al. (2010)suggested that FIP-fve is able to reduce the expression of RACGAP1 gene and also reduce its reporter activity ( Chang et al., 2013 ). The RACGAP1 gene is responsible for the survival and metastatic activity of lung cancer cells, thus, silenci ng of this gene reduces the migration of cancer cells ( Wang et al., 2011). Besides that, FIP-fve also increased tumor suppressor gene p53 expression and also its downstream gene, p21, thus attenuating the proliferation of A549 lung cancer cells ( Chang et al., 2013 ). In another study, Chang et al. (2010) demonstrated that the oral administration of FIP-fve reduced the tumor size of BNL hepatoma-bearing mice and suggested that the antitumor eect was mediated by IFN- -induced tumor growthinhibitioneectinvolvingbothinnateandspecicimmunitya nd ERK/MAPK signaling pathway. The study also showed that the antitumor eect of FIP-fve was mediated through the inhibiti on of angiogenesis by CD4+T-cell-derived IFN- . In addition, the study showed that the expression of MHC class I and II and co- stimulatory molecule CD80 peripheral APCs ( Chang et al., 2010 ). These ndings are in concordancewithanother invivostudywherebyFIP-fveprotein activated the maturation splenic dendritic cells, an APC and stimulated antigen-specic CD8+T-cell immune responses. Administration of FIP-fve as adjuvant therapy along with HPV-16 E7 vaccine to tumor bearing mice resulted in increase d production of HPV-16 E7-specic antibodies and increased expansion of HPV-16 CD4+and CD8+T cells compared with HPV-16 E7 vaccine alone, resulting prolonged lifespan of the mice ( Ding et al., 2009). Overall, the evidence is strongly suggestive that FIP-fve is a potential agent for the development of novel adjuvants for cancerimmunotherapy. Glycoproteins found in the fruiting ofF. velutipes also exhibit anticancer Zhang et 2007). Proflamin, an acidic glycoprotein isolated from the mycelium enhanced several immunosuppression processes and exhibited antiproliferative eects against various cancer c ells. It was demonstrated to be able to prolong the lifespan of mice bearing B-16 melanoma and adenocarcinoma 755 tumor cells (Ikekawa et al., 1985 ). When given as combination therapy along with vaccines or surgery, it also inhibited the growth of sarcoma S-180, L1210 leukemia ascite cells and another polysaccharide, inhibited the proliferati on of Meth-Abrosarcoma.SimilartoFIP-fve,theantitumoreects of EA6whicharemanifestedbyvirtueofstrengtheningthespeci c and innate immunity, were shown to be mediated by CD4+ T cells (Maruyama and Ikekawa, 2007 ). To date, it is obvious that many bioactive compounds with eective anticancer and antitumor properties have been isolated from dierent parts of F. velutipes, indicating that this mushroom is a good source for future development of chemotherapeutic agents. Nevertheles s, studies are still required to further study the bioavailabi lity of these bioactive compounds derived from Anti-Atherosclerotic and Thrombosis Inhibition Oxidizedlowdensitylipoprotein(ox-LDL)haslongbeenknown to be the key player in the early events of the atherosclerosis cascade.Lipidhydroperoxidesareformedwhenpolyunsaturate d fatty acid is oxidized by free radicals, and the continuous oxidation and reduction of the hydroperoxides will further augment the peroxidation process. Recently, Rahman et al. (2015)demonstrated the polyphenolic compounds present in methanol:dichloromethane(M:DCM)fractionof F.velutipes are able to retard LDL oxidation, thus possibly being eective in Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org 14 December 2016 | Volume 7 | 474Tang fraction of F. velutipes that showed the longest lag time of conjugated diene formation and inhibition of TBARS formation ( Rahman et al., 2015 ). The study suggested that the inhibitionoftheperoxidationprocessesmaybeattributedto the chain breaking actions of the phenolic compounds which are able to reduce the alkoxyl or peroxyl radicals to alkoxides or hydroperoxides, respectively, interfering with the peroxida tion process ( Rice-Evans et al., 1997 ). In addition, the study also proposed that the antiatherosclerotic eect demonstrated by the M:DCM fraction of F. velutipes may be mediated through anti-inflammatory eects. Protocatechuic acid (1)is known to prevent the monocytes to tumor necrosis factor- alpha(TNF- )activated endothelial cells, leading to a reduction of the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM- 1), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and also nucl ear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF- B) binding activity, thus reducing the formation of atherom a (Kakkar and Bais, 2014 ). Another phenolic constituent of the p-coumaric acid (2)is able to inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation, interrupt the arachidonic acid cascad e and decrease thromboxane B2 and lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandin E2 production, hence inhibiting the formation of plaque and inflammation process ( Luceri et al., 2007 ). In conclusion, the phenolic components in F. velutipes, which have high ability toward withstanding the oxidation of LDL as wel l as their anti-inflammatory activity, may be the agents contrib uting totheoverallanti-atheroscleroticpropertiesoftheextrac t. Thrombosis is one of the important initial events that takes place during accelerated atherosclerosis ( Walters et al., 1994 ). One study revealed that the use of F. velutipes in fermentation may produce fermented products which possess preventive activity against thrombosis. It has been demonstrated that the addition of F. velutipes in fermentation process resulted in end- product with a prolonged thrombin clotting time (358.6 \u00b10.4 sec)of2.2-foldthanthatofthecontrol.Furtherexperiment ation has also demonstrated a strong brinolytic activity on a br in plate (Okamura et al., 2001 ). A more recent study successfully puriedandcharacterizedabrinolyticenzymefromthecult ure supernatant of F. velutipes mycelium (FVP-I), a protease from F. a direct-acting brinolytic and brinogenolyti agent which elicits direct thus demonstrati ng potentialasthrombolytictherapy( Parketal.,2007 ).Collectively, the evidence suggests that F. velutipes is a potential source of bioactive substances for drug development in vascular disea se prevention. Antihypertensive and Cholesterol-Lowering Effect Almost 17 million deaths, approximately 1/3 of the total death s in a year are due to cardiovascular diseases; and among these , complications of hypertension account for approximately 9.4 million deaths. Hypertension, together with other health ri skfactors, is associated with highly detrimental complicatio ns including increased probability of heart attack, stroke and kidney disease as well as other chronic diseases. These risk factors include tobacco use, diabetes and hypercholesterol emia (World Health Organization, 2013 ). The consumption of herbs and mushrooms as dietary supplement has been known to be benecial to people with cardiovascular diseases ( Tan et al., 2016c). Owing to the rich content of dietary ber, mushrooms can help in cholesterol metabolism and absorption, thereby lowering the risk of cardiovascular diseases. There is also a growing interest in F. velutipes as an attractive source of various biologically active components including dietary b er, polysaccharides and mycosterol that have been long known to possesscholesterolandbloodpressureloweringeects( Yehetal., 2014).Infact, F.velutipes wasshowntocontainthehighestber content as compared as L. edodes , oystercapfungiandcapfungi( Yangetal.,2001 ). Yeh et al. (2014) investigated the eect of the active components of both F. velutipes powder and F. velutipes extract on the lipid metabolismof male hamsterson a diet. The LDL/HDL (high density lipoprotein cholesterol) in the serum and liver of the hamsters signicantly ( Yeh et al., 2014 ). This is in agreement with the ndings of another study whereby the exo-polymer of F. velutipes exerted hypolipidemic eect on diet-induced Signicant reduction n plasma triglyceride, plasma excretion and li ver LDLreceptormRNAlevelinrats( Fukushimaetal.,2001 ). Mushrooms are known to elicit hypocholesterolemia and also to possess anti-hypertensive properties. Chen et al. (2012)reported the detection of both lovastatin (12)and- aminobutyric acid Lovastatin (12)is used clinically for its inhibitory eect on cholesterol production, thereby reducing the risk of corona ry heart disease. Many studies have shown that food products containing GABA are able to lower the blood pressure of hypertensive subjects ( Aoki et al., 2003; Inoue et al., 2003; Hayakawa et al., 2004 ). Another study reported that the administration of GABA enriched F. velutipes powder (0.9mg GABA/kg)wassuccessfulinreducingthesystolicbloodpress ure by 30mmHg in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Of particular note, the study also reported that those with normal blood pressure were not aected by the powder ( Harada et al., 2011 ). These results were suggested to be due to GABA's eects on inhibiting noradrenaline release from the sympathetic nerv ous system, ameliorating the rise in blood pressure ( Hayakawa et al., 2002).

Flammulinavelutipes the use of the culture broth of F. velutipes as a source for ACE inhibitor provides many benets for the future development of anti-hypertensiveagentsthatareimportantforthetreatmen tfor cardiovasculardiseases( Kimetal.,2002 ). Memory and Learning Improvement Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative dis order characterized by the deterioration of cognition and memory . Studies have indicated that loss of basal forebrain choline rgic neurons involved in learning and memory processes constitut es a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease ( Martorana et al., 2010). Besides the cholinergic hypothesis, neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's disease, are also associat ed with oxidative damage in the brain resulting from an imbalance between reactive oxygen species generation and antioxidant enzyme activity ( Wong et al., 2012; Sayyad et al., 2016; Ser et al., 2016 ). Previous reports revealed that several mushrooms have been demonstrated to exhibit cognitive enhancing acti vity including sought to scopolamine induced learning and memory decits in rats ( Yang et al., 2015). The study revealed that the administration of FVP prevented the reduction of the antioxidant defense enzymes activities and elevation of TBARS levels caused by scopolamin e in the rats, showing that FVP improved the memory decits in the rats through amelioration of oxidative stress ( Gao et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2015 ). FVP was also found to restore the level of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) in th e hippocampus and cerebral cortex by modulating the activities of its synthetic enzyme, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and its hydrolysing enzyme, acetylcholinesterase (AChE). It a lso normalized the levels of other neurotransmitters includin g the serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, thereby reversing t he eect of scopolamine on the reduction of the neurotransmitter s (Yang et al., 2015 ). These neurotransmitters are known to be involved in both memory and learning functions ( Wang et al., 2013). In addition, FVP was also shown to prevent learning andmemoryimpairmentbyregulatingtheexpressionofprotein kinases, CaMK II and connexin 36 which plays a role in the synthesis and secretion of neurotransmitters ( Yang et al., 2015 ). Another study also demonstrated that the FVP extracted usin g ultrasonic methods displayed AChE inhibitory rate of 18.51% at 0.6mg/ml, suggesting FVP Ng et ).Wang Ng (2001) isolated an RIPdesignatedasvelutinfrom F.velutipes. Velutinwasshownto possess N-terminal sequence which resembles most other plantRIPs to a certain extent, however, its 10kDA molecular weight is much lower compared to the others, which mostly range from 25 to 30kDA ( Ng et al., reportedtoinhibittheactivityofHIVvirusreversetranscr iptase and also glycohydrolase, mainly - and -glucosidases which play a part in HIV infection ( Wang and Ng, 2001 ). Besides that, velutinwasalsonon-teratogenicwhentestedonmouseembryo s (Ngetal.,2010 ). Flammin and velin were the other two RIPs discovered from F. velutipes (Ng and Wang, 2004 ). Both of these RIPs do not show much resemblance in terms of N-terminal sequence to the published mushrooms RIPs, instead they show more similaritie s with angiosperm RIPs. Flammin and velin do not exhibit any RNase and protease activities. This lack of ribonuclease activity further conrms that the cell free translation-inh ibitory activity is attributed to ribosome inactivation and not the result of hydrolysis of RNA and protein ( Ng and Wang, 2004 ). Flammulina was another RIP found in the mushroom, and similar to flammin and velin, this protein is also found to be devoidofribonucleaseactivity( WangandNg,2000 ). Antioxidant Activities Reactive oxygen species (ROS) refers to free radicals derived from oxygen, including superoxide anion, nitric oxide, hydr oxyl radical and hydroxyl peroxide. ROS have important functions such as signaling and regulating the fundamental cellular processes of development such as cell death, oogenesis, spermatogenesis, angiogenesis and redox regulation of cells (Chan et al., 2015 ). However, excessive accumulation of ROS leads to conditions of oxidative stress which causes damage to lipid, DNA and protein, resulting in detrimental eects to the body (Covarrubias et al., 2008 ). Antioxidants are substances which can delay, prevent or reverse oxidative damage and are known to prevent several chronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes ( Karaman et al., 2010; Lau et al., 2015 ). Butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene are examples of potent synthetic antioxidants, however, some of them are foun d to be toxic and carcinogenic to human body, thus eorts are now focusing on discovering natural antioxidant product s (Moghadamtousi et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2015b; Tan et al., 2015a; Ser et al., 2016 ). Due to its various biological activities including the antioxidant properties, F. velutipes, as one of the most popular edible mushrooms, has attracted a considerable amount of attention in dierent elds including biochemistry andpharmacology( exhibit antioxidant activity ( Ma et al., 2015b; Xia, 2015 ). In recent decades, studies have reported high antioxidant activities shown by the dierent carbohydrate products derived from F. velutipes by using various extraction methods. Ma et al. (2015b)investigated the antioxidant capacity of the intracellular polysaccharides (IPS) extracted from F. velutipes mycelia. The study indicated rhamnose was the major component in IPS responsible for the strong antioxidant activity in vitroincluding the ability to scavenge hydroxyl and DPPH radicals ( Ma et al., 2015b). Besides, the study also showed IPS exhibited anti-aging Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org 16 December 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 474Tang et al. Flammulinavelutipes potential in which the anti-aging enzyme, superoxide dismuta se (SOD) in the blood, heart and kidney was increased following treatment with increasing concentrations of IPS ( Ma et al., 2015b). SOD protects cells from being damaged by superoxide anion radicals by converting them to hydrogen peroxide, a less active free radical ( Siu et al., 2013 ). In another study, exopolysaccharides (EPS) from F. velutipes were puried and characterized and it was found that the puried fractions wer e mainlycomposedofrhamnose( Maetal.,2015a ).Similarly,these EPS fractions were shown to exhibit potent antioxidant activ ity in vitrosuch as reducing power and capability of hydroxyl, and superoxide anions ( Ma al., 2015a ). This study also demonstrated the puried EPS fractions stimulate d anti-agingactivityinmiceasevidencedbytheincreasedca talase level and decreased malondialdehye content in the organs of the mice.At800mg/kgweight,whichwasthehighestdosageofEPS used in the experiment, catalase activity was the highest in h eart with10.12 \u00b10.05U/mgprotein.At800mg/kgdosageofEPS,the MDAcontentwastheleastinliver,0.62 \u00b10.03nmol/mgprotein which is 110% lower than the model control group treated with salineandd-galactose. Oligosaccharides derived from F. velutipes by hydrolysis using hydrogen peroxide also showed a strong hydroxyl radica l scavenging of 80.24% at the concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL (Xia, et al. (2014) extracted velutipes, exhibited superoxide radical IC 50value of about 10 mg/mL, hydroxyl radical scavenging ability with an IC 50value of about 12 mg/mL and reducing power of 1.04, showing a high antioxidant capacity. A t 200\u00b5g/mL,polysaccharidefromliquidculturemyceliaextracted using double distilled water, displayed DPPH scavenging rate of 65.85% and 71.24% ( Zhao etal.,2013 ). Variation in extraction methods may also influence the antioxidant properties of the polysaccharides derived from F. velutipes.Astudyshowedthatthepolysaccharidesof F.velutipes extracted using various extraction methods (conventional solvent extraction, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE ), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), enzymatic aqueous extraction (EAE)) were found to exhibit dierential antioxi activities in dierent in vitro assays. Crude polysaccharides (CFP) demonstrated the highest antioxidant activity in ter ms of reducing power, EAE polysaccharides (EFP) had the highest hydroxylradicalscavengingandmetalchelatingactivity, whereas UAE polysaccharides (UFP) had the highest DPPH scavenging activity. The researchers deduced that the molecular weigh t and chemical structure of the polysaccharides obtained from dierent extraction methods played a role in determining thei r antioxidant properties ( Zhang et al., 2013 ). UFP and MFP exhibited very much greater DPPH scavenging ability compare d to EFP and CFP; the high antioxidant capacity observed may be due to the further alteration of chemical structures and decomposition of polysaccharides caused by the ultrasonic an d microwavetreatments( Yangetal.,2008 ). Aside from polysaccharides, the phenolic compounds are also major naturally occurring antioxidant compounds in mushrooms ( Barros et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2008 ). The totalphenolic content in the mushrooms has a positive correlation with its antioxidant property measured by in vitroassays such assay and lipid peroxidation assay (Karaman et al., 2010 ).Zeng et al. (2012) demonstrated that F. velutipes possesses the highest phenolic content based on it having the highest antioxidant activities in terms of fer ric reducing antioxidant power and ferrous ion chelating activi ty amongthreeotherAustralianmushrooms.Incontrast, Karaman et al. (2009) found that F. velutipes has poorer phenolic content compared to other lignicolous fungi, suggesting tha t the prominent antioxidant activity may due to other secondar y biomolecules which had yet to be identied at the time of the study. Besides the fruiting body of F. velutipes , the spent culture medium of the mushroom was also shown to contain high amount of phenolic acids and show potent antioxidative action against lipid oxidation, demonstrating its role as a potential antioxidative agent ( Bao et al., 2010a ). For instance, p-coumaric acid (2), one of the hydroxycinnamic acids found in the mushroom, was shown to increase the activity of SOD and inhibited oxidative stress, resulting in reduction of c apoptosis in isoprenol-induced myocardial infarction Roy, ). Ellagic acid (3),which was detected in the fruiting bodies of F. velutipes , and is also presentinotherfruitsandnutssuchaspomegranateandwalnut s, was shown to be a potent antioxidant exhibiting DPPH radical and hydroxyl radical scavenging, chelatingactivities( Besides phenols and carbohydrates, a few other bioactive compounds present in F. velutipes were shown to exhibit antioxidant activity. Nucleotides derived from F. velutipes were reported to possess mild antioxidant activity. They showed reducing power value of 0.5 at 40 mg/mL and ABTS radical scavenging ability of 60% at 50 mg/mL ( Cheng et al., 2012 ). F. velutipes was reported to contain 46 mg/100g dry matter of vitamin C which is a well-known antioxidant ( Breene, 1990; Fu 30)extracted from solid cultureF. velutipes rice were demonstrated to haveDPPHradicalscavengingability( Wangetal.,2012d ). Recently, a study investigated the eect of selenium on the antioxidant activity of F. velutipes (Milovanovic et al., 2015 ). Selenium participates in the process of selenoproteins and selenoenzyme synthesis which work to protect cells from free radicals. The study demonstrated that selenium supplemented myceliumhadenhancedtotalphenolcontentandalsoenhanced DPPH radicals scavenging ability of the mushroom extract (Milovanovicetal.,2015 ). Interestingly, a study conducted by Zhang et al. (2013) demonstrated that the dierent varieties of F. velutipes possess dierent degrees of antioxidant activities. The investigat ion velutipes higher total phenolic and ergothionein e (34)(ESH) content compared to the other two. In term of their antioxidant activities, F3415 exhibited the stronge st DPPH radical scavenging ability and metal chelating ability, Fx uexiu showed the greatest reducing capability and FD had the most potenthydroxylradicalscavengingability.Meanwhile,Fyeh uang Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org 17 December 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 474Tang et al. Flammulinavelutipes displayedtheweakestantioxidantactivityamongthethreeo ther varieties ( Zhang et al., 2013 ). A linear relationship was observed between the phenolic acid and ESH content of the samples and their DPPH radical scavenging ability and reducing power . These ndings were concordant with those of Bao et al. (2009) which stated that high DPPH radical scavenging activity of t he mushroom was mainly attributed to its ESH content ( Bao et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2013 ). Furthermore, greater ESH level was associatedwithastrongerdelayinautoxidationofoxymyog lobin (Baoetal.,2010a;Chenetal.,2012 ). Based on these studies, it can be concluded that the strong antioxidant activity of F. velutipes is attributed to its various bioactive components, namely polysaccharides, pheno ls, rhamnosesugar,ESH,vitaminCandnucleotides.Dierentpart s ofF. velutipes including fruiting body, mycelium and even its spent culture medium are sources of potential antioxidants. Dierent extraction methods of polysaccharides yield extrac ts with varying antioxidant properties. Antioxidant ability of the mushroom extract also can be increased with the addition of selenium in the medium. Lastly, antioxidant capacity of F. velutipesvariesbetweendierentvarieties. Immunomodulatory Properties: Anti-Allergy, Anti-Viral and Anti-Complement Activity Recently, many studies have been done on medicinal plants in searchofcompoundsthatexhibitimmunomodulatoryproperties as it has been discovered that the modulation of the immune systemhelpstopreventdiseases.Thecurrentlyavailableche mical drugsusedasimmunomodulatorshaveshowntopossessahigher risk prole and Hatti-Kaul, 2013; Shukla et al., 2014 ). Mushrooms have been known for their medicinal value for decades, and many of the compounds extracted from mushrooms have been demonstrated to have modulatory eects on the immune system (Lee et al., 2011 ).F. velutipes is one of the medicinal mushrooms that exhibits immunomodulatory activities. Fun gal ImmunomodulatingProtein(FIP)isoneofthemaincompounds exhibiting immunomodulatory properties in F. velutipes . There was also evidence in a recombinant study expressing the recombinant FIP-fve cloned in the expression cassette vecto r pQE-30 in E. coliM15. The recombinant FIP-fve was shown to modulate dierent cytokine gene expression in mouse spleen cells, including the increased expression of IL-2, IL-4, IFN -, TNF-,LT,andIL-2R( Lietal.,2011 ). One of the earliest studies showed that oral administration of FIP extracted from F. velutipes (FIP-fve) induced Th-1 predominant allergen-specic immune response and protected the mice from anaphylaxis-like symptoms induced by oral challenge with ovalbumin (OVA) ( Hsieh et al., 2003 ). Therefore, Hsieh et al. (2003) proposed that FIP-fve can be developed as an immunoprophylactic agent against allergic diseases, showing potential to be used clinically in children for food allergy prevention. In the following year, it was found that FIP-fve exerted mitogenic eect on human peripheral blood lymphocytes, acting as a potent activator for lymphocyteproliferation ( Wang et al., 2004 ). The study demonstrated that the activated lymphocytes showed enhanced secretion of interferon- (IFN-) associated with ICAM-1 expression, both in vitroandin vivo. Furthermore, the study showed that the expression of IFN- in Th1 cells was regulated by p38 MAP kinase pathway in response to FIP-fve ( Wang et al., 2004 ). In addition, Ouetal.(2009) revealedtheIFN- productioninduced by FIP-fve in human peripheral mononuclear cells was also mediatedbytheCa2+releaseandPKC- activation. These ndings were then followed by several studies investigating the anti-allergic eect of FIP-fve against al lergen- inducedairwaydiseases( Hsiehetal.,2007;Leeetal.,2013 ).Hsieh et al. (2007) investigated the eect of FIP-fve on the survival of eosinophilsisolatedandpuriedfromallergicasthmaticpatie nts inthepresenceofIL-5.ThestudyindicatedthatFIP-fveindu ced apoptosis of eosinophils in the presence of IL-5 (which is a survival factor of eosinophils), thereby preventing eosinophi ls fromundergoingnecrosis.Eosinophilsareknowntoberelated to allergicdiseases,andapoptosisofeosinophils,withoutthere lease of their contents, is an important feature in the resolution o f inflammation. Furthermore, the study further claried that t he inhibition of the IL-5-mediated survival of eosinophils by FI P- fve was mediated through the upregulation of CD95 expression and the downregulation of BcL-xL and pro-caspase 3 expression (Hsieh et al., 2007 ).Lee et al. (2013) conducted an in vivo studythatutilizedanOVA-inducedchronicairwayinflammat ion murine model to evaluate the eect of FIP-fve against allergi c airway diseases. The study indicated that both pre-treatmen t and post-treatment with FIP-fve successfully suppressed airw ay inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. FIP-fve was shown to inhibit inflammatory cell inltration and Th2 cytokines, fur ther strengthening the view that FIP-fve possesses potential as a therapeutic agent for allergy related diseases ( Lee et al., 2013 ). Recent studies also demonstrated the anti-allergic eect of FI P- fve against dierent allergen-induced airway inflammation i n mice (Chang et al., 2015; Chu et al., 2015 ).Chu et al. (2015) showed oral administration of FIP-fve inhibited house dust mite (HDM)-induced asthma inflammation in mouse model via the modulation of Th1 cytokine production. Meanwhile, Chang et al. (2015) showed that intranasal application of FIP-fve reduced Dermatophagoides microceras inflammation and cytoki ne expressioninmice. Asidefromtheimmunomodulatorypropertiesagainstallergic diseases, Chang et al. (2014) showed that FIP-fve can be potentially used for viral prevention and therapy. The study revealedthatFIP-fvesuppressedairwayhyperresponsivenessa nd inflammation as the result of the downregulated IL-6 expressi on in mice infected by respiratory syncytial virus. Chang et al. (2014)also indicated that pre-treatment of FIP-fve did not prevent RSV infection but inhibited the replication of RSV through reduction in NF- B translocation and increased IFN- expression. Furthermore,FIP-fvewasshowntohavethepotentialtoserve as a novel therapeutic protective agent in preventing adverse eectsofcertaindrugs( Ouetal.,2015 ).Thisstudydemonstrated that FIP-fve reversed side eects of docetaxel\u2014an Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org 18 December 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 474Tang et al. Flammulinavelutipes anticancer ( 2015 ). FIP-fve was shown to signicantly reduce the adverse eects caused by docetaxel with fewer empty vacuoles in bone marrow, less small intestinal mucosa damage and decreased reduction of white blood cell counts in mice. Therefore, the study indica ted that FIP-fve showed protective eects against docetaxel-ind uced bone and intestinal damages and also enhanced WBC counts via induction of G-CSF and IL-20 gene expressions ( Ou et al., 2015). Apart from fungal immunomodulating protein, the polysaccharides extracted from F. velutipes are also known to exhibit immunomodulatory properties. Yin et al. (2010) isolated polysaccharides from F. velutipes mycelium which were showntoincreasenitricoxide(NO)production,IL-1producti on and TNF- production from macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. Another study showed that polysaccharides from F. velutipesmycorrhizae(PFVM)increasedthebodyweightofmice and the weight ratio of the thymus and spleen ( Yan et al., 2014 ). According to the study, the T cell subpopulation of thymocytes and splenocytes were modulated by the PFVM; CD3+, CD4+and CD4+/CD8+counts were increased while CD8+counts decreased in a dose dependent manner. Increasing dosage of PFVM resulted in increased levels of IL -2 and TNF- . However, IL-2 levels were highest when a medium dose was administered while TNF- was found to be highest when a high dose was administered. A separate study revealed that a water-soluble polysaccharide from F. velutipes also increased and lymphocyte proliferation was promoted (Wu et al., 2014 ). Similarly, the water extract of F. velutipes was also demonstrated to enhance splenocyte proliferation and Th1 cytokine production in mice ( Ryu et al., 2014 ). Another interesting study by Lee et al. (2011) showed that the boiling water mushroom F. velutipes extract ). The human complement system also participates in the host defense system in both innate and adaptive immunity to protect the body from foreign invading agents such as bacteria, fungi and viruses ( Carroll, 2004 ). Activation of the complement system can initiate a series of processes includin g opsonisation/phagocytosis, release of inflammatory mediato rs and the formation of the membrane attack complex, which subsequently leads to cell lysis. Under the normal physiologi cal state, the eects of the complement system activation are benecial to the host, but the excessive activation of the sy stem may cause undesirable adverse eects which then contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Therefore, the modulation of complement activity can be an important and useful tool in the eort to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatism and arthritis. Shin et al. (2007) investigated the anti-complement activity of seven dierent basidiomycetesextracts.Theinvestigationrevealedthat boththe hot water extracts and ethanol soluble fractions of F. veluitipes had the strongest anti-complement activity among the testedbasidiomycetes extracts, with IC 50of inhibitory activity toward totalhemolyticcomplementat47.1%and57.5%,respectively. Antimelanosis, Anti-Discoloration and Anti-Browning Properties There has been increased interest directed toward natural products with melanosis inhibiting properties because post- harvest melanosis occurring in seafood like crabs and shrim ps reduces the potential value of the seafood thus aecting the economy ( Encarnacion et al., 2011b this work ts ornaturalfoodanti-browningproduct( ).Several experiments showed that ergothioneine F. velutipes extract decreased polyphenoloxidase (PPO) activity whichcausesmelanosisindierentspeciesofshrimpsandcrabs in a dose-dependent manner ( Encarnacion et al., 2010, 2011a,b, 2012). Those studies also showed reduction in expression of prophenoloxidase (proPO) gene in the hemocytes of shrimps and crabs which had been submerged in ergothioneine- rich mushroom extract. Furthermore, the melanosis inhibit ion activity of the ergothioneine (34)from mushrooms was also demonstrated by the absence or reduction in blackening of th e carapace of the treated shrimps and crabs compared to the untreated group. Encarnacion et al. (2012) also suggested that ergothioneine (34)may be a non-competitive inhibitor which possiblyinteractsdirectlywithCu2+attheputativebindingsites ofpolyphenoloxidaseenzyme. The extracts of several mushrooms containing ergothionein e (34)were also shown to prevent brown discoloration in processed sh meat ( Bao et al., 2010b ). Brown discoloration occurs when both deoxymyoglobin and oxymyoglobin are oxidized into metmyoglobin (metMb). The study suggested tha t F. velutipes extract is able to suppress the formation of metMB. Moreover,tyrosinaseactivity,whichisinvolvedintheprodu ction of melanin, was shown to be inhibited by ethyl acetate extrac t ofF. velutipes mycelia grown in a specic medium containing 2% glucose ( Kim et al., 2011 ). These studies have demonstrated the potential application of F. velutipes extract as an eective natural a signicant global public healt h concern, particularly the emergence of multi-drugs resistan t strains of pathogens which have developed resistance toward almost all the available antibiotics ( Letchumanan et al., 2015a,b; Tan et al., 2016d ). As a result, there is an increasing push to search for bioactive compounds from natural sources to serve as alternative antimicrobials ( Tan et al., 2015b, 2016a; Azman et al., 2016; Chan et al., 2016 ) Reports on the occurrence of antimicrobials in F. velutipes mushroom are also well documented. The antimicrobial activities of extracts from dierent parts of F. velutipes have been the focus of several studies.Karaman et al. (2010) showed that both methanol and chloroform extracts from mature fruiting bodies of F. Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org 19 December 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 474Tang et al. Flammulinavelutipes velutipes exhibited strong antibacterial activities, particularly againstStaphylococcus aureus andBacillus subtilis . Similarly, the methanol extract of Macedonian wild F. velutipes fruiting body was demonstrated to show antibacterial activity again st both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including B. subtilis,Bacilluspumilus,S.aureus, andPseudomonasaeruginosa (Nedelkoska et al., 2013 ). Besides that, the antagonistic activity ofF. velutipes against plant pathogenic fungi was also examined byevaluatingthecompetitiveinteractionsofthemushrooma nd the pathogens in a dual culture in vitroexperiment ( Borhani et al., 2011 ). The study showed that after an initial deadlock, F. velutipes was able to completely replace Ophiostoma ulmi byF. velutipes been isolated from F. velutipes and are known to be major constituents responsible for F. velutipes antimicrobial activities. Four enokipodins A (35), B(22), C(36)and D (23)with known chemical structures have been isolated and puried from the mycelial culture of F. velutipes by a group of researchers ( Ishikawa et al., 2000, 2001 ). This group of compounds, enokipodins A-D (22, 23, 35, 36) were also successfully synthesized Srikrishna and Rao, It was reported that enokipodins A-D (22, 23, 35, 36) exhibited antibacterial activity mainly against the Gram-positive bacteria such as B. subtilisandS. aureus (Ishikawa et al., 2001, 2005; Saito and both enokipodins A C (36)demonstrated minimum inhibitory doses against B. subtilis LMA0011 comparable to those of penicillin G ( Ishikawa et al., 2005). A more recent study investigated the eect of culture conditions on the production and antimicrobial activity of t he antimicrobial metabolites of F. velutipes (De Melo et al., 2009 ). The study revealed that dextrose potato broth best supported mycelia growth while complete Pontecorvo's culture medium resulted in greater antimicrobial metabolite production by F. velutipes(DeMeloetal.,2009 ). In addition to the discovery of enokipodins A-D (22, 23, 35, 36), another research group from China isolated new cuparene- type sesquiterpenes from the solid culture of F. velutipes which also demonstrated antibacterial activities ( Wang et al., 2012b). The chemical structures of these sesquiterpenes were elucidatedandnamedasflamvelutpenoidsA-D (37to40).They were shown to exhibit antibacterial activity against E. coli, B. subtilisand methicillin-resistant S. aureus with MIC measuring more than 100 \u00b5M (Wang et al., 2012b ). Furthermore, Wang et al. (2012d) also revealed the isolation of six new cuparene sesquiterpenes,enokipodinsE-J (25to30)withantibacterialand antifungal activities. Enokipodins I (29)and J(30)were antibacterial activity against B. subtilis with MICs of 164.3\u00b16.2 and 151.2 \u00b14.5\u00b5M, respectively. Meanwhile, enokipodins F, G and I (26, 27, 29) exhibited antifungal studies have demonstrated the antimicrobial potential of F. velutipes as well as the bioactive compoundsresponsiblefortheascribedactivity,additional work to understand their mechanisms of action would need to be undertaken before proceeding to practical implementation of any of these compounds as nutraceuticals or drugs in the food andpharmaceuticalindustries. Anti-Inflammatory Inflammation is known to be a complex biological response to infection and tissue injury that ultimately leads to recove ry of tissuestructureandfunction.However,prolongedinflammat ion contributes to the development of many inflammatory diseases (Supriadyetal.,2015 ).Althoughmanysteroidalandnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been introduced for anti- inflammatory therapy, their prolonged use has been reported to pose serious adverse eects including signicant gastrointe stinal upset, gastritis, and Hazra, 2006 ). Therefore, much interest has been shown toward alternative anti-inflammmatory agents of plant origin as they appear to be naturalandsafedrugswhichposeminimal,ifany,adverseeect s (Supriady et al., 2015 ). A well-known medicinal mushroom, F. velutipes has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory activities. Gunawardena et al. (2014) revealed that unprocessed F. velutipes mushrooms possess anti-inflammatory properties, inhibiting the production of NO lipopolysaccharides and IFN-.Additionally,thestudyshowedthatmushroomsthathad undergone food processing steps such as boiling and heating showed less potent anti-inflammatory property, suggesting tha t theanti-inflammatorybioactivefactorsmayhavebeendegra ded in the processed mushroom. Another study showed that the water and ethanol extracts of F. velutipes exhibited strong nitric oxide inhibitory activity and Kang,2012 ). Hepatoprotective Activity Recently, a considerable number of studies have focused on the characterization of polysaccharides of mushrooms due to the ir protective action against hepatotoxicity ( Wu et al., 2011; Gan et al., 2012; Soares et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014 ).F. velutipes is amongthemushroomsdocumentedtohavepotentialinexerting protective eect toward hepatocytes. Pang et al. (2007) , an-(14)-d-glucan, a water polysaccharide (FVP2) from F. velutipes . The study indicatedthatFVP2enhancedthegrowthofprimaryhepatocyte s from mice in vitro signicantly at concentrations ranging from 25 to 200 \u00b5g/mL.Pang et al. (2007) demonstrated the Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org 20 December 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 474Tang et al. Flammulinavelutipes hepatoprotective eect of FVP2 was mediated preventing the production of CCl3radical caused by CCl 4, subsequently inhibiting lipid peroxidation and intracellularreleaseofALT( Pangetal.,2007 ). LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORKS The collective evidence presented in this review strongly suggests that F. velutipes should be exploited as a great source for development of functional foods, nutraceuticals and even pharmaceutical drugs. Despite that, there are still many challenges that need to be faced in order to facilitate the development of these natural products before they enter the pharmaceutical markets ( Wasser, 2011 ). One of them is that considerable eort is required to perform precise identicati on of specic bioactive molecules responsible for the bioactivi ty of the mushroom extracts. This provides a better understanding of the mechanism of action of each particular compound on the ascribed bioactivity. Furthermore, this also would add ress the issue of whether the bioactive eects are caused by a single component or are the result of a synergistic eect from several componentsintheextracts. There is also insucient quality control and regulatory protocols to guarantee a standardized extraction process and the eventual quality and ecacy of mushroom-derived natural products. For instance, some compounds such as polysaccharides,arehighlydiversiedinstructureandmol ecular weight (Jing et al., 2014 ); hence, it is challenging to maintain batch to batch quality. Without consistency in the quality of the mushroom-derived natural products, the composition and the eectiveness of any commercially available preparation of mushroom products would be highly variable and dierent. Hence, only proper standards and protocols can ensure the productquality.Moreover,itisalsoimportanttoestablishsi mple and reliable analytic techniques to assess the authenticit y or detect adulteration in mushrooms; preventing adverse eects attributed to adulteration. Apart from the use of gene marker s to authenticate F. velutipes (Su et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2010 ), a recent eort has shown that the analysis of IR spectroscopic ngerprints using principal component analysis is a reliable identication and qualication technique suitable for qua lity control of the polysaccharides extracted from F. velutipes (Jing etal.,2014 ). Even with the current knowledge on F. velutipes , there is still limited work assessing the bioavailability, pharmacokinet ics and pharmacodynamicsofthebioactivecompoundsisolatedfrom F. velutipes. A full understanding of the pharmacokinetic proles of the natural products from these mushrooms is required as it impacts their bioactivity after metabolism. For instan ce, information regarding the ability of a bioactive compound to be absorbed from the site of administration and to pass through several biological barriers are crucial for the compound to e xert its eect at the target site ( Chen et al., 2011 ). To date, therehave been abundant scientic investigations involving ext racts or compounds of this mushroom and their potential health promoting benets toward mankind, mainly on the basis of in vitroandinvivoanimaltrials.However,clinicalstudiesexploring thetherapeuticpotentialof F.velutipes areunfortunatelyveryfew innumber.Therefore,clinicaltrialsarehighlyneededtoa scertain the dosage, ecacy and safety of these compounds as adequate alternativestocurrentlyavailabledrugs. CONCLUSION An increasing awareness of the potential side eects of synthetic therapeutic agents and nutraceuticals has led to increased eorts to seek out natural products with benecial eects on health. Studies have shown that F. velutipes, an easily available mushroom, has excellent nutritional value and also remarkable potential applications for medicinal purposes. Nutritionally, F. velutipes is a good source for carbohydrates, proteins, unsaturated fatty acids, many val uable micronutrients and dietary ber which are highly comparable to vegetables. Although the nutritional values and culinar y uses ofF. velutipes are well documented, its medicinal qualities have yet to be. Bioactive polysaccharides extracted from F. velutipes have been demonstrated to possess a wide variety of bioactivities, particularly anticancer, immunomodulat ory and anti-neurodegenerative eects. However, the exact mode of action of these carbohydrates is still elusive and deserves special attention in future study. Extensive research has al so focused on a fungal immunomodulatory protein, FIP-fve isolated from F. velutipes, which exhibits both promising anticancer and immunomodulatory eects. The majority of the studies the FIP-fve elicits i ts immunomodulatory eects by shifting toward Th1 immune response. Apart from that, extracts of F. velutipes are also found to possess anticancer, anti-atherosclerotic, anti-thrombo tic, dened bioactive molecules from diverse chemic al groups have also been isolated from F. velutipes extracts that show invaluable prospects for future applications in the form of nutraceuticals/dietary supplements. In conclusion, F. velutipes has great potential as a nutraceutical and functional food, a s well as potentially representing a valuable source for bioact ive compounds therapeutic use and pharmaceutical application. The information presented in this review may also form the basis of providing adequate knowledge for future studies and developments as well as commercial exploitation of this fascinatingmushroom.
