Use cupping for headaches. Cupping leaves a round mark on the forehead. A cotton ball saturated in alcohol is placed in a glass and set on fire. After burning for a few seconds, the cotton is discarded. The heated glass is placed upside down over the painful area. Use coining for pain. Oil or ointment is applied to the skin. Then a large coin is used to rub the painful area in one direction until the blood is raised to just below the surface of the skin. This leaves red areas on the skin.

Discourage a menstruating woman from getting her head wet and from eating cucumbers, oranges, lemons, pork, lard, and deer meat. Chinese Use herbs as medicine. Practice acupuncture and use herbs over puncture sites. Use cupping with heated bamboo. Europeans Believe that illness is caused by outside sources.
