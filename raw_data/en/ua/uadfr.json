I hope that body wash to be released as soap is good but body wash is better.Priyanka27 Jun 2023 - \"Awesome oil..can see my hair\" Awesome oil..can see my hair growth within one month ..too good ????..thank u FE for this wonderful product..i wish it could improve the hair texture also as my hair r so dry and frizzyPARUL S27 Jun 2023 - \"Just awesome smell\" Just awesome smell. I loved it like anything. Now i am thinking of buying other variants as well. Anyone would love this fragrance and it lasts long. For whole 10 hours in the office i would definitely suggest to buy this and its easy to carry while travellingPRAKASHINI M.27 Jun 2023 - \"Shampoo is superb.\" It's a great product and i have been using it since long. I wish you have this product in a bigger sized packaging. It smells so good and refreshing. My hair growth has been improved. Thank you ????Reena S.26 Jun 2023 - \"I've been using the Saffron\" I've been using the Saffron cleanser for almost 10 years every single day. I have an auto immune condition due to which my skin is very delicate. This is the only product that suits my skin no matter the weather.Priya A.26 Jun 2023 - \"Beautifully balanced\" Given that rose and cardamom can both be sweet smelling, I was a little anxious about this order. Boy, was I wrong! The scent is beautifully balanced and the cardamom lends it a heady spiciness, which is quite unexpected (at least, it was for me!). Love it.Shriyansi S.25 Jun 2023 - \"Absolutely love this product\" Feels luxurious and yes I felt my skin looked much better the very next day!!Nina N.25 Jun 2023 - \"This is the best spf\" This is the best spf sunscreen liquid. Gives a smooth and soft texture on skin as well as on hands. Loved this product.Nancy S.24 Jun 2023 - \"Love love it!\" I recently ordered a bunch of products from forest essentials. I live in the US and in a city where it is rains and the temperatures are cooler round the year. My skin is dry and prone to frequent break outs. But man the products from forest essentials are magic. I use Sandalwood & Orange Peel moisturizer during day time and my skin has started glowing. It is not oily and doesn't provide moisturizing for long. But I pair it with a moisturizing serum so it works perfectly. The products are really high quality, clean and organic as compared to some of the other high end products that one gets in the US!Ruhi23 Jun 2023 Recent awards Renowned for winning accolades and garnering features in prominent national and international publications, our products are preferred and loved by industry experts and celebrities.
