It's the process of unlearning deeply held myths and relearning the direct experience of openness. Why can meditation be such a challenge? It can seem at first to be a difficult task because in our modern day we are inundated with a vast array of distractions and have been taught that a life of \"busyness\" translates to success. However, meditation reminds us that there may be some holes in the logic of busyness and materialistic culture. Meditation is simply allowing ourselves to be and being present for whatever comes up. It does not matter if we have great thoughts, horrible thoughts, boring thought or anything in between. Thoughts are simply the expressive energy that has not manifested in the material world yet.They are a ceaseless flow and there is no stopping them. You may have a million thoughts in ten minutes but that is okay. We come back. What this coming back does is that it allows you to slowly and realistically relax with ourselves thus becoming present to our life. When we simply sit, we become aware of the momentum of our thoughts and emotions. Whenever we attach to one of these thoughts or emotions, we can simply see it for what it is, a thought, and bring our attention back to just being. Meditation allows you to see your patterns for what they are. This can be an extremely important tool in life. It gives you space, and a gap. What lies within this gap? The void, the recognition of the void that is always present, the one that you are always trying to fill up. It's uncomfortable for most of us but it is the ground in which all things are possible, all new ways of being. It's a fresh start that you can live in. It's salvation in regards to being a slave to your habitual tendencies. Not to say it's easy or that by sitting 5-10 minutes a day all of your problems will go away. But by doing it you will begin to glimpse the possibility of doing things differently. Today, we invite you to try a simple meditation practice. It is called Shamatha-Vipashyana. Try implementing this exercise into your daily life 5-10 min a day. Meditation Instruction The focus of this meditation will be on your natural breath so simply pay attention to the sensation of the breath coming in and out. Breathe naturally. Simply focus on that. When a thought, feeling or emotion comes up the main practice is simply to label it \"thinking\" and come back to the breath. As we talked about earlier it does not matter if it is a good thought, a bad thought, an important thought, or whatever, they all are equally just a thought You simply come back over and over again. Be Awake, Present, and Relaxed. Relax and enjoy just being, this is a gift that you can give yourself, and it is truly one of the rarest and most truly precious gifts. Remember that if you find it challenging that is natural and with time it does get easier. After you have finished a session of meditation feel free to drop the technique and simply sit in the natural presence of the world around you. "}
