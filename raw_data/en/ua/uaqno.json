This provision is Section 427 of GEPA, enacted as part of the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (Public Law (P.L.) 103-382). To Whom Does This Provision Apply? Section 427 of GEPA affects applicants for new grant awards under this program. ALL APPLICANTS FOR NEW AWARDS MUST INCLUDE INFORMATION IN THEIR APPLICATIONS TO ADDRESS THIS NEW PROVISION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE FUNDING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. (If this program is a State-formula grant program, a State needs to provide this description only for projects or activities that it carries out with funds reserved for State-level uses. In addition, local school districts or other eligible applicants that apply to the State for funding need to provide this description in their applications to the State for funding. The State would be responsible for ensuring that the school district or other local entity has submitted a sufficient section 427 statement as described below.) What Does This Provision Require? Section 427 requires each applicant for funds (other than an individual person) to include in its application a description of the steps the applicant proposes to take to ensure equitable access to, and participation in, its Federally-assisted program for students, teachers, and other program beneficiaries with special needs. This provision allows applicants discretion in developing the required description. The statute highlights six types of barriers that can impede equitable access or participation: gender, race, national origin, color, disability, or age. Based on local circumstances, you should determine whether these or other barriers may prevent your students, teachers, etc. from such access or participation in, the Federally-funded project or activity. The description in your application of steps to be taken to overcome these barriers need not be lengthy; you may provide a clear and succinct description of how you plan to address those barriers that are applicable to your circumstances. In addition, the information may be provided in a single narrative, or, if appropriate, maybe discussed in connection with related topics in the application. Section 427 is not intended to duplicate the requirements of civil rights statutes, but rather to ensure that, in designing their projects, applicants for Federal funds address equity concerns that may affect the ability of certain potential beneficiaries to fully participate in the project and to achieve to high standards. Consistent with program requirements and its approved application, an applicant may use the Federal funds awarded to it to eliminate barriers it identifies. What are Examples of How an Applicant Might Satisfy the Requirement of This Provision? The following examples may help illustrate how an applicant may comply with Section 427. (1) An applicant that proposes to carry out an adult literacy project serving, among others, adults with limited English proficiency, might describe in its application how it intends to distribute a brochure about the proposed project to such potential participants in their native language. (2) An applicant that proposes to develop instructional materials for classroom use might describe how it will make the materials available on audio tape or in braille for students who are blind. (3) An applicant that proposes to carry out a model science program for secondary students and is concerned that girls may be less likely than boys to enroll in the course, might indicate how it intends to conduct \"outreach\" efforts to girls, to encourage their enrollment. We recognize that many applicants may already be implementing effective steps to ensure equity of access and participation in their grant programs, and we appreciate your cooperation in responding to the requirements of this provision.

So, when COVID -19 came in as a sledgehammer, imposing an incredible burden to State's citizens , Ohioans stepped up. It is with this backdrop that Ohio responds to Absolute Priority 3 of the ESF-REM Discretionary Grants Program . Ohio's project goal: To coordinate, integrate, replicate and scale Ohio's innovative field -initiated student learning and remote education exemplars to significantly increase student access to transformative remot e caring, teaching and learning opportunities; promote the continuity and fluency of learning; improve student outcomes and close the State's equity gap. Ohio requests $ over 36 months to execute its five-point plan: 1) Launch RemotEDx, an organized marketplace that connects educators and schools to innovative field- initiated student learning and remote education exemplars to exchange ideas, integrate concepts and transform remote education offerings; 2) Establish a companion RemotEDx Network and Coordinating Council to inform policies and practices and enhance partnerships; 3) Deploy a RemotEDx Support Squad to facilitate model selection and implementation and assist with job - embedded professional learning in support of remote education; 4) Dep loy RemotEDx Connectivity Crusaders who help schools meet technology and internet needs of students; and 5) Establish formal feedback loops so RemotEDx drives improvement across Ohio's education community. Partners include INFOhio, Educational Service Centers , Information Technology Centers, Ohio Distance Learning Association, Ohio STEM Learning Network, Ohio PTA, Teaching Institute for Excellence in STEM and Ohio's internet -based schools. Possible examples of innovative field-initiated student learning exemplars include Remote Learning Alliance, StartSole and Bonds of Union.

Ohio adopted a \"Stay at Home\" order in mid -March and closed all school buildings to slow the infection rate. While the State's coronavirus burden, based on the factors used by the U.S. Department of Education, appears relatively low at the 4 1st to 60th percentile (Selection Criteria (A)(1)), a troubling scenario lies beneath the surface. To understand the significance of the impact of COVID -19 on Ohio's students, parents and schools, one also must understand the underlying conditions that have been exacerbated by the pandemic (Selection Criteria (A)(2)). M AGNIFIED IMPACT ON URBAN SETTINGS The impact of COVID -19 has been magnified in Ohio's urban centers where social and economic hardships increase the risk of suffering from COVID-19. Five of Ohio's 88 counties,1 those containing Ohio's five largest cities, account for roughly half of all COVID-19 cases in Ohio. Ohio's minority populations are concentrated in urban areas, placing these individuals at a heightened risk for COVID-19. As of May 20, 2020, Black Ohioans, who comprise 14% of Ohio's overall population, made up 25% of COVID-19 cases. Latinos, who comprise 3.9% of Ohio's population, made up 6% of COVID-19 cases. 2 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS EXACERBATED BY COVID -19 Ohio's high coronavirus burden is readily apparent when viewed through the lens of the State's significant social and economic hardships. Prior to COVID-19, t hese stressors were PR/Award # S425B200035 Page TIN: 31 -1334820 ) 2 already affecting the lives of man y students across the State. Health: Prior to COVID-19, Ohio's population faced massive challenges related to health and wellbeing. The pandemic o nly exacerbate d those challenges. Opioid crisis - In 2018, Ohio had the 4th highest number of overdose deaths of any state (3,980 deaths) and had the 5th highest drug overdose rate at 36 deaths per 100,000 people.3 Infant mortality - In 2018, Ohio was tied with Tennessee for the 9th highest infant mortality rate at 7 deaths per 1,000 live births.4 As of 2017, Ohio had the 2nd highest infant mortality rate at 14.5 per 1,000 live births among non-Hispanic Black persons.5 Mental health - In 2019, one-quarter (25.1%) of Ohio's school-age Medicaid population had been diagnosed with a primary behavioral health or mental health challenge. Unemployment: COVID-19's effect on Ohio's economy has been staggering, resulting in unprecedented levels of unemployment. In the five urban counties noted above, increases in unemployment claims since March range from a low of over 400% to a high of more than 1,200% over claims from 2019.6 In the final week of April 2020, nearly a million Ohioans filed unemployment claims; (a 1,500% increase over April 2019 and the 6th worst unemployment rate of any state at 16.8%).7, 8 Ohio's economy relies on industries that were hard-hit by COVID-19. Jobs in the construction and service industries, for example, saw a 13-percentage point drop between 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. 9 Ohio's unemployment rate continues to rise faster than other states . From April 2019 to April 2020, Ohio had the 8th highest unemployment increase (12.7 percentage points). PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e17 Ohio ) 3 Natural Disaster: Even the weather conspired to compound the effects of COVID-19 on Ohioans. On March 20, in two central and southern Ohio counties, a period of intense flooding resulted in mass evacuations by SWAT teams . Waters rising to six feet deep in some areas result ed in families having to shelter together amid confirmed COVID -19 community spread.10 Children in Need: Ohio's unemployment and health challenges contribute to increased poverty and other adverse childhood experiences (ACE). Census estimates indicate that 17 .4% of Ohio children aged 5-17 live in poverty. Among school-age children, Ohio has the 8th highest rate (39.1%) of Black children living in poverty.11 Medicaid enrollment serves as an alternative measure of poverty. Half of Ohio's school-age children (48.7%) are Medicaid enrolled. Between February 2020 and May 2020, Medicaid enrollment increased by 6%, a rate 20 times greater than the period from December 2019 to February 2020. More than 160,000 Ohioans enrolled in Medicaid in that period, with children ages 5 -18 making up one-quarter of new enrollees. As of May 2020, nearly one-quarter (24.2%) of Ohio's public-school students were in families that received Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits . Nearly half (46.6%) of Ohio's non- Hispanic Black students received these supports. 12 On March 12, 2020, Ohio became one of the first states to announce a statewide K -12 school-building closure , affecting1.7 million students - 77% of whom are at-risk in a remote learning environment, either because they are vulnerable youth (i.e., students with disabilities, English learners, migrant, homeless, justice involved, foster care, milit ary), or because they have limited internet connectivity. Data from the American Community Survey (ACS 2018) indicates that 11.8% of Ohioans are PR/Award # S425B200035 Page TIN: 31 -1334820 ) 4 without broadband access ; however, district specific estimates reveal wide disparities in access. As many as1 8.8% of children in high-poverty districts and 19.5% of children in Ohio's rural districts have no broadband access.13 In an Ohio Department of Education issued statewide survey to understand challenges schools faced in remote learning in spring 2020, over half i ndicated that providing services to special student populations was among the top three challenges. For example: o Educators struggled to provide Ohio's students with disabilities (16% of students) services close to the manner prescribed in their individualized education programs. o Since 2009, the percentage of Ohio's preK-12 students expe riencing homeless ness has tripled . Before COVID-19, Ohio had more than 25,000 homeless students. In spring 2020, Ohio educators cited concerns about staying in contact with homeless and mobile stude nts, as well as concerns about those students' safety and well being. o Almost 20,000 Ohio students are in foster care and more than 15% of students in Ohio's largest urban districts change districts at least once during the school year. These s tudents often require educational and whole child supports that are challenging to deliver in a remote environment. A dditionally, it is more difficult to assess safety and detect signs of child abuse and neglect in remote learning environments. Since March 2020, reports of child abuse and neglect declined by nearly 50% in Ohio. O HIO'S ASSETS AND COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS TO SUPPORT STUDENTS (Application Requirement (4)(a)) Ohio and its schools responded to the pandemic by taking swift action to address the increased needs o f students and families. Addressing Needs Through LEAs: At the time of the school-building closure, the Ohio PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e19 Ohio ESF-REM 809174378 ; TIN: 31 -1334820 ) 5 Department of Education worked aggressively to support LEAs by issuing more than 25 information documents on the entire range of caring student supports, including child nutrition, student safety and supports for vulnerable youth. Ohio issued a Remote Learning R esource Guide with information on remote education efforts and instructional supports. The State enacted legislation supporting schools' continued operation. Federal CARES Act funds allowed districts to cover additional costs incurred in meeting student's n eeds. The State also worked with its philanthropic community to establish the \"Collaborative Fund for Educating Re motely and Transforming Ohio 's Schools. \" Through his public-private initiative, which will be coordi nated with RemotEDx , the S tate will use CARES A ct funds to match priv ate support to help schools implement remote education . Parent and Student Supports: Ohio's efforts focused on supporting the needs of students and families including a massive, coordinated effort to continue food services. The State took advantage of federal waivers to expand service, allow multiple mod es of food delivery and send Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card s to families. Additionally, upon noticing a decline in referrals to local Children's Services Agencies, Ohio issued guidance for educators and volunteers to assist in identifying potential instances of child abuse and neglect. Collaboration with State Agency Partners: Ohio's efforts were aided by strong relationships among S tate agencies , for example : The Ohio Department of Job and Family Services support ed pandemic- level child -care and pre-school services for essential health workers and efforts to increase students' access to food services. The Ohio Department of Mental Health coordinated guidance on supporting students' behavioral and mental health, as well as direction on building community partnerships. PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e20 Ohio TIN: 31 -1334820 ) 6 The Ohio Department of Health kept schools apprised of COVID-19 developments and necessary health precautions. The State's Emergency Operations Center facilitated the sharing of resources and services. For example, Ohio's Career Technical Education Centers donated thousands of boxes of personal protective equipment to the State's health care providers. Ohio also leveraged partnerships with stakeholders including the Ohio Educational Service Center Association and the Management Council of Ohio Education Computer Network (MCOECN). As a result, i nternet and cell -phone providers made available no- and low-cost service for students who were without access, and many schools received donations of iPads and other devices, which they distributed to families in need. B ARRIERS FACED BY THE STATE (Application Requirement (4)(b)) Ohio faces many barriers to meeting the needs of its students, including the magnified impact of COVID-19 in urban settings and for vulnerable populations; pre-existing social and economic hardships exacerbated by COVID-19; and pe rsistent health issues. Behind each of these barriers are the broad truths that COVID-19 exacerbated long-standing equity issues and Ohio's schools were (and still are) at varying points of readiness for successfully planning and implementing high -quality remote caring, teaching and learning. QUALITY OF PROJECT SERVICES AND PROJECT PLAN (Selection Criteria B) Ohio is excited to introduce its RemotEDx Platform , an exchange, network and suite of innovative field -initiated student learning and remote education exemplars and supports, which seeks to provide more students with high- quality remote education opportunities that are personalized to meet their individual needs. Ohio's RemotEDx project responds to Absolute PR/Award # S425B200035 3 \u2014Field -Initiated Projects for Educational Models for Remote Learning to Improve Student Outcomes . The State's proposal has been systematically co -designed by a cross-sector team ( See Attachment A for a full listing ) focused on meeting the educational needs of at-risk students. At-risk students14 comprise 77% of Ohio's student population - a population (see Ohio 's High Coronavirus Burden) that was significantly af fected by COVID-19 and stands to benefit most from the coordination, integration, replication and scaling of innovative field - initiated student learning and remote education exemplars. In the near term, RemotEDx will transform remote caring, teaching and learning opportunities for students. In the long term, it will help reengineer broader education delivery. This project intentionally uses the term remote education , and defines it as approaches for delivering caring, teaching and learning opportunities seamlessly to students outside of a school building. Each Child, Our Future , Ohio's five -year strategic plan for education (adopted in June 2018), uses the term caring to describe how parents, caregivers and community members work together to meet the needs of the whole child, including physical, social, emotional and intellectual needs. The State's strategi c plan defines \" whole child supports\" as actions taken to ensure that each child, in each school, in each community, is healthy, safe, engaged, supported and challenged. Use of the word caring as a component of remote education emphasizes the importance of whole child supports, especially when it comes to serving the State's most at -risk students. This project is anchored to Ohio's strategic plan, which also articulates a statewide vision and goal for student success and prioritizes equity in education. RemotEDx seizes a rare opportunity to re-imagine education based on disruptions resulting from COVID-19. During the pandemic, Ohio's leading policymakers, educators, businesses, philanthropists and parents discussed pursuing a new direction\u2014not one that seeks to PR/Award # S425B200035 Page ) to the \"normal\" that existed prior to coronavirus, but rather, a re-imagined direction informed by lessons learned after three months of unplanned statewide remote learning. Ohio's pre-pandemic \"normal\" perpetuated equity issues, which have been evident since the S tate started disaggregating student performance data (if not before). This is an opportunity to use remote education as a catalyst for transformation \u2014not as a short-term fix for a school-building closure or to promote a s eries of standalone online courses that are injected into a traditional approach. The time is right for Ohio to begin reengineering its education model so that learning can become the constant and time and place can become the variables. In this way each student can engage and learn physically in the classroom one day, and seamlessly at home or in the workplace or laboratory the next day. It would allow educators to confidently and fluently shift from one teaching mode to another because of high-quality tr aining and the interoperability of systems and tools. Finally, it would provide each student the benefit of caring adults who offer an array of supports\u2014from behavioral, mental and physical healthcare to career counseling \u2014 either in person or virtually. Ohi o's new direction strives to be multifaceted and multilayered. RemotEDx also comes on the heels of Ohio's recently enacted legislation (H.B. 164), which permits each school and district to adopt a plan to provide instruction using a remote education model for the 2020-2021 school year. Each plan must include all of the following: (1) A description of how student instructional needs will be determined and documented; (2) The method to be used for determining competency, granting credit and promoting students to a higher grade level; (3) The school's attendance requirements, including how the school will document participation in learning opportunities; (4) A statement describing how student progress will be monitored; (5) A description as to how equita ble access to quality instruction PR/Award # S425B200035 Page Ohio ) 9 will be ensured; (6) A description of the professional development activities that will be offered to teachers. Supporting these plans is a key objective of Ohio's proposed project. PROJECT APPROACH (Selection Criteria ( B)(1) & Application Requirement (1)) Ohio's goal for RemotEDx: To coordinate, integrate, replicate and scale innovative Ohio's field -initiated student learning and remote education exemplars to significantly increase student access to transformative remote education opportunities; promote the continuity and fluency of learning; improve student outcomes and close the State's equity gap. The function of RemotEDx is to serve as a learning exchange and network platform for innovative field -initiated student learning and remote education exemplars that meet a set of rigorous quality criteria. The notion is simple: gather Ohio's exemplars and organize, coordinate and integrate them to achieve highly effective approaches to remote education for Ohio's most at-risk students. By working together, learning from each other, sharing expertise and co- designing a coherent direction, Ohio's innovative field -initiated student l earning and remote education exemplars can achieve greater impact, serve more students and, over time, transform Ohio's education system. Ohio's logic model (Figure 1) identifies the needs and inputs used to help inform the design of RemotEDx. These needs are explained in greater detail in Ohio 's High Coronavirus Burden and below. The inputs represent the assets and partners Ohio will leverage to operationalize RemotEDx. The strategies are the component parts of the RemotEDx Platform and are explained in greater detail below. The short-term outcomes describe the results Ohio expects to realize one year after initiating the project. The long -term outcomes speak to transformative changes the State expects to experience after three years. PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e24 Ohio CT STRATEGIES To achieve its goal and improve remote education opportunities for Ohio's most at-risk students, the full RemotEDx Platform offers the following component parts and integrated strategies described below. (Note that the implementation plan and timeline for key grant activities and the plan for how Ohio will assess the number of students served is described in the Management Plan section (Selection Criteria (C) beginning at page 22.) 1. RemoteEDx Exchange: The RemotEDx Exchange (the Exchange) is where schools and educators go to connect with selected field -initiated student learning and remote education exemplars and providers . Exemplars and providers are admitted into the exchange after meeting a set of rigorous criteria that ensures a high -quality and transformational approach to remote education. The Exchange imprimatur signals a high - level of program integration and quality. Ohio's sc hools can select from among the exemplars from the Exchange and will benefit from implementation and technical supports offered through the RemotEDx. Priority access and support will be granted to schools and districts that have the greatest remote education needs or serve the highest percentage of at -risk students. The Exchange will be managed by INFOhio (see brief description in narrative below and a more detailed description in the Attachment B) in partnership with the Ohio Department of Education. 2. RemotEDx Network and Learning Academy: Users of RemotEDx will be invited to become members of a peer -to-peer learning Network (the Network). The purpose of the Network is to inform policy and practice, create consistency and share new knowledge and best practices across exemplars, partners, schools and experts who share the goal of integrating remote education models and replicati ng and scaling them for impact. The PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e26 Ohio TIN: 31 -1334820 ) 12 Network will be managed collectively by the Support Squad described below. The Support Squad and Network will also host webinars and regular \"hang outs\" designed explicitly to support successful integration of remote education strategies and approaches into the educational experience of schools and districts. Additionally, the RemotEDx Learning Academy will be an annual sharing and learning opportunity for Network members and others focused on improving access to and success of remote education. 3. RemotEDx Connectivity Crusaders: This dedicated team of individuals will be empowered to remove barriers that get in the way of internet connectivity. During Ohio's school-building closure, Ohio's individual schools deployed a wide range of strategies to address connectivity deficiencies. These included the purchase of hot -spots, installation of service by internet providers and cable companies through school districts or directly to families, the use of school buses as hot spots and schools that pointed routers and network extenders to parking lots to enable student use outside the school building. The regionally deployed Crusaders will be charged with aggressively support schools and districts in closing the connectivity gap. They will accomplish this by connecting to broader S tate efforts and, in some cases, interfacing with internet, cable and cell phone providers. 4. RemotEDx Support Squad: The Support Squad will include a concierge team dedicated to matching schools to field -initiated student learning and remote education exemplars and vice versa. The concierge greets the school upon arrival into the Exchange and helps manage the experience. Once s chool s beg in to implement field -initiated student learning and remote education exemplars, they will receive deeper technical assistance from the Support Squad. The Squad will help in the identification, selection, integration and PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e27 Ohio of high -quality remo te education strategies across the S tate. Each Support Squad member will be trained to have a deep understanding of the quality remote education tools and field -initiated exemplars that are part of the Exchange. They also will be well versed in options that wo rk in different settings and that meet differing needs. 5. RemotEDx Coordinating Council: The RemotEDx Platform will be guided by the Coordinating (the Council). The Council will consist of representatives from t he Ohio Department of Education, INFOhio, ESCs, ITCs and the Remote Learning Alliance, along with representatives from innovative field -initiated student learning exemplars and remote education models that are a part of RemotEDx. It also will include the \"voice of parents,\" organized by the Ohio PTA, and a subcommittee representing the \" voice of students.\" Connectivity Crusaders and Support Squad representatives will be linked informally to the Council to ensure coherence. The Council will be the guardian o f quality for the Exchange and will promote integrated models and eschew off-the-shelf models. It will be staffed and facilitated by a recognized education organization that will cross coordinate with the Ohio Department of Education and INFOhio. See a fuller description of the Council's composition and responsibilities in the Management Plan section of this proposal. 6. Promising Models and Feedback Loops : Through this project, Ohio is committed to generating and receiving feedback and analyzing which innovative field-initiated student learning and remote education exemplars are achieving the most significant student outcomes. The Ohio Department of Education will also establish formal feedback loops that connect it to RemotEDx to inform its work and drive continuous improvement and broader transformation. PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e28 Ohio TIN: 31 ) 14 REMOTE EDUCATION SUPPORT PARTNERS Following are Ohio's existing remote education support partners, which each serve an important purpose in Ohio's remote education ecosystem. These entities will play a role in the RemotEDx Platform. Ohio's students, particularly its most at -risk, will bene fit from increased RemotEDx-driven statewide coordination, coherence and expansion. INFOhio : INFOhio is a program of The Management Council of the Ohio Educational Computer Network that curates and licenses qu ality, standards-aligned digital curriculum materials and instructional resources to support remote, blended and hybrid teaching and learning. It curates and licenses standards -aligned digital content; builds and supports online learning platforms; delivers technical and instructional support; and provides professional development opportunities. INFOhio works with content providers and ITCs to establish and enable authentication methods that ensure anytime access from any Internet- connected device in the classroom, at home, or on the go. Educational Service Centers (ESCs) : Ohio has 51 regional ESCs whose primary services include curriculum and instructional support and development, school improvement, professional development, special education services [including a statutory partnership with the Ohio Center for Autism and Low Incidence (OCALI)], preschool support and the implementation of statewide mandated initiatives. All 51 ESCs currently provide remote learning professional development to educators; 89% of the ESCs provide teletherapy for students ; 57% provide online instruction specially designed for students with disabilities ; and 47% provide a full online curriculum option for client schools. Remote Learning Alliance: Newly developed, the Remote Learning Alliance (RLA) is a group of educational organizations committed to helping make the transition to remote PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e29 Ohio TIN: 31 -1334820 ) 15 learning as easy and robust as possible for Ohio educators. It helps schools, educators and students operationalize remote and/or blended learning education plans; serves as a hub for school districts to scale learning opportunities, resource sharing and supports; partners with remote learning experts and platforms to help support schools; and connects students to broadband and technology devices for remote learning. It also offers professional development and training to schools and districts. Information Technology Centers (ITCs) and the Management Council of the Ohio Education Computer Network: The Ohio Education Computer Network is comprised of 18 ITCs that focus on technology infrastructure, data collection and supporting schools with administrative and educational technologies . ITCs are coordinated by the Management Council . ITCs provide fiscal services, student information system supports, digital resources , internet connectivity and data collection to over 600 school districts. ITCs often leverage INFOhio 's digital resources and training ; ESC's curriculum and instructional expertise ; and vendors' academic content to provide technology devices, internet services and remote learning resources to at-risk students. Ohio Distance Learning Association: The Ohio Distance Learning Association (ODLA) promotes and fosters partnerships among schools and affiliates to effectively use distance learning. ODLA members have created exceptional programs such as daily classes that expand opportunities in K -12 schools, including college credit and relevant professional development and outreach activities for schools and educators. In response to Ohio's ordered-school building closure , ODLA expanded its live, two -way videoconferencing medium to enable school districts to mainta in or expand virtual courses and provide remedial and advanced opportunities to students. Its expanded PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e30 Ohio TIN: ) 16 initiatives include virtual after -school programs to support at-risk students who are ill or who cannot fully participate in remote learning. PROSPECTIVE INNOVATIVE FIELD -INITIATED STUDENT LEARNING EXEMPLARS & PARTNERS Following are prospective inno vative field -initiated student learning ex emplars and partners that will likely engage interact with Remot EDx. These examples demonstrate a unique approach to providing to supporting remote education through a comprehensive delivery method coupled with an integrated approach. Ohio STEM Learning Network: The Ohio STEM Learning Network manages a series of regional STEM hubs and STEM schools that offer integrated STEM education opportunities for students\u2014leveraging a virtual platform approach . The network helps schools and communities create innovative STEM schools and programs; connect s innovative schools, teachers and administrators to one another and to S tate and national resources; and manag es the statewide STEM schools designation process. StartSOLE (Self Organized Learning Environments): StartSOLE began by creating a technology platform for teachers to seamlessly integrate problem-based learning (PBL) and inquiry into their existing classrooms. One -third of Ohio's teachers now use StartSOLE, reaching more than 100,000 students. StartSOLE is a platform that delivers complex process technologies directly to students by enabling the facilitation aspects to be integrated into the classroom or virtual experience. Participating teachers are connect ed to a larger community that offers immediate value ( such as automated lesson plans) and it is free of charge. When Ohio's ordered school-building closure was announced, StartSOLE quickly designed and launched a virtual version of its application . PR/Award # S425B200035 Page TIN: 31 ) 17 Teaching Institute for Excellence in STEM (TIES): TIES provides school design and re-design services; offers education leadership coaching and professional development for educators; and address es equity, health, safety and remote learning issues. TIES also delivers a range of professional development services for formal and informal educators. Using the power of STEM to drive social mobility and equity, TIES also supports under- represented students by creating connected and workforce-aligned opportunities. Bonds of Union: Bonds of Union, along with its current pilot initiative known as Ascend, aims to transform the delivery of instruction and improve academic and social - emotional outcomes for the lowest performing students in urban school settings . In the 2019-2020 school year, Ascend served students in grade s 4-6 at Bond Hill Academy Elementary School. Over the course of one school year, 100% of students in Ascend's 4th grade cohort went from scoring in the bottom two tiers in math (\"limited\" and \"basic\") to achieving grade-level proficiency on S tate standardized testing \u2014as compared to only 50% of non-Ascend students who started in the same low -scoring group. Ascend is the first initiative of its kind to deliver individualized, 1:1 mathematics and social -emotional learning curriculum that is specifically tailored to meet the needs of low -performing students through immersive, remote learning stations within the school bui lding and community -based institutions. More detailed information about each of these innovative field -initiated projects can be found in Attachment B of this proposal. A DDRESSING GAPS AND WEAKNESSES (Selection Criteria (B)(2); Application Requirement (2)) Ohio's proposal for RemotEDx is designed to respond to the needs of students and address gaps and weaknesses in services, infrastructure and opportunities. The first identified PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e32 Ohio Ohio's logic model: Consistent access to transformative remote education opportunities for Ohio's students, especially its most at-risk populations. Such remote education opportunities are reliant upon the following, also identified in Ohio's logic model: 1) a state-level approach that better coordinates remote education partners, special education services, professional learning providers, information technology partners and innovative field-initiated student learning exemplars; 2) reliable internet access and technology, especially for at -risk populations; and 3) increased approaches to remote education coaching, counseling and professional learning, with a special emphasis on supporting at-risk students. RemotEDx has been designed to respond to leverage the State's assets to respond to weaknesses \u2014especially regarding infrastr ucture and service. Ohio's approach to remote learning has been highly distributed - that is, each school and district, and in some cases, regional groups of districts, have identified, developed and deployed remote learning capabilities that suit their particular needs. The pandemic made it clear that more statewide coordination through development of a thoughtful platform is necessary to coordinate, integrate and replicate opportunities. RemotEDx will drive the development of a state- level infrastructure that builds on existing assets and efforts. Consistent internet and technology-related services also have been challenging. Within one week of Governor Mike DeWine's ordered-school building closure on March 17, over 75 percent of Ohio's schools were providing remote learning opportunities to their students. By mid-April, all schools had shifted completely t o remote learning. At around that same time, the Ohio Department of Education issued a survey to all schools to better understand Ohio's remote learning landscape. The survey (99% response rate) revealed schools were challenged to ensure students had access to internet and technology hardware and appropriate remote learning options PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e33 Ohio TIN: 31 -1334820 ) 19 for special student populations. Table 1 lists schools' top challenges to remote learning (each respondent was asked to identify their top three challenges). Table 1: % of schools identifying challenges to remote learning (as one of their top three challenges) Student access to the internet 69% Student access to hardware (laptop, tablet, etc.) 54% Identifying appropriate learning options for special student populations 51% Staff capacity to implement remote learning 26% Assessing student access to remote learning 22% Understanding frequency of teacher connection/interaction with students 20% Knowledge of effective remo te learning strategies 18% Findings from a study conducted by Ohio Housing Finance Agency in May 2020 offer a close look at the prevalence of limited internet access across the State. It found that one in nine children live in a home with no access to broadband or high-speed internet. Figure 2 includes a district -by-district look. Ohio's Appalachian (Southeast), rural and urban centers are hit hardest. Figure 2 PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e34 Ohio ) 20 RemotEDx's Connectivity Crusaders, working through the Exchange and Network, are specially designed to respond to this need by working with state- level partners (Ohio Department of Education, InnovateOhio, Information Technology Centers, etc.) and schools to help meet students' internet connectivity needs for effective remote educa tion. The Ohio Department of Education's mid -April survey also revealed that 51 percent of schools (refer to Figure 3) were challenged to identify the right remote learning options for special student populations. This data point signals the importance of convening critical partners, providers and supports at the state-level to provide coaching, counseling and professional learning, particularly for serving at-risk and special student populations. RemotEDx will drive statewide coordination of key professional learning providers and supports\u2014namely those offered by Ohio's ESCs, OCALI and related services . RemotEDx will help identify, communicate and syndicate those providers and services to the schools that need them most. Figure 3\u2014Districts indicating challenges \"Identifying appropriate remote learning options for special student populations.\" PR/Award # S425B200035 Page TIN: 31 -1334820 ) 21 EXPANDING ACCESS TO REMOTE EDUCATION AND IMPROVING STUDE NT OUTCOMES (Selection Criteria (B)(3)) Consistent with the project goal, the design theory behind RemotEDx is that greater coordination, integration and expansion pla nning among Ohio's remote education, professional learning, special education, information technology and innovative thought partners and providers will increase access to remot e education and improve student outcomes statewide. The RemotEDx platform concept is like that of the Ohio STEM Network Learning, which has a proven track record (since 2008) of expanding student access to real -world, project- and inquiry-based STEM education opportunities. The public-private nature of RemotEDx will pave the way for similar expansion opportunities. T he Ohio STEM Learning Network is fueled by learning s from its partners and schools. For instance, its first platform school, known as Metro, breaks demographic trends. It is the highest performing school in the S tate when factoring in the percentage of economically disadvantaged students. The lessons from Metro are fed back into the broader Network to drive improvem ents. RemotEDx seeks to achieve comparable outcomes for students through a similarly designed concept. R ESEARCH DRIVEN , EVIDENCE -BASED (Selection Criteria (B)(4)) The RemotEDx concept is informed by a significant body of research and effective practice. It considers: Garrison's Theoretical Challenges for D istance E ducation in the 21st Century; Chapman 's Alternative Approaches to A ssessing Student Enga gement R ates; and The Adol escent Community of Engagement Fr amework.15, 16, 17 This body of research identif ies four main construct s for online learning: student engagement, teacher engagement, peer engagement and parent engagement . Specifically, the Adolescent Community of Engagement Fram ework incorporates the Community of Inquir y Framewo rk, empha sizes sustained communication PR/Award TIN: 31 -1334820 ) 22 among all members of the learning group. This helps increase soci al presence. Full engagement in remote education and learning activities requires affective, behavioral and cognitive engagement\u2014s imilar to the Four Equal Learning Domains identified in Ohio's five-year strategic plan for education . Ohio 's approach to remote education, which includes \" whole child supports\" through caring and teaching and learning , aligns tightly to the research. Ohio will apply these con structs as it implements Remot EDx. Ohio 's approach also will align to the findings of Repetto, Cavanaugh, Wayer and Liu to enhance its approach to improving outcomes for students with disabilit ies in a remote education setting.18 MANAGEMENT PLAN AND RESOURCE ADEQUACY (Selection Criteria (C)) M ANAGEMENT PLAN (Selection Criteria (C)(1)) The project management plan includes appropriate staffing, collaboration with other entities within the Ohio Department of Education, appropriate budget and fiscal controls and a detailed implementation plan created around essential project tasks.

A DEQUACY OF PROPOSED USE OF FUNDS (Selection Criteria (C)(2)) The Budget and Budget Narrative components of this proposal include detailed informat ion about the proposed use of funds. In total, the project is requesting $18.1 million. The following assumptions form the basis for this amount: Staffing: Cost estimates for staffing are based on comparable positions employed by the Department. PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e44 Ohio ) 30 Contracted Support and Services: Contracted expenses are based on comparable activity and functionality procured by the Department. Professional Development: Professional development costs are based on other comparable professional development activity implemented by the Department. REASONABLENESS OF COSTS - OBJECTIVES , DESIGN AND SIGNIFICANCE OF PROJECT (Selection Criteria (C)(3)) The costs for the project are reasonable in terms of meeting the project objectives, achieving the proposed design and given the significance of the project. The response to the section above regarding the adequacy of the use of funds speaks to the reasonableness of costs for the project design. The project is designed to achieve a rapid escalation of high -quality remote education opportunities for students. This interest will be driven by the specific activity of the RemotED x Support Squad. The Squad will help schools and districts clearly understand the value of the offerings and how they can be deployed effectively and sustained. It is expected that there will be significant interest, and the resources being provided will impact the project objectives. R EASONABLENESS OF COSTS - NUMBER OF PERSONS SERVED , RESULTS AND BENEFITS (Selection Criteria (C)(4)) The opportunity to effectuate a significant increase in remote education model deployment through an effort that leverages existing strengths and creates greater awareness, utilization and impact is tremendous. The investment of resources through this proposal will have a significant impact by catalyzing a substantial change in the approach to education in Ohio. The S tate has many field -initiated models, but has lacked the ability to refine, promote and stimulate their adoption - and to do so in a way that pushes educators to think beyond \"business PR/Award # S425B200035 Page ) 31 as usual.\" The project has the ability to impact tens of thousands of students in a positive and meaningful w ay.

In the more than 30 years since its inception, INFOhio \u2014a program of The Management Council of the Ohio Educational Computer Network, an integrated statewide technology solutions delivery system composed of 18 regional Information Technology Centers (IT Cs)\u2014has demonstrated success and functional expertise in communicating and collaborating effectively with a variety of stakeholders and scaling services at a statewide level . These services include curating and licensing digital content that is high -qualit y and standards -aligned; building and supporting online platforms to support teaching and learning for educators and students; and creating and delivering technical and instructional support, along with professional development materials and opportunities, through a variety of platforms to meet user needs. With a primary focus on supporting the schools and students with the greatest need, the digital content curated and licensed by INFOhio, and the online platforms built and supported by INFOhio, are avail able at no cost to Ohio schools. Digital content is evaluated by educators and selected to meet the needs of all students. Serving those with intellectual disabilities and those needing enrichment, digital content includes built -in features to increase eng agement and support students with visual and hearing impairments and emerging and reluctant readers. During the 2019 -2020 school year, INFOhio's content and services were used by students and educators in all school types \u2014public, nonpublic, community, care er tech, e -school, and home schools \u2014 across all 88 counties. Digital Content: INFOhio curates and licenses quality, standards -aligned, digital curriculum materials and instructional resources that support remote, blended, and hybrid teaching and learning. I NFOhio works with content providers and ITCs to establish and enable authentication methods that ensure seamless access, 24/7, from any Internet -connected device in the classroom, at home, or on the go. INFOhio's digital resources for students include hund reds of thousands of full text digital content and electronic media selected to support Ohio's Learning Standards and special learning initiatives. See INFOhio's current collection of Digital Re sources and ISearch . Platforms: INFOhio builds and supports online platforms and tools for students and educators. Web tools for students support blended and project -based learning initiatives and help students develop inquiry and critical thinking skills needed for current and future success. Web tools for educators include a platform for Ohio PreK -12 educators and supporting agencies to collaborate while curating, creating, and sha ring digital learning content. Additionally, INFOhio has developed tools and systems to host and call thousands of aligned digital curriculum materials \u2014 including lesson plans, learning activities, assessments, and more \u2014that teachers can use for remote, ble nded, and hybrid teaching and learning. For students, see the following tools and their accompanying teacher guides: Book Nook ; Go! Ask, Act, Achieve ; IWonder , Research 4 Success . For educators, see Educator Tools and Open Space . Professional Development, Training, and Support: INFOhio creates and delivers technical and instructional support, along wi th professional development materials and opportunities, through which educators learn best practices for using INFOhio's digital content and web tools, integrating technology into instruction, and adopting strategies that support curriculum and PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e98 positively impact student learning. Educators can earn contact hours or college credit through a variety of self -paced, online learning options. Education agencies can use INFOhio training curriculum, at no cost, to construct and lead their own professional developm ent offerings. Through INFOhio's coaching programs, Ohio PreK -12 educators receive training on best practices for integrating INFOhio digital resources into instruction and curriculum and become certified to share their learning with their colleagues, othe r Ohio educators, and parents. As of June 2020, INFOhio has 358 certified INFOhio Integration Coaches ( ICoaches ) in 234 districts covering 74 counties, and 78 certified INFOhio Integration Partners ( IPartners ) in 60 education agencies including ESCs, ITCs, public and academic libraries, Ed Techs, State Support Teams, and more.

Educators will find les son plans and learning activities to support Social Emotional Learning in INFOhio's Educator Tools. Collaboration and Strategic Partnerships : INFOhio engages in cost collaboration with key state library partners to license large collections of vital digita l content. This reduces duplication in the administration of the bidding and content evaluation processes and allows INFOhio to acquire more than three times the content we could if we did it alone. This also allows us to curate a collection that supports the learning needs of all Ohioans at all stages of life. Through the INFOhio IPartner program, staff in education agencies including ESCs, ITCs, public and academic libraries, Ed Techs, and State Support Teams receive free training on INFOhio online tools and digital resources. Those staff are certified to use INFOhio training materials to construct their own professi onal development and training programs. INFOhio's investment in providing the initial training and the training materials makes it possible for those partnering agencies to reach more educators than INFOhio could reach on our own. With additional funding, INFOhio would: develop and support the platform that allows for member content submission, creation, curation, and collaboration for the Transformative Education and Remote Learning Marketplace/Commons/Hub in collaboration with other model agencies and the Ohio Department of Education; provide technical and instructional support to other model agencies and the Ohio Department of Education for contributing content to the Marketplace/Commons/Hub; deliver training to other model agencies and the Ohio Departme nt of Education on best practices for using the collaboration, curation, and authoring tools in the platform for the Marketplace/Commons/Hub; curate additional digital learning and curriculum resources to support remote, blended, and hybrid teaching and l earning that all Ohio PreK -12 schools could use at no cost; align additional digital content to Ohio Learning Standards; ensure seamless access to digital learning and curriculum resources to support remote, blended, and hybrid teaching and learning thro ugh the INFOhio website; PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e99 develop and deliver professional development and training materials on new digital learning and curriculum resources; provide first -line technical and instructional support for all digital resources and platforms licensed or host ed by INFOhio; expand communication with stakeholders and users, soliciting user input to determine user needs, to ensure that the goal of improving equity in remote learning is achieved. As we have for more than 30 years, INFOhio , a program of the Manag ement Council, will support areas with the greatest need by continuing to curate premium digital content and build and support online teaching and learning tools that can be used at no cost by all Ohio's PreK -12 students, educators, and parents.

ESCs are the largest component of the state's Educational Reginal Se rvice System (ERSS), which has the statutory mandate to support state and regional education initiatives and efforts to improve school effectiveness and student achievement. The primary ESC service areas are centered around 1) curriculum and instruction, 2) school improvement, 3) professional development, 4) special education and related services, 5) preschool , and 6) implementation of statewide initiatives charged to the ESCs by the Ohio General Assembly or department of education . The primary audience f or ESC services are schools and school districts and community -based organizations serving schools. All districts under 16,000 ADM are required to be aligned to an ESC, while those over 16,000 ADM can opt into aligning with an ESC. Ohio's ESCs provide both contracted and state required services to all 610 public school districts, 165 chartered non -public schools, and 99 charter schools. ESC services impact well over 1.5 million students - inside of this, ESCs provide direct services to approximately 269,000 students many of whom are at -risk. ESCs also support education professionals. In the 2018 -2019 school year, Ohio's ESCs hosted 6,692 discrete professional development offerings attended by over 205,000 educators and education st akeholders. ESCs also lead over 90% of the state's Business Advisory Councils connecting schools and the business community. Ohio's 51 ESCs are geographically located across the state of Ohio to ensure proximity of service delivery. Ohio's ESCs employ o ver 14,000 full -time staff and deliver nearly $1.4 billion in educational support services to Ohio's students and schools annually. ESCs have various job -a-like networks that include over 200 curriculum and instruction staff, content areas specialists (math, science, english language arts, social studies), 37 directors of technology , 55 family and community liaisons, 69 regional data leads (RDLs), 517 school psychologists and 157 counselors and social workers as well as directo rs of special education, school improvement, gifted education and more. In response to the COVID -19 pandemic, and in support of the work of the High School Redesign Taskforce and the statewide strategic plan for education, Each Child, Our Future , 150 curr iculum and instruction and school improvement staff, content area specialists and others from 31 ESCs have collaborated around a Reframing Education Initiative and workgroup . The vision of th is Reframing Education collaborative effort is to create a decisi on-making framework to support districts as they consider best practices that have emerged as a result of school closures, have authentic conversations about instructional expectations and make plans to reframe and rethink the delivery of high quality education al opportunities for all students and schools . This collaborative approach also seek s to leverage ESC's direct relationships with the 16 State Support Teams (SSTs) and 69 Regional Data Leads (RDLs) - all of which are ESC employees - and with Ohio's network of information technology centers ( ITCs ). Other innovative ESC networks include the Remote Learning Alliance. The Remote Learning Alliance (RLA) is a group of education al organizations committed to the collective impact of helping districts make a smooth and impactful transition to remote learning. The Educational Service Centers of Central Ohio, Montgomery County, Northeast Ohio, and Hamilton County serve as founding pa rtners. Membership is open to a ll districts and ESCs, especially districts who serve the state's most marginalized populations. PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e101 Ohio's ESCs partner directly with the state of Ohio and the Ohio Department of Education around the implementation of 1) Scho ol Improvement through the 16 state support teams ( SSTs ), 2) School Climate Grants through the PBIS network, 3) Teacher and Principal Evaluation Systems (OTES/OTES2.0/OPES) and the effective use of data to inform instruction through the regional data leads (RDLs). ESCs are also actively engaged in efforts to enhance remote learning in their own organizations and with their client school districts . According to June 2020 survey data from the Ohio ESC Association : - 100% of ESCS indicated they are providing professional development related to educational technology and remote learning . - 89% provide teletherapy services for students with disabilities utilizing ESC -based therapy staff. - 57% provide online instruction speciall y designed for students with disabilities using a combination of ESC staff and external providers like Vizzle. - 52% of Ohio's ESCs identify, review and approve content providers and other curriculum and instruction resources on behalf of school districts. - 47% provide a full online curriculum option for client school districts . - 30% provide online instruction using synch ronous two -way interactive video distance learning. In the 2018 -2019 school year, Ohio's ESCs hosted 6,692 discrete professional development offerings attended by over 205,000 educators and education stakeholders. During the COVID -19 pandemic and resulti ng school closures, 100% of ESCS indicated they are providing professional development related to educational technology and remote learning including technology integration (77%), remote learning (77%), Google for Education (77%), Future Ready Framework ( 30%), digital literacy (46%), instructional strategies (84%), digital citizenship (23%), and other including SEL, assessment practices, Project Based Learning, Modern Teacher. ESCs serve as the \"boots on the ground\" support of statewide efforts and can support the Rethinking K-12 Education models grant and related efforts with the following: the identification, review/vetting and procurement of providers of courses and content; ensuring curricular alignment to state standards; curation of instructi onal resources by content area; technology integration into instruction; building administrator and teacher capacity to deliver instruction successfully in a remote learning environment; and ongoing technical assistance and support. Further , ESCs have the ability to provide direct instruction and delivery of hard to staff subject areas and accelerated courses through interactive video ; the East Central Ohio ESC , Muskingum Valley ESC and Northeast Ohio ESC current ly provide this direct instruction through t heir partnership with the Ohio Distance Learning Association . ESCs also offer a variety of social and emotional l earning and other behavioral health supports. Ohio's ESCs have been trained by the Ohio Department of Education staff around PBIS to support i mplementation of the State's School Climate Grants and are an integral part of the statewide PBIS network in partnership with SSTs . Additionally , ESCs employ 157 counselors and social workers as well as 517 school psychologists and provide services around PBIS, PAX, trauma informed care and other social emotional learning supports. ESCs often coordinate with other partners to maximize remote learning/service without creating duplication - this mandate is engrained in 3312.01 of the Ohio Revised Code. Ohio's ESCs are also members /owners of the state's information technology centers (ITCs) and work to coordinate service delivery. Whereas ITCs focus on technology infrastructure and data collection, ESCs focus on curriculum and in struction and the effective use of data to inform instruction; it is a symbiotic relationship. Likewise , Ohio's ESCs often partner with Ohio's 8 education technology centers that are affiliated with the state's public broadcasting stations to develop less ons plans for teachers that are aligned to public broadcasting content. Additionally t welve Ohio ESCs have 19 iPartners through InfOhio. The INFOhio Integration Partner program, or IPartner program, is for staff in Ohio education agencies \u2014ESCs, ITCs, Ed Techs, universities, public or academic libraries, and more \u2014who are interested in learning and sharing about INFOhio's digital content and web tools and how to integrate them into PreK -12 ins truction. PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e102 As a partner in the Rethinking K -12 Education Models grant, a dditional funding would enhance the scope and reach of remote learning opportunities to all students in Ohio. Additional funding can be utilized to leverage existing programs and ser vices, create new opportunities and offerings and scale those opportunities statewide with a focus on equal opportunity for all students - a key component of the statewide strategic plan for education, Each Child Our Future . Equity of opportunity is cent ral to the role of ESCs. As consortia -based service delivery models, ESCs pull together the collective resources of client school districts to ensure access to high quality opportunities for all students . This is a foundational design element of the ESC organization. ESCs provide direct services to many underserved and at -risk youth. For example, 43 ESCs operate 106 general education preschools and 456 integrated special education preschool classrooms; 43 operate ED/SBH classrooms; 41 operate MD classrooms; 37 operate alternative schools for at -risk youth ; and 18 operate dropout recovery schools. Because of their geographic proximity and requirement that they serve all school districts, ESCs are well positioned to ensure equal access to high quality opportunities for all. PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e103 The Remote Learning Alliance was created in direct response to the Executive Order issued in March 2020, that closed public schools, but required public education to move forward as a result of the COVID -19 Pandemic. The Remote Learning Alliance (RLA) is a group of educational organizations committed to the collective impact of helping make the transition to remote learning as easy and robust as possible for Ohio school leaders, teachers, and support personnel. The Educational Service Centers of Central Ohio, Montgomery County, Northeast Ohio, and Hamilton County serve as founding partners to give a broad reach to district service provision across the state of Ohio. All districts and ESCs are welcome to participate in the collective impact the Re mote Learning Alliance provides, especially districts who serve our most marginalized populations. Remote Learning Alliance strives to meet these four goals: 1. Support school leaders, teachers, and support personnel as they operationalize their continuity of education plans 2. Engage all regions of Ohio who wish to participate in the Remote Learning Alliance 3. Serve as hub for school districts to scale learning opportunities, resource sharing, and support 4. Partner with the best remote learning experts in the nati on who can help us support our schools To achieve its mission, the Remote Learning Alliance leverages all available resources, including: new and existing technology; local and national expertise; and current and future public funds and grants. Specific services currently include Professional Learning Remote Learning Training Needs Assessments Reopening Checklist Strategic Planning K-12 Online Curriculum Professional Networks Graduation Support Learning Management Systems Content Management Systems Digital Resource Organization Virtual Summer School Modules Curriculum Access and Development PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e104 Tech Support Device Procurement Vendor vetting and contract brokerage Since March, 25 districts have engaged in the Remote Learning Alliance in some capacity, while 13 districts in Franklin, Preble, and Montgomery counties have begun Digital Convergence training with their staffs in order to stand up Remote Learning options for students who choose not to return to a physical school building for the 2020 - 2021 school year or when a district may need to switch over to a full remote learning environment. It is our belief that blended and remote learning environments will not fade away with the discovery of a COVID -19 vaccination, but rather will have already established their well deserved place in public education as best practice. Additionally, over 200 online events for networks of role -alike professionals have occurred throug h a partnership with the Buckeye Association of School Administrators allowing for hundreds of school personnel to meet weekly to embrace COVID -19 impacted practices. The importance of these digital networking meetings has set the stage for on -going statew ide collaboration, even post COVID -19. As we continue to move districts through continuity of education planning for the 2020 - 2021 school year and beyond, we know social and emotional well -being will continue to be vital for students and staff. Montgomer y County, specifically, and others provide a variety of SEL resources and training including but not limited to: integrated online curriculum, SEL consultation, prevention programming, whole child planning, and family engagement in a digital world to ensur e districts have the resources needed to support staff and student social and emotional wellness. Montgomery County ESC represents OESCA on the Ohio Department of Education's Collaborate State Initiative Team led by CASEL. Just as important as an intentio nality in SEL services, the Remote Learning Alliance intentionally works through an Equity Lens as we embrace a collective impact model. Most specifically we understand districts who serve the most marginalized students have had the hardest time adequately serving students during the mandated school building closures. The Remote Learning Alliance prioritizes quality teacher and curricular access for students, while understanding device access and internet security are also evidence of inequities in our most challenged school districts. Since standing up RLA, in Montgomery County over $280,000 of local philanthropic dollars has been secured for device procurement to maximize bulk ordering on behalf of high Socioeconomic Districts in Montgomery County. This pr ocess can now be replicated by other participating ESCs. ESCs naturally have been hubs for collaborative efforts. PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e105 The Remote Learning Alliance Steering Committee meets weekly to ensure all partners provide services without competitive duplication in addit ion, they have an advisory portion of the committee who represent varied districts in order to ensure the \"field\" views are adequately represented. This group has also refined protocols for districts and ESCs choosing to collaborate within the alliance so that the collective impact model is respected. This allows for an equitable distribution of service with an access point for everyone who subscribes to the mutually held mission of the Remote Learning Alliance. Part of the protocol is the use of an establi shed and vetted needs assessment. This allows the alliance to yield effective results by meeting the needs of the individual districts, again through an equity lens. The role the Remote Learning Alliance can play in this grant, is to serve as the hub from which many partners can provide their niche services. Through our OESCA network, even the ESCs that may not be staffed adequately, can provide regional assistance to their districts by tapping into the alliance's full roster of partners, thus leveraging t he resources to the entire state. Funding through this grant would support the availability of RLA partners' service to all districts in the state of Ohio. Further, the use of federal dollars can engage other funders who believe private/public partnership s are a way to leverage braided funding in a way that alleviates funding burdens on sole source providers. This is an authentic outcome of a true collective impact model. And last but not least, we have hovered our proverbial mouse over 21st Century Learni ng and Teaching for two decades now. Funding through this grant will allow us to finally click our mouse and truly join the 21st Century by engaging in a model education that allows for the fluent navigation between and among remote learning, blended learn ing and face -to-face learning, while caring for our students and staff. All of which are appropriate and needed in this time of COVID -19 and beyond. But to truly rethink education we must be confident that we are able to tangibly re -tool education. By usin g a true collective impact model, the Remote Learning Alliance will enable districts to do just that. Additional partners also involved in this particular grant application include: ohio Department of Education, OESCA, Ohio STEM Learning Network, TIES, IN FOhio, and StartSOLE. PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e106 The Management Council and Ohio's Information Technology Centers Supporting Ohio's schools through both administrative and educational technologies, t he Ohio Education Computer Network is made up of Ohio's 18 Information Technology Centers (ITCs) and their coordinating body, called the Management Council (which includes the INFOhio program and serves as the fiscal agent for the Ohio Distance Learning Association ). Initiated over 40 years ago, the ITCs provide five statutorily articulated core functi ons for Ohio's 600+ school districts. These applications include fiscal (accounting, payroll, human resources, etc.), student (scheduling, grading, attendance, demographics, etc.), digital resources (library automation, journals, digital content, etc. - through INFOhio), Internet connectivity, and EMIS data collection (the statewide accountability and information system). Each ITC also provides data services, network and video support, and a multitude of other technology solutions. The Management Counci l engages in statewide coordination of ITC services and technology vendor relationships while optimizing partnerships with other statewide associations that represent ESCs, superintendents, school boards, treasurers, public television stations, the Broadca st Education Media Commission, and philanthropic sources. The Management Council also provides an array of services through grants and contracts for the Ohio Department of Education and other governmental agencies. Through this work, the Management Counc il and the ITCs provide services to all of the public schools and many of the non -public schools in Ohio, impacting essentially all of Ohio's 1.7M K12 population. The services, however, extend well beyond back office and administrative operations. In add ition to the digital learning resources and professional development that ITCs and the Management Council provide though INFOhio, many ITCs are partnered with ESCs to provide web -based options for remote learning. Moreover, ITCs and the Management Council are the providers of extraordinarily low -cost Zoom professional video conference licensing to schools, and have been instrumental in arranging remote learning capabilities for students , particularly in underserved areas of t he state. This has been accomplished through exterior and mobile installations of Internet connectivity and through negotiations with providers for low cost hotspots and reduced rates for data usage in underserved areas. Management Council and ITCs hav e leveraged INFOhio digital resources and training, ESC curricular and instructional expertise, and vendor academic content to optimize these devices and connectivity for remote learning, particularly for underrepresented students. Furthermore, the Manage ment Council and the ITCs recently undertook an effort to map student device access (computer, Chromebook, tablet, smartphone) and Internet connectivity to the level of detail of mapping these two critical capabilities for remote learning for every student address in the state in an effort to fully appreciate the magnitude of the challenge of providing remote learning to every student home. The video licensing, connectivity and device mapping, as well as outdoor and mobile hotspots not only enables remote learning by connecting students to their own classes and schools, this PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e107 expansion of connectivity will enable Ohio to implement a \"StubHub \"-type class and seat statewide exchange that will exponentially expand the opportunities for students to access resou rces, classes and curriculum that were never previously available. The Management Council and partner ITCs have embarked on software development that will make this exchange a reality - additional funding would expedite this service. Having this capability will bring a new level of learning opportunities to students across Ohio, and make it possible for many more Ohio learners to be prepared to participate in the 21st century economy. Another area of impact for students in Ohio is t hrough the Man agement Council's statewide relationship with GenerationYes . In this endeavor, ITCs are training school personnel in districts across the state to engage students in grades 3 -12 to be come learning partners with their teachers . In this highly regarded pro gram, students grow socially and emotionally as mentors to younger students, develop understanding and confidence while serving as content co - developers with teachers, and build technical skills that prepare them for careers, higher education, and by estab lishing technology service desks they expand local capacity that enables 1 to 1 programs to flourish in schools. The ITCs and the Management Council are positioned to continue to deepen and broaden these capabilities that already impact students statewi de; the technical expertise and capacity found in the 18 ITCs and the Management Council form a foundation upon which all of the remote learning partnerships can reliably excel . This foundation eliminates barriers of time, space, communication, and pace th at typically constrain teaching and learning environments; this foundation undergirds the thoughtful and dynamic models advocated in this Rethinking K -12 Education proposal. PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e108 The Ohio Distance Learning Association, OhioDLA, began in the late 1990s through grant funding which enabled a videoconferencing infrastructure to be established in Ohio schools. Schools, educational service organizations, and content providers began to collaborate, to learn how to better serve schools and students through distance learning. In 2012, OhioDLA established its non -profit charter United States Distance Learning Association membership, giving members a more legitimate voice to help in fluence state educational and legislative decision -makers, to ultimately bring greater educational opportunities to all students. OhioDLA members are leaders and innovators, who have created exceptional programs such as daily classes that expand opportuni ties in K -12 schools, including college credit; award -winning content programs by some of the nation's leading providers - right in Ohio, and for relevant professional development and outreach activities that members deliver to Ohio schools and educators. Member programs are aligned to Ohio and national standards, and OhioDLA stands in support of critical educational initiatives, as de fined by the Ohio Department of Education. Recently, OhioDLA has partnered with the Management Council of the Ohio Educati on Computer Network (MCOECN) to radically expand cloud -based video conferencing, and is developing a state -based daily class and content marketplace exchange, to bring distance learning opportunities to all schools and students in Ohio. This initiative ha s given Ohio schools and students a distinct advantage as the pandemic situation has unfolded. The specific medium supported by OhioDLA initiatives is live, two -way video, whether through traditional videoconferencing equipment or cloud -based videoconfere ncing. Participants include P -20 schools, individual students, homeschool students, educators, and educational support staff, including ITCs, ESCs, EdTechs, INFOhio, and BEMC. Member daily class programs deliver live, two -way videoconferencing into tradi tional classrooms and to individual students. They have enabled school districts to maintain or expand course offerings, and to provide remedial and advanced opportunities to students. The service permits efficient distribution of typical and specialized courses, filling specific district needs and bell schedule requirements, and enabling efficient use of instructor time. These also include after -school programs. Disadvantaged students, and those who are ill or unable to be in school can fully participa te due to the flexibility of videoconferencing. Recording of some classes and testing review material allows additional flexibility for educators and students. This model has existed for over a decade and demand has expanded through time. In 2019 -2020, the program administered by the partnership of the East Central Ohio Educational Service Center and the Licking Area Computer Association Information Technology Center delivered nearly 60 daily courses in Chinese, American Sign Language, and Spanish to 17 districts and 1054 students. These opportunities meet ODE Equity objectives, enabling any school or student anywhere in the state to participate, regardless of geographic or economic constraint. Content programming comprises a strong component of OhioDLA member activities. Notable institutions including Cleveland Clinic, COSI Columbus, Cleveland Museum of Natural History, Ohio History Connection, and Pro Football Hall of Fame, specializing in areas of medicine, science, history, art, sports, and music - have developed live, two - way virtual field -trip programs, which are offered to schools and students as a supplement to their standard curriculum. Several of these institutions have won national recognition for the quality of their programming. Examples o f programs include live surgery connections, interactive scientific lab experiments, connections with authors, and career -oriented forums. A recent OhioDLA -organized series with an author in February, 2020 generated involvement of 12 districts and 436 stu dents. Programs are evolving to keep students engaged through the summer, including virtual summer camps available to individuals. These invaluable experiences bring opportunity to underrepresented students, and the interactive nature of the connections allows students to ask questions and engage with professionals. Student dialogue with presenters fosters a personal connection, which leads to an enriching learning experience. One -on-one connections are critical, especially in an environment of physical distancing. PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e109 Collaborative arrangements in which classrooms and students connect together, allow for engaging exercises that enable students from disparate districts to work and learn with one another. Recent collaborative projects arranged by OhioDLA in clude such names as Math Marvels, Holiday Storytelling, Monster Match, and The Mitten. Collaborations in the 2019 -2020 school year have involved 68 educators and 320 classroom -to-classroom students. OhioDLA strongly supports outreach activities. Members regularly participate in state meetings and conferences, such as provided by the Ohio School Boards Association and Ohio Educational Service Center Association, to inform schools and officials of distance learning opportunities, and to learn from them. O hioDLA has supported the distance learning strand of the Ohio Educational Technology Conference for over a decade. OETC is the pre -eminent Ohio K -12 technology venue, allowing educators and administrators to experience live class and content provider conn ections, and to interact with the latest videoconferencing equipment and software. Ohio Department of Education staff have presented at OhioDLA meetings on subjects such as Future Ready and Career Connections, resulting in initiatives such as the Career C onnections Showcase delivered statewide to educators, guidance counselors, and administrators in October, 2019. OhioDLA constantly seeks engagement by members and peer organizations, and through active USDLA involvement, is focused on aligning with and le arning from other state chapters. In January, 2020, the USDLA began a spotlight campaign to help recognize state chapter activities, and chose OhioDLA to be the first chapter to be highlighted on their website. These relationships helped drive the concep t for the coursework and content marketplace, and other state systems have served as a model. The OhioDLA Governing Advisory Board has worked hard to be aware of advancements in distance learning, but also to respond to the needs of schools and educators. When the pandemic surfaced, OhioDLA members created a twice -daily statewide support conference on Zoom, to allow newcomers to learn basics and ask questions. This service has been used by hundreds of educators across Ohio and served a critical need. Me mbers assisted the MCOECN with webinars on distance learning best -practices and functionality, creating a repository of quality instructional videos to meet immediate educator needs. OhioDLA professional development activities in 2019 -2020 have included p resentations by Zoom, Google/Internet Awesome, CILC, Flipgrid, Newsela, DTEN, Poly, Empatico, and have involved over 250 educator and administrator participants statewide. The mission statement of OhioDLA is to, \"Promote and foster the formation of partne rships among schools and affiliates to further the effective use of distance learning.\" The organization of nearly 500 members is uniquely positioned to assist schools, educators, and students as they transition to remote and blended learning models, due to the vast experience and diversity of its members. OhioDLA can assist with social and emotional needs through webinar and outreach activities. The organization seeks to work with similar -minded groups, and to eliminate duplicative efforts in an attempt to most effectively reach and benefit schools and students statewide. Additional funding will help OhioDLA realize its goal of helping students throughout the state. Distance Learning by nature implies universal inclusion, however many barriers currentl y exist. Funding allows equipment to be placed in schools and with educators and students, and to pay for videoconferencing software licensing. It will help pay for professional development to assure that educators and facilitators are empowered to deliv er quality instruction. Funding could be used to improve the OhioDLA website and stipends could be created to leverage dedicated staffing and guide initiatives, as the organization is currently 100% volunteer driven. The ultimate goal is to help all stud ents, regardless of conditions that are beyond their control.

The network fosters a culture of STEM learning statewid e through: STEM Programming - Assisting schools and communities to create innovative schools and programs Regional Network Support - Connecting innovative schools, teachers and administrators to one another and to state and national resources STEM Designation - managing the statewide STEM school designation process as a measure of quality Battelle manages the network. Battell e is the world's largest independent research and development institute. The company leads several state and national efforts in STEM including the Tennessee STEM Innovation Network, the national STEMx network and the Army Educational Outreach Program. In total, Battelle's education projects and its philanthropy have reached more than 300,000 young people over the last year. Primary audiences The Ohio STEM Learning Network engages with Ohio educators and the students they seek to inspire. Programs are ide ntified in high need areas where the network can have the greatest impact. Current program s include: The Innovative Leaders Institute : The year -long cohort program supports administrators and other school -based leaders (including teachers ) in leading the c hange in their schools to provide authentic, relevant learning experiences to all of their students. This program has reached more than 200 teachers and administrators since 2013. Computer Science through the Code.org Ohio partnership : This program has wo rked to advance computer science education by training 493 K -12 teachers since 2016 to teach the subject. These teachers are collectively teaching computer science to more than 19,500 students each year . Annual Statewide Student Design Challenge: The year -long challenge calls for students to research, build and test a solution to a designated problem and then present their ideas . 2020 marked the fourth statewide challenge as more than 3,700 students applied their STEM skills to solve local and statewide tr ansportation challenges. Reach and key services After more than a decade of expansion and community building, the Ohio STEM Learning Network has built a web of connections to communities across the state. Whether through regional hubs, a community's local STEM school, or our wide audience of educators who have participated in our STEM trainings, we reach across the state. PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e111 Battelle | Date 2 Under the Rethinking K -12 Education Models program, we are prepared to deliver new opportunities to Ohio educators and students around critical STEM education concepts including design thinking, mastery learning, problem -based learning , leadership development, and community -centered design challenges . Transformative impact Our network was formed to spread the transformative impact of STEM education, based on the early success of the Metro Early College High School in Columbus Ohio. This open -access school has maintained a 100% graduation and college acceptance rate since ope ning in 2006. Based on that model, the number of designated STEM schools across the state has risen to 79, Cumulatively, these schools serve more than 30,000 students each year. These schools serve as an engine of educational innovation. For example, many STEM schools had already implemented virtual days in advance of the COVID -19 crisis. Just three weeks after schools closed in Ohio, we compiled the key insights from these schools into a special report to help other institutions successfully navigate the crisis. Our network also hosted a range of trainings and workshops with educators across the state, helping them navigate the challenges of this new learning environment. Remote learning opportunities The Ohio STEM Learning Network is well positioned to lead deployment of a range of new supports for students an d teachers. Our ongoing professional development programs (Innovative Leaders Institute and Code.org Professional Learning Program) has already successfully transitioned to 100% distance learning delivery. Our team stands ready to expand these programs to cover the questions facing educators, including: How can teachers embed high -quality inquiry and group learning projects into distance learning? What effective and efficient assessments can be leveraged to incorporate mastery learning into a distance lea rning platform? How can students connect with problems in their community online, when speakers cannot visit classrooms? Moreover, the Ohio STEM Learning Network is designed to present these solutions in an equitable way. Since its inception, the network h as committed to quality STEM education for all. This includes admission to STEM schools, which may not issue academic prerequisites for admission and must reflect the demographics of their communities. This commitment extends through our professional devel opment programming, where we focus scholarships and recruitment on communities of high need. PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e112 StartSOLE : A Delivery Platform for Accelerating Education Innovations for Remote Learning StartSOLE LLC is an Ohio -based enterprise that supports educators and learners with pedagogically - sound products and services delivered over a continuum of environments from face -to-face to fully remote situations . Members of StartSOLE LLC all have advance d education and interdisciplinary backgrounds that enables the enterprise to apply the best thinking from various sectors to design products and services for educators. We do this with design thinking, pedagogical principles, and rapid prototyping. Our developments are never in isolation - we codevelop applications directly with teachers, institutions, policymakers, and workforce developers. Teachers can find StartSOLE on their own, but more likely it is through our network and educational service center pa rtners. Self-Organized Learning Environments - Let Learning Happen. The company was founded in 2014 and is named after the first product that the organization successfully launched in 2018 - StartSOLE. StartSOLE is an excellent example of the Field -Inspired Application s Organizations that are addressed in Ohio's proposal. StartSOLE began by taking one of the most powerful learning processes \u2014problem -based learning (PBL) and inquiry \u2014and created a technology platform to enable PBL to be used directly by teachers seamlessly in their existing classrooms. Problem -based learning i n some form is practiced at virtually all high -performing educational locations across the country. PBL requires training, special affordances in the classroom, and \u2014most of all \u2014time. It is difficult to integrate this idea into existing schools with existin g teachers, while they already have lesson plans and schedules to follow that permit little flexibility for inclusion of new experiences for the students. The founders of StartSOLE hypothesized that it would be possible to bring the foundations of inquiry with technology to assist the teacher in facilitating a PBL exercise in their existing classroom in a seamless fashion that does not require them to (1) change their schedules or (2) devote an impractical amount of time to the implementation or to try it out in the first place. The result of this was the first application launched by StartSOLE in 2018 and is being used in 1/3 of Ohio's schools and reaching 100,000 students. It is called self -organized learning environments (SOLEs) and here is a snapshot o f what it does. HOW DO LIVING THINGS EFFECT OUR PLANET ? IS IT POSSIBLE TO RID THE WORLD OF BULLYING? HOW DOES MOOD EFFECT HOW PEOPLE LEARN? DO WARRING NATIONS ADVANCE TECHNOLOGY QUICKER THAN PEACEFUL ONES? These are some of the many questions that students working in a Self -Organized Learning Environment (SOLE) have asked of themselves and their peers. And then, they've set out to find answer s in a learning journey that is packed with tangible and diverse skill -building opportunities. That's the BIG IDEA implemented in our first fielded application the StartSOLE technology platform. The concept of a self - PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e113 organized learning environment is a cat alytic innovation that empowers the student to explore multiple new dimensions of autonomy while collaborating (virtually or in person) with a group of peers. StartSOLE is a technology platform that seamlessly facilitates this process for the educator into their natural classroom environment without any special preparation or extensive training. The process takes a single class period in a single classroom. It begins by having students in small groups consider an open -ended question provided by the teacher or by the students themselves. Students spend a portion of the class period researching the question on internet -connected devices, while preparing a presentation in a group. After the research period, each group then presents to the class and discussion f ollows. The questions align with the teacher's content area and deepen learning in areas already being taught. What is the VALUE of the StartSOLE Platform? StartSOLE is more than just a way to deliver self - organized learning experiences. It is, at its core, a platform that can deliver complex processes and complex technologies directly to students by enabling the facilitation aspects of the new idea to be in tegrated into the classroom or virtual experience. Further, this is not just a technology \"trick.\" Everything that StartSOLE does is intentional to address the four needs and barriers teachers describe for using new education innovations. StartSOLE has des igned a method of : (1) reaching teachers with tools they can use with little or no preparation, (2) teaching them, (3) connecting them to a larger community powerful enough they can see the value right away (like automated lesson plans), an d, (4) providing it free of charge. Consider this one proof point of the pla tform behind S tartSOLE . When COVID19 happened and schools were closed , in a matter of 10 days, the development team at StartSOLE had created and launched a virtual version of the application. Thi s enabled every teacher that already had familiarity to use the in - class version to seamlessly move to StartSOLE virtual. Webinars were also held state -wide in Ohio to bring the technology platform to additional teachers. In a matter of weeks, StartSOLE vi rtual allowed inquiry learning to continue, with everyone sheltered in place. What Does This Offer for Reaching the Most Vulnerable with Remote Learning ? First, StartSOLE meets educators where they are at. Innovations do not have to originate from our enterprise to use the StartSOLE platform; in fact, our model at the outset was that StartSOLE would serve as a way to insert existing ideas and process innovations directly in the classroom in a non -intimidating way for the teacher. That is why StartSO LE begins any endeavors by meeting educators where they are at - physically, socially, and emotionally. StartSOLE is currently developing and piloting a Design of an Education Continuum methodology that enables educators and administers to consider the del ivery of education across a continuum of traditional classroom, hybrid learning, open campus, and complete remote environments. Along with this, StartSOLE is also developing a student -centered set of tools to help students harness a knowledge of social -emo tional skills that are considered critical in developing deeper learning skills.

TIES has been a co -designer of some of the most successful STEM ventures across Ohio, the nation and globe. TIES has developed PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e115 2 \"Community as the Campus: Leading with Learning,\" a comprehensive systems transformation framework involving instructional progra m redesign and implementation and partnership redesign with an ecosystems approach all through an equity and SEL focus . TIES contributed to the White House Office Science Technology Policy's current 5 -Year STEM Plan , which lists forming STEM Ecosystems as the top priority for improving STEM education across the U.S. TIES is the co -designer and operator of the STEM Learning Ecosystems Community of Practice, a network of 89 ecosystems serving millions of students , including six in Ohio. Ecosystem behavior for all of Ohio's communities will make this change happen. Remote Learning Opportunities WHAT IF ... REMOTE LEARNING COULD INVOLVE THE COMMUNITY AS THE CAMPUS ? Schools must be reimagined with a n understanding of how learning happens , what factors influence it and an appreciation for partnerships . Covid 19 disruptions affect more than classrooms and we must consider impact on our community from educators and their families, to learners and their families and every system and resource u pon which we rely. TIES takes a systems -thinking approach to this challenge by design ing learning with the Community as Campu s and leveraging all stakeholders . TIES works with partners to ensure learning systems are flexible, sustainable and capable of ope rating in all modalities.

Covid 19 Relief Efforts PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e116 3 WHAT IF ... REAL SOCIAL JUSTICE IS A PRODUCT OF NEW VISIONS WITH NOVEL ACTION? By un derstanding community, student and family needs, schools can drive social justice. Existing resources can be reallocated to offer meaningful learning opportunities that also have positive ripple effects for families and community. TIES works with you to bu ild partnered initiatives to address traditional student learning and social -emotional needs while also focusing on community and family challenges. For instance, TIES developed a learn -and-earn pilot program, WIR'ED, launched in March 2020, where Clevelan d students are paid for coaching brick -and-mortar stores into creating actionable online presences. TIES has developed resources to further understandings of STEM as a driver of equity and social mobility, including its STEM@HOME series. Improving Equity Through Innovative Solutions WHAT IF ... WE COULD ENSURE EQUITY THROUGH INNOVATION? To protect the health of Ohio's students and citizens, schools must change many practices , but the vision of Ohio's strategic plan, Each Child, Our Future, can continue with its three core principles - equity, partnerships, and quality schools. TIES ' design studio s, which start with identification of the needs of communities , allows for the three principles to be seamlessly integrated and for social -emotional learning and other needs to be addressed. We work rapidly to get stakeholders to define success and measure impact and often partner with local and national organizations to fill gaps uncovered in learning sessions. Transforming Re mote Learning and Opportunities for Growth WHAT IF ... TRANSFORMATION BECAME THE ROLE OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY? TIES is interested in partnering with districts for a re-design of their schools to create systems to enable learning to become platform agnostic. Additional funding would allow this to happen. Our approach to support teaching and learning is based on student -centered design so that learning experiences are asset -oriented/strength -based and enable student s to learn in their own way. This is especially important for marginalized students. Equity is at the core of TIES' services by the very nature of its inclusive approach to its work and by the intentional focus on STEM as a driver of social mobility and eq uity. PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e117 1 Bonds of Union Program Overview Bonds of Union is a nonprofit organization based in Cincinnati that develops and implements innovative initiatives to address persistent social and economic challenges facing low -income communities. Ascend, Bonds of Union's current pilot initiative, aims to dramatically transform how we deliver instruction to our lowest -performing students in urban public schools and improve academic and social -emotional outcomes for this population. During the 2019 -2020 school year, Ascend served students in grades four through six at Bond Hill Academy, an elementary school in the Cincinnati Public Schools district that serves as the pilot site for Ascend's demonstration phase. During the 2020 -2021 school year, Ascen d will scale to serve approximately thirty -two students, 50% of all lowest -performing students in mathematics in grades three through five at Bond Hill Academy, through the delivery of both in -person and live, online instruction. Ascend works with low -performing students who performed in the bottom two tiers on the math state test during the previous school year. Ascend's Learning Coaches and participating students work together one -on-one for 90 minutes a week on individualized, \"low -floor, high - ceiling\" math tasks that foster a growth mindset and support social -emotional development. Ascend's Habits of Mind are thoughtfully embedded into all math tasks, individualized in curriculum to support the unique social -emotional needs of each student. Each session takes place during the school day in one of Ascend's Learning Stations \u2014 immersive, student - centered learning environments in the school building that empower students to take ownership over their learning. The role of the Learning Coach is critical to Ascend's success. Learning Coaches serve as individualization experts; they develop deep relationships with Ascend students, getting to know the ins -and-outs of who they are not only as learners, but also as complex human beings with a range of social -emot ional needs. Ascend's math instruction is about more than teaching discrete skills; rather, it serves as a vehicle for instilling in students the strategies of lifelong learners. For these reasons and more, the training and development of our Learning Coac hes is pivotal. Learning Coaches are paired with Ascend's instructional coaches, who provide consistent support and feedback. On a weekly basis, Learning Coaches receive one -on-one, virtual coaching and training on a remote learning platform from this team of seasoned, expert teachers, with a focus on instructional coaching and analysis of student understanding, which informs task planning and learning progressions. Learning Coaches record and upload all Learning Sessions to Ascend's virtual, video analysis portal; Learning Coaches and instructional coaches systematically analyze these video sessions and assess key program data. This rigorous process is what allows Ascend to individualize at high levels. Ascend has demonstrated significant academic results with its early student cohorts. Over the course of one school year, 100% of students in Ascend's fourth grade cohort went from scoring in the bottom two tiers in math (\"limited\" and \"basic\") to achieving grade -level proficiency on state standardized testi ng -- as compared to only 50% of non -Ascend students who started in the same low -scoring group. The Delivery of Innovative, 1:1 Remote Learning: Implementation & Scale The onset of COVID -19 has accelerated the implementation of Phase 2 of Ascend's pilot initiative: the delivery of 1:1, live online instruction during the school day. Ascend is the first PR/Award # S425B200035 Page e118 2 initiative of its kind to deliver individualized, 1:1 mathematics and social -emotional learning curriculum that is specifically tailored to meet the unique needs of low -performing students in urban public schools through immersive, remote learning stations within the school building and community -based institutions. The digital educational tools available today often fail to provide the level of individualiz ation required to enable persistently low -performing students to master subject area standard s. The market offers tools that can adapt content to provide opportunity for students on the cusp of fluency to practice specific skills. However, these platforms cannot sufficiently individualize instruction to: 1) address specific conceptual gaps that may impede a given student's ability to practice, 2) provide in -the-moment instruction required to maximize and accelerate learning based on an individual student's current level of understanding , and 3) overcome the complex, social -emotional barriers that can impede a child's ability to learn. Moreover, there is little evidence -based research on improving outcomes among the bottom 20% of K -12 students in math instruc tion. Ascend's live online instruction model aims to fill an important gap in existing knowledge by examining the discrete factors that yield successful (and unsuccessful) learning outcomes among this population. Specifically, Ascend will contribute to cur rent research and innovative practices in remote learning through the development and analysis of: a) a math curricular approach customized to student need and classroom instruction, b) instructional and training best practices for online math coaching, an d c) a model for purposeful school integration of an immersive, socio -technical environment for 1:1 learning within the public school setting and community -based institutions. Ascend has been preparing for the implementation of its innovative remote learn ing model since 2017. Ascend's academic and social -emotional curriculum was developed specifically for the delivery of both in -person and live, online instruction to serve the individualized needs of its low - performing student population and has been conti nually iterated upon during the 2019 -2020 school year to adapt to Ascend's remote learning platform. Ascend has begun piloting live online instruction and remote learning platform with current students during the summer of 2020 in preparation for scale of remote learning during the 2020 -2021 school year. Additional funding will afford Ascend the resources necessary to scale and validate this field -initiated, remote learning model at its first demonstration phase site in Cincinnati, in preparation for broade r scale to multiple school sites within both Cincinnati Public Schools and additional, low -performing, urban public school districts within Ohio in partnership with the Ohio Department of Education.
