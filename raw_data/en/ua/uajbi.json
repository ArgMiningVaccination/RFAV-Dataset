Several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, allergy/asthma, and diabetes, are associated with changes in composition of the microbiome. Recent nd- ings suggest novel complex mechanisms by which the microbiome impacts immune cell development and dif- ferentiation. A major implication of these ndings is that the composition of microbiome may ultimately affect vaccine efcacy. We explore here the potential role of the microbiome in vaccine responses in the context of our growing understanding of the relationship between the gastrointestinal microbiota, resident immune cell popu- lations, and systemic immunity. Microbial composition affects the development and function of immune cell populations and vice versa Microbial colonization of the human body begins at birth, and thereafter humans are colonized by what becomes a resident microbiota throughout life. We have coevolved for millions of years with our microbiota in a symbiotic rela- tionship that is mutually benecial (reviewed in [1]). Main- tenance of this symbiotic relationship is essential for health, whereas its disruption leads to a state termed 'dysbiosis' (microbial imbalance) which predisposes the body to disease [2]. Although it has been known for some time that the intestinal resident microbiota are crucial symbionts (see Glossary ) for metabolism and nutrition, mounting evidence suggests a previously unrecognized, mutually benecial relationship based on crosstalk be- tween the microbiota and the immune system, which impacts upon the behavior of both systems [3]. The signi- cance of this crosstalk is most strikingly illustrated in the gastrointestinal tract of germ-free (GF) mice, which exhibit inappropriate organization and function of mucosal im- mune tissues (reviewed in [4]). Colonization of GF mice with the microbiota of conventionally raised mice [specic- pathogen free (SPF) conditions] restores many of these deciencies, validating the requirement of the microbiotafor the development and maturation of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) [5,6]. Other studies have shown that distinct members of the gut microbiota can have a systemic impact by orchestrating the development of spe- cic immune cell compartments [7-11] . In addition, recent experiments have shown that, in some cases, microbial metabolites can impact upon the cellular networks in the gut, offering mechanistic routes by which the microbiomeReview Glossary Enterotype: the classification of humans or of other living organisms with an intestine based on similarities in their gut microbial communities as viewed through multivariate statistical methods. Enteropathy: the presence of any pathology or inflammation in the intestine. Mucosal vaccine: immunization through oral, nasal or vaginal routes. Parenteral vaccine: vaccines administered through a non-mucosal surface (intravenous, intramuscular etc.). Pathobionts: symbionts that are able to cause disease when the environmental conditions are altered. Probiotics: viable non-pathogenic microorganisms that confer health benefits by augmenting the activities of commensal microorganisms in the gut. Examples of these activities include biosynthesis of vitamin K, fermentation of indigestible dietary fiber, and competition with pathogenic microorganism for nutrients, among others. Probiotics can modulate the host immune response directly through interaction with intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) or immune cells in the gut, or indirectly through the modulation of the intestinal microbiota. The immunomodulatory effects of probiotics seem to be microbe species- and strain-specific. The most important benefit of probiotics is likely the maintenance of gut homeostasis (sustaining a balanced and beneficial flora). Currently, the most common species of probiotics used are Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species. Prebiotics: non-digestible dietary supplements (mainly fiber/carbohydrates) that also offer benefit to the host by selectively stimulating the growth of particular species of bacteria (mainly Bifidobacterium ). Oligofructoses are naturally occurring plant carbohydrates, consisting of fructose polymers and a terminal glucose molecule, and combined with other prebiotics show positive effects. The most extensively used prebiotics are fructans such as inulin, fructo-oligosachar- ides, and galacto-oligosaccharides. Because they are indigestible in the small intestine, they are fermented anaerobically in the colon to produce short-chain fatty acids (such as acetate, proprionate, and butyrate) that have been shown to modulate IEC function and favor the growth of other microbiota. Symbionts: organisms that live in a state of symbiosis - a state in which at least two different organisms reside in a niche and closely associate to the benefit of each organism in the interaction. Vaccine adjuvants: substances added to the vaccine which can increase the systemic and local immune response to the particular vaccine. Vaccine efficacy: defined as the percentage reduction of disease incidence in a vaccinated group compared to an unvaccinated group. The vaccine efficacy is measured by double-blinded clinical trial, thereby measuring the 'best-case scenario' under strict and controlled conditions. It is very important to assess the safety of each new vaccine and rigorous assessment is required before regulatory authorities can license a vaccine. Vaccine effectiveness: a measure of the ability of the vaccine to prevent disease in the 'real world'. Vaccine effectiveness is proportional to the vaccine efficacy, but is influenced primarily by how well the target groups are immunized. Many factors can influence vaccine effectiveness, including the population immunized (age, prior exposure, genetic make-up etc.) and vaccine characteristics (mode of delivery, accessibility, stability etc).1471-4906/ /C223 2014 Elsevier in Immunology, November 2014, Vol. 35, No. 11can guide immune responses. Previously documented microbiota/host immune interactions have been recently received by Kamada et al. [12] and are summarized in Table 1. The immune system also clearly exerts its influence on the microbiota; both innate and adaptive immune compo- nents are modied microbial receptors (TLR) and nucleotide- binding oligomerization domain (NOD) innate immunity receptors is crucial to maintain gut microbial homeostasis [13]. Virtually every mouse decient in these receptors and/or their signaling adaptor proteins (such as MyD88) exhibits altered or dysbiotic microbiota [14] which, in many cases, is sufcient to induce disease [15]. Strikingly, in some cases transfer of this 'dysbiotic microbiota' into wild type hosts is sufcient to transmit disease [16]. Adaptive response effectors, such as secretory immunoglobulin (Ig) A, also have a key impact upon the microbiota. IgA is crucial for compartmentalization of the microbiota to the gut lumen, and IgA-decient mice have increased micro- biota penetration of intestinal barrier and elevated microbe-specic serum IgG [17,18] . The above examples emphasize the symbiotic nature of the intestinal ecosystem in which the microbiota influence many physiological processes in the host while the host provides a nurturing niche for survival of specic microbial communities. Similar examples of this bidirectional mutu- emerging in other mucosal tissues [19]. Collec- tively, this new appreciation of the host and its resident microbial community as a superorganism is changing the way we conceptualize and approach disease and treat- ment. It will be fundamental in designing prevention strategies and impacts directly upon vaccine development, adjuvants, and vaccine responses. In this review we ex- plore the concept that the microbiota either directly orindirectly influence vaccine responses. We discuss the notion that discrepancies in vaccine effectiveness in differ- ent parts of the world could be a consequence of dysbiosis, malnutrition, and overexposure to microorganisms. We summarize recent literature on the impact of probiotics/ prebiotics on vaccine efcacy, and nally we highlight two key articles that study the direct influence of the intestinal microbiota on oral vaccination. Early-life environmental exposures and vaccine responsesThe composition of the intestinal microbiota in each adult remains remarkably stable throughout life at the phylum level and in overall function, as seen through metagenomic analyses [20]. However, in humans this community of microbes does not become stable and mature until about 2 years of age (post-weaning), and several studies have shown the microbial composition prior to this time period is highly variable and sensitive to environmental exposures [20,21] . Thus, children under the age of 2 years are much more susceptible to environment-driven alterations in microbiota composition, and this can have lasting conse- quences on future immune responses. There are three major environmental variables that affect microbiota early in life: diet (breast fed vs formula fed), delivery method (vaginal vs Caesarean section), and hygiene (clean vs unsanitary environment) [22]. Multiple studies have reported signicant reductions of probi- otic microbes Lactobacillus, Streptococcus , are not breast-fed [23,24] . Formula- fed infants, by contrast, have an expansion of Bacteroides species as well as Enterobactericeae (Klebsiella and E. coli, for example) . Although no clinical trials have studied the impact that these exposures may have on oral or parenter- al vaccines, it is likely that these differences in early-lifeTable 1. Immunoregulatory effects of microbiota in the GI tracta. Microbiota species Immune regulation Refs Segmented lamentous bacteria (SFB) Alter T cell subsets in the terminal ileum SFB induce accumulation of Th17 cells in the terminal ileum, through an unknown mechanism. It is hypothesized that SFB induce the production of SAA in the terminal ileum. This protein could act on lamina propria dendritic cells, which in turn stimulate a Th17 cell inducing environment.[86] Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) Direct the development of FoxP3+Tregs in the colon Polysaccharide A (PSA) from B. fragilis mediates conversion of CD4+T cells into Foxp3+ Tregs. This effect is mediated through TLR2 signaling in T cells and not in dendritic cells. PSA-TLR2/C0//C0interaction results in increased secretion of IL-10 by Tregs, and markedly reduces the expansion of Th17 cells in the gut.[87-90] Clostridium cluster IV (C. leptum group) and XIVa (C. group)Promote the expansion of colonic and systemic Tregs Clostridia activate IEC to secrete TGFb and other Treg-inducing molecules such as MMP2, MMP9, MMP13 and IDO, thus increasing the number of Tregs in the colon, but not in the small intestine. Tregs are also increased in the spleen, liver and lungs. Clostridia induction of Tregs seems to be independent of PRR because mice decient for MyD88, Rip2, or Card9 have normal numbers of Tregs in the colon. Clostridia in the gut also seem to affects systemic sites. Low levels of systemic IgE and IL-4, and high levels of IL-10-producing splenocytes, are found in a model of OVA-induced asthma in animals carrying Clostridia.[7,11] Sphingomonas yanoikuyae Modulate the phenotype and response of iNKT cells iNKT cells from GF mice show signicant impairment in antigen-stimulated cytokine responses compared to SPF mice. Oral gavage with S. yanoikuyae could restore the hyporesponsiveness of iNKT from GF mice. This response is independent of TLR and IL-12 stimulation because mice decient in these receptors have similar phenotypic changes.[91] aAbbreviations: Card9, caspase recruitment domain family, inducer of Dectic-1 signaling; IDO, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase; IEC, cells; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; Myd88, myeloid differentiation protein adaptor protein for Toll-like receptors; Rip2, receptor-interacting protein 2 (an adaptor protein for receptors); SAA, serum amyloid A; TGFb, transforming growth factor.Review Trends in Immunology November 2014, Vol. 35, No. 11 527microbiota composition will be reflected in the immune response of the child to vaccines. In regions of the world with poor sanitation, where increased fecal-oral bacterial exposure occurs early in life, there is clear evidence of reduced immunogenicity gener- ated via oral vaccines. For example, an early study showed that serum antibody responses to oral cholera vaccines were more pronounced (>twofold) in children from a west- ernized country with access to proper sanitation, and low infection levels compared to those in a region with poor sanitation and increased enteric disease burden, as assessed in double-blind pediatric trials in Nicaragua and Sweden [25]. Since then, Levine and coworkers have reviewed years of clinical data and concluded that in- creased fecal-oral bacterial exposures dampened immune responses and efcacy of oral cholera vaccines [26]. Simi- larly, there is evidence of poor efcacy of rotavirus vaccines in developing countries with poor sanitation compared to industrialized nations [27-29] . Likewise, in areas of India, responses to an oral polio vaccine correlated with the location of the children tested. Children in poorer regions of Northern India elicited lower mucosal immune responses compared to the rest of India, again likely reflecting access to better sanitation in wealthier regions [30]. Thus, irrespective of whether the vaccine is viral or bacterial, its effectiveness in these resource-poor and un- dernourished settings, where poor sanitation is rampant, is correspondingly poor. Although there may be a nutri- tional component to this phenomenon (discussed in more detail below), it is also likely that it is driven by poor sanitation. For example, studies in Bangladesh have con- rmed that, within populations sharing the same diet, there is wide range of antibody responses to an oral cholera vaccine that cannot be explained solely by nutrient [31,32] . A in children, termed environmental enteropathy (EE), is now suggested to be the main driver of these effects [26,33] . EE is dened as chronic intestinal inflammation, and dysfunction of the small intestinal barrier, indepen- dent of any known infectious etiology [33]. The main features are visible in the small intestine and include villous blunting, increased intestinal permeability, and chronic inflammation, leading to malabsorption and growth stunting even without exposure to diarrheal dis- ease [33]. Immunologically, children with EE have in- of CD8+intraepithelial lymphocytes [34]. The small intestinal microbiota of children with EE is shifted and dysbiotic, likely due to an overgrowth of Gram- negative pathobionts including Klebsiella, E. coli, and Bacteroides [35]. Although the etiology of EE remains unknown, a lead- ing hypothesis is that individuals living in regions with high oral exposures to contaminated water and food are exposed to a larger variety of potentially harmful micro- organisms, resulting in an altered intestinal immune sys- tem and thus altered responses to antigenic challenge, compared to those without these exposures [36]. In support of this hypothesis, there is a signicant difference in T helper (Th)1 cytokine responsiveness to classical TLR agonists in children from poor regions of South Africa as compared to Canadian children [37]. Most strikingly,immune cells in the blood of South African infants aged 2 years are severely hyporesponsive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation and secrete low levels of cytokines in response to TLR4 stimulation compared to age-matched children from Canada [38]. Although the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are unknown, it has been postulated that this is due to differential environmental exposures to TLR ligands in different regions of the world. Because EE presents with small intestinal microbial dys- biosis, barrier defects, and chronic inflammation, oral vaccine antigens may not trigger a protective antibody response to the level of children who present with normal intestinal homeostasis (Figure 1). More studies are neces- sary to reveal the key issues related to EE and oral vaccine blunting, including the etiology of EE in children, which microbes drive the condition, and a better assessment of the immunological environment in the intestine of children with EE symptoms and their response to vaccines. Thus, animal models are sorely needed to facilitate the develop- ment of more efcacious vaccine strategies in populations afflicted with EE. Taken together, early-life environmental exposures, di- et, and sanitation all influence the microbiota composition encountered perinatally. During this time the immune system is plastic and not fully mature. It is not yet clear how this affects downstream vaccine effectiveness. How- ever, in developing countries with poor sanitation, EE may be a major culprit for vaccine failure because it leads to a mucosal immune system that is chronically activated. In this scenario, an oral vaccine may not elicit a response in this population because the immunological function of the small intestinal may be permanently altered due to con- stant microbial penetration of the epithelium and a dys- biotic microbiota. Aside from sanitation, another major driver of microbial composition in these developing country populations is diet. Impact of nutritional status on the microbiota and vaccine effectiveness Malnutrition affects millions of children worldwide and is linked to 1 in 5 deaths in children under the age of 5 years [36,39] . It has been well documented that nutrition can impact upon the function of the mammalian adaptive immune system, and thus the responses to vaccines (reviewed in [40]). Many micronutrients are important for immune function and vaccine effectiveness, including vitamin A and zinc [41,42] . For example, vitamin A de- ciency in mice has been shown to modulate trafcking of vaccine-specic CD8+T cells to the ovalbumin cells [43]. In addition, lack of vitamin A can alter retinoic acid metabolism, leading to altered trafck- ing of dendritic cells (DCs) [44] and class II major histo- compatibility complex (MHC-II) antigen presentation, each of which could affect DC presentation of vaccine antigens [45]. Furthermore, retinoic acid can serve as a cofactor to promote IgA-producing B cells, by synergizing with interleukin (IL-5) secretion by DCs [46]. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have been implicated as primaryReview Trends in Immunology November 2014, Vol. 35, No. 11 528sensors of vitamin A malnutrition because vitamin A deciency depletes IL-22-producing ILC3 cells, but can by ILC2 cells, such as IL-13, which can signal the gut immune system to respond to antigens in a Th2-skewed manner [47]. Many immune transcription factors and processes rely on zinc uptake, and in addition zinc helps to form a protective intestinal barrier against microbes [42]. For example, in zinc-decient mice, serum antibody responses and T cell proliferation were signicantly decreased after vaccination with a parental hepatitis B vaccine [48]. In light of the impact of diet on the composition of the intestinal micro- biome [49], it is likely that prolonged malnutrition signi- cantly alters the microbiome. How these diet-driven changes in the microbiome impact upon vaccine effective- ness is unknown. One hypothesis is that expansion of gut pathobionts and inflammatory mediators in a malnourished host could overwhelm the immune system, leading to a gut ecosystem where vaccine antigens do not elicit robust immune responses as effectively (Figure 1). One study measured the response to a hepatitis B parenteral vaccine in celiac disease patients (noted for their expansion of upper intes- tinal pathobionts) with active or non-active disease, andfound IgG antibody titers against the vaccine were signicantly blunted only during active disease [50], thereby signicantly decreasing the likelihood of a host genetic component. Several recent reports suggest that malnutrition also has a pervasive impact on the composition of the intestinal microbiota, including an expansion of Proteobacteria and decreased growth rate [51]. It was found [52] that protein deciency in mice lacking the protein angiotension-coverting enzyme-2 (ACE2) regulates expres- sion of antimicrobial peptides the small intestine. This in turn affects microbial dysbiosis and predisposes the mice to intestinal inflammation after dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment. ACE2-decient mice lack expression of the neu- tral amino acid transporter BoAT1 in the small intestine, and exhibit markedly reduced serum levels of neutral amino acids including the essential amino acid tryptophan [52]. Transfer of microbiota from ACE2-decient mice to GF mice demonstrated that microbiota composition changes due to malnutrition was sufcient to transfer the inflammatory phenotype to recipient mice [52]. This study provides an example of how the microbiota, nutrition, and the immune system are tightly linked and require homeostasis to func- tion properly. Immunology Figure 1. Intestinal homeostasis can affect vaccine effectiveness. In the small intestine of children with disorders such as environmental enteropathy, microbial dysbiosis can lead to tissue damage and thus to gut inflammation. If the dysbiosis persists, this can lead to chronic gut inflammation where there is an increase in intestinal permeability and a decrease in villous length and enterocyte absorption. Immune cells in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) respond by creating dendritic cell (DC)- mediated T cell and antibody responses to invading microbiota. This leads to a cycle of inflammation, and the influx of proinflammatory cells, decrease in absorption potential, and shift in the immune populations can have an impact upon the host response to oral antigenic challenge. In this case, microbial translocation leads to an increase in DCs with antigens from the microbiota, and this may dampen the immunogenicity of a vaccine antigen because the immune system is preoccupied with preventing a systemic microbial breach of the intestine. Many oral vaccine antigens are microbial in nature, thus cross-presentation of microbiota antigens in chronic inflammation could affect the downstream antibody responses to the vaccine.Review Trends in Immunology November 2014, Vol. 35, No. 11 529microbiota and nutrition, future studies on vaccine responses should also assess microbiota composition be- cause its composition can predispose a host to intestinal damage and immune defects that are negatively correlated to vaccine outcome. Impact of probiotics and prebiotics on vaccine responsesThere is evidence that probiotics exert immunomodulatory effects in both in vitro systems and animal models (reviewed in [53]). Thus, an array of nutritional interven- tions using probiotics have been examined for their effects on vaccine responses in human populations (reviewed in [54-56] ). Examples of these studies performed in humans are summarized in the Table 2. The rationale behind the use of probiotics, prebiotics, or a combination of the two for vaccine delivery is that they may improve vaccine efcacy by appropriately stimulating the immune system (adju- vant effect). However, the mechanisms behind the pro- posed benecial effects of probiotics in vaccination remain unknown. Although some of these studies report signicant increases in vaccine-specic antibodies [57-60] , the majority show modest or no effect of probiotics in providing major enhancement of antibody responses to vaccines [61-65] . Moreover, the outcomes of these studies are highly dependent on experimental conditions including strain and dose of probiotics, type of vaccine, and popula- tion studied. Overall, owing to the inconsistency of these results, the clinical relevance of the effect of probiotics on vaccine efcacy in human populations remains undened. Vaccine-specic serum antibody titers are used as a surrogate measure of vaccine efcacy. Although many studies have shown a trend towards increased serum antibodies after administration of probiotics, these are not signicantly higher than those obtained in placebo controls [62,66] . In addition, some probiotic formulations have demonstrated specic effects for one vaccine but not for others. For example, in a study performed in Finland [61], the diet of pregnant mothers was supplemented with a mixture of four probiotics during the last month of pregnancy (summarized in Table 2). After birth, infants received the same mix of probiotics and syrup containing 0.8 g of galacto-oligosaccharides once a day for 6 months. The infants were immunized at ages 3, 4, and 5 months with a triple diphtheria, tetanus, and Haemophilus influ- enzae type b (Hib) vaccine. Serum samples were analyzed at 6 months of age. The probiotic group exhibited a higher frequency of Hib-specic IgG compared to the placebo group. However, no differences in levels of IgG specic for diphtheria or tetanus were observed in probiotic group compared to placebo controls [61]. These differences sug- gest that probiotic formulations may improve responses to a particular vaccine but not to others. Indeed, it seems that the effects of probiotics are highly specic. For example, in a study performed in USA [57], healthy adults were given Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) twice daily or placebo for 28 days post-vaccination with trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine containing an H1N1 resembling that of the 2007-2008 strain, an H3N2-like strain, and a B-like strain. Serum samples analyzed at day 28 for antibody titers against each vaccine component showed a signicantincrease in H3N2-specic IgG levels in the probiotic group versus the placebo control group. However, no difference in IgG levels specic for the H1N1 or B strains were observed at the same time-point. The above examples illustrate the complexity of the effects of probiotics of vaccine responses. Recent studies using animal models highlight the com- plexity of the immune mechanisms that confer protection during vaccination and their modulation through interven- tion with probiotics. Chattha et al. [67] studied the effect of rotavirus vaccines on T cell responses in gnotobiotic piglets colonized with a mixture of LGG and Bidobacterium lactis Bb12 and vaccinated orally with attenuated human rota- virus. Treatment with probiotics resulted in higher serum levels of T helper 1 (Th1) cytokines such as interferon g (IFN- g) and IL-12, and reduced levels of Th2 cytokines (IL- 4); these cytokine levels correlated with reduced severity of diarrhea and reduced virus shedding upon challenge with virulent rotavirus. Interestingly, increased levels of intes- tinal T regulatory cells (Tregs) were found in the probiotic group, suggesting that disease protection could be mediat- ed not only by the Th1 response but also by regulatory responses necessary to restore gut homeostasis and reduce inflammation. In summary, there is evidence that probio- tics may serve not only as adjuvants for particular types of vaccines but also as facilitators of a return to tissue ho- meostasis following pathogen challenge. The dosage of probiotics may also exert an effect. For example, a study was designed to evaluate the effect of the dose of the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus and responses to oral rotavirus vaccines [68]. Gnotobiotic pig- lets were administered daily probiotics with a high dose (maximum dose 1 /C2 109), low dose (maximum dose 1 /C2 106), or no probiotic. The piglets were then immunized orally with attenuated human rotavirus vaccine at days 5 and 15 of probiotic treatment. A low dose of probiotic promoted higher IFN- g production by CD4+and CD8+T cells in the intestine, in systemic sites, and in the blood, whereas high doses of the same probiotic increased intes- tinal and systemic Tregs. To examine the vaccine protec- tive effects under the various doses of probiotics, the authors challenged the piglets with a virulent human rotavirus strain. They monitored clinical signs, virus shed- ding, and diarrhea for 7 days. Neither dose of LGG signi- cantly enhanced protection conferred by the vaccine against rotavirus diarrhea. Thus, different doses of the same probiotic can influence distinct T cells responses induced by rotavirus vaccine. These ndings may help to explain some of the controversies regarding supplementa- tion with the same probiotics and the differential outcomes reported using similar formulations with different doses [69]. Thus, to validate probiotics in human trials, a better selection of the strain and dose of probiotics may help to promote better outcomes in vaccine effectiveness. Only a few studies have evaluated the effect of prebiotics on vaccine responses. Similarly to probiotics, divergent conclusions have been reported, perhaps reflecting differ- ences in methodology, use of different prebiotics, different timing of supplementation, etc. Some formulations of pre- biotics have shown positive effects in animal models.

Study performed in JapanNo signicant difference was observed in innate immune response between the probiotics and placebo control groups. There was a trend towards higher vaccine antibody responses in the probiotic vs placebo group[93]Review Trends in Immunology November 2014, Vol. 35, No. 11 532(scGOS/lcFOS) (ratio pectin-derived acidic oli- gosaccharides (pAOS). 8 post-vaccination) increased vaccine-specic delayed-type hypersensitivity. By con- trast, no signicant effect was observed when the supple- mentation started at later time-points. Thus, the timing of prebiotic supplementation appears to be crucial for achieving improved immunomodulatory effects in vacci- nation interventions. In contrast to data derived from animal models, the results from human studies using prebiotics and vaccines have not been encouraging. This is exemplied by a mul- tinational study in Western Europe [72] in which the effect of adding a prebiotic mix (scGOS/lcFOS) and (pAOS) on specic vaccine responses to Hib and tetanus immuniza- tion was evaluated. The prebiotic mix was added to for- mula of healthy infants during the rst year of life. No differences were found in IgG responses to Hib and teta- nus vaccines between infants with or without prebiotic supplementation. Similar results were obtained in an independent study in shantytowns in Peru [73] that eval- uated the effects of dietary supplementation with the prebiotic oligofructose on the prevalence of diarrhea and responses to immunization with Hib in infants (6-12 months). Blood samples obtained before immunization with Hib (/C245-6 months) and 1 month post-vaccination failed to show an effect of the oligofructose prebiotic on antibody responses to Hib vaccination. Likewise, they failed to show any effect on the prevalence of diarrhea or other infections. Although the authors argued that the lack of a prebiotic effect could reflect the fact that breast milk already contains high concentrations of oligosacchar- ides, a previously described Western European study [72] failed to show an effect of prebiotics in infants fed with formula. Finally, a Dutch study aimed at evaluating the effect of prebiotics (scGOS/lcFOS) on vaccine responses in preterm infants failed to show an effect of prebiotics on vaccine responses to Diphtheria, tetanus, pertusis, polio, and Hib (DTaP-IPV-Hib) [74]. Although diet (breast or formula feeding) was not taken into account in correlating vaccine-specic antibody responses, both groups (scGOS/ lcFOS and placebo) contained similar numbers of breast- fed infants. Collectively the data suggest that, irrespective of socio- economic status or diet, prebiotics fail to show a positive effect on vaccine effectiveness in human (although no adverse effects were detected either). It is interesting, however, that the same prebiotic supplementation (scGOS/FOS 9:1) was shown to be protective against atopy because it could modulate protective immune response in infants at risk for allergy by reducing IgE levels and lowering the incidence of atopic dermatitis [75]. Similarly, this formulation protects infants with a parental history of atopy from all types of infections including upper respira- tory infections and allergic disease [76-78] . Thus, in the absence of an effect of prebiotics on vaccine response, they may still be protective in other immune-mediated diseases, and in particular atopy. It is possible that the microbiota and/or the immune response are selectively altered in infants at high risk for atopy, and this can be modulated through prebiotic interventions.Taken together, numerous studies have measured anti- body titers post-administration of certain probiotics or prebiotics, but these show signicant discrepancies that may reflect the type and dose of probiotic/prebiotic admin- istered, the characteristics of the population studied (eth- nicity, age of participants, socio-economic status etc.), duration of the interventions, type of vaccine analyzed (parenteral vs mucosal), or other differences in the vaccine schedules utilized in different countries. Influence of intestinal microbial diversity on vaccine responses Many factors influence vaccine effectiveness, including nutrition, age, sex, and genetics, (reviewed in [79-81] ). However, as noted above, studies correlating intestinal microbiota and its direct influence on vaccine efcacy have been sparse [82] and sometimes discrepant (e.g., supple- mentation with probiotics/prebiotics) [54]. A few studies have begun to address whether a particular microbial community composition is associated with differential vac- cine responses. For example, in a recent study human volunteers were vaccinated orally with a live attenuated Salmonella Typhi (Ty21a) vaccine [83]. Vaccination did not disrupt the composition, diversity, or stability of the mi- crobial community. Vaccine-specic responses were assessed by measuring IFN- g in CD8+T cells in blood and serum IgG and IgA titers against S. Typhi LPS. Only six individuals who received full doses of Ty21a vaccine were included in the analyses, and four unvaccinated served as controls. Four of the six vaccinated individuals exhibited increased CD8+IFN- g responses to vaccination. Interestingly, three of these individuals harbored greater community richness and diversity of their microbiota com- pared with vaccinated individuals showing lower CD8+ IFN- g (n = 2). Analyses of specic bacterial OTUs that could discriminate between high and low IFN- g-producing individuals revealed more abundant Clostridiales in high IFN- g-producing individuals. Overall, the authors specu- lated that vaccine efcacy could potentially be related to the composition of the resident commensal community. This is the rst study to make a direct link between microbiota composition and vaccine responses. In a related study by the same group, Macaques of different geographic origins (with distinct genetic make- up and a different MHC allele repertoire) were candidates [84]. Protection was eval- uated by response to subsequent challenge with wild type S. dysenteriae. Three types of immunizations were per- formed - group 1, vaccinations at days 0 and 28 with candidate 1 (n = 6) and challenge at day 56; group 2, vaccinations days 0 and 28 with candidate 2 (n = 6) and challenge at day 56; group 3, vaccination at days 0, 2, 4, and 7 (n = 6) and challenge at day 28. Controls for each group received saline. Analysis of bacterial communities in feces showed distinct community types in macaques (enterotypes) and, similarly to the previous study, a high level of diversity in the intestinal microbial composition of the macaques correlated with improved protection upon challenge with virulent S. dysenteriae . The authors also found that the macaque microbial communities changedReview Trends in Immunology November 2014, Vol. 35, No. 11 533during immunization and challenge with virulent S. dys- enteriae . Interestingly, macaques that harbored a higher microbial diversity exhibited a more stable microbial community following vaccination and challenge, and this correlated with reduced clinical symptoms of shigellosis. Thus, a more diverse intestinal microbiota may play a protective role in response to enteric pathogens. It is known that enteric pathogens disturb the microbiota to colonize the same niche occupied by commensals [85]. Correspondingly, a more stable microbiome can more effectively resist changes caused by enteropathogens. Studies on the association between the microbiota and vaccine-specic IgG and IgA showed a positive correlation between antibody levels and some microbiota genera. For example, there was a positive correlation with Oscillos- pira and a negative correlation with Streptococcus in protective responses. Although many factors such asvaccine regimen (different vaccine strain used) and the different gut bacterial communities of the macaques be- fore the intervention prevent wider comparison, this nd- ing suggests that particular microbiome compositions could influence antibody responses. The above vaccine studies are the rst to use DNA sequence analysis to dene the composition of the intestinal microbial communities and correlate these with vaccine- specic responses. The ndings suggest that a more diverse intestinal microbiota fosters a more protective immune response to oral vaccines against intestinal pathogens. This highlights the importance of addressing the composition of the intestinal microbiota in human vaccine trials and may help to explain why vaccine trials show considerable dis- crepancies in different parts of the world [82].

Scheme illustrating how the microbiota may influence vaccine responses. Numerous studies have shown an interconnection between the intestinal microbiota and the immune response. This mutualistic relationship is bidirectional in that the intestinal flora influences immune system function, and the immune system in turn modulates microbial diversity. Ideally, an effective vaccine preparation will elicit an immune response against the agent administered. We suggest that microbiota composition and diversity modulate the immune response to vaccines.Review Trends in Immunology November 2014, Vol. 35, No. 11 534microbiome composition in these types of trials should no longer be an impediment, although interpreting the results remains a challenge. Concluding remarks and outstanding questions We have come to appreciate that the microbiome and host immune responses (especially early in life) are tightly linked. Given that vaccines require immune responses, one may infer that the microbiota is likely to influence vaccine responses. Moreover, studies suggest that the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota may influ- ence the efcacy of oral vaccines. Given all this, the failure to develop protective immunity to vaccines in particular geographical areas could be due to microbial composition (Figure 2). Unfortunately, only a very small number of studies have directly addressed vaccine responses and microbiota composition. There is a real need for a mecha- nistic understanding of the role of microbiota in immune function, and to relate the composition of microbiota and/or specic microbial communities to responses to oral and parenteral vaccines. Hopefully, ongoing large-scale vacci- nation campaigns that are already in place can be exploited to evaluate the link between microbiome composition and vaccine effectiveness. For instance, the influenza vaccine could provide an excellent research model for this type of analysis. As in the studies with probiotic supplementation (although the composition of the microbial diversity post- supplementation was not evaluated), yearly flu vaccine campaigns could provide useful yearly data. Similarly, studies correlating the use of antibiotics (that cause a major effect on microbial diversity) before vaccination, followed by analysis of vaccine-specic responses, would provide major insights into changes in the microbiota and vaccine responses. It is well known that oral vaccines are not as effective in regions of the world where malnutrition is prevalent, and there is a broad push to improve vaccine responses in these populations. The low responses could reflect prior exposure to pathogens or be due to differences in microbiota compo- sition as a result of environmental and nutritional differ- ences. Dietary interventions alone are unlikely to improve vaccine responses in malnourished populations to an ac- ceptable level for efcacy. Therefore, further understand- ing the impact of the intestinal microbiota on vaccine effectiveness in situations of malnutrition would be rst step towards improving the efcacy of vaccines worldwide. Likewise, in individuals with dysbiosis or 'leaky gut', such as celiac disease or type I diabetes, nature is providing us with natural hosts with altered gut immune status that could be exploited to measure vaccine responses. Given the central role that microbiota have on immune system de- velopment, it is a natural extension that the microbiota will impact upon vaccine efcacy. However, there is little actual data thus far. Moreover, the few studies carried out have been limited to general changes in microbiota com- munities. What is needed is a detailed analysis of the role of particular species within communities and their corre- lation with vaccine responses. Given the difculty in den- ing a healthy microbiome, it makes it all the more challenging to dene an optimal microbiome for a particu- lar vaccine to generate its desired effects. However, thetools are now readily available (community sequencing, metagenomics, metabolomics, bioinformatics, etc.), and they will begin to provide the necessary answers. It is not hard to conceive of a future where microbiota composition is analyzed before vaccine administration and, if necessary, altered or a particular microbiota molecule added to ensure an optimal vaccine response. Similarly, adjuvants could include particular microbiota-derived immune-modulating molecules. The ever-expanding information on how the microbiota shapes the immune system will have a profound impact on the future of vaccines, requiring a major shift in our current approach to vaccine development.
