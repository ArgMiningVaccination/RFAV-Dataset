Perhaps the oldest system of medicine, Ayurveda is a holistic science of balance and health.

Ashwagandha has calming effect on the body of the dog in the case of stressful situations. 2) Turmeric In Ayurvedic tradition, turmeric is a general tonic and blood pacifier. A potent anti-inflammatory agent with pain relieving properties. Turmeric also possesses anti-asthmatic, antioxidant, hepatoprotective (prevent damage to the liver) and anti-cancer activity. It is also known to have strong anti-ulcer activity due to its strong immune modulation and immune-stimulant properties, thus making it very effective in IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Diseases) cases. It Also has neuroprotective properties, so many local neurologists use it for spinal injury and inflammation. 3) Amla Each amla fruit contains up to 700mg of vitamin C. This natural ascorbate is synergistically enhanced by the bioflavonoids and polyphenols contained in each fruit. The many beneficial properties of amla result not only from its abundance of Vitamin C, bioflavonoids and polyphenols, but also from its concentration of other nutrients. Amla contains substantial amounts of vitamin E, beta carotene, gallic acid, and ellagic acid (natural antioxidants); in addition it also lists niacin, calcium and other trace minerals, carbohydrates, proteins, and a minute amount of fat as part of its nutritional profile.

Centuries of use and many recent studies show it to be a safe and effective medicinal herb.
