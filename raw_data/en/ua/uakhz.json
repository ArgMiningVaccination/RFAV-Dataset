According to Duke perinatologist [Geeta Swamy, MD,](/find-doctors-physicians/geeta-k-swamy-md) the annual immunization offers three layers of protection for you, your fetus, and your baby. Flu season typically lasts from October through April. Protecting You and Your Child Pregnant people aren't at higher risk for getting the flu, but they are more likely to suffer serious complications because of it. According to Dr. Swamy, pregnant people have a greater risk of being hospitalized and have higher rates of pneumonia and respiratory complications because of the flu. Protect yourself by getting vaccinated against the flu. Protecting yourself from getting the flu by getting vaccinated is also important because it protects your fetus. Getting the flu during pregnancy puts the developing fetus at risk for complications such as preterm delivery and low birth weight. \"Even if mom is fine, evidence suggests influenza exposure can lead to medical problems that include psychiatric disorders in the baby's future,\" explained Dr. Swamy, a nationally recognized expert on immunizations during pregnancy.

They include vaccinations against COVID-19 and pertussis (Tdap), also known as \"whooping cough.\" It's safe to receive all three vaccines, even on the same day. Since no immunization is perfect, pregnant people who've been vaccinated against the flu should still take precautions. If you think you've been exposed to the flu, your doctor can offer prophylactic treatment with anti-viral medications.
