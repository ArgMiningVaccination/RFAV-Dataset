We might diffuse a relaxing scent, get a massage, or incorporate more medicinal plants into our diet. But of all the five senses, hearing is typically not our first priority. Yet, we notice when a jackhammer outside our window heightens our stress or when the familiar sound of a lullaby our parent sung to soothe us as a baby instantly calms us. Recognizing the transformative power of sound, it's no surprise then that [sound healing](https://introspectivemarketresearch.com/reports/sound-therapy-market/) is booming in the wellness space. \"Our relationship with technology has created an environment where the greatest challenges to wellness are more mental than physical,\" says Jeremy McCarthy, Group Director of Spa and Wellness at [Mandarin Oriental](https://www.mandarinoriental.com/en/), in an interview. \"And people have been turning to music and sound therapies to help alleviate their stress and [anxiety](https://www.forbes.com/health/mind/what-is-anxiety/).\" The luxury hotel brand recently launched their 'Wellness Music Programme' in response to the demand. But the use of music and sound as medicine is in fact [not new](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)62251-9/fulltext#:~:text=The%20oldest%20example%20of%20the,in%20frescos%20from%204000%20BCE.) at all. Harp-playing priests and musicians appear in frescos from 4000 BCE while the discovery of simple flute-light instruments among the remains of Neanderthals suggests music dates back to prehistoric times. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Chinese character for ' [medicine'](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Chinese-character-for-medicine_fig2_324698500) is a combination of the characters for 'music' and 'grass,' suggesting music and herbs were traditionally considered essential components of medicine. In the ancient Chinese text, [\"Ru Men Shi Qin](https://curiosity.lib.harvard.edu/chinese-rare-books/catalog/49-990078865320203941)\" (1228 CE), Zhang Zihe, a renowned Chinese doctor in the Yuan Dynasty advocated for the incorporation of music into medicine after witnessing the remarkable effect of having musicians play the Chinese flute and sing while he performed acupuncture on his patients. The Chinese fable is one of many that highlight the historic importance of music in nourishing the mind and body. Music was so revered in traditional Chinese medicine, that an entire music therapy was created over 2000 years ago known as ' [Five Phases Music Therapy](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=81366#:~:text=Five%20Phases%20Music%20Therapy%20(FPMT)%20employs%20the%20theory%20of%20five,and%20treat%20mind%2Dbody%20illness.).' Unlike western music, ancient Chinese music consists of only five notes: gong (do), shang (ri), jue (mi), zhi (so) and yu (la), which correspond to the five elements of earth, metal, wood, fire and water, respectively. Each of the five scales is also connected to the five main organs of the human body (heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney), and thus was used either in isolation or in combination with another tone to treat whichever part of the body was ailing. Now, this ancient treatment model is being brought into modern wellness by the Mandarin Oriental. Honoring the hotel brand's Asian heritage, each spa has traditionally played their 'Oriental Heritage' playlist, which features music with low frequencies meant to harmonize the body and mind. But their latest 'Wellness Music Programme' takes a more targeted approach with five playlists created in collaboration with MusicStyling, a network of world-renowned ambient composers. \"We can see from looking at cultures and traditions where music played a prominent role in healing that there are certain types of tonality, rhythm and instrumentation that are more commonly used,\" says McCarthy. \"We worked with music experts at MusicStyling to help us curate our playlists along these lines.\" More specifically, each of the five music playlists draws inspiration from each of the scales of 'Five Phases Music Therapy.' The 'Reflect - Winter' playlist, for example, uses struck instruments and free reed pipes to create a soft, gentle sound meant to encourage pause and reflection as the playlist representing 'yu,' the tone which corresponds to the kidney and bladder, and the element of water. Metal instruments such as chimes and singing bowls are used for the tone representing metal\u2014'shang.' As the scale associated with the lung and large intestine, the playlist titled 'Release - Autumn' is meant to prompt a deep exhalation in order to let go with its powerful sonorous sound. 'Zhi,' which corresponds to the element of fire and is associated with the heart and small intestine, serves as the inspiration for the 'Bloom - Summer' playlist designed to represent our capacity for love and encourage the opening of the heart with its flowing, melodious sound created by guqin and other silk string instruments. With such distinctive sounds and purposes, the playlists provide guests an opportunity to tailor their treatment to their specific needs and wellness goals. If they found the music particularly effective during their spa service, they can take their personalized playlist home with them via whichever streaming service they use. While hotel spas race to develop the latest wellness innovation in hopes of attracting guests over their competitors, the Mandarin looks back, rather than forward, to ancient Chinese approaches to wellness. \"We experience the world through our senses so it is only natural that when we consider our wellness offerings that we think about how we impact the wellbeing of our guests through all our sensory channels,\" says McCarthy. With our overlooked sense of hearing having the potential to completely change our mental state, something as simple as swapping out the generic spa music can be transformative. If you can't make it to a Mandarin spa, you can experience the therapeutic benefits of music at home by listening to their spa album or [Yogathletix](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7GRJkBOY35ejyWl7pGVvb0?si=2f19a3c2fc4843b2)'s restorative class soundtrack.
