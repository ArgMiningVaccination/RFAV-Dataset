The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:20 a.m. in room216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Harry Reid [acting chair-man of the Committee] presiding. Present: Senators Reid, Cohen, Grassley, Burns, and Pressler,and Pryor [via satellite]. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR HARRY REID, ACTING CHAIRMAN Senator REID. Good morning everyone. Welcome this morning to this hearing of the Special Committeeon Aging. We are meeting to consider a topic never before directlyraised by Congress: The therapeutic value of music. Some may ask, and have asked, and justifiably so, what is so im-portant about music? Isn't it simply entertainment or recreation?In fact, today's witnesses will tell us that music can work like med-icine. Simply put, music can heal people. Music is not only therapeutic, it is inexpensive. Government does not have a lot of money to spare these days fornew programs. Whenever a worthy solution is offered for a majorproblem, someone always interrupts, \"How much is it going tocost?\" Music therapy is an innovative approach that won't widenthe deficit, but can help millions of older Americans live happier,more fulfilling lives. And we really can get these impressive re-sults, as the saying goes, \"for a song.\" Before I complete my opening statement, though, I am pleasedthat we will have with us this morning the full chairman of thisSpecial Committee on Aging. He will talk to us today via satellitefrom his office in Little Rock, AR. Incidentally, this is the firsttime in Senate history that a Senator makes an opening statementbefore a committee by satellite. Senator David Pryor, who is widely recognized as one of the Na-tion's foremost leaders on issues of concern to the elderly, suffereda heart attack earlier this year. He has been sorely missed by all ofus. We are pleased to have the chairman participate this morning.Hello, David. (1)2 STATEMENT OF SENATOR DAVID PRYOR CHAIRMAN (VIA SATELLITE) Senator PRYOR. Harry, good morning to you. I'm standing in front of the Federal Building in Little Rock, AR. The temperature here today is expected to be at 102 degrees, so al- ready this morning it is getting rather hot. We have just had the State bird with us-I'm sorry he left. The mockingbird has been with us this morning here out in front of the Federal Building. We thought for the benefit of all those in the au- dience we'd give a little free concert here and, while talking about music, I thought we'd talk about the contributions the mocking- bird has made. It has now been about 3 months since I have been in Washing- ton, as Senator Reid has said. Harry has been just wonderful to chair the hearings. He and his staff are doing a wonderful job. We want to thank you all, and owe your people, and all your staff people, a debt of gratitude for the preparation. We want to make certain that this hearing is the first of its kind. We are going to explore some pioneer territory this morning in Washington. The witnesses that you have assembled for this hearing are going to be those witnesses with a great deal of hands-on experience and real day-to-day living with those individuals with Alzheimer's, stroke, and with other disease and illness, where the music has played and can play such a critical and important role. A wonderful panel has come from a long way, from across the country to attend this unique hearing this morning. We want to thank everyone for your participation. Once again, I am reminded, through my own experience, that it is not just exercise and it is not just changing your lifestyle, it is not just hospitals and good doctors and g9od nurses and good friends, but it is something else that we must have and that we are looking for constantly in the system of health care delivery. When we turn to music, we think music can do it. It is playing a very critical new and expanded role in not only providing for the psychological and emotional aspects of being sick or being old or having Alzheimer's, but also to trigger good memories and to trig- ger positive and constructive thoughts. Let me turn this back over to Harry, once again thanking our panel. I'm sorry I couldn't be there. I will be watching the video, listening to the witnesses, and hearing all of what you have to say. Thank you once again. Have a good time. Learn a lot. You're going to share some experiences. Thank you very much. Senator REID. Thank you, David. We will hear that for many older Americans music can increase alertness, physical vigor, and their capacity to continue meaningful relationships. Thousands of older Americans and those with dis- abilities are learning that music therapy improves their lives. They find it reaches further than traditional medications. According to 90-year-old Ida Goldman, who is seated before me, \"Music is better than medicine.\" Like medicine, music must be used properly to get results. This simple idea has been recognized for thousands of years.3 Sir Francis Bacon explained to the King of England in the 17thcentury: The poets did well to conjoin music and medicine because the office of medicine isbut to tune this curious harp of man's body and to reduce it to harmony. Today we can use scientific methods to examine and define howto use music as medicine. This hearing will document the currentstate of research in this relatively new field of scientific inquiry.We will also hear from people who have had remarkable experi-ences with music therapy. You may wonder, \"What is music therapy?\" We don't oftenthink of music as something used in a clinic. Yet, there are 5,000certified music therapists across the country, some of whom arewith us here today. They use carefully selected musical activities inhospitals, nursing homes, senior centers, rehabilitation centers, andother institutions. These therapists are well trained to assess peo-ple's needs and to apply the right activities to improve their physi-cal, mental, or emotional lives. Witnesses today will testify that Alzheimer's patients who havelost the ability to talk or to relate to their loved ones can still singor dance. I know this because a former staffer of mine, DanaGentry, has a grandmother in Las Vegas who suffers from Alzhei-mer's. Dana tells me she mumbles incoherently, and doesn't evenknow she is in a nursing home. But something special happenswith music. I'd like to read to you from a letter that Dana wrote tome last week: I love Grandma deeply and feel robbed by whatever demon has stolen her mind.Reaching back through the years I thought of the times when she held me in herarms and sang to me. Kneeling beside her wheelchair, I sang 'our song' directly intoher ear. At first it was just a slight glimmer of recognition that I noticed on her face. Iwas thrilled by that. And then she joined in. She sang the entire song, every word,and in harmony. And in the end, as tears rolled down my cheeks, she cried too, asif, for the moment, she realized her accomplishment.We sing at every visit now. Sometimes when she sings I have her back, if only tillthe end of the song. Dana's story illustrates a point. No, music cannot cure Alzhei-mer's victims, but new research demonstrates it can keep theirminds awake and lift a veil of sadness from their families.Dr. Oliver Sacks will tell us of \"awakenings\" that occur frommusic in Parkinson's and other neurologically afflicted patients.The film \"Awakenings,\" based on Dr. Sacks' book, delivers thismessage, one that deserves our attention.Dr. Sacks, I watched your movie last Saturday with my family,and it was a hit. Two of America's top performers will give us their perspective onmusic's potential as a healing tool. Mickey Hart, drummer for theGrateful Dead for the past 25 years, and author of a recent book onthe history of drumming, will share his insight. Theodore Bikel, astar on Broadway and in motion pictures, as well as a fabulous folksinger-that's where I first heard Theodore Bikel-will explainhow music can keep us vibrant at any age.Today's hearing raises a question: Do we need further researchinto music therapy? I think we do, because early evidence indicatesthat it serves those suffering from Alzheimer's disease and related4 dementias, strokes, depression, and other disabling conditions. Music therapy is a new field that shows great promise. Older per- sons may well benefit from further research. Healthy older persons can also benefit from music. Dr. Frank Wilson will explain that older persons can learn to make music at any time in life. In fact, learning to play an instrument can keep older persons alert and creative. Music has a positive impact on many people, from those in the best of health to those with severe neurological disorders. The Fed- eral Government's concern is with those who are most vulnerable. Elderly and disabled individuals deserve Congress' attention. Con- gress can also remind our older citizens that learning music has re- wards at any age. The goal of this hearing is to discover what is known about music's role in the survival of human vitality. We will learn that music helps all types of people to remain \"forever young.\" Senator REID. Senator Cohen. STATEMENT OF SENATOR WILLIAM COHEN Senator COHEN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. As members of the audience may have detected, these beepers that are going off have just announced that a vote is underway, so I'm going to be very brief in my comments. I'd like to extend my congratulations to Senator Pryor. This is the first time I have seen him since his heart attack. We have been reading about him in articles authored by him telling of his experi- ence and some of the lessons he has learned in going through that traumatic experience of suffering a major heart attack. Mr. Chairman, you mentioned the poets. I remember reading Shakespeare, who said that \"Music can minister to minds diseased, pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow, raise out the written trou- bles of the brain, and with its sweet, oblivious antidote, cleanse the full bosom of all perilous stuff which weighs upon the heart.\" So I think that poets for years and years have recognized the impor- tance of music to the spirit. Mrs. Goldman, when the chairman mentioned that you were 90 years old-I have an 82-year-old father who still works 18 hours a day. I go back on weekends to work in his bakery. The thing that we enjoy most is listening to jazz every Sunday. He digs out his old tapes and records, and the two of us just sit there listening to some of the giants of the music world, going back to jazz at the Philhar- monic. I can't begin to express to the people who are here what that does when I see him and the light that comes on in his eyes when we listen to that music together. So I am personally fully aware of the therapeutic value of music. This is not only for older people. There is an experiment going on in Japan. I don't know the name offhand of the physician, but for years now he has been playing music to the fetus in pregnant women, and they have found there are extraordinary results coming from that with early development for multilingual opportu- nities. They develop much more rapidly than those without the benefit of that music having been played during that time. That's something that I want to explore at a later hearing.5 Let me conclude by welcoming all of our witnesses here todayand simply say that I believe that music, indeed, does rescue theheart from despair-particularly those who are confined to institu- tions, to those who may have suffered the loss of a spouse, the lossof their independence, and the loss of their homes. Music can playa very important role in rescuing that heart from despair.Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statements of Senator Cohen, Senator Kohl, andSenator Simpson follow:] OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR WILLIAM S. COHEN Mr. Chairman, thank you for convening this hearing to explore ways that musiccan be used as therapy to improve the health and quality of life of older Americans. Music has long been recognized for its special therapeutic and healing powers.William Shakespeare was reflecting on the value of music as therapy when he ob-served that: \"(Music) * * can minister to minds diseased, Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow, Raise out the written troubles of the brain, And with its sweet, oblivious antidote, Cleanse the full bosom of all perilous stuff Which weighs upon the heart ' ' '\" As the Chairman noted, Dr. Oliver Sacks will be testifying before the Committeelater this morning. In his book, Awakenings, he tells us that the \"power of music tointegrate and cure ' ' * is quite fundamental,\" and that music served as the \"pro-foundest non-chemical medication\" for his patients. This will not come as news to any of our panelists or to the music therapists inour audience. Today, music therapy is a well-established, research-based profession,with over 5,000 certified music therapists practicing nationwide. Music therapistspractice in a variety of settings such as hospitals, rehabilitation centers, nursinghomes and senior centers. Through the carefully structured use of music, musictherapists are able to help elderly and disabled individuals improve not only theirmental and physical functioning, but their quality of life as well. Quality health care encompasses not simply medical treatment, but also a basicunderstanding and respect for the patient as an individual and a human being. Thecreative opportunities provided by music therapists are particularly valuable forresidents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Music therapy canhelp to counteract the feelings of apathy and despair which are routinely experi-enced by long-term care patients coping with the loss of their independence, theirhomes, and often their spouses or friends. Such feelings of despair can defeat theefforts of the most understanding and hard-working health care personnel and canfrustrate the entire purpose of the facility which is to maintain and improve themental and physical well-being of the residents to the greatest possible extent.Mr. Chairman, once again I commend you for convening what promises to be amost interesting hearing, and I look forward to the upcoming testimony. STATEMENT OF SENATOR KOHL Mr. Chairman: I would like to thank you and your staff for bringing together suchan outstanding group of people for today's hearing. I must admit that I knew verylittle about music therapy before Senator Reid announced plans to hold this hear-ing. But over the past month, I have received many letters from music therapistsfrom Wisconsin, each describing how music therapy can make a difference in thelives and therapeutic progress of older Americans. I was especially moved by a letter from Wiltrud Hubbard, a registered music ther-apist at St. Anne's Home for the Elderly in Milwaukee. I wish that I could includein the hearing record a wonderful photograph that Ms. Hubbard sent to me thatshows St. Anne's band at their July 4th concert. Ms. Hubbard explained that theband includes many who have showed marked improvement after joining the group,including a 100 year old woman who loves to play the clavichord and who won'teven allow a visit from her family to interfere with her music sessions. St. Anne'sband also includes a woman with advanced Alzheimer's who has learned to play themaracas. When this woman entered St. Anne's a year and a half ago, she did not6 want to go anywhere or do anything; with the help of music therapy, she now plays the maracas like a professional, with a smile on her face all the while. There is so much that we can learn from our witnesses today about using music therapy as a tool to improve the lives and health of our nation's senior citizens. I am delighted that the Aging Committee is examining such a promising subject today, and I deeply appreciate Senator Reid's leadership in raising Congressional and public awareness about the value and potential of music therapy and the tre- mendous work of our nation's music therapists. STATEMENT OF SENATOR ALAN K. SIMPSON Good morning, Mr. Chairman. Your timing is very good-with all the thrashing around we have been doing on and off the Senate floor these last two weeks, you have provided us a delightful reprieve. I understand that today we will hear testi- mony of a sort not often offered up at these committee hearings-stories with a happy ending, stories that testify to hope and promise rather than high drama- doom and gloom. I, for one, am most appreciative. \"Music therapy\"-not a field many of us are familiar with. I have reviewed the materials you provided earlier (and I appreciate that, too ..') and I am intrigued. As many of my colleagues know, I have an interest in the subject of age-related de- mentias that is of a very personal and intimate nature. My own dear father resides in a nursing home in Cody, Wyoming. I visit him; it is extraordinarily painful to watch this marvelous man whom I love so dearly slip away-physically and mental- ly. That is just an extraordinarily difficult thing. My dear mother is 91 this month and is doing fairly well. My amazing mother-in-law is 91. So my wife Ann and I know something of this subject! So I can appreciate the hope and the excitement of those who believe they have found a new way to reach those people who have what the clinicians call \"demen- tia\". I am a bit of a skeptic by nature-but I would surely wish to know more about this field called \"music therapy.\" I look forward to hearing of your stories-and your successes. Thank you. Senator REID. Senator Grassley. STATEMENT OF SENATOR CHARLES GRASSLEY Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Chairman, I have got more to learn from this hearing probably than anybody else. I used to sing in church on Sunday until people would turn around to see who was singing behind them. I soon got the message that I probably don't sing very well. You know, the true value is probably something that we all have to learn here, and I'm glad to know that music is very instrumen- tal in helping people this way. I am sorry that I was late. I was involved in other business. But my staff tells me that the introduction was a perfect demonstration of the power of music to affect people. The letter you read from Dana Gentry was moving and a very good introduction for this hearing. The topic that we take up today is a very interesting one, even for this Committee which has taken up many interesting topics over the years that I have been a member of it. The size of this crowd demonstrates the interest, as well as the importance, of this hearing, as well, as we have a very good turn-out. I think exploration of this topic will expand all of our horizons. I have said how I think it is going to help me a great deal. I understand that it seems pretty clear that music can be very effective as therapy, or as an aid to therapy, for ill and disabled older people, and can be a help and an inspiration to older people who are well. I was particularly interested to learn from reading in prepara- tion for this hearing that music can be very helpful in getting older7 people to exercise. I suppose that this is obvious when you thinkabout it, but its importance may not be generally realized. I was interested in this because a recent report by the Instituteof Medicine called \"The Second 50 years\" contains a number ofhealth promotion recommendations which, if followed, wouldenable older people to achieve and sustain better health and well-being. Among their recommendations was that exercise continuesto be important at an older age in maintaining good health.Of course, I realize that this is just one of many important thingsthat can be accomplished through music. I think that this hearingwill have done a service, even if the only thing it does is help tospread the idea that music should become a bigger part of the livesof older people in whatever setting they may find themselves.If this Committee can help more concretely by finding ways toencourage settings such as nursing homes and senior centers andcongregate meal sites use some music in some of the ways our wit-nesses will describe today, then I say so much the better. I am looking forward to the testimony of our witnesses today,Mr. Chairman. Senator REID. Thank you, Senator Grassley. We have some votes pending. Senator Cohen has left and is goingto try to get back in time to get me over to vote.Mrs. Goldman, please proceed with your testimony. We'll do ourbest to be as attentive as possible. We greatly appreciate your wait-ing through all these opening statements. STATEMENT OF MRS. IDA GOLDMAN, ROCKVILLE, MD Mrs. GOLDMAN. [Videotape presentation.] Mr. Chairman and members of this Committee, my name is IdaGoldman. I'm 90 years old. I live at the Hebrew Home of GreaterWashington in Rockville, MD. I'm happy to have a chance to talkto you about one of my favorite subjects-music. I like to sing. I like to dance. And all day long I hum my favoritetunes, one song after another. Music makes my day.This past spring, our music therapist, Kathy Mollard, directedour own version of \"South Pacific.\" The music was beautiful, andeveryone seemed to enjoy the show. For the first time, we had sixhigh school students play a part in the show. They were from theChurchill High School in Gaithersburg. I like it when we have twogenerations working together. It makes me happy to know that I am able to entertain otherpeople. I sang \"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outta My Hair.\"The beautiful music in the show was therapy to the people in theshow, as well as for the audience. Music is better than medicine. I know that for a fact. Before Ihad surgery, they told me I would never walk again. I had terriblepain in my leg and back. I couldn't even close my hand. But when Isat and listened to the music, I forgot all about the pain. When Ilisten to the music-any kind of music-I don't think of anythingelse. My whole mind is only on the music I hear. I even dance to the music. My toes just start tapping away everytime I hear music-even in a restaurant. I like all kinds of music,and the waltz music is my favorite.8 Part of the therapy of music is that it brings many memories from past years. I can remember when my mother used to sing Yiddish songs to me. She sang to us all the time. I love to think of the song that my husband sang to me-and you just heard that- \"Let me call you Sweetheart.\" My grandson, Daniel, just won a big award for playing the drum. It is a changing world, but one thing that never changes is music. We have a lot of music in our home. My friend, Joe Arnoff, plays for us on every Saturday afternoon for 2 hours, Monday for 1 hour. He just started playing music for us Friday evening. He plays waltzes, classical music, and many of the singers. He plays big band music to give us a lift. Samuel Rogow plays his harmonica in the lobby every day. He can play almost any song. He's an invalid. He is in a wheelchair. Our music therapist, Kathy Mollard, plays the piano beautifully. She plays for us every Thursday night, and she plays music on every floor in the Hebrew Home-and that's four floors. She works at it all week long. The people in our hand bell choir play beautifully. Some of the people are in very poor health, but they can still make pretty music. Kathy and Anita help us put on a musical every year. I have been in \"Annie Get your Gun,\" \"Oliver,\" \"Oklahoma,\" \"Wizard of Oz,\" and \"South Pacific.\" I'm looking forward to making my next big hit next year. I hope you can all come and see it because I am inviting every one of you. I really don't feel my age. I feel like a youngster. I get younger every day. Senator REID. Thank you, Mrs. Goldman. Would you please proceed, Mrs. Johnson? STATEMENT OF LOIS JOHNSON, McDONALD, KS Mrs. JOHNSON. Mr. Chairman and members of this Committee, I want to thank you for this opportunity to let me tell you about music therapy as I witnessed it with my husband and other pa- tients with dementia of the Alzheimer type. My name is Lois Johnson. I am from McDonald, KS. I'm sure you are wondering where McDonald is. McDonald is a small town in northwest Kansas-150 people. I own and operate the only retail business in town-a small grocery store. I'd like to tell you a little bit about the disease as it happened to us. My husband, Tom, was only 48 years old. He managed a small grain elevator, a job he thoroughly loved, and I managed the small grocery store. Our last three kids left for college, and our first grandchild was on the way. We felt things were just looking very good for us. Tom was always a very great family man. He never missed many events that his children performed in. Many times we would go to one town and watch his sons perform in ballgames, and drive to another college and watch our daughter perform in a dance drill team. Tom was a very proud father. He was also very proud to be a volunteer fireman. He was very skilled with his hands. He remodeled our home several times. He9 made lots of gifts for his children and his friends. He could repairanything from a motor to a car. And he was also quite a prankster.I remember one time he delivered a 2-ton rock, put it on his broth-er's front door step, and then put an ad in the local paper advertis-ing a pet rock for sale. These were his pet jokes.But slowly this nightmare began. We first noticed that he wouldmake any excuse to avoid going to a sporting event, or a familyget-together, or anything that had a lot of people involved. Hebecame more and more withdrawn. His jokes and his puns becamemore of the cruel kind. He would go up to people and tell them\"You're getting very fat,\" or \"You're getting bald headed,\" or \"Yousure are getting grey.\" I can remember he started pinching and pulling hair, and itdidn't seem to matter if he knew the people or not.One day the fire whistle blew, and Tom actually hid to keep fromgoing to the fire. Suddenly one day he came up to me and he announced he hadquit his job. I said, \"How in the world do you intend to pay thebills?\" He just looked at me and he said, \"You can do it.\" Thatseemed to be his answer to everything at that time-you can do it.Tom had always been an affectionate, caring person, but now wenoticed that he was becoming more and more withdrawn. He re-treated to bed every chance he got, as though he could sleep awayall the bad things that were happening to him. One son came homefrom college one vacation, and he said, \"Mom, all I see in Dad'seyes is blankness.\" The kids were noticing a big change in theirfather. Our youngest daughter lived with us at this time. She was wait-ing for her first teaching job to open up. She came to me one dayand she said, \"Mom, I just can't stand this tormenting any longer.I'm going to have to move out before I hate my Dad.\" I well under-stood what she meant, but can you imagine the terrible feelings wewere going through? To me this just seemed like a nightmare that had no end.Two years passed before we got a diagnosis. Several months ofthis time Tom spent in a mental hospital. When we finally got thediagnosis, Tom was no longer the person that we used to have. Hebecame a stranger needing constant care and constant supervision.But we now had some answers to the strange things that had beenhappening. A dementia of this type attacks the short-term memory bankfirst. And the first things to go are their personality and theirsocial graces. I often refer to this as the death of a personality, be-cause that's exactly what is happening. You are losing them instages, and the personality is the very first. Slowly everything else disappears and they return to total infan-cy. When I could no longer take care of Tom I took him to the vet-erans' hospital in Topeka, KS. This was 300 miles from our home. Idid go visit him several days each month, but by this time Tom wasso agitated he could no longer sit or sleep-only for brief periods oftime. I resorted to walking the hallways with him.There was no recognition left that I could see. He could no longerspeak-not even one word. And I could no longer get eye contactwith him.10 I noticed that Tom developed what I called the \"caged animal\" syndrome. He was always full of fear, always seeming to be fleeing from something, but he didn't know what. On three different occa- sions he eloped from the locked-door ward. After Tom had been ill for about 6 years the VA called me and they said that Dr. Clair had selected Tom to be a student in her music therapy for the Alzheimer's patient. My first thought, I have to admit, was very selfish. I said, \"Good. They are going to have to keep him at least 2 more months and I'm not going to have to worry about what to do with him.\" My second thought was, \"What in the world do they hope to accomplish? Here is a man that can't even speak.\" The first few sessions went just as I had thought they would. Tom would not sit still, he would not participate. If they handed him an instrument, he simply laid it on the floor. But I went back several weeks later and a wonderful thing was happening. Dr. Clair was sitting in front of Tom. She had eye contact. She was holding his hands. She was singing to him. And Tom was making sounds in his throat as though he was trying to respond. I just couldn't believe it. I even saw him reach toward a guitar and strum it. He played the maracas in a way that was only him. He would touch her knee, he would touch his head, and then his knee. He did this in repetitious movement for as long as the music played. I could see tears in Tom's eyes whenever the patriotic songs or the hymns were played. The thrill of seeing just a little bit of the man that I used to know was just overwhelming. I knew that Tom could never get well, but music opened up a window to his soul that I just so badly needed at that time. I also observed changes in other dementia patients. One patient that had not spoken a complete sentence for a long time stood up and sang a jazz song from start to finish without missing a beat. My daughter is a registered nurse, and she tells of a patient in her care that is very violent and aggressive, but his daughters can come and sing to him and he calms right down. My mother developed a malignant brain tumor at the same time that Tom was sick. She returned also to her childhood, but we used music as a way to keep her calm, too. During the last several months of Tom's life he became the infant that I told you about. He became totally bedfast, needing constant care. Everything had to be done for him. But there was in his eyes something you can't imagine. Music therapy gave me one last key to reaching that past-term memory that I so badly needed at this time. I could always reach Tom with music. I could take his hands, get eye contact, sing a slow, soothing song, and the fear would simply leave his eyes. One day, in particular, Tom seemed more aware. I can remember that afternoon that I sang the song \"Amazing Grace\" to him sever- al times. I'm not a musician. That just happened to be the only song I could remember the words to. I left the hospital later that evening, and within the hour they called and said that Tom had passed away. Music gave me some moments that I will always remember, and I know that it gave him peace.11 I do not believe that music therapy can cure the dementia, but Ido believe that it can reach a part of the past-term memory thatother things cannot reach. And anything that can stimulate thisbrain can hold off the disease maybe just a little longer and givethem a little bit more peace. I am convinced that music therapy is a very important link tothe past for the Alzheimer's patient and for their families, as itwas for us. After my husband was diagnosed with Pick's disease, a severe de-mentia related to Alzheimer's, I was invited to serve on the Gover-nor's Task Force for Alzheimers and related diseases in the Stateof Kansas. I continued to serve as a spokeswoman from 1985 to1989. During this time, I testified within hearings that resulted in leg-islation that provided some support and help for patients and fami-lies. The \"Helpline\" was installed in the Department of Aging. In-surance for long-term care was improved to include people diag-nosed with Alzheimer's disease. A Division of Assets bill waspassed to help the spouse of a long-term care patient.I continue to give workshops in Kansas and Colorado to nursinghome staff and family members about coping with a long-term de-generative disease. I appreciate your scheduling a hearing about music therapy andgiving me a chance to share my views. Thank you. STATEMENT OF SENATOR CONRAD BURNS Senator BURNS. Thank you, Mrs. Johnson. That's a very touchingstory. Not too far from where you live we are experiencing the samething with my wife's father in North Platte, NE. We are experienc-ing what you and your family have experienced.Here's a man that was born on that ranch, raised all of his kidson that ranch, and in the same house, and now he can't find thebathroom. Mrs. JOHNSON. Right. Senator BURNS. When you were going through those times, didyou have any resource of a support group or another person?Mrs. JOHNSON. I had nothing. Tom was diagnosed at a time thatAlzheimer's was very, very unknown. There was one book written,\"The 36-hour day.\" I started to read it, and it was so clinical and sodepressing I never did finish it. We had never even heard the word.But in our town of 150 people, they actually took care of my hus-band while I worked. Senator BURNS. You are still living in McDonald?Mrs. JOHNSON. I still live in McDonald.Senator BURNS. I may have my mother-in-law call you.Mrs. JOHNSON. I would appreciate that. I work a lot with Alzhei-mer's patients and their families. I have support groups. I do teach-ing in nursing homes. I'd be most happy to talk to her.Senator BURNS. Because it is a terrible thing.Your husband responded to music when he was at the VA hospi-tal. Mrs. JOHNSON. That's right.12 Senator BURNS. Did you note if other patients also responded to music? Mrs. JOHNSON. Very much so. The man that I spoke of that sang the jazz song was in his group. Twice a year they would have a dance for the patients and invite the spouses. You'd be amazed at the people that could hardly walk that could get up and dance. Senator BURNS. We got to taking a resource count in my State. I think we only have six music therapists in the whole State of Mon- tana. Those of you that are not from Montana, it is 148,000 square miles, but we are only 800,000 people. Would you advocate some sort of Federal help in this area? Mrs. JOHNSON. I certainly would. If you can't get enough of the music therapists, themselves, I see no reason they couldn't teach the activity directors, and also teach them in the way that is effec- tive. I have seen music in nursing homes, but it has a beat, it has a lot of background. This doesn't work. You need something more calming, something more direct, and they need to learn this. I think music therapy teachers could teach the activity directors. Senator BURNS. Unknowingly, on the other hand, my parents, who are still living in northwest Missouri-we celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary the other day-both of them are still living in their own home and keeping their own garden, going on like they don't even know they are old. Mrs. JOHNSON. Wonderful. Senator BURNS. Quite a lot like Mrs. Goldman. Two or three years ago, my mother used to play the piano. She couldn't read music very well. She always played by ear. In fact, she learned at a theater where they had silent film. We gave her one of these little electric pianos. She plays it all the time, and it is great therapy. Mrs. JOHNSON. Wonderful therapy. Senator BURNS. And so I take your words as very weighty words here. We appreciate your coming today. Mrs. Goldman, the residents of Hebrew Home where you live can participate in music every day. Would you say that's very impor- tant to their daily routine? Mrs. GOLDMAN. Very important. There are a lot of invalids there. Senator BURNS. Do you think music therapy should be offered to residents in other homes like yours across this Nation? Mrs. GOLDMAN. We have a resident that is an invalid, and he plays music for us every Saturday afternoon for 2 hours, and he plays 1 hour on Monday mornings, and now he started playing for us every Friday night. We have a ball. It is sing along, mostly. And then we have this young lady next to me, Kathy, who plays beauti- ful music for us on Thursday nights. She plays the records, but she does play the piano. We just love it. It seems that everyone became alive. But, as far as myself, I grow younger every day and love it. Another thing I want to say is that the world is changing, but music will never change. Thank you all for coming to hear me. Senator BURNS. It is our pleasure coming to hear you. I have always been a little bit of a philosopher, myself, and I have always said that music and humor cures more than pills or hypodermic needles. I still believe that. So we thank you three young ladies for13 coming to this Committee today. I'll turn it back to my chairman,Senator Reid. [The prepared statement of Senator Burns follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR CONRAD BURNS Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for scheduling this hearing today on Musicand the Aging. Looking at those here that will be testifying and all the folks that have come tolisten, it is obvious to me that music plays a great part in our lives, both for theyoung and the aging. I know that I can easily relieve stress, brighten my day or justremember a happy occasion by listening to the right music. It makes perfect sensethat this should be the case for older Americans, especially those with special needs.I thank all of you for being with us here today. And I commend you for yourenergy-it's contagious and inspiring. I look forward to hearing your testimony andenjoying the performances to come. Senator REID. Senator Burns, thank you very much.Ladies, thank you very much for being here today.We will now have as our next witness Dr. Oliver Sacks from NewYork City. Dr. Sacks, would you come forward please?This is Robin Williams in disguise. Dr. SACKS. Advanced version. STATEMENT OF OLIVER SACKS, M.D., NEW YORK, NY Dr. SACKS. Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I firstwant to express my gratitude for being allowed to testify beforeyou today. I submitted some written testimony, but I think I may wing it.Senator REID. That testimony that has been submitted in writingwill be made part of the record. Please do wing it.Dr. SACKS. A century ago Nietzsche, the philosopher, wrote somefascinating notes on physiology and art. In particular, he spoke ofthe powers of music. He talked of these as being dynamic, tonic,mnemonic, concentrating, communicating, and liberating. Hequoted an aphorism of Novalis, the poet, that all diseases are musi-cal problems and all cures are musical solutions. He also said\"When we listen to music we listen with our muscles.\"I think these insights have been clarified and confirmed and il-lustrated by our experience in these days. I work especially with older patients in chronic hospitals of vari-ous sorts, and neurological disabilities are particularly commonamong such patients-especially Parkinson's disease, strokes, andAlzheimer's disease. Together, these affect more than 10 millionpeople in this country. I should add that I have also worked with populations of autisticand retarded people, and also with psychotic populations who canbe greatly helped by music, but I will confine myself to speaking ofthe older populations with physical and neurological disabilities.I am constantly struck by the fact that, though medicine cannotoffer some of these patients any decisive cure, their neurologicalfunctioning, no less than their morale, can be immensely improvedby therapeutic measures of a nonmedical sort-especially byhuman contact, by art, and, above all, by music therapy.This can be equally true of elderly patients who have had ortho-pedic mishaps. Their rehabilitation is never a purely surgical14 matter. They have to get back that total integration of movement and posture which they had before the injury. Let me give you an example. I saw one patient, an old lady who had had a complex hip frac- ture which required surgery and immobilization with a cast. Her leg hadn't recovered after this. It was apparently paralyzed and useless, although no orthopedic reason was clear for this. I asked her if her leg had ever moved. She thought for a bit, and she said yes, there was a Christmas concert a year back and when an Irish jig was played her foot kept time. So clearly her leg and some part of her was capable of responding to music. Physiologically, we found a complete electrical silence in the muscles of her leg, and we couldn't find any \"evoked potentials\" in the leg areas of the brain. The leg was no longer being represented neurologically; yet, on occasion, it could respond to music. Physiotherapy was of no help for this lady, but music therapy was of enormous help. We were able, after she told us this, to elicit rhythmic, automatic responses to music, first in the foot, then in the whole leg. Later we were able to get her to dance with support, and finally to walk. I wish I could show you a tape of all of this, because it is an ex- ample of a permanent restoration of function which was made pos- sible by music. But my special experiences, as you referred to, are with post-en- cephalitic and Parkinsonian patients. In patients like this, there may be a good deal of muscular stiffness and rigidity. There is great difficulty initiating movement. There can be long periods of freezing and transfixion. There is an absence of spontaneity, and even when movement and speech are possible they tend to be feeble and rather lifeless and mechanical. But such patients show an unimpaired ability to respond, wheth- er it is to a thrown ball or, especially, to music. And one can see patients who, though unable to walk, are able to dance; and pa- tients who, though unable to talk, are able to sing. At this stage, if it works, I'd like to show you a little bit of videotape from the docu- mentary of \"Awakenings.\" [Videotape presentation.] Dr. SACKS. You see how in singing the voice is transformed in this patient. It is usually flat and toneless and anonymous, but when she sings it has a full volume, a full tonality, a full emotional range. In another bit of this tape I don't have enough time to show you, you see this almost immobile patient able to dance, and in doing so to recover all of her animation. I thought there was going to be more tape, but let me just men- tion another patient who is also in the documentary, another post- encephalitic patient, Rosalie, who often, for hours a day, would be totally transfixed, usually with a finger touching her spectacle lens. But as soon as we brought her to the piano-she loved play- ing-she would be transformed when she played. There was an ease and a fluency and a freedom and a normality which one never saw at any other time. Not only did music liberate her from her Parkinsonism, but the imagining of music would do so. She knew all Chopin by heart, and all one had to do was to say \"Opus 49\" and immediately the F15 Minor Fantasy would start playing in her mind and her rigiditywould disappear, her facial expression would come back, and shecould move easily. And if one did an EEG-an electroencephalogram-at this time,the brain activity, which was normally of an almost coma-like slow-ness, would also become normal while she was playing or imagin-ing music. So here, very strikingly, music was a cure-at least, re-stored her to normal cerebral and psychic function while it lasted.This power of music to animate and to organize activity is moststriking in patients with motor and motor-regulatory disorders likethis. Music is not a luxury to such patients, it is a necessity. Theycannot even move without it. One such patient, who had been a former music teacher, spoke ofherself as having been \"unmusicked\" by her Parkinsonism and asneeding to be \"remusicked\" in order to move.Equally important is the power of music to mobilize elderly pa-tients who may have become immobile because of illness or depres-sion or lethargy or pain or fear. Immobility is a great danger insuch patients. It predisposes to everything from bed sores to de-mentia. Music can act as a tonic and get such patients going.With regard to how it works, we can only speculate. The affectedparts of the brain in Parkinsonism are the basal ganglia, whichhave been called the \"organs of succession.\" If these are damaged,people have great difficulty with successions of movement, withconsecutive movement. But music can apparently substitute for this damaged brain func-tion and become a template for organizing movement and fordoing. To some extent, music can act instead of the basal ganglia,can act as a prosthesis for this damaged part of the brain.This is not something mechanical. Patients don't react to anymusic, they have to have music they like, and music which movesthem. This is true, in general, of music therapy. There is no suchthing as \"general\" music. All music is particular, and it mustaccord with the tastes of each patient. As music can substitute for lower functions, it can be vital inhigher functions. In Alzheimer's disease, as you have heard, youcan have patients who are unable to talk, unable to organize them-selves, patients who are agitated and confused. Music for them canhave an almost magical power by eliciting memories and associa-tions and restoring to them the moods, the memories, the fluency,and the feeling of their former selves and their former lives.Music perhaps is mostly dynamic in something like Parkinson-ism, but it has an evocative and mnemonic power in patients withAlzheimer's disease, which can totally recall the lost person for awhile, or rather give access to lost powers and lost identity-anaccess which cannot be provided by anything else. Here again, aswith the brief awakening of post encephalitic patients, this restora-tion to self and to normality is accompanied by a temporary nor-malization in the EEGs. In summary, though the nervous system is sometimes comparedto a computer, I think it is much more like an orchestra or a sym-phony. I think we are musical through and through, from thelowest levels of rhythm in our nerve cells to the highest levels.There is a vast range of neurological disorders in which this inner16 music is impaired, and all of these can be transformed by the heal- ing power of music. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Dr. Sacks follows:] TESTIMONY OF DR. OLIVER SACKS, NEUROLOGIST Neurological disabilities are particularly common in older age groups; this is espe- cially so of strokes, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, which together affect more than ten million Americans over the age of 65, and often necessitate their admission to nursing homes and chronic hospitals. As a neurologist who has worked with such patients for 25 years, I am constantly struck by the fact that though Medicine cannot offer them any decisive cure, their physical and mental states, their functioning, can often be immensely improved by remedial and thera- peutic measures of a nonmedical sort, for example by art therapy and most especial- ly by music therapy. This may be equally true of elderly patients who have suffered broken hips and other orthopedic mishaps: the rehabilitation of such patients is not a purely surgical matter-they need to regain their former motor competence and confidence, that total automatic integration of movement and posture which they enjoyed before their injuries, and here too music can play a vital role. Let me give you an example. One patient, typical of many, was an old lady with an apparently paralyzed and useless left leg. It had been like this since a complex hip fracture, followed by surgery, and weeks in a cast. Surgery had been successful, but her leg, strangely, remained inert and useless. The muscles of the leg, indeed, showed a complete \"electrical silence,\" and \"evoked potential\" studies in the brain showed that it was no longer represented in the sensory areas, had completely dropped out of body-image-and yet it was a good leg, with no residual injury. Had the leg ever moved since the injury, I asked her? Yes, it had-it once \"kept time\" at a Christmas concert, when an Irish jig was being played. This showed that the leg could respond, could move, if there were the right, musical stimulus. Ordinary phys- iotherapy had been useless-could musical therapy accomplish what physiotherapy had failed to, we wondered? In fact, it did: we were able to elicit strong automatic (\"entrained\") responses to music and rhythm, to get her to make dancing move- ments, and finally to walk. I wish I could show you a tape of all this-the power of music in such a patient to effect a permanent restoration; but time is limited, and I must pass on to other examples. My most concentrated experience, over the years-as some of you will know from the film or book of \"Awakenings\"-has been with post-encephalitic and parkinson- ian patients. In these patients there may be much muscular stiffness and rigidity; there may be a peculiar difficulty in initiating any movement; there may be long \"hang-ups\" and \"freezings\" and \"trances,\" in which patients get helplessly trans- fixed. There is an absence of spontaneity; and movement and speech, even when possible, tend to be feeble, and lacking in energy and life. And yet such patients shows an unimpaired ability to respond-and may do so, dramatically, in response to sudden emergencies, or a suddenly-thrown ball, or in response to appropriate music. The power of music is very remarkable in such patients-one sees parkinson- ian patients unable to walk, but able to dance perfectly well; or patients almost unable to talk, who are able to sing perfectly well. I cannot bring a patient to show you, but I have brought a little videotape, excerpted from the documentary of \"Awakenings.\" (Show Tape Excerpt) A motionless patient rises when music is played, and though still rigid, dances to it fluently. * ' * The patient's low, flat, almost unintelligible voice is transformed when she sings \"Just a song at twilight.\" It regains all its old volume and fluency; there is a complete return of all its emotional and vocal tone. Here is another patient, Rosalie, who for hours a day tended to remain transfixed, completely motionless, stuck, usually with one finger on her spectacles. But she can play the piano beautifully, and for hours-and when she plays her parkinsonism disappears, and all is ease and fluency and freedom and normality. Music liberates her from her parkinsonism for a time-and not only music, but the imagining of music. Rosalie knows all Chopin by heart, and one has only to say \"Opus 49!\" to her for her whole body and posture and expression to change. Her parkinsonism vanish- es, as the F-minor Fantasie plays itself in her mind; her electroencephalogram (EEG), usually of almost coma-like slowness, also changes, becomes completely normal-when she is playing (or even imagining) music. The power of music to ani- mate and organize brain activity-Kant called it \"the quickening art\"-is particu-17 larly spectacular in patients like this who lack the normal ongoing motor andmotor-regulatory activity the rest of us have. Music is not a luxury but a necessityto such patients, and can (for a while) provide them what their brains no longerprovide. The affected parts of the brain, in parkinsonism, are the basal ganglia, whichhave been called \"the organs of succession.\" If they are damaged, patients havegreat difficulty with sequences, with consecutive movement-but music can substi-tute for this basal gangliar function, can become (while it lasts) a \"template\" fororganizing a series of movements, for doing. This is not something mechanical-themusic must \"move\" the patient emotionally, otherwise it will have no basal gang-liar effect. So it is not sufficient, usually, to put on a loud rock band, or Muzak-there must be a sensitive exploration, first, of the kind of music which works foreach patient. There is no \"general\" music-music is particular and it works, in thefirst place, by evoking a particular response, a particular appreciative and creativeresponse, which can then translate itself into a specific physiological activation.This may be so even in other animals: thus studies by Otto Creutzfeldt at the Max-Planck-Institut in Gottingen, with multiple electrodes measuring brain activity,have shown that cats may be calmed or activated by music, and that music canbring about striking synchronizations and \"entrainments\" of brain function. Themusic which does this most powerfully is Mozart-all cats respond to Mozart (he isneurologically \"correct\"), though different cats respond best to different pieces byMozart. Each cat, each brain, has its preference, its favorite-the one that worksbest for it. As music can substitute for \"lower\" motor functions, organized in the spinal cordor basal ganglia, it can equally serve to stimulate and organize higher mental func-tions, especially when these have been damaged by disease. Many elderly patientswith strokes are aphasic-they have lost some of their ability to articulate or usewords; but the words which are lost may come back with singing, and music therapycan sometimes help the patient to adopt a sing-song way of speaking, a way whichwill hold sentence-structure in a matrix of music. Other patients may have a visualagnosia-an inability to organize, to make sense of the world visually. But such pa-tients, like Dr. P., in my book, \"The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat\", may beable to substitute music for seeing, to reorganize their activities and perceptions inmusical terms, to hold themselves and their lives and their worlds together withmusic. Finally, and most importantly: those patients-whose numbers now, tragically,run into the millions-those patients with a dementia due to the diffuse corticaldamage of Alzheimer's disease, patients who may be in a pitiful state of agitationand confusion because their memories and powers to organize are failing, becausethey cannot hold themselves and their worlds together. The power of music is fun-damental, with such patients, but it works in a different identity-restoring way. Forthe parkinsonian, music acts as a template for organizing movement, for doing; forthe dement, it acts as (a sort of) Proustian mnemonic, eliciting emotions and associa-tions which had been long forgotten, giving the patient access once again to moodsand memories and thoughts and worlds which, seemingly, they had completely lost.One sees that it is not an actual loss of memories here, but a loss of access tothese-and music, above all, can provide access once again, can constitute a key foropening the door to the past, a door not only to specific moods and memories, but tothe entire thought-structure and personality of the past.Thus with music-and here, above all, it must be the \"right\" music, the musicwhich holds significance, has meaning for the individual-the demented patient canbe restored to himself; can recall, re-access, not only his powers of speech, his per-ceptual and thinking skills, but his entire emotional and intellectual configuration,his life history, his identity-for a while. It is incredibly poignant to see such re-calls, such restorations of the otherwise lost persona. I wish I could show you someof the extraordinary tapes which Connie Tomaino, our music therapist, has made ofsome patients; I wish indeed that she could be here today, for she could convey,much better than I could, the full wonder of these things.In summary, though the nervous system is sometimes compared to a computer, itis really much more like a symphony or orchestra, in which everything must be syn-chronized, harmonized, melodized. There is, in health, an \"implicit\" music, whichkeeps the basal ganglia, the cortex, all parts of the brain, together-an implicitmusic rooted, first and foremost, in the rhythmicity of all nervous action and itstying-together, its entrainment, at more and more complex rhythmic levels. If, be-cause of damage or disease, the nervous system is impaired in its sensory input ormotor output, or its internal integrations in the basal ganglia or cerebral cortex,then this internal natural music is interfered with, and the need for an external18 music is overwhelming. There is a vast range of neurological (and neuropsychologi- cal) disorders-ranging from simple motor problems to parkinsonism to language and perceptual deficits, to dementia (to say nothing of such problems as autism, re- tardation, and depression)-in which the innter music of the organism (which Harvey, in 1627, called \"the silent music of the body\") is impaired; and all of these can be transformed, if only for a while, by the healing powers of music. Senator REID. Dr. Sacks, I think that we need to pause and con- template on what is going on here today. We have you, who just isn't someone who came in from the street with some ideas. You are a medically trained neurologist. As a result of the work which you did, which you wrote about and now which has been depicted in a movie, it has triggered people's imaginations so that people like Theodore Bikel and Mickey Hart, who are musicians and have known all their musical lives that this magic happens, you are now here trying to explain to us that it really does happen for some medical reasons. You should be congratulated for that. Doctor Sacks, I watched the movie \"Awakenings\" the other night-and, by the way, I had read the book beforehand. If patients are immobile, inactive, and their muscles atrophy as was the case for those depicted in the movie, how could they get up and start walking and doing these things? Dr. SACKS. In Parkinsonism there may be a lot of rigidity, and rigidity, itself, can prevent atrophy and act like a sort of isometric exercise. Senator REID. Is that right? Dr. SACKS. But also these patients had been walked passively, so they weren't totally immobile. Senator REID. Dr. Sacks, how accurate was the movie? Dr. SACKS. It had some romantic additions, but otherwise it was reasonably accurate. Senator REID. I guess the point that I wanted to make is that you were a young physician going into this facility, and these patients were-and I, as all politicians, have been into some nursing homes. The facility depicted there is like many in Nevada that I have been in. You walked in there. Why did you throw the ball and have people reaching for it? What caused you to think that these people could be awakened? Dr. SACKS. Well, there had been accounts and anecdotes of pa- tients suffering with- Senator REID. And you had studied this and remembered it; is that right? Dr. SACKS. Well, the nurses would tell me about anecdotes. The nurses were wonderful. Some of them had been with the patients for 30 years, and so had therapists. And I sometimes saw this sudden action for myself. Senator REID. For those in the audience that haven't seen the movie and don't know what we are talking about, people who had been asleep, in effect, sitting and staring off into space, when thrown a ball would reach up and grab the ball. Right? Dr. SACKS. Yes. I think probably it was closer to a sort of trance- like state or a transfixion, a spellbound state, rather than sleep. Senator REID. Anyway, why did you think that the work that you did would awaken these people, some of which was with music? Dr. SACKS. Well, one saw in this transfixed state that there needed to be a drawing of attention out of their own sphere. Some-19 times you would see a patient staring at the ground, and if yousimply said to him, \"Look over there,\" he could break out and lookover there and maybe walk over there, but he couldn't do so alone.You had to call him. So my first act before any medication became possible was tolook at the different things which could call these patients out oftheir spellbound state. A very strong one was music.Senator REID. Tell me, doctor, these people, during the time thatthey were awakened, did they have thought processes?Dr. SACKS. Yes, indeed. Senator REID. The movie depicted that these people were normalduring the time that they were awake. They communicated. Isthat, in fact, the case? Dr. SACKS. Yes. It is very much the case. One had very much thefeeling of the normal personality and normal intellectual powersand thought processes which had been imprisoned or transfixedand needed to be let out. Senator REID. Now, Doctor, with the medication that you weregiving these people-L-DOPA I think was the name of it-the posi-tive effects of it diminished over time. With music is there thatsame diminishing effect? Dr. SACKS. No. However deep the disability, I think the powers ofmusic are always there and are permanent. And when the medi-cine wears off, music is still there. It employs a different physiolog-ical mechanism. In a way, it bypasses the Parkinsonism.Senator REID. Senator Cohen.Senator COHEN. Thank you very much.Doctor Sacks, you indicated in your testimony that all music isparticular. It is not universal in appreciation, as such. I think Mr.Hart is going to testify that percussion perhaps is universal. Thepeople in the audience cannot see this, but hopefully if there isever a replay of this hearing they will notice that while you weretestifying your right foot was tapping, and you were perhaps noteven aware of that. But, as you were responding to questions fromSenator Reid, in particular, I noticed that you were tapping withyour foot. So perhaps Mr. Hart can talk to us about the universali-ty of percussion as far as music is concerned.Of course, you were quoting Nietzsche. It goes back a lot furtherthan Nietzsche. Plato talked about the music of the spheres andthat the musicians were the ones closest in this whole hierarchy ofdevelopment of the human being to the philosopher king. Next tothe philosopher king were the musicians. I think there has been arecognition historically of the importance of music in our lives.I was wondering-I have been doing some reading in a differentfield of the mind-body connection-some of the writings of DeepakChopra, who was an Indian endocrinologist who talks about thepowers of the mind to actually engage in the healing process, aswell. There is more and more literature being disseminated on avery wide-scale basis, and I suspect this falls into the same catego-ry of the interconnectability of the mind in the healing process.I was wondering about something. Would some patients or peoplebe more responsive to visual stimulus or stimuli as opposed tomusic? Art, for example, versus music? Is there anything in your20 experience that would indicate that a visual experience is perhaps better for a particular patient? Dr. SACKS. Well, certainly if patients are profoundly deaf then visual stimuli are all important, but I think other forms of art therapy are also crucial. People with Alzheimer's disease some- times who are no longer able to speak or conceptualize can do beautiful art and can enjoy art. I think visual art is equally impor- tant for them. Senator COHEN. Is it necessary to have any prior musical back- ground for a patient to be responsive to it? Do they have to have either studied music in the past, had their parents force them to play the piano as they were growing up, as many of us were? Is there anything that goes back to prior experience? Can you have someone who has no experience other than perhaps listening to music as a teenager? Is anything required in the way of prior expe- rience? Dr. SACKS. I don't think any musical skill is required. I think mu- sical responsiveness is universal, even in people who are sometimes called unmusical. Certainly responsiveness to rhythm is universal. Actually, that's not only in human beings, but also in many ani- mals as well. There have been some fascinating physiological stud- ies about the effects of music in cats. I should add that Mozart is most effective with cats. Senator COHEN. Bach doesn't do as well? Dr. SACKS. Apparently not. Senator COHEN. With respect to therapy or therapists, is it their job and their experience to single out the kind of music that would be most applicable to that given individual? In other words, Bach might be okay, or Mozart, but maybe not Kenny G or maybe not the Grateful Dead. Dr. SACKS. I think music therapy always has to occur in a human relationship. This will include exploring what the patient likes most and responds to most, and then perhaps expanding that. Senator COHEN. Is there anything in your experience that leads you to the conclusion that music would make it possible for a per- manent curative effect rather than a temporary response? Dr. SACKS. Well, I think that Parkinsonian patients and patients with movement disorders can learn to imagine music and organize their own activity with it internally to a considerable extent. And I think sometimes with Alzheimer patients, once the doors have been opened they may remain open to a considerable extent. I think the last witness indicated that. So I think one definitely has some after effect. Senator COHEN. The chairman and I were wondering how it came that you were able to make yourself look like Robin Wil- liams. Dr. SACKS. People say now that I'm imitating all his gestures, but it was the other way around. Senator COHEN. That's all I have, Mr. Chairman. The record will show that during my questioning Dr. Sacks tried very hard to keep his foot still but was not successful. Senator REID. Senator Pressler.21 STATEMENT OF SENATOR LARRY PRESSLER Senator PRESSLER. Thank you very much. It's a fascinating hear-ing, and I am here to listen and learn. I must say that when I first heard of this hearing I was a littlebit of a skeptic, but I want to congratulate the staffs and the Sena-tors who thought of it and pulled it together, because it has openedup some new ideas to me. I, too, saw \"Awakenings.\" I did not read the book, but there wasone thing I was fascinated with. I know that the prescription ofdrugs by psychiatrists is a controversial matter, but, as I under-stood from the movie-and if this is a real life situation in thebook-a certain drug was prescribed, or certain treatment, and thepeople started to get better, to respond more, and then, after awhile, the side effects of the drug brought on some negative charac-teristics. Is that correct? Dr. SACKS. Yes. I think to some extent this happens with alldrugs, but it was particularly clear and tragic with these patients,probably because there had been so much brain damage. Perhaps99 percent of the nerve cells which could respond had beenknocked out, and a person couldn't maintain normality on the 1percent remaining. The film actually was somewhat more grimthan the reality. In fact, many patients were able to get throughsome of the side effects and some of them are still alive. One ofthem, in fact, came along to the set and did a scene.Certainly, although drugs are not the answer-in Parkinsonismor anything-they were crucial for these patients.Senator PRESSLER. Well, leading to the Government's role inthings such as that-and I had a family member who died of Alz-heimer's. I've been fascinated for a long time. There is always abelief by some Alzheimer's patients and their relatives that theycan get some drug in Mexico that they can't get here. Our Govern-ment, I guess, is fairly reluctant to allow drugs to be used bypeople until their efficacy and their complete results have beenchecked out. Have we been too cautious on letting drugs be tried on peoplewith Alzheimer's, which is hopeless anyway? Dr. SACKS. That's a delicate question, but I think probably so. Webecame extremely cautious in this country after the thalidomidetragedy in England and Europe when tens of thousands of peoplewere born with birth defects after mothers had taken the sleepingdrug, thalidomide. I think we are a little over cautious, and certainly with drugs forParkinsonism and Tourette's syndrome there are many which arevery well established and confirmed in Europe but are not avail-able here. Typically people smuggle these in. I think the situation is less clear with Alzheimer's disease, al-though there are a number of drugs which are promising for symp-toms, and perhaps some others which, at a deeper level, may havesome promise of slowing down the disease process, itself.Senator PRESSLER. Yes. Now, switching back to the subject of this hearing, music andaging, what are you saying to us as Senators? Should we try to ap-22 propriate money to have more music? Should we give NIH money to do research on this? What do you want us to do? Dr. SACKS. Twenty years ago, when New York State looked into the business of having a music therapist at Beth Abraham Hospi- tal, which is the hospital of \"Awakenings,\" they said, \"But this is entertainment. It's trivial. What does it do?\" I showed them the effects of music in our Parkinsonian popula- tion and with our Alzheimer's population. I showed them how much the quality of life could be improved and how much all sorts of medical complications could be avoided, and then they changed their minds and they provided funds. In a practical sense, I think that music therapy and music thera- pists are crucial and indispensable in institutions for elderly people and among neurologically disabled patients. I think that what is pragmatic and intuitive needs to be investi- gated. One needs to know what goes on. There is really no research on the subject. There needs to be research, and there needs to be funding for such research. I think also there needs to be some proper awareness and respect for music and music therapy so that it is not seen as something just trivial or entertaining. Senator PRESSLER. Yes; That's an excellent statement. Now, turning to the NIH-the National Institutes of Health- what does the NIH do that is close to this in terms of research? Dr. SACKS. I am aware of funding by the National Institute on Aging for research being conducted by Dr. Suzanne Hanser at Stanford University and also by Dr. Kenneth Swartz at the Univer- sity of Rochester. Dr. Hanser's research is on music therapy with depressed elderly and Alzheimer's patients and their families. Dr. Swartz' research is on musically evoked potentials in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. Senator PRESSLER. Are there any private research foundations that are doing research along those lines? Dr. SACKS. Yes. There are certainly some private research foun- dations. For example, the effects of music with autistic children is a subject of considerable research privately funded. Here special groups like the Parents of Autistic Children are often important in donating funds. Senator PRESSLER. Thank you very much. I may have some more questions for the record if the record is going to be kept open. Senator REID. It sure will be. We all have lots of questions for you, Doctor Sacks. We could spend the day with you. Regrettably, we cannot do that. Thank you very much for allowing us to use some of your time here today. Dr. SACKS. Thank you. Senator REID. The next panel of witnesses today consists of Mr. Mickey Hart of Sonoma County, CA; and Mr. Theodore Bikel of Wilton, CT. Would Mr. Bikel and Mr. Hart please come forward? We will first hear from Mickey Hart.23 STATEMENT OF MICKEY HART, SONOMA COUNTY, CA Mr. HART. Good morning. Thank you for inviting me to speak toyou on this issue of great importance to me-the issue of howdrumming, the rhythmic manipulation of sound, can be used forhealth and healing. I also would like to express my support for the concept of pre-ventative rather than crisis medicine, and specifically the role ofmusic therapy as a means of maintaining mental, spiritual, andphysical health in people of all ages.I am a professional percussionist. For over 40 years I have livedand I have played with rhythm as an entertainer, as an author,and always as a student. Over the last 10 years I have spent muchof my time exploring rhythm and its effect on the human body.Why is it so powerful and attractive? I have written on this subject in my books, \"Drumming on theEdge of Magic\" and \"Planet Drum,\" which try to address thesequestions. And yet I know that I have barely scratched the surface,particularly regarding the healing properties of rhythm and music.Everything that exists in time has a rhythm and a pattern. Ourbodies are multidimensional rhythm machines, with everythingpulsing in synchrony, from the digesting activity of our intestinesto the firing of neurons in the brain.Within the body, the main beat is laid down by the cardiovascu-lar system, the heart and the lungs. The heart beats between 60and 80 times per minute, and the lungs fill and empty at about aquarter of that speed, all of which occurs at an unconscious level.As we age, however, these rhythms can fall out of sync, and thensuddenly there is no more important or crucial issue than regain-ing that lost rhythm. What is true for our own bodies is true almost everywhere welook. We are embedded within a rhythmic universe. Everywherewe see rhythm, patterns moving through time. It is there in thecycles of the seasons; in the migration of the birds and the animals;and the fruiting and withering of plants; and in the birth, matura-tion, and death of ourselves. By acknowledging this fact and acting on it, our potential forpreventing illness and maintaining mental, physical, and spiritualwellbeing is far greater. As a species, we love to play with rhythm. We deal with it everysecond of our lives, right to the end. When the rhythm stops, so dowe. And this is where music becomes important.According to the late ethnomusicologist, John Blacking, music isa mirror that reflects a culture's deepest social and biologicalrhythms. It is an externalization of the pulses that remain hiddenbeneath the business of daily life. Blacking believed that a largepart of music's power and pleasure comes from its ability to recon-nect us with the deeper rhythms that we are not conscious of, andit is the connection with these rhythms that gives music the powerto heal. Music, as humanly organized sound or vibration, has played apivotal role in the development of our species, beginning with toolmaking. The tool record, all those delicately chipped arrowheadsand choppers, is a dramatic illustration of our battle to master the24 subtle body rhythms that any advanced civilization requires to sur- vive. In order to create the tools that allowed us to move forward as a species, we learned to scrape, strike, rub, shake, and swing in rhythm. From there we gathered in groups to sing our songs, to tell our stories, to dance our dances-all in rhythm. We found that by gathering together in this way it reinforced our sense of community and family. The natural extension was the use of rhythm, and specifically percussion instruments, in healing ceremonies by traditional and medical practitioners. As modern technology takes us further and further from our nat- ural rhythms, the use of percussion for healing has greater poten- tial than ever. Today, without thoroughly understanding it, thou- sands of people across the country have turned to drumming as a form of practice like prayer, meditation, or the martial arts. It is a practice that is widely acknowledged to help focus atten- tion and to help people break through of the boredom and stress of daily life. More importantly, drumming is a way of approaching and playing with the deeper mysteries of rhythm. Typically, people gather to drum in drum circles with others from the surrounding community. The drum circle offers equality because there is no head or tail. It includes people of all ages. The main objective is to share rhythm and to get in tune with each other and themselves, to form a group consciousness, to entrain and resonate. By entrainment, I mean that a new voice, a collective voice, emerges from the group as they drum together. The drummers each bring their own instruments and drum to- gether for about half an hour. Afterwards there is a discussion of issues of importance to the group. The drumming helps to facilitate this discussion because as they drum the group forms a common bond. From groups of women drummers, the 12-step groups like alco- holic anonymous, to gatherings of men who are part of the ever- growing men's movement, drumming is used to open up channels of communication and foster community and family. While some drum groups form around a particular issue, others have no agenda whatsoever except to allow the members an oppor- tunity to come together, play their instruments, and share rhythm. Older Americans are largely unfamiliar with this movement, and yet these are the people who could benefit the most. The formation of drum circles among the elderly should be an integral part of any music therapy program. There is a large and enthusiastic group of drummers who could be called upon to lead workshops and make instructional videos to be distributed among the older population now isolated in nursing homes and retirement communities. It would be emphasized that the object is not public performance because when we speak of this type of drumming we are speaking of a deeper realm in which there is no better or no worse, no modern or primitive, no distinctions at all, but rather an almost or- ganic compulsion to translate the emotional fact of being alive into sound, into rhythm, into something you can dance to. Through drum circles, the aging population could tap into this realm, into these rhythms. The benefits would be wide ranging.25 First, there would be immediate reduction in feelings of loneli-ness and alienation through interaction with each other andheightened contact with the outside world. While today many older people spend hours each day sitting infront of the television, drumming is an activity which would allowthem direct exposure to younger people from the outside communi-ty. Whereas verbal communication can often be difficult among thegenerations and in the sickly, in the drum circle nonverbal commu-nication is the means of relating. Natural byproducts of this are increased self-esteem and the re-sulting sense of empowerment, creativity, and enhanced ability tofocus the mind, not to mention just plain fun.This leads to a reduction in stress, while involving the body in anon-jarring, safe form of exercise that invigorates, energizes, andcenters. There is no question of the substantial benefits which could bederived from increased funding for the study and research of musictherapy. This funding is critical to explore the most effective waysto utilize the techniques described here by the other speakers. Bil-lions of dollars are spent each year for crisis care, while littleenergy is spent trying to figure out how to avoid the crisis to beginwith. A shift from crisis medicine to preventive medicine needs tooccur. The introduction of drum circles and percussion instruments intothe older American population is a new medicine for a new cul-ture. It was a good idea 10,000 years ago, and it is a good ideatoday. Thank you. Senator REID. Mr. Hart, if you remain seated while Mr. Bikelgives his testimony, we have questions for both of you.Mr. Bikel. STATEMENT OF THEODORE BIKEL, WILTON, CT Mr. BIKEL. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, if you assume that Dr. Sacks was Robin Williamsin disguise, I hope that you are not going to assume that the wordsthat are about to emanate from my mouth will really be spoken byMilli-Vanilli. And I'm going to watch my feet, too, while I speak.Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, my name is Theo-dore Bikel. I am a musician, a singer, and actor. I also serve asPresident of the Associated Actors and Artists of America, the um-brella organization under whose roof you will find all the unionsand guilds representing performers in all disciplines, from theatreto opera, to TV, to films and variety. What expertise I may have personally I derive from a life-longcareer as a stage actor and as a concert performer and musician. Iam also no stranger to the interaction between the arts and gov-ernment, having served for 5 years as a member of the NationalCouncil on the Arts at a time when that body enjoyed a better rep-utation than it does today-or at least a better image in the pub-lic's mind. I thank you for having invited me to take part in the inquiry.26 Mr. Chairman, as a rule, Congressional inquiries are prompted by pragmatic motives, leading directly to the enactment of some measure or another. While this may very well be the case here, too, I am nonetheless heartened by the impression that in the first instance the Committee seeks information-thought leading to more thought. If, at some time, a utilitarian purpose will emerge and some pro- grams are put into place, so much the better. But we, too, are in need of this interchange of thoughts, for we come looking not for money, but for knowledge. For far too long have we looked upon the needs of the elderly with a painfully narrow focus. This is a mistake, by the way, we also make when contemplating the needs of the very young. As a basic premise, I hope we can agree that to view the needs of the aging in terms of physical survival alone makes very little sense. We are slowly beginning to discard the notion that the care of the very young and the very old are to be viewed primarily in terms of the utilitarian aspects of the process, for there is a demon- strated need to build and nurture the mind through aesthetic awareness. Human beings are in need of music-indeed, of all the arts, as Dr. Oliver Sacks said-not as frills and luxuries, but as a basic ne- cessity. In the last analysis, mere physical survival is meaningless without its cultural corollary. The question is constantly posed: survival to what purpose? To eat? To sleep? To wake and eat again? Or to see, to touch, to smell, to hear the sounds of music, of laughter, and of grief. To learn and to continue to learn until the last minute. In other words, enrich- ment-or, if you prefer, fulfillment. Mr. Chairman, I cannot attest to the healing power of music the way doctors, scientists, or therapists can. I can only claim what years of experience have demonstrated to me many times over- music not only lifts the spirit, but heals the soul. I have even seen it give a physical lift to persons whose very ability to move was close to zero-as has been described here before-and that led to surprisingly successful attempts at foot tapping, and even dancing. I have, on numerous occasions, performed in senior citizens re- tirement homes. Many in those audiences were confined to wheel- chairs. Some were even brought in on a gurney. The ambulatory residents, too, were not much better off. Their faces showed resig- nation, apathy, and lethargy. Health care personnel offered apolo- gies to me in advance, fearing what to a performer might seem like an insulting lack of reception. More often than not, these fears turned out to be unfounded and not only was the lethargy gone while the music played, but the effects lingered on for quite a while afterwards. I submit that this has less to do with how I play and sing, but rather with the kind of music I make. This is a country of immi- grants. Many older Americans have roots and antecedents in Europe and elsewhere. Contrary to popular belief, we are not a melting pot, nor should we be. We are a kaleidoscope. In a melting pot everything flows together to form an ill-defined, no-shape, no- color, indistinct mass. In a kaleidoscope everything is clearly delin- eated, and all contribute to the beauty of the whole.27 Many senior citizens may lose strength and vitality, but they dohold on to the memories of their youth. Anything that evokes thesememories will put them into a brighter and happier frame of mind.Mr. Chairman, I am multilingual. I sing in 21 languages, 5 ofwhich I speak with fluency. I have been able to play Greek songs toGreeks, French songs to Frenchmen, Spanish songs to Hispanics,and Russian songs to all manner of Eastern Europeans. Most of allI sing and play what my own family tradition has bequeathed tome by way of Jewish music. Thus I have often observed old andinfirm persons as the sounds of their ethnic heritage brought themout of a near-catatonic state. They managed to laugh, to sing along,and even to clap to the sounds of their youth.It seems to me, Mr. Chairman, that, rather than seeking to elimi-nate multiethnic diversity in this Nation, we should look to its sal-utary effects and use it constructively in the treatment of olderAmericans. I have so far spoken of the effect of music on older people wholive in retirement or nursing homes. Despite the fact that theseolder folk are constantly surrounded by other residents, by healthpersonnel, by social workers, and other staff, their existence is basi-cally a lonely one. My own mother, who has been in a home for the past 9 years,feels-rightly or wrongly-that she has little in common with thepeople around her and keeps mostly to herself. Beyond the day-to-day pleasantries, conversation is apt to lead to disagreements,which in older people rankle more deeply than they would with us.I assume that we are younger. It doesn t always hold true.However, get these people to sit together and listen to music anda bond develops. The shared experience may not last beyond therecital, but while it is there it is real. That brings up the questionof what is to be done for older Americans who are not, for what-ever reason, confined to nursing homes, who live alone, or withfamily. Even living with the family cannot ward off the feeling of loneli-ness and isolation. Family members have their own agendas, andquality time with grandma or grandpa is a rare occurrence. Sharedmusical events with a family are even more rare.Now, could grandpa get as much from the music in the solitudeof his room? Do tapes and records furnished to the elderly have thesame beneficial effect as a live musical experience? I doubt it.If it is true that pets are a source of great comfort and healingfor the old, then surely toy dogs won't be just as good. No. It is im-portant: one, for the experience to be live; and, two, to have venueswhere seniors can share the experience. Day care centers for theaged can play a very useful role here. The same van services whichpick up seniors for their regular hospital visits might well be usedto carry them to recitals or other musical events; but the eventshave to be planned with a great deal of care.Now, this brings up the question of who is to coordinate and leadthese activities. I am not referring here to people trained in musictherapy. As a rule, in nursing homes, retirement villages, and daycare centers, these activities are often dumped in the lap of an al-ready overburdened staff person, a nurse, or a social worker. Todirect and supervise these activities they go through some rudi-28 mentary crash courses in the arts. I submit that we are missing a bet here. There is a vast pool of underemployed artists in this country, in- cluding musicians, dancers, singers. Some of them may, themselves, be close to retirement age. Would it not be far more beneficial to use these people to plan music, to play it, to encourage older people to participate? Not to replace medical personnel or social workers, but to free them for the duties they are properly trained for- which, in any case, keep them fully occupied. To be sure, not every artist is a born group leader. People have to be trained to do that, as well. But I submit it is far more diffi- cult to teach a nurse some musical knowledge than it is to teach a musician how to reach out to other people or to teach. A training program for artists to work with the elderly would surely benefit the Nation. In conclusion, I would ask you to contemplate the following: Some of our basic assumptions about the aged can be reduced to three equations-old age equals poverty, old age equals loneliness, old ages equals infirmity and sickness. Of course, many old people are neither sick nor poor nor lonely, but for those who are there are ways to alleviate the hardship. Above all, there is music. With some talent, some skill, and a lot of love, we may be able to employ music to enrich the poor, give company to the lonely, and heal the sick. Thank you. Senator REID. Mr. Bikel, I'm fascinated with your statement. Being from Nevada, I have observed a significant change in recent years with the playing of tapes and synthesizers and other technol- ogies that eliminate the need for live music in the minds of some people. The new President of the National Musicians' Union is a man from Las Vegas. He has made the point many times that there should be more things for these people to do who have dedi- cated their lives to music. I think you have pointed us in the right direction. Someone asked what the purpose of this hearing is. I think the purpose of this hearing is to alert Congress and the American public that music is an inexpensive way to alleviate pain, loneli- ness, and suffering, and, in effect, to heal people in some instances. So there is going to have to be more work done to focus attention on the fact that music can do a lot of things that people didn't think it could do. In the words of Dr. Sacks, it is not trivial or only for entertainment purposes. If we can come out of this hearing with nothing more than that, I think we have made a significant contribution to people's good health. Mr. Hart, how many drums do you have? Mr. HART. Many. Hundreds. Senator REID. You are a collector of percussion instruments? Mr. HART. I am. Senator REID. And in reading your book, which I just got last night-I haven't read it, but I will do that before the next week passes-you indicate that there are some musical instruments that you have had stored and haven't had a chance to play with them. Mr. HART. Not many, but a few.29 Senator REID. Tell us specifically how you feel drumming ormusic can be used as preventive health care to keep medicine ex-penditures down. Mr. HART. Well, drumming really is the artful manipulation ofrhythm and noise. That empowers you. When you hear a loudsound, it allows you to center around it, it describes the sacredspace where you are going to play, and it enhances your concentra-tion. It releases adrenalin. It does a lot of things. It allows for com-munity. This is the most important thing. It allows you to sharerhythm with someone on an equal basis. I think that's the biggestpower of music. Senator REID. Obviously you and the Grateful Dead have hadsome indication of what pleases people because you have beengoing longer than anyone imagined you could. This year you arethe leading tour group in the world. Mr. HART. That's what they say. Senator REID. Part of that success was your two concerts in LasVegas, which were two of your biggest. Mr. HART. Yes. This is what we would call group rapture. This iswhere a lot of people come together to share an experience, andthat's what music is all about, really-to share that experience.Senator REID. And I think we have all experienced the anticipa-tion of going to someone you really wanted to listen to, and whenyou get there it is exciting. That's what we are talking about hereon a smaller scale, are we not? Mr. HART. Yes, that's true. Senator REID. I'd like you both to comment on this. Rhythmic en-trainment is a well-established principle in the physical sciences.You put two clocks or a number of clocks in this room, and soonthey will tick together. That's a scientifically proven fact.Can you gentlemen describe in your own words this phenomenonand tell us how this could relate to human health? Mr. HART. Entrainment isn't just a mechanical law. It also has todo with the heart. You can entrain to a city. You can entrain whenyou walk down the street with your wife. You can entrain withher. You walk in time with her. You beat in time with someone.That's what entrainment really is. It is the rhythmic resonancethat you have with somebody or something around you, and that'swhat music does, and that's the main ingredient in group music.When you play music privately, that's another story. You entrainwith the drum or the instrument you are with. It is a focusingtechnique. The drum happens to be one of the most elegant tools that manhas ever devised for the making of rhythm, and that's why I be-lieve so strongly in rhythm. Mr. BIKEL. I have been in many societal situations, Senator,where the togetherness aspect of the music was almost as impor-tant, and sometimes more important, than the music, itself. Themusic was not necessarily well sung or well played, because it isnot always played by professionals or by people who devote theirlife to music, but that togetherness aspect created something thatwas far greater than the music that was being made. I recall in the 1960's when I was arrested in the South for civilrights activity and put in jail for a period that the music kept us 48-782 0 -92 -230 alive together, and while we were put in segregated jails-the whites in one portion of the jail and the blacks in another-we sang across the courtyard with each other and we were one. It meant more than the music. Senator REID. You talk a lot about ethnic music having a power- ful affect on people from that ethnic group. If we refer back to Dr. Sacks' written testimony there are a couple of lines here that say, \"So it is not sufficient usually to put on a loud rock band or Muzak. There must be a sensitive exploration, first of the kind of music that works for each patient. There is no general music. Music is particular and it works in the first place by evoking a par- ticular response.\" That's why, when you go to-at least I'm asking if you will agree with me-that's why when you go to a retirement home and, for example, there are people there who are Jewish, and you sing something in Yiddish, that could bring back a memory of that per- son's childhood; is that right? Mr. BIKEL. It is absolutely correct, and it really enlivens not only the moment, but brings back a whole slew of associated things that the people had buried somewhere. It brings them out of their shell. Senator REID. I hope you had the opportunity to listen to the ex- cerpt I read from Dana Gentry, who used to work for me. It is a wonderful story, and I only read part of her letter. This woman's grandmother was in a trance-using the words of Dr. Sacks. She was oblivious to everybody around. She and her mother would go feed this elderly woman because she couldn't feed herself. One day Dana just started singing \"True Love,\" from the musical \"High So- ciety.\" It was something that the grandmother had sang with her grandchild. As soon as she started singing this song, for the first time the grandmother came awake. Now music is what they use for therapy with this woman. Even though it is for brief periods, the grandmother is herself for a very short period of time. We appreciate very much your adding your expertise as musi- cians to the medical testimony rendered by Dr. Sacks. Mr. BIKEL. I gave a copy of a letter to Dr. Sacks just before this session started which arrived in my home only three days ago. A woman wrote to me after I had given a concert in Saint Louis. It was from a little town in Missouri. She had brought her autistic son, who was 30 years old and deaf because of his autism-deaf to all intents and purposes. He reacts for some reason or another to my music. They have tapes of my stuff playing in the car. They brought him to the concert. She said, as a footnote, he's not even Jewish. And at the end of my concert he stood up and made the love sign in sign language, and on the way home in the car the son turned to his mother and he said, \"I hear a bird singing.\" And that person is deaf. Senator REID. Senator Cohen. Senator COHEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hart, is this the first time you have ever testified before a Congressional committee? Mr. HART. No. I testified in support of the rain forest about 2 years ago.31 Senator COHEN. I was going to say I thought it would be entirelyappropriate that your first appearance be in the Hart Building. I guess I can't say that now. Mr. HART. Feels like home. Senator COHEN. And I was curious, when you stated-by the way, I must say I feel some affinity. One of my sons, who has fol- lowed you across the country at least once and back- Mr. HART. God save you. Senator COHEN. And I never quite understood what the term \"dead head\" meant until I listened to the music. Mr. HART. Excuse me, Senator? Could you clarify that? Senator COHEN. I meant that in a positive way. He is a big fan, and I have tapes of yours that we both listen to quite frequently. You mentioned in your book in one of the passages that a village without music is a dead place. That's an African proverb. Is it your assessment that the same applies for the soul? A person without the music is a dead place, as such? Does that apply? Mr. HART. Well, we have had music in every culture since pre- history. We have seen it on the walls of the caves in 15,000 B.C. We have seen it in the rather godless cultures of 8,000 and 10,000 years ago. We have seen it in every culture worldwide. There must be areason for this. We couldn't be making this story up. We find that all cultures have music of some kind-some vocal music, some percussion music. It is inherent to the nature of man. This is just that simple. We love to dance to our music. We make music to celebrate. We make music to communicate, to be born by, to die by. All rites of passage usually are accompanied by some musical accompaniment. So I would say without music it would be a dead place. Yes. Senator COHEN. I noticed you said before that when the music stops we die. I remember that song by Don McLean, \"The Day the Music Died.\" It was a very powerful song. Mr. HART. I might add something, Senator, that I overlooked before. There are two ways to listen to music. We're not talking about entertainment here. There is a spiritual way. There is arealm of the spirit, which goes to the soul, and then there is the entertainment message. Music is far-reaching. Music therapy isjust the latest development in the understanding of vibration.That's really what it is all about-rhythm and vibration. Senator COHEN. Mr. Bikel, if I were a rich man I would still want very much to hear your music. In fact, it plays over in my mind so many times at various moments-and not when we're talking about Congressional pay raises, I can assure you. But let me ask you: What do you think the role of the arts com-munity should be in this particular category? You mentioned thatperhaps it doesn't hold up to what it used to be in today's times. What is the role of the arts community -and Mr. Hart, as well? Should we be trying to train artists to go into nursing homes, torest homes, to deal with the elderly? Is there a training programthat the arts community ought to be supporting and sponsoring? I know that you have volunteered much of your time in doing this. Do you think that an organized, institutional approach has some merit?32 Mr. BIKEL. I advocate it, especially in light of the fact that the profession is so over-crowded. There are too many people chasing too few jobs, and there are many unemployed musicians, unem- ployed singers, and unemployed dancers who wait on tables, or per- haps just wait for the next job to come along. But they have years of training in music and their talents can be put to good use by training them how to do these things, to work with older people, with sick people, and to have them do good music in the places where the good music is needed. Senator COHEN. So you think, then, the National Endowment for the Arts ought to be directing some of its energies in this field? Mr. BIKEL. I think it ought to think along those lines. Yes. Senator COHEN. Mr. Hart, how about you? In terms of training other individuals to start engaging in music therapy, as such-as you indicated, it is not simply entertainment, it's curative. I was particularly interested in your notions of wellness. You didn't phrase it as wellness, but that's inherent in what you were saying about the importance of music in creating a sense of self esteem, which is vitally important to maintaining a physical wellbeing, as well. Mr. HART. Yes. Like Mr. Bikel said, there are a lot of unem- ployed musicians around, and they could be used. This could be a task force kind of a thing. They could go into retirement homes and hospitals, they could lead group drumming circles, they can in- struct, they could participate. There is an army out there. They just need the word to march. It's just one of those things. There are a lot of musicians. As a matter of fact, I believe 1 percent of the population we would consider drummers. In this world we figured out that there is about 1 percent of the population that are drum- mers. Mr. BIKEL. We have Meals on Wheels, why not have Music on Wheels coming to the homes? Senator COHEN. Thank you very much. Mr. Hart, just one curious thing. In your book you referred-one of the chapters I think is Hole in the Sky, and you refer to a Joseph Campell. Mr. HART. That's correct. Senator COHEN. Was he the model for the book \"The Peaceful Warrior\"? Mr. HART. The model for what? Senator COHEN. \"The Peaceful Warrior.\" You refer to him as a warrior. Mr. HART. No. Not really. Joe is a good friend, and he was a war- rior in his own right. Anybody can be a warrior. He just happened to discover the power of the drum in his search for the origin mists of our species. We find that most of the origin stories have percus- sion in them. Joe was an intrepid warrior. He went after it. We shared these interests. There were only a few people that I could talk to about stalactites in 20,000 B.C. He was one of them. So he was a warrior, but no. Senator COHEN. Thank you very much. Senator REID. We have a vote pending, so we are going to have to terminate the hearing at this time. We appreciate very much the33 testimony of Mr. Hart and Mr. Bikel. You have added significantlyto this hearing. What I'd like to do-and this is very unusual, Senator Cohen-while we are gone, which will be about 7 or 8 minutes, is call onKen Medema to come and entertain the audience while I am nothere and while Senator Cohen is not here. This may be one way toemploy musicians, because we are gone a lot.We shall return. The Committee stands in recess for about 10minutes. [Recess.] Senator REID. Ken, thank you very much.The next panel we will have today is older Americans whoremain active performers. First we will have Mr. Jerry Lorance ofMuncie, Indiana; and Dr. William Chase of San Clemente, Califor-nia. Again, we very much appreciate your patience.Please proceed, Mr. Lorance. STATEMENT OF JERRY LORANCE, MUNCIE, IN Mr. LORANCE. Mr. Chairman, I want to admit one thing here. Inever heard of a music therapist in my life. I live so far back in thewoods that maybe they haven't reached us. I imagine they havethem in Indianapolis, but to my knowledge Muncie has never had amusic therapist. I think it is wonderful that there are people likethis that are working at this. It is really wonderful.Music has always meant so much to me. I have played music,one instrument or another, since I was 5 years old-not well, but Iplayed it. I had a stroke, and I was paralyzed on the right side. My speechwas gone. The first thing, and about the only thing, that came inmy mind right then was that I'll never play or sing again.They took me home from the hospital, and I had a small key-board in the family room. Believe me, that's where I lived. Everychance I got, I went to that keyboard. I had to move that arm. Ihad to get my fingers to work again.I finally moved my arm, and I played with my fist doubled up-anything, just to make music. It was everything to me.I progressed. I could play less than a minute at a time when Istarted. I finally got up to 45 minutes, and I told my wife, \"Hey,I'm going back to work, because 45 minutes is all a musician plays.He can rest 15 minutes.\" And I did. I have a band-combo. I wentover to the place they were playing, and they wanted me to singwith them that night, one song anyway. You know, I did, but Ishouldn't have. I never lost out on a beat of the music, but thewords-I didn't think those words would come out of my mouth. Iwas thinking right, but the words were altogether different. It waseasier to sing the words, though, than to talk them. The rhythm ofit really helped me. It's the only job I ever had in my life that I canbe worn out, tired, and go to work, and relax and feel good by thetime I get through. It relaxes me.It is terrific, I think, when you can be a part of music. I play fornursing homes in Alzheimer's wards. What a difference musicmakes in their lives. You go in and there is no expression. They34 are sitting there. You start to play, and there is a little light that comes in their eyes. They get up. They dance with each other. They dance around the floor by themselves. It's terrific to see them. They may not know their name, or where they are from, or who comes to see them, but they know the words to \"I Want a Girl,\" and \"When you wore a Tulip,\" and they'll sing it loud and clear. The attendants work hard with these people to give them a little joy in their life. I play for hospitals, for the Stroke Club. I look around and see people that there, but for the grace of God, go I. They are para- lyzed. But when you play you can see a little finger moving, or a toe that taps to a rhythm. Music gets through to them. My wife has been right with me every step of the way. Without her help and understanding I couldn't have made it. But music was so strong in me. I had to come back and play music. I thought my wife was very strict with me. There was no sympa- thy that I could find in her. But I found out later that sympathy doesn't work when you are trying to move after a stroke. It is very rewarding for me to play nursing homes and hospitals. You become friends with these people, and they look forward to your coming back and playing for them. Many of them never have a visitor. I make up song sheets, and they really enjoy singing back in the music of their life. They can remember songs. We'll have a game where I play songs and have them guess them and guess the years they came out, and it is amazing how they know the songs and close to when they came out. It has been a very rewarding experience for me, and I never knew that people were music therapists. I'm so glad that they are here. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Mr. Lorance follows:] TESTIMONY OF JERRY LORANCE FROM MUNCIE, IN Music has always meant so much to me-I have played one instrument or an- other since I was 5 years old. When I had a stroke I was paralyzed on my right side and my speech was gone. I thought that I'd never play or sing again. When they sent me home from the hospital, my keyboard in the family room was my focal point. I had to conquer it-the arm had to move-the fingers had to bend. I had to sing the songs again. It was a very difficult process. I couldn't work at it over a few minutes at a time. Each day I progressed a little further. My arm moved a little more, my fingers bent a little easier, and I could finally put three or four words together instead of the singular words I was able to say. It was easier to sing the words that to talk them. I finally progressed so that I could play for forty five minutes at one time. That's as long as you have to play at one time before you take a fifteen minute break. I was anxious to get back with my Combo and play again. It was difficult the first few times and the singing didn't always come out the way I thought it would. I didn't lose the beat but some of the words weren't exactly as I had intended, but I was back playing and singing again. It was great! It's the only job I've ever had where I can go to work tired or worn out and I can relax while I'm playing and feel rested by the time I'm through. I enjoy listening to recorded music but my first love is being able to play and perform live music. Music is terrific when you can be a part of it. I play for nursing homes and Alz- heimer's wards. What a difference music makes in their lives. Most people have very little expression on their faces when I walk in, but when I start playing there's a light in their eyes! Some don't know who they are or where they are but they know the words to \"I Want A Girl\" or \"When You Wore A Tulip\" and sing it loud35 and cheerful. Music awakes something in them, some get up and dance with eachother or by themselves. The attendants work hard with these people to give them alittle joy in living. I play for the hospital and also for the Stroke Club. I look around and see thosethat are less fortunate than I and I think there, but for the grace of God, goes I. Istart playing and I see a finger that moves with the music or a toe taps out rhythm.Music gets through! I was a casket salesman for twenty five years. When I retired I found I had tohave an additional income. I turned to music and crafts. It was quite a change ofprofessions I had never cut a piece of wood or painted anything in my life. It was aninteresting challenge. My wife had been right with me every step of the way. Without her help and un-derstanding I couldn't have made it. After the stroke she spent hour upon hour get-ting me to talk and to get over my paralysis. I thought she was very strict with meat the time but I knew it was for my own good. Sympathy doesn't work when youare trying to recoup from a stroke.It is very rewarding for me to play for nursing homes. You become friends withthe people there and they look forward to the day when you come and play for themagain. I make up song sheets and they really enjoy singing the music of their life. Senator REID. Thank you, Mr. Lorance. Doctor Chase. STATEMENT OF WILLIAM CHASE, M.D., SAN CLEMENTE, CA Dr. CHASE. Well, I'm William Anthony Chase. I've been a doctorfor the last 54 years. I am 78 years young. I have never really heard much about music therapy, but I havebeen aware of the fact that it is probably the oldest treatment mo-dality on this planet. It begins with the mother giving aid and com-fort to her newborn baby. Only women have the capability ofmaking those wonderful clucking, crooning, kind of sounds whichget down into the baby and cause the baby to give up screamingand crying and to go to sleep. Men don't have that capability, butwomen do. Anyway, frankly, I never heard of music therapy, as this gentle-man said just a short while ago, until this whole thing came upbefore my attention. However, I am a volunteer. I am in activepractice of medicine, still, and I also am a volunteer for the Bever-ly Manor Convalescent Hospital, and also at the Adult Day HealthCare Center in San Clemente, CA. There I have had the privilegeand the pleasure to have seen with my own eyes exactly whatmusic can do with people who are otherwise almost completelyunable to handle themselves physically, emotionally, or mentally.It is a great pleasure for me to go there, because I know what isgoing to happen. When I first began, the people would be very list-less, lethargic, and very, very withdrawn to the point where theywould hardly notice me tuning up my violin. But then, as I wouldplay, they would begin to stamp their feet and to clap their handsand even to sing. The people who were very antisocial among eachother, who would never notice the person sitting alongside of themor behind them or in front of them, all of the sudden would inter-act with their neighbors, which is a very important thing in a con-valescent hospital where patients are crowded together.There is a lot of hostility that can develop if one patient's wheel-chair crosses another patient's and maybe snags her foot or some-thing like that. I have noticed that the interpersonal relationshipbetween patients improves very greatly.36 I have also noticed the fact that television and radio does not seem to provide the same sort of reaction in these people that live music invariably does. The life which is contained in music which is produced right then and there seems to penetrate into their lives and stimulates them to all kinds of beautiful activity. I was playing at the Beverly Manor one day, and we were play- ing a lively song, and all of the sudden a woman who had been wheelchair-bound for years began to stamp her feet and move her fingers and wave her hands, and then suddenly she began to ease up out of the wheelchair and, believe it or not, she arose to her feet and began to tap her feet and dance the shuffle dance in time to the music. The head nurse of the hospital saw that and she rushed up because she was afraid that the patient was going to fall. She grabbed her and she danced along with the patient until the music ended. Now every time I go there this same person greets me with a smile, where before there was nothing-no recognition whatso- ever. And she invariably gets up and dances with somebody from the nursing staff. I have asked the nurses how long this feeling of euphoria lasts after a session of playing like this, and she says generally for at least the rest of the afternoon. And then gradually they creep back into their former selves. It would be very nice if this sort of thing could be provided on a daily basis. I feel strongly that, with the help of government, there should be some way whereby music therapy can be provided on an almost daily basis to these places where they need it so badly. I feel very strongly that music therapy is something that is going to pick up momentum and which is going to be a very, very impor- tant part of our treatment program-much better than medicine. [The prepared statement of Dr. Chase follows:] TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM A. CHASE, M.D. The musical pharmacopoeia provides for stimulation and for relaxation. As human beings we are introduced almost from the first moments of life to the sooth- ing effects of the musical sounds which seem to be the natural communication be- tween mother and infant. Mothers combine the pleasant sounds of their voices with rocking motions which intensify the feeling of well being in the child allowing it to drift off to sleep. I consider this response to sound and to motion to be the precursor to our appreciation of music which is almost always accompanied by words and by movements. As we enter childhood we learn to sing and to move in rhythm to music in our classrooms. Music then stimulates a type of social interaction between boys and girls in which the difference between the sexes becomes noticeable, especially to the children themselves so that the groundwork for entry into adolescence is prepared. Adolescence is a stormy period in our lives; we are suddenly confronted by feelings and thoughts which are new and very exciting. Our world is now populated with gorgeous creatures of the opposite sex and music becomes an acceptable excuse to get close to someone and to engage in romantic movements called dancing. Dancing combines with the singing of love songs eventually and eventually leads to marriage and to reenactment of the cycle of life. Music is a universal force; there is no place on this earth, no matter how primi- tive, where some sort of musical expression is not used. Each tribe or nationality has developed celebrations which are characterized by uniquely stirring music which stimulates dancing and singing and also, unfortunately, fighting. The Austra- lian aboriginees have their weird sound corroborees accompanied by a form of danc- ing which is completely foreign to every other society. Indian tribal dances are ac- companied by the sounds of tom-toms together with very vigorous chanting. The Scots have their \"Highland Flings\" which are extremely vigorous dances stimulated by their particular type of music. The Irish have their jigs, the Poles their polkas,37 the Russians cossack music, and Hawaiians have combinations of extremely sooth-ing music and dancing of the hulas together with the very vigorous dances pertain-ing to warfare. We in this country have had a large variety of dances which are mobile responsesto the stimuli provided by waltzes, fox trots, polkas, swing, jitterbug, and rock androll music. Music obviously has been the motivating force for happy interaction be-tween people of all age groups from infancy to senility.I have noticed in my interactions with older people, many of whom were disabledto some degree, that music was a unifying force around which they rallied in songand bodily movements. Older people returned to the days of their youth and inmany instances remember words and music which they sang and danced to in theiryouth. It so happens that my period of youth corresponds with those of senior citi-zens so that I remember many of the old time songs which were popular in thosedays. I cannot imagine older people to appreciate many of the current popularsongs, but I can picture these young people when they become seniors to be stimu-lated by the music of today. Music has an effect upon all of our emotions. It can make us respond happily, butit can also impart a feeling of melancholy. One of the most beautiful songs everwritten in my opinion is \"Galway Bay\"; but it has a melancholy tone to it which isstirring to the soul and evokes all kinds of emotions in older people. Music is also aforce in the unification of people so that political goals can be reached. The \"Mar-seillaise\" with its combination of soul stirring words and music brought about thecollapse of the aristocratic rule in France. The \"Battle Hymn of the Republic\" con-tributed to the end of slavery in our country.Music is very important in the Armed Forces; I remember very clearly in WorldWar II where as a Battalion surgeon in the 128th Infantry Regiment of the 32ndDivision, I had participated in a 150 mile march over a period of five days with fullcombat pack. This was our final training maneuver before we were again throwninto combat against the Japanese in New Guinea. The purpose of this march was toacquaint the new troops with the hardships of battle. The new troops were broughtin to fill our ranks which had been very much depleted during our battle againstthe Japanese at Buna in New Guinea between September of 1942 and February of1943. This march was extremely grueling. We were given very little time for rest. Ra-tions were skimpy; there was no time for the taking of showers or for shaving. Per-sonal hygiene was minimally achieved. We were a sorry looking lot when we ap-proached the end of our journey at the entrance of Camp Cable just north of Bris-bane, Australia. We were bedraggled; we stumbled along. Many of us were indanger of collapse and then suddenly we heard the spirited playing of \"The Camp-bells Are Coming\", our regimental marching music. The regimental band wasspared the rigors of our march and had met us at the camp boundary. Our bedrag-gled ranks immediately, without any urging from officers, formed up into properorder. Each platoon in each company formed up in our proper marching positionand we marched into camp with every man's head up, shoulders back, shoulderssquared, every man in perfect step. What was more important, all of us derived thefelling from this experience that no matter what befell us in our encounters withthe enemy we would be able to muster the energy needed to cope with our prob-lems. General Montgomery, the British Commander in North Africa, summed upthe situation very succinctly when asked whether or not he needed more troop rein-forcements. He responded by saying, \"just send me a couple of bagpipers\".My direct participation in the production of music began when I was approxi-mately eight years old. My immigrant parents were extremely ambitious for all oftheir children, and especially me since I was the only boy in the family and I wasurged to take violin lessons which were provided me by a Czechoslovian teacher bythe name of Ottokar Vyszehrad. My teacher was a very fine violinist but unfortu-nately he did not become aware of the fact that I really did not know how to readmusic. He never really taught me anything about keys or positions or anything ofthat sort. He would place a sheet of music on the stand and then play it, and Iwould play it right back at him. He undoubtedly thought that I could read music.After several years he told my parents that I needed to have a more accomplishedteacher because I was apparently too good for him and so he sent me to a teacherby the name of Adam Kurillo in the Metropolitan Opera House fairly close by towhere we were living on the lower east side of New York.I presented myself to Mr. Kurillo's studio and he placed a bit of music on a standand said, \"play it\", and I looked at the notes and I could not really read what thenotes said and I let him know that he became enraged and smacked me over myback with his bow and yelled out, \"zaba\", which in Polish means 'toad'. I picked up38 my violin, packed it away, and left the studio and never went back. I never took any more lessons after that. However, I kept on playing for people who visited my home and I also played at Christmas eve and at family gatherings and people seemed to like it. If I heard a song I could generally play it fairly well, and it still persists to this day; I have not taken up a serious study of music, but I am able to pick up the melodies of most pieces if they are not too complicated. I am, then, by no means a virtuoso, but people seem to like my music and that's what counts; at least it counts when I play for older people who have no way of escaping from my violin playing. Actually they seem to like it to the point where they keep on asking for me to play more and more all of the time. It is a thrill to me that I am able to communicate some sort of pleasure to old people who would otherwise have nothing very pleasant to look forward to from time to time. I made it a tradition to play Christmas Carols around the neighborhood every year, except when the weather is too bad, and people look forward to Christmas eve and come over to my house. We start out from there and make the rounds of our entire neighborhood with people coming out greeting us and singing along with us and joining up with us as we go. It is a tradition now where I live in California and it was also a tradition in New York when we lived there. During the time of World War II I was able to buy a very inexpensive fiddle in Brisbane, Australia, and take it with me to New Guinea where I was known as 'the crazy American doctor who played the fiddle on the front lines'. I make music with my violin to the patients at the Beverly Manor Convalescence Hospital in Capistrano Beach, California, and also to the Adult Day-Care Center. The patients in these facilities seem to accept me very enthusiastically so that it has become a custom for me to play at both facilities weekly. People await me with much anticipation and they greet me with obvious enthusi- asm and joy and during my performances they clap, they wave their hands, they stamp their feet, they sing, and in general express much happiness and awareness of the presence of stimulating music. I prefer to play the happy songs from the 20s, 30s, and early 40s and I, of course, do not play any rock and roll type of music because this is completely foreign to them. The kinds of songs that were popular during the post World War I era are extremely tuneful and stimulating and I have no doubt that the people who appreci- ated that music in the early days retained memories of it and also the playing of that music reawakened memories within themselves of their happiest days of their youth. Particularly I must say that my accompanist is a very charming lady who is somewhat afflicted with the loss of recent memory and she is able to, after I have played several bars of music, jump right in with her piano and accompany me to the very end and on all of these, even the complicated songs, and perform extremely well. Her memory is such that she does not remember how she gets to the place where she is performing and her husband must keep track of their dates and must bring her there personally. All it takes is my playing several notes and she is right there with me and we go right to the very end and people just appreciate it and love it and love her and I certainly think extremely highly of her capabilities. I know that these songs are down deep in her soul and they are an integral part of her existence. No matter what takes place in her life she will always have it with her; she will always be able to do it unless she suffers some debilitating stroke-like condi- tion. This same situation applies to all of the people in these age groups who respond so enthusiastically and with much movement and song expressing great joy. As far as I am concerned, these songs even though I hear them very seldom I am able to remember and to give a fairly creditable performance upon my violin. These songs are deeply ingrained within my heart and soul. Music has had a very great influence upon me throughout my entire life. I have always responded appro- priately to the mood of the music as I heard it. I am sometimes moved to tears, and sometimes my soul just soars way out into space there with the beauty and move- ment and thrill of music. Music also has given me courage to face possible dangers as I stated previously, that the 150 mile forced march was a real test of endurance despite the fact that I had a herniated disk; I was working against the herniated disk which practically crippled me. I kept on and walked every step of the way and was proud of having been able to do so, especially when the end came and we were met by that band playing \"The Campbells Are Coming\". Several years ago I developed Dupuytren's contractures which is a condition where the fingers of the hand are placed into extreme flexion by reason of fibrosis39 involving the tendons and tendon sheaths. Had I not been involved with the playingof the violin I would have probably avoided surgery, but since I was doing so andsince my left hand is the hand which determines my fingering on the violin it wasabsolutely necessary to face surgery which I did twice. Now my fingers, even thoughthere are many scars on my hands, my fingers are able to move fairly nimble acrossby finger board. I feel sometimes disappointed in my life because it was obvious to all who heardme when I was a small child that I had a great capability for playing the violin. Butas circumstances dictated and as I described, my teacher had not taught me how toread music; also my traumatic experience with the teacher at the MetropolitanOpera House all blended together to take me out of the didactic study of music andgive me a chance to become a doctor.It is a source of wonder to me how I was able to, in the end years of my life, tobring music and medicine together so perfectly by being involved with bringing joyand happiness and good feeling to older people both ways. I very often take my med-ical bag with me and take care of older people right after I finish playing. I thinkthat God has been extremely good to me and I am thankful that things have turnedout the way that they have. I am also thankful to have made the acquaintance ofmy piano playing partner who exemplifies to me the healing power of music uponthe body and soul. I feel strongly that the good Lord has brought us together andhas made happier and better people out of us.40 Adult Day Health Care Center of South Onge Call Frontem San Oemente Caliomia 92672 1991 A. 2414 Calle Monte Carla San Clemente, CA 92672 Re: Special Committee on Aging Senate Hearing Forever Young: Music and Aging Dear Dr. Chase: I appreciate your asking me to send a letter about the elderly participants of the Adult Day Health Care Center of South Orange County and their reactions to the special music experiences you share with us each week. As you know, adult Day Health Care Center is a day health care program for older adults who come here on weekdays in order to socialize with their peers, share meals, and actively participate in group events while at the same time having access to the services of health care professionals such as physical therapists, music therapist, occupational therapist, speech pathologists, an audiologist, counseling and nursing staff. - A weekly average of 50 participants come to the center between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Most of the participants have impaired physical and mental functioning due to conditions such as Lupas, Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimers, Addisons Disease, dementia, manic depression, schizophrenia, cancer, emphysema, heart disease and stroke. The staff and participants all look forward to your special music on Monday Mornings from 10 to 11 a.m. Your lively person- ality and violin renditions of old favorites really livens up our mornings and gets the week off to a good start. Mrs. E, your piano accompanist, plays beautifully in spite of some limitations in her short term memory. The participants all sing, smile, tap their feet, clap hands and sometimes even dance while you share your musical talents with us. Many of these people respond only in a limited way to other activities. The music which Mrs. E plays is played from her memory of the music which she studied so long ago. She told me that her formal training was at the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music at the age of 18. n'diawd To Celng'41 Page 2--William A. Chase, M.D. Mrs. G., who has had a gastrostomy, usually sits hunchedover because of the pain of her osteoporosis. During music,she brightens up and seems to become a different person. Sheno longer complains and talks of bad dreaas,,Cbut rather smiles,sits up, and interacts with other people. I really enjoyhearing her sing \"In The Garden\" in the microphone while youand Mrs. E. play. Mrs. C., who often sits limp in an almost catatonic state,sings, taps her feet and claps her hands when she hears music.That active participation continues during our music exerciseclass later in the morning. We have stroke patients who have very limited verbalskills (\"yea, yea, yea\" and \"no, no, no\") who sing songs,initiate some conversation, and seem to really enjoy yourmusic. After your Monday morning music sessions, the lively,celebrative mood you facilitate with music lasts through theexercise group and mealtime. The smiles, participation, andactive, vital interest displayed by everyone are indicativeof the value of your taking time each week to share your musictalents. As a physician and musician, you are no doubt aware Ofthe effects of music on a person's physical and mental well-being. Lois Johnson, a 78 year old volunteer who comes everyTuesday morning to play the piano for a \"piano bar\" for ourparticipants, suffers greatly from arthritis in her back andhands. She tells me that playing the piano helps loosen up herswollen joints and actually helps the arthritic pain decrease. I am pleased to hear that you have been invited to speakat the Senate Special Committee on Aging Hearing on August 1.It is certainly an historic moment to have the Senate recog-nize the significant and unique benefits of music therapy forthe elderly as well as for other populations. Your thoughtsand expertise as a physician and a musician will no doubt bevaluable testimony. Sincerely yours, Jo nn Bishop, RMT Activity Director JB42 Adult tDay Health Care Center of South Orange San Clemente, California 1991 Dr. Wi ll iam Chase 2412 Calle Monte Carlo San Clemente, CA 92672 Re: Forever Young: Music and Aging Senate Special Committee on Aging August 1, 1991 Dear Dr. Chase: May we extend our congratulations to you for the national recognition you have received for your music therapy by way of the Senate invitation to address the special hearing on Music and Aging. Over the years, our staff has observed and documented the therapeutic benefits of music in our program. Many of the participants who are not able to speak or remember can spontaneously sing and participate in an activity that is mentally stimulating, emotionally stirring and spiritually comforting. We see the difference music can make in the participants' well-being and certainly lend our support to the profession of music therapy and its place in the health care setting.

Dr. Chase, I'm wondering if you could relate toSenator Cohen and me the woman that accompanies you. Wouldyou tell us about her? Dr. CHASE. Yes. She is 70 years old, and she has short-termmemory loss. I don't want to put a name on that, but I think youall know what I mean. Senator COHEN. That's 70 years young.Dr. CHASE. Well, she's 70 years young. But when she plays thepiano, there is no hesitation about what she is going to do there. Inever tell her what I'm going to play. I just start playing, andwithin two bars she has the melody, which she dredges up fromway down deep in her soul, and she plays the thing faultlessly withme. The people just love it.Senator REID. You play the violin and she plays the piano?Dr. CHASE. I play the violin and she plays the piano. That's right.Senator REID. How did you discover she could do this?Dr. CHASE. Frankly, I don't know. One day I happened to bethere making rounds at the Beverly Manor Convalescent Hospitaland I heard her play. I said, \"Gee, she sounds like a very good pos-sible accompanist for me.\" We got together and, surely enough, wehit it off immediately. Senator REID. Can you converse with her when she is not playingthe piano? Dr. CHASE. Yes, except that her memory loss is very, very sad.We were invited to play at the Presbyterian Church there, and Iaccepted the invitation. Her husband was unable to take her there,so I picked her up and drove her there. We played, and at the endof the program she approached my wife and said, \"I don't knowhow I got here. How am I going to get home?\" I drove her downthere, and she had no memory of my having done so.So Alzheimer's is a very sad thing; however, she was able todredge up all these beautiful songs from way back. We never dis-cuss what we are going to play. I'll just start something and shecomes right along with it-especially the more cheerful songs. Thelively songs are important to her, and also to the people who listen.Senator REID. I appreciate that.Mr. Lorance, what musical instrument do you play?Mr. LORANCE. I play keyboard now. I played saxophone and clari-net for about 30 years. Senator REID. And you said that after you had your stroke andwhen you were in the recovery process, when you were paralyzedon the right side, you had an urge to play music?Mr. LORANCE. Oh, yes.Senator REID. And when you first started playing did you try thekeyboard? Is that what you worked on?Mr. LORANCE. Yes. Senator REID. And you said you couldn't play with your fingers;is that right? Mr. LORANCE. Yes. They wouldn't bend. I couldn't open my hand.I finally got my arm to move so I could put my hand up on thekeyboard, and I know it doesn't sound too good, but it's better thannothing. I just rolled the hand on the keys, and you can makemusic. You can make music anywhere.46 Senator REID. And you feel without any question that the ther- apy that you conducted on yourself has led to your recovery? Mr. LORANCE. Yes. Senator REID. No doubt about that? Mr. LORANCE. No. Senator REID. Senator Cohen? Senator COHEN. Dr. Chase, based on your experience with the residents at the center, would you see these musical sessions as ac- tivity that enhances the quality of life of the residents, or medical therapy, or both? Dr. CHASE. I have no question. Absolutely. Yes, both. Senator COHEN. So it would be both enhancement of quality of life and medical therapy? Dr. CHASE. Yes. Senator COHEN. Is it as effective, from what you have observed, as speech therapy? Do you have the same kind of results when you have a speech therapist go in, or is it more effective? Dr. CHASE. Well, I feel that at the moment of subjecting the pa- tient to music therapy the results are very impressive and they are immediately discernable. I don't know of any medicine that is of any particular benefit in Alzheimer's. If you have disturbed pa- tients, you have them under sedation, which only intensifies the problem there because people tend to become sensitized and to become habituated. Senator COHEN. How long have you been playing the violin? Dr. CHASE. I began when I was about 7 years of age. I had a teacher who was a very fine violinist, but he did not teach me how to even read music. He put up some music and he would play it, and I would play it back at him, and he thought I knew what I was doing. Senator COHEN. But, in addition to your profession as a doctor, I assume that you have played over the years for groups? Dr. CHASE. I have played over the years Christmas caroling on Christmas Eve. The whole neighborhood comes out and follows me. Senator COHEN. I was somewhat surprised when you said you didn't realize the therapeutic effect of music, having been a lifelong musician. Dr. CHASE. I only played at family gatherings and Christmas and events like that. I never tried to attach any medical connotation to it. I did buy a fiddle in Brisbane, Australia, and I took it to New Guinea during the campaign-places you never heard of, battles you never heard of. I was known there as the crazy American doctor who played the violin on the front lines. But it wasn't true. I never took the violin to the front lines. I played the violin in the rear areas. Senator COHEN. Thank you very much. It has been very helpful. Senator REID. We appreciate very much your patience and, most of all, your testimony. It has been enlightening. We look forward to working with you in the years to come. The final panel today will be experts in music and health. We will hear from Dr. Alicia Ann Clair, Dr. Frank Wilson, and Dr. Matthew Lee. Dr. Clair is from Topeka, KS; Dr. Wilson is from Danville, CA; and Dr. Lee is from New York City. We will first hear from Alicia Ann Clair. Please proceed.47 STATEMENT OF DR. ALICIA ANN CLAIR, TOPEKA, KS Dr. CLAIR. I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak withyou today to increase awareness of music therapy as a valid andefficacious treatment and health care service for older Americans.I am the Director of Music Therapy at the University of Kansasin Lawrence, KS, and a research associate at the Colmery-O'NeilVeterans Affairs Medical Center in Topeka, KS. Both these institu-tions are very long supporters of music therapy, but I speak not asa representative of either of those institutions today, but as a long-time practicing professional music therapist who has been workingwith and conducting research with elderly Americans since 1977.I began my clinical music therapy work with well elderly personsin developing and redeveloping their music skills to give them op-portunities to demonstrate their abilities and competencies to suc-ceed musically. Some of these people included people such as Nar-cissus Abella, who was a World War II veteran who survived theBataan Death March and who learned to play the clarinet when hewas 82 years old-something that he said he always wanted to do.Evangeline, a widow who lived in a farmhouse 15 miles fromtown-very isolated-learned to play the guitar in her early 70's,and said she used it to play away her blues and to play when shewas happy. She said it didn't really matter how it sounded becauseit was just the dog and her anyway, and it didn't matter what hethought. This lady later developed breast cancer. She had surgery. Shehad follow-up chemotherapy. The music therapy group was verysupportive of her during that time. That also helped to motivateher to get back into her social contacts, and she came back to joinus again. I also did music therapy programming with the frail elderly inresidential care homes. Here were people such as Grace and Ann,who both had strokes. They could play an autoharp together, butcould not play individually. There were others who seemed too de-pressed to socialize, but they sang when the music therapist con-ducted sessions. And they all danced in their own way.More recently I have conducted music therapy sessions with per-sons diagnosed with dementia and with their families. Music ther-apy has provided opportunities for social integration with peoplewho have really lost touch and who have become severely dysfunc-tional to bring them into the here and now. It seems to provide atime out from the terrors and the confusion that they suffer in de-mentia. It also gives families an opportunity to maintain contactwith their loved ones far into the late stages of the disease. Spouseshave played music with one another, they have danced, they havedrummed together. Lately Marie, the wife of Bill, after dancing for the first timewith him in music therapy, said, \"He held me in his arms. It is thefirst time in years that he has just held me.\"I have a short videotape with me today that shows the powerfuleffects of music in one of the patients with whom we have workedwho was severely regressed and confused.[Videotape presentation.]48 Dr. CLAIR. In conclusion, my clinical perceptions and research conclusions support the need for legislation and regulation that in- fluences the availability of music therapy services to older Ameri- cans and to other populations. It also supports the possibility of using Federal funds to conduct research projects that include dem- onstration projects, basic research, and clinical outcome research. A modest amount of Federal funds could be extremely helpful and have a major impact on the physical and mental wellbeing of a growing population of older Americans. Thank you.

Prior to institutionalization these persons' lives and their families are devastated entionally, socially, psychologically and financially. 3. Caregivers lose their health and their life quality in the care process 4 Lives of those afflicted and their caregivers will continually decline-there is no cure B .Music Therapy practice protocols have been developed. 1. These are successful with those from early through late stages of dementia. 2. These are designed to incorporate family caregivers into them.51 2 3. These can be used to train family caregivers to use music with their loved one afflicted with dementia, including dementia of the Alzheimee's type.C. Music Therapy is greatly appreciated by caregivers and families desperate for interventions. 1.

Caregivers need options for self-care including relaxation and stress managementthrough music. D. Caregivers need ways to maintain relationships with their loved ones for as long aspossible and music therapy can provide them.52 3 THERAPEUTIC USES OF MUSIC WITH THE ELDERLY Therapeutic uses of music throughout the life span have been incorporated into treatment since the beginning of recorded history. There was reference to them in ancient Greek literature, the Bible and other sources. Though not much is known of specific applications in those early times, a book written in the English language in the mid-1660's and finally published in 1729, presented the use of music as a therapeutic intervention (Gibbons & Heller, 1985). Its author discussed the use of music as therapy to 1) change and evoke moods, 2) bigger memories associated with the music, 3) influence and change physiological processes, and to 4) stimulate and sedate. This treatise was explicit about using music for persons even if they had no prior musical training or experience, and it stipulated designing the music to suit the needs of the individual person. This information is quite astounding when put in its historic perspective. At the time it was published in London, England. Handel had already lived in the city for 17 years, but he had not yet written the Messiah. Yet, these thrapeuic uses of music are incorporated into music therapy practice today. Literature indicates music has been used therapeutically in the United States since the turn of the century, and before. Music therapy began as a profession, however, in the Veterans Administration hospitals in the 1940's where it was incorporated into rehabilitation programs for American soldiers returning from World War E. By 1950 the National Association for Music Therapy, Inc. was established and colleges and universities across the country began offering degree programs to educate and train professional music therapists. The contemporary definition of music therapy, in its rather broad sense, is the therapeutic use of music to change behaviors. This use depends on careful assessments of individual consumer's therapeutic needs and their musical tastes and preferences. It is also based on the principles of musical influences on physiological, social and emotional behaviors. With these considerations music therapists use their expertise to design, implement and continually evaluate programs for individuals. These programs may include individual or group sessions or a combination of these. They usually also include learning therapeutic music skills to use away from the music therapy session so that independence, and self care is developed. But, whatever the design of the music therapy program, the ultimate goal is to meet the needs of the individual consumer in the most effectve, and efficient way and to promote and maintain that consumer's quality of life. Some Princdles of Music Therany Pervasiveness of Music Persons of all ages generally experience music frequently in their lives, many on a daily basis. Many persons use music to relax and some persons have such frequent uses of music that they listen to it virtually all day. Music is almost always used in the celebrations and rituals associated with important life events; i.e., birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, funerals and others. Music is also used to the set the environment for offices, work areas and to influence the mood of special occasions. With the other important uses of music, it is often a part of entertainment and is used to structure leisure time. The frequent uses of music have led many to refer to music as a universal phenomenon. While some musical elements, such as rhythm, tempo timbre, and others, are universally found, the types of music perferred, understood and used are not the same for all persons in all cultures. There are even differences in the same culture when preferences of the old and the young are compared. The types of music withn a community or even within a family fran that community may vary according to individuals' ages, backgrounds and experiences. Therefore, music is universal but it is not a universal language.53 4 Music which is preferred and most often used by individuals is the music which isintegrated into their lives. This music could be that which was popular during their young adultyears (Gibbons, 1977), that which was used in religious services and patioric ceremonies and thatwhich was used in other cultural and community contexts. Music which is not integrated into anindividual's fife may simply have no effect or may even be offensive resulting in inattention anddisengagement. It is the preftaed music which is most likely to stimulate cooperative responses inall persons. The type or types of preferred music may be determined by interviewing persons, or theirfamily members if they can no longer express themselves verbally. If interview responses areinconclusive or unavailable, it is possible to determine music preferences by using various types ofmusic and observing reactions. Facial expressions, body postures, vocalizations and other overtresponses to particular music will show either pleasure or discomfort associated with it. Fromthese overt behaviors conclusions concerning preferences can be drawn. PuQss for _sing Music with the Elderd Physical and Emotional Stimulation. Music can be used with elderly persons to evoke awide range of responses. Depending upon how it is structured, music can be sedative to promoterelaxation and calm or it can be stimulative to promote movement to other physical activity.The research literature indicates colealy that the definitions of sedative and stimulative musicaem individualized and there is no consistent agreement among listeners. What may be calming andquieting to one person may be disturbing and disquieting to another. Individuals with whom themusic is used must determine its sedative and stimulative effects.The sedative and stimulative qualities of music not only evoke calmness or activity, theyalso evoke other physical responses. Research with subjects in a wide range of ages has shownthat music can affect blood pressure, heart rate, respiraton, galvanic skin response, pupil dilation,discomfort and/or pain tolerance (Standley. 1986). These reactions to music differ from individualto individual, but there is no question that music isa powerful influence over physiologicalresponses. It may be these physical reactions that e the bases for quieting and active responses tosedative and stimulative music. These physiological responses to music may also be integral to emotional responses tomusic, But, whatever the reason, music influences moods and emotions, and there is a large bodyof literature which supports this fact. A particular emotion can be triggered by certain music for acertain individual and these emotional reactions to specific music seem relatively consistent for thatindividual. These emotional reactions for persons who are disabled and who cannot communicateverbally can be unpredictable and rem, therefore, discovered by chance unless persons or theirfamily members provide information about them. Once these specific reactions in a individual areknown, music can be used to facilitate a transition from one emotion to another or to stimulate anemotional response in someone with an otherwise flat affect. Music as Communication. As with all art forms, music is unique communication. What itconveys cannot be better done in any other way or by any other medium. This communicationmay be either through words of a song in a melodic context or it may be completely nonverbal,relying totally upon one or more musical elements. Using music with persons who aem nonverbalor who have communication deficits facilitates their social interaction with others. Music may bethe only medium through which some persons can interact with others and feel a part of a group.For example, a person who has severe dementia and who has not spoken in several years canshake a maraca or hit a drum in rhythm to music. Because this response is in rhythm, it can occurwithin the context of a rhythm ensemble; i.e., the person participates successfully with others. Themusic, therefore, provides the structure necessary for interacting with others. Through itsstricture music taps residual communication skills and abilities, even in those who have severedementia, which can be used for successful group participation. This success with others leads to54 5 feelings of belonging and of being needed which are so essential to well being and life quality. _tnotional E~sd= Since music can be used as a form of nonverbal communication, it is partculaly helpful as a form of expression for those who have limited or no verbal communication skills. Music may be used to express a wide variety of emotions which range from anger and frustration to affection and tenderness. These expressions can take the form of vocalinions which may or may not require words. They can also be formalized through instrument playing, physical movements and facial expressions which are acceptable within the music therapy frameworL Atsociations with Music, One of the aspects of music which makes it unique to each individual peon is the associations that person makes with a particular piece of music. The music mayprove ones of times, places and persons. The association may be direct or indirect. That is, the music may have been heard only in one context or situation and whenever it is heard it is a reminder of that particular moment in time. Or, a piece of music may have a certain style that is mome geneally associated wmith a time period in one's life. These associations may be very happy or very sad and even remorseful. They aem so individual that they aem impossible to predict, and one song that evokes smiles and apparent happiness forone person may trigger tears and apparent grief for another. As with music preferences, some information about a person's reactions to particular music may be obtained. Again, it is important to observe behavioral indications of eactions, whether they e verbal or nonverbal. Because of strong associations with it, music is often used as a stimulus for reminiscence and life review in elderly persons. Music which was part of the participants' experiences throughout their lifetimes can be selected for this purpose. Observation shows that persons who have lost the communication skills to discuss their lifetimes, can sometimes still sing the songs which were part of their earlier lives and part of their young adult years. But, when those singing skills aem also gone, the person may continue to enjoy hearing the songs, particularly if they are sung by someone sitting close who makes eye contact and communicates an attitude of acceptance. MuSic and Relaxation. Because music has the capacity to affect physiological responses and because of pleasant associations persons may have with it, music can be a source of relaxation. The proper music played as background in certain settings can promote relief from tension and anxiety. It can quiet agitation and promote comfort In addition, singing or playing music can function to divert attention from stressors and promote relaxation through relief from stress. Music in Fntertainment and Leisure Some persons, including some elderly persons, have great amnounts of unstructured time in their day. Music provides meaningful, purposeful activities which ae enjoyable and constructive uses of time. If the person is emotionally or physically disabled, or if the person has a dementa, music can be used by the caregiver to provide diversion from routiutized activities and as a pleasant way to interact with their care receivers. Music used in entertainment and leisure can include singing, playing or listening activities which are structured around familiar music. Sitting in a chair listening to 20 or 30 minutes of music once or twice a day can provide some opportunity for purposeful activity which requires little effort or skill. While listening, an individual may sing along with certain songs, may tap a foot or a knee in rhythm with the music or may play an instrumental accompaniment Music videos provide another enjoyable and constructive use of leisure time. These may include video tapes of musical shows, movies which feature song and dance numbers, musical television programs such a Lawrence Welk or Hee Haw and any other musical programming the person has enjoyed. While music can provide constructive, meaningful uses of leisure time, it can also lose its effectiveness if used continually. With the constant use of music, individuals become attenuated and lose interest. Consequently, the music becomes ineffective. If the use of music is interrupted periodically throughout the day with silence or other activities, the music maintains its effectiveness in focusing attention, providing sensory stimulation, offering diversion from routine and providing55 6 meaningful uses of kisure time Why Music WINks MuscsEkzlib Music activities can be designed to provide success for persons ofvarious physiological, psychological and social response levels even when they are severelydysfuncitonaL Successful experiences are difficult for severely dysfunctional persons, yet, theyare essential to feelings of well being. If a sevaely dysfunctional person cannot experiencesuccess in a music activity, then it is the music acvity which is not properly designed and not thefunctioning level of the individual which prohibits the success. Success in music activities can be defined in a variety of ways depending upon the skillsand abilities of the individual for whom they were designed. Successful musical experiences canrange form sitting quietly in a chair to actively playing an instrument or singing. For sone,success is defined as staying in the room while a music activity is conducted; for others, success isdefined as singing an original verse of a song. Mug is Struc dan d. Omu Th ru me. Music is structured and, therefore,predictable. It has predictability whether or not it is familiar because one beat always follows thenexL When the music is familiar, then not only the beats follow in a predictable manner but othermusical elements also occur predictably. These elements include, among others, melody lines,rhythm patterns, harmonies, textures, timbres and dynamics. Music can only occur through time and it is perceived only through time. Te predictabilityinherent in music provides for structured time. It is this structure that provides opportunities foranxiety control in those who can no longer maintain their own structure. The predictability alsoprovides opportunities for cooperation with others in reality oriented activities.Cooperation with others leads to conjoint parncnimmda in activities with them. This resultsin relief from isolation. Opportunities to participate with others are rare in persons who are isolateddue to their inabilities to initiate or respond to most social interactions. Through structuredopportunities for cooperation individuals can accept responsibility for their behaviors in the activityand for their behaviors which relate to others. They become aware of what they contribute andthey become aware of others. This awareness of others is quite rare in severely dysfunctionalpersons including those with dementia, but it is necessary for their feelings of belonging which areessential to their well being. Music lbrn with the Fldedv An Ovview It has long been known that opportunities for social interaction and integration intoconmunities contributes to the quality of life for most persons. Sone persons maintain theiropportunities for social interaction as they age, but some cannot due to caregiving responsibilitiesof a spouse or other family member, chronic physical disabilities, poor health, inadequateresources and other reasons. Those persons who have fewer and fewer opportunities for socialinteractions tend to become progressively more isolated. With isolation and feelings ofhelplessness there is a concomitant feeling of depression (Russell, et al., 1980). This depressionincreases inversely with increased losses of independence, hone, friends, community, mobility,health and with other losses and disappointments. Hanser (1989 and 1990a) has demonstrated thatmusic therapy techniques ae very effective for older persons with depression. She provided amusic listening program which served as a stimulus for relaxation and pleasant visual images. Sheed that these elderly persons had a relief from anxiety symptoms and depression while theirselfesteem improved as they participated once weekdy for one hour over an eight-week musictherapy program (Hanser, 1990b). Music has always been a viable medium for bringing people together, young and old, forsocial interaction in a wide variety of contexts. The approach, however, with most persons is touse music in traditional ways, such as instrumental performances as soloists and as members ofinstrumental and vocal ensembles, church choirs and other choral singing opportunities. While56 7 these traditional methods are viable for those who have had opportunities to study music as young persons and who have used these skills throughout their life times, there are often not entry opportunities for those who would like to develop skills as musical performers in later, or even lam life. There is evidence that these older persons are not satisfied with their current musical skill levels and would like better ones. They are also concerned about good musical products (Gibbons, 1982). They are not pleased with mediocre performances or instruction and are quick to respond with verbal displeasure when they perceive either. They are sensitive, as they should be, about their dignity and do not respond well to situations in which they am spoken \"down to\" or in which they feel they are treated without respect appropriate for an adult Therefore, music programs which include. toy\" instruments, kitchen pots and wooden spoons and songs of childhood, along with \"silly\" costumes and any other demeaning activities ant totally unacceptable. When given a supportive environment in which they are allowed and encouraged to develop, there is also research and practice evidence that older persons have the abilities to learn musical skills through their late life years (Gibbons, 1982). When they participate in these programs focused on musical skill development they demand challenging instruction and work eagerly to improve their performances. As a result they can learn new skills, or can relearn those acquired much earlier in life, quite successfully (Gibbons, 1984). Even when these persons are so frail that they must reside in a care home, research shows they still have the abilities to learn new musical skills, provided they have sufficient congnitive functioning (Gibbons, 1983a, 1983b). So, what about music performance contributes therapeutically to elderly persons' quality of life? When asked this question those who use music make comments which include: \"When I play/sing music with others, I have an opportunity to work together with them to do something I really enjoy.\" Or, \"Music gives me a great excuse to call someone and get together\". And, \"Music just makes me feel so good, especially when our group sounds great!\" Or, \"I use music to pass the Mime, I have a lot of it on my bands and I don't get around Wm I used to. Music gives me a great way to fi my day.\" One 82-year-old man said, \"I like to perform the music for others and I think it is important to do it in nursing homes, too, for those people who am less fortunate than- us.\" One widow woman who lived alone in a stone farm hous in Kansas said, \" When I feel bad I play my guitar and wail the blues and when I feel good, I do more joyful songs.\" She said that it didn't matter how her music sounded, because the singing and playing was important to her- besides, she said, the dog kind of seemed to like it. These comments all came from people who learned musical skills when they were over 70, and some were over 80, years old. They continued regular music rehearsals and performances after the program in which they learned the skins was discontinued. They were able to develop enough independence and confidence through the music therapy program that they successfully organized themselves into a well determined group of musical performers. Mieraporc Music Provrarn for the hmalyde The goals for life quality change according to individual needs and desires, and am conjointly dependent on the resources available. An extensive review of the literature indicates music is effective in a wide range of programming (Gibbons, 1988). The focus of this presentation is the therapeutic ue of music with the elderly, a population that has a broad range of needs and concerns which shift as their lives change with age. Music with the Well Fldeflv My experience with elderly persons and the therapeutic uses of music began with an experimental program I developed at the University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas in 1977 for well, elderly persons who were interested in developing music skills. In this program elderly persons studied individually or in small groups with a music instructor to either develop new musical skills or to relearn tho skils learned much earlier in life, sometimes more than 50 years earlier. These skills were applied ins weey group music session in which as many as 25 to 30 people participated together insa vocalftnstrwlental ensemble. As individuals' skills developed in57 8 the music sessions, they were incoorated at a comparable skill level in the music ensemble. Thismusic ensemble gave 10 to 15 public performances each year of its existence in the Lawrence,Kansas community, and was invited to perform at the Kansas Govences Conference on Aging in1979. This music therapy program was free to participants and was ran entirely by volunteerinstructors. Without funding and with demands on time, the program was discontinued. Itserved, however, as a useful resource in the community for eight years. Its goals were focused onlife enrichment and intellectual stimulation, the development of social/nusical netwoks, self-esteem and feelings of worth through successful experiences and opportunities for developing llfesatisfaction. This preliminary wik using music wih well eldey has demonstrated that music cancontribute to the life quality of this populati. Further study of this area is neededto rovidemore comprehensive knowledge of the uses of music in personal developmeet and flinens. m7he Omnmically I Elderly at Home Most elderly persons do not require full time residential care and live at home. Many ofthese older persons are physically fit and active in a wide range of social contacts, but othersbecome isolated at home because of various disabling diseases and physical changes. Many ofthese conditions become chronic and lead, eventually, to terminal illnesses.Music therapy has long been a viable therapeutic approach with frail elderly in residentialcare facilities (Gibbons, 1988), and these applications are also possible in individuals' privatehomes. Problems come with access and availability, however. Programs to train family membersor volunteers to use music therapy services with their elderly loved ones would be economicallyfeasible, but these programs are in the conceptual stages. If family members/volunteers could betrained to implement programs under the supervision of a music therapist, music programmingcould be effective and efficient in the home setting. In addition, the music could providetuities for families to interact around activities for which the ch ically ill, elderly memberIS capable socially, physically and psychologically.As an alternative to residential care home placement, many families are consideringmaintaining their elderly loved one t home and placing them in day care during thte wok day. Daycare can also provide respite fir caregivers who need some time to perform householdresponsibilities or tojusi rest from the bumdens of caregiving. Music therapy programs can beimplemented in day care similar to the ones provided in residential care home facilities. They mayor may not involve the individual's family members.Yet, stil other chronicaly in elderly persons are afflicted with a telminal disease andchoose to spend their last days in their oh n houes. Music therapy is new in the area of terminalillness management and treatmnent. Some preliminary clinical work has shown that music canprovide diversion from chronic pain and provide for reaxation for those who ate in the late stagesofa terminal illness. Besides pain manageternt and diversion, music therapy probably has animport an r e m nd/or eating chronic illness as a medium which pvidesopportunities for families to deal with the emotional impact of the disease. It enables families tointeract and reminisce together whie includiingrtheoill family member. Music can provide a meansfor communicating those feelings and emotions which are painfiul, but also those which areassociated with happier times throughout the family history. Through song writing and otherapproaches, music therapy can serve to record and communicate family information and emotionsand can draw the family members together to share itAgain, the full impact of music with the ill elderly as home will be known throughadditional study and research. Preliminary work has shown potential, but this area is generallyunexplored. Music Therapy with Frail Elderly Care Home Residntq In the eight years the music therapy /music development program was implemented for well58 9 elderly, I was also developing other music therapy programming in residential cam facilities, otherwise known as nursing homes. These programs focused on the maintenance of musical skills in those who were no longer living in their own homes, and the use of those skills to provide opportunities for social interaction, cooperation with others, awareness of self and others, and feelings of belonging. Though this population had clear indications of musical abilities (Gibbons, 1983a; 1983b), they had some difficulties executing them (Clair, 1991) probably because of their serious physical, and sometimes emotional disabilities. Consequently, these elderly persons were not usually candidates to learn new music performance skills. They did, however, learn new ways to incorporate the skills they had into new music activities and contexts and often did not require the amount of supervision or assistance that care home staff indicated they needed (Oak, 1990). For them the program design entailed participation in small groups of 6 to 10 persons once or twice a week and involvement in a large, all resident, community music therapy session at least once weekly. Small group activities included using music to 1) reminisce and subsequently discuss life satisfaction and life quality, 2) manage stress and sleeplessness, 3) interact musically together in an ensemble, 4) stimulate the senses through auditory, tactile and visual media and to 5) motivate involvement and integration with others. Goals were often centered around the development of maintaining as much control and independence in life as possible through decision making, feeling needed by others, sensory and cognitive awareness, social integration into the care home community, self-esteem and feelings of respect and dignity, and satisfaction with current life. Music Therapy with Elderly Persons with Dementia and their Families Estimates indicate that half the elderly persons in the United States who require residential care suffer from an irreversible dementia called Alzheimer's disease (Reisberg, 1983; Schneider & Emr, 1985). This disease is on the upswing and epidemiological studies in the United States, Great Britain and Scandinavia estimate that five to seven percent of those persons over age 65 and 20 percent of those over age 80 have it (Mortimer & Hutton, In Press). With this diagnosis individuals can live 7 to 10 years, and sometimes more, with a disease that is terminal. As these persons progress through the disease, they become more and more dysfunctional. As a consequence, their quality of life and the quality of life of those who care for them deteriorates continually. Family caregivers become isolated due to the strain of constant care when the person with dementia is maintained at home. And, even when the individual must be moved to a residential care facility, the family caregiver has the burden of emotional and financial support These persons continue to experience the losses of social contacts in the community suffered through months and years of isolation. They also are at risk for physical illnesses (Light & Leibowitz, 1989) and depression (Boss, et al., 1990) due to the stresses of caregiving. The consequences of this disease, and other dementias, am devastating. In the last four years I have been developing, along with my colleague, Barry Bernstein, RMT-BC, music therapy practice protocols and research with elderly persons diagnosed with dementias, primarily of the Alzheimer's type. In the last year we have expanded our work to include family members and have consulted with colleague Susan Tebb, MSW to develop a music therapy program forpersons with dementia and their spouse caregivers. The focus of the earliest work was the development of programs for those persons who were so severely regressed that they could no lnger function in their homes, and they had to reside in a care facility where their needs for constant came and safety could best be met. This work included the development of music therapy programs which have involved these persons in participation with one another and with family members who visited the facility. Based on three years of clinical work, a music therapy practice protocol was developed. It will be published along with a music therapy practice protocol developed by Hanser for persons who ame mildly afflicted with the disease in the early stages (Clair & Hanser, In Press). Most of the severely regressed patients with whom we wark ame so debilitated that many of them do not speak, and if they do their speech is unintelligible. They ame also emotioally labile and their emotional responses ame often not appropriate or predictable. Mariy of them do not have59 10 bowel or bladder control, some of them need help feeding themselves, they all need help withbathing and dressing and they are not going to get better. They will get more and more isolatedand withdrawn, they will forget how to walk and eventually how to eat and how to swallow. Theywill probably get a respiratory disease and die. Until then, they will require complete andcontinuous care to merely exist The quality of these patients' lives will continue to decline. They do not remember thenames of their children or their spouses. They no longer respond to the family dog when it isbrought to visit at the hospital, even though it was ace an endeared pet. But, they sil seem torecognize a familiar face even though their ability to learn and remember names has long gone.In the music therapy sessions, these persons play/make music together using percussioninstruments and upon initial admission to the hospital some of them still sing. Eventually theybecome debilitated until they can no longer sing but they can and do still play a rhythm instrument(Clair & Bernstein, 1990) They also participate in moving their bodies in rhythm to the music, todance at first, and later after much deterioration, in rhythmic arm swinging in response to music.Eventually they participate by just staying in the room and making eye contact Even this verybasic level of involvement is significant since these patients get to the point they can no longerparticipate in any other activities. One patient, who had gotten to the point that he could no longercommunicate in any way, still came to the music therapy sessions. He always made eye contactwhen the music therapist sat close by and sang to him. Eventually he became very ill and washospitalized with a critical respiratory infection He appeared to be sleeping most of the time butwhen his wife sang to him, he opened his eyes and looked at her. On the last day he lived she waswith him in his hospital room, she sang his favorite hymn, he opened his eyes and looked at herfor the last time. It was, she said, something she will never forget-a moment that happenedbecause she sang to him. The persons with severe dementia with whom we have worked participate best in rhythmactivities that involve vibracdle stimulation, ar the vibration that results faom percussive sounds(Cair & Bernstein, 1990a; 1990b; Unpublisied Paper b). The most viable activity to date hasbeen the use of fat drums which can he held in the hand orsplaced in the lap and played either withhands or maglets. The drum playing seems rather reflexive in patients who are severely regressedin the disease. They quickly begin to strike the drum when itns handed to them, even if they havehad no prior experience wit it.t This drum playing, when dune with simple repeated beats, doesnot seem to require a high level of cognitive orgaezanonf But, even very regressed persons cancognitively organize wel enough to learn new rhythm patterns, to imitate a pattern played by someoneelse or p of unusua inthis eponse (Cair& 1989).These peons illustrate wel the principle that al persons can participate in music proien it isadjusted to suit their functional behavir s.The clinical work we have done has indicated that persons with seers deterioalton due todementias can learn to participate in music activities particulaty when they are indcuded in smallgroups of five to seven persons for a period of several weeks. Their responses in the small groupsseem to generalize and they can eventually participate in activities in much larger groups; i~e., whenthe entire hospital unit is included, 26 to 28 persons. Even in the smal gonup actvites, however, persons seem to be somewhat agitated initially. This may be due to the threat of a newenvironment, the change in routine or the presentation of a new activity. Once the individualsexperience success with music in the smal groups, they settle down and participate for as long as 30 minutes, a duration of attention that is quite unusual in this popuation (Clair & Bernstein,199c). The nurses on the unit where the sessions are held say that the ony time the patients allcome into the day room and sit down is when the music therapists come to do a session. Nursingstaff and spouses who observe the music therapy sessions say that patients seem more alert duringand following the music therapy sessions. They also say that the patlents tedto settle down withmusic. There is no research which indicates music has lasting effects on persns with dementiabut preliminary observations indicate it is an area wothy of study. An initial study of the effects ofmusic on agitated behaviors did not provide definitive results (Clair & Bernstin, UnpublishedPaer a), and, subsequently, this is an area that requires further research.60 11 In the last year the music therapy work has expanded to include spouses or odtr family caregivers in the sessions. Couples participate in groups in which singing, drum playing and dancing are programmed. These caregivers have told us that in music therapy their loved ones have reacted much the way they did in the past and that they could see snatches of who these people used to be. They were quite exited that we could tap the residual skis and abilities along with the personality traits they had watched disappear fore their eyes. One wife told us after dancing with her husband for the first time n many years, \"Oh,he held me in his arms. It has been such a long time since he just held me.\" The music providedthesructure in which he could hold her and resume some of his behaviors from long ago, the behaviors that were such an integral part of the intimacy of their relationship. The parts that should still be there, but most of the time they are not, because her husband has a dementia, probably of the Alzheimer's type. Most recently, Barry Bernstein, Susan Tebb, MSW and I tested our music therapy practice protocol for caregivers with persons who were diagnosed with dementia, probably of the Alzheimers type, who stil resided in their own homes. These persons were living with spouses who were their primary caregivers and who partcpated with them in the music therapy programming. Four caregivers and their spouses diagnosed with dementia in the middle stages participated successfully together in singing, rhythm drumming and dancing activities, for 30 minutes each week for six weeks. The afflicted spouses in these sessions were still living at home, but were very dysfunctional. They needed help and/or supervision for even the most basic activities of daily living, i.e., eating, bathing, dressing and going to the toilet They could no longer participate as a viable member of the couple, but could still be maintained at home as long as they had constant supervision. They could no longer participate in couple activities. Even so, when familiar songs were introduced in the sessions, all participants attempted to sing for some or all of the songs. They responded particularly well to playing drums, even though they had no prior experience playing them. The persons with dementia took the drums wilingly and used them to interact, playing rhythmically within the group. When the dancing portion of the session came, afflicted spouses took their caregiving spouses in their arms, the ladies tucked their heads under the chins of their husbands, and they danced to big band music of their young adult years.... just as they had done in their early years together. Caregivers reported that they were using some of the activities at home with their spouses. One lady said that she and her husband had begun dancing in the kitchen, an activity they had long given up doing in public. It is clear through our clinical work and research that music influences positively the activity levels of persons with dementia, even when they are severely regressed. Even though they do not participate in other activities, they can still play an instrument rhythmically and they can still dance. If they have had no experience with dancing, prior to the onset of the disease, they can still swing arms and move their feet in rhythm to the music. It is the music that seems to integrate them into activity with others. It reduces their isolation for a time, though it may be only a short time, and consequently it influences the quality of their lives. At the same time, it provides opportunities for family caregivers to particpate with their afflicted family members in a purposeful, productive way. Through well-designed and implemented music therapy activities, they can again make contact with their loved ones. They can use the music to relate positively with whatever residual skills are left We think it is very possible that spouses and other family caregivers can learn to use music with their afflicted family members provided they have the appropriate training and supervision. We have established practice protocols, for both severely deteriorated and moderately deteriorated individuals, which could provide the framework for the training. With this training services can be extended to a much broader portion of the population afflicted with the disease. It is even possible that such training programs could make these services available to those in rural areas. Thus training, integrated with research to study its effectiveness, can make approaches to therapeutic uses of music available to families that are devastated by one of the most dreaded diseases in this country, dementia.61 12 Music Thenny for the Caregivcr There is a growing body of literature which describes the terrible devastation suffered by those families, a particularly by those older caregivers of persons with dementia.. This literatureindicates stress, depression, poor physical care, emotional distress and other factors which lead tothe breakdown of health, life satisfaction and uality of life. The music therapy jxoject weconducted in the past year has led to some p m program design for caregwevrs. Thetherapeutic uses of music to manage stress, promote relaxation and provide opportunities for selfdevelopment and fulfillment are areas for study and program development This work should be a priority along with the use of music in the treatment of persons with dementia. I give this testimony as a professional music therapist, and I do not speak for theUniversity of Kansas or for the Veterans Affairs Medical Center where I now do music therapy practice and research. This testimony is therefore limited to the work of one individual and someof the professional literature which supports it. There is much more research which points clearlyto the positive, effects of therapeutic uses of music on the elderly. Even with its limited scope, theresearch and clinical practice reported here have demonstrated that music has therapeutic effects onelderly persons, and sometimes these effects are quite remarkable. Additional clinical work andresearch are needed to more fully describe the musical characteristics and the effects of music onelderly persons and their families so that appropriate programming may be designed andimplemented in the most effective and efficient ways.

RESEARCH AREA ONE The Effect of Music Therapy Interventions on Neurological Functioning, Communication Skills, and Pbyslcal Rehabilltation in Older Adults PXn: -Tf influence of music on brain wave activity in the severely regressed paat with demed. A large body of literature has exasirned the effect of music on brain processes (Gates and Btadshaw. 1977). in denmentia patients, observation and clinical case studies have shown that persons in the late stage of dementia, isnduding dementia of the Alzheimer's type, are unresponsive toall stimuli except cic. (Nnrberg, et al., 1986). This study would examine, through the use of EREG mea smennt , the nosdidistynfbrtdn a ctivi ty of sevaerel regressed dementia patients in response to musical stimuli, which would indicate whether or not the patient has potential for response to music thea~py interventions. :t 2 \"Musical responses as indicators of function and dyafunetin in late stag Dementia of the Alzeinni's type is charactrized by predictable decline in a variety of functional areas. Research hus indicated that this decline may manifest itself via musical behavior (Clir and Bernstein, 1990). Ciinical observations have shown that declines in skills such as singing and dancing may progress at a slower rate than decines in other areas of cognitive funcsonin A longitudinal tc in this study would construct a profile of musical responses rru tstic of each stage of the disease. Such a profile would assist the music therapy pracditioner as planning intervention stnuegies appropriate for patiants at each of these effective in reestablishing cortttnucan skills in youngerpopulaUons. (Lucia, 1987). Pilot tests using this techsnique with older stroke victims have beenpostve. Controlled studies using adaptations of Melodic lIonation Tberapy and other muitc therapy interventons are needed to test effects on articul, breath contol and c at'i inboth imsttuonahzed and community older adults with conditions affectingcommtunlcauion.

Studies could be developed which would investigatephysiologicajhseurological processes operating to produce this phenomenon. Pmposed St-dy fl6: 'The effect of music on gait truining fo those in soke rehabilitationprogratw.\". A. Music has been shown to be effective in prolonging physical activity, facilitadngefficient muscle fmrisg, reducing the perception of pain, and equalizing strde width and length.(Staum, 1983). Music may be effective in improving the gait of stroke victim with partialparalysis by facilitating endurance in physical activity and equi-distance of footfalls, and byimproving the older adults rmental attitude about rehabilitation. The effect of rhythmic gait trainingon prevention of falls is also of imterest. B. Rhythm, in the form of metronome beats and musical patteras, has been used as apacing signal to influence the timing, velocity, cadence speed and rhythmicity of movement.(Thaut 1991). The effectiveness of this technique should be compared to standard physicaltherapy protocols in the rehabilitation of both gait and upper extemity disonder. The timing and magnitude of EMO activity in response to rhythmnic signals is another area for investigation. Proposed Study x7:'\"The effect of music and rhythm in the rehabiltation of older adults.\" A. Event-related brain potentials are begsning to be sslnxed in the perception of auditoryrhythm. New research would measure ERPs while older and younger adults I) listen to auditorybeat, 2) perform a motor task without beat, 3) perform a task with rhythmic cue, 4) perform with an intenmittent anticipatory beat, 5) follow an irregular rhythm, 6) follow rhythms which graduallyspeed up or slow down. B. People afflicted with Parkinson's disease have great difficulty with motor initiation andtermination. Efficient techniques of cueing motor behavior are in great need. The effects ofauditoty rhythmic stimulus \"sensory trigger\" cues to facilitate the initiation of movement in thosewith Parkinson's disease must be studied. C. Though basic research has been done on the effects of music on muscle relaxation(Scartelli, 1984), there is need to study the interaction between the auditory system and the motorsystem.

Your full statement will be made part of therecord. We'll now hear from Dr. Lee. STATEMENT OF MATHEW LEE, M.D., NEW YORK, NY Dr. LEE. Senator Reid and Senator Cohen and Senator Pryor, Iam grateful for this opportunity to testify this morning concerningthe relationships of music, medicine, and rehabilitation medicine.Currently I serve as Professor and Acting Chairman of the RuskInstitute of Rehabilitation Medicine, New York University; andalso as Adjunct Professor of Music. Recently I edited a book enti-tled, \"Rehabilitation, Music, and Human Well-being.\" The lateHoward A. Rusk, in his preface to this book, wrote, \"To rehabilita-tion medicine, it adds a new and vibrant dimension, and to pa-tients, a holistic approach to care.\"Anecdotal evidence and personal, clinical experience acknowl-edge the major role music and the creative art therapies plays inthe healing process. What is exciting today is that we have methods that can meas-ure the physiological and the biochemical effects of music. For ex-ample, at New York University it appears that through magneticimaging we have located an area of the brain which deals withsinging, separate from the speech center.We note that patients, when you play music that they like, willhave endorphin levels increased. That perhaps explains why thereis pain abatement. Also, if one needs surgery and we play themusic that they enjoy pre-, during, and post-surgery, one would re-quire less pain medications and less anesthesia.As documented, falls, respiratory problems, physical rehabilita-tion, and chronic pain of the elderly impact greatly on medicalcosts. Cost containment and cost-effectiveness are major issues.I strongly believe that with current methodologies and technol-ogies in music we can-one, maintain functional independence athome; two, preclude and prevent hospitalization and, if hospital-ized, to reduce stay, in addition to decreasing drug utilization andto improve cognition in our elderly and young.To achieve the above so that music can be a part of the main-stream of medicine, systematic research through demonstrationprojects, basic research, and certainly clinical outcome researchmust be done. Current attitudes concerning the elderly serve to set minimallevels of aspirations, although the overwhelming evidence clearlyindicates that this view is wrong, that this view is unfair, and con-trary to the facts. Music and music therapy enhance the functional capabilities ofthe elderly, as well as to raise their level of aspiration and poten-tial to more realistic levels. I cannot think of anyone who could more eloquently articulatethe role that music plays than my friend and your colleague, thelate Senator Jacob Javitz. In his keynote address during the FourthInternational Symposium of Music and Rehabilitation-which wasto be his last public appearance-he states, \"This is a unique ther-72 apy and is a great boon to the disabled, as it should be, and it must be seriously undertaken as an element of medicine.\" I thank the Committee for inviting me to testify today.

Herbert Zaretsky, PhD, Administrator, Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, New York University Medical Center74 America is getting grayer. By the year 20t0. with the maturation of baby boomers. the population of older Americans is projected to rise dramaticaily. Older Americans as a group have lioer economic status than other adults In our society. This largely results from changes In status and loss of earnings associated with aging. More than In any other age group, cost reduction and cost effectiveness are vital Issues here. While acute health problems were predominant at the beginning of the century. chronic conditions are now the more prevalent health problem for the elderly. In the main, these conditions can be prevented, or at least their process slowed a great deal. In t195. approximately 5.2 million Americana iS or ofder were midly-to-severetydisabled and needed assistivetechnology and special aids to maintaintheir Independence. This figure is expected to reach 7.3 million by the year 2000. These demographic data cannot but result in a growing demand for specialized health care tor the elderly, with emphasis on prevention and non- Invasive long-term therapies. Indeed, a patticularity of the field of geriatncs is that It requires a team of health care providers who wort as a team in a large array of settings -not only in the hospital, but in the home as well. There Is. to date, grossly Inadequate training and education in the field of geriatrics in this country. This Is often compensated for by trained non-medical allied health personnel. Although rehablitation technology has been widely used and attempts to alleviate the adverse effects of disability. I has not generally been focused on solving the problems of elderly disabled Individulis. Studies show that no more than halt of them use their prescribed aids Frailty and lack of muscle strength render it more difficult to provide adequate ads to this group. Many more factors of a behavioral. psychosocial and emotional nature also come Into play: the sdower pace of teaming. requiring far more repetitions that could be perceived as tedious; the frequent decrease in self-esteem and ire satisfaction; an Increase in negative outlook on tie and self-ageism. Therapy has been clinically found to be most heiptiu In alleviating these factors and reversing their trend. Rendering assistive technoiogy more interactive with frequent audiovisual feedback is a redl breakthrough In this eact. Orthopedic surgical patients over age 5it, primariy with hip fractures, white only 3405% of total hospital admissions, generate 50% of total hospital costs. The cost in direct care for hip tractures Is 57 bolion or more per year. Falls are the most important determinant of fracture risk. There is a plethora of factors that may lead to tails, the most important being slower reaction time, decreased balance, and decreased proprioception and coordination These factors have been proven very responsive to music therapy interventions such as rhythmic auditory stimuli. stimulation of synchronous movement patterns through music, etc. It Is common knowledge that the use of exercise in the elderly is an important factor in the maintenance of health: 'Exercise may not add years to their lives, but it can add bde to their years.- In 1955, a national health surnvey found that regular appropriate exercise is uncommon among persons age = >65 years. Indeed. exercising can be both tedious and painfut resulting in the wlhidrawal of many elderly from such routines. Music was found beneficial in distracting their attention and raIsing their threshold to pain, thereby making repetitie therapeutic movements more meaningful and acceptable to them. New Yotk University has maintained a strong commitment to music therapy over three decades, most evident In the dose alliance that exists between the music therapy program and the Medical Center. The Howard A. Rusk Institute of Rehabiltation Medicine, an integral component of NYU Medical Center, is the worids first facility devoted entirely to rehabilitation medicine, and has sened as a model for rehablitation centers throughout the country and the world. The therapeutic recreation stall, numbering more than 15, scme as faculty for comprehensive music therapy clinical internshipsh Current research projects at the Rusk Institute Include exploration Into the psychodynareic elements of the music therapy process, as well as the creation of a music-based modular computer network aihing to promote Independence In the eideriy population, prevent the occurrence of falls, and maintain physical and mental fitness. The author has pioneered In the introduction of diagnostic medical tools such as bkofeedback and themnography for music therapy clinicians, enhancing their ability to pertorm objective measurements and research He established the first center for the use of computer-music systems in the music therapy process at Goldwater Memorial Hospital. He also has collaborated to sponsor three precedent-setting conderences In this tield spanning a ten-year period, and Is now co-organizing MecArt Instemational s First World Congress on Arls and Medicine, to be held in New York City February 26-March 1, 1992. Although clinical experience and many anecdotal and sporadic studies all confirm the benefits of music therapy in preventing potentially fatal conditions. enhancing patients' well-being, shortening their hopital stay and increasing their independence thereafter, many longitudinal double blind controlled studies are now necessary to produce scientific evidence. This task Is nowadays greatly enhanced by the avalablity of objective measurement tels. It Is our opinion that a significant effort should be made at the level of the federal govermment to encourage research in this area. As America becomes greyer. this research well affect an ever-growing number of its citizens. In these days of economic hardship and escalating health care costs. the search for ahemative non-invasive and less costy therapies should be a necessary focus of legislators. RFPs based on the priority area of therapeutic effects of music and the creative arts therapies are long overdue. Sufficient evidence has been gathered through pilot- and case studies to warrant such a step. More than 100 music therapists nationwede have obtained a Ph.D. degree and are hrlly trained In scholady and academic research, and should be encouraged to pursue a career in this lieid. Upon publication of the first such RFP In the Federal Register, no doubt a large number of competitive research grant proposals will be submated. thus corroborating the above. Planning should be undertaken towards the establishment of a Center for Music in Medicine, as part of the National Institute on Aging or the National Institute of Chitd Health and Development. with 5s own separate funding appropriation. The stae of the Rusk Institute would be honored to same as part of the planning commitee75 A. BACKGROUND During the last two decades, the number of Americans age 65 and older has increased by 56%,compared to an increase of only 19% for the under-6S Ib3.000 persons per month marked their 6bth birthday. At the beginntng at this century. less then 1 In 10 Americans was 55 and over and 1 In 25 was 65 and aver By 198e, 1 Is 5 Americans was at least 56 years did and I In 8 eas at least 65. Between l935 and 2050. the toel U.S. population Is projectedto increase by 33%, whge thin Increase we 200% for the 55 pus popuation. By 2010. wIth the maturationat baby boomers, the population of older Americans I projected to rise dramaticafly; 5 In 4 oa the totalpopulation wii be at least 55. and I In 7 wvd be at least 65 years ad. The elderly populatbn is also growing oder. In 986, 41% o0 this populationas age 75 and oder. It is projected that by the year 2000, 50% wl be 75-plus. According to the re80 census, there are 3.2 mDleon people In New York State wiho are 66 or older. More than a mllon reside In the New York metropolitan area. Today. Individuats over age 75 comprise the fastest growing segment o0 the populatlon.The disability rate In this age group is 8times greater than that olhe under-45 age group In addition, older persons are much more likely to have multiple chronic ernesses and more severe disablities. More than 40percent oa all disabled persons In the United States are over age sixty (Kemp el at, 198j). Today the non-while and Hispanic populations have a smaiier proportion ol elderly than the white. In Ie86. 13% of whites were 65 or over, compared to onry B% of non-whiles and 5% of Hispanics. The difference In a result of higher fentility for the non-white and Hispanic populations. These proportiona are expected to remain relatively stable during the nent two decades. In the eady paur oa the nest century, however. the pnoportion of elderly is enpected to Increase at a higher rate for the non-white (265%) and theHispanic (530%) populations, than for the white population (97%) (Melcher et al.). Older Americans usa group. have a lower eomic status than other adults in our society. This largely results Irom changes In status often associoted with aging. In retirement, elderly persons loseearnings and become talent Instead upon social security benelits supplemenled with pensions and theassets they have accumulated over their liletimes. With limited potential to improve their Income throughworkm older persons become economically vunnerable to circumstances over which they have no control:the loss of a spouse. deterioration of their health and sell-sudficency, social security and Medicarelegislation, and Inflation. Compared strictly on the basis of monetary Income, persons 65 and older, onaverage, receive substantinily less Income than those under 65. In 19865 the mednu income of families withheads age 65 or elder was Sl9e932. about 62% at the median income oa lamilies with heads age 25 to e4($32.368). In the same year. 12.4% ol persons 65 and aider had Incomes below the poverny level, comparedIo 10.8% of those age 1a to 64. The oldest among the elderly (65 plus) have signilicanty lower monetaryIncmes than those who are 65 to 84 years (Melcher et al.). Black and Hispanic elderly have substantially lower monetary Incomes than their white counterparts.In 986, the median Income a Mack mates age 65 pIus ($6757) was 56% o0 white males ($12.131) and thatoa Hispanic males of the same age (57,369) was 61% of white males. Black and Hispanic women also had lower median incomes than their white counterparts. The median Income of back women age 65 plus($4,509) was 67% of white women (S6.738): that of Hispanic women oa the same age (S4.583) was 68% ofwhite women (Meicher et at.). Whte acute health problems were predominant at the beginning of the century. chronic conditionsare now the more prealent health problem lor the elderly. The likelihood of suffering ihm a chronic diseaseor disabling conditlon Increases with aeo. Seventy live percent oa strokes occur after age 65. Mostamputations occur In elderly persons. The majority oa hip fractures occur In people between the ages of70 to 78 years. Eighty.six percent of the elderly population over 65 develop at least one chronic conditionan d 52 percent of those over 75 have some lmitations in the conduct 0o their daily activies (Kemp ea at..198t). In 1966, the leading chronic condnions among the elderly were arthritis. hypertensien, heaingimpairments ard heart disease. The liketihood of suffering from arthritis In 68% higher or those 65 and olderthan for those 45 to 64. In 1985, approximately 5.2 m 1ilon Americans 65 or older were mtdly-to-severely disabled ard needed assistance ard special aids to maintain their independence. This fgure Is expected to reach 7.3inbise by the year 2000. Dabuilty ln the elderly Is commonly measured accoiding to the degree ol difficultyexperienced In performing activies of dualy living (AOL). Le. personal care ard home management. About25% of the parsons 65 and alider fiing In the community (95% of all the 65 plus poputationj have diffcdltywith one or mare of the seven personal care activities Inventoried (bathing, dressing, eating. geting In ardeel of bed/choirs. wathing. going outslde, using the toeta) About the same proportion experienced difcuitywith at least one at the sin home management ac~tites (preparing meals, shopping tar personal items.managing money, using the telephone, doing heavy housework. doing light houseworh). This proyponoincreased with age, rising tram 15%, tar those agnes 65-6Uo 49% tar those 65 and over (Melcher et at,. tee87 1963).76 These demographic data cannot but resua In a growing demand for specialized health care for the elderly. However, despite this growing demand for geriatricians. the field has ddificutty attracting physicians because of the Inequities of the Medicare reimbursement system and because providing general care to an elderly patient is deemed less prestigious than other specialties such as cardiology (Monithan, 1988). Another particularity of the fuidd of geriatrics is that It requires a team of health providers. inciuding music therapists, who work together to take care of cider people in a iarger amay of settings, not only in the hospital but in the home (Monahan). Perhaps the most eloquent proof of concerned Interests In this topic are two articles that appeared in the New York Times Health section. The frst voiced some relief: 'Finalty. doctors ask if bretal tails need be a tad of Ids in the elderly' (Thursday 12/29/19tf. p. B9). Alter exposing some hard iacts and reviewing the state-ol-the-art. it is ciearly stated that, although engaged, the struggle Is not over yet and a great deal remains to be done. The other aside published excerpts of a report written by the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human and Services iDHHS). related to the wide medication misuse In the elderly.' He found that 5tr% of deaths Irom drug reactions occur In people age 80 and cider, even though they account for only 17% of the population. Misdiagnoses by doctors and faulty prescribing were incriminated and primarily attributed to Inadequate medical training and education in geriatrics (Wednesday 2/13/1989. pp. Al. A17). Perhaps the most concerning problem in the elderly is drug Intake, s a stand alone or because of Its relationship to falls. It has been carted 'the nation's other drug problem.' Waliamson (1 978) noted that 87% of those individuals over 75 years old living in the community were on medication, with 34% taking 3 or 4 different drugs. Hamdy et al. (1977) found that two thirds of apparently lit old people living at home had at least one illness. On average, each hospitalized elderly patient has six diseases. Multiple pathology leads to potyphamiacy, which seems to be the rule in this population. In 1987, nearly three times as many prescriptions were given to American patients over 80 (I1.4 per person) as were given to those under 85 (4 0 per person) (Task Force on Prescription Drugs. 19t8). In 1977. 39% of prescriptions for hypnotics were for patients us-plus, and over hail the prescriptions for barbiturates were for this age group. Another very imporlant aspect of the geriatric populations needs is housing. Although It becomes increasingly ditffcult with advancing age, the vast majority of cider people (84 percent) wish to remain in their present home with lamtiar surroundings, never having to leave It (AARP survey, 19 90). The New York State office on the aging has determined that, in recent years, advancements In technological and architectural design features have made I possible to design housing that we accommodate the gradually changing needs that many Individuals experience during the normal aging process. Adaptive technology, Incorporated unobtrusively Into housing units, can maintain a continuing balance for cider residents. Recent advances in technology have led to the teasibility of designing low cost systems that can aid cider chizens In accomplishing daly IMog activties. Several studies have recently Investigated new technologies to assist elderly and disabded Individuals in the home setting (Potman 1980: Prosper, 1990; Trimble, 1989). Increasing attention Is being paid to personal computer based systems that will allow unrestricted access to essential services previously beyond the reach of Indivduals whose moblity has signiticantly deteriorated with age. Since 1984, both Industry and government (through the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitatian Services [OSERS) and the National Institute on Disability and Rehabtiitatlon Research [NIDRRj) have supported the provision of computer services to senior citizens and the disabled. Vanderheiden et al. (1989a) have studied various methods of increasing the accessibility of computers and informalion services to persons with disabtilies. A second phase of this study, conducted by Borden (1988). focused on disseminating current Information about avatabe products. Other novel projects are underway to promote the standardization of the connections between user-Interiace devices and the electronic-assist devices used by disabled Individuals (Vanderheiden., 1989b). 2. Needs of Ihe Elderly and Service Providers Older persons have special needs that are a consequence of the aging process. They are laced with functional limitations very simiar to those experienced by people with disabilities acquired through accidents or disease. Medical, neurological, and orthopedic Impairments become increasingly common as the age of the population Increases. Typical conditions resulting In disability include heart disease, hypertension, stroke, arthritis, hip Iractaures. Alzhelmers disease, pulmonary disease, and deficits in hearing and visionr Although rehabilitation technology has been widely used In attempts to alleviate the advemse enects of disabtity and Impairments, 0 has not generally been focused on solving the problems of elderly disabled individuals. Devices and techniques aimed at ameliorating specific diseblities are usually designed to augment or take advantage of residual compensatory abilities. Therefore, trailty and lack of muscle strength In the elderly population compounds the diniculties and renders it even more dinicuit to provide adequate aids to this group of individuals. Moreover, i is interesting to note that older persons expedencing problems In perlorming their activilies of daly living, do not, for the most par, consider themselves to be disabled. Because they do not perceive the serious nature ol their deficits, they rarely accept the need for adaptive devices and, hence, ignore avaitable assistroe technology. For this reason. it Is important that technology now be utrilized specifically with the problems of the elderly in mind. Efforts must be made to remain sensitive to the general negativity of older Individuals to new technological developments and to devise effective ways to Introduce new assistive technology to this population. Different dissemination media and service systems must be used to reach older persons. In a study of BOO elderly Individuals who owned assistive devices, Page et ai. (1980) found that approximately half of them did not use these aids either because they had been inaccuratety prescribed, did not work, were unsafe or broken or because the elderly person considered the disability as a minor incoevenience to be tolerated rather than to be overcome. Another need of the elderly that will be met by the application of computers Is their need for a slower pace of learning and for more repetitions of an activity to strengthen learning. Use of a computer network would allow the elderly to better assimtate desired knowledge by means of repetitive methods of leaming. Mastering computer programs might also serve to ameliorate an age-related socinr phenomenon known as ageism. Chronological age. in and of itself, is ohmen a major lactor Int uencing a senior ctizen's self esteem. Older persons often see themselves as not having a capacity to deal with disability equal to that of a younger person. Additionatly. older Indrivduats are less likely to believe that they will be abie to recover from a disabling condition and are.more likely to believe that they do not have enough time left to adjus (Kemp, 1986).77 Childress (198I) has SuggeSted that the most effective use of technology b In the preventton of theneed for assntiste devices In the frrmt place. Using simple technical aids (auto seat belts. wamkers grab bareand batance ald such as canes) to pravent serlous injuries and the rensutitng disabliles Is the most advantageous use of technology In the maintenanrce of hunctionat Independence. Safety Is an nmportant tactor In deciding upon the goals of rehablitation when working wlth geriatrfcpatlents. For example. the concem o a physical therapist working with an older person with a gaitdisturbance Is often centered on the peaent's safety. However, for the elderty person, It may be better towalk Incorrectly than to nrt walk alta. Decisions based on safety Issues are heavily vatueadenr One of the greatest needs of older persons in to remain Independent. Many od these Indluduats fear the loss odIndependence more than they fear death. They would rather take the rfsk of falling than be placed In anursing home (Kemp et al., 19M). In this regard. the eennsie uoe d medicatlons by the elderly may alsocontribute to problems in maintaining a sale environment. Disability has a major Impact on lide slbisfaction In the elderly (Kemp et al., 19989). For a person tohave lide satlslactbon. there must be sufficient pleasurable eaperlences to outweigh whatever paint u onesmoy occur during the course of daly living. A disabhity Increases the source of paln In tile without acorresponding Increase In pleasure In later lile, a disablity is offen In addition to other painful losses suchas absence of spouse. low vision, decreased hearing and inability to get out and socialize ahin thecommunity. Other major diticulties presented by a disablity Include the lack of control over one's Ide and the loss di a sense of meaning or purpose in life. The topic of tile satisfaction after disabtity In a veryImportant one In the process of rehablitation. Individuals with low satlstaction wit not only lead very unhappy lives but they wdt also suffer from more medical and psychological disonrders and will require morehealth care and social support than others of the same age (Kemp et al., 1989). Sel-esteem bi another personal qualty that iseverely affected by disablity. People who can acceptand appreciate themselves auer a disablity maintain their sell-esteem and are aide to lead happier, moreproductive lives than those who no longer see themselves as valuable members of society. One of themajor problems wth poor self-esteem Is that I tends to lead to self perpetuating, destructive behavior suchas poor salt-care and negative mental attitudes towards their ability to Improve physically or to accomplishpositive achievements. 3. Heefth Problems of the Elderly; Isues In Prevention Fails In a series of 1,040 orohopaedic patients (Munoz et al., 1909f), those between the ages ofr0 and 8b.while comprising only 5 5% of total hospital admisslons. generated 10% oi total hospital costs. Orthopaedicsurgical patients over age 65. while only 34t5% of total hospital admissions, generated 50% of total hospitalcosts. Although mean hospital cost for all patients was S9.345. the mean cost for those 00 and doder was $17.958. Total personal health care expenditures for the elderly were $120 billion in 1984, with a per capotaspending oi S4.200, representing a 13% average annual Increase from 1977. Each year. tis estimated, morethan 200,000 Americans over the age of 65, suffer hip fractures, and 20.o00 to 30.000 of them die ofcomplications. Fewer than 25% of the survivors ever regain their previous mobility. The cost In direct care is $7 billon or more per vear (Pokras. 1954. The most important determinants of fracture risk, i.e. hipfracture, are fals and reduced skeletal resistance. Le. bone loss (Me ton et al.. t9an). Falls are only the most dramatic and quantifiable aspect of a larger problem. This problem extendsbeyond the act of falling to the loss of self-contidence, the fear of Its recurrence. and the Immoblity thisproduces. This larger aspect limits the lives of far more old people than the actual frequency of their falling.Whether directly or Indirectly affected by fats. most old people are aware of the resulting problems. Theinsecurity this produces may be intangible, but It often has a considerable Impact on older peoples livesand may have substantial economic repercussions (MacDonald, 1985). The rate of falls In a nursing home was found to be approxlmately 2 per patient per year (Baker etat. 198S). Gryfe et al. (t977) found an annual ball rate of ff59 per 1000 among an active ambuldtoryinstitutionalized poputabion over 65. As for community-based studies. the reliance on subject recaC fordocumenting falls ohen results In under-reponing of events and misreporting of circumstances, Thisexplains the wide variabtiry In reported falling rates In the literature: from 24% (Campbell et al.. 1981) to 62%(Perry, 1982). Wlth regard to the severity of falls, In a study O0 147 falls In a nursing home. Rodstein (tsa4)found that only 1.4% resulted In major Injury. Among f51 falls In a home for the aged. Ashley et al. (1977)found 17.5% caused major Injury. Fallassociated mortality Is the seventh leading cause of death In persons75 and older (Ochs et al.. 1985). The mortalay nate rises exponeially with age, ranging from 37/1008000In those 75 to 79 years. to 186/1 00.000 In persons 00 years and aider (Pokras. 9a4). In females, betweenage periods 65 to 74 and 75 to a4, the death rate from talls increases fivefold, whle the Injury rate only Increases twofold. The ratio of fall deaths to injuries more than doubles (Saker et al., 19S). There Is a plethora of factors that may lead to falls and may also contrbute to related lunctionaldeficits such as slow gall and inabtity to climb stairs, Falls are only the tip of an iceberg that encompassesthese less-dramatc but widespread problems. Ahthough some gall alterations In the eldedy are controversIal, e.g. Inability (Hurwitz. 19t8) versusabuIly (Potvin et al., 1980) to walk tandem, there seems to be a general consensus on the tolowing clinical characteristics of seneil gall: galt apaia. Imms et al. (1981) reponed thatwalking speed diminishes with age and Is accompanied by diminished stride length, step frequency, and swing/stance phase time. Walking speed is also dependent upon an IndivIdual's habilual level of activity withindependently functioning Individuals walking faster thanmthose who are housebound. Gait of fallers Is even more compromised than the normal elderly, with decreased walking speed, shoner stride length, as well asa variabky In the length of progressive steps (Guimaraes. et al. 1990). The presence of Irregular Interjectedsteps (staggering) seems highiy characteristic. even predictive. of falles (Woldson et at. 1S8).78 Many studies reported an Increase of sway (unsteadiness) as persons age, and retrospectively associated the amount of sway with a history of tailing (Brocklehurst et al. 1982: Inms, et at. 1981; KrSirhe et al., 1984; Overstaii et at.. 1977. 1978). Femie et at. (1982) found an increased sway In talersthat did not correlate with the number of fats. Although sway has been amply correfated with talling. the nature of this relatIonship has not been defined, nor has the relationship of thin static measure of balance to the more dynamic balance required to make the rapid adjustment of the lower eotremities and center of gravity to prevent fails. In healthy individuals in their W0's and 70's. there is a 20% to 40% decrease of isometric strength in all muscles tested. both proximal and distal. There b a 38% decrement of strength from the third through seventh decades, which Is most prominent at higher speeds of contraction. This has been related to atrophy of the fast twitch (Type 11) muscle fiber (Larsson et at., t979). Wolfson et al. (198i) found severely compromised motor function, well out of range of what is seen In normal aging, in speciihc lower extremity muscles of Irdividuals who fail. Ankle muscles had paticularfy poor function (10% anhkla has hern indicated as a prominent cause of injury Abnormalities of proprioception have been noted in ts to 40% Of eidedy patients, depending on the series jKokmen et a.. 1 978; Wolfwn et al., t955). Ouantitalive determination of proprioception al the knee reveals a deterioration with age that might make walking unsafe or Impossible (Skinner et at. 1984). Vibration sense decreases Signilicantlyaher 50 years. primarty In the lower extremities (Steiness 1957), and results In a two- to tenfold decrease In the perceptual threshold (Penet et ai. 1970; Potvln et al. 1980). iiabirowlt (1982) found astereognosis of the sole of the font alter age 60 in 20% of subjects with nomial gan. This proportion raised to 80% In subjects with gait abnormalities. Virtualy all studies agree that the general effect of taking drugs Is to Increase faIl frequency In the eidedy. Prndham et a. (t981) showed that 48% of a large stratitied population sample of individuats over age 85 taking any drug had fallen In the past year. The tigure was only 42% for non-users of drugs. Davis et al. (1981). In a psychkgeriatric outpatient population, found that any drug Increased the Incidence of dizziness or faling. MacDonald (t985) repons that vinually every femoarfracture occurring a night (93%) was In a person taking barbnurates. In 1,622 geriatric outpatients. 85% of patients taking barbiturates were referred for falls or dizziness; whereas only 24% of the referrals were not taking barbiturates. Wi d et at. (1981) noted that 9 of 11 elderdy fallers In the community who had severe postural hypaension, and were prone to faillng, were taking annihypertensive drugs or drugs with a hypotensive action. Mossey (1985) thoroughiy reviewed the literature conceming social and psychologic factors related to fats The presence of acute and/or chronic tiness and functional Impairment ara the most consistent factors observed to be related to fails and serinus fall-related injuries. Prudham et at.'s (1981) study of self- falls in community-dwelling residents reported 9% of the fallers to have a major problem with cognitve function as compared to 8 t% of the nontoallers. Environmental factors play a large role in the occurrence of fails. Tidelksaur (1990) found the majority of the talls occur in the bedroom and kitchen and on the staikway. He concludes that 72% of the participants in the study experienced a decrease in the number of falls after the environmental changes were Introduced Physical ActIity and Exercise In a very recent study on 50 elderiy women. Uchnenstein et at. (1989) concluded that controlled cdinical trials to study the effect of physical therapy and exercise on balance measures in community-dwelling eldedy women are feasibla. The exercise program in this study was designed with the intent of improving balance, flexibilty. and reaction time, It consisted ol a combination of stretching, active and static balance, response exercises and walking. lasting a total of 60 minutes per session. Each subject had 48 sessions. al the rate of 3 sessions per week. The effect of exercise was determined by the sofe measurement Of sway on a force platform. before and after. Exercise efect was found inconsistent due to several lactors, Inluding lack of compliance. tack of statistical power, Ineffective and inadequate duration of the exercise program. etc. Benefits of cardiovascular exercise In old age has also been described (Gorman et at.. 1988). SpIrduso (1975. 1990) found that reaction time In older exercisers was similar to that of younger subjects and signiticanitly laster than the age-matched sedentary men. Thnoyeas (1998) study in occupational therapy documented the relationship of age to reaction time and movement time of a functional self-paced task in healthy adult females. Normative data of the decline in the central nervous systems' capacity to process selt-paced functional task of drinking from a cup in well elderly were obtained. The results indicate that deteriorative effect of aging may not be limited to speeded activities but mwy Include self-paced tasks as well. Titloye has disseminated the results of her study to practicing occupational therapists, occupational therapy students, other health professIonals. and the older aduts who participated In the study Also In the reaim of occupational therapy. mobility requiring balance maneauvers namely riSng from a chair, tuming and prolonged standing were identified as good predktors of recurrent falling (Tinetl et at. 1981; TobS el at., 1981) it has also been indicated that more fails occur when the older patient is distracted by manipudating or holding an object, or performing an activity (Overstall et al., 1977). Stodefaike (1985) reports the differences In motivating an elderly person to exerche stem from the approaches taken when introducing and Implementing the program. He stratifies the approaches Itbo two categores: mechanis5ic and humanistic. He states that although the study of exercise In a science, the leading of exercise In an art. In comparing the approaches to exercIse In the Table below, hI s apparent that the mechanistic approach towards exercise differs greatly from the humanistic. The intrinsic mothetion of the humanistic approach appears to be well suiled for this population.79 COMPARISON OF MECHANISTIC AND HUMANISTIC Is dn Important factor in the marlrenance of heatth M. ar (I987)loured that a raLnple exercise program tor the oder person that Is not stressful and does no harm could yielda good rate of comtplarnce ( 70%). It Is a program aimed at matdng the patier teld better. whether ornot there Is a measurable Improvement In cardiorespiratory function Smith and Gtlgan (1983) repoet thatdisuse accoraxs tor atmost hail of the hunctUIsal decline on persons between 30 arid 70 years of age. Theymalntain that this trend can be changed with a wele-planned physical actirty program. Simple exercise routines Such as lauminrg jogging with the arms) and natural calisthenics(Slmpson, 193ti DeVrles. t97t) can lead (1B86) found that 'Exercise nmaynot add years to peoples lives, but it can add lfe lto their years. (p.91). They also state that the exercisepotential of many elder persons can be assessed and their maxhnal heart rate determined without elaborate Regular physical actIvity and exercise are critIcal lements In adult health promotion. Increasedlevels d physical activity are aesoclated with a reduced Incidence of coronary heart disease (Powel et at..1987), hypertenston (Paafenbarger osteoporotc htactures (Cooper et al. 19d), helps maintain appropriate body weight (Blair at al.,19i), and increases longevity (Paffenbarger et al.. 1986). Analysis of the 1985 National Health Interview Survey supplemental questionnare on healthpromotion and disease prevention found that regultar, appropriate exercise Is uncommon among personsaged greater than or equal to fly years. Oniy 7%-e8k of this age group regularly engage in exercise capableof malntaining or improving cardlorespiratory itlness (CDC, 199). Moreover, about two thirds of personshn this age group are either adcise irregularly or completely oedentary. The remainder exercise regularly butast an intensity too low to improve their cardnirespirstory titness (Caspersen et at.. tdSe). 4. Music Therspy and the Eldri Music therapy is a torm of treatment In which the patient and therapist are involved In an Interactivemusical dialogue that Is designed to help toster the rehaiblitation of the patient (Nondoa and Robbins. 1977).In the music therapy process, music Is the medium and the means ol communication (Nondoft and Robbins.1983). Music therapy has proven to be an effective medium for patients with severe physical problems(Cook 1986); Davis-Roltans and Cunningham 19t7 Nagler and Lee, t197). The literature do music therapyIs rich with sources that have demonstrated this modality to be an effective form of therapy in theating thegeriatric patient (GlIbed 1977). (Giynn 1986). (MiQigasn 1986) (Palmer 1977). (Smith 1986), (Wole 1983).There have been several audies using traditional music therapy techniques that have idtdenced thetormation oi the theoretical framework of this proposed study that Elustrate the efficacy of this treatment(Bonny 1983), (Blaey 19iS). (Staurn 1983). Additionally, in music therapy. Tomaino (1979) noted that one significant aging process in the elderlyI a decrease in the ability to move through space (Phillips 1960). Coordination oi movement Is enhancedthrough the use of music. In particular. hythm acts as an external organizer to stimulate synchronousmovement pattems (Tonraino 1979). Straum (1983) 'ound that the application rhythmic auditory sthrmiuas a superimposed structure In faclitating proproceptive control of rhythmic gait was moat effective inpatients with herniparesis secondary to stroke, spastic disorders, arid pabift arthritic or scdistic corditioo.Frequently, elderly persons must be involved in extensive exercises to maintain and/or re-estabish optimralmovement Such exercises can be both tedious and painftul resulting in the withdrawai af many elderly fromsuch routinest Music can be used to distract their atention and to raise their threshold to pain therebymakang repetitive movements more meaningful and acceptable (Bright 1972). New research in the ield ofpsychoneurdirnmunrlogy suggests that the production at morphine-fike peptides or endorphins. likely toincrease pain tolerance, may be connected to certain musical experiences (Bonny 1986). The use Of technology to meet the nseeds of patients in the music therapy process Is a new andemerging trend in this fald (iroul (I9ii7). ard irout arnd Mason (1996) have alt used thin technology as an adjunctive, nonprocess-based demertst d the music therapy Sessios The use ad oomptDTer music tedinaogy In the music therapy sessIon as a tool for clinical use hasbeen reported by Nagler (1986) and then Nagler and Lee (1989), Salmon and Newmark (1996) and Spitzer80 (1989). All of these studies achieved diverse and, at times, contradictory resuits One common poin n that they oil eSprss is the use of computer music technology to either teach music or effect a therapeutic change In music therapy session moth. Bloelectrical controllers have bees employed In thn music therapy process, allowing the body to create sound without the ase of traditional Instruments (Knapp and Listed. t990) (Nagler. l990). Controllers of this fashion will be of Importance to this project Is creatlog new data entry methods tor the users of this network. Recently, cliniciass have developed techniques and inssraments that hove allowed therapists new data for use In the manner they approach their patients )Davis-Roilans and Cunningham, 1997; Gregory and Sims. 1987). Preliminary studies have shown that the incorporation of music life review techniques (Vanderark Newman and Bell. 1983) con prove beneficial In aiding the patient In resolution of many psychosicial Issues (Bennec and Mans. 1988; Technotogicaf for the Elderin Disabled Computers can provide new opportanifies for many peopln (Scripp, Meyuard. Davidson. 1988). Current computer technology can provide an effactive moans of delivering health rare towards rehabtitation for the geriatric patient (Furlong and Knarsey. 1980). Yet, the scope of the services that technology can provide is hampered by the effectiveness of this modality because of tto mitigating factors The 0irut factor is the inappropriateness of many technological devices in regurd to this populations unique needs (Grenetield, 1905; McDonald and Sctvaneveidt 1988). This, coupled with the lack of faratiarlty of many older people with technology, ran render even well-designed devices useless (Laurel. I9r me Moaos, 1983). The second factor associated with the ineffective asn of technology for this poputation Is the ditfcult foaming carve that Is present for the geriatric person when attentting 10 assimilate this technology Into their doily routines (Mccuire, 190)6 Many older poople who suffer fron disabilities have several distinct and unique problems (Williams 198 Rahenield, 1986). The condoions that can lead to these factocr ran be summarized as follows: Slower Integration of Information and d s imuli. Ohen, an elderly person will require more repetition of the information that is presented A negative outlook on life often accompanying an aging person. Self-ageism is pervasive, for the elderly view their capacity and skills as a diminishing commodity. As an elderly person becomes engrossed in this negativity, often times their sell-image is deeply affected. * Lie satisfaction diminishes along with social interaction causing isolation and withdrawal to permeate m any areas of their daly existence. A lack of patient interest and motivation in following the prescribed rehabilitation program. A lack of appropriate tools to stimulate a patient into becoming an active participant in his/her rehabituaton. * The Inabtity to provide adequate data for clinical analysis of the patients rehabilitation process. A rather common task could take on a new dimension when atempted by a person of advanced years. Diminished capacity, visual and hearing impediments, as well as reduced cognitive abilities can render even the simplest of technologies useless AI of these factors can play a significant role In some people's lack of ability to operate and maintain tully functional lives with a degree of happiness and a sense of self worth. The use of video games and other related activities can lead to an increased level of self esteem and an enjoyable learning experience (Weisman. 1983) Senior cizens with disabiities are In a need of technology which will Improve their lives while helping to negate the factors described earlier. Technology that will enjoy successful Interaction with elderly people wil need to be devoid of a sharp learning curve (Nagler and iee 1989). The technology must alow the user Immediate and total control of the device and still remain stimulating and powerful enough to engage them on a continuing basis. Childress (1986) addressed the need for the development of appropriate technologies for the elderly. Yet, he does not define the need for applications that computer technology can render beneficial. He does stipulate, however, that the devices that are presently available to the elderly ran be beneficial provided that they are not too complicated (p. 307). Yet, D technology were to be used in a manner that is appropriate to the needs of the elderly disabled person. there would be a muatiplicity of rewards. These rewards would not only benefil the elderly person, but society at large. Studies have demonstrated that, as society ages. a larger and more disproportionate burden Is placed on society to support this distinct group. One study has found that the problem of mobtity In the aging has produced a cost to this country of two bhilion dollars a year In medical care for hip fractures alone (Williams, 1900). It appropriate rare and intervention could be utilized to impel the frail and falling aged person into a state of increased mobility, this cost would diminish. Technology can play a signiircant role in assisting this cause. A person s range of motion, functional exerise capacity and cardiovascular fitness can be Improved with simple and Interesting activaies that can be programmed accordingly. The use of creative, novel and stimulating devices will engage rehablitation patients in purposeful activites that reduce the length of recovery An example of a special product to be used by the elderly is a collection of compact disks ol music relevant to the patients life experiences. All of this music can be interactively controlled winh user responses to a series of activities designed to improve several areas of the patinet's functioning. These areas Incude the patients range of motion, cardiovascular fitness, and cognitive skils. This technology Is unique because os fs abolty to precisely monitor unrefined motion with precision In a cost-effactive manner. Rudimentary examples of this technology are available in popular electronic games. This menu Item wmll use two technologies to create data input. They are motionnsensitive pads and motion-seesitive fields.81 The introduction of computer music technology to the music therapy process is an excitingapplication of using computers in the therapeutic process. What atirs glance may seem like an unnaturalpairing of therapy arid science is actualy a quite complementary and compefling means of reaching apatient in the therapeutic process. A common perception of thin application of technology is that it can betechnocratic anrid devoid of the warmth' at traditioal instrumens. it I the author's experience that this isnot a true or valid perception. As wii be demenstrated later in case studies. a wry satisfactory andhumanistic experience can be achieved creating music with computer music technology. The use of computer music technology In the music therapy process arose out oa several needs thatwere lacing dinicians at the time of the method's Irception. First and toremost was the need to with maximuam opportunity timitatlans of ahandicappIng condilion or a back oa musical ability. Just as an abae-bodied' person can create musichreely and expressivly by striking a drum so ton should a person with diminished physical capacities oran indaility to express him/herself In a conventional manner be abde to convey his/her musical imensionsthrough interactions on an instrument. Cinical uses of thin technology range hrom motion analysis to creating data gloves. weighted datagloves. and weights with attached sensors diowing the creation oa data. A data glove In a device thatcontains this technology and Is aide to create data without the constraints of the thvodimenslonal fieldhoused in the plastic box. By attaching weights to the glove. or sansors to the actuat weights. dinical datais created. B. NEW YORK UNIVERSITY'S COMMITMENT TO MUSIC THERAPY AND THE ELDERLY New York University has maintained a strong commitment to music therapy tor ever three decades.New York University's manic therapy program Is part of the School of Educatlox Health, Nursing arid AnsProfessions. The program maintains a competency-based curriculum in the Master's and Doctorat levesas mandated by the American Association for Music Therapy. Students In this program complete a comprehensive course of study which Is dlinically based.Students ere trained In the theories. methods and practices of music therapy This training includes a broadspectrum ot ciassroom experience. ieldwork and participation In group music therapy that Is designed todevelop a sense of the elements Involved In music therapy practice. The development ol musk silis anddinical Improvisatlon are fundamental components of this curricuia. Betore completion oa their course ofstudies, students must complete a one-year internship in a clinical sesing to develop and master their skills. One aspect oa this program is the Nordoff and Robbins Music Therapy Olinic. This dinic Is underthe direction ot Cdie Robbins. It serves as an advanced training center tor ciniclans to develop their skillsas music therapists working with profoundly handicapped and autistic children. Another aspect of this program Is the close a liance that exists between the music therapy programand the New York University Medical Center. The Medical Center serves as a setting for cinical Intemships.The Howand A. Rusk Institute of Rehablitation Medicine has served as the interaship site for many musictherapy students and continues to sponsor and cdolaborate In some oa the most advanced research beingundertaken in the ield to date. The Howarad A Rush institute af Refhatilitaton Medicine The Howard A. Rusk Institute ol Rehablitation Medicine. an Integral component ot New YorkUniversity Medical Center. Is the worlds first facility devoted entirely to rehabilitation medicine. Foundedin t9i48 by Howard A. Ruskh MD, considered the lather ot rehablitation medicine. the Rusk Institute l thewortd's largest uniersityafiifalaed center oi its kind and has maintalned its preeminent position as a superbfaciity for the rehabilitation and training ot adults and children with disabliities. tor research Into the causesand treatment oa a wide range of disablilies, and for the education of rehablitation professionals. Accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities and the Joint Commissionon Accreditation of Healthcare Organkzations. the Rusk Institute has served as the model for rehabilitationcenters throughout the country and the wodrid. In addition to setting the standard In rehablitation medicine, the Rusk Institute has numerous patientcare Innovations to its credit. Including. * one of the fnis comprehensive programs for the rehabilitation oi patients tollowing spinal cordInjury and head trauma: the development oa technical aids for a variety oa disablities;* advanced application of biofeedback and video games to retrain the muscles of stroke patients:a preschool for inpatients and outpatient Isants and toddlers with disabilities: the Enid A Haupt Glass Garden, in which the lirst hospital-based horicntutural therapy Ishoused;* education for the disabded driver with spacially-equlpped cars. and Independent Uving Experience, housed in a spedcalty-equlpped apartment in preparation fordischarge to the community. Patients hrom around the world are refenred to the Rusk Institute. More than tags inpatients stayat its t52-bed facility annuadty. and more than 8.flty outpattents a year account for over 65.000 outpatientvhts. Patients are treated tor a toll range of disabilities. including stroke, aphasia. amputation chronic painhead and spinat cord injuries. pulmonarydiseases. neuromuscufar diseases. cerebral palsy, spinahbeib andscollasis. Treatment Is organized around a comprehensive Interdisciplinary team approach. with attendingphyslabtst as the tear leader. and including specialis in physical therapy, occupational therapy nursingspeech pathology, psychology. socWl work, vocatlonal rehabilitatlon and therapeutic recreation, as wedi asclinical speclalists from other divisions of NYU Medical Center. Individuaty-structured programs aredesigned to meet the daly needs of patients duriag the hospital stay and astar discharge. encouraging lamilymembers involement In all phases ot treatment (see Appendix t).82 Ceurent Research Gratms and Prqfects Some of the more recent projects Inchude exsporations Into the psychodynamic elements of the music therapy process and research Into the use of cornputer-music systems with physlcaily-disabled patients. One of the more notable projects Involves the work of Dr. Rodolfo L Ulnas. Dr. Ulnas is exploring the use of non-Invasive functional brain imaging to explore the center In the brain related to music-raking and cognition. Dr. Fadi Bejani and Joseph Nagler have recently submitted two major research grant proposals: 'Technology for Older Persons with Disabtiities (Department of Education. NIDRR) and 'National Eidercare Institute on Health Promotion (DHHS-AOA). Both grants greatiy emphasize the use of music and computer technology In a modular software network (Eldemet), aiming to promote Independence In the elderly population, prevent the occurrence of falls, and maintain physical and mental fitness. Or, Mathew Lees aCommitnent to Music Therapy and tire Elderly Dr. Mathew Lee's Invovement in the field of music therapy has been acknowfedged as both visionary and pioneering. He has been Instrumental In the Introduction of diagnostic medical tools for music therapy clinicians, He has bridged the gap between the medical and music therapy communities of deicians (see Appends 2). He has done so by using computer-music tools in collaborative medical/music therapy research that are now used for assessment and treatment In music therapy. In a collaborative endeavor with the Center for Electronic Music. Dr. Lee established the first center for the use of computer-music systems In the music therapy pracess at Goldwater Memorial Hospital In New York Chy. Dr. Lee has been pivotal In the Introduction at both biofeedback and thermography techniques that now show great promise for the next generatIn of research (see Appendti 3). One such device is capable of usIng the body's bloelectlcal energy to produce reat-time sound via MIDI computer-musical-lnstrument control. As founding member of Musk Education for the Handicapped, he has collaborated to sponsor three precedent-sening con ierences spanning a ten-year period (see Appendix 4 AB). His first, a world conaress held in 1Bst -Music Therapy and the Physically Disabled -is fil actively cited In the research eraoture to date. The second, held In 1985 -The Fourth Intewational Conference on Music, Rehabilitation and Human Well-Being -has been cited as a majom contribution to the field. Extensive presentatias and panel discussions focused on the use of music therapy. Special attention was focused upon the needs of the elderly at this conrerence. The late Dr. Howard A. Rusk cited the conference and the proceedings books that emerged from the conference as an Important contribution to a neglected area of medical care. He stated: 'To rehabilitation medicine ft adds a new and vibrant dimension: and to patients. a holistic approach to care.' (Rusk, 1989) (See Appendti 5.) The third conference which was hosted by Dr. Lee In tfi9 -Current Research in Music Therapy -focused on the state of the aer of research In music therapy. Again, special presentations were focused on the needs of the elderly and the cunent state of treatment and reseamch in music therapy. Currently, Dr. Lee serves as senior vice president of MedArt USA a non-prolit organization founded to bring the arts to medicine and medicine to the ans' (see Appends 4,C), and Is preparing for MedArt Intemational's First World Congress on Arts and Medicine, to be held in New Yank Coy February 29-March 1, 1992. At this congress, many of the courses, workshops and free papers specifically report on the use of music therapy and the elderly. As an author and an editor, Dr. Lee has written extensively on the subjects of rehabllitation, geriatric medical care. functionality, music therapy, technology and chronic pain. His entensive bibliography displays a broad range of Insight and expenise on many of today's most pressing health needs for the elderly. C. CUNICAL EXPERIENCE AND FUTURE GOALS By Integrating must and music therapy with the environment of the elderly, many limitations on functional hrdependence may well be removed. Specifically, through the intervention of music therapy. reduced use of medications without consequent diminished function may well resuit, thereby enhancing safety. attention. moblitty and independence. Oeaury. music therapy In its various forms can facilitate cost containment and cost effectheness In the health care of the eldef y at home or in instiutiond. Some of the specific areas of application are described as follows: Extensive clinical case studies show the Intricate nature of the causes of falls In the elderly. Uterature mentlosm loss of balance, loss or proprioception, weakness is the ankle muscles, peripheral nerve damage, multiple drug Intake, decreased attention span, and many other causes. Often, the causes are multiple. Music addresses In essence all or most of these causes, ether through rhythmic cues, or through Increased proprioception, or through enhanced anention span. Remadiable gains were made In many patients presenting with gait disturbances due to one or more of these causes with the use of music and audiovIsual biofeedback Fatls leading very commonly to hip fractures, and hip fractures being the beginning of the end for most elderly, Including lengthy stays in nursing homes, 0 It can at all contribute to decreasing their Incidence. mustn would certainly demonstrate tis cost effectiveness in health care. The price to pay would be minimal. The ultimate goal is always to keep these patients functaoning as Independently as possible and out of any health caoe Institution.83 2.

Chronic Neurologicel Conditions Thin encompasses a great number of rehabhitatlon patients Diagnoses such as stroke, mustipiesclerosis. and Parkinson's disease are very common in a rehabtilation medicine unit, Here again, musicand recreation therapy have been found to be exceilent adjuncts to the more conventional occupational andphysical therapies. These patients ohen are afflicted with several deficils. speech, upper- and lowerextremity motion, attention span. etc. Musical interventions have been found to faciihate the therapeuticprocess In al or most of these deticits, For exampie, ohen times, a stroke patient with upper-extremitydelicit an d slight aphasia has been motivated by music to clap his/her hands and sing along In a musictherapy session, thus enhancing and speeding the recovery process (Appendix 6). S. Relem Dieases Acute or chronic, these diseases are often latal In the elderly population.

RECOMMENDED RESEARCH Although anecdotal clinical experience and a limited number of research studies with the elderly atZconfirm the beneits ot music therapy in preventing potentially fatau condtions. enhancing patieants' weii-being, shortening their hospital stay and Increasing their independence Ihereafter. many longitudinal double-blind controlled studies are now necessary to produce scientific evidence on the effectiveness of musictherapy In the health care delivery system This task In nowadays greatly enhanced by the avalablty dfobjective measurement tools, as previously outlined In this text. It s our opinion that a signilicant effort should be mode at the level ol the federal government toencourage research in thin area As America becomes greyer. thin research witi affect an ever-groming number of ha citizens. In these days of economic hardship and escalating health care costs, the search foraltemetive non-Invasive and less costly therapies should be a necessary locus o0 legislators. RFPs based on the priority area of 'therapeutic effects of music and the creative arts therapies' arelong overdue. Sufficient evidence has been gathered through ptot- and case studIes to warrant such a step.More than 1'i music therapists natinwnide have obtained a Ph.D. degree and are tully trained In schoairdyand academic research, and should be encouraged to pursue a career In thin feed. Upon publication of thefIrst such RFP In the Federal Register, no doubt a brge number of compethive research grant proposals willbe submitted, thus corroborating the above. For exampie. the flowoing could be used as models:84 Demonstration projects expand music therapy services to facilties offering services to older adults, their tamilies and their communities For example, innovative programs tor persons diagnosed with A zheimer s disease and their caregivers can evaluate new techniques In the community. Basic research may document specific processes involving the inOuence ol must on behavior. For example. research on the neurological and physical effects of music involve the use of state-of-the-art technology. .Clinical outcome research provides much needed cvaluation of treatment effects. For example. research on the effect o1 music therapy on patients length of hospital stay or need for medication has Implications for health care costs. e.g. Medicare. Planning shoudd be undertaken towards the establishment oa a Center for Music in Medicine, as pan of the National Insthute on Aging or the National Institute of Child Health and Development, with hs own separate funding appropriation. The staff of the Rusk Institute would be honored to sare as part of the planning committee. E. CONCLUSIONS In our society, the elderly are often viewed as declining In function and ability and as having limited potential to leam, Improve and develop new skills. Such attitudes serve to set minimal levels of aspiration tor our elderly population and the ovewhelming evidence cdeadly Indicates that this view Is wrong, unfair and cQntrary to the facts. Music and music therapy enhance the functional capabnities of lhe elderly as well as raise their level of aspiration and potential to more realistic levels. They can leam, function, enjoy and maintain an independent quality of life U given the tools, environment, support and resources.

I wish to also thank you for the opportunity to participate in today's hearing, which I think has probably already proven to be a landmark occasion in the history of this Committee. I am honored to do what I can to advance the result. To begin, I would like to share with you several conclusions drawn from more than a decade of involvement in the issue that you are addressing here today. All humans are innately musical. By this I mean we are biologi- cally endowed with the ability to create and respond to music. This aptitude is as deeply routed in the nervous system and as integral to life as is the gift of language. Neither age nor physical disadvantage is a bar to active partici- pation in music or to sharing in its diverse and substantial bene- fits. Musical achievement-what we do with our musical birthright- has far more to do with training and experience than with what is called \"talent.\" The process can be started at any age, and requires little more than an eager student and a sympathetic, skillful teach- er. It is never too late to learn. Music has great potential in both medical and rehabilitation treatment protocols. It is largely ignored as a subject for medical research, and it is significantly under-utilized in medical practice. As a neurologist, I am intrigued at the multiplicity of musical forms and its remarkable influence on human development and maturation. I suspect that something like the following is true- music arises spontaneously from a brain whose operations are in- herently rhythmic, harmonic, patterned, and sequential. Perhaps this is why it is both a stimulus and a powerful organizer of move- ment, thought, language, emotion, personal action, and social inter- action, and why it retains this power throughout life. If I may, I would like now to describe briefly the path that led me to these conclusions. I am a neurologist, and I began full-time practice with the Per- manente Medical Group of Northern California 23 years ago. My own development as a physician has been deeply influenced by many colleagues and a professional situation emphasizing high- quality health care that is both humanitarian and economical. It is fundamental to our philosophy that a patient become an informed, active partner through education, and the fostering of personal at- titudes and strategies which promote health and well-being. To me, education for life and education for health mean the same thing. It was not obvious to me until just a few years ago that adding education for music would give us a third component in this strate- gy for a fuller and healthier life. I owe it to my own piano teacher, Lillian Bauer Cox, that I discovered I didn't have to spend the rest of my life standing outside the window looking in at the musicians.89 Lillian, who was my daughter's piano teacher, had asked me togive a talk on the brain to her students. \"They'd love to know howthe brain makes the fingers go\" is how she put it. I gave the talk,and Lillian rewarded me with three free piano lessons. \"Whoknows?\" she said, \"You might enjoy it.\" She was right. For 5 yearsI studied piano with her, having so much fun I could not under-stand why more people my age didn't study music. I decided theanswer had more to do with the way people were taught than withany innate incapacity to learn. So I decided to write a book about my experience. The book,called \"Tone Deaf and All Thumbs,\" was intended to refute thewidely held belief that music belongs to specially gifted people whodemonstrate their precocity at the age of 3 and are put on the Juil-hard admission list when they are 5 or 6. The book brought mequite a few interesting letters from other adult beginners, most ofwhom said they owed their success to a teacher who didn't knowthe meaning of the term nonmusician. The research I did for the book had another consequence. Ibecame interested in finding other health professionals, scientists,and educators who might have something to say about the physicalside of music making. In 1983, I met Professor Franz Roehmann atthe University of Colorado in Denver, who is here with us today.He offered to help organize a conference in Denver called \"The Bi-ology of Music Making,\" which was held in 1984. This was so suc-cessful that we decided to do a second, \"Music and Child Develop-ment,\" held again in Denver in the summer of 1987. And just 2weeks ago we held our third conference-\"Music, Growth, andAging\"-at the University of Rochester. We have published booksbased on the two conferences I described, and are now working onthe manuscript for the third. One of the important outcomes of the Biology of Music MakingConferences has been the clarification of an agenda for building onwhat has already been learned. I am submitting to you today, as anexample of such a proposal, a proposal for a Music DevelopmentResearch Institute, which we prepared last year as part of a long-range development plan involving a number of interested institu-tions. In conclusion, I would like to tell you about my hopes for thefuture. We have much to learn about music in human life. Weneed better ways to bring artists, scientists, medical practitioners,and educators together more effectively. I cannot say enough to praise the commitment to interdiscipli-nary research and education which exists at the University ofRochester, where the Eastman School of Music and the School ofMedicine and Dentistry have formally established programs tosponsor new work and to foster new careers linking music with bio-logic, behavior, and medical science, and where studies on agingand health already represent a high research priority. Similar ef-forts are being discussed and planned at the University of Coloradoin Denver, the University of California in San Francisco, and otheruniversities. But these remain fledgling programs, and they de-serve far greater recognition and support than is presently avail-able.90 What you are doing here today could be an important first step in creating a national initiative for musical opportunity for our entire population. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Dr. Wilson follows:]91 Special Committee on Aging United States Senate August 1, 1991 Statement of Frank R. Wilson, MD.

L The Proposal The Biology of Music Making, Inc, in cooperation with university affiliates, and anticipating the emergence of a new scientific discipline, will establish the Musical Development Research Institute. Its mission will be to: * Carry out basic research in biomechanical, motor and perceptual correlates of musical performance* Offer research and technical training to industrial and design engineers, clinicians, music educators and other professionals and graduate students in preparation for career work in performing arts medicine, musical instrument ergonomics, and basic research in human musical skills* Publish research, conduct symposia and workshops, and engage in public information activities * Consult with private industry and with clinical entities concerning health problems of musicians and others whose work involves skilled use of the hands * Reeruit a staff of research professionals and consultants, emphasizing the collaboration of bioengineers, neurobiologists, psychophysicists and movement and behavioral scientists * Create a self-supporting, state-of-the-art research facility IL Organizational background The Biology of Music Making, Inc. is a nonprofit tax exempt educational organization incorporated in Colorado in 1984. The Board of Directors consists of: President Franz L Roehmann, Ph.D., Professor of Music, University of Colorado, Denver Vce Prddent Frank R. Wilson, MD., Associate Clinical Professor of Neurology, and Director of Education/Research, Health Program for Performing Artists, University of California, San Francisco Secretary-Treasurer Patricia L Wilson Consultants to the Biology of Music Making are: Physiolosy George Moore, Ph.D., formerly Professor of Biomedical Engineering. University of Southern California Bimnhnmanics Dr. med. Christoph Wagner, Professor of Physiology of Music, Hochschule far Musik und Theater, Hannover, Germany Computers Bob L. Berschauer, President Microlusiness Instruction PubLuations Norman Goldberg, President, MMB Mus Inc. St. Louis The Biology of Music Making has conducted two international conferences at the University of Colorado, and held its third conference at the University of Rochester in July, 1991. Proceedings from the first two conferences (The Bioogy of Music Making 1987; Music and Child Deuveopnent, 1990) are published. Total grants in excess of $150,000 have been received for conference and publishing projects to date; major contributors include: * National Association of Music Merchants * Yamaha Music Corporation, USA * BM Fund for Community Services * Apple Computers * Baldwin Piano & Organ Company * Kaiser Family Foundation * University of Colorado, Denver * Denver Center for the Performing Arts92 IMl Proposal background Through our conferences and through resulting contacts with clinicians, scientists and educators in the United States and abroad, we have become increasingly aware of the limitations faced by those attempting to conduct basic research into the biological basis of musical performance. Such efforts are hampered not only by financial restrictions but by deficiencies in the scientific skills and protocols demanded for meaningful research Movement-or motor skiffs-science, for example, is a comparatively new but complex and demanding discipline currently pursued in only a few laboratories in the world, where few musicians have visited or worked. Moreover, almost none of the people working in these laboratories is familiar with the particulars of musical training. During the 1989-1990 academic year, Dr. Wilson served as Guest Professor of Neurology at the University of Dusseldorf in West Germany. His research there involved the study of a severe occupational disorder of musicians cailed focal dystonia. Work was carried out using pianos, a computer and software donated by Yamaha Europa and Yamaha Music Corporation, USA. Professors Wagner and Moore, both consultants to The Biology of Music Making, participated in this project and the findings of the study have been presented at two national conferences (American Academy of Neurology and American College of Occupational Medicine conferences in 1991). A major conclusion is that this disorder stems from the interaction of individual physical characteristics, inappropriate training, and mechanical characteristics of the instruments being played. The implications for music pedagogy and instrument design, manufacture and marketing are substantial. So far as we know, opportunities for research of this kind are rare, and will remain so until a way is found to create an environment where the full potential of research into the physical basis of musical skill can be exploited. It is that goal to which the Directors of the Biology of Music Making, Inc. are now committed. IV. Prospects for strengthening the arts-medicine liaison The Biology of Music Making, Inc. has been an active participant and an influential voice within the growing arts-medidne community. The past decade has seen the formation of special clinics for performing artists within major urban medical centers (New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Houston and San Francisco being the most prominent). The Institute will be a primary source of information and training for those interested in developing research skills. Specifically, individuals undergoing training at the Institute will be qualified to work toward: * Improved understanding of the physiological and biomechanical factors influencing individual performance * Improved understanding of optimal training protocols for development of musical proficiency for all individuals, including the elderly and the disabled* Improved understanding of the musician-instrument interface; optimizing instrumental design with respect to acoustic and biomechanical parameters and individual physical variability Improved objectivity in diagnosis of performance related problems * Improved treatment of performance related injuries; where possible, basing therapies on scientifically validated ergonomic and training principles V. Rationale for additional support. In the seven years of its existence, the Biology of Music Making has established itself as an innovative and powerful catalyst for interdisciplinary research and education involving several medical communities, and professionals in music performance and education. Our ability to carry out this work has depended on computer technology for data management communications and publications. As we expand our efforts, our agenda and our contacts, we will increasingly be involved in education and research design and training at the University leveL93 There can be no question that Institute work will generate heightened interestin MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) technology as a basic researchtool in music perfonnance research, and could easily stimulate commerciallyimportant new technology for the study of all human skilled performance. The Institute would become an authoritative source of information aboutoptimal design of musical instruments, and the adaptation of computer andsynthesizer technology to individual training requirements and goals. Byimproving access to instruments and linking pedagogic strategies to scientificstudies of movement the Institute could make a major contribution to thepopularization of music instrument study. Vt. Endowment goal: $5 million The exact costs of establishment of the Institute can only be roughly estimated.The endowment estimate of $5 million contemplates special building designand scientific instrumentation, full-time administrative, technical and researchstaff, communication, computer, conference, publication and library facilitiesand support for consultant activities. It is known that the costs for establishingthe well known acoustic and voice research facilities in Paris, Stockholm andDenver, were equal to or considerably in excess of this amount. VII. Summary No single profession, industry segment or academic institution has theimmediate potential for embracing or pursuing Institute goals independently.Encouraged as we may be by the success of our efforte and activities to date,we are nevertheless sobered by the magnitude of the effort that would berequired to advance to a higher level of commitment or involvement Not onlyhas no other organization managed to develop an institute of the kind wepropose, no one has even attempted to do so. The proposed MusicalDevelopment Research Institute represents an entirely unique conceptualsolution to the most crucial challenges facing music performance medicine andresearch The Biology of Music Miaking, Inc. (Revised August 1,1991) Franz L. Roehmami, President Frank R Wilson, Vice-President 48-782 0 -92 -494 Senator REID. Thank you, Dr. Wilson. Before I ask questions I want to just mention and extend my ap- preciation for Senator Cohen for participating so thoroughly in today's hearing. For those of you in the audience who don't know- and many of you do-Senator Cohen has a particular interest in the arts. He is a part-time Senator and a full-time author. He truly spends the same time we all do being a Senator, but any spare time he has he is an author. He has a book that is fascinating called \"One-Eyed Kings,\" which I read as a gesture of friendship toward him, and then after I got through the first 3 or 4 pages I did it be- cause that's what I wanted to do. It was exciting. He is a poet. And so anything dealing with the arts is something he has particular interest in. Bill, I appreciate very much your being here today and allowing us to use your expertise. We are going to work together to try to do some of the things that this hearing has brought to our minds. Dr. Clair, I appreciate very much your outlining some of the studies that we could conduct that would be beneficial. You outline those in some detail, and it gives us pinpointed subjects that I'm sure we can spend a few dollars on that would save this Govern- ment, in effect, with Medicare and other programs, a hundredfold of what we would spend on those small programs. I appreciate that direction. All of your written statements will be made a part of the record in their entirety. Your testimony outlines specifically what we, as a Congress, need to do to project out some of this music therapy making people well. Thank you very much for your diligence in that regard. Dr. Lee, do you really think music therapy can save on Federal expenditures? If so, why do you say that? Dr. LEE. The answer is yes. I will give you an example. If one looks at the amount of medication that is given in nursing homes, primarily they would fall into two categories-one, to help a patient sleep; the other, to reduce pain. It is my contention and my clinical observations up to this point in time that if we play music or any form of creative art, we'll reduce the amount of medication that is given. What I would like to do, then, is to translate this money that is saved from the pharmacy department and use it to hire a music therapist. Senator REID. Dr. Lee, is it fair to say, then, that music therapy is totally underutilized-if, in fact, it is utilized at all-by doctors, hospitals, and extended care facilities? Is that true? Dr. LEE. Yes. And I think that this hearing will add light to this dimension. I have told music therapists many times that to break into the medical center or hospital circle is awfully difficult, par- ticularly in our budget crisis now. They are going to say, \"Why should I hire a music therapist when I need a nurse?\" They don t look at cost containment, unfortunately. Senator REID. And that's one of the primary reasons, of course to employ music therapy. By not doing so, we are penny wise and pound foolish. Dr. LEE. Yes, sir.95 Senator REID. Dr. Clair, what you see is so much more meaning-ful than what someone tells you, and we saw what you can do onvideo today. It is magic. Is there any other way to describe whatyou are able to do with music? Dr. CLAIR. Actually, I think through very careful observation andtrying to notice the very slight responses, we have been able to tapresidual skills and abilities that were not evident before. Andthrough our research with looking at what kinds of things elderlypersons can do-particularly those who are demented-we havebeen able to build on that knowledge base. So I'm not sure it is justmagic. Senator REID. As a music therapist with the extensive experiencethat you have, would you tell us in your own words some of theways that music therapy improves the lives of older Americans?Dr. CLAIR. It probably provides quality of life by giving opportu-nities for successful experience, for social interaction, for some ofthose opportunities that have been lost through physical restric-tions, through various other kinds of disabilities, and also throughthe types of contacts that older people lose, even if they are well.For instance, their friends die. They may have to relocate. Theymay often move to the town where their children live. There areall kinds of reasons why they lose the social contact.We have already heard from physicians about the physiologicalresponses that happen, and a lot of those we don't clearly under-stand yet. So I think probably the social, the physical, and the emotionalopportunities to express, to share, to interact with others, to havefeelings of belonging, and to just basically have opportunities forself-expression that may not otherwise be there.Senator REID. One last question. Are there schools that give de-grees in music therapy? Dr. CLAIR. Yes. Senator REID. Tell me about them. Are there many?Dr. CLAIR. I believe there are over 65. The University of Kansashad the first degree program for music therapy in 1946, so it hasbeen there for a very long time. These schools are spread through-out the country. Some of them offer the basic bachelor's degree.But there are several that offer the master's degree, and severalthat offer the doctoral program, Ph.D.Senator REID. Senator Cohen.Senator COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I have been sitting here thinkinghow I can respond in a modest way to an overly generous state-ment made by the Chairman. I think that there are probably threeways. There is the Harvard way, the Yale way, and the Maine way.The Harvard way was typified by A. Lawrence Lowell, who saidthat flattery is like nicotine-not harmful unless deeply inhaled.The Yale way was expressed by Robert Maynard Hutchins, whosaid, upon being introduced one time, \"That was the most thor-oughly researched, the most eloquently delivered, and the mostrichly deserved introduction that I have ever had.\" The Maine waywould simply say, \"Thank you for your generosity. Far more gener-ous than just.\" Music, in a way, is very much like poetry. They are inter-related.Robert Frost said that every poem is a stay against the confusion of96 the world. I think that is particularly true of music, as well. It is a stay against that confusion and the disorder and the sometimes chaotic existence that we all experience. And when we listen to music we hear that harmony, and I think that's what brings us the kind of serenity or peace or spirituality that is often missing in our lives. I also agree with Dr. Wilson that we are -all musical, but it de- pends very much on how it is taught. I was taught at a very young age, and I rebelled against it. I had an instructor who insisted I play classical music, and all I wanted to play was jazz. We didn't get along well at all. I finally ended up dropping the instruction because we used to fight every time. I wanted to play \"Five Foot Two and Eyes of Blue\" and he wanted me to play \"The Blue Danube,\" or something of that nature. So I agree with you that a lot depends on how it is taught. That also ties in to what the witnesses have been saying today-that it is important that we, in using this as therapy, understand how to use it, how to apply it, and what is the best type of music for a given individual. We didn't have time to really look into much of the work that you have done, Dr. Clair, in terms of seeing the dra- matic responses, but I assume for all the therapists-and I assume that most of those who were cheering in the audience a moment ago are engaged in music therapy of one kind or another-would agree that's something that we need to focus on-the special aspect of that kind of training. I assume also, Dr. Wilson, that there may be some difference. You have touched upon music therapy as far as directing it toward children or young people, versus those that are older. Is there a basic difference in that kind of therapy? Dr. WIISON. I would like to respond to your question by enlarg- ing the concept of music therapy. In a recent letter to Mr. Adelstein, Professor Roehman said both music education and music therapy are paths which converge on human wellness and vitality in later life. They, like Watson and Crick's double helix, can be two fundamental strands of a compre- hensive, preventive, therapeutic model which provides pleasurable physical and mental activity, as well as social contact, for many of our senior citizens. This is true for children, as well. I also want to call your attention to a video which was submitted to you which introduces another possibility for the use of music therapy. A patient who had a spinal cord tumor-who was a pa- tient of mine-by all rights should be not only wheelchair bound, but bedridden. She is not only not wheelchair bound and bedrid- den, but rides a bicycle and uses on roller skates. She actually began her own music therapy program at the suggestion of a neur- ophysiologist at the University of California in Los Angeles who told her she really should be doing small, rhythmic exercises for short periods of time. Having been a string bass player before, she said, \"Well, that sounds like music to me.\" She made her own exer- cises up, and despite the fact that her brain is in essence discon- nected from the lower spinal cord, she looks to all practical pur- poses to be completely normal. Now, if that's the case-to respond to your question to Dr. Lee, Senator Reid-in terms of economics, if what we learn from this97 patient could be applied to the enormous population of youngerpeople with spinal cord injuries, the savings through restoration ofsome kind of mobility would be simply incalculable.At our recent conference at the University of Rochester we hadan early report from a music therapist who has taken the plungeinto studying neurophysiology and now works with patients withspinal cord injuries using musical stimulation. So, research hasbegun on this potentially very important use of music therapywhich simply does not respect the question specifically of age.Another point I would like to just add-because this is my ownexperience-concerns the relative newness and unfamiliarity ofmusic therapy in general hospitals. I was responsible for the intro-duction of music therapy into the hospital where I work in Califor-nia simply by inviting a music therapist to participate in the hos-pice program, whose patients who are being cared for for malignan-cies. Interestingly, there was no resistance to her joining the staffbecause she wasn't competing with anyone. The sad story is thatwhen patients have fatal illnesses, the doctors are often out oftown, so to speak. I'm sorry to say that about my profession, butthe fact is that that happens. Music therapists working with hospice patients make a very sig-nificant contribution to patient care. A patient with a malignantbrain tumor, who was my own patient and who was being seen bythe music therapist, had finally withdrawn from all communicationnot only with me, but with his family.The music therapist was able to reach him, to draw him out. Iremember the last interview that I had with him was one in whicha question about whether he should have a second round of chemo-therapy was raised. Instead of simply sitting there as though hewas not a participant, he became very emotional. Even though hehad lost the ability to communicate meaningfully with language,he was able to indicate exactly what it was that he wanted.So he actually was brought back into the family/physician/pa-tient interaction in a very important way.We really haven't begun to scratch the surface. We have notbegun to see really what the basic physiology of music is. I thinkthat I'd like to have a conversation with Mickey Hart about wherethe rhythmic impulse comes from because, in fact, the leading edgeof neurophysiologic research now has to do with the generation ofrhythmic activity in the brain, and it influence on thought, con-sciousness, and movement. I see a very happy future. I think that you gentlemen and ladiesin the Congress and Senate could help a great deal by simply legiti-mizing this effort and the concept.Senator COHEN. Thank you very much, Dr. Wilson.We're nearing the end of the hearing, itself, but I wanted to sayhow helpful this has been. I remember years ago when it came to dealing with the elderlythe solution was simply to put people in nursing homes. At thattime, I recall Senator Percy, who was serving in the Senate at thattime, referred to warehousing the dying. There was very littlebeing done at that time in trying to stimulate the elderly, butrather just to put them where it would be convenient for their rela-98 tives to visit them and to care for them physically, but not enough was being done for the spiritual side or the physical side. There was too much dependency upon drugs to kill the pain in dealing with their particular problems, or to keep them quiet, or whatever. That led to a series of investigations by the Aging Com- mittee, as such, or a Senate committee, as well as the House, and the forming of a House Select Committee on Aging, as well as one in the Senate. I think we have come quite a long way since that time in just dealing not only with physical rehabilitation, but we have come to a different level, or we are coming to a different level now, and that's to see the importance of the mental side, the spiritual side, and the role that not only music, but the entire field of medita- tion-they are doing quite a vast array of experiments now in terms of finding out what role the mind plays in curing disease or helping to cure disease. So we've got a whole new universe of experience that has to be explored yet, and I think this hearing has been particularly help- ful. As you asked, Dr. Wilson, and others have asked: what can we do? We can help give it credibility, but our own credibility rests upon the quality of the people that come before us, and so we thank all of you for coming and being part of the panel here to lend credibility to this inquiry into new and very productive ways of dealing with our elderly. Senator REID. Thank you, Senator Cohen. This concludes the hearing today. It has been a first in many ways. We are going to have another first. I'm going to ask Ken Medema, an experienced performer, as we know, and a music ther- apist, to conclude this hearing with a song summarizing what we have heard. I believe this is the first hearing in U.S. Senate history to conclude with a musical coda. Go ahead and make history. [Musical presentation by Mr. Medema.] Mr. MEDEMA [singing]: I'm growing old and help me stay young. Let the music be played. Let the songs now be sung. Back in Indiana, We never really did know, There were folks like music therapists, round, Such a thing to learn today. I had a stroke. Look at me now. I learned to play the music somehow. Whoever thought we'd see it, In the halls of Congress today, There is music playing and songs being sung, It must be the start of something brand new, So I'm growing old Help me stay Forever Young. [Whereupon, at 1:25 p.m., the committee adjourned, to reconvene at the call of the Chair.]APPENDIX Iten I Testimony ofPinchas Zukerman Before theSpecial Committee United States SenateHearing on'Forever Young: Music and Aging' August 1, 1991 \"I have been intensely involved with music all of my life. In my experience, most music becomes a bonding force to uniteand often to comfort people and lead them to some kind ofemotional healing. It helps provide a way to celebrate, togrieve, to participate in the fundamental thoughts and feelingsthat make us human. It provides a connection throughouthistory. In Tchaikosvky's famous \"1812 Overture, a dramaticexperience is related of living through a war where the Russianswere fending off Napoleon's advancing army. It is an amazingthing that the war itself ended but the experience lives onthrough the music. All sound is an influence of some sort whether it is greatclassical music or the noise on a city street. Human beings.seem to be affected by sound more than anything else. I've readstudies of babies still in the womb reacting to sounds, and ofpeople near death who upon awakening can recount things theyheard while supposedly unconscious. When you know what thebeneficial results of certain sounds are, it is useful to becomeattuned to those sounds. This is what the various music therapyprograms provide -- putting some attention on sounds thatinfluence us in a healing way. I have played in senior citizenscenters and this always seemed to give them an incredible \"up.\"I think somehow it activated an innate vitality that allowedthem a way to be truly engaged in life. If used properly, musicis certainly a powerful therapeutic tool. I personally knowseveral psychotherapists who use music in their work. One ofthem told me she has used my performance of the Beethoven ViolinConcerto in her work with great success. She told me it createda better environment for the patient and also allowed her tobecome a better conduit for a therapeutic experience to occur. So, I would say absolutely that music has an impact on aperson's physical, emotional, and mental functioning. There are countless musicians that have continued theircareers into old age becoming some of the most revered artisticnames of our time -- Arthur Rubinstein, Vladimir Horowitz,Leonard Bernstein, Rudolf Serkin, Claudio Arrau, Pablo Casals,are lust a verv few of these names. The pianist Mieczyslaw Horszowski (pronounced Meesloff Horshofskee) is now well intohis 90's and still touring around the world to the delight ofaudiences of all ages. Remaining an active performer, which Ihope to do for a long time, just makes life better. It is very important for serious consideration to be givento including music therapy in quality care for older people. Ifthis isn't part of such programs, we will see a dwindling awayof older people and the effect will be to lose all theirknowledge from a life of experiences. It is imperative to passthese things on. Older people are like seeds for the young.They plant their knowledge and there is a continuation into thenext generation and the next, which is what builds a greatcivilization. I'm sorry I couldn't be in Washington to speak personallyabout this subject which is so close to my heart. I hope thistestimony will be useful in helping to put attention onsomething so important but which is often sadly neglected, orworse, taken for granted.\" Aging \"Porever and aging\". by Dr. Miohael B. Thaut R3T Associate Professor of Music Therapy Director of Graduate Studiea in Kunio Therapy Director of lusia Neurophysiology Researoh Laboratory Colorado State University Music in Rotor Recovery with Neurological Disorders Our research and clinical observations over the last 3 years clearly show that music can play an eminent role in the motor recovery of neurological disorders, e.g. stroke, parkinsons disease, closed head injuries, etc. Our data show that auditory stimulation can excite and shape activity in the motor system and thus can help to organize, sequence, pace and integrate complex movement. We have to emphasize that the primary clinical importance of music does not lie in its emotional or motivational value to accompany therapy but in its neurological effect to improve motor control. In the following examples we try to outline different angles in which music is efficient as neurological technique to improve motor control. At Colorado State University we have done several studies to look at the effect of rhythm as pacing signal on muscle activity in arm extension/flexion and walking. We have found that when muscle activity is synchronized to auditory rhythm it becomes more regular and efficient. In other words, the timing of muscle activity (as measured by Electromyography) becomes more consistent and predictable. At the same time, duration of certain muscle groups (for example the calf muscle in walking) is shortened. However, during this more precise and shortened period of muscle activity the muscles work with a higher amplitude, i.e., more muscle fibers are activated. These data strongly suggest that rhythmic pacing provides stronger and more focused muscular effort on a neurological level, which translates into improved motor control, e.g., better rhythmivity, during movement. We found these effects with normal individuals and persons with stroke, cerebellar dysfunction, and motor planning disorder. Our findings lead us to believe, that rhythm is an excellent entrainment stimulus to retrain muscular control in individuals with damaged motor systems. Walking re- training to metronome bursts and musical stimulation has been incorporated into therapy protocols with great success into the clinical work we are doing.101 Several other clinical examples underscore how efficient musiccan be to establish and re-train motor control. A 64 year old ladywith massive diffuse brain damage due to a closed head injurysustained in a car accident had shown almost no purposeful fine orgross motor movement. She has had some piano training in heryounger years. After the therapist had done some repatterning ofher fingers on the keyboard she started moving her fingers independently, playing scales with both hands. She adjustedautomatically her slumped posture and nonfunctional arm and wristposition in her wheelchair. She also opened her eyes to track herfingers moving and began to imitate finger patterns modeled by thetherapist. Her display of motor skill and sensory-motor integrationon the keyboard was dramatically out of proportion with her generallevel of functioning. The motor traces laid by her previous musicaltraining were still intact and opened a window to re-trainingpurposeful movement. A 67 year old man who suffered from brain damage due toprolonged loss of oxygen during a heart attack was completelydisoriented to time, place, or person. He did not recognize orremember even the most familiar things. His short term memory wasalso virtually nonexistent. However, when the therapist played thefirst notes of songs he once knew on the keyboard, the patient wasconsistently able to play and sing the songs with no help.Initially, the patient could not name the songs he just had sungnor could he remember his performance even in short term memory.Eventually, this activity became an excellent avenue to train hismemory recall. The same patient walked exceedingly slow and showedno ability to initiate stopping or going on his own, With rhythmicpacing the patient was able to double his walking speed within thesame session. Music on or off was also quickly comprehended as asignal for motor initiation without verbal cueing. The examples above illustrate a striking clinical observationthat musical traces in motor and cognitive memory are oftenpreserved in a very severely damaged brain. This observation leadsus to suggest that the musical modality is a very efficientmodality to learn to perform and control very intricate movementsin a neurologically deeply ingrained manner. Observing the rapidfinger movements of a pianist illustrates this point very well.Would the pianist be able to learn and flawlessly perform the samesequences of finger motions without hearing himself. The likelyanswer is no. Again, therefore, organized sound as peripheralfeedback for movement seems to have a very benefitial effect oncreating motor memory. The efficiency of music as neurological movement organizer inmotor rehabilitation is not limited to accessing healthy motorschemes in patients with previous musical background. Our researchwhich was done with nonmusicians bears that out. We have treatedmany nonmusician patients where the musical/rhythmic organizationof movement, be it through musical pacemaking or through actuallyplaying simple instruments to create your own acoustic feedback,has shown to re-train movement more efficiently than any othermodality. Rhythmic organization of movement has helped to overridetremors in the upper extremities during simple activities asreaching and lifting a cup. We have used musical stimuli as sensorytrigger cues for weightshifting, balance control and motorinitiation with Parkinson's disease patients. Our clinical and resarch evidence shows that music -asextremely efficient modality to train motor control in healthyindividuals -can be applied to re-train damaged motor controlsystems in neurological patients when properly adjusted andexecuted, such as by trained music therapists. Based on the promising results we are seeing we believe thatstrong research efforts in music therapy and in interdisciplinarycooperation with rehabilitation medicine and neurophysiology arein order and fruitful. Applied research should look into therefinement of musical/rhythmic techniques in rehabilitation effortswith different clinical populations. However, we also feel a greatneed for basic neurophysiological research to elucidate theinteraction between peripheral acoustic sensory input and motorneural activity.102 Item 3 STANFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE DMSION OF GERONTOLOGY Older Adult and Family Research and Resource Center Mailing dd Geronologp Reseah Programs (415) 858-3989 Aenue Palo Alto, CA 94304 THE IMPACT OF MUSIC THERAPY ON OLDER AMERICANS EXPERT TESTIMONY by Suzanne B. Hanser, Ed.D., RMT-BC for the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging August 1, 1991 AUTONOMY EFFICACY EMPOWERMENT This is what music therapy offers older Americans! AUTONOMY Music is something which engages people, whether they are healthy and talented or disabled and dependent. While performing in an ensemble or listening to familiar, calming music, individuals are successful and creative, expressing themselves in a positive and unique way. This leads to a sense of independence for the many Americans who have difficulty coping with the problems associated with aging. My recent research, sponsored by the National Institute on Aging, demonstrated that an 8-week music listening program facilitated by a music therapist could help clinically depressed, homebound older adults cope with stress and overcome symptoms of anxiety, depression and physical complaints. Using a controlled experimental design, these older individuals maintained statistically significant improvements on all standardized psychological tests over a nine-month period. This low-cost and easily accessible program holds potential for delaying or minimizing the need for residential care for this more frail population (see Journal of Applied Gerontology). In other experimental research, I found that familiar music helped hospitalized patients relax and distracted them from pain. Coping with pain and anxiety with minimal medication was an outcome of this music therapy program in which patients were shown how to focus on the music, induce deep, rhythmic breathing103 and peaceful imagery.(see Journal of Music Therapy). More effectivecoping may lead to shorter hospital stays, faster recovery, andprevention of placement in skilled nursing facilities. My NIA-sponsored music therapy research indicated thatfamily caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease experiencedrelief from the stress and burden of caregiving whileinvolved in shared musical activities with their impaired loved ones.Because even victims in the latest stages of Alzheimer'sdisease can appreciate and participate actively in musicactivities, all family members are able to focus on more positiveaspects of their loved one's personality and share in an enjoyablecreative time together (see Music and the Healing Process). Thisprogram enabled families to adapt to the difficulties of caregiving athome, potentially delaying institutionalization of the person withAlzheimer's disease. EFFICACY As shown in many studies and clinical cases, music increasesself-esteem. When older Americans engage in music activities, theyderive a sense of self-esteem which affects their attitudes andapproach to life. An enhanced sense of self-efficacy may lead tobetter functioning which, in the long run, improves mental andphysical health. Everyone is capable of creative expression, even thosewho respond to nothing else. Research by Dr. Mary Boyledemonstrates responsiveness to music by comatose patients. Otherscientific evidence by Dr. Alicia Clair, Dr. William Beatty, myself andothers provides documentation of amazing changes in cognitivelyimpaired older Americans, particularly those with Alzheimer's andParkinson's disease, when they are involved in music. EMPOWERMENT What does this research mean? Music therapy empowers people to: *gain control over their moods, their futures, their lives*prevent or delay placement in long-term care facilities*remain independent, content and self-sufficient*identify their abilities and talents rather thanconcentrating on their worries and difficulties * have access to a cost-effective means of treatmentwhich may benefit both physical and mental health104 Iten 4 Statement of John E. Frohnmayer Chairman, National Endowment for the Arts Chairman, National Council on the Arts Hearing before the Special Committee on Aging United States Senate on 'Forever Young: Music and Aging' August 1, 1991 Music knows no age. Vladimir Horowitz played the piano with subtle beauty and skill when he was well over 80. At age 74, Dizzy Gillespie continues to wow audiences with his virtuoso jazz trumpet; and his contemporary, Isaac Stern, recently returned to the stage in Israel to play the violin as a signal for courage during the missile attacks in Tel Aviv. Ella Fitzgerald, 73 years young, continues to captivate audiences with her interpretations of Cole Porter's memorable music. Dozens of composers, conductors, and musicians continue to strive to perfect their art long past the typical retirement age. Audiences, likewise, are not bound by the strictures of age. In concert halls, opera houses, jazz clubs, and other venues, you are likely to find a significant portion of the audience composed of men and women over age 55. Older audiences bring experience, appreciation, and understanding of the rich complexities of music -- what Longfellow calls, the \"universal language of mankind\". For those older Americans who do not have easy access to live musical performances. the Endowment has a number of programs which help bring music to the people. As part of our overall mission, the Endowment encourages greater access to and participation in the arts in the belief that exposure to artistic experiences contributes to the quality of life for all citizens. Through grants awarded to individuals and organizations, as well as its own programming, the Arts Endowment ensures the continued involvement of older adults as creative artists, students, volunteers, audience members, and patrons.105 To that end, the Arts Endowment's Music rrogram guidelines require all performing and presenting organizations to submit statements detailing their outreach efforts to the elderly and other special constituencies, such as the disabled and the underserved. Organizations that document significant activity or progress in this area score higher in the panel review process than those that do not. In addition, a significant number of Fellowship grants are awarded to older composers and performers each year on the basis of artistic excellence. For example, the Jazz Masters Fellowships which recognize significant, life-long achievement in jazz, were awarded this year to Clark Terry, age 71, Buck Clayton, bge 80, Danny Barker, age 82, and Andy Kirk, age 93. Our Music and Opera-Musical Theater Programs provide support to dozens of orchestras and opera companies which provide free or discounted tickets for older and disabled persons around the country. Some companies, such as the Fort Wayne Philharmonic, promote tour ensembles to senior centers, hospitals and parks. Also, OPERA America helps member opera companies make opera more accessible to all through an Endowment grant. In addition, our Folk Arts and Inter-Arts Programs fund a number of musical projects that benefit older Americans. Radio and television programs funded by our Media Arts Program enable millions of older Americans to enjoy the best in all forms of music. Here are some additional examples of the types of projects we support: For the past 14 years, the Visiting Artists program in Davenport has allowed artists in Iowa and Illinois to share their talents with the elderly, with school children, factory workers, and persons with disabilities. These residencies are carried out in nearly 30 school districts and six area colleges as well as dozens of workplace, community center, and health care facilities. Each artist makes two or three appearances daily, and the residencies are a combination of performance and discussion. At the end of the residency, a full public concert is presented free of charge in one of several local theaters. In 1990-91, Visiting Artists will present 276 performances by 24 nationally recognized artists throughout the greater Quad City region, reaching an estimated 80,000 people.106 The Ohio Chamber Orchestra received a $10,000 grant from the Music Program to support expansion of their summer series in Cleveland's Cain Park. This series makes classical music readily accessible to families and people on fixed incomes. Through arrangements with area retirement communities, transportation to and from concerts is provided for senior citizens. The Dallas Symphony received a grant from the Music Program to support their classical subscription series, Super Pops Series, and community services. Under the Heartstrings program, senior citizens and people with physical and economic handicaps are given free season subscriptions. A Folk Arts grant of $15,000 went to the Vermont Folklife Center to support 'The Family Farm,' a radio series of 50 five-minute programs about rural artists and art forms, including poetry, storytelling, songs, musical instruments, and wood and metal working that will reach out to 100,000 people. During the preparation for this series, the fieldworker interviewed over 125 farm households. After the program was broadcast over Vermont Public Radio, it was made available to National Public Radio as well as commercial radio stations. In Omaha. Nebraska, the Metropolitan Arts Council (a 1990 Challenge grantee) is reaching out to everyone; their mission statement reads: '. ..we believe the arts are for all of us; for children and adults, for people of all races and ethnic backgrounds, for people with disabilities, and for people in hospitals and nursing homes.' We share their commitment to all audiences. Attached is a list of other selected projects which reflect the breadth and diversity of these programs for older Americans across the country.107 The arts help us express some of our deepest feelings -- of love, trust, alienation, and hope. Art teaches us to verify our most personal experiences; to listen to intuition along with reason; and to perceive what is beyond the obvious. To develop in each person a sense of worth, of self-esteem through the ability to command self-expression in the arts, is a task which we Americans -- young and old, black and white, rich and poor -- face together as we near the beginning of a new century and a new age.

S. Senate Special Committee on Aging Gail B. Broder, RMT-BC The Westchester House, St. Louis, Missouri My camer as a clinical music therapist working with older adults really began with the lessonsI learned from my own famrily, I grew up surrounded by the wa mth of a large, close-knitextended family which included all four grandparents and eight great aunts and uncles. All of themwere vibrant, energetic, vital people who lived their lives to the fullest They taught me a lessonabout the value of the elderly, for I always saw their contributions to each other, to our family, andto the community. Throughout their lives they loved music -whether listening to the radio,listening to records, playing their instruments, attending concerts, or sitting around the kitchentable with cups of coffee singing the Yiddish melodies of their youth. Music added something totheir lives that enriched them, and, through their example, it enriched me. From these earlyexperiences with my family, I chose to focus my work as a music therapist in the area of olderadults. This testimony will briefly outline my clinical practice of music therapy with thispopulation. Let me begin by citing several case studies from my clinical work at The Westchester HouseRetirement Center. The first case involved an eighty four year old woman who I will refer to asMargaret. Margaret had suffered a severe stroke localized in her right hemisphere resulting incomplete paralysis on her left side and aphasia. Her speech loss was complete and, when I beganworking with her, three months of speech therapy had yielded little result Her voice was barelymore than a whisper and she was able to only mumble one or two syllables to express basic needs.This communication was very frustrating for her, and she often cried through these briefexchanges. Her daughters told me of her love for music and how they had sung together at familygatherings. I initially saw Margaret to establish her interest in music listening experiences. On myfirst visit; I explained my reason for coming and informed her that I had brought a variety of tapeswith me which I planned to play in the hopes that she could nod to the selections she liked. Thisseemed acceptable to Margaret and she smiled. I inserted the first tape, a Mitch Miller sing alongcollection, and the first song, \"Shine on Harvest Moon\", began. Spontaneously, Margaret beganto sing the song in full voice. Though her diction was poor, words could be distinguished. Afterfollow-up consultation with her speech therapist and neurologist; it was determined that though thebrain had been affected in the speech area, there was apparently no damage to the primary sectionthat mediates singing, a portion of the brain separate from the speech areas. In continuing musictherapy sessions, I worked with Margaret to re-open her llnes of communication by helping her tosing her requests and responses. This work was successful resulting in a decrease in frustrationduring attempts to communicate. The second case study of a client I will refer to as Anna is an excellent example of how musiccan enrich the lives of the \"well\" older adults. At age 92, Anna initiated her own placement to thenursing home following her husband's death as she did not wish to be a burden to her only child.Anna was mentally alert and oriented with her primary complaint being arthritis pain whichimpaired her mobility. Though she experienced cataract removal and a lens implant, overall Annapresented as an essentially healthy, alert individual. She quickly became involved in all aspects ofthe music program in the nursing home. Anna became the song leader of hymns at the protestantreligious services and attended every sing along, music groups, and program featuring a guestmusician. When she was in her room, Anna would often hum to herself or listen to the radio.Being very modest; she was quick to brush off compliments with a smile, usually indicating thatwhat she lacked in quality she made up for in volume. She reports that her involvement in music110 is the key factor that keeps her aler, healthy and happy because she feels useful and involved. Anna's health continues to be excellent and her level of musical involvement remains high. These case studies help to illustrate some of the underlying theoretical principles of music therapy intervention with older adults First, music motivates overall participation, reaching even the most regressed, unresponsive patient. Because the auditory nerve bundle first enters the brain at the leve of the brain stem, music stimulates brain activity even when the individual can not give an overt response. Secondly, music serves to reinforce general reality orientation by extending the time that patients can functionally participate in the here and now. Because music is a temporal art (based on regular pulse occurring over time), response to the real stimulus of music occurring in the environment allows individuals to function in the present moment. Thirdly, music is a natural social activity that allows for communicaton, group functoning, and interpersonal interactions. A fourth theoretical principle of music therapy involves the emotional nature of music. We have learned to associate emotion with music, making it a natural vehicle for expression of feelings so necessary for older individuals dealing with the losses associated with aging. A fourth factor is the ability of music to stimulate movement and exercise, distract from pain, and encourage more physical activity which has a positive impact on physical health of older adults.' Finally, even patients with severe disabilities such as dementia can have a high capacity for functioning in music creating opportunities for more natural interactions with family members and improving their overall quality of life.2 In drawing these remarks to a clo-e, I would like to make some comments about the future use of music therapy services for older individuals. The elderly population continues to grow rapidly while there is a continuing shortage of health care workers trained to work with this population. he people currently admitted to nursing homes have more serious physical and mental impairments thtan in the past. Though the need is great and music therapy is an efficacious therapeutic modality with older adults, professional music therapists are not entering this work force for simple financial reasons. Given the low reimbursement rates of Medicaid to nursing home facilities and the lack of Medicare reimbursement for music therapy services, many long term care facilities cannot afford to hire a music therapist. Home care agencies will not usually provide a non-reimbursable service, and families burdened by escalating medical costs can not afford services that are not covered. Without reimbursement, older adults will be denied music therapy services that could have significant impact on the mental and physical functioning of older adults. It is my hope that Congress will address the issue of Medicare reimbursement for music therapy services so that older adults can avail themselves of this therapy. 1. Douglass, Donna. (1981).

S. Senate hearing, 'Fcr Young Music and Aging\" has focused particular attention on masic therapy services for older Three specific areas that can potentially be impacted by this hearing are increased awareness of music thesapy as a valid, efficacious health care service to older Americans, appropriations for research and demonstration projects and changes in Federal regulations that effact delivery of services to older adults. Specific areas of concern are outlined as follows: 1. Increased awareness of music therapy services for older adults A. To raise general public awareness of music therapy services through media coverage. B. To increase awareness among legislative, governmental and regulatasy bodies of the applicatons of music therapy. C. To raise the awareness of music therapy applications among professional health care colleagues. D. To maie music therapy services and applicattons known to consumers who may wish to have music therapy as part of their total health care. Although the modem profession of music therapy began in the late 193(Ys in the United States, these is still a pervasive lack of awareness of the existence of this professintal discipline ard its standards, practices aid research. Public relation efforts need to be undertaken to increase she general awareness and acceptance of music therapy services in rual and urban setting and to make infomlatim conacerning specific applications wtdh various client groups including minority arid low-income indlividuats mote readsf available. This will foster inclusion of music therapy in services for the people of all apes with special needsthus provadog an effective, unique treaument omodality for many people and increasing employment opportunides for professionally trined music therapists. 2.

A. To have Congress dhe Sectry of Education or others ina positon of authority designate music therapy research ard projeets as eligible for funrdng with special projects money. Though some research has been done to document the effectiveness of music therapy services, especially in meeung die specific needs of older adults, many areas of investigatimn need so he further expl .The efficacy of muwic therapy has been demonstrated through extensive clinical pracdte. Model demonstration projects, basic scientific research, and clinical outcome research can extend and futher validate mwic therapy applications. Demonstration projects expand music therapy services to facilities offering services so older adults, their families and their communities. Basic scientific research may document specific neurological and physiological processes involving the influence of music on behavior. Clinical outcome research provides much needed evaluation of treatment effects. A modest allocation of Federal funds would allow professional music therapists to make substantial progress in these needed areas of study. 3. To influence legislation and regulation that impacts the availability of music therapy services to older Americans and other populations A. To include language in the Older Americans Act or other appropriate legislation audthriing 1. demonstration projects focusing on music therapy in long-term care, senior centers, preventative health services. in-home services fir frail individuais, interyenerational programs, programs to meet the special needs of minority and low-income older individuals and other programs for older Americans and their caretakers. 2. education and training projects. including establishment of a non-degree equivalency program at a post-secondary insitudon of learning fo retuaning musicians for careers in music therapy with older adults.

We have established the first Seniors Program for older developmentally disabled senior citizens in the City of Philadelphia. Congress has seen in its wisdom the need for programs for developmentally disabled infants and handicapped school children. It recognizes the need for real work opportunities for developmentally disabled adults. Please, remember the senior citizen who is develoomentallv disabled. and who in many cases has not had the benefit of any early education or work experiences. They are truly the 'doubly devalued forgotten' poculation. Over 11% of the general population is over 65 years of age. Of that 11% one to one-half million are estimated to be developmentally disabled. As the general population has been aging so has the handicapped population, at about the same rate. No planning for or provision of services have been designed for this emerging senior handicapped population either by the developmental disabilities service delivery system or the service delivery system for the aged. The literature is only just beginning to discuss this problem and few programs have been designed to address this need. We at Philadelphia Developmental Disabilities Corporation have started and are expanding a model program to provide services for the community based senior citizen who is developmentally disabled. other Philadelphia agencies are meeting with us to procure information on how they can also implement programs.115 Music and Music Therapy have been found to be one of the most effective components of our program for this special senior citizen population. Our older adults are not only experiencing the physical and cognitive changes of aging but are doubly devalued by society because of being developmentally disabled. Our seniors have few family members who can advocate for them, limited social contacts and few social-recreational programs available to them. They are not accepted into Senior Citizen Centers because of deeply ingrained attitudes and beliefs. Senior Citizens in our society are already a devalued population and they do not want to be equated with \"those people\". we have found that music activities and music therapy help our special seniors develop a social interaction and sharing with others that is much like that seen in a non-handicapped senior center. Music assists our special seniors to remember the past and stay in touch with the present. Music motivates physical activity and exercise and, perhaps most important, provides an outlet for creative self expression. Let me share some vignettes with you about our special senior population, ages 55 and up: Shirley is a member of our Seniors Program who lives at home with her elderly mother and handicapped sister. She has worked in our sheltered workshop for 33 years, sitting quietly at her work station doing bench work. She was described as shy and very withdrawn -a person who was easily frightened by new people and new experiences -afraid to look people directly in the eye. Music activities in the Seniors Program, such as song discussion, Name That Tune and instrumental music playing, have helped Shirley 'blossom like a flower in spring\". She smiles frequently, welcomes new members and visitors, and \"talks your ear off.\" Sydney was admitted to a state residential institution for the mentally retarded when he was ten years old. He spent 34 years of his life in that same institution before being placed in a community sheltered living situation. Sydney was the first member of the Seniors Program and found a place where he could express his fascination with music. He sings all the old songs, improvises on Orff instruments and is \"the life of the party\".116 George had a very unstable childhood, never had a chance to learn to read, experienced trouble with the law and struggled with a drinking problem. His records consistently describe him as very dependent with an extremely poor self image. In the Fall of 1990, as a member of our sheltered workshop, he was enrolled in our seniors Program where we discovered he had a previously unknown natural singing talent. Subsequently he auditioned and became a member of the Bright Hopes, an elite musical performing group sponsored by our agency whose members exhibit exceptional musical talent. His involvement with the Bright Hopes has given him a sense of pride in his achievements, a feeling of group membership and a sense of belonging. In previous years George was a consistent winner of gold medals for track in the local Special Olympics until a heart condition and deteriorating knees prevented his participation. His participation in music has filled a void in George's life and brought him even more acclaim. Weekly musical rehearsals with the Bright Hopes and participation in the Seniors Program are highlights in George's life. These are but a sample of the vignettes that can be written for the over one million developmentally disabled senior citizens in the United States if programs like ours can be researched and replicated. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons states that such persons have the -same fundamental rights as their fellow-citizens of the same age, which implies first and foremost, the right to enjoy a decent life, as normal and full as possible\" (United Nations, 1975, Art. 3). Please, remember the senior citizen who is developmentally disabled. We can begin to meet their needs with music in programs for seniors with developmental disabilities. Music Therapy is an old idea that is teaching us much about the needs and nature of mankind as we explore, experience and research the effectiveness and the necessity of music in our lives -- and in the lives of all people of all ages and all walks of life.

McCurry Trauma Chaplain Cook County Hospital Chicago, illinois August 1, 1991 Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee: Senator Reid, I appreciate your invitation to submit testimony for this committee's hearing to examine the use of music as a healing tool. Since hearing is one of our first senses to develop in the womb and is our last sense to leave before death, your focus on healing music truly encompasses our entire life span. These tones, rhythms, melodies, words, songs and other components of our musical healing tool kit provide all health care givers and especially musictherapists, a vast array of treatment modalities for patients and their families. As trauma chaplain in Cook County Hospital, the nation's fifth largest public hospital, I have also seen music provide great healing for doctors, nurses, social workers and other health care givers as well. Cook County Hospital, with its network of community clinics, has always served the poorest, and thus the sickest population of Chicago. Our in-padent and out-patient census. on any one day, will encompass a greater variety of physical and social ills than many medical practitioners wlll see in a lifetime. They come to us overwhelmed by illness. Experience quickly teaches the limits of our surgical and pharnacological tools without an array of other therapies to enlist the patient's own will-to-lve. Rooted in the very rhythms of heartbeat and respiraton, music, at Cook County Hospital, well serves these therapeutic needs. Other scientists, physicians, professional musicians, music therapists, patients and their families will be providing to the committee the medical and case history basis for the strength of music as a healing tool. As a chaplain, I have witnessed the use of music as a treatment modality. I am not a music therapist. There is, unfortunately, no certified music therapist on our staff and to my knowledge the hospital has never employed a trained music therapist. In all cases, however, both the role of music and that of the chaplain, are considered but one part of the professional treatment team, subject to all of the hospital's protocols and procedures for patient care. The skills and training of professional music therapists are essential to draw upon the full range of benefits which music can provide to the health care team. Gerontology Unit Memorable music runs throughout the life experiences of our older generations and can be used to assist in their healthcare treatment today. Most prominent is its role in the treatment of the terninally and fatally ill patients in which an older populabon predominates. With both patient and family, each of the steps of grief and leave-taking can be addressed musically with demonstrably effective results. Music catalyzes many life events at this time. Its melodies evoke the strengths of ast life fully lived with family and friends, its lyrics give voice to words of grief or joy that may e difficult to express at this time, its presence within the health care setting provides a continuity to a life which is being thought of primarily as something now at an end. Equally important, music provides stool kit of energetic memories to fuel the rehabilitation procedures of physical therapy and occupational therapy for seniors feeling burdened by bodies which don't respond as they once did. Wheelchair waltzes, the \"Cook County Cake Walk\", exercised to the \"golden oldiies\" are available to patients at all levels of physical and mental acuity. Especially with seniors, music making, on a variety of instruments, is as crucial as musical response and listening. Summary Throughout Cook County Hospital, music is used in a wide variety of therapeutic ways with people of all ages. Music heals as it reaches through scar tissues of illness to touch the strengths of the imagination. Thank you. Dan McCurry can be reached at Ste. 2W, 5516 S.

The bill would amend the Older Americans Act to define music therapy, and to include music therapy both as a supportive service and a preventive health service. The bill would also authorize funding for music therapy research and demonstration projects, as well as education, training and information dissemination. Most of the provisions of the bill were passed by the U.S. Senate on November 12, 1991, as part of an Older Americans Act reauthorization bill. On April 9, 1992, the House of Representatives passed all of the provisions approved by the Senate. At the time of this printing, a final version of the legislation had not yet been signed into law by the President. The bill approved by the Senate and House includes music therapy in the following ways: 1) Defines music therapy as, \"the use of musical or rhythmic interventions specifically selected by a music therapist to accomplish the restoration, maintenance or improvement of social or emotional functioning, mental processing, or physical health of an older individual.\" 2) Adds music therapy to a list of supportive services, such as home health and reader services, that are designed \"to assist older individuals in avoiding institutionalization and to assist individuals in long-term care institutions who are able to return to their communities\" These services are provided by state and area agencies on aging under state plans. 3) Adds music therapy to a list of services designed to enable older individuals \"to attain and maintain physical and mental well-being.\" 4) Adds music therapy to a list of services designed to satisfy special needs and quality of life of older individuals, particularly those with greatest economic and social need. 5) Defines music therapy as a preventive health service, such as routine health screening and nutritional counseling. 6) Creates new demonstration and research projects that \"advance the understanding of the efficacy and benefits of providing music therapy to older individuals.\" 7) Institutes education, training and information dissemination projects for music therapists about gerontology and for the aging network about music therapy.ISBN 0-16-038346-3 1 i I I III II I90I09 78010 846 I "}
