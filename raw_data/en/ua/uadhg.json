We'll never return to the old world or to the old 'normal,' there's no going backwards. This is what the new now looks like to me.\" If COVID reality and raging white nationalism have dampened Donatella's spirits seven months later, she's keeping her angst under wraps in a mind over matter Versace Resort 2022 Campaign that has an infectious, optimistic spirit. The Medusa has taken a psychedelic spin toward a Summer of Love, lensed by Lea Colombo [ [IG](https://www.instagram.com/leacolombo/)]. It may be 110-degrees in Puglia or its reverse \u2014 snowing in July seaside \u2014 but optimism is self-created, even when circumstances are dire. If we're not in denial and actively trying to save the planet, our heads are in the right place. If we're still marching for social justice, the activewear should be polished. We're doing our best to find a new groove, inspired here by Versace models Willems and Ryan Park. Just make refusal your middle name, and we're going to get through this. NEVER let them see you sweat. That's the AOC approach, and I speak from experience. ~ Anne "}
