Meningitidis IgG Vaccine Response FORWARD Specimen Type Describes the specimen type validated for testing Serum Specimen Required Defines the optimal specimen required to perform the test and the preferred volume to complete testing Draw blood in a plain, red-top tube(s). Spin down and send 0.5 mL serum refrigerated. Note: Serum gel tube is acceptable, but must pour off into a plastic vial. Specimen Minimum Volume Defines the amount of sample necessary to provide a clinically relevant result as determined by the testing laboratory. The minimum volume is sufficient for one attempt at testing.

May include intervals based on age and sex when appropriate. Intervals are Mayo-derived, unless otherwise designated. If an interpretive report is provided, the reference value field will state this. Reference Ranges (pre-vaccination): Serogroup Neisseria serogroups included in the licensed meningococcal vaccine. The meningococcal vaccine response is best evaluated by testing pre-vaccination and post-vaccination samples in parallel. A two-fold or greater increase for at least two sero-groups is expected when comparing post-vaccination to pre-vaccination results. N. meningitidis IgG levels peak approximately one month post-vaccination, but decline markedly by two years. Fees Several factors determine the fee charged to perform a test.

Test Classification Provides information regarding the medical device classification for laboratory test kits and reagents. Tests may be classified as cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and used per manufacturer instructions, or as products that do not undergo full FDA review and approval, and are then labeled as an Analyte Specific Reagent (ASR) product. This test was developed and its performance characteristics have been determined by Quest Diagnostics. Performance characteristics refer to the analytical performance of the test. CPT Code Information Provides guidance in determining the appropriate Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code(s) information for each test or profile. The listed CPT codes reflect Mayo Clinic Laboratories interpretation of CPT coding requirements. It is the responsibility of each laboratory to determine correct CPT codes to use for billing. CPT codes are provided by the performing laboratory. LOINC\u00ae Information Provides guidance in determining the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) values for the order and results codes of this test. LOINC values are provided by the performing laboratory. |Test Id ||Test Order Name Result Name || Result LOINC Value | Applies only to results expressed in units of measure originally reported by the performing laboratory. These values do not apply to results that are converted to other units of measure. |Z0726 ||Serogroup A ||42986-0 W-135 ||39610-1 | "}
