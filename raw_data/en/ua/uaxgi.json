It is less than 1% of total body calcium that supports these critical metabolic functions. The body uses bone tissue as a reservoir for calcium, as well as a source of calcium, to maintain constant concentrations of calcium in blood, muscle and intercellular fluids. The remaining 99% of the calcium supply in the body is stored in the bones and teeth, serving as a mineral reserve and structural support for the body. Activated Calcium provides three unique forms of highly-absorbed calcium to ensure maximum absorption of this important macromineral. While most calcium supplements use only a single source of calcium, which can easily overwhelm a single pathway of absorption and limit uptake, Activated Calcium takes advantage of three unique pathways of absorption by providing calcium in the hydroxyapatite, di-calcium malate, and glycinate forms. In addition, Activated Calcium includes vitamin D and phosphorus, both critical nutrients for bone mineralization and remodeling.$40.00 - [Phosphatidylcholine 40% Powder](/products/phosphatidylcholine-40-powder-300-grams-10-6-ounce) 30 GramsCategories: is excellent for emulsifying fat, making this nutrient extremely valuable for liver health.

This enzyme has been clinically tested and found to break down food-derived histamine in the digestive tract. DAO is not absorbed and does not have systemic activity. Histamine Enzyme does not manage or address antibody-related or allergies.* Histamine is a bioactive or \"vasoactive\" amine produced in the body in response to an injury or foreign substance. It has an array of physiological effects, including increasing blood supply to specific sites in the body. In addition, histamine is involved in the immune response, regulation of gastric acid, permeability of blood vessels, contraction of muscles, and the normal response to inflammation. The highest concentrations of histamine in the body are found in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and skin, with lesser amounts in the brain and heart.* Histamine is not only produced in the body but is also present in many fermented foods, such as sauerkraut, sausage, cheese, yogurt, and alcoholic beverages. Tuna, olives, spinach, eggplant, avocados, tomatoes, cherries, and citrus fruits are other histamine-containing foods. Despite their absence of histamine, some foods, such as berries, tea, and a variety of spices, stimulate the endogenous production of the amine due to their benzoate content. In addition, microbial fermentation can convert the histidine in high-protein foods to histamine so that the histamine content of food can increase over time.$67.95 - [Seacure](/products/seacure) 180 CapsulesCategories: Seacure\u00ae provides an easy-to-absorb source of quality protein and bioactive peptides that nourish the intestinal lining.
