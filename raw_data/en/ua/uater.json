Z OL ER MDedge News The Society of Critical Care Medicine re- leased its first set of guidelines for man- aging critically ill patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on March 20, 2020. The 49 recommendations and statements it in- cluded are geared to \"support hospital clinicians managing critically ill adults with COVID-19 in the ICU. The target users of this guideline are frontline clinicians, allied health profession- als, and policy makers involved in the care of patients with COVID-19 in the I C U,\" said the document, written by a panel of 36 experts orga- nized by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, a joint program of the Society of Critical Care Medi- cine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. The document divides the recommendations into four categories: infection control, which includes 3 \"best-practice\" statements and 5 \"weak\" recommendations; hemodynamics, with 2 \"strong\" recommendations and 13 weak ones; ventilation, with 1 best-practice statement, 6 strong recommendations, and 12 weak recom- mendations; and therapy, with 7 weak recom- mendations. The guidelines also included five E- c igarettes: Gateway to sm ok ing regu lar c igarettes B Y J AK E REMAL Y MDedge News Youth who use e-cigarettes are five times more likely to become regular cigarette users 1 year later, according to a study published in the American Journal of Preven- tive Medicine. In addition, the number of days of e-cigarette use at baseline correlates with the number of days of cigarette smoking 1 year lat- er, said Olatokunbo Osibogun, MBBS, PhD, a researcher in the department of epidemiology at Florida International University, Miami, and colleagues. \"These results call for careful consid- eration of e-cigarettes' harm reduction potential in the society and for strong policy and regula- tory efforts to protect the American y o u t h ,\" Dr. Osibogun and colleagues said. E-cigarettes are the most common tobacco or nicotine product used by youth in the United States. Their popularity \"is happening at a time when e-cigarettes are promoted as a tobacco harm reduction product that offers hope for adult smokers who could not quit o t h e r w i s e ,\" the researchers said. \"The balance between these Celebrating 10 YearsP R SR T ST D U .S.

Prior studies examining this question were cross-sectional, did not adjust for relevant covariates, or had small sample sizes or short follow-up durations, the researchers said. Some looked at experimentation, not regular use. Data from the Population As- sessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) cohort provide an opportu- nity to study the gateway question in a way that addresses limitations of previous studies, they said. The P A TH S t u d y The PATH Study is an ongoing, nationally representative, longitudi- nal cohort study of approximately 46,000 adults and youth aged 12 years and older in the United States.

They defined current e-cigarette use as e-cigarette use in the past 30 days among cigarette nonsmokers (that is, those who did not report cigarette smoking in the past 30 days). They defined regular cigarette smoking at Wave 2 and Wave 3 as reported cigarette smoking on 20 or more days in the past 30 days. The researchers adjusted for co- variates such as age, sex, race or ethnicity, parents' education, sensa- tion-seeking behavior, other tobacco product use, alcohol use, marijuana use, prescription drug abuse, living with a tobacco user, susceptibility to cigarette smoking, and noticing cigarette health warning labels. The researchers applied multivariable lo- gistic regression models to evaluate associations between current e-cig-arette use at baseline and regular cigarette smoking at follow-up. Among 7,438 youth, 5.3% of cur- rent e-cigarette users at Wave 1 and Wave 2 reported regular cigarette smoking 1 year later, compared with 0.3% of participants who were not using e-cigarettes. In the 2-year pro- gression analysis, which included 7,185 participants, 8.2% of current e-cigarette users identified at Wave 1 reported regular cigarette smoking 2 years later, compared with 0.8% of participants who were not using e-cigarettes at baseline. In the multi- variable logistic regression analyses,current e-cigarette users had five times higher odds of regular cigarette smoking in the 1-year progression model, compared with participants who were not current e-cigarette users. In the 2-year progression model, current e-cigarette users had 3.4 times higher odds of regular cigarette use, but this result was not statistically significant. \" Additionally, for every unit increase in the number of days of e-cigarette use at baseline, there was an increase in the number of days of cig- arette smoking by 0.4 in the 1-year progres-sion model, \" Dr. Osibogun and colleagues reported. Not all participants in the main analyses were naive to cigarette use, but a sensitivity analysis that focused on participants who had never used cigarettes at baseline also found that e-cigarette users had higher odds of s ubsequent cigarette smoking. The findings \"offer strong support to e-cigarettes' potential to lead to regular cigarette smoking among y o u t h ,\" the researchers said. \"By fo- cusing on use patterns that are un- likely to reflect experimentation but rather represent robust transitions, this study shows that e-cigarette use precedes and strongly predicts regular cigarette smoking, even after adjusting for factors known to pre- dispose to cigarette smoking. \" Q u ant ifying harm s The study provides one more sig- nificant piece of circumstantial evidence that e-cigarette smoking is associated with increased probabil- ity of cigarette smoking, said Frank T.Leone, MD, FCCP , commenting on the study. Dr. Leone is associate professor of medicine at University of Pennsylvania Medical Center and director of Penn Medicine's Comprehensive Smoking Treatment Program, both in Philadelphia. Var- ious studies point in the direction that e-cigarette use causes nicotine dependence in \"some substantial portion of the adolescent popula- Continued on following page Dr. Leone 01_4thru7_CHPH20_4.indd 5 4/2/20 10:04 AM 6 APRIL 2020 CHEST PHYSICIANtion, \" he said. \"That has serious con- sequences. \" In adolescents, the central nervous system is highly plastic. E-cigarette use may cause structural changes to the brain that create \"a perfect storm\" where the development of tobacco dependence is far more likely, said Dr. Leone. E-cigarette use may not be deterministic, but \"the chances are way higher. \" Whether e-cigarette use reduces harm relative to cigarettes remains an open question, and the harms of e-cigarettes are not well characterized, he said. Even assuming that e-ciga- rettes do benefit certain patients, does the benefit outweigh the harm of pro- moting nicotine dependence? Physical harms such as lung cancer and emphysema may take decades to develop. \"But what about doing well in school? Other addic- tions? Trouble with attention? Anxi- ety and depressive disorders? Those kinds of harms are intrinsically difficult to c a p t u r e ,\" Dr. Leone said. \"Those are the harms that are most likely to affect this group of p e o p l e .\" In addition, the wide range of e-cig- arette products and modes of delivery means that the ability to calculate harm with \"any kind of reliability ... goes right out the window, \" he said. \"There are lots of breadcrumbs that keep getting dropped that should give us pause, should make us take a step back, and think, 'Things that I may have assumed to be true in the begin- ning may no longer be true and how should that affect my calculus?' \" The study authors disclosed sup- port from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the National Institutes of Health, and Florida International University. j rem aly @ m d ed ge.c om SOU RCE: O s ib ogun O e t al.

It did not help. The ALA gave failing grades to 43 states in its State of Tobacco Control report, along with three A's , one C, and four D's. Each state's annual funding for to- bacco prevention and cessation was calculated and then compared with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommended spend- ing level. That percentage became the grade, with any level of funding at 80% or more of the CDC's rec- ommendation getting an A and any- thing below 50% getting an F. The three A's went to Alaska - which spent $10.14 million, or 99.4% of the CDC-recommended $10.2 million - California (96.0%), and Maine (83.5%). The lowest lev- els of spending came from Georgia, which spend just 2.8% of the CDC's recommendation of $106 million, and Missouri, which spent 3.0%, rfrank i@ m d ed ge.c om State grades: Tobacco prevention and cessation funding, 2020 IMNG Print ColorsIMNG Print Colors w/ white rule144779.graphic AD.C.

U sefu l gu id e for nonsp ecialist s Some critical care medicine physicians saw the new guidelines as offering no surprises, but providing a very useful resource to guide man- agement, especially for clinicians who may be- come involved in caring for COVID-19 patients despite having little experience car- ing for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). \"For those of us who man- age ARDS patients all the time, this is not a lot of new information, but many crit- ically ill COVID-19 patients are now being cared for by physicians who have not cared for these patients b e f o r e ,\" commented Mangala Narasimhan, DO, FCCP , a critical care medicine physician at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y . In fact, Dr. Narasimhan and associates took the new guidelines soon after their release and used them to create a one-page summary sheet to give to all their colleagues who are now seeing COVID-19 patients, she said in an interview. \"The guidelines are very important for clinicians who are suddenly taking care of a roomful of pa- tients with ARDS. \"\"A lot of people want to know this informa- tion, \" agreed David M. Ferraro, MD, FCCP , a pul- monologist and critical care medicine physician at National Jewish Health in Denver. Perhaps the only potentially controversial as- pect of the guidelines are a couple of weak rec- ommendations that suggest using a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) rather than noninvasive positive in patients with acute hypoxemic respi- ratory failure who have not fully responded to conven- tional oxygen therapy. \"This is controversial, and some of my colleagues are debating this, \" said Dr. Narasimhan, but she noted that her clinic has decided to follow the recommended preference for HFNC, which seemed to have modest advantages over NIPPV in a recent meta-analysis (Intensive Care Med. 2019 May;45[5]:563-72). Another issue with NIPPV is the higher risk for viral dispersion it seems to have, compared with a HFNC, said Dr. Ferraro. If a patient's mask comes off during NIPPV , it creates a substantial risk for aerosolization of virus. That risk is likely lo wer with HFNC, especially a HFNC system that uses a small cannula without heating or humid- ification of the gas flow. \" I 'd recommend against NIPPV , \" Dr. Ferraro said. He also highlighted the value of quickly forgoing continued use of either of these ven- tilatory approaches in a declining patient and having a low threshold to switch to intubation. \"Many clinicians now favor erring on the side of early intubation, \" he noted, an approach that the new guidelines endorsed in a best-practice statement: \"In adults with COVID-19 receiving NIPPV or HFNC we recommend close mon- itoring for worsening respiratory status and early intubation in a controlled setting if wors- ening occurs. \" One aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic that the new guidelines don't address are some of the challenges being faced from skyrocketing numbers of patients and inadequate supplies and manpower to meet their acute clinical needs. \"We need recommendations on how systems should manage when they are overwhelmed, \" comment- ed Dr. Ferraro, an omission that he also saw in the COVID-19 management guidance released on March 13, 2020, by the World Health Organi- zation. \"Neither document gets into this in depth, but that wasn't in their s c o p e ,\" Dr. Ferraro acknowl- edged. He said that recommendations on how to deal with scarce resources, inadequate staffing, and the health of clinicians are probably best handled on a state or local level rather than try- ing to create recommendations that are applicable to the entire U.S. health system. Dr. Narasimhan and Dr. Ferraro reported that they had no disclosures. m z oler@ m d ed ge.c omNonsp ec ialists treating COV ID- 1 9 p atients m ay need this gu id anc e // continued from page 1 Dr. Narasim han Dr. FerraroB Y ROXANNE NEL SON, RN, B SN Cancer surgeries may need to be delayed as hospitals are forced to allocate resources to a surge of COVID-19 patients, says the American College of Surgeons, as it issues a new set of recommenda- tions in reaction to the crisis. Most surgeons have already cur- tailed or have ceased to perform elec- tive operations, the ACS notes, and recommends that surgeons continue to do so in order to preserve the nec- essary resources for care of critically ill patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The new clinical guidance for elective surgical case triage during the pandemic includes recommenda- tions for cancer surgery as well as for procedures that are specific to certain cancer types. First, decisions about whether to proceed with elective surgeries must consider the available resources of lo- cal facilities. The parties responsible for preparing the facility to manage coronavirus patients should be shar- ing information at regular intervals about constraints on local resources, especially personal protective equip- ment (PPE), which is running low in many jurisdictions. For example, if an elective case has a high likelihood of needing postoperative ICU care, it is imperative to balance the risk of delay against the need of availability for patients with COVID-19. Second, care coordination should use virtual technologies as much as possible, and facilities with tumor boards may find it helpful to locate multidisciplinary experts by virtual means, to assist with decision making and estab- lishing triage criteria. Three p hases of p and em icThe ACS has also organized de- cision making into three phases that reflect the acuity of the local COVID-19 situation:Phase I. Semi-Urgent Setting (Preparation Phase) - few COVID-19 patients, hospital re- sources not exhausted, institution still has ICU ventilator capacity and COVID-19 trajectory not in rapid escalation phase Phase II. Urgent Setting - many COVID-19 patients, ICU and ven-tilator capacity limited, operating room supplies limited Phase III. Hospital resources are all routed to COVID-19 patients, no ventilator or ICU capacity, op- erating room supplies exhausted; patients in whom death is likely within hours if surgery is deferred Thoracic cancer su rgeryThoracic cancer surgery guide- lines/uni00A0 follow those for/uni00A0breast cancer. Phase I should be restricted to pa- tients whose survival may be impact- ed if surgery is not performed within next 3 months. These include: Cases with solid or predominantly solid (>50%) lung cancer or pre- sumed lung cancer (>2 cm), clini- cal node negative Node-positive lung cancer Post-induction therapy cancerEsophageal cancer/uni00A0T1b or greater Chest wall tumors that are poten- tially aggressive and not manage- able by alternative means Stenting for obstructing esopha- geal tumor Staging to start treatment astinoscopy, diagnostic video-as-sisted thoracoscopic surgery forpleural dissemination) Symptomatic mediastinal tumors Patients who are enrolled in thera- peutic clinical trials. Phase II would permit surgery if survival will be impacted by a delay of a few days. These cases would include nonseptic perforated cancer of esoph- agus, a tumor-associated infection, and management of complications in a hemodynamically stable patient. All thoracic procedures considered routine/elective would be deferred. Phase III restricts surgery to pa- tients whose survival will be compro- mised if they do not undergo surgery within the next few hours. This group includes perforated cancer of esophagus in a septic patient, a pa- tient with a threatened airway, sepsis associated with the cancer, and man- agement of surgical complications in an unstable patient/uni00A0(active bleeding that requires surgery, dehiscence of airway, anastomotic leak with sepsis).

The AAAAI canceled their annual meeting and provided abstracts and access to presenters for press coverage. The study of 80 patients in State College, Pa., found that they waited an average of 44 days from when their doctor sub- mitted the preauthorization request to the insurance company until the practice received the shipment for dis- pensing to the patient, inves- tigator Faoud Ishmael, MD, PhD, of Mount Nittany Medi- cal Group said in an interview. \"The implication here is that these are really the most se- vere patients who, you would argue, need their medications the quickest, and it's taking longer to get them than it would an inhaler, \" Dr. Ishmael said. The study focused on patients with severe asth- ma (n = 60) or urticaria (n = 20) who received a new prescription of monoclonal antibody therapy from March 2014 to August 2019. For asthma treatments, the average time was 45.8 days; for urticaria, 40.6 days (P = .573), Dr. Ishmael said. The researchers divided the total amount of time into two components: insurance plan review and approval (P = .654), and specialty pharmacy review and dispensing of the medicine, each of which averaged 22.8 days (P = .384), he said. He also noted wide disparity in the range of approval times. \"The shortest approval time was 1 day, and the longest 97 days, \" Dr. Ishmael said. \"It's interesting that we had this really broad s p r e a d .\" What's more, the study found no trend for the delays among insurers and specialty pharmacies, Dr. Ishmael added. \"When these prescriptions get sub- mitted, it's like a black b o x ,\" he said. \"It really seems arbitrary why some of them take so long and some of them don't. \" The findings were independent of typ e of coverage, whether commercial or govern- ment, or even specific insurance plans. \"It's more the process that is flawed rather than one insurance company being the bad g u y,\" he said. The study also looked at what happened to patients while they were waiting for their pre- scriptions to be delivered. \"What we found is that over half of asthmatics had an exacerbation - 51% had at least one asthma attack where they needed prednisone, \" Dr. Ishmael said (P = .0015), \"and we had three patients admitted to the hospital over that time frame when they were waiting for the drugs. \" One of those patients had been admitted twice, making four total hos- pitalizations. Preliminary data analysis showed that about 40% of the patients who had attacks went to the emergency department. For asthmatics who needed prednisone, the average dose was 480 mg (P = .284) - \"a pretty substantial number, \" in Dr. Ishmael's words. He not- ed that a large portion of the study patients were obese, with a mean body mass index of 33 kg/m2. Other comorbidities prevalent in the study population were hypertension and type 2 diabetes. \"Prednisone is something that could worsen all of those conditions, so it's not a trivial issue, \" he said. The study, however, didn't evaluate costs of the interventions during the delay period vs. the costs of the medications themselves. Of the 80 prescriptions Dr. Ishmael and coauthors submitted, only one was rejected, that person being a smoker, he said. \"I understand these are expensive medicines, but it's counterpro- ductive to delay them because in the long run the insurance company ends up paying for the hospitalization and the drug rather than just the drug, \" he said. Timothy Craig, DO, of Penn State Health Al- lergy, Asthma, and Immunology and professor of medicine and pediatrics at Penn State College of Medicine, both in Hershey, said he was sur- prised at the brevity of the delays reported in Dr. Ishmael's study. \"They do much better than we do with preauthorization, \" he said, noting that, in his experience, these approvals take much lon- ger. He added that his own research has fou nd faulty insurance plan algorithms are at the heart of these delays. \"We need more studies to clarify how much this is interfering with patient care and how much risk they're putting patients in, \" he said. The COVID-19 pandemic poses a double -edged sword for physicians managing patients with severe asthma, Dr. Craig noted. \"Their asth- ma care is important, especially if they do test for COVID-19, \" he said. On the other hand, doctors and nurses attending to COVID-19 patients will have less time to haggle with payers to expedite coverage for biologics for their severe asthma patients, he said. \"I hope the flexibility is there, especially at this time to allow people to get on the biologics and stay on them, \" he said. Dr. Ishmael said these findings have serious im- plications because biologics are getting prescribed ever more frequently for asthma and hives. Steps his practice has taken to streamline the process include following the payer's approval guidelines as closely as possible. This sometimes can mean making sure a patient with severe asthma has been maximized on controller medications be- fore submitting the biologic prescription, he said. Another step is to use drug company programs to remove barriers to coverage. Nonetheless, the approval process can be daunt- ing even when taking those steps, he said. \"Those guidelines that constitute approval may vary a lot from one insurer to another; and sometimes those guidelines are different from the criteria that stud- ies may have used when these drugs were being evaluated in clinical trials, \" he said. It would be helpful, he said, if payers used the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines for biologics.

This new group of patients eligible for nin- tedanib treatment extends the drug's labeling beyond patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or interstitial lung disease (ILD) associated with systemic sclerosis or scleroder-ma, and may come close to doubling the total number of eligible patients. The new, expanded indication \"helps to ful- fill an unmet treatment need, as patients with these life-threatening lung diseases have not had an approved medication until n o w,\" said Banu Karimi-Shah, MD, acting deputy director of the division of pulmonary, allergy, and rheumatology products in the F DA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in a written agency statement that announced the new indication. The FDA first approved nintedanib (Ofev) for treating IPF in October 2014, and then granted a second indication in September 2019 for ILD as-sociated with systemic sclerosis or scleroderma. A recent assessment of 1,285 Canadian pa- tients diagnosed with fibrotic ILD and entered into a national registry (CARE-PF) showed that IPF was the associated diagnosis for 25% of patients, and that the majority of patients had other primary diagnoses such as connective tissue disease ILD in 33% of enrolled patients, unclassifiable ILD in 22%, chronic sensitivity pneumonitis in about 8%, sarcoidosis in 3%, as well as other types (BMC Pulm Med. 2019 Nov 27.doi: 10.1186/s12890-019-0986-4).

A goal of the registry, which has now enrolled nearly 3,700 ILD patients, is to track them se- rially to get a better handle on the prevalence of progressive disease. The percentage of patients with ILD associated with systemic sclerosis or scleroderma is \"relatively small, \" compared with these other two pa- tients subgroups, Dr. Kolb said in an interview.

Interstitial lung disease with autoimmune features may show progressive loss of lung function even before the underlying autoimmune disorder has declared itself within diag- nostic criteria. The expansion of labeling for nintedan-ib to include a broader population of patients with progressive, fibrosing IL D including chronic hypersen-sitivity pneumonitis, IL D with autoimmune features, and idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia pro-vides an option for slowing of disease progression even in the absence of cleanly dif-ferentiated disease etiology, adding an important thera-peutic option for this patient population.

The AAAAI canceled their annual meet- ing and provided abstracts and access to presenters for press coverage. The findings from this study potentially replicated findings in humans that have been reported in preclinical trials. \"Our work showed that type 2 dia- betics with asthma who were treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists had lower levels of periostin, and this provides really one of the first human data to show that these drugs may impact key inflammation pathways in the airway, \" Dinah Foer, MD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, said in an interview. She de- scribed periostin as \"a known critical inducer of airway mucus production and airway responsiveness. \" The study retrospectively evaluat- ed serum samples from the Partners HealthCare Biobank of 161 adults with both asthma and type 2 dia- betes, 42 of whom were on GLP-1R agonists and 119 of whom were taking non-GLP-1R agonist diabetes medications. The study used the Partners Healthcare EHR to identify eligible patients. The study found that periostin levels were significantly decreased in GLP-1R agonist users: 19.1 ng/mL (standard deviation, +14) in the non- GLP-1R agonist group (P = .001), Dr. Foer said. The other known mediators of asthma inflammatory pathways that were measured - in- terleukin-6, IL-8, sCD163, total IgE, and sST2 (soluble suppression of tumorigenesis-2) - showed no differences between the two groups, Dr. Foer said. She said that this was the first human study to show similar results to preclinical models of asthma pathways. \"What was interesting to us was that our findings were robust even when we controlled for covari- ates, \" she added. Thes e findings lay the ground- work for further research into the potential therapeutic role GLP-1R agonists in asthma, Dr. Foer said. \"This supports using periostin as a biomarker for novel therapeutic use of GLP-1R [agonists] in asthma, \" she said. \"At this point, further study is needed to understand the clinical impact of GPL-1R [agonists] in asthma both for patients with type 2 diabetes and potentially in the fu- ture for patients who don't have type 2 diabetes or metabolic disease. \" She added: \"I don't think we're there yet; this is just one foot forward. \" The next step for researchers involves analyzing outcomes in asthmatics with type 2 diabetes on GLP-1R agonist therapy using a larger sample size as well as patients with asthma and metabolic disease, Dr. Foer said. The goal would be to identify corresponding biomarkers. \"There's a terrific conversation in the field about the relationships between metabolism and asthma, \" she said. \"What our data contributes to that is, it suggests a role for met- abolic pathways, specifically as it's related GLP-1R [agonist] signaling pathways in regulating airway in- flammation. \" Mark Moss, MD, associate profes- sor of allergy & immunology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who was to serve as the moderator of the session, was positive about the GLP-1R agonist findings. He said in an interview: \"This is promising research that provides a possible new target for the treatment of asthma. \" Dr. Foer disclosed that she has no relevant financial relationships. c hestp hy sic iannews@ c hestnet.org SOU RCE: F oe r D e t al.

Z OL ER MDedge News Underlying cardiac disease, air- way anomalies, and younger age each independently boost- ed the risk of severe perioperative respiratory adverse events (PRAE) in children undergoing adenotonsil-lectomy to treat obstructive sleep apnea, in a review of 374 patients treated at a single Canadian tertiary referral center. In contrast, the analysis failed to show independent, significant effects from any assessed polysom- nography or oximetry parameters on the rate of postoperative ratory complications. The utility of preoperative polysomnography or oximetry for risk stratification is questionable for pediatric patients scheduled to adenotonsillectomy to treat obstructive sleep apnea, wrote Sherri L. Katz, MD, of the University of Ottawa, and associ- ates in a recent report published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medi- cine, although they also added that making these assessments may be \"unavoidable\" because of their need for diagnosing obstructive sleep ap- nea and determining the need for surgery. Despite this caveat, \"overall our study results highlight the need to better define the complex in- teraction between comorbidities, age, nocturnal respiratory events, and gas exchange abnormalities in predicting risk for PRAE\" after adenotonsillectomy, the researchers wrote. These findings \"are consistent with existing clinical care guide- lines\" and \"cardiac and craniofacial conditions have been associated with risk of postoperative complica- tions in other studies. \" The analysis used data collected from all children aged 0-18 years who underwent polysomnography assessment fol-lowed by adenotonsillectomy at one Canadian tertiary referral center, Children's Hospital of Eastern On-tario in Ottawa, during 2010-2016. Their median age was just over 6 years, and 39 patients (10%) were younger than 3 years at the time of their surgery. More than three-quar- ters of the patients, 286, had at least one identified comorbidity, and nearly half had at least two comor- bidities. Polysomnography identified sleep-disordered breathing in 344 of the children (92%), and diag-nosed obstructive sleep apnea in 256 (68%), including 148 (43% of the full cohort) with a severe apnea-hy- popnea index. Sixty-six of the children (18%) had at least one severe PRAE that required intervention. Specifically the se were either oxygen desatu- rations requiring intervention or need for airway or ventilatory sup- port with interventions such as jaw thrust, oral or nasal airway place- ment, bag and mask ventilation, or endotracheal intubation. A multivariate regression analysis somnography, and oximetry param- eters, as well as age, identified three factors that independently linked with a statistically significant increase in the rate of severe PRAE: airway anomaly, underlying cardiac disease, and young age. Patients with an air- way anomaly had a 219% increased rate of PRAE, compared with those with no anomaly; patients with un- derlying cardiac disease had a 109% increased rate, compared with those without cardiac disease; and patients aged younger than 3 years had a 310% higher rate of PRAE, compared with the children aged 6 years or old- er, while children aged 3-5 years had a 121% higher rate of PRAE, com- pared with older children.

The craniofacial and airway features are differ- ent in each of them and knowledge about the syndrome and the child' s exam will in-fluence decision making. Children with DS , for example, are known to have a higher incidence of OS A with a prevalence estimat-ed at about 7 0 % . OS A in DS is classified as severe in almost 5 0 % . Adenotonsillectomy remains the most common intervention for OS A in children with DS although evidence suggests that there is often residual apnea despite AT. Other therapies are often need- ed. Factors that may influence the presence and severity of OS A in DS include general- iz ed hypotonia, large tongue, midfacial hy-poplasia, small mouth, small airway caliber, and lingual tonsillar hypertrophy. Children with DS also they have a higher incidence of other airway anomalies - laryngomala- cia, subglottic stenosis, and tracheomalacia. In each child referred for adenotonsillec- tomy, careful consideration must be given to potential risks and benefits. Team selec-tion, location and timing of the procedure, preoperative preparations, management of comorbid conditions, and arrangements for postoperative monitoring and manage-ment are considered in those selected as surgical candidates. For children who are not deemed to be appropriate surgical can-didates, alternatives are available and indi- vidualiz ed to the child' s needs. There is clearly more work to be done. W hile this study is limited by its retro- spective nature and potential referral bias, it adds to our medical knowledge by presenting a detailed simultaneous analysis polysomnography and clinical data in a large cohort of children with obstructive sleep apnea who underwent adenotonsillectomy. Notably approximate-ly three-q uarters of these children had at least one comorbid condition. U n-derlying cardiac disease, airway anomalies, and young age were identified as independent predictors of perioperative risks for respiratory adverse events. These findings contrast with previous studies where polysomnography metrics were found to be independent predictors of postoperative respiratory adverse events. This paper is an import- ant addition to medical knowledge and highlights the need to better define the complex interactions among comorbid conditions. dengeorge/nso Patients with an airway anomaly had a 219% increased rate of perioperative respiratory adverse events, compared with those with no anomaly; patients with underlying cardiac disease had a 109% increased rate, compared with those without cardiac disease. 08thru11_CHPH20_4.indd 11 3/31/20 4:39 PM1 2 APRIL 2020 CHEST B RU CE J ANCIN MDedge News SNOWMASS, COLO. - Targeted temperature management maintained at 32-36 degrees Cel- sius is now a strong class I recommendation for all comatose patients who experience return of spontaneous circulation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, including those with nonshock- able rhythms, Erin A. Bohula, MD, PhD, said at the annual Cardiovascular Conference at Snowmass sponsored by the American College of Cardiology. \"Our practice is that there are no absolute contraindications to targeted temperature man- agement at the Brigham. Everybody gets cooled, \" said Dr. Bohula, a cardiologist and critical care specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston. The current ACC/AHA guidelines declare: \"There are essentially no patients for whom tem- perature control somewhere in the range between 32 degrees C [89.6 F] and 36 degrees C [96.8 F] is contraindicated. \" The writing committee cited \"recent clinical trial data enrolling patients with all rhythms, the rarity of adverse effects in trials, the high neurologic morbidity and mortality without any specific interventions, and the preponderance of data suggesting that temperature is an import- ant variable for neurologic recovery\" (Circulation. 2015 Nov 3;132[18 Suppl 2]:S465-82). \" That's a pretty strong statement, \" Dr. Bohula observed. The current guidelines, which date back to 2015, give a class I, level of evidence B recom- mendation for targeted temperature manage- ment (TTM) in patients who are comatose with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after out-of-hospital cardiac involving ventric- ular fibrillation ventricular fibrilla- tion. The bedside definition of comatose is lack of meaningful response to verbal commands to squeeze hands, blink, or move toes. The current recommendation for TTM in pa- tients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with a nonshockable rhythm is class I, level of evidence C, meaning it's based on expert con- sensus. However, that recommendation is now out of date and due for a level-of-evidence up- grade in light of the recent results of the French HYPERION trial, an open-label randomized trial of 584 patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest with a nonshockable rhythm. Although 90-day mortality was similarly high in the TTM and tar- geted normothermia groups, the rate of favorable neurologic outcome as assessed by a C erebral Performance Category scale score of 1 or 2 was 10.2% in the TTM group, significantly better than the 5.7% rate in controls (N Engl J Med. 2019 Dec 12;381[24]:2327-37). The 2010, ACC/AHA guidelines recommended a TTM range of 32-34 degrees C, but on the basis of subsequent persuasive randomized trial data, that range was broadened to 32-36 degrees C in the 2015 guidelines, with a class IB recommenda- tion. Maintenance of TTM for at least 24 hours has a IIa, level of evidence C recommendation in the current guidelines. The guidelines emphasize that specific features may favor selection of one temperature for TTM over another. For example, patients with seizures or cerebral edema might be better off with TTM at a lower temperature, while a higher tempera- ture may be best for those with bleeding or severe bradycardia. At Brigham and Women's Hospital, the default temperature is 33 degrees C. Howev- er, TTM with a goal of 36 degrees C is seriously considered in patients with recent head trauma, major surgery within the past 2 weeks, refractory hypotension, severe sepsis, pregnancy, or high bleeding risk. Rewarming is done at a rate of 0.25 degrees C per hour, with sedation maintained un- til the patient has been returned to 98.6 degrees F, according to Dr. Bohula. Based on several negative studies of TTM using rapid infusion of chilled fluids in the am- bulance en route to the hospital, the guidelines rate that practice class IIIA, meaning don't do it. Avoidance of a systolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg and a mean arterial pressure of less than 65 mm Hg gets a class IIb level of evidence C recommendation to lessen the risk of cerebral hypoxia. TTM a m aj or b reak t hrou gh Prior to the introduction of TTM, comatose pa- tients with ROSC after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest had a dreadful prognosis, with survival rates of 1%-10% in registry studies. In contrast, the survival rate in the landmark TTM clinical trials was 50%-60%. And while that's a dramatic improvement, ROSC after cardiac arrest remains a high-mortality condition. Dr. Bohula was first author of a report by the Critical Care Cardiology Tri als Network, composed of 16 tertiary cardiac intensive care units in the United States and Can- ada. Cardiac arrest was the primary indication for 8.7% of 3,049 consecutive admissions, and its CARDIOL OG Y Card iac arrest: Targeted tem p eratu re m anagem ent m ay b e a gam e c hanger V IEW ON THE NEW S G . H ossein A lm assi, M D , F C C P , com m ent s: The strategy of using systemic hypothermia (temp. 32o C) for protec- tion of the heart is well known to cardiac surgeons in their daily work. Deep Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest (DHCA, body tem- SHUDWXUH \u0015\u0013o or retrograde cerebral perfusion, is a well-established practice for operations involving the aortic arch pathologies of varying complexity. The French HYPER-ION trial and other published work cited in this report are encouraging for appli- cation of TTM in the care of patents with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and return of spontaneous circulation. 38% mortality rate was the highest of all cardiac critical care indications (JAMA Cardiol. 2019 Jul 24;4[9]:928-35). TTM was developed in response to a recog- nition that two-thirds of deaths in patients who make it to the hospital after out-of-hospital car- diac arrest are neurologic - the result of brain anoxia - rather than being due to the myocardial ischemia that may have initially brought them to medical attention. \"Time is brain cells, the same way we think of time as cardiac muscle, \" Dr. Bohula observed. The main idea behind therapeutic hypothermia is that it lowers the cerebral metabolic rate of ox- ygen to reduce the consequences of ongoing an- oxia. The brain doesn't require as much perfusion when cooled. TTM has other beneficial neurologic effects as well: It reduces cerebral blood volume via auto- regulation, decreases intracranial pressure, and blunts the inflammatory response involved in the postcardiac arrest syndrome. In addition, TTM has anticonvulsant properties, an important effect because seizures and/or myoclonus occur in up to 15% of adults who achieve ROSC after cardiac arrest - and in even more of those who are co- matose after doing so. And seizures increase the brain's metabolic rate threefold, resulting in more cerebral ischemic injury, she explained. Seizure activity can be difficult to distinguish from shivering in a patient on TTM. For this rea- son Dr. Bohula recommends putting patients on continuous EEG monitoring from the time of ad- mission, as is the routine practice at the Brigham. She reported serving as a consultant to Daiichi Sankyo, Servier, Lexicon, Kowa, Merck, Novar- tis, Novo Nordisk, and the National Institutes of Health. In addition, she generates institutional research grants provided by a half-dozen phar- maceutical companies. b j anc in@ m d ed ge.c om \" Ou r p rac tic e is that there are no ab solu te c ontraind ic ations to targeted tem p eratu re m anagem ent at the Brigham .

The data indicate that the stability of the new vi- rus is similar to that of SARS-CoV-1, which caused the SARS epidemic, researchers report in an article published on the medRxivpreprint server (medRx- iv. 2020. doi: 10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217). The study has since been published in the New England Journal of Medicine (2020 Mar 17. doi/10.1056/NEJMc200497). Transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, has quickly outstripped the pace of the 2003 SARS epidemic. \"Superspread\" of the earlier disease arose from infection during med- ical procedures, in which a single infected indi- vidual seeded many secondary cases. In contrast, the novel coronavirus appears to be spread more through human-to-human transmission in a va- riety of settings. However, it's not yet known the extent to which asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals spread the new virus through daily routine. To investigate how long SARS-CoV-2 remains infective in the environment, Neeltje van Dore- malen, PhD, of the Laboratory of Virology, Di- vision of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in Hamilton, Mont., and colleagues conducted simulation ex- periments in which they compared the viability of SARS-CoV-2 with that of SARS-CoV-1 in aerosols and on surfaces. Among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, viral loads in the upper respiratory tract are high; as a consequence, respiratory secretion in the form of aerosols (<5 mcm) or droplets (>5 mcm) is likely, the authors note. van Doremalen and colleagues used nebulizers to generate aerosols. Samples of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 were collecting at 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes on a gelatin filter. The research- ers then tested the infectivity of the viruses on Vero cells grown in culture. They found that SARS-CoV-2 was largely stable through the full 180-minute test, with only a slight decline at 3 hours. This time course is similar to that of SARS-CoV-1; both viruses have a median half-life in aerosols of 2.7 hours (range, 1.65 hr for SARS-CoV-1, vs. 7.24 hr for SARS-CoV-2). The researchers then tested the viruses on a va- riet y of surfaces for up to 7 days, using humidity values and temperatures designed to mimic \"a variety of household and hospital situations. \" The volumes of viral exposures that the team used were consistent with amounts found in the hu- man upper and lower respiratory tracts. For example, they applied 50 mcL of virus-con- taining solution to a piece of cardboard and then swabbed the surface, at different times, with an additional 1 mcL of medium. Each surface assay was replicated three times. The novel coronavirus was most stable on plas- tic and stainless steel, with some virus remaining viable up to 72 hours. However, by that time the viral load had fallen by about three orders of magnitude, indicating exponential decay. This profile was remarkably similar to that of SARS- CoV-1, according to the authors. However, the two viruses differed in stay- ing power on copper and cardboard. No viable SARS-CoV-2 was detectable on copper after 4 hours or on cardboard after 24 hours. In contrast, SARS-CoV-1 was not viable beyond 8 hours for either copper or cardboard. \" Taken together, our results indicate that aero- sol and fomite transmission of HCoV-19 [SARS- CoV-2] is plausible, as the virus can remain viable in aerosols for multiple hours and on sur- faces up to days, \" the authors conclude. Andrew Pekosz, PhD, codirector of the Center of Excellence in Influenza Research and Surveil- lance and director of the Center for Emerging Viruses and Infectious Diseases at the Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health, Baltimore, Maryland, applauds the real-world value of the experiments. \"The PCR [polymerase chain reaction] test used [in other studies] detect SARS-CoV-2 just detects the virus genome. It doesn't tell you if the virus was still infectious, or 'viable. ' That's why this study is interesting, \" Pekosz said. \"The inves- tigators and Pekosz have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. A version of this article first appeared on Medscape.com.

BO W SE R MDedge News The toilet bowl, sink, and bath- room door handle of an iso- lation room housing a patient with the novel coronavirus tested positive for the virus, raising the possibility that viral shedding in the stool co uld represent another route of transmission, investigators reported. Air outlet fans and other room sites also tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coro- navirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), though an anteroom, a corridor, and most personal protective equipment (PPE) worn by health care provid- ers tested negative, according to the researchers, led by Sean Wei Xiang Ong, MBBS, of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore. Taken together, these findings suggest a \"need for strict adherence to environmental and hand hygiene\" to combat significant environmental contamination through respiratory droplets and fecal shedding, Dr. Ong and colleagues wrote in JAMA. Aaron Eli Glatt, MD, chair of medicine at Mount Sinai South Nas- sau in New Yor k , said these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is \"clearly capable\" of contaminating bathroom sinks and toilets. \"That wouldn't have been the first place I would have thought of, be- fore this s t u d y,\" he said in an inter- view. \"You need to pay attention to cleaning the bathrooms, which we obviously do, but that's an important reminder. \" The report by Dr. Ong and co- authors included a total of three patients housed in airborne infec- tion isolation rooms in a dedicated SARS-CoV-2 outbreak center in Singapore. For each patient, surface samples were taken from 26 sites in the isolation room, an anteroom, and a bathroom. Samples were also taken from PPE on physicians as they left the patient rooms.Samples for the first patient, taken right after routine cleaning, were all negative, according to researchers. That room was sampled twice, on days 4 and 10 of the illness, while the patient was still symptomatic. Likewise, for the second patient, postcleaning samples were negative; those samples were taken 2 days af- ter cleaning. However, for the third patient, samples were taken before routine cleaning. In this case, Dr. Ong and colleagues said 13 of 15 room sites (87%) were positive, including air outlet fans, while 3 of 5 toilet sites (60%) were positive as well, though no contamination was found in the anteroom, in the corridor, or in air samples. That patient had two stool sam- ples that were p ositive for SARS- CoV-2, but no diarrhea, authors said, and had upper respiratory tract involvement without pneumonia. The fact that swabs of the air ex- haust outlets tested positive suggests that virus-laden droplets could be \"displaced by airflows\" and end up on vents or other equipment, Dr. Ong and coauthors reported. All PPE samples tested negative, except for the front of one shoe. \"The risk of transmission from contaminated footwear is likely low, as evidenced by negative results in the anteroom and corridor, \" they wrote. While this study included only a small number of patients, Dr. Glatt said the findings represent an im- portant and useful contribution to the literature on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Funding for the study came from the National Medical Research Council in Singapore and DSO Na- tional Laboratories.

B OWSER MDedge News ORLANDO - Knowledge of vaping devices, familiarity with terminology, and the ability to quickly pinpoint individuals at risk of lung injury are just a few skills that can help critical care professionals confronted with patients who may have vaping-asso- ciated lung disease, according to a new guidance. The guidance offers a risk-stratifi- cation system that classifies patients into groups based on exposure, symptoms, and imaging results, and provides specific evaluation needs and management strategies for each. The guidance is designed to help critical care professionals efficiently identify those at high risk of re- spiratory failure (Crit Care Explor. 2020;2[2]:e0081). Physicians also need to commu- nicate with patients to identify what substances are being vaped and develop effective methods to en- courage abstinence, according to the authors, led by Craig M. Lilly, MD, FCCP , professor of medicine, anes- thesiology, and surgery at the Uni- versity of Massachusetts, Worcester. \"I would encourage every inten- sivist, when they leave their inten- sive care unit night, [to ask], 'have I advised against vaping today?' \" Dr. Lilly said at the Critical Care Congress sponsored by the Society of Critical Care Medicine. The guidelines, concurrently pub- lished as a review article in Critical Care Explorations, propose the term vaping-associated respiratory dis- tress syndrome (V ARDS), which the authors say constitutes an acute and progressive respiratory syndrome marked by pathologic changes of lung injury and potentially life-threatening hypoxemic respiratory failure. They also introduce the three- group Worcester classification system, which is intended to triage vaping-exposed individuals for risk of V ARDS based on the presence or absence of vaping-related symptoms and infiltrates, and normal or ab- normal oxygen saturation. \"It's very simple, \" said Dr. Lilly, who added that the risk-stratifica- tion model was developed at the re- quest of Massachusetts public health officials. Patients with vaping exposure but no symptoms attributable to vaping, such as cough, chest pain, or weight loss, are classified as Worcester Low Risk and testing is not recommend- ed, he said. By contrast, individuals are con- sidered Worcester Medium Risk if they have vaping exposure, symp- toms, and a vaping-associated abnormal pattern on imaging, but no hyp oxemia; the presence of hy- poxemia would tip the scale toward Worcester High Risk. \"Most patients that have died from vaping have been sent out of emergency rooms when they were noted to be hypoxic, \" Dr. Lilly told meeting attendees. Louella B. Amos, MD, a pediatric pulmonologist at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, said she expects the guidance and risk- stratification system will be useful not only for critical care specialists, but for other health care providers as well. \"It's important to make decisions relatively quickly, depending on the severity of symptoms, and I think this is nice and simple, \" Dr. Amos said in an interview. \"We always triage when we see patients, either at the door or in our clinic, or behind that, even in the hospital, \" she said. \"So I think this can be a great tool for every- body, not only the intensivist, but people who are triaging at the f r o n t .\" Management of individuals at low risk of V ARDS begins with encouragement of abstinence. \"We think that every vaping patient should be advised to quit vaping, \" Dr. Lilly said. Patients who are in- terested in quitting who have not yet worked with someone in their health care team whom they trust can be referred to their primary care physicians for counseling, he added, while those struggling with addic- tion, unable to quit, and unable to CRITICAL CARE Gu id anc e d efines v ap ing- related resp iratory sy nd rom e Dr. Lilly D. Bowser/MDedge Newspartner with a primary care physi- cian can be referred to an addiction medicine specialist. For moderate-risk patients, vaping cessation is \"absolutely m a n d a t o r y,\" said Dr. Lilly, who recommended monitoring of va- ping abstinence, outpatient eval- uation based on imaging studies, and adequate follow-up to ensure symptoms resolve, tests normalize, and daily activities bounce back to baseline levels. The guidance offers more ex- tensive recommendations for the V ARDS high-risk group, including supervised vaping abstinence, con- tinuous pulse oximetry, and early intervention with noninvasive venti- lation, and mechanical ventilation if required, Dr. Lilly said. Judging vaping exposure is chal- lenging, requiring clinicians to have a familiarity with the many different devices that are available. Beyond device type, he added, it's important to know the various terms for devices and lingo that patients may use to describe them, what solutions are vaped, whether those solutions are commercially prepared or off the street, the dose the device delivers, and a number of other factors, he said. Clinical evaluation typically comes down to unexplained cough, chest pain, weight loss, fatigue, or dyspnea, though one other clue is whether there are gastrointestinal symptoms: \"The same way that aerosols can go down to the lungs, they also go into the GI tract, and when nausea, vomiting, or cramp- ing abdominal pain is tightly asso- ciated with vaping exposure, one should assume that the patient has been toxin exposed, \" he explained. Dr. Lilly said he had no financial relationships to disclose. c hestp hy sic iannews@ c hestnet.orgThe guidance offers a risk- stratification system that classifies patients into groups based on exposure, symptoms, and imaging results, and provides specific evaluation needs and management strategies for each.

Prior studies have focused on shift workers because night shift work will influence circadian rhythm and increase CVD risk. But it is increas- ingly recognized that circadian dis- ruption may occur outside of shift work and accumulate over time, particularly given modern lifestyle factors such as increased use of mo- bile devices and television at night, said study coauthor Tianyi Huang, ScD, MSc, of Brigham and Wom- en's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. \"Even if they tend to go to sleep at certain times, by following that life- style or behavior, it can interfere with their planned sleep timing, \" he said. \"One thing that surprised me in this sample is that about one third of participants have irregular sleep pat- terns that can put them at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. So I think the prevalence is higher than expected, \" Dr. Huang added. As reported today in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, the investigators used data from 7-day wrist actigraphy, 1 night of at-home polysomnography, and sleep ques- tionnaires to assess sleep duration and sleep-onset timing among 1,992 Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis participants, aged 45 to 84 years, who were free of CVD and prospectively followed for a median of 4.9 years. A total of 786 patients (39.5%) had sleep duration standard devi- ation (SD) > 90 minutes and 510 (25.6%) had sleep-onset timing SD >90 minutes. During follow-up, there were 111 incident CVD events, including myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease death, stroke, and oth- er coronary events. Compared with people who had less than 1 hour of variation in sleep duration, the risk for incident CVD was 9% higher for people whose sleep duration varied 61 to 90 minutes (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.62-1.92), even after con- trolling for a variety of cardiovascular and sleep-related risk factors such as body mass index, systolic blood pres- s ure, smoking status, total cholesterol, average sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and sleep apnea.Moreover, the adjusted CVD risk was substantially increased with 91 to 120 minutes of variation (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 0.91-2.76) and more than 120 minutes of variation in sleep du- ration (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.24-3.68). Every 1-hour increase in sleep duration SD was associated with 36% higher CVD risk (95% CI; 1.07 - 1.73). Compared with people with no more than a half hour of variation in nightly bedtimes, the adjusted hazard ratios for CVD were 1.16 (95% 0.64- CI, 1.13-3.91) when bedtimes varied by 31 to 60 minutes, 61 to 90 minutes, and more than 90 minutes. For every 1-hour increase in sleep-onset timing SD, the risk of CVD was 18% higher (95% CI; 1.06- 1.31). \"The results are similar for the reg- ularity of sleep timing and the regu- larity of sleep duration, which means that both can contribute to circadian disruption and then lead to develop- ment of cardiovascular disease, \" Dr. Huang said. This is an important article and sig- nals how sleep is an important marker and possibly a mediator of cardio- vascular risk, said Harlan Krumholz, MD, of Ya l e School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, who was not involved with the study. \"What I like about this is it's a nice longitudinal, epidemiologic study with not just self-report, but sensor-detected sleep, that has been correlated with well-curated and adjudicated outcomes to give us a strong sense of this association, \" he told this news organization. \"A n d also, that it goes beyond just the du- ration - they combine the duration and timing in order to give a fuller picture of sleep. \" Nevertheless, Dr. Krumholz said researchers are only at the begin- ning of being able to quantify the various dimensions of sleep and the degree to which sleep is a reflection of underlying physiologic issues, or whether patients are having erratic sleep patterns that are having a toxic effect on their overall health. Questions also remain about the mechanism behind the association, whe ther the increased risk is univer- sal or more harmful for some people, and the best way to measure factors during sleep that can most compre- hensively and precisely predict risk. \"A s we get more information flow- ing in from sensors, I think we will begin to develop more sophisticated approaches toward understanding risk, and it will be accompanied by other studies that will help us understand whether, again, this is a reflection of other processes that we should be pay- ing attention to or whether it is a cause of disease and r i s k ,\" Dr. Krumholz said. Subgroup analyses suggested positive associations between ir-regular sleep and CVD in African Americans, Hispanics, and Chinese Americans but not in whites. This could be because sleep irregularity, both timing and duration, was sub- stantially higher in minorities, espe- cially African Americans, but may also be as a result of chance because the study sample is relatively small, Huang explained. The authors note that the overall findings are biologically plausible be- cause of their previous work linking sleep irregularity with metabolic risk factors that predispose to athero- sclerosis, such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Participants with irregular sleep tended to have worse baseline cardiometabolic profiles, but this only explained a small portion of the associations between sleep irreg- ularity and CVD, they note. Other possible explanations in- clude circadian clock genes, such as clock, per2, and bmal1, which have been shown experimentally to con- trol a broad range of cardiovascular functions, from blood pressure and endothelial functions to vascular thrombosis and cardiac remodeling. Irregular sleep may also influence the rhythms of the autonomic nervous system, and behavioral rhythms with regard to timing and/ or amount of eating or exercise. Further research is needed to un- derstand the mechanisms driving the associations, the impact of sleep irreg- ularity on individual CVD outcomes, and to determine whether a 7-day SD of more than 90 minutes for either sleep duration or sleep-onset timing can be used clinically as a threshold target for promoting cardiometaboli- cally healthy sleep, Dr. Huang said. \"When providers communicate with their patients regarding strat- egies for CVD prevention, usually the y focus on healthy diet and phys- ical activity; and even when they talk about sleep, they talk about whether they have good sleep quali- ty or sufficient sleep, \" he said. In a related editorial, Olaf Old- enburg, MD, Luderus-Kliniken M\u00fcnster, Clemenshospital, M\u00fcnster, Life Sciences, Scu- ola Superiore Sant' Anna, Pisa, Italy, write that the observed independent association between sleep irregu-larity and CVD \"is a particularly striking finding given that impaired circadian rhythm is likely to be much more prevalent than the ex- treme example of shift w o r k .\" They call on researchers to utilize big data to facilitate understanding of the association and say it is essential to test whether experimental data support the hypothesis that altered circadian rhythms would translate into unfavorable changes in 24-hour sympathovagal and neurohormonal balance, and ultimately CVD. The present study \"will, and should, stimulate much needed addi- tional research on the association be- tween sleep and CVD that may offer novel approaches to help improve the prognosis and daily symptom burden of patients with CVD, and might make sleep itself a therapeutic target in CVD, \" the editorialists conclude.

For others it may be delaying preventive care or ad- juvant chemotherapy that's meant to keep cancer from returning or rescheduling appointments. \" Dr. Lichtenfeld emphasized that cancer care teams are going to do the best they can to deliv- er care to those most in need. However, even in those circumstances, it won't be life as usual. \"It will require patience on everyone's part as we go through this pandemic, \" he said. \"The way we treat cancer over the next few months will change enormously, \" writes a British oncologist in an article published in the Guardian. \"A s oncologists, we will have to find a tenuous balance between undertreating people with can- cer, resulting in more deaths from the disease in the medium to long term, and increasing deaths from COVID-19 in a vulnerable patient popula- tion. Alongside our patients we will have to make difficult decisions regarding treatments, with only low-quality evidence to guide u s ,\" writes Lucy Gossage, MD, consultant oncologist at Notting- ham (England) University Hospital. The evidence to date (from reports from Chi- na in the Lancet Oncology) suggests that people with cancer have a significantly higher risk of severe illness resulting in intensive care admis- sions or death when infected with COVID-19, particularly if they recently had chemotherapy or surgery. \"Many of the oncology treatments we currently use, especially those given after surgery to reduce risk of cancer recurrence, have relatively small benefits, \" she writes. \"In the current climate, the balance of offering these treatments may shift; a small reduction in risk of cancer recurrence over the next 5 years may be outweighed by the potential for a short-term increase in risk of death from COVID-19. In t he long term, more people's cancer will return if we aren't able to offer these treatments, \" she adds. P ost p one rou t ine screening One thing that can go on the back burner for now is routine cancer screening, which can be postponed for now in order to conserve health system resources and reduce contact with health- care facilities, says the ACS. \"Patients seeking routine cancer screenings should delay those until further notice, \" said Dr. Lichtenfeld. \"While timely screening is import- ant, the need to prevent the spread of coronavirus and to reduce the strain on the medical system is more important right n o w.\" But as soon as restrictions to slow the spread of COVID-19 are lifted and routine visits to health facilities are safe, regular screening tests should be rescheduled. G u id ance from A S C OThe American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has issued new guidance on caring for patients with cancer during the COVID-19 out- break. First and foremost, ASCO encourages provid- ers, facilities, and anyone caring for patients with cancer to follow the existing guidelines from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention when possible. ASCO highlights the CDC's general recom- mendation for healthcare facilities that suggests \"elective surgeries\" at inpatient facilities be re- scheduled if possible, which has also been recom- mended by the American College of Surgeons. However, in many cases, cancer surgery is not elective but essential, it points out. So this is largely an individual determination that clini- cians and patients will need to make, taking into account the potential harms of delaying needed cancer-related surgery. Systemic treatments, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy, leave cancer patients vul- nerable to infection, but ASCO says there is no direct evidence to support changes in regimens during the pandemic. Therefore, routinely stop- ping anticancer or immunosuppressive therapy is not recommended, as the balance of potential harms that may result from delaying or inter- rupting treatment versus the potential benefits of possibly preventing or delaying COVID-19 infection remains very unclear. Clinical decisions must be individualized, ASCO emphasized, and suggested the following practice points be considered: For patients already in deep remission who are receiving maintenance therapy, stopping treat- ment may be an option. Some patients may be abl e to switch from IV to oral therapies, which would decrease the fre- quency of clinic visits. Decisions on modifying or withholding chemo- therapy need to consider both the indication and goals of care, as well as where the patient is in the treatment regimen and tolerance to the therapy. As an example, the risk-benefit assessment for proceeding with chemotherapy in patients with untreated extensive small-cell lung cancer is quite different than proceeding with maintenance pemetrexed for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. If local coronavirus transmission is an issue at a particular cancer center, reasonable options may include taking a 2-week treatment break or arranging treatment at a different facility. Evaluate if home infusion is medically and lo- gistically feasible. In some settings, delaying or modifying ad- juvant treatment presents a higher risk of compromised disease control and long-term survival than in others, but in cases where the absolute benefit of adjuvant chemothera- py may be quite small and other options are available, the risk of COVID-19 may be con- sidered an additional factor when evaluating care. D elay st em cell t ransp lant sFor patients who are candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplantation, a delay may be reason- able if the patient is currently well controlled with conventional treatment, ASCO comments. It also directs clinicians to follow the recommendations provided by the American Society of Transplanta- tion and Cellular Therapy and from the Europe- an Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation regarding this issue. Finally, there is also the question of prophylac- tic antiviral therapy: Should it be considered for cancer patients undergoing active therapy? The answer to that question is currently un- known, says ASCO, but \"this is an active area of re- search and evidence may be available at any t i m e .\" A version of this article first appeared on Medscape.com.L U NG CANCER Disru p tions in c anc er c are in the era of COV ID- 1 9 Dr. Lic htenfeld \"A s oncologists, we will have to find a tenuous balance between undertreating people with cancer, resulting in more deaths from the disease in the medium to long term, and increasing deaths from COVID-19 in a vulnerable patient population. \"\"While timely screening is important, the need to prevent the spread of coronavirus and to reduce the strain on the medical system is more important right n o w.\" 12_14thru17_CHPH20_4.indd 17 3/31/20 4:42 PM1 8 APRIL 2020 CHEST PHYSICIANNEWS FROM CHEST B Y SAID CHAAB AN, MD; AND P ARIJ A SEN, MD \"Al l things are poison and nothing is without poison, only the dose permits something not to be poisonous. \" Paracelsus once said. A b it of hist ory Oxygen was discovered in 1775 and was since noted to be both vital and poisonous. It was much later in 1899 that it was demonstrated that partial pressures of oxygen up to 75% led to both severe lung injury and death as compared with levels of 40% to 50%. While the administration of oxygen in hypoxic patients is beneficial, this intervention in healthy subjects leads to a reduction in heart rate, cardiac index, and an increase in mean arte- rial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and large artery stiffness. While oxygen itself is not toxic, the reactive oxygen spe- cies that form as a result of ox- ygen metabolism are. A study showed that supplementation of oxygen in patients with COPD, or in women under- going C-section with the use of spinal anesthesia, leads to an increase in reactive oxygen species (Winslow RM. Transfusion . 2013;53[2]:424). Hyperoxia has multiple clinical effects on lung physiology and gas exchange that include worsening hypoxemia secondary to absorptive atelectasis and damage to the airways and lung parenchyma (Sackner MA, et al. Ann Intern Med . 1975;82[1]:40). High levels of inspired oxygen could also lead to accentuation of hypercapnia as explained by the Haldane effect; a reduction of the affinity for carbon dioxide leading to an increase in Pa/C.sc/o.sc2. High oxygen levels can also decrease the hypoxic drive for ventilation leading to worsening hyper- capnia. Hyperoxia is a situation routinely encountered in clinical practice, as well, often resulting from an overzealous attempt to prevent or reverse hy- poxia. ICU physicians, though aware of potential threats of hyperoxia, often fail to translate such concerns in their clinical practice (Helmerhorst HJ, et al. Ann Intensive Care . 2014;4:23). E ffect s of hyp erox ia in C N S and card iov ascu lar d isease The last 2 decades have seen several studies look- ing into the effects of hyperoxia in specific clini- cal scenarios. Arterial hyperoxia was found to be independently associated with in-hospital death in ventilated stroke patients in the ICU, as co m- pared with either arterial normoxia or hypoxia (Rincon F, et al. Crit Care Med. 2014;42[2]:387). The AVOID trial showed that supplemental ox- ygen therapy in patients with ST-elevation myo- cardial infarction, but without hypoxia, increased early myocardial injury with risk of larger myo-cardial infarct size at 6 months. (Stub D, et al. Circulation . 2015;131[24]:2143). H yp erox ia in t he I C UAlthough the potential risks of hyperoxia in conditions such as stroke and cardiac arrest had been observed, the jury was still out on its effects on a critically ill, mixed population, as routinely encountered in the ICU. Oxygen-ICU, a single center trial published in 2016, was one of the first looking at a mixed ICU population, while assess- ing the effects of a conservative oxygen delivery strategy against a conventional one (Girardis M, et al. JAMA. 2016;316[15]:1583). The researchers noted a significant mortality difference favoring conservative oxygen therapy, particularly in in- tubated patients. The IOTA group's systematic review and meta-analysis of 16,000 patients showed an increased relative risk of death in-hospital with hy- peroxia, that persisted over a prolonged period while conferring no obvious advan- tages (Chu DK, et al. Lancet. 2018;391[10131]:1693). With the growing body of evidence, the need of the hour was an ICU-based ran- domized trial that may settle the debate. The 21 center, 1,000 patient ICU-ROX trial promised to deliver on that (Mackle D, et al. N Engl J Med . 2019 Oct 14. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1903297). The study design was more reflective of real-life clinical scenarios than some of its predecessors, with the control group exposed to usual-oxygen therapy instead of liberal hyperoxia. Both groups had a lower saturation threshold of 91% while the conservative-oxygen group had an upper limit of 97% along with a conscious effort made to drop the F/I.sc/o.sc 2 to 21%. Though both groups had similar median Pa/o.sc2 levels, the conservative group spent much greater time (median 29 hours) at 21% F/I.sc/o.sc2 than the usual group (median 1 hour). Sp/o.sc2targets also allowed frequent changes to oxygen delivery without the need for blood gases. Presuming the primary effect of oxygen toxicity would be on t he lungs, the study was powered for a primary outcome of ventilator-free-days, which showed no significant difference among the groups. No significant differences in mortality or other secondary outcomes were observed. The ICU-ROX trial leaves us with a few ques- tions, the most important follow: A re t he d et rim ent al effect s of hyp erox ia lim it ed t o cert ain d isease- sp ecific grou p s or generally ap p licab le? The evidence is substantial in patients with cardiac arrest/myocardial injury. A prespecified subgroup analysis in ICU-ROX indicated a higher number of ventilator-free days with conservative oxygen therapy in patients with hypoxic ischemic enceph- alopathy. When asked, Dr. Paul You n g , one of the investigators of the ICU-ROX group, states, \"These are actually pretty small subgroups, and the num- ber of mortality events is quite small. My belief is that these data are best viewed as hypothesis-gen- erating rather than practice-changing\" W here d o w e st and ?While we look for further answers regarding the consequences of hyperoxia, it is established that conservative oxygen therapy aimed at reducing delivered F/I.sc/o.sc 2 is a safe practice without any ad- verse outcomes. The conservative oxygen group in ICU-ROX allowed Sp/o.sc2 levels as low as 91% with no serious hypoxic events. On the other hand, the IOTA group in their data analysis sug- gested a possible increase in mortality risk, which was dose-dependent on the magnitude of in- crease in Sp/o.sc2, in the range of 94% to 96%. Based on the available evidence, it is reasonable to en- courage targeting lowest F/I.sc/o.sc2 values needed to maintain Sp/o.sc2 between 91% and 96% in our ICU patients. There would always be a small fraction of patients, such as those with ARDS or severe hypoxic respiratory failure, in whom this may not be achievable given fluctuating and unreliable Sp/o.sc2 levels in the setting of profound hypoxia. W hat lies ahead ? As the debate rages on, in an effort to answer this question for once and for all, the researchers of ICU-ROX are planning to conduct a mul- tinational, multicenter RCT, the MEGA-ROX. An ICU trial of this size has not been attempted before and, given the sample size, Dr. You n g feels the MEGA-ROX will be powered to detect an absolute mortality difference as low as 1.5%, if it does exist. There is a distinct possibility that conservative oxygen therapy will be best for pa- tients with some diagnoses while liberal oxygen will be best for patients with other diagnoses. \"We are conducting a number of parallel nested trials within the overall 40,000 participant trial sample. Each of these nested trials will evaluate a prespecified hypothesis in a specific cohort of critically ill patients and is accompanied by an appropriate power calculation. This will be able to address any heterogeneity of treatment effect among the different subgroups, \" he concluded. As we eagerly await the results of MEGA-ROX, there may be a growing belief among intensivists that when it comes to oxygen in the ICU, less may be truly more.

SAL A, MD; AND RADE TOMIC, MD, FCCP Lung transplants are increasing, with 2,562 performed in the United States in 2018 - a 31% increase over the preceding 5 years. With this increased demand for donor lungs, waitlist mortality in the United States is 9.4 deaths per 100 waitlist-years for obstructive lung diseases and as high as 29.7 deaths per 100 wait- list-years for restrictive lung diseases (Valapour M, et al. Lung. Am J Transplant. 2020;20[suppl s1]:427). Conversely, lungs are utilized from eligible multiorgan donors only 15% to 20% of the time, usually due to concerns over do- nor history or organ quality (Y oung KA, et al. Chest . 2019;155[3]:465). In light of this imbalance of supply and demand, lung transplant spe- cialists are making significant efforts to expand the donor pool of available organs. Three of these strategies include: (1) applications of ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) technology; (2) for hep C-negative recip- ients; and increasing utilization of donation after cardiac death. Normothermic ex-vivo lung perfusion is a technology that allows donor lungs to be per- fused and ventilated after removal from the donor but before transplant into the recipient. This is in contrast to the traditional method of cold static preservation. The proposed advan- tage of using this technology is to allow time for a more thorough assessment of graft quality and to improve function of grafts not meeting established criteria for transplant, all-the-while decreasing organ ischemia despite an increased cross-clamp time. There are currently four commercial systems available capable of EVLP . Broadly speaking, three EVLP management pro- tocols exist (Toronto, Lund, and OCS), which differ in perfusate composition, target flow, pulmonary arterial pressure, left atrial pressure, and ventilatory settings. Notably, the Toronto protocol uses a closed left atrium, whereas the Lund and OCS protocol use an open left atrium. There are excellent published reviews of the different systems (Possoz J, et al. J Thorac Dis. 2019;11[4]:1635). EVLP has now been studied for two different goals: (1) to allow an extended evaluation of l ungs of questionable quality be- fore transplant; or (2) for routine use in all lung transplantations in place of cold static preserva- tion. In most studies concerning the use of EVLP for reconditioning of donor lungs, \"high risk\" or \"extended criteria\" refers to one or more of the following: P/F ratios < 300 on arterial blood gas, macroscopic abnormalities (eg, pulmonary ede- ma, poor lung compliance), donation after circu- latory death, or high-risk history (eg, aspiration). The largest cohort with the longest follow-up addressing the role of EVLP for donation of lungs with extended criteria was published from the Toronto Lung Transplant Group. Their results have demonstrated equivalent graft survival and rates of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) up to 9 years posttransplant compared with standard criteria donor lungs, despite utiliz- ing lower quality lungs and having a longer me- dian preservation (Divithotawela C, et al. JAMA Surg. 2019;154[12]:1143). The group's subsequent lung transplant rates have increased over the past decade. A separate study addressed the same question but differed in that it was a single-arm, multicenter, international trial that tracked the outcomes of 93 extended criteria lungs placed on EVLP (including a large proportion acquired via donation after circulatory death) (Loor G, et al. Lancet Respir Med . 2019;7[11]:975). Among these, 87% of eligible lungs were trans- planted, and outcomes were excellent, albeit short- er in follow-up compared with the Toronto cohort (eg, primary graft dysfunction grade 3 (PGD3) within 72 hours was 44% and 1-year survival was 91%). Based on these trials and many other retro- spective reports, it has been concluded by many experts in the field that EVLP-treated extended criteria donor lungs perform equally well to stan- dard criteria donor lungs. Two RCTs have been conducted to evaluate whether EVLP is noninferior to static cold stor- age with donor lungs meeting \"standard crite- ria\" for transplant. The first was a single center study at the Medical University of Vienna, that looked at 80 recipient/donor pairs. Lungs in the EVLP arm underwent 4 hours of perfusion with frequent reassessment of quality before trans- plant, whereas the lungs in the control arm went dir ectly to transplant. This study met noninfe- riority criteria looking at primary outcomes of PGD grade >1 and 30-day survival (Slama A, et al. J Heart Lung Transplant. 2017;36[7]:744). The second study was a phase 3, multicenter, inter- national trial that included 320 recipient/donor pairs randomized to either EVLP (without a pre- specified time on the EVLP system) or static cold storage. This trial met noninferiority for safety endpoints (lung graft-related adverse events with- in 30 days) and a composite primary outcome of PGD grade 3 incidence within 72 hours and 30-day survival (Warnecke G, et al. Lancet Respir Med. 2018;6[5]:357). The authors also tested and found superiority of EVLP in lower PGD grade 3 frequency compared with control. While these RCTs may suggest a role for EVLP in the pro- curement process of standard criteria organs in addition to extended criteria organs in the future, major criticisms for these trials include the lack of a demonstrable clinical benefit over cold stor- age beyond the lower PGD3 rates.In the era of direct-acting antiviral agents available to treat HCV infection, there have been efforts to study the early use of anti-HCV med- ications to prevent infection as a result of heart or lung transplant from HCV viremic donors to HCV-negative recipients. In one major trial on efficacy, it was found that 4 weeks of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir, when started within a few hours of transplant, was sufficient to achieve a sustained (undetectable) virologic response at 12 weeks after completion of the antiviral regimen (Wool- ley AE, et al. N Engl J Med. 2019;380[17]:1606). Therefore, many transplant centers have adopted protocols to increase the donor pool (by CDC estimates about 4% of solid organ donors are HCV-positive) by accepting HCV nucleic acid amplification test (NAT)-positive donors for HCV-negative recipients, after appropriate in- formed consent. Donation after cardiac death (DCD), which is alternatively known as donation after circula- tory determination of death (DCDD), generally refers to organ procurement taking place after cessation of circulation, often after inpatient withdrawal of support. This is in contrast to the much more common practice of donation after brain death (DBD). Addressing concerns over the quality of l ungs donated in the context of DCD compared with DBD, analyses of ISHLT registry data have demonstrated no differences in hospi- tal length of stay or survival at 1 or 5 years (Van Raemdonck D, et al. J Heart Lung Transplant. 2019;38[12]:1235). Outcomes comparing specific mechanisms of donor death in DCD remain rel- atively unknown, such as outcomes from donors withdrawn from life support vs donors who had an uncontrolled cardiac death. These methods for expanding the donor pool are not mutually exclusive, and, in fact, applica- tion of EVLP for lungs obtained in the context of DCD seems to be increasingly common. Optimi- zation of protocols with collaboration between lung transplant centers will be paramount as we move forward in advancing this field. As we do so, efforts to successfully increase the donor pool will serve to provide a life-saving therapy to an ever-growing number of patients with end-stage lung disease.

Occu p at ional and E nv ironm ent al H ealt hSevere silicosis in engineered stone fabrication workers: An emerging epidemic Silicosis is an irreversible fibrotic lung disease caused by inhalation of respirable forms of crystalline silica. Silica exposure is also asso- ciated with increased risk for my- cobacterial infections, lung cancer, emphysema, autoimmune diseases, and kidney disease (Leung CC, et al. Lancet . 2012;379[9830]:2008; Bang KM, et al. MMWR. 2015;64[5]:117). Engineered stone is a manufactured quartz-based composite increasingly used for countertops in the United States where imports of engineered stone for this use have increased around 800% from 2010 to 2018. With this, reported silicosis cases among engineered stone fabrication workers have risen. Silica content in different stones varies from up to 45% in natural stones (granite) to >90% in engineered stone and quartz. The act of cutting, grinding, sanding, drilling, polishing, and installing this stone puts workers with direct and indirect contact with these tasks at risk for hazardous lev- els of inhaled silica exposure (OSHA et al. https://www.osha.gov/Publica- tions/OSHA3768.pdf. 2015). A growing number of cases asso- ciated with stone fabrication have been reported worldwide (Kramer MR, et al. Chest . 2012;142[2]:419; Kirby T. Lancet . 2019;393:861). The CDC recently published a report of 18 cases of accelerated silicosis over a 2-year period among engi- neered stone fabrication workers. The majority of patients were aged <50 years, five patients had auto- immune disease, two patients had latent TB, and two died (Rose C, et al. MMWR. 2019;68[38]:813). Thus, the experience of engineered stone fabrication workers appears to parallel that of patients exposed to silica in other occupations. Control measures (see resources below) for silica exposure, pre- vention, and medical surveillance have been updated since 2016 at the federal level prompting a re- cent revision of O S HA's National Emphasis Program for respirable crystalline silica as of February 2020 (OSHA, https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/trade/02052020, published February 5, 2020). De- spite these measures, enforcement within the stone fabrication industry remains challenging. Small-scale o perations with limited expertise in exposure control combined with high density of immigrant workers with limited health-care access and potential threat of retaliation have limited compliance with updated standards (Rose C, et al. MMWR. 2019;68[38]:813). Silicosis is preventable, and efforts to minimize workplace exposure and enhance medical surveillance of stone fabrication workers should be prioritized.

And, as a new grad, one of the biggest lessons I have learned so far is to speak up. Whether it is during rounds, a code situation, or just conversations with the team. I owe it to my patients to advocate for their care and provide the expertise that I bring to the team. To the doctor or nurse, I hope you will give me that opportunity to help care for our patients; to learn; and even teach, to improve that care.

While weight loss in obese patients with sleep apnea is an effective treat- ment strategy, researchers honed in on a particular site of impact - the tongue fat (Wang SH, et al. Am J Re- spir Crit Care Med. 2020;201[6]:718). After a weight loss program, they studied the changes in the tongue, pterygoid, lateral pharyngeal wall, and abdominal fat volumes using MRI. It turned out that reduced tongue fat volume was the primary mediator associated with AHI im- provement. The authors suggested a reduction in tongue fat volume may be a potential OSA treatment strat- egy. Future studies will tell whether this is feasible and effective. Recently, the FDA approved a new medication to treat residual daytime sleepiness in patients with sleep apnea - solriamfetol. Like other wake-promoting agents, it acts on the central nervous system and im-NEWS FROM CHEST P alliat iv e and E nd - of- L ife C are Building primary palliative care competencies in the CHEST com-munity The CHEST community cares for many patients with serious illness- es characterized by a high risk of mortality, burdensome symptoms or treatments, and caregiver distress, which negatively impact quality of life (QOL) (Kelly, et al. J Palliat Med . 2018;21[S2]:S7). Specialist palliative care (PC) clinicians work in partnership with other specialties to optimize QOL and alleviate suf- fering for seriously ill patients (ie, advanced or chronic respiratory dis- ease and/or critical illness). Referral for specialist PC integra- tion should be based on the complex needs of patients and not prognosis. PC can and should be delivered alongside disease-directed and life-prolonging therapies. Early PC referral in serious illness has been as- sociated with improved QOL, better prognostic awareness, and, in some instances, increased survival. Addi-tionally, reductions in medical costs at the end-of-life have been observed with early PC integration (Parikh, et al. N Engl J Med . 2013;369[24]:2347). However, patients with chronic or advanced respiratory diseases often receive PC late, if at all (Brown, et al. Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2016;13[5]:684). This might be explained by sig- nificant shortages within the PC workforce, misconceptions that PC is only delivered at the end of life, and limited proficiency or comfort in primary PC delivery. Primary PC competencies have already been defined for pulmonary and critical care clinicians (Lanken, et al. Am J Respir Crit Care Med . 2008;177:912). The Palliative and End-of-Life Care NetWork is focused on promoting awareness of specialty PC while pro- viding education and resources to support primary PC competencies within the CHEST community.

L AMB ERTI, MD, FCCP On Thursday, March 12, the American College of Chest Phy- sicians (CHEST) and the National Association for Medical Direction of Respiratory Care (NAMDRC) an- nounced publicly our official intent to come together as one association, integrating all NAMDRC activities and operations into CHEST. This integration launch followed months of discussion between CHEST and NAMDRC leadership. Our respective Boards agreed that united efforts will amplify our individual involvement in patient advocacy and policy. CHEST and NAMDRC have an intertwined purpose of delivering the highest standard of care for our patients. For this reason, our likeminded advocacy agendas can be even better fulfilled when we can leverage strengths from both associations. CHEST and NAMDRC have shared an overlapping member- ship and collaborative history of empowering patients through the advancement of public policy and clinical education for decades. In additional to our individual efforts, our associations historically lev- eraged a com-bined advocacy presence in Washington DC to advance legislation against major tobacco corpo-rations. Coming together as a joint advoca- cy-focused organization, the initia- tion of CHEST's Health Policy and Advocacy Committee, which will be comprised of an equal selection of CHEST and NAMDRC leader- ship, will drive CHEST's advocacy agenda.

Inspired by Shark Tank, our kinder, gen- tler, yet still competitive and cut- ting-edge FISH Bowl (Furthering Innovation and Science for Health) featured CHEST mem- bers disrupting our beliefs about how clinical care and ed- ucation are performed. As health- care pro- viders, they presented in- novative ideas pertaining to education and clinical dis- ease for pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine. Six finalists were chosen from dozens of sub- missions, and three emerged win- ners. In this new Meet the FISH Bowl Finalists series, CHEST introduces you to many of them - including Education Category Finalist Dr. Cota. Name: Donna Cota, PGY5 Crit- ical Care Position: 2nd Ye ar Fellow in PGY5 Critical Care Title: Time to Vent: A Blended Learning Experience Brief Summary of Submis- sion: Time to Vent is a blended learning experience focused on ventilator management that incorporates modalities for all learning types. It includes a hand- out, audio/visual presentation, and practice case scenarios. 1. What inspired your innova- tion? I remembered that as a res- ident, I had a very difficult time understanding ventilators and worked hard to try to understand them on my own. When I started fellowship, I thought I under- stood ventilator management and then realized I was still wrong. I have focused my training on education, and I wanted to create a concise resource geared toward the fundamentals of ventilators for the benefit of educational levels. 2. Who do you think can benefit most from it, and why? Right now, I have focused the project on teaching residents of varying specialties, such as in- ternal medicine and emergency medicine. They are still in train- ing and rotate through ICUs, needing to understand ventilators for effective patient care and questions are present on their board examinations. 3. What do you see as chal- lenges to your innovation gain- ing widespread acceptance? How can they be overcome? The biggest challenge is making the w ebsite able to be found on Goo- gle. This is a work in progress. However, right now, the link is sent via email to interested par- ties. 4. Why was it meaningful for you to emerge as a finalist in FISH Bowl 2019? It built con- fidence that my lifelong project is important and has merit to it. And, it ended up becoming a way for people to learn about the project and ask me for the link. 5. What future do you envi- sion for your innovation beyond FISH Bowl 2019? I am still go- ing to continue to improve the project with current endeavors to include a piece on waveforms and dyssynchrony of the ventilator. My ultimate goal is to create a free virtual ventilator simulator with practice cases. proves the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. We look forward to head-to-head studies with current agents (modafinil or armodafinil). Though not entirely new, two de- vices have been gaining popularity for sleep apnea treatment. Both are nerve stimulators: one designed for obstruc- tive sleep apnea, is a hypoglossal nerve stimulator; the other, a treatment for central sleep apnea, is a phrenic nerve stimulator. They are slowly gaining popularity, though their invasive na- ture, patient selection criteria, and cost may limit their widespread adaption. More importantly, data on long-term outcomes and impact on hard end- points such as mortality and reduction in cardiovascular morbidity are sparse.

Pembrolizumab is approved in ad- vanced NSCLC with 50% PD-L1 expression based on KEYNOTE-024 trial.1 Recent updated analysis of KEY- NOTE 024 trial2 showed that patients with advanced NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab had a median OS of 30.0 months compared with 14.2 months for those treated with che- motherapy. More recently, 5-year out- comes of KEYNOTE-001 trial3 showed that OS was 23.2% for treatment-naive patients and 15.5% for previously treat- ed patients with no grade 4 or 5 treat- ment-related adverse events. Nivolumab is approved for the treat- ment of patients with advanced NSCLC with progression of disease after stan- dard chemotherapy (regardless of PD-L1 expression) based on CHECKMATE 017/057 trials.4,5 OS at 5 years in recently presented pooled analysis of these trials was 13.4% in nivolumab arm compared with 2.6% in docetaxel arm with a PFS of 8% and 0%, respectively.6,7 Median duration of response was 19.9 months vs 5.6 months. At 5 years, almost one- third of patients who responded to the nivolumab were without disease progres- sion. Similarly, a recent 5-year analysis of patients with advanced NSCLC treated with nivolumab showed OS of 16%, and nonsqua- histology; 75% survivors disease progression.8 Treatment with immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC has resulted in a dra- matic change in outcomes with a small percentage of patients able to achieve durable responses.
