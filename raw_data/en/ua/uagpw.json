J. Janick and A. Whipkey (eds.). ASHS Press, Alexandria, V A. Chinese Medicinal Herbs: Opportunities for Domestic Production* Lyle E. Craker and Jean Giblette During the past three decades, traditional Chinese medicine, based primarily on plant materials, has been adopted throughout the much of the Western world and become one of the fastest-growing healthcare choicesin the United States (P. Darrin, pers. commun.). Evidence of growth in the practice of Chinese medicine isprobably best illustrated by the increase in number of licensed Chinese medicine providers in the US, from5,525 in 1992, to 14,228 today (B. Mitchell, pers. commun.). This increase in traditional Chinese medicinepractitioners has increased the demand for medicinal plant material. Yet, practically all of the plant material(cultivated or wildcrafted) used in the practice of traditional Chinese medicine in the US is imported fromChina (P. Darrin, pers. commun.). Since many of the imported Chinese medicinal plant species are producedin environments similar to environments in the US, the possibility of domestic production of these plants forthe US Chinese medicinal market exists. Domestic production of these botanicals would help insure the safety,freshness, and quality of the material. Although the earliest practitioners of Chinese medicine in the US (many of whom were medical doctors) tended to use only acupuncture, Westerners have come to understand that dietary therapy, including the use ofherbs and other botanicals, is central to traditional Chinese medicine. In addition, the practice of traditionalChinese medicine is based on a philosophy (holistic) quite different than the practice of \"Western\" medicine(Tierra 1998; Zhu 1998). Traditional Chinese medicine defines health as body integrity, adaptability, continu-ity, and balance with the doctor prescribing traditional plant, animal, and mineral remedies to sustain a self-regulatory status in the body (a balance of yin and yang). This contrasts with Western medicine in whichhealth is defined as the absence of disease symptoms and the doctor diagnoses and prescribes clinically testedmedicines to eradicate disease symptoms. Because the majority of plant materials used in Traditional Chinesemedicine (amassed over 2000+ years through observations of patients by clinicians) have not been clinicallyevaluated in randomized, double-blind studies, Western medicine does not generally accept the efficacy orsafety of the treatment. The traditional paradigm of herbal usage in China incorporates three concepts that are relatively unfa- miliar to Americans, but which can influence the way herbs are produced, marketed, and used in the US: (1) anutritive approach in which foods are considered medicinal and some medicinal herbs are considered appro-priate for everyday consumption, (2) an understanding that processing techniques used to prepare medicinalplant fractions for consumption affect the energetics, chemistry, and efficacy of the product, and (3) a relianceon traditional formulations to achieve the desired therapeutic result. For traditional Chinese medical practi-tioners, no firm distinction between food and medicine exists (Yang 1998; Zhu 1998). Indeed, some Chinesemedicinal plants, such as those recognized as are already in nutraceutical products in the US, including herbal teas, soft drinks, soups, and trail mixes. Each of the many hundreds of medicinal plant fractions used in traditional Chinese medicine has an associated traditional processing procedure. According to the summary in Bensky and Gamble (1993), anEnglish translation of the Chinese Materia Medica widely used in the US, processing has a specific medicinal purposes, to increase the potency, to minimize side effects, and/or to alter medicinal properties for a particularclinical use. Processing includes such activities as pulverization, slicing, bleaching, soaking, dry-frying, roasting,steaming, and sun-drying. Processed medicinal plants are subsequently sold directly to herbal dispensaries orpractitioners that combine and administer herbs to patients or to manufacturers that combine the herbs into *Joint publication of the Laboratories for Natural Products, Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Univ.

Traditional practitioners in Chinese medicine are trained to give dietary advice, including recommenda- tions of seasonal foods and foods with energetic properties to restore metabolic balance to the patient. Herbsare prescribed only in formulas that follow traditional practice, although these may be modified slightly toaccommodate the individual needs of a patient. Formulas typically contain 8 to 15 different plant materials.Several American herbal product manufacturers, for example, Spring Wind, Nuherbs, and Golden Flower,supply the practitioner market with prepared traditional formulas made with imported herbs. Given the many possibilities among the approximately 5000 plant species used in traditional Chinese medicine (Zhong Yao Da Ci Dian 1977), the task of selecting plants for production in the Western nations issubstantial. Choices of plants should come from those with special appeal to practitioners (due to the fre-quency of use in traditional formulas) and from plants with appeal to a more general market (due to a per-ceived value as immune system stimulators, or adaptogens). For the traditional practitioner market, a systematicapproach for choosing potential crops would include: plant material that is fresher or of higher quality thanimported products (specifically aromatics and leaf crops), herbs that are expensive (due to over-harvesting orloss of habitat in China), and plant materials that are most often used in formulas. Plants with an appeal in thegeneral market would include those that boost the immune system, contain antioxidants, and fight the agingprocess. This report suggests eight Chinese medicinal plants that could be marketed in markets (Table 2). Table 1. Chinese medicinal plants suggested for sale to practitioners.

Hsiao, Fabaceae Common Chinese name Huang qi Common English name Astragalus or milk vetchAnnual/Perennial PerennialParts used Root (root of A. membranaceous and A. var. mongholicus of are used, in other Astragulus spp. the seeds are used) Drug name Radix AstragaliTraditional uses in Both the root and seed are classified as sweet and warm. The root is considered to Chinese medicine elevate the Qi and affects the lung and spleen channels, whereas the seed increases Yang and acts primarily on kidney and liver channels. Huang qi is present in a wide variety of formulas and is used in cooking to fortify soupstock. Active constituents Saponins, flavones, and polysaccharidesPropagation Propagated by seed or cutting. Seeds must be scarified or soaked in water, germination may be challenging Cultivation Astragalus is adaptable to a variety of growing conditions, a sandy, well-drained soil is preferred. Plant spacing 45-60 cm within rowsHarvest information Roots harvested after 3 to 5 yearsProcessing Dried roots are stir-fried with honey (1 part by weight to four parts root).Other comments Work is being done with other species of Astragalus that are used for their seed, such as sha yuan ji li , identified as Astragalus ginsengAnnual/Perennial PerennialParts used RootDrug name Radix shen is known as \"poor man's ginseng\" because medicinal properties of the Chinese medicine plant resemble those of the Asian species, Panax ginseng (ren shen ). Both dang shen and ren shen boost the Qi and have an affinity with the lung and spleen channels. American ginseng, Panax quinquefolius , is considered to have different properties: xi yang shen \"western seas root,\" nourishes the Yin and works through the heart, kidney and lung channels. This is a good example oftraditional medicine making clear distinctions between two closely relatedspecies, but recognizes close similarities across genus and family lines. Active constituents Contains phytosterols & triterpenesPropagation Propagated by seedCultivation Codonopsis is a climbing vine that grows well in part shade, plants must be provided with a trellis. Plant spacing 30 cm within rowsHarvest information Roots harvested after 3 yearsProcessing Roots are roasted with millet (5:1, root:millet).495Herbs, Medicinals, and Aromatics Lycium chinense Mill., Solanaceae Common Chinese name Go qi zi Common English name Wolfberry or matrimony vineAnnual/Perennial uses in Lycium yields two distinct medicinal portions. The fruits, go qi zi, are considered Chinese medicine sweet and neutral and to nourish the blood. The root bark, di gu pi , \"earth bone bark,\" is sweet and cold and cools the blood. Both portions of the plant haveaffinity for the liver, lung, and kidney channels. The fruit, which are dried likeraisins and sold in packages in Chinese supermarkets, have become part oftrendy trail mixes in the US.
