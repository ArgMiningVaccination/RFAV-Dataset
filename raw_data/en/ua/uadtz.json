Hi Emily, why did you decide to pursue a creative path? As a child I was always creating. I was raised with a ton of love and the idea that hard work got you all the things in life you could possibly want. We didn't have a lot growing up, I was raised by a single mother, and all areas of life were rationed. So if there was something I wished to have, I had to come up with the funds to get it on my own. The go getter in me at an early age found a way to sell my creations and magic potions to neighbors and such to afford the things I wanted. As time went on I found working with children and in the school systems to be the field of choice for me, but something was always missing. Working with kids afforded me the time and space to make art and create, but as time went on the broken school system and the lack of real change I felt I was able to make, left me wanting and needing more. I have always used art as a creative outlet, different forms and medias, especially in times of pain and struggle. Some years ago I found myself out of work due to chronic health issues, needing something to keep my mind off the terrible pain and unhappiness I was suffering from. Having recently finished my yoga certification, my path of healing myself and others had begun. With the help of yoga, meditation, crystal work and reiki, I was able to piece together what strength was left and wanted to find a way to share that with others. I've since added an adv. reiki certification and the amazing journey of medicinal herbs through The Colorado School Of Clinical Herbalism to my repertoire. My deep love and admiration for our Earth and all that She gives us to heal ourselves, & others is something that inspires me daily to create and share. Gypsy Rose Apothecary, has become a platform in which I can do just that. This little shop began with a dream and a cell phone and in the last few years has grown organically in a way I never could have imagined.I have made it my life's work to help heal our Earth. Using every opportunity to educate, enlighten and take whatever action I can to be sure She is well advocated for and taken care of. The idea to purse this life as a career really formed on its own by a need to heal and create for others. I would've never believed if you told me a few years ago, that creating and selling herbal products and sharing my light, love and magic with the world would be my business I probably would've laughed in your face. But the beauty of it all is that it is now, and even though the road has been rocky at times, there isn't anything else I could picture myself doing. and it can be that way for any of us really... With a dream, and belief in yourself, and a lot work hard work, anything is possible. Alright, so let's move onto what keeps you busy professionally? My art. Though it has changed over the years, today it is shared in the form of custom Herbal Apothecary products and Teas, Healing Salves, Mystical, Magickal, Cosmic Collections of Ritual, Chakra, Element Oils and Elixirs, Aura Cleansing and Smudging Products, Zodiac and Lunar Hydrosols, Rollers & more. I have taken the time to grow my business slowly and organically, in that I never wanted to loose that day to day interaction with customers. I pride myself on my ability to use my intuition to create personalized and meaningful products. Other retail outlets do not carry my creations, because I wish to keep the relationships I've made with clientele and help that to grow. It hasn't been easy, and I've had to work hard in other avenues to build the brand I wish to share. But it has always been so rewarding. When I hear from a customer about how perfect an item is for them, there's really nothing else in the world that fills my heart more. I just hope I can continue to grow from here. Create a platform where I can take my story and my products on the road and reach even more people. Use local herbs and supplies and sell locally as I travel, meet and experience all the beautiful life that is out there. If you had a friend visiting you, what are some of the local spots you'd want to take them around to? Well I live in the Mountains in Colorado, so adventure out here is everywhere! We would for sure need to head to Red Rocks and check out the live music on tap! There aren't very many places as magical a place as Red Rocks. Exploring, hiking and camping in and around Grand Lake is a must and tacos are always on the menu. You really can't go wrong with any Taco joint from here to Denver and beyond!
