These are just three of the ways Andrea integrates Ayurveda into her day. And those lucky enough to attend her workshop in Perth, WA on Sunday, March 21, will discover many more tips and ways they can stay strong and healthy this Autumn and beyond. Andrea, a mum of one, developed a close connection with nature while growing up in the English countryside. Her family emigrated to South Africa in the early 70's where she was educated. Finding out about the \"spice route\" around the Cape to India and the Spice Islands captured her imagination. Historically black pepper was more valuable than gold! Andrea's interest in Ayurveda was sparked when she first travelled to India in her 20s. After completing her Diploma of Yoga Teaching with the IYTA in 2001, she began reading more about Ayurveda (Wisdom of Life) - Yoga's sister science and decided to undertake a Diploma in Ayurvedic Lifestyle Counselling with the College of Mind, Body and Soul in Adelaide. During her two years of part-time study, Andrea explored the concept of staying in balance and disease prevention. She is particularly fascinated by the doshas and dravyagunavijnana (the qualities of substances in the natural world and how they affect us physically, mentally and emotionally). Also of special interest; the healing power of herbs and spices. Applying this essential knowledge now gives Andrea tools on a day to day basis to stay in balance through the seasons and her life cycle. So what's Andrea's morning schedule like? 6am - I start the day with time in the garden connecting with nature and practicing Mindfulness 6.15am- I then brew a cup of Ayurvedic Tea (recipe to be revealed at the workshop) 6.30am - while the tea is brewing I enjoy an Ayurvedic self massage (Abhyanga), using warmed black sesame oil and focus on the joints. I leave the oil to be absorbed whilst at 7am - sip tea while contemplating the day and cultivating gratitude. Before showering and ready for yoga. Andrea adds: \"My dominant dosha is Pitta and my secondary dosha is Kapha, so I am very mindful of the foods I eat and combine. I eat seasonally and in summer enjoy foods and acitivities that are cooling. Being in my 60's now, I am in the vata phase of life. Vata is responsible for anxiety and overwhelm and I understand and help my students manage stress. I make and blend a variety of herbal and spice mixes, to relieve stress, aid inflammation and help the digestive system through sparking Agni (digestive fire). I also enjoy a daily dose of golden paste (a combination of turmeric, black pepper and coconut oil) for inflammation and a cognitive boost, either in black coffee in the morning or milk in the evening.\" Andrea teaches seven yoga classes a week and offers Abhyanga massages (Ayurvedic full body massages), Indian Head Massage, Ayurvedic Lifestyle consultations and makes many herbal formulations as well as running monthly workshops at her home studio, The Santosha Room. The 2.5 hour IYTA workshop on Sunday, March 21 will feature: The seven steps to boost immunity as suggested by the AYUSH Ministry of India which was issued at the onset of the Corona Virus. Pic "}
