Gives a rough measure of the number of functioning nephrons Normal GFR: Men: 130 mL/min./1.73m2 Women: 120 mL/min./1.73m2 Cannot be measured directly, so we use creatinine and creatinine clearance to estimate.Assessment of Renal Function (cont.) Creatinine A naturally occurring amino acid, predominately found in skeletal muscle Freely filtered in the glomerulus, excreted by the kidney and readily measured in the plasma As plasma creatinine increases, the GFR exponentially decreases. Limitations to estimate GFR: Patients with decrease in muscle mass, liver disease, malnutrition, advanced age, may have low/normal creatinine despite underlying kidney disease 15-20% of creatinine in the bloodstream is not filtered in glomerulus, but secreted by renal tubules (giving overestimation may (Bactrim) CimetidineAssessment of Renal Function (cont.) way to estimate GFR GFR = (creatinine clearance) x (body surface area in m2/1.73) Ways to measure: 24-hour urine creatinine: Limitations: Based on white men with non- diabetes kidney disease Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Equation: GFR (mL/min./1.73m2) = 186 X (SCr) X (0.742 if female) X (1.210 if African -American )Major causes of Kidney Failure Prerenal Disease Vascular Disease Glomerular Disease Thromboembolic Chronic Benign hypertensive nephrosclerosis Intimal thickening and luminal narrowing of the large and small renal arteries and the glomerular arterioles usually due to hypertension. Most common in African Americans Treatment: Hypertension control Bilateral renal artery stenosis should be suspected in patients with acute, severe, or refractory hypertension who also have otherwise unexplained renal insufficiency Treatment: Medical therapy, surgery, stents.Glomerular Disease Nephritis Inflammation seen on histologic exam Active sediment: Red cells, white cells, granular casts, red cell casts Variable degree of proteinuria (< 3g/day) Nephrotic No inflammation Bland lupus erythematosus nephropathy C, Hep. Malignancy (usually of GI tract or lung) GVHD s/p renal transplant Mesangial proliferative diseaseInterstitial/Tubular Disease Acute: Acute Tubular Necrosis: One of the most causes of acute renal failure in hospitalized patients Causes: Hypotension, eosinophils (but not always present), white blood cells, red blood cells, white cell casts Cast Nephropathy -Multiple Myeloma Tubular casts -PAS-negative, and PAS -positive Cast nephropathy -Multiple myeloma tubular casts Interstitial Tubular Hypercalcemia Autoimmune disorders Sarcoidosis Sj\u00f6gren's syndromeObstructive Uropathy Obstruction of the urinary flow anywhere from the renal pelvis to the urethra Can be acute or chronic Most commonly caused by tumor or prostatic enlargement (hyperplasia or malignancy) Need to have bilateral obstruction in order to have renal insufficiencyChronic Kidney Disease = a GFR of < 60 for 3 months or more. Most common causes: Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension Management: Blood pressure control! Diabetic control! Smoking cessation Dietary protein restriction Phosphorus lowering drugs/ Calcium replacement Most patients have some degree of hyperparathyroidism Erythropoietin replacement Start when Hgb < 10 g/dL Bicarbonate therapy for acidosis Dialysis?Stages of Chronic Kidney Disease Stage Description GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) 1 Kidney damage with normal or increased GFR 90 2 Kidney damage with mildly decreased GFR60-89 3 Moderately decreased GFR 30-59 4 Severely decreased GFR 15-29 5 Kidney Failure < 15Acute Renal Failure An abrupt decrease in renal function sufficient to cause retention of metabolic waste such as urea and creatinine. Frequently have: Metabolic acidosis Hyperkalemia Disturbance in body fluid homeostasis Secondary effects on other organ systemsAcute Renal Failure Most community acquired acute renal failure (70%) is prerenal Most hospital acquired acute renal failure (60%) is due to ischemia or nephrotoxic tubular epithelial injury ( acute tubular necrosis). Mortality rate 50 -70%Advanced age Preexisting renal parenchymal disease Diabetes mellitus Underlying cardiac or liver diseaseRisk factor for acute renal failureUrine Output in Acute Renal failure Oliguria = daily urine output < 400 mL When present in acute renal failure, associated with a mortality rate of 75% (versus 25% mortality rate in non-oliguric patients) Most deaths are associated with the underlying disease process and infectious complications Anuria No urine production Uh-oh, probably time for dialysisMost common causes of ACUTE Renal Failure Prerenal Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) Acute on chronic renal failure (usually due to ATN or prerenal) Obstructive uropathy Glomerulonephritis/Vasculitis Acute Interstitial nephritis Cancers? Polycystic kidney meds? Any recent antibiotic use? Any NSAID use?Assessing the patient with acute renal failure -- Radiology Renal Ultrasound Look for signs of hydronephrosis as sign of obstructive uropathy.Assessing the patient with acute renal failure - Urinalysis Hematuria Non- glomerular: Urinary sediment: Glomerular: Atheroembolic disease TTP/HUS (thombotic Renal Failure - Urinalysis (cont.) Protein Need microscopic urinalysis to see microabluminemia Can check 24-hour urine protein collection Nephrotic syndrome - 3.5 g protein in 24 hours Albuminuria Atheroembolic disease (TTP/HUS) Thrombotic microangiopathy Nephrotic epithelial injury (acute tubular necrosis) Interstitial nephritisAssessing patient with acute renal failure - Urinary Casts Red cell casts Glomerulonephritis Vasculitis White Cell casts Acute Interstitial nephritis Fatty casts Nephrotic syndrome, Minimal change disease Muddy Brown casts Acute tubular necrosis Assessing patient with acute renal failure - Renal Biopsy If unable to discover cause of renal disease, renal biopsy may be warranted. Renal biopsy frequently performed in patient's with history of renal transplant with worsening renal function.Treatment of Acute Renal Failure Treat underlying cause Blood pressure Infections Stop inciting medications Nephrostomy tubes/ureteral stents if obstruction Treat scleroderma renal Diuresis TransplantIndications Hyperkalemia (plasma potassium concentration >6.5 meq/L) or rapidly rising potassium levels Metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.1) Azotemia (BUN greater than 80 to 100 mg/dL [29 to 36 mmol/L]) Signs of uremia, such as pericarditis, neuropathy, or an otherwise unexplained decline in mental status Severe dysnatremias (sodium concentration greater than 155 meq/L or less than 120 meq/L) Hyperthermia Overdose with a dialyzable drug/toxin Question # 1 A 82-year old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia presents from her nursing home with diarrhea for three days. Per nursing home documents, there have been multiple recent outbreaks of C. difficile colitis among their 96, 16, 98% on RA Gen.: Slightly lethargic, oriented to self only; in NAD est: noneQuestion # 1 (cont.) What further information would be helpful in evaluating this patient? What are some possible diagnoses in this patient? What further studies would you like to do? What might you see in urinary sediment?Question # 1 (cont.) Urine sodium = 40 mg/dL Urine creatinine = 140 mg/dL Renal ultrasound: no sign of hydronephrosisQuestion # 1 (cont.) What kind of renal failure do you think this patient has? How would you treat this patient?Question #2 A 75-year old woman is admitted to the hospital for confusion. The patient is oriented to person but not time or place. She has a history of cervical cancer, treated with total hysterectomy and radiation 18 months ago. Previous evaluation in her private physician's office 3 months ago showed her serum creatinine concentration was 1.0 mg/dL.Question #2 (cont.) Physical examination shows a temperature of 36.2\u00b0 C, a regular pulse rate of 98/min., a regular respiration rate of 20/min., and a blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg. There is no orthostasis. There is no neck vein distention at 45 degrees, and the chest is clear. S1 and S2 are normal, without gallop or murmur. Liver span is 18 cm, and the edge is three finger breadths below the right costal margin. The spleen tip is palpable before the left costal margin. There is shifting dullness and bowel sounds are present. There is 2+ pedal edema. Cranial nerves and reflexes are normal, and the neurologic examination did not elicit focal findings.Question Blood: negative Ketones: negative Microscopic: 0 to 1 RBC per high- power field 0 to 1 WBC /hpf No cellular # 2 (cont.) The most appropriate initial step in the clinical management of this patient is: (A)Renal ultrasound (B)Renal Biopsy (C)A trial of (D)Continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration (E)Renal scintigraphyQuestion # 3 A 45-year old male with a history of metastatic colon cancer is admitted to the hospital for pain control. Patient has known metastases to the spine and pelvis, and has had worsening pain over the last several weeks. Palliative care is consulted and helps with pain control. However, his hospitalization is complicated by nosocomial pneumonia. He underwent a staging CT on Hospital #6, which showed a mild increase in size of spinal, pelvic mets. On hospital day #8, his daily chemistry shows an increase in his creatinine from 1.0 the day before to 1.9. Question # 3 (cont.) PMH: Colon cancer (diagnosed 4 years ago, s/p partial colectomy, chemo., radiation; known mets to liver, #3 What are some possible causes of renal failure in this patient? What would you do the urine sediment shows muddy brown casts? What would you suspect if urine eosinophils are seen?The above slides were selected from presentations found online The following slides are selected from a presentation found online Diuretics and in Acute Kidney Injury Asad J. Chaudhary M.D. Clinical Nephrology Fellow University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Etiology of AKI AKIClassification of AKI: Non Oliguria: -Urine ml/24 hr Anuria: 50 ml/24 of nitrogenous waste Uremia: -Symptomatic AKI (eg MS changes, loss of appetite, tremors)Oliguria is a well -recognized and poor prognostic indicator in patients with AKI. The development of oliguria complicates clinical management, particularly for fluid balance. Use of diuretics therefore reflects attempt to convert oliguric state to non -oliguric state.

(Continued) Monitor eGFR and UACR Treat cardiovascular risk, especially with smokers and hypercholesterolemia Screen for anemia (Hgb), malnutrition (albumin), metabolic bone disease (Ca, Phos, PTH) Refer to dietitian for nutritional guidance Consult or team with a nephrologist Encourage labs to report estimated eGFR and urine albumin/creatinine ratiosNephrology referral suggestions To assist with diagnostic challenge (e.g. decision to biopsy) To assist with therapeutic challenge (e.g. blood pressure) Rapid decay of estimated GFR Most primary kidney diseases, (e.g. glomerulonephridites) Preparation for renal replacement therapy, especially when GFR less than 30Nephrology referral suggestions, cont. Regardless of when you refer: Obtaining preliminary evaluation (e.g. ultrasound, screening serologies) Providing consultant with patient history including serial measures of renal functionPrimary care providers - First line of defense against CKD Primary care professionals can play a significant role in early diagnosis, treatment, and patient education Therapeutic interventions for diabetic CKD are similar to those required for optimal diabetes care Control of glucose, blood pressure, and lipids A greater emphasis on detecting CKD, and managing it prior to referral, can improve patient outcomes CKD is Part of Primary CareReferences Anavekar NS, Leimberger JD, Califf RM, Pfeffer MA.
