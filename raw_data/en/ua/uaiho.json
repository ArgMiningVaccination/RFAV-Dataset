While several reports in the literature highlight different aspects of T&CM including clinical practice, research, education and regulation globally, recent comprehensive reviews on the current status of T&CM in Australia are limited. Therefore, this review was designed to critically analyze the literature on the present status of T&CM modalities including Traditional Chinese Medicine, chiropractic, naturopathy and Ayurveda in Australia and comprehensively summarize the key studies from an Australian perspective. Several key gaps in the evidence-based clinical practice (e.g., lack of patient-focused approach and communication between patients and health professionals), research (e.g., methodological flaws/inconsistencies, limited government funding, collaborative research, facilities, capability, and resources), education (e.g., lack of uniform minimum standard of education and limited courses) and regulation (e.g., self-regulated naturopathy) of T&CM in Australia were identified through this review. Furthermore, studies in the literature underlined that some T&CM modalities including naturopathy and Ayurveda require statutory and updated regulations, formal registration and proper training and education. A patient-focused approach in clinical practice and the generation of evidence through collaborative research (establishment of more practice-based research networks) among universities, T&CM industry and practitioners and more support from the government to conduct research and improve training and education are imperative for effective evidence-based practice of T&CM in Australia....", "sitename": "LWW", "date": "2023-06-29", "cleaned_text": "INTRODUCTION According to the World Health Organization (WHO) global report on traditional and complementary medicine 2019, the terms \"complementary medicine\" and \"alternative medicine\" refer to a wider scope of health-care practices which are neither a part of the country's own traditional/conventional medicine nor fully integrated to the country's dominant health-care system.[ [1]] In some countries, these practices are used interchangeably with traditional medicine.[ [1]] However, traditional medicine holds explicable or inexplicable facts in terms of the sum of knowledge, theories-based skills and practices, culture-specific beliefs, and experiences.[ [1]] Traditional medicine is used to maintain health, including the prevention, diagnosis, improvement, or treatment of numerous physical and mental ailments.[ [1]] The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), Department of Health, Australia, considers vitamin, mineral, herbal, aromatherapy, and homoeopathic products as complementary medicines and are regulated as medicines under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989.[ [2]] The TGA defines complementary medicine as a therapeutic good comprising primarily of one or more designated active ingredients (mentioned in Schedule 14 of the Regulations), each of which has a clearly established identity and traditional use.[ [2]] Depending on ingredients and claims made for the medicines, complementary medicines can either be listed or registered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).[ [3]] Globally, 9.8%-76% general population use traditional and complementary medicines (T&CM) to treat illnesses, maintain well-being, and as integrative treatment with conventional medicine.[ [4]] In Australia, about 68.9% of the general population were reported to use T&CM at least one form of in the previous 12 months to benefit health, prevent diseases, and as nutritional supplements in a nation-wide study in 2005.[ [5] [6]] Although there have been several reports on the clinical practice, education, research, and regulation of T&CM globally, recent comprehensive reviews from an Australian perspective on T&CM are limited. Therefore, this review was designed to critically analyze the current literature particularly focused on the current status of T&CM in Australia and comprehensively summarize the key studies in an Australian context. CLINICAL PRACTICE OF TRADITIONAL AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINES IN AUSTRALIA Key modalities Traditional Chinese Medicine The use of and demand for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) within Australia has been steadily increasing since the late 20th century.[ [7]] As TCM is recognized as part of its health-care system in Australia, TCM practitioners are required to complete a clinical practice educational program recognized by the Australian Ministry of Health.[ [8]] One study conducted a national survey of TCM registered practitioners and professional association members within Australia and reported that acupuncture was the most applied (93%) TCM modality used by practitioners in their clinics.[ [9]] In addition, the study found that a substantial number of TCM practitioners utilized a combined approach of acupuncture techniques and Chinese herbal medicine.[ [9]] A more recent survey, which was specifically administered to acupuncture practitioners with a primary focus on addressing women's health, reported that there was a dissociation between the design of TCM research and clinical practice, with a specific lack of individualization in treatment plans.[ [10]] This disconnect was also reported in an earlier review that emphasized the large share of research funding for TCM within Australia is designated to laboratory-based and clinical trial research, which does not directly inform clinical practice.[ [11]] Furthermore, while TCM is a registered and regulated in Australia, the profession continues to evolve, and policy development must remain up to date to ensure full compliance to ensure public safety. Chiropractic The chiropractic profession is a common health-care profession in Australia. Although the scope of this practice has been debated by members of the profession and other professional bodies, chiropractic has been defined by the WHO as a profession that manages and treats the musculoskeletal system, as well as the effect it has on the patient's general health and nervous system function.[ [12]] A significant number of chiropractic patients are of older age, and a study on Australian chiropractic patients identified that 56% of older patients presented with a back problem at the chiropractor practice, which was followed by 10% presenting with neck problems.[ [13]] In addition, many chiropractors reported providing nutritional advice as a common component of patient care, with a lesser number of chiropractors giving specific dietary advice, such as the application of nutritional supplements into a patient's diet.[ [14]] However, to continue the implementation of preventative health advice by chiropractors to patients for chronic health conditions, it was advised that evidence-based nutrition resources used in chiropractic treatment must be further researched to ensure the practicality and efficiency of these tools in clinical practice.[ [14]] Out of sixteen regulated health-care professions within Australia, the chiropractic modality is the eleventh largest with 5,582 chiropractic practitioners registered at the end of 2021.[ [12]] Of the extensive chiropractic facilities throughout Australia, many implement patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) for lower back pain in clinical practice. One study identified that while this is a useful tool in managing patient safety and practitioner compliance, there was an obvious barrier between patients and chiropractors in understanding the important of the PROM and its operation.[ [15]] Given the existing regulating bodies managing the Australian chiropractic profession, a patient-focused approach in clinical practice is an important point of consideration when assessing the effectiveness and safety of the profession. The chiropractic modality has a strong presence within the Australian health-care system, however, as the profession continues to evolve as a complementary medicine practice, a more uniform scope of chiropractic is necessary to create cohesion between practitioners and patients. Naturopathy As a popular form of T&CM practice in Australia, naturopathy receives nearly 5 million consultations annually throughout the country.[ [16]] This profession operates mainly in private clinical practice and is a predominantly female-run profession (86.7%).[ [16] [17]] The most common modalities applied within naturopathic practices include homeopathy, massage therapies, and herbal and nutritional medicines.[ [16]] Naturopath members of the Practitioner Research and Collaboration Initiative (PRACI) network were invited to participate in a study relating to their profession, in which the most common topics of discussion in clinical practice consultations included women's health, digestive issues, diet/nutrition, stress and sleep management, and physical fitness.[ [17]] As such, this study was able to conclude that there was a specific emphasis on lifestyle prescriptions throughout the Australian naturopathic profession, despite the variety in health areas.[ [17]] This was further validated by additional study that indicated that 1 in 10 Australians suffering from a chronic condition consulted a naturopath as part of their treatment and management plan.[ [18]] It has also been reported that 59.6% of naturopathic patients use their naturopath practitioner as their primary health-care provider and 22.2% as their sole primary care provider, which is indicative of the vital role naturopaths play in the Australian health-care system.[ [18]] As the Australia naturopathy landscape evolves to accommodate existing regulatory issues surrounding the health practice, naturopathy research should prioritize clinical practice-based research and the establishment of a research network focused on this area. In addition, research is required to identify the best evidence-based interventions and to assist communication between patients and practitioners, as well as ensuring the safe application of this modality.[ [19]] Ayurveda While Ayurveda is well-recognized and established within Asian countries, this Indian traditional medicine practice is not broadly practised in Australia. It was reported that Ayurvedic practitioners accounted for 0.4% (n = 3) of the members of the PRACI, which represents multiple complementary medicine professions in Australia in 2017.[ [20]] The clinical practice localities of the PRACI Ayurvedic members include New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, and they are primarily based in urban locations.[ [20]] These Ayurvedic interventions are commonly used for endocrine health, renal conditions, sports performance, gerontology, and pediatrics, excluding complex and chronic diseases.[ [20]] Despite the potential of ayurvedic medicine to manage and treat a variety of health conditions, recognition of this profession by governing bodies is crucial to ensure the registration and regulation of Ayurvedic practitioners in Australia. Regulation of traditional and complementary medicine practitioners in Australia TCM is a registered profession by the Commonwealth Government of Australia since 2009.[ [7]] The State of Victoria, Australia, was the first jurisdiction to implement statutory regulations for TCM practitioners outside of China in the year 2000.[ [9]] This was then superseded by the Health Professions Registration Act 2005 to establish uniform standards across the nation for the regulation of complementary medicine health-care professions, including TCM.[ [21]] Under the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law, TCM is now a registered health-care profession in every Australian state and territory, which has ensured the enforcement of clinical practice regulation in each jurisdiction within Australia.[ [9]] In alignment with current regulations, TCM practitioners within Australia exhibit high professional practice standards in the administration of TCM techniques, including documenting and receipting, however, social policy must evolve as the nature of TCM within Australia evolves to ensure the practice remains regulated among practitioners.[ [9]] While statutory regulations are currently in place for TCM clinical practice in Australia, these regulations must be regularly reviewed to ensure they are updated with the changing profession. The chiropractic profession is well-acknowledged within the Australian health-care landscape, and as such has a greater level of regulation in place for practitioners. Similar to TCM practitioners, chiropractors must be registered with the Chiropractic Board of Australia and meet the Board's registration standards. The Australian Chiropractic Research Network (ACORN) is a practice-based research network (PBRN), similar to PRACI, that was established to close the research-practice gap in chiropractic clinical care, as it receives direct insight from members of the profession.[ [22]] Future research into the chiropractic profession should investigate whether defining a scope of practice would enable more appropriate regulation and function of this health service within Australia, as well as establish a framework for ensuring practitioner competency and patient safety.[ [12]] One review also emphasized the requirement for an adverse events reporting system in the Australian chiropractic profession, following a report to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency of an infant's injury following chiropractic treatment.[ [23]] In addition, although this practice maintains some degree of regulatory status in Australia, it is typically excluded from the mainstream public health-care system and general practitioners hold a level of control in public access to chiropractic services.[ [24]] The popularity and effectiveness of the chiropractic modality within the Australian health-care system warrants further enforcement by regulating bodies to narrow the scope of the practice and maintain patient safety. Despite the popularity of naturopathy within Australia, the registration of naturopaths is an ongoing issue due to poor representation under professional associations and conflict within the profession itself.[ [16]] This poses several issues for the regulation of naturopaths in Australia, as there is no statutory regulation in place for the practice by the government, and it continues to be self-regulated.[ [16]] Due to this self-regulation and as there are no restrictions for entry into the profession, unqualified naturopath practitioners can cause potential harm to patients.[ [16]] A national survey conducted on the naturopathic profession in 2004, strongly indicated of the lack of regulation within the Australian naturopathy landscape.[ [17]] While the Natural Therapies Review 2014-2015 indicated the effectiveness of naturopathy in treating patients with chronic illnesses, it also highlighted that the unregulated profession was difficult to apply in the context of the Australian health-care system.[ [18]] This was in part due to research and education into naturopathy primarily occurring in North America, however, also due to the continued exclusion of naturopathy in Australian governmental regulation, despite being addressed in every government report since the early 2000s for registration.[ [18]] Furthermore, the presence of multiple naturopathic professional associations in Australia creates complexity in the formation of a consistent and enforceable regulatory framework for the health-care profession.[ [25]] A 2018 review examined the potential consequences to the Australian naturopathy industry with proposed changes to private health insurance policies and rebate for unregistered complementary medicine practices, and addressed that the lack of statutory registration with naturopathy was primarily a result of inaction from the government, rather than the profession itself.[ [26]] The resistance by governmental bodies to implement formal registration and regulation of new complementary medicine practitioner groups impeded upon policy development in this area, as well as impacting public protective objectives outlined by health practitioner regulation.[ [27]] As the Ayurvedic medicine profession is underrepresented within the Australian health-care system, the regulations for the clinical practice of Ayurveda in Australia for practitioners are not well defined. A telephone survey conducted in 2008 among households in eight geographical regions within Victoria, Australia confirmed that 89.6% of participants believed Indian herbal medicine practitioners, including Ayurvedic practitioners, should be statutorily regulated to maximize patient safety within the profession.[ [28]] While Ayurvedic medicine consumers highly support the regulation of the health service, no move has been made to implement governmental regulation for Ayurveda due to the small number of clinical localities and lower prevalence in its use in comparison to other T&CM practices. However, to ensure the safe and consistent practice of Ayurvedic medicine within Australia, statutory regulation in this modality of T&CM is required. RESEARCH Status of traditional and complementary medicine research in Australia and key research focus As T&CM are gaining popularity and a thriving sector in Australian health care,[ [29]] there has been a significant push to generate evidence base for these practices.[ [30]] Evidence-based practice (EBP) aids in generation of research evidence, synthesis of evidence, policy development and implementation of evidence to facilitate its uptake in health care.[ [30]] Despite its prolific growth and popularity in Australia, EBP in T&CM is still in its infancy. The current literature identifies thousands of reports (both preclinical and clinical) on the health benefits of individual components commonly used in T&CM such as ginseng, St John's wort, vitamins and fish oils, however, comprehensive clinical studies on the real life use of these components which are often prescribed as formulae containing multiple components with additional dietary advice are scarce.[ [29]] From an Australian perspective, there has been several reports on the utilization and practice, perceptions and factors (potential drivers and barriers) associated with the use of the clinical efficacy of different modalities of T&CM. Interestingly, a higher rate of T&CM utilization was observed in females (mostly middle-aged women with a higher education and higher annual income) compared to males in a recent study.[ [39]] Furthermore, the authors reported that rural residents use manual T&CM therapies such as massage and chiropractic services more commonly than their urban counterparts.[ [39]] A national survey of 1427 Australian women in 2013 indicated that massage therapy was the most popular T&CM modality followed by chiropractic and naturopathy/herbal medicine.[ [32]] In terms of themes, research on the application of T&CM in integrative oncology in Australia are cancer patients have been recently estimated to use one form of T&CM during their cancer treatment in Australia.[ [5]] A study published in 2015 indicated that a significant number of Indigenous Australians (18.7%) in Queensland use T&CM for cancer care including traditional Indigenous therapy (2.8%), to visit a traditional Indigenous practitioner (2.8%), use T&CM (10.7%), to visit a T&CM practitioner (2.4%), and to attend relaxation/meditation classes (4.0%).[ [35]] This study also highlighted the urgent need to examine T&CM in large-scale in-depth studies on specific cancer types.[ [35]] Earlier, a study conducted in four cancer outpatient services in Metropolitan Adelaide indicated that 52.9%-61.5% respondents (of the 403 male patients with prostate, hematological malignancies, colorectal, lung, and other cancers) used T&CM with dietary supplements (36.1%), prayer (25.9%), herbal medicines (21.4%), and relaxation techniques/meditation (15.2%) being the most common services.[ [44]] Likewise, another recent study in 2022.[ [38]] also reported that a significant group of cancer patients in the North Queensland region is using T&CM with cannabis, magnesium, and massage being the most commonly used therapies. These users implemented T&CM to treat symptoms of cancer, side effects of standard therapy or to improve general health.[ [38]] However, Sullivan etal.[ [34]] underlined that most cancer patients in rural Australia do not disclose their use of T&CM to health professionals. Defining effective strategies to improve this lack of communication between cancer patients and health professionals is imperative through more research on T&CM.[ [34] [45] [46]] Similar recommendations were also made by Gall etal.[ [41]] for the use of T&CM among Indigenous cancer patients in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States in 2018 to help inform and ensure safe, effective and synchronized care. Utilization of T&CM in women reproductive health is another key area in indicated the feasibility, acceptability and prevalence of T&CM modalities such as acupuncture, dietary supplements including vitamins, minerals and food nutrients (fish oil) and herbal medicines in Australian women with polycystic ovary syndrome.[ [47] [48] [49]] A cross-sectional study involving 7,427 women aged 34-39 years in 2016 indicated that women used T&CM differently to treat cyclic perimenstrual (PMS) pain and discomfort in Australia and highlighted the necessity to assess the proper use of T&CM.[ [53]] Furthermore, the same research group found that Australian women used T&CM mainly to treat endometriosis and PMS, however, the treatment efficacy was uncertain.[ [54]] Similarly, Australian research has also shown the utilization of T&CM to enhance fertility as well as an increased use of herbal medicines during breastfeeding despite limited safety and efficacy data.[ [31] [50]] The implementation of T&CM in reproductive medicine i.e., pregnancy-related conditions was reviewed in 2016 and the scarcity of consistent study quality to evaluate the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of T&CM modalities was emphasized.[ [55]] However, the authors reported that high quality evidence support the use of herbal medicines (such as ginger), vitamin B6 and acupuncture in treating pregnancy associated nausea and vomiting.[ [55]] It was also noted by the authors that the use of ginger to manage nausea was incorporated in national clinical guidelines and Vitamin B6 is currently considered the first-line of treatment of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.[ [55]] Another study by the same research group reported in 2014 that acupuncturists receive a significant referrals to treat women's reproductive health complaints in Australia and New Zealand as found in their survey completed by 377 acupuncturists.[ [51]] The prevalence of T&CM in the management of general pain (back/spinal pain and knee pain) in Australia has also been stated in several reports while underlining several inconsistencies of T&CM pain research primarily attributed to the lack of government funding and collaborative research in Australia.[ [56] [57] [58]] Collectively, regardless of the proliferation of T&CM use, research on its EBP is still in its early stages in Australia. This can be attributed to several key barriers including lack of facilities, awareness, capability and resources to generate evidence base in T&CM.[ [30] [59] [60] [61]] In particular, a recent study Veziari etal.[ [30]] identified two major barriers in EBP of T&CM in Australia and New Zealand - (a) capacity (scarcity of resources, adequate governance and leadership, lack of competency, bias from both outside and within T&CM, and insufficient time for research) and (b) culture (inherent views in T&CM, and lack of communication both within and outside T&CM). Similarly, previous reports highlighted several barriers including financial, methodological and ethical obstacles which prevail in T&CM research worldwide.[ [62]] In an Australian context, inadequate funding was identified to be one of the biggest factors hindering the progress of T&CM research.[ [58] [63]] To address this issue, utilization of a funding model which uses a certain percentage of the GST raised from the T&CM industry and administered through national funding bodies such as the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia along with T&CM experts has also been proposed.[ [63]] In addition, it has been found that most research performed thus far to generate evidence base of T&CM is quantitative in nature which often fail to encapsulate the complexities and intricacies of these practices.[ [30]] Potential detrimental effects of T&CM (especially herbal medicines) as a result of their interactions with standard pharmaceutical drugs is another concern related to the growing simultaneous use of T&CM products with Western Medicine (WM) and it requires further investigations.[ [5] [43] [64]] Adverse effects of T&CM due to intrinsic (inherent to the product) and extrinsic (failure to follow good manufacturing practice) factors also warrant more research to ensure their safety and efficacy.[ [64]] In addition, most research has been conducted in only a few disciplines of T&CM including osteopathy and chiropractic with most studies performed in the United States.[ [30]] Therefore, there is a significant knowledge gap in EBP of T&CM in Australia, which could be addressed through intensive and targeted approach. For EBP of T&CM, frameworks specifically the TranslatingResearchintoPublicHealthActionFramework.[ [65]] have been recommended for a targeted approach at multiple levels including individual, policy, organizational and environmental.[ [30]] Philosophical differences between T&CM and WM practices are also considered a barrier in T&CM research, which could be mitigated through collaboration between T&CM and WM institutions.[ [30] [66]] As many T&CM studies been found to have methodological flaws, strong interdisciplinary collaborations between research scientists and T&CM practitioners can resolve these difficulties and inconsistencies of T&CM research.[ [58] [63]] Furthermore, intra-professional collaboration among different disciplines/modalities of T&CM through effective governance and leadership is also crucial for improving its evidence base.[ [30] [58]] A recent critical review included and analyzed the studies performed by two Australian T&CM PBRNs-the ACORN (a network for chiropractors) and the PRACI (a network for complementary and alternative medicine professionals).[ [33]] The review concluded that these kinds of PBRNs provide a robust platform to conduct research on different key aspects of T&CM including information about T&CM use and users, practice patterns, its efficacy and safety as well as doctor-patient communication, however, more such networks are necessary to generate evidence base for T&CM.[ [33]] To tackle the issues related to T&CM education, research and awareness, different teaching and research institutions have been established in Australia. Currently, Australia has several world-leading research institutions for complementary medicine including National Institute of Complementary Medicine Health Research Institute (NICM HRI) at Western Sydney University, the Australian Research Centre in Complementary and Integrative Medicine (ARCCIM) at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), China-Australia international Centre for Chinese Medicine at RMIT University, National Centre for Naturopathic Medicine at Southern Cross University and Australian Centre for Complementary Medicine Education and Research, a joint venture of the University of Queensland and Southern Cross University, Australia.[ [67]] National Institute of Complementary Medicine Health Research Institute Western Sydney University plays a major role in ensuring Australians have access to reliable preclinical and clinical evidence and policy development on complementary medicine and treatments. NICM HRI (formally known as National Institute of Complementary Medicine) seed funded by the Australian Commonwealth Government and New South Wales Government, based at Western Sydney University is one of the largest T&CM research facilities in Western countries and a leader in complementary and integrative medicine research and policy in Australia.[ [68]] NICM HRI plays a key role in the generation of evidence base in T&CM in Australia through both qualitative and quantitative research in preclinical and clinical settings with a bench-to-bedside approach. The key focus of NICM HRI includes the identification and refinement of national research priorities in T&CM, evaluation of quality, safety and therapeutic efficacy of different modalities of T&CM (such as Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture Ayurveda, and mind and body therapies including yoga and Tai Chi), deciphering their molecular mechanisms of action against various diseases, and contribute to clinical practice guidelines development and work in conjunction with government, consumers, industry and other stakeholders to strengthen relevant policy.[ [68]] Over the years, it has built a wide network of collaboration among national and international researchers, practitioners, industry, and government, which enables it in tackling different key areas of T&CM research strengthening scientific evidence to support the use of T&CM. NICM HRI offers medical research opportunities (both preclinical and clinical) to undergraduate (Bachelor's and Honors) and postgraduate (through research higher degree programs such as Master of Research, Master of Philosophy, and Doctor of Philosophy) students. Overall, in addition to several emerging research areas such as Bush medicine, mind and body therapies and medicinal cannabis, NICM is focused on improving health and well-being through research on different key chronic illnesses including cancer, cardiovascular, reproductive, and neurodegenerative disorders.[ [69]] Other complementary research institutions in Australia The ARCCIM examines a broad range of areas that incorporate T&CM such as women's health (pregnancy, back pain, cancer care and allergies), T&CM in palliative care, impact of T&CM on primary health care, issues in health policies and T&CM in chronic illness and ageing.[ [70]] Furthermore, the ARCCIM provides postgraduate opportunities (Master's and PhD) for individuals who are interested in these areas of research.[ [70]] The National Centre for Naturopathic Medicine at Southern Cross University focuses on the advancement of naturopathic research, education, and the profession itself aligning with its core pillars - education, research, and advocacy.[ [71]] In 1996, the Southern Cross University developed its first complementary medicine research higher degree program in the naturopathy.[ [18]] The Australian Centre for Complementary Medicine Education and Research in Southern Cross University and the University of Queensland was established in both Lismore and Brisbane, Australia with additional teaching, research, and staff to enable a more holistic education for health professionals.[ [72]] EDUCATION With the increased usage of T&CM worldwide, there is an increased demand for its integration into health professional education. However, the incorporation of T&CM education into health professional curricula is handled differently by countries and among institutions.[ [73]] Therefore, this section intends to describe the current prevalence of knowledge and educational level approaches such as university-level courses, private colleges, and public awareness programs in the field of T&CM across Australia. University-level and private college courses Several universities across Australia offer courses related to T&CM such as RMIT University, Queensland University of Technology, the University of Queensland, the University of Newcastle, Griffith University, La Trobe University, Charles Sturt University, and Western Sydney University.[ [74]] Predominantly, these universities offer diplomas, higher diplomas, Bachelor's, and Master's degrees in complementary medicine. For instance, RMIT offers undergraduate courses in Chinese medicine, chiropractic and osteopathy and postgraduate masters in acupuncture and Chinese Herbal medicine. Likewise, Charles sturt university offers a Bachelor's degree in complementary medicine whereas Western Sydney University offers both Bachelor's and Master's degrees in TCM. In a conversation article by Tiralongo[ [75]] - a senior lecturer at Griffith University mentioned that evidence-based T&CM education is integrated throughout their pharmacy curriculum, as a core part of their professional degree. In addition, the author reported that T&CM research and education had a moderating effect on students' attitudes toward T&CM whereas the training encouraged the students in better decision making. The author also stated their specifically designed 'short course in integrative medicine for pharmacists' which has been accredited for continuous professional development.[ [75]] The Endeavour College of Natural Health is the largest private higher education provider of natural medicine courses and practice-relevant research. The Endeavour College of Natural Health offers Bachelor's degrees in naturopathy, acupuncture therapies, and nutritional and dietic medicine.[ [76]] In addition, the Honors program in naturopathy introduced in 2016 at the Endeavour College of Natural Health is Australia's first research higher degree program in a private T&CM college.[ [18]] Although Ayurvedic medicine is slowly gaining popularity in Australia, none of the Australian universities offers training in Ayurveda.[ [77]] Unlike in the university sector, diploma and certificate level IV courses in Ayurveda are offered in various government-accredited private colleges in Australia.[ [77]] For instance, Nature Care College in Sydney provides the pathway to becoming an Ayurvedic lifestyle practitioner through a 2-year training with the option of further study in Pune, India.[ [77]] In addition, various professional associations for Ayurvedic therapists were formed including the Australasian Association of Ayurveda and the Maharishi Vedic Health Practitioners Association in Adelaide and New South Wales (Australia), respectively.[ [77]] The Australian Institute of Holistic Medicine in Perth (Australia) was established by two medical practitioners with the intention of educating and promoting the principles of a healthy and happy lifestyle.[ [78]] This institute offers a balanced curriculum in both modern and traditional healing arts.[ [78]] including courses in Ayurveda.[ [77]] The Australasian Institute of Ayurvedic Studies located in Australia and New Zealand is the only training institute in Australasia which offer recognized Ayurvedic qualifications.[ [79]] From this institute, students are able to receive fundamental principles, practices, and clinical training with a comprehensive curriculum of Ayurvedic medicine outside the India.[ [79]] Furthermore, the Australian Institute of Higher and Further Education offers diplomas and advanced diplomas with clinical training in Ayurveda to become an Ayurvedic practitioner or therapist. Upon completion, graduates are eligible to obtain a membership in many professional associations such as the Australian Natural Therapists Association which represents Ayurvedic practitioners in Australia.[ [80]] The Health Institute Australasia located in Gold Coast and Melbourne (Australia) provides government-accredited diplomas, advanced diplomas, and distant learning courses to become an Ayurvedic lifestyle consultant and/or Ayurvedic practitioner.[ [81]] These courses have been developed with the guidance of numerous teachers and practitioners in Ayurveda, including representatives of the health-care industry and training authorities.[ [81]] Issues related to T&CM education including attitudes, awareness, and standards A recent national survey conducted by Mollart et al.[ [82]] investigated Australian midwives' knowledge, education, or training of T&CM. The authors reported that over half of the participants who completed the survey had a certain level of education or training (from self-learning to diploma) in T&CM with multiple modalities including acupressure, aromatherapy, massage, and reflexology. The authors also suggested including evidence-based information on T&CM modalities in midwifery education programs.[ [82]] An exploratory cross-sectional study was undertaken by Park et al.[ [83]] to investigate the knowledge of and attitudes toward T&CM of dental students from different Australian Universities - Charles Sturt, Griffith, James Cook, La Trobe, Adelaide, Melbourne, Queensland, Sydney, and Western Australia. Out of 1300 students (in their final 2 years of study) who were provided with the survey questionnaire, only 185 students completed it. Based on the findings, the authors concluded that the attitudes of dental students toward T&CM therapies and the need to integrate them into the dental curriculum were generally positive. However, approximately three out of four dental students in this survey had little to no knowledge of T&CM. The authors also suggested to identify and address specific knowledge gaps to have an improved dental curriculum. Another qualitative study was carried out by Steel et al.[ [84]] to identify the perceptions, attitudes and experiences among the seven focus groups of representatives such as students and professional leaders in the naturopathic field in Australia toward the role of scientific and traditional knowledge within contemporary naturopathic education. The responses of the participants revealed the necessity of four major areas, (a) finding the balance between traditional and scientific knowledge, (b) supporting the balance through critical appraisal in the curriculum, (c) the exclusion of traditional knowledge from the critical gaze and (d) focusing on critical thinking in the naturopathic curriculum. With its outcome, this study highlighted the importance of education and knowledge in maintaining a clear and consistent definition of traditional and scientific knowledge in the Australian naturopathic education.[ [84]] Another study by Brosnan[ [85]] conducted semistructured interviews with 20 lecturers in TCM and osteopathy, across five Australian universities to identify the epistemic cultures in T&CM. The findings depicted \"epistemic disunity\" with contrasting ontological and epistemological perspectives between TCM and osteopathy. Compared to osteopathy academics, TCM lecturers had adopted bio-scientific models of research largely, conducting laboratory work and trials while their teaching included traditional theories. On the other hand, osteopathy academics were more critical of dominant approaches and were focused on reframing notions of evidence to account for experiences, with some advocating qualitative research. This study further highlighted the challenges facing the academic T&CM such as creating evidence and aspects of other professions.[ [85]] Templeman et al.[ [86]] reported findings of a constructivist grounded theory method study that involved data from interviews with 30 medical students that was undertaken to identify key strategies for integrating T&CM literacy education into Australian medical curricula. The participants supported a longitudinal integrative and pluralistic approach to medicine. In addition, key areas including awareness of common patient use, evidence, and information relevant to future clinical practice were identified for complementary medicine literacy education. Moreover, students preferred interactive case-based, experiential, and dialogical didactic techniques that are multi-professional and student-centered. The authors also suggested strategies that provide key elements of CM literacy within research, field-based practice, and didactic teaching over the entirety of the curriculum.[ [86]] As Ys Lee et al.[ [87]] report many university students feel uncertain and skeptical about T&CM as a medical system due to the less weight and minor emphasis that most universities place on it. However, in Australia, the evidence and prevalence of T&CM are expanding supporting its integration into mainstream medicine. Also, this integration is nourished by the Australian Medical Association, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and by government support. The authors also supported the notion that exposure to T&CM education was proportional to its perceived value.[ [87]] Evidence for regulation of education in traditional and complementary medicine across Australia In a recent systematic reviews conducted by Car\u00e8 et al.[ [88]] the authors described the attitudes of some selected stakeholders such as education providers towards the regulation of T&CM professions in some countries including Australia. Furthermore, the authors insisted on the importance of establishing a suitable regulatory framework regarding the education and practice of T&CM.[ [88]] A postal questionnaire survey by Bensoussan et al.[ [89]] described the positive changes in educational standards and postgraduate education of T&CM as a result of government regulations in Australia. The authors further reported that approximately 31% of Australian herbal and naturopathic practitioners are qualified in another health-care discipline whereas 44% of them reported poor inter-professional communication emphasizing the continuation of the professional education.[ [89]] However, Lin et al.[ [90]] stated the absence of any uniform minimum standard of education and concerns about inadequately trained or incompetent practitioners. In addition, the authors stated that each of the considered education providers supported the statutory regulations while only 45% of them accepted a Bachelor's degree as the minimum requirement.[ [90]] Semistructured Canaway[ [91]] and Wardle et al.[ [92]] described the registration of naturopathic practitioners as crucial in raising public awareness and providing a guarantee regarding practitioner education while the regulations could overcome the problems in the education of practitioners.[ [91] [92]] Steel et al.[ [93]] interviewed T&CM practitioners specializing in maternity care in Queensland and reported that the participants' concern about education standards was due to a lack of consistency across institutions and qualifications whereas some suggested the importance of regulations in terms of referring peers to appropriate colleges of education. A recent study by Dunn et al.[ [25]] examined the global naturopathic education, regulation and practice frameworks of organizations including professional associations, educational organizations and regulatory boards. Particularly in Australia, seven national professional associations were reported and found to create complexity and inhibit educational and professional progress. Furthermore, the authors found that most global naturopathic education institutions were private and profit-oriented, and their delivery of programs adhere to a national qualification framework while that in Australia is Tertiary Education Quality Standards Agency. Park and Canaway[ [94]] conceptualized how the integration of T&CM into the national health system contributed to achieving universal health coverage. According to their categorization of countries, Australia is considered to have \"mixed-level recognition\" of T&CM where the consumer-led use of T&CM modalities is extensive with minimal government support at the service-delivery level. However, the Australian government regulates T&CM products and some practitioners (chiropractors, osteopaths and TCM practitioners) concerning potential quality, and safety, providing some government support in the education of T&CM practitioners.[ [94]] Furthermore, to develop an agenda for policy, practice, education and research for EBP in T&CM, a secondary analysis of qualitative data using a roundtable discussion was carried out by Leach et al.[ [95]] with seventeen experts in the field of T&CM. The outcome identified three broad fields of action that include, a) defining terminology, b) defining the EBP approach, and c) fostering social movement which formed the framework of the agenda.[ [95]] REGULATION OF TRADITIONAL AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE PRODUCTS IN AUSTRALIA Regulatory framework Australia has a robust and innovative regulatory framework for regulating medicine including complementary medicines. Raw herbs and individual herbal extracts dispensed by practitioners for individual patients in their clinics are controlled by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service for infection control and the Australian Customs for the control of restricted substances and endangered species. Manufactured T&CM products are regulated by the TGA, the drug regulator of the Australian government as \"complementary medicines\" [ [Figure 1](javascript:void(0))]. As aforementioned, complementary medicine is defined as a therapeutic good consisting wholly or principally of one or more designated active ingredients, each of which has a clearly established identity and a traditional use[ [96]] and include traditional medicines, herbal medicines, homoeopathic medicines, anthroposophic medicines, essential oils, nutritional supplements and others (e.g., flower, shell and gem essences). The TGA has adopted a risk-based approach in regulating therapeutic goods to ensure the benefits of a medicine outweigh its potential harms. The TGA maintains a register, ARTG. All manufactured complementary medicines need to be included in the ARTG before being able to be legally imported, exported, manufactured or supplied in Australia. A complementary medicine product can be registered in a three-tiered system either as a listed medicine, an assessed listed medicine or a registered complementary medicine [ [Figure 1](javascript:void(0))]. The majority of complementary medicines are currently classified as listed medicine together with some lower risk over the counter products. Listed Medicines are considered by the TGA to pose a low risk to consumers. Listed medicines carry an Aust L number and can only make low-level therapeutic claim (s)/indication (s) such as maintain/support skin health selected from the Permissible Indication List from the TGA.[ [97]] The ingredients of a listed medicine must only be selected from the preapproved ingredients provided by the TGA. The TGA assesses the quality and safety of listed medicines through mandating the manufacturer to carry a TGA-recognized Good Manufacturing Practice license and maintaining the Permissible Ingredients list, respectively. The TGA does not individually assess the efficacy of a listed medicine, but the sponsor needs to hold the evidence to support its label claim. This evidence could come from scientific research and/or traditional use. Assessed Listed medicines are introduced in 2018 by the TGA as a sub-category of the Listed Medicines and carry a AUST L (A) number. Similar to a listed medicine, an Assessed Listed medicine may only use a low-risk ingredient permitted for the listed medicines. The key difference between these two is that the assessed listed pathway permits higher level indications than listed medicines using premarket assessment by the TGA of robust scientific evidence, including clinical trials in support of product efficacy. Intermediate level indications include prevention, alleviation, or cure of a nonserious disease, ailment, defect or injury such as prevention of cold sore; or restricted representation of a serious disease, condition or ailment such as the \"relief or reduction\" of symptoms including relieving symptoms associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Registered complementary medicines are considered to pose higher risks based on their ingredients or high-level therapeutic claims. Registered complementary medicines have an AUST R number and may include ingredients not in the TGA's permitted ingredients list. Registered complementary medicine are fully assessed premarket by the TGA for quality, safety and efficacy in a process similar to that of registered pharmaceutical medicines. Registered medicines are allowed to include high level indications which are not suitable for the listed or assessed listed medicines (such as treatment of a serious disease). This needs to be supported by safety and efficacy data of finished products including rigorously designed clinical trials. New data protection schemes by the therapeutic goods administration To encourage R&D investment of complementary medicine industry in Australia, new data protection schemes have been recently introduced by the TGA. These include (1) The 5-year data protection for new formulas and indications and the 2-year data protection for new ingredients.[ [98]] Both schemes are available to the listed medicines, especially the assessed listed medicine pathway. The 5-year data protection Scheme is designed to incentivize innovation through protecting the results of clinical trials in the development of new formulations or indications. The scheme prevents competitors of the sponsor from seeking market authorization of generic forms of an assessed listed medicine based on the clinical trial data that was invested and generated by the sponsor. In addition, the scheme encourages further research and development activities by preventing others from capitalizing on their investment and innovation. Data protection applies only to the raw clinical trial efficacy data and full clinical trial study report and biostatistics report. A clinical trial may support the efficacy of more than one new intermediate indication associated with a particular assessed listed medicine. The TGA can only protect the Information currently not available in the public domain apart from within clinical trial registries. The clinical trial results can be published after the inclusion of the assessed listed medicine in the ARTG. Two-year data protection for new ingredients offers market exclusivity for new ingredients approved for use in listed medicines. The TGA prohibits unauthorized companies from using the approved new ingredient for a 2-year period. This scheme rewards the resources invested by the sponsor who researches and develops new ingredients to be used in listed medicines. At the end of the exclusivity period, the ingredient will become available for any sponsor to include in a listed medicine in the ARTG. CONCLUSION Despite the prolific growth and popularity of T&CM in Australia in the last few decades, several key aspects of EBP of T&CM still require more research, support and effort. The lack of facilities, awareness, capability and resources have been identified as the key factors inhibiting the generation of evidence base in T&CM in Australia. Furthermore, the inherent views in T&CM, and the lack of communication both within and outside T&CM also hinder the EBP of T&CM. Several inconsistencies in T&CM research (e.g., methodological flaws in studies, insufficient safety and efficacy clinical data) are also reported which can primarily be attributed to the limited government funding and collaborative research in Australia. While modalities such as Chinese medicine are well-regulated, practices such as naturopathy are self-regulated in Australia which poses a significant safety risk to patients due to inadequately trained or incompetent practitioners. The lack of communication between patients and health professionals about their T&CM use was also identified as a major challenge which can be a significant health issue due to the potential harmful interactions of T&CM (especially herbal medicines, vitamins and minerals) with standard pharmaceutical drugs. Studies in the literature have underlined the necessity of statutory regulations, formal registration and proper training and education (e.g., uniform minimum standard of education) for T&CM modalities such as naturopathy and Ayurveda. Furthermore, these regulations must be regularly reviewed and updated. A patient-focused approach in clinical practice should be implemented when assessing the effectiveness and safety of the T&CM modalities. Systematic methods to improve the communication between patients and practitioners (both T&CM and WM) are imperative for ensuring the safe application of different T&CM modalities. Similarly, intensive and targeted approaches at multiple levels including individual, policy, organizational and environmental are required to improve the EBP of T&CM in Australia. Strong and reliable scientific evidence can be generated through more preclinical and clinical studies (both qualitative and quantitative) with robust designs as collaborative research among universities, T&CM industry and practitioners. More government support is crucial for training and education of T&CM practitioners as well as for research to generate meaningful scientific evidence in T&CM.
