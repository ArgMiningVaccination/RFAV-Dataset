Though more research typically takes place after phase 3 of a clinical trial, both vaccines met criteria showing they may be effective to prevent COVID-19 during the pandemic. August 12, 2020 Pfizer-BioNTech publishes Phase 1 and 2 clinical trial results. January 2020 Genetic makeup of COVID-19 virus is identified. 2017 BioNTech clinical trial in Germany shows mRNA vaccine is effective against melanoma. 1957 Polio vaccine is made widely available. 1820 Drastic decrease in smallpox mortality after vaccination begins (dropping from 18,447 deaths to 7,858 deaths per year in London compared to the previous decade). 1902 The Biologics Control Act is the first federal legislation to control the quality of medications. It creates the Hygienic Laboratory of the U.S. Public Health Service to oversee medication and vaccine production. It eventually becomes the National Institutes of Health. 1796 English physician-scientist Edward Jenner proves his hypothesis that inoculating a person with cowpox pus can make them immune to smallpox. July 14, 2020 Moderna publishes Phase 1 and 2 clinical trial results. Phase 1 tests function, safety and dosage in a small group of healthy people. Phase 2 examines whether the vaccine behaves differently in different groups, further testing safety in a larger group. November 2019 First case of COVID-19 is confirmed in Wuhan, China. 1990s Scientists begin exploring how to simplify vaccines by using mRNA, discovering that mRNA can create a stronger type of immunity. It trains the immune system to make both antibodies to fight an intruder and killer T-cells, which kill cells infected with an intruder. 1946 Influenza vaccine is approved for civilians. 1813 Establishment of the U.S. Vaccine Agency, which continues to ensure the safety and efficacy of vaccines. 1885 Spanish physician Jaime Ferr\u00e1n develops a cholera vaccine, the first vaccine against bacterial disease. Summer 2020 Phase 3 clinical trials begin and last 10 weeks. They test how well the vaccine protects against COVID-19. Moderna: 94.5% effective Pfizer-BioNTech: 95% effective March 30, 2020 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announces Operation Warp Speed, an effort to quickly develop a COVID-19 vaccine. 2018 Moderna plant opens in Norwood, Massachusetts, to manufacture mRNA vaccines for cancer clinical trials. 1971 Combination measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine is released after the individual vaccines were released in 1963, 1967 and 1969, respectively. The mumps vaccine was developed in four years, and was the fastest-developed vaccine before the COVID-19 vaccine. 1923 Two scientists, working independently of each other, develop technology for the toxoid vaccine, which uses a toxin produced by the virus or bacteria to help protect against illness. 1800 Harvard physician-scientist Benjamin Waterhouse performs the first smallpox vaccinations on his four children. 1879 French biologist Louis Pasteur develops technology for attenuated vaccines, use weakened viruses.

This becomes common practice in many civilizations. "}
