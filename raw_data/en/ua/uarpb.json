Reed diffusers offer a lower-risk, flame-free alternative. Plus, with no need to light them, they will continually scent your home for hours on end. But which ingredients should you be avoiding? We've rounded up the best natural + non-toxic reed diffusers to help you scent your home without the need for harsh chemicals... Are reed diffusers better than candles? When it comes to home fragrancing, most of the choices come down to personal preference - whether that's the fragrance notes, the design, or the actual item you pick to scent your home. There are two main choices for home fragrancing: candles and reed diffusers. Of course, you can also opt for room sprays or essential oil diffusers, but in general, these are less popular with consumers. When picking between a candle or a reed diffuser, as previously mentioned, this comes down to personal preference. Neither one is decisively better than the other. However, there are a few pros and cons to each which might make you feel more inclined either way. Pros and cons of reed diffusers Firstly, a big pro to reed diffusers is that they are flame-free. As much as we love candles, the element of fire adds a clear safety issue. [In fact, in 2020, over 200 fires in London were connected to candle use](https://www.london-fire.gov.uk/safety/the-home/candles/#:~:text=Over%20200%20fires%20at%20home,been%20connected%20to%20candle%20use). While there certainly are ways to drastically reduce this risk, like never leaving a candle unattended, or keeping the candle away from other objects and furnishings, this risk might sway your decision to go with a reed diffuser. However, reed diffusers also have their cons. Firstly, the absence of a flame immediately lowers the 'cosiness' factor. Fire taps into a primal part of our being, triggering feelings of safety, security, warmth and contentedness. Unlike reed diffusers, candles offer multiple sensory experiences - scent, sight, feel and sometimes evening sound, if it has a crackling wooden wick.

As a reed diffuser is constantly emitting fragrance, they might not be best suited to a small, enclosed space. Try using them in more open spaces, like a kitchen or living room, where they are less likely to be overpowering. Top tip: If your reed diffuser is not throwing out much scent, try inverting the reed sticks! Are reed diffusers toxic? Not all reed diffusers are toxic. However, some of them do contain harsh chemicals, perfumes and preservatives that can cause unwanted physical side effects when inhaled. According to [the National Capital Poison Center,](http://Poison.org) some reed diffuser fragrances contain up to 70 percent isopropyl alcohol. This is the same thing as rubbing alcohol, which can cause drowsiness and vomiting when inhaled. When buying a reed diffuser, we recommend only choosing ones that are made with natural ingredients, like pure essential oils. Below, we've rounded up our favourite natural + non-toxic reed diffusers... Safety note: While essential oils are generally considered safe for human inhalation, certain scents can be harmful to animals and aquatic life. Consult your vet for more information. Human ingestion of essential oils is also potentially dangerous. Always keep reed diffusers and essential oils out of reach of pets and children.
