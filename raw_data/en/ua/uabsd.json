However, it is also a term, which describes the removal of normal metabolic wastes that accumulate from the body's normal functions. It also includes the body's process of removing foreign substances which invade us through living in a polluted world. This includes chemicals and organism that are found in our air, water, food and homes. Our bodies have a resilient ability to process these environmental substances, but sometimes we need additional support for these processes. It is now appearing that some people have an inhibited ability to maintain these functions. These people are often diagnosed with conditions like chronic fatigue, multiple chemical sensitivities, migraine headaches, fibromyalgia, and immune deficiencies such as autoimmune conditions. The Center offers comprehensive cleansing and detoxification programs. These programs include dietary regiments such as therapeutic fasting or elimination diets along with herbal and nutritional supplementation which supports the body's natural \"detox\" processes, specifically, the cytochrome P450 pathways. FAR INFRARED SAUNA TREATMENT AT STRAM CENTER We offer therapeutic Far Infrared sauna to support patients during their cleanse. Stram Center's stationary far infrared sauna targets the whole body and utilizes multiples types of wavelengths. These low temperature infrared saunas help to mobilize and eliminate toxins and chemicals from your system in a thorough, but gentle way. Far infrared heat is more deeply penetrating than higher temperature saunas and helps to dilate and expand blood vessels, allowing for greater sweating and more elimination of harmful toxins. Further, far infrared heat promotes lipolysis which is the breakdown of fat tissue. Toxins, which are stored in fat tissues, are released into the blood stream and can then be eliminated from the body through normal routes of elimination such as the skin, urinary and digestive systems. Theses saunas also increase heart rates and circulation - its like working out without exerting your muscles. Higher temperature saunas such as those found in health clubs can often stress the body, which limits the detoxification process. In addition, the deep penetrating heat of far infrared, helps relieve muscle aches, soreness and stiffness and heal tissue injuries. In Summary, the benefits of Infrared Sauna: - detoxifies the body by eliminating toxins through sweat, improves circulation, boosts the immune system, and reduces inflammation - helps to reduce pain, especially chronic pain, and improves sleep - improves skin health and reduces stress levels.
