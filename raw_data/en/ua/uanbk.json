Green tea has the second-highest antioxidant level; may lower cholesterol and help prevent cancer; flavonols in tea may also protect against tooth decay. Cocoa powder and dark chocolate have the highest level of antioxidant strength; may protect against bad cholesterol oxidation. Pecans lower cholesterol levels; may kill cancer cells. Cranberries reduce bladder and urinary tract infections, inhibit LDL oxidation; protect against atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arteries). Avocados may decrease risk of Alzheimer's and high blood pressure. Tomatoes have an anticancer effect; linked to reduced risk of heart attack; organic tomato products (tomato paste, sauce and ketchup) have two to three times more antioxidants than nonorganic. Barley and rye have an anticancer effect; reduce risk of heart disease. Spinach reduces risk of age-related macular degeneration and colon cancer. Kale has the highest overall antioxidant amount of any leafy greens; reduces risk of cataracts by 20 percent; reduces cancer risk. Almonds can lower blood cholesterol levels; may reduce risk of heart disease. Corn ghts free radicals in the retina; protects against age-related mac ular degeneration. Strawberries inhibit tumors of the tongue, esophagus and lungs; block the action of carcinogens that are linked with prostate cancer.

Top with your favorite dressing. SANDWICH OR WRAP Mix chicken slices with chipotle mayo and raw grated veggies of choice. Roll the mixture into a whole-wheat tortilla, or scoop onto whole-grain bread. Serve cold, or grill for a warm and satisfying treat! SOUP Rotisserie chicken lends slow-cooked fl avor to soups. Add 2 cups chicken chunks to 3 cans chicken broth; add a bag of mixed or stew vegetables and either 1 cup uncooked rice or 2 cups uncooked noodles or pasta. Add \u00bd teaspoon poultry seasoning. Simmer until tender. You'll have dinner in 15 minutes! PIZZA TOPPING Top a Boboli crust with \u00bd cup barbecue sauce or pizza sauce, 1 cup chopped chicken and 1 cup shredded cheese. Bake for 10 minutes at 450\u00b0F. QUESADILLA Combine shredded rotisserie chicken with a pinch of cumin. Spoon onto half of a whole-wheat tortilla. Sprinkle with shredded Monterey Jack or other cheese. Fold in half; heat on a nonstick skillet until crispy, turning to brown both sides. No butter or oil needed! Serve with salsa on the side. TACO Mix shredded chicken with your favorite ingredients\u2014 black beans, fat-free refried beans, green chilies, salsa, corn or saut\u00e9ed peppers. Heat in a microwave oven until bubbly, then spoon chicken mixture into tortillas or taco shells. Top with shredded cheese, more salsa and fat-free sour cream to taste. PASTA Ready-to-eat rotisserie chicken shortens cooking time for many recipes. Use chicken in place of beef in lasagna and other pasta casseroles. Try this quick, tasty dish that kids love: Top pasta with a sauce made of 2 cups chicken chunks and a jar of Ragu Cheesy Light Parmesan. BARBECUE Mix shredded rotisserie chicken with your favorite barbecue sauce and pile it on whole-wheat rolls. One whole chicken serves about six. Yum!

They are especially good for boosting fl avor in low-fat and low-sodium foods. For eye appeal, sprinkle whole or chopped fresh herb leaves onto casseroles, salads or soups. Herbs offer a host of health bene ts. Rosemary, sage, oregano, thyme and other herbs act as antioxidants and may inhibit blood clot formation, infl ammation and tumor activity.

Bean Basics: Picking the best coffee can be con- fusing with so many varieties available from countries all over the world. To be a better coffee judge consider three characteristics: Body, the thickness of the brew and the feel of the liq- uid in your mouth; Aroma, the scent of the cof- fee; and Snap, the acid in a brew. Different coffees have different levels of body, aroma and snap. For ex- ample, South American beans offer a moderate body, aroma and snap, which is why most breakfast blends and fl avored coffees are made with these beans. The two main types of coffee beans are Robusta or Arabica. Robusta has a full body and a woody aftertaste, good for instant coffee. Arabica has a delicate fl avor, re ned aroma and an elegant caramel aftertaste and is recognized as the superior bean. How coffee beans are roasted\u2014light, medium or dark\u2014offers mild, ro- bust or rich favor distinction. Millstone Coffee Company offers a host of coffee beans in bulk bins and prepackaged bags. Try several varieties and even mix a few to nd your perfect blend. Grinding Basics: Match the grind of whole beans to your coffeemaker and grinder. Too ne a grind may make a bitter cup of coffee; too coarse a grind may give a weak brew. Generally, ne grinds take approximately 15-30 seconds\u2014depending on the grinder\u2014and are best for use with automatic drip coffeemakers with cone-shaped lters, manual drip pots and espresso machines. Automatic drip coffeemakers with fl at-bottom lters require a medium-coarse grind and French press machines need a coarse grind. Pulse the grinder three seconds for an even grind and so you don't overheat the beans. Coffee fl avor and aroma break down quickly so grind only the amount of beans you need immediately. Brewing Basics: Start with a clean coffeemaker (clean by running a weak vinegar solution through the coffeemaker, followed by a water rinse). Fill the pot with 6 ounces cold ltered or spring water (avoid tap water as it may fl avor the coffee) for each serving. Use 1 tablespoon of coffee per 6 ounces water\u2014more or less depend- ing on t aste preference. Follow brewing instructions for your coffeemaker. Special Recipes: Make special coffee beverages with a few additions to your cup. Nestl\u00e9 Coffee-Mate Coffee Creamers turn an ordinary cup into a treat; fl avors in- clude French Vanilla, Vanilla Caramel, Hazelnut, Brul\u00e9e, Cinnamon Vanilla, Chocolate Raspberry, Toffee Nut, Irish Creme and Coconut Cream. For a quick-to- make Coffee Mocha add a packet of Swiss Miss Cocoa to a cup of coffee and top with a little French Vanilla Coffee-Mate. Torani Italian Syrups are another great way to customize your espresso or coffee. Favors include Vanilla, Caramel, Raspbery, White Chocolate, Almond, Peach and Strawberry.
