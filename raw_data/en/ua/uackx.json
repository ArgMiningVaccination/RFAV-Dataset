S2Introduction Paul Stephenson The 2008 British Guideline on the management of asthma from the British Thoracic Society (BTS) and the Scottish IntercollegiateGuidelines Network (SIGN), published in Thorax, 1provides updated, comprehensive, evidence-based guidance on asthmamanagement for all healthcare professionals. The first collaborative BTS/SIGN guideline was published in 2003. The 2008 guideline references literature published up toMarch 2007, and contains a completely rewritten section on thediagnosis of asthma as well as updated sections throughout. Asbefore, levels of evidence in the new guideline range from Level1 ++(high quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or RCTs with a very low risk of bias) to Level4 (expert opinion). Grading of recommendations ranges fromGrade A (at least one meta-analysis, systematic review, or RCTrated as 1 ++) to Grade D (evidence level 3 or 4, or extrapolated evidence from studies rated as 2+). The BTS and SIGN have worked in collaboration with many other UK professional bodies, including the General PracticeAirways Group (GPIAG), to develop the 2008 guideline. Thedevelopment process and methodology has been systematic,rigorous and extensive - clear evidence of dedicated input by theExecutive and Steering Group, the contributing committees,authors and reviewers. However, whatever the nature of guidelines - be they national, 1global,2disease-specific,1-3integrated,3-6primary care- based,3-6intended for resource-rich1,2,3,5 or for resource-poor3-6 settings - dissemination and implementation is the crucialstep. 1,2,4,7,8In most countries, primary care clinicians treat the vast majority of patients with asthma and other chronic respiratorydiseases. 9,10The GPIAG has been represented on many of the 2008 BTS/SIGN guideline working groups - including the disseminationgroup - and has liaised closely with the BTS/SIGN Executiveregarding dissemination and implementation of the key guidelinemessages into primary care. This summary should therefore beinvaluable to all GPs and primary care respiratory nurses inimplementing the 2008 guideline. Diagnosis of asthma in adults and children Mark L Levy Diagnosis in primary care The first step of management is to establish the diagnosis. Giventhe nature of primary care, with fairly short consultations duringwhich patients can present multiple unrelated and undiagnosedsymptoms, GPs often have to consider numerous differentialdiagnoses. What complicates matters is the many other tasks to beperformed during the consultation. However, in primary care thereis always the possibility of a series of consultations over time whichcan help develop and refine the diagnostic process. An integrated approach to diagnosis The 2008 BTS/SIGN guideline approach to diagnosis1is based on the primary care model, focussing on the patient's presentingsymptoms and then developing the theory and detail required toachieve an accurate diagnosis - an integrated approach adoptedpreviously by the International Primary Care Respiratory Group(IPCRG). 4,5The diagnosis of asthma is based on the clinical history and subsequent findings, complicated further by the absence ofstandardised diagnostic tests; \"there is no standardised definitionof the type, severity or frequency of symptoms, nor of the findingson investigation\". 1The guideline therefore encourages clinicians to use their knowledge and deductive skills to determine the'probability' of someone having asthma when they present withsymptoms. Principles underlying assessment of asthma control These diagnostic principles also underpin the assessment ofasthma control. Tools and instruments included in the diagnosissection of the 2008 guideline (as is also the case with the GINAguideline 2) can be used to assess asthma control; this is an area of considerable research interest.11Furthermore, there has been considerable interest in the literature on providing patients withinformation on the levels of control they can expect from theirmanagement, since many patients are resigned to the effects ofpoor asthma control. 12 Assessing the probability of a diagnosis of asthma Accuracy is clearly essential and this explains the focus of the newdiagnostic approach: \"wherever possible, try to obtain objectiveconfirmation of the diagnosis\". 1Thus, the guideline encourages clinicians to refine their diagnostic hypothesis by weighing up thefeatures that influence the probability of asthma. This novelpragmatic approach differs from the traditional advice thatclinicians should rigidly diagnose asthma according to setparameters. After initial assessment and consideration of the patient's history, physical examination and investigations, three levels ofdiagnostic probability are recommended in adults and children. Subsequent treatment and investigations are then based on thelikelihood of asthma. The three levels are: High probability - diagnosis of asthma likely Intermediate probability - diagnosis uncertain Low probability - diagnosis other than asthma likely The approach in children and adults differs in some respects. These are summarised in Figures 1 and 2. For clinicians to use this process in practice, a working knowledge of the information in Tables 1-5 helps in understandingthe clinical, epidemiological features, and other factors which candetermine the level of probability that the patient has asthma.Where these differ for adults and children, this is indicated. One of the commonest questions asked by parents is, \"Will my child grow out of their asthma?\" Possible responses and thetheory underlying these are provided in Table 3. In adults and children with a high probability of asthma the 2008 guideline advises treatment and (most importantly)follow-up review to assess the response and level of control - i.e.the use of treatment as a diagnostic tool. PRIMARY CARE RESPIRATORY JOURNAL www.thepcrj.org Copyright GPIAG - reproduction prohibited http://www.thepcrj.org Copyright General Practice Airways Group Reproduction prohibitedSummary of the 2008 BTS/SIGN British Guideline on the Management of Asthma S3In those with a low probability of asthma other diagnoses should be considered carefully. In children, particularly those aged under five, consider cystic fibrosis, congenital disorders,gastro-oesophageal reflux and bronchiectasis; referral to arespiratory specialist is advised. 13In adults, the main differential diagnoses are cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hyperventilation,vocal cord dysfunction, COPD, bronchiectasis, and lung cancer. In children and adults with an intermediate probability of asthma, watchful waiting with follow-up is advised, with orwithout a trial of treatment, all depending on the severity ofsymptoms. In those patients with an intermediate or lowprobability of asthma, or those with a high probability who do not respond to therapy, further investigations and specialistreferral may be indicated. Occupational asthma Only a minority of the estimated 15% of adults with anoccupational cause for their asthma are recognised, and primarycare clinicians should consider the possibility of occupationalasthma especially in patients in high risk occupations such aspaint spraying, industrial baking, nursing, welding and in timberworkers. Any adult with late onset asthma or recurrence ofchildhood symptoms should be asked if their symptoms improvewhen away from work - asking about symptoms solely at workwill overlook patients whose occupational asthma develops aftersome hours' delay. The best screening questions are: \"Are you better on days away from work?\"\"Are you better on holiday?\"These questions are non-specific, but positive answers indicate the possibility of occupational asthma. If so, significant peakexpiratory flow (PEF) variability on a 4-hourly chart (both at workand away from work) will assist in establishing the diagnosis.

S4Specialist assessment for patients with suspected occupational asthma is mandatory.1,2,14-18 Further diagnostic investigations Lung function : Normal lung function in asymptomatic patients does NOT necessarily rule out a diagnosis of asthma. Determiningthe variability of airflow limitation is important, since it is key toboth the initial asthma diagnosis and recognition of poor asthmacontrol which requires intervention. In older children and adults, the variability of lung function measurements combined with trials of treatment may helpincrease the probability of asthma diagnosis. Spirometry: An improvement in forced expiratory volume inone second (FEV 1) of over 12% from baseline in children, and over 400ml in adults, indicates reversible airflow obstructionand supports the diagnosis of asthma. Peak expiratory flow: No data is available for acceptablelevels of variability of PEF in children. Therefore clinicians needto make a clinical judgement on the significance of PEF changefrom baseline or after bronchodilators. In adults, asthma islikely if the PEF variability is over 20% and 8% in the case offour or two readings a day, respectively. Therefore, a chart withtwo readings a day, showing variability over 8%, stronglyimplies asthma in adults with a suggestive history. 1 Allergy tests: Positive skin tests, blood eosinophilia (>4%) andraised sIgE to cat, dog or house dust mite, increase theprobability of asthma in a child over five years with wheeze. Chest X-rays are indicated in adults and children with severe disease or clues to other conditions than asthma. 1,5 Tests of airway hyper-responsiveness, including challenge tests, eosinophilic airway inflammation, induced sputumdifferential eosinophil count, or the fraction of exhaled nitricoxide (Fe N0), are currently outside the domain of primary care, apart from a few specialised general practices. 19Specialist referral is required if these tests are needed. Exercise testing in children, where significant reduction in PEF before and after six minutes of running may help increase thelikelihood that a patient has asthma. Monitoring asthma The new guideline has included monitoring in the diagnosissection. 1Monitoring facilitates the diagnostic process by determining patients' response to treatment, reinforcing orreducing the probability of asthma, while also providing clinicians PRIMARY CARE RESPIRATORY JOURNAL www.thepcrj.orgMore than one of the following symptoms: Wheeze Breathlessness Cough Chest tightnessParticularly if: Worse at night or the early morning Triggers (exposure to): - exercise- animals- damp / cold air- aspirin/beta blockers History of atopic disorder Family history of wheeze on auscultation Unexplained low FEV 1or PEF readings Unexplained peripheral blood eosinophilia Table 4: Clinical features that increase the probability of asthma in adults [reproduced with permission].

Various tools, some validated, are listed,together with their indications, interpretation and sources, mostwith the aim of reducing underestimation of patients' symptomsor levels of control 1,20,21(Box 1). These include composite symptom and quality of life scores, lung function tests, exacerbations,inhaler technique and compliance assessment systems. Cliniciansare advised to use some of these in day-to-day practice, 1 particularly the composite symptom questionnaires such as the (asyet unvalidated) RCP 3 questions 22(see Box 2) and the Asthma Control Test (ACT) questionnaire. Management of chronic asthma Non-pharmacological management Hilary Pinnock Allergen avoidance and dietary supplements Primary care clinicians are familiar with requests for advice onallergen avoidance, dietary measures and supplements thatpatients hope will improve their asthma. However, the 2008BTS/SIGN guideline assesses most of the popular non-pharmacological interventions as 'unproven' because of thelimited evidence base. 1There are two main exceptions: smoking is associated with wheezing in infancy and persistent asthma inadult life, so that smoking cessation not only benefits the smokerbut also reduces the impact of passive smoking on members of thefamily; and weight reduction has been shown to improve asthmasymptoms in obese patients. The only other intervention withsufficient evidence to support a Grade C recommendation isbreast feeding for at least four months which, apart from generalhealth benefits, may protect against early onset of asthma. House dust mite (HDM) allergen is a recognised trigger for asthma symptoms, but reducing levels of HDM alone does notconfer measurable improvement in asthma control. Patientsshould be aware of this before they embark on complex, andoften expensive, avoidance strategies. 23-25Similarly, dietary manipulation (e.g. supplements of magnesium, selenium, fishoils, anti-oxidants, probiotics) are of unproven value. therapies The Buteyko breathing technique controls hyperventilation andreduces asthma symptoms, but with no effect on lung function. 1Yoga can reduce bronchial hyperreactivity.1There is no evidence to support acupuncture, ionisers, homeopathy or Chinese herbal therapies. Occupational asthma A diagnosis of occupational asthma has significant implications forthe patient, and GPs may have an important supportive role.Prompt removal from the allergen is critical since prolongedexposure worsens the prognosis. 1,14-18Employers have a legal obligation to 'prevent or adequately control exposure' torespiratory allergens, and the Health and Safety Executive providesadvice on suitable strategies; 26but in reality a third of patients with occupational asthma face unemployment or loss of income.14-18,27 Information about Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit isavailable from the benefits agency.Pharmacological management of chronic asthma in adults Mike Thomas The aims of chronic asthma management Guidance on the pharmacological management of chronic asthma occupies a central position in the 2008 BTS/SIGN guideline.1The aim of asthma management is to achieve a very high level ofdisease control (see Box 3) with minimum side effects. 'High'control is now defined as no symptoms and no need for rescuemedication, as opposed to the 'minimal' levels permitted in the2003 guideline. There is new emphasis on recognising that eachpatient will have different personal goals for their asthmamanagement and that some individuals wish to balance perfectcontrol against the potential side effects or inconvenience oftaking medication needed to achieve and maintain this. The focuson patient-set targets recognises the need for dialogue withpatients to achieve a workable partnership, recognising theirneeds and preferences as well as the ideal of perfect control. Thisshould result in better-informed patients who are able to makerational decisions 12- thereby reducing poor adherence with regular preventer therapy28and poor outcomes.29,30 Stepwise therapy The familiar stepwise approach is maintained (Figure 3), althoughthere are a number of important changes and shifts in emphasis.The aim of pharmacological treatment remains to achieve andmaintain control by stepping up or down as appropriate. As withthe international GINA guideline, 2the level of treatment is dictated by an assessment of control rather than by an assessment of'severity' (which is difficult to assess in treated patients). The needto check adherence, inhaler technique and trigger factor exposurebefore initiating new drug therapy is stressed.

RCP 3 questions22 Copyright GPIAG - reproduction prohibited http://www.thepcrj.org Copyright General Practice Airways Group Reproduction prohibitedML Levy et al. S6In summary, all patients should be prescribed short-acting 2-agonists (SABAs) for 'as required' short term reliever therapy (Step 1, mild intermittent asthma), and low tomoderate dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)should be initiated in those with persistentsymptoms (Step 2, regular preventer therapy).Add-on therapy with a trial of an inhaledlong-acting 2-agonist (LABA) as the first choice option should be commenced if thepatient is still uncontrolled (Step 3, initial add-on), with trials of other add-on medicationand higher dose ICS at Step 4 (persistent poorcontrol). Maintenance oral steroid treatment(Step 5) should only be used under specialistsupervision. There is greater focus on 'stepping down' treatment, with an equally prominent'downwards' arrow in Figure 3 advising theclinician to 'move down to find and maintainthe lowest controlling step'. Many patients onhigher dose ICS can have their dose reducedwithout loss of asthma control. 31Stepping down (reductions in medication) can be considered in patientswho have been stable for three months, by reducing the ICS dose(25-50% reduction each time) or by discontinuing add-ontherapy. More detailed advice on when to 'step up' is also provided in the 2008 guideline, in particular, when to start treatment withICS (Box 4); a patient needing to use rescue short-actingbronchodilators more than three times a week should beregarded as uncontrolled and ICS should be added. Any patientusing more than two SABA inhalers per month or >10 puffs perday is at high risk (including risk of fatal or near-fatal asthma) andin need of urgent attention. 1 Regular preventer therapy: Step 2 Inhaled steroids (ICS) remain the treatment of choice for persistentasthma. Other than ciclesonide, which may be given as once-dailydosage, ICS should be given in twice-daily doses, although once-daily dosing may be considered in mild stable cases. 32The starting dose of ICS will usually be 400mcg/day for CFC-containingbeclometasone (BDP) preparations to their greater orhigher lung deposition). The potency equivalence for ciclesonide isnot established, although evidence suggests lower systemic andlocal side effects. 33Whether different types of ICS are safer or more effective is not clear from current evidence. Higher ICS doses can be used as initial treatment in more severe asthma, although previous advice to start 'very high' andstep down has been shown to confer no benefit and should beabandoned. 1However, it has become clear from recent evidence that people with asthma who smoke get less effect from ICS, andhigher doses (e.g. >1000mcg/day) may be needed due to thepatient's smoking-related steroid resistance. Every effort shouldbe made to stop asthmatic patients smoking. The guideline contains an expanded section considering the safety profile of ICS: at doses below 800mcg/day (BDPequivalent) there is little evidence of local or clinically significantsystemic side effects other than dysphonia and oral candidiasis. 1 Some patients will be using other topical steroids (e.g. skin andnasal preparations) and the total steroid load should beconsidered and kept as low as is consistent with therapeuticeffectiveness. Previous advice to double the dose of ICS at the time of an exacerbation has been invalidated, 1although there is some evidence that a five-fold increase may be of use in adults on alow dose (200mcg/day BDP equivalent) of ICS. 34However, the new guideline states that this policy should not be extrapolatedto patients already taking higher doses of ICS and that furtherevidence is needed. Step 3: Initial add-on A trial of a long-acting 2-agonist (LABA) remains the add-on treatment of choice for patients whose asthma remains uncontrolledon ICS alone; LABAs should never be used without ICS in asthma dueto safety concerns following prospective and anecdotal studies whichshowed an increase in asthmatic patients using LABAs alone. 35,36 However, there is no evidence of any increased risk when a LABA isused in conjunction with ICS for asthma. 37 The level at which add-on therapy should begin cannot be defined completely, but all adults given a LABA should be on atleast 200mcg of BDP-equivalent ICS a day, and no patient shouldbe on >800mcg ICS without a prior trial of a LABA. Although the PRIMARY CARE RESPIRATORY JOURNAL www.thepcrj.orgPatients should start treatment at the step most appropriate to the initial severity of their asthma.

Copyright GPIAG - reproduction prohibited http://www.thepcrj.org Copyright General Practice Airways Group Reproduction prohibitedSummary of the 2008 BTS/SIGN British Guideline on the Management of Asthma S7overall effect of treating with both ICS and LABA is the same when the ICS and LABA are given by separate or ICS/LABAcombination inhalers 1,2there is a strong argument (endorsed by NICE) for giving these drugs as a combination ICS/LABAcombination inhaler which ensures that the LABA cannot betaken without the ICS. 1,2 The new guideline emphasises the need to strive for high levels of asthma control, with no breakthrough symptoms orexacerbations. A study in which the aim was to obtain 'total control'in patients using varying strengths of the fluticasone/salmeterolcombination inhaler showed that significantly more patientsobtained guideline-defined control 2more rapidly, and at a lower total dose of ICS, compared to using fluticasone alone.38,39 The combination budesonide/formoterol inhaler can be used as rescue medication (instead of a SABA) in addition to its use asregular maintenance controller therapy (Single inhalerMaintenance And Reliever Therapy - the 'SMART' regime) inadult patients (aged 18 years and over) at Step 3 who are poorlycontrolled. There is considerable evidence showing this to be aneffective 2,40,41and cost-effective42treatment option. The SMART regime has not yet been investigated with other combinationinhalers, and requires careful patient education. Not all patients respond in the same way to a given therapy, and the guideline recognises that some patients may not respondto a LABA; in which case the LABA should be stopped, and ifpatients remain uncontrolled on 800mcg/day of BDP-equivalentICS, other add-on options can be tried - such as leukotrienereceptor antagonists (LTRAs) or theophylline; LTRAs may be agood option in patients with exercise-induced asthma and inpatients with co-morbid allergic rhinitis. 1 Steps 4 and 5: Severe asthma A small number of patients may require higher doses of ICS ormultiple add-on therapies. New treatments include anti-TNF alphatherapy (for which evidence is currently inadequate to recommendits use outside clinical trials) and anti-IgE monoclonal antibody(omalizumab) which reduces the levels of free IgE. Omalizumab isnow licensed for patients on high dose ICS and LABA who havean allergic trigger, raised IgE level, and who remain uncontrolled -but it should only be used under specialist supervision. Managing asthma in pregnancy Asthma treatment is safe in pregnancy and the aim is to maintaingood asthma control. 1The risk of harm to the fetus from severe or chronically-undertreated asthma outweighs any possible small riskfrom SABAs, ICS, LABAs, LTRAs and theophyllines, though LTRAsshould not be commenced for the first time during pregnancy. 1 About a third of pregnant women will experience an improvement intheir asthma, a third will be worse, and a third will remain the same. Pharmacological management of chronic asthma in children Iain R Small Managing different age groups When addressing the needs of children with asthma, there areclearly different problems and different treatment options when managing a two-year old and a 12-year old. The 2008 guideline therefore refers to two age groups, 'children under 5 years', and 'children aged 5-12 years',although in some situations the guidance is the same. Over theage of 12 years adult guidance applies - although it should benoted that some treatments and strategies (such as SMART) donot apply under the age of 18 years. 1,2 Gaining control The emphasis for patients and clinicians is on gaining asthmacontrol. The definition of good asthma control is the same inchildren as in adults (see Box 3), with the proviso that lungfunction measurements cannot be used reliably to monitor orguide asthma management in children under 5 years. A stepwise approach (see Table 6) In younger children, the early abolition of symptoms will guidetreatment choices. In older children (>5 years), PEF monitoring canalso be used to assess control. Although this stepwise method isvery familiar, children should start treatment on the step mostappropriate to their presenting level of symptoms and severity,within the licensed recommendation of the therapies beingconsidered, aiming to achieve early symptom control. The clinicianshould be willing to begin at any treatment step - to step up if control is not achieved, and to step down once good control isestablished. 1 There is no evidence to support the use of ICS in the treatment of viral-induced wheeze in infancy, for whom a 'watchand wait' policy should be pursued wherever possible. 1,13 In all age groups, the presence of any one of the following factors indicating poor asthma control should prompt re- assessment; using inhaled 2-agonists three times a week or more; being symptomatic three times a week or more waking one night a week due to symptoms In addition to using these three indictors of poor asthma control, in children aged 5-12 years an exacerbation requiring PRIMARY CARE RESPIRATORY JOURNAL www.thepcrj.org No daytime symptoms No night-time awakening due to asthma No need for rescue medication No exacerbations No limitations on activities including exercise Normal lung function (FEV 1and/or PEF > 80% predicted or best) No side effectsBox 3.

S8oral steroids in the previous two years is also a sign of poor asthma control. Exercise-induced asthma Exercise-induced symptoms are a reflection of poorly controlledasthma and should be dealt with as such. True exercise-inducedasthma (which is rare) should be managed with SABAs, preferablyused before exercise. In all circumstances, the following should be checked before therapy is changed; adherence with existing therapy inhaler technique elimination (where possible) of trigger factors Doses and devices Although CFC-containing BDP is being phased out, it remains thestandard dose equivalent for all ICS preparations. The comparabledose of other ICS must be calculated, taking particular care withmore potent drugs. No inhaler device should be prescribed without effective training, assessment and regular review oftechnique . There is no evidence to support nebulised therapy in younger children as opposed to a pressurised metered-doseinhaler (pMDI) and spacer (with a mask in younger children). Inchildren under five years, this is the preferred delivery method fortreating exacerbations. In 5-12 year olds, there is evidence of similar efficacy for pMDI/spacer and dry powder inhalers (DPIs). 1 Safety and efficacy Short-acting bronchodilatorsIn both age groups, SABAs are safe and effective. There is noevidence that regular use is more effective than 'as required' use;the latter should be recommended to patients and parents. In children under 5 years, ipratropium bromide is also a safe and effective bronchodilator. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)Advice on ICS can be divided into three categories: - Daily doses of 400mcg (BDP equivalent) or less ICS are the most effective 'preventer' drug for achieving asthmacontrol in older children. At recommended doses (see Table 6),they are safe and effective, even in infants and young childrenwith asthma.- Daily doses between 400-800mcg (BDP equivalent)Above 400mcg/day there is evidence of systemic side effects suchas growth failure and adrenal suppression. Additional treatmentsshould be introduced, keeping the ICS dose at or below 400mcgwhere possible. Children should have their height measured as part of their regular asthma review, though this cannot be used as a proxyindicator for adrenal function. - Daily doses greater than 800mcg (BDP equivalent)Adrenal insufficiency of clinical significance has been shown tooccur at ICS doses of 800mcg and above in children. Whenchildren require such dosages; Specific written advice about steroid replacement during illnessshould be part of a written action plan A Specialist Paediatrician should be involved in care and review Those with symptoms of shock and decreased consciousness should receive parenteral hydrocortisone and should beadmitted to hospital for monitoring and treatment Concomitant use of other steroid preparations such as creams and intra-nasal steroids must be taken into account whencalculating risk/benefit. Long-acting 2-agonists (LABA) When added to ICS therapy, LABAs are a safe treatment,improving lung function and symptoms, and reducingexacerbations. As with adults, 35-37they should always be an add-on treatment to ICS therapy, and should never be used as singleagents in asthma. PRIMARY CARE RESPIRATORY JOURNAL www.thepcrj.orgSTEP Under 5 years 5-12 years Stepping down The lowest possible dose of ICS should be used to achieve control. When control has been achieved, the ICS dose should be stepped down where possible, or add ontherapies withdrawn. Patients should then be reviewed at an appropriate interval.Notes1. In smaller children, drug delivery is often a problem, with drug being wasted evenwhen using spacers. Care and time should be taken to ensure that the delivered andprescribed doses match.2. All children receiving >400mcg BDP or equivalent should have steroid impactadvice as part of a written plan.3. Doubling the ICS dose during an exacerbation is not recommended.4. Theophylline and nedocromil therapy should be considered only after workingthrough a pathway involving ICS, LABA and LTRA.5. All doses given are total daily dose.Table 6.

There should therefore be enough time to initiateappropriate action. Written personalised asthma action plans(PAAPs) can be introduced as part of a structured educationaldiscussion with a trained asthma healthcare professional. 43Key components of an asthma educational programme44are shown in Box 5, and the components of a written PAAP45are shown in Box 6. The benefits of written PAAPs as part of self management education have been found to provide improved healthoutcomes. 43,46The benefits are most noticeable for those in secondary care with moderate to severe asthma.47Therefore prior to discharge all patients should receive a written PAAP . An acuteconsultation for deteriorating asthma in any health care settingprovides an opportunity to reinforce the self management strategy. Difficult asthma, asthma exacerbations, and acute asthma Linda Pearce Difficult asthma The term 'difficult asthma' refers to patients with diagnosed asthma whose asthma-like symptoms and exacerbations persist,despite maximal treatment at step 4 or 5 of the guidelines. 48,49The factors contributing to difficult asthma and managementrecommendations are shown in Table 7. Specific patient groups There should be an awareness of the needs of certain groups ofthe population. People from certain ethnic subgroups have higherlevels of hospital admissions and exacerbations. 51Socially disadvantaged groups, adolescents and young adults are less likelyto attend for structured clinical review and are more likely to useemergency asthma healthcare services and also to have a higherreliance on bronchodilators. 1The communication difficulties with these groups should be considered when structuring educationaland self management programmes. Asthma deaths Confidential enquires into asthma deaths in the UK havedemonstrated that the majority of people who die of asthma havesevere disease and have behavioural and adverse psychosocialfactors contributing to their death. Only a minority of asthmadeaths are in patients considered to have mild or moderatelysevere disease, though sudden fatal attacks can still occur -possibly triggered by aero-allergens. 52,53Inadequate treatment, inadequate objective monitoring of asthma and follow-up review,widespread underuse of written management plans, a heavy PRIMARY CARE RESPIRATORY JOURNAL www.thepcrj.org Structured education, which may include - Nature of the disease - Nature of the treatment- How to use treatment, including inhaler technique and concordance- Identification of the areas where the patient most wants treatment to have effect - Development of self monitoring/self assessment skills - Negotiation of the personalised action plan in the light of identified patient goals - Recognition and management of acute exacerbations- Appropriate allergen or trigger avoidance Reinforcement of structured education with written personal action plan, such as the Asthma UK action plan (www.asthma.org.uk/control) The education programme may be supported with resources available from Asthma UK through their website or their Advice line (08457 010203), which includes an interpreting service.Box 5.

Individualised actions if asthma deteriorates, including: - When and how to increase medication- When to commence a reserve emergency course of oral steroids, i.e. when symptoms continue or deteriorate and/or if PEF falls to 60% of their best - If ICS treatment has been reduced or stopped the patient should be reminded to increase the dose or to restart ICS Those on low doses (e.g. 200mcg total daily dose) may be advised to increase the dose to 1,200mcg daily at the onset of deterioration. Increasing ICS dose is ineffective if already taking >400mcg total daily dose. - When and how to seek emergency help. There should be a maximum of 2-3 PEF action points. Usual points are : - PEF 80% best: - increase inhaled steroids if applicable - best: - commence oral steroids - seek urgent medical adviceBox 6: Components of a written personalised asthma action plan.1 Copyright GPIAG - reproduction prohibited http://www.thepcrj.org Copyright General Practice Airways Group Reproduction prohibitedML Levy et al. S10reliance on SABA therapy, and inappropriate prescriptions of beta- blocker therapy or heavy sedation, are all recognised contributoryfactors. 54-57Enquires have also identified a peak of asthma deaths in young people occurring in July and August, and in older peopleduring December and January. Most deaths occur beforeadmission to hospital. 54-57 At-risk registers It has been recommended that a register of patients 'at risk'should be established in general practices to identify people morelikely to die from asthma. 1,57However, further research is needed. Asthma exacerbations and acute asthma All reception staff and out-of-hours call takers should be awarethat a person with asthma complaining of respiratory symptomsneeds immediate access to a doctor or trained respiratory nurse. Itis important to treat each acute asthma consultation in the sameway as one would for acute severe asthma until reassuredotherwise. A structured clinical assessment and a standardisedrecording system are associated with favourable outcomes inacute exacerbations. 58 Assessment of acute asthma in adults The factors used to assess asthma severity in adults are as follows;Clinical features: severe breathlessness (including being toobreathless to complete sentences in one breath), tachypnoea,tachycardia, silent chest, cyanosis or collapse. None of thesesingly or together is specific and their absence does notexclude a severe attack. PEF or FEV 1: both are useful and valid measures of airway calibre. PEF is more convenient and is cheaper. PEF expressedas a percentage of the patient's previous best value is mostuseful clinically, but expressed as % predicted gives a roughguide in the absence of a known previous best value. Pulse oximetry: Measure oxygen saturation (SpO 2) with a pulse oximeter to determine the adequacy of oxygen therapy.The aim is to maintain SpO 2>92%.

The treatment pathway and the criteria for admission for adults are shown in Figure 4. Assessment of acute asthma in children aged > 2 years The clinical features for assessment of severity are shown in Table 9. In addition, the following clinical signs should be accurately recorded: Pulse rate: increasing tachycardia generally denotes worsening asthma; a fall in heart rate in life threatening asthma is a pre- terminal event Respiratory rate and degree of breathlessness: i.e. is the child too breathless to complete sentences in one breath or to feed Use of accessory muscles of respiration: best noted by observation or by palpation of neck muscles Amount of wheezing: which might become biphasic or less apparent with increasing airways obstruction. N.B. intensity ofwheezing is not a marker of severity Degree of agitation and conscious level: always give calm reassurance Clinical signs often correlate poorly with severity of obstruction.59.60Therefore, objective measurement of PEF - if the child is over the age of 5 years - and SpO 2is essential. The treatment pathway and criteria for admission for children are shown in Figure 5. Assessment of acute asthma in children aged < 2 years The assessment of acute asthma in early childhood is difficult.Most infants are audibly wheezy with intercostal recession but arenot distressed.

If in doubt give oxygen and maintainoxygen saturations of at least 92%. All adults with acute severe orlife threatening asthma should urgently receive nebulised 2- agonist bronchodilators with oxygen given at a flow rate of 6litres/min (so the oxygen cylinders need a high flow regulator. 63) For children and infants, high flow oxygen should be administered via a tight-fitting oxygen mask or at a sufficientlyhigh flow rate through nasal cannulae.In adults and children with acute asthma without life threatening features, 2-agonists can be administered by repeated activation of a pMDI via a large volume spacer, 4-10puffs given one at a time in single puffs, inhaled via tidalbreathing and repeated at intervals of 10-20 minutes. 64For children and infants, a spacer with a face mask may be used. Forall ages, oxygen, if available, should be administered betweendoses of 2-agonists. Children who do not improve after up to 10 puffs of 2- agonist should be referred to hospital.65 If a spacer is not available, an air-driven nebuliser may also be used to administer either (2.5-5mg for infantsand children) or High of 2-agonist bronchodilators may induce hypoxia due to ventilation/perfusion inadequacy.

(Focusing on children using higher dose inhalers will make this more manageable, though may miss a few using multiple doses of a low dose inhaler). 1. Calculate the percentage on high dose ICS as a proportion of all children2. Check the records of those on high dose ICS for evidence of a referral to a paediatrician Search for patients with the Read code 6637: Inhaler technique checked Identify patients noted to have 'poor' technique (say) 6-12 months ago (via computer if the assessment has been recorded) 1. Calculate the percentage with inhaler technique checked2. Check to see what action was taken (e.g. change of device (R ead code 671M), spacer provided, technique taught) and whether this had been sustained (e.g. \"still using the 'new' inhaler\"). Search for patients with an acute exacerbation (e.g Read code H333) in the last year. (or consider searching for courses of prednisolone) 1. Check the clinical entry for a clinical observation such as 'unable/able to speak in sentences, chest signs, a peak flow reading (Read code 3395), ideally compared to the patient's best PEF, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation. 2. Note whether you can decide on the severity of the attack (see Tables 8-10). If it is not clear to you, then neither will it be clear to the coroner...... Search for patients with a diagnosis of asthma (Read code H33) who have had a confinement in (say) the last year. 1. Search for those who have had an asthma review (Read codes 66YJ, 66YK, 90JA) during the course of the pregnancy. Ideally this should be shortly afterthe confirmation of the pregnancy, and should include patients who are currently asymptomatic; the severity of asthma worsens in one-third of patients Search for adults (e.g. 25-60 yrs old) diagnosed with asthma in the last year. (Read code H33) 1. Check the record for evidence that an occupational cause has been considered (e.g. the patient's job is noted, the answers to the screening questions are recorded) 2. In those in a high risk job, or where the answers to the screening questions raise the possibility of an occupational cause, check for evidence of PEF charting (Read code 663S) 3. If occupational asthma is suspected check for evidence of referral to a chest physician. 1. Search for patients who have had a discussion about self-management in the last year. (Read code 663U or 6675). (The 70% standard reflects the poorattendance at asthma reviews). 2. Check the records for evidence that a written action plan has been given. If this is not routinely recorded, then a survey of patients is needed. About a third of people with asthma have written asthma action plans so a practicalstandard has been set at 30% - in reality it should be much higher!Action As a practice, review the evidence forsafe use of ICS in children and revise(or devise) a practice policy As a practice, decide who is responsible for checking inhalertechnique and what actions they areable to take. E.g. decide who willchange the repeat prescriptions so thatthe patient does not revert to aninhaler they cannot use. There is a medico-legal, as well as a clinical imperative to record theseverity of an asthma attack. Ensure there are no practical barriers inyour practice (e.g. no PEF meter, or nomouthpieces). Consider purchasing anoximeter. Arrange a meeting to include the practice midwives and asthma nurses.Discuss the chapter on asthma inpregnancy and devise a protocol forensuring that ladies are referred for anasthma review early in their pregnancy The most likely outcome of this audit is that occupational causes are rarelyconsidered. An in-house training onoccupational asthma in order to raiseawareness may be appropriate. Arrange to discuss the outcome with the team: implementing self-management benefits from anorganisational approach. 76 Agree on the format(s) that plans will take, whowill undertake the initial self-management education and how othermembers of the team can reinforceadvice.

S14PRIMARY CARE RESPIRATORY JOURNAL www.thepcrj.orginjectable steroid is required IM or IV hydrocortisone 100mg should be administered. Soluble prednisolone should be administered in a dose of 10 mg for infants, 20mg for children 2-5 years and 30-40mg forolder children. A course of up to three days is usually sufficient. As part of the chronic asthma management plan, ICS should be continued or commenced as soon as possible whilst takingsteroid tablets. Following recovery, oral steroids can be stopped abruptly 67 provided the patient is using ICS and is not taking maintenanceoral systemic steroids. The rare exception is when oral steroidtreatment is required for three or more weeks. Review Following an exacerbation of asthma, close follow-up is essentialto ensure recovery, to elicit the reason for the exacerbation, and toexplore the use of the PAAP . For adults who have been admitted to hospital, follow-up should be arranged with the GP or asthma nurse within twoworking days following discharge from emergency departmentor hospital. A hospital specialist follow-up is often recommendedabout one month after admission. For children, the recommendations are that the child should be followed-up by their GP within a week and should be seen inthe paediatric asthma clinic within one to two months. For both adults and children, follow-up timescales should be adapted for individual patients depending on clinical,psychosocial and behavioural factors. Asthma outcomes and audit in primary care Hilary Pinnock A feature of the 2008 BTS/SIGN guideline is the inclusion of auditcriteria explicitly linked to key recommendations. 1Audit and feedback is a recognised strategy for improving the quality ofcare, 68with standards increasingly being set and monitored within healthcare systems.69 Pharmacological management The suggested audit criteria in the new guideline reflect concernsabout the side effects of high dose ICS and the benefits of add-ontherapy to improve control. 1A quarter of adults with asthma are being prescribed 'high-dose' ICS, a third with no concurrentprescription for add-on therapy, 70and 5% of children are being prescribed ICS at twice the recommended maximum dose.71The risk of adrenal suppression from excessive doses of ICS means thatsuch children should be under the care of a paediatrician. 1 Auditing patient adherence with medication is complicated. Prescribed medication may not always be dispensed, so surrogatemeasures - such as calculating the average daily dose from thetotal number of inhalers prescribed - may be used. In addition,different inhaler devices not only contain different strengths ofdrug but also different numbers of doses. Inhaler technique should be checked at every opportunity. The BTS/SIGN guideline recommends auditing the percentage ofpatients with satisfactory inhaler technique. 1However, it may be more useful to audit how often the initial prescribing of aninhaler is preceded by a check of technique so that the devicechosen is suitable for the patient from the start. Acute asthma On behalf of the GPIAG, Neville et al undertook a national audit in 1991 which identified shortcomings in primary care managementof acute asthma. 72A key issue is the lack of objective assessment of severity, which not only compromises patient safety but also hasimportant medico-legal implications. Subsequent GPIAGeducational projects have focused on these issues, 73,74and the UNSAFE audit [available from www.guideline-audit.com] is anonline resource for health professionals to evaluate their care ofpatients with uncontrolled asthma. Asthma in pregnancy Asthma treatment is safe in pregnancy and should be adjusted tomaintain optimal control. 1A simple audit in the author's practice highlighted that routine referral for an asthma review at thebeginning of pregnancy was rare, in contrast to women withdiabetes or heart disease; this resulted in a training programme formidwives and the establishment of a routine referral procedure. Asthma reviews and self-management education The UK Quality and Outcome Framework (QOF) ensures thatpractices audit the percentage of patients receiving asthmareviews 75but the content of the review varies between practices. The 2008 guideline emphasises that a key component is theprovision of a written PAAP . There is a Read code for selfmanagement education which could form the basis of an audit. Table 11 gives examples of asthma audits which can be carried out in practice, together with advice on appropriatecriteria and standards.

Diagnosis of asthma in adults and children A. A definitive diagnosis of asthma can be confirmed solely by: 1. The history 2. Examination3. Peak Flow variability 4. Spirometry 5. All of the above B. A high probability of asthma in adults is indicated by the presence of:1. Wheeze and cough 2. H/O atopic disorder 3. Unexplained low FEV 1or PEF readings 4. History of smoking 5. Unexplained peripheral blood eosinophilia C. True or false? 1. Occupational asthma is probable if someone gets respiratory symptoms when away from work 2. A child with intermediate probability of asthma may be treated with inhaled bronchodilators on a prn basis 3. In the presence of a suggestive history of asthma, the diagnosis is likely if the PEF variability is over 8% in the case oftwo readings a day 4. The Asthma Control Test is a validated test of asthma severity5. Boys are more likely to grow out of wheezing during adolescence than girls Non-pharmacological managementD. The following are useful to exclude an occupational causefor your patients' asthma:1. A job as a nurse2. No symptoms while at work.3. Normal spirometry4. No variability on PEF charting. E. The following can help reduce or prevent asthma symptoms:1. Weight reduction2. Supplementing dietary anti-oxidants.3. Breast feeding for four months4. Reducing house dust mite concentrations. Pharmacological management of chronic asthma in adults F. True or false? 1. The aim of asthma management is to obtain 'high' or 'total' control with no symptoms and no need for rescue medication 2. Stepping up treatment is considerably more important than stepping down 3. Patients at Step 1, using their SABA inhaler for prn use, should be started on ICS if they are using their SABA 1-2x/day 4. T he starting dose for ICS treatment is between 800-1000 mcg/ day (CFC-containing beclometasone equivalent) 5. There is little evidence of clinically important local or systemic side effects (except dysphonia and candidiasis) from ICS at doses of <800mcg/day (CFC-beclometasone equivalent)G. True or false?1. The add-on treatment of choice at Step 3 is theophylline2. It is safe to use LABA inhalers as sole therapy for the treatment of asthma 3. The main advantage of ICS/LABA combination inhalers is that the patient receives a dose of ICS as well as the LABA and can't receive any LABA on its own 4. The SMART regime with the combination budesonide/ formoterol inhaler is licensed for use in patients aged 12 years and over 5. Research has shown that significantly more patients obtained total control with a salmeterol/fluticasone combination inhaler compared to using fluticasone alone. Pharmacological management of chronic asthma in childrenH. True or false?1. A child using their SABA five times a week has good asthma control 2. An exacerbation of asthma in the past 2 years is a sign of poor control 3. When reviewing a child who shows poor control of asthma on SABA, ICS should be added straight away 4. Potential side effects should be considered in children taking more than 400mcg of ICS I. True or false?1. All children on 800mcg of ICS or more should hold a steroid side effect card 2. LTRAs should be the first choice of preventer therapy in children with both asthma and allergic rhinitis 3. 400mcg of generic CFC-containing BDP is the gold standard treatment for children with asthma 4. Very small children need higher doses of ICS to control their symptoms Asthma action plans and self managementJ. True or false?1. All patients should be given a written personalised asthma action asthma plan? 2. Personalised action plans should include information on: a. When and how to increase medication b. When to commence a reserve emergency course of oral steroids c. When to seek emergency help 3. Assessment of PEF should be based on the personal best PEF value within the last five years Difficult asthma, asthma exacerbations, and acute asthmaK. True or false?1. The term 'Difficult asthma' refers to all patients at step 3 and above 2. Management of acute asthma includes maintaining oxygen saturations of 90% 3. In pregnancy the management of an acute exacerbation of asthma is the same as for a non pregnant women 4. A pMDI and spacer is as effective as using a nebuliser for the administration of 2-agonist for the management of an acute exacerbation of asthma Copyright General Practice Airways Group Reproduction prohibited "}
