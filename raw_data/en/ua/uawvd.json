Acupressure for immune system Did you know that roughly 10-40% of the population suffers from allergic rhinitis aka seasonal allergies? A questions that is commonly asked is how can acupressure or acupuncture help the immune system to curb seasonal allergies? What is the difference? Acupressure is a where gentle pressure is applied at certain acupuncture point locations while acupuncture involves the stimulation of areas with acupuncture needles. Commonly allergic rhinitis is caused by a histamine response in the body which leads to those allergy symptoms of itchy eyes, runny nose, and sneezing. Finding ways to help curb that response aka ant-histamines can be beneficial in reducing symptoms. Common points to help seasonal allergies There are several acupressure points on the body that can help allergic rhinitis and boost the immune system. Common points are: LI10 and LI11. LI 11 is located at the outer end of the elbow crease. It is known to benefit the immune system, relieves cold symptoms, and local elbow pain. LI10 is located about 1 inch from LI11 towards the wrist. It functions to also strengthen the immune system and help regulate digestion. How to use the points Gently press or rub the 2 point locations on both arms. You can do this for a couple minutes, several times a day. This is great to do to help prevent getting sick, not just while you are sick. What do the studies say? In a recent study in the journal Clinical Otolaryngology, looked at how ear acupressure could help allergic rhinitis. They reviewed over ninety studies and found that both ear-acupressure and body acupuncture could provide antihistamine benefits for both short and long-term effects.
