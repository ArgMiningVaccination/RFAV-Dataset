INTRODUCTION In manufacturing veterinary vaccine, overall control is essential to ensure that consumers receive vaccine of high quality. Hazard operations in the manufacture of substances that may be necessary to sav e lives or to restore or preserve health cannot be permitted. The quality of veterinary vaccines depends on the starting materials, manufacturing process, building/ facilities, equipment and also personne l involved. All veterinary vaccines should be manufactured under carefully controlled and monitored conditions, and sole reliance should be placed on any test for assurance of the quality of the finished product. Veterinary vaccines may be prepared as live or inactivated (killed) products. Both live and inactivated vaccines may be formulated with adjuvants to enhance their efficacy. When vaccines are used, successful performance requires that they be produced in a manner that ensures a uniform and consistent product of high quality. The implementation of GMP Guidelines will ensure the qual ity of products in the market that will protect the public against risk of buying and using substandard product s. It will also encourage all parties involved in the manufa cture of animal vaccines to enhance and apply quality standards. To reliably achieve the quality objectives there must be comprehensively designed and correctly implemented system s of Quality Assur ance incorporating GMP, Quality Control and Quality Risk M anagement. These systems should be fully documented and their effectiveness monitored. II. DEFINITION The following definitions are adopted: 1. Animal Facilities Quarters for animals used in production and control of biological (vaccine) products (used for quality control and safety testing) should be separated from production and control areas and be suitably designed. 2. Audit ( Internal and External ) Auditing is a systematic process of objectively obtaining and evaluating evidence regarding p ersonnel, premise s, equipment, documentation, production, quality control, distribution of the medicinal products, arrangements for dealing with complaints and recalls, inspection of facilities, functions, or records. 3. Authorized person The person recognized by the nationa l regulatory authority as having the responsibility for ensuring that each batch of finished product has been 2 manufactured, tested and approved for release in compliance with the laws and regulations. 4. Batch (Lot) A defined quantity of starting material, p ackaging material or product processed in one process or series of processes so that it could be expected to be homogeneous. Note: To complete certain stages of manufacture, it may be necessary to divide a batch into a number of sub- batches, which are later brought together to form a final homogeneous batch. In the case of continuous manufacture, the batch must correspond to a defined fraction of the production, characterised by its intended homogeneity. For control of the finished product, a batch of a proprietary medicinal product comprises all the units of a pharmaceutical form which are made from the same initial mass of material and have undergone a single series of manufacturing operations or a single sterilisation operation or, in the case of a continuous production process, all the units manufactured in a given period of time. 5. Batch Number (Lot N umber ) A distinctive combination of numbers and/or letters that specifically identifies a batch on the labels, its batch records and corresponding certifi cates of analysis, etc. 6.

Calibration The set of operations that establish, under specified conditions, the relationship between values indicated by an instrument or system for measuring, recording, and controlling, or the values represented by a material measure, and the corresponding known values of a reference standard. Limits for acceptance of the results of measuring should be established. 10. Contamination The undesired introduction of impurities of a chemical or microbiological nature, or of foreign matter, into or on to a starting material or intermediate during production, sampling, packaging or repackaging, storage or transport. 11. Cross -contamination Contamination of a starting material, intermediate product or finished product with another starting material or product during production. 12. Documentation All written data on suppliers, producers, instructions and records involved in the manufacture of veterinary vaccines. 3 13. Final Product (Finished Product) A medicinal product that has undergone all stages of production, including packaging in it s final container and labelling . 14. In Process Control Checks performed during production in order to monitor and, if necessary, to adjust the process to ensure that the product conforms to specification. The control of the environment or equipment may also be regarded as a part of in - process control. 15.

Retained Sample Sufficient representative samples of each batch of final products which are retained and stored in accordance with the guide. The container used for storage should be composed of the same material as the market primary container in which the product is marketed 30. Sanitation Hygiene control on manufacturing and material handling (from starting materials to finished product). 31. Seed Management (Master and Working Seed) Seed lo t system: A seed lot system is a system according to which successive batches of a product are derived from the same master seed lot at a given passage level. For routine production, a working seed lot is prepared from the master seed lot. The final produc t is derived from the working seed lot and has not undergone more passages from the master seed lot than the vaccine shown in clinical studies to be satisfactory with respect to safety and efficacy. The origin and the passage history of the master seed lot and the working seed lot are recorded. Master seed lot: A culture of a micro -organism distributed from a single bulk into containers in a single operation in such a manner as to ensure uniformity, to prevent contamination and to ensure stability. A maste r seed lot in liquid form is usually stored at or below - 70 0C.

Vaccine Vigilance ( Post Licensing Monitoring ) A reliable system to identify, at the earliest stage, any serious problems encountered from the use of veterinary vaccines and should be ongoing and an integral part of all regulatory programs for veterinary vaccines, especially live vaccines. 39. Validation Action of proving, in accordance with the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice, that any procedure, process, equipment, material, activity or system actually leads to the expected results III. ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE 1. Manufacturers of veterinary vaccine products must have in place a quality assurance system to ensure that finished products are fit for their intended use, comply with registration requirements and do not place treated animals or users at risk due to inadequate quality, safety or efficacy. The basic concepts of Quality Assurance, Good Manufacturing Practices, Quality Control and Quality Risk Management are inter -related aspects of Quality Management. The basic elements of the quality management are: a. An appropriate infrastructure or quality system encompassing the organizational structure, procedures, processes and resources; and b.

Self-inspection results; b. Evaluation and conclusions; c. Recommended corrective actions. B. Quality A udit/ External Audit 1. It may be useful to supplement self inspections with quality audit. A quality audit consists of an examination and assessment of all or part of a quality management system with specific purpose of improving it. 2. A quality audit is usual ly conducted by external or independent specialist or a team designated by the management for this purpose. 3. Such audits may also be extended to suppliers and contactors (see contract manufacture) . C. Supplier's Audit and Approval 1. The person responsible for Quality Management (Quality Assurance) should have responsible together with other relevant departments for approving suppliers who can reliably supply starting and packaging materials that meet established specifications. 2. A list of approved suppliers of starting and packaging materials should be established and reviewed. 3. Before suppliers are approved and included in the approved suppliers list or specifications, they should be evaluated. The evaluation should take into account a supplier's history and t he nature of the materials to be supplied. 4. All established suppliers should be evaluated regularly. XIII. CONTRACT MANUFACTURE 1. Contract manufacture must be correctly defined, agreed and controlled in order to avoid misunderstandings which could result in pr oduct or work of unsatisfactory quality. 2. There must be a written and signed contract between Contract Giver and The Contract Acceptor which clearly establish the duties of each party. 3. The Contract Giver a. Responsible for assessing the competence of the Contract Acceptor . Audits of contract acceptor/ manufacturer by the contract giver should be carried out to ensure that work is carried out to requirement in accordance with GMP. The depth and frequency of inspections should be determined on a risk manage ment basis. b. Provide the Contract Acceptor with all the information necessary to carry out the contracted operations correctly in accordance with the marketing authorization and any other legal requirements. c. Ensure that the Contract Acceptor is fully awa re of any problem associated with the product or the work or tests which might pose a hazard to his premises, equipment, personnel, other materials or other products. 23 d. Ensure that all processed product s and materials delivered by the Contract Acceptor com ply with their specifications or that the products have been released by the authorized person. 4. The Contract Acceptor a. Must have adequate premises and equipment, knowledge and experience, and competent personnel to carry out satisfactory the work ordered by the Contract Giver. Contract manufacture may be undertaken only by manufacture holding GMP certificate. b. Ensure that all products or materials delivered to him are suitable for their intended purpose. c. The contract acceptor should not pass to a third party of the work entrusted to him under the contract without the Contract Giver's prior evaluation and approval. d. Arrangements made between the contract acceptor and any third party should ensure that the manufacturing and analytical information is made available in the same way as between the original Contract Giver and Contract Acceptor. e. The contract acceptor should refrain fro m any activities which may adversely affect the quality of the products manufactured for the Contract Giver. 5. The Contract a. A co ntract should be drawn up between the Contract Giver and the Contact Acceptor which specifies their respective responsibilities relating to the manufacture and control of the product. It should also defined the GMP responsibilities of each party for each aspects of the work. All GMP agreement should be kept up- to-date. b. Technical aspects of the contract should be drawn up by competent persons suitably knowledge able in vaccine technology, analysis and GMP. c. All arrangements for manufacture and analysis must be in accordance with the marketing authorization and agreed by both party. d. The contract should permit the Contract Giver to visit the facilities of the Contract Acceptor e. Arrangement for contracted steps of manufacture must not compromise the quality of the product. f. The contract should specify the way in which the authorized person (e.g Head of Quality Management/ Quality Assurance) releasing the batch for sale ensures that each batch has been manufactured and checked for compliance with the requireme nts of marketing authorization. g. The contract should describe clearly who responsible for purchasing materials, testing and releasing materials, undertaking production and quality controls, including in- process controls, and who has responsibility for sam pling and analysis. h. Manufacturing, analytical and distribution records, and reference samples should be kept by, or be available to, the Contract Giver. Any records relevant to assessing the quality of a product in the event of complaints or suspected defect must be accessible and specified in the defect/recall procedures of the Contract Giver. 24 i. Where a contractor authorized to manufacture under the license of another manufacturer, the license holder must exert direct control and oversight of the quality management of the contracted steps. j. The contract should describe the handling of starting materials, packaging materials, intermediate and bulk products and finished products if they are rejected. It should also describe the procedure to be followed if t he contract analysis shows that the tested product must be rejected. XIV. QUALIFICATION AND VALIDATION 1. Manufacturers should identify what validation work is needed to prove control of the critical aspects of their particular operations. 2. Significant changes to the facilities, the equipment and the processes, which may affect the quality of the vaccine, should be validated. 3. A risk assessment approach should be used to determine the scope and extend of validation. 4. Planning For Validation a. All validations a ctivities should be planned b. The key elements of a validation programme should be clearly defined and documented in a Validation Master Plan (VMP) or equivalent document. c. The VMP should contain data on at least the following: - validation policy - organizationa l structure of validation activities - summary of facilities, systems, equipment and processes to be validated - change control - reference to exiting documents 5. Documentation a. A written SOP should be established that specifies how qualification and validation wi ll be conducted. The SOP should be reviewed and approved by Quality Assurance Manager b. A report should be prepared, summarizing the result obtained, commenting on any deviations observed, and drawing the necessary conclusions, including recommending changes to correct deficiencies. 6. Qualification a. Design Qualification - The first element of the validation of new facilities, systems or equipment could be design qualification (DQ). - DQ should be compliance with GMP, and should be demonstrated and documented. b. Installation Qualification - Installation Qualification (IQ) should be performed on new or modified facilities, systems and equipment c. Operational Qualification - Operational Qualification (OQ) is performed after IQ has been completed, reviewed and approved. 25 - OQ a t least should included: tests that have been developed from knowledge of processes, systems, and equipment; test to include as \"worst case\" condition. - The completion of a successful OQ should allow the finalization of calibration, operating and cleaning procedures, operator training and preventive maintenance requirement. It should permit a formal \"release\" of the facilities, systems and equipment. d. Performance Qualification - Performance qualification (PQ) is performed after both IQ and OQ have been completed, reviewed and approved. - PQ at least should included: tests using production materials, qualified substitutes or simulated product, that have been developed from knowledge of the process and the facilities, systems or equipment; - In some cases, PQ may be appropriate to perform it in conjunction with OQ. e. Qualification of Established Facilities, System and Equipment - Evidence should be available to support and verify the operating parameters and limits for the critical variables of the operating equipment. - The calibration, cleaning, preventive maintenance, operating procedures and operator training procedures and records should be documented. 7. Process Validation a. Process validation should normally be completed prior to the distribution and sale of the vaccine (prospective validation). In exceptional circumstances, where this is not possible, it may be necessary to validate processes during routine production (concurrent validation). Processes in use for some time should also be validated (retrospective validat ion) b. Facilities, systems, and equipment to be used should have been qualified and analytical testing methods should be validated. c. Staff taking part in the validation work should have been appropriately trained. d. Facilities, systems, equipment and process sh ould be periodically evaluated to verify that they are still operating in a valid manner. 8. Cleaning Validation a. The objective of validation of cleaning procedure is in order to confirm the effectiveness of cleaning procedure. b. Validated analytical method hav ing sensitivity to detect residues or contaminants should be used. c. Typically three consecutive applications of the cleaning procedure should be performed and show to be successful in order to prove that the cleaning procedure is validated. 9. Validation of Analytical Procedures a. The objective of validation of an analytical procedure is to demonstrate that it is suitable for its intended purpose. b. The objective of the analytical procedure should be clearly understood since this will govern the validation chara cteristics which should be considered are listed below: - accuracy; - precision; - intermediate precision; detection limit; - quantitation limit; - linearity; and - range. 10. Change Control a. Written procedures should be in place to describe the actions to be taken if a change is proposed to a starting material, products component, process equipment, process environment (or site), method of production or testing or any other that may affect vaccine quality or reproducibility of the process. b. All changes that m ay affect product quality or reproducibility of the process should be formally requested, documented and accepted. c. The likely impact of the change of the facilities, systems and equipment on the product should be evaluated, including risk analysis. 11. Re-Validation a. Facilities, systems, equipment and processes, should be periodically evaluated to confirm they remain valid. b. Where no significant changes have been made to the validated status, a review with evidence that facilities, systems, equipment, processes and analytical method meet the prescribed requirements fulfils the need for re-validation.

(2) Raw materials may not be brought into production areas while under quarantine. Sterile materials that require sampling should be sampled in a testing area if sterility of the raw mate rial is required for sterility of final product. (3) The use of surrounding areas of Grade C or higher is recommended for open manipulation of seeds. (4) The use of open systems for replication of production microorganisms is discouraged due to the lack of control it offers. However, with the use of highly selective media or other growth conditions that limit the growth of contaminating microorganisms, some manu facturer may choose to continue this practice. (5) Final filling bulks are often closed but not fully sealed , such as during the use of screw cap bottles. Additional protection for this such closure may be necessary during transport through uncontrolled areas. (6) The carts utilized for this transfer may not be the same as those used to transfer from filling to lyo philization within the Grade B surround. (7) Vial capping can be undertaken as an aceptic process using sterilized caps or as a clean process outside the aseptic core. Vi als should be protected by Grade A conditions up to the point of leaving the aseptic proc essing area and thereafter stoppered vials should be protected with a Grade A air supply until the cap has been crimped. (8) Due to the pharmacopoeial sterility test requirement, at least Grade B dynamic (in operation) limits should be met in both st atic and dynamic conditions. (9) Due to the presence of formulations promoting the stability of viable microorganisms, at least Grade B dynamic (in operation) limits should be limits should be met in both static and dynamic conditions. (10) Depending on the design and histo rical state of control of the surrounding area, Grade B (dynamic) limits may be accepted for area qualification during both static and dynamic conditions (11) National regulatory agencies may accept specialized procedures for seasonal or pandemic influenza vacc ines 33 APPENDIX III VETERINARY VACCINE* *Vaccines for Veterinary Use, Ph Eur monograph 0062, 2010 in British Pharmacopoeia (Veterinary) 2012 Vaccines for veterinary use are preparations containing antigenic substances and are administered for the purpose of inducing a specific and active immunity against disease provoked by bacteria, toxins, viruses, fungi or parasites. The vaccines, live or inactivated, confer active immunity that may be transferred passively via maternal antibodies against the immuno gens they contain and sometimes also against antigenically -related organisms. Vaccines may contai n bacteria, toxins, viruses or fungi, living or inactivated, parasites, or antigenic fr actions or substances produced by these organisms and rendered harmless whilst retaining all or part of their antigenic properties; vaccines may also contain combinations of these constituents. The antigens may be produced by recombinant DNA technology. Suitable adjuvants may be included to enhance the immunising properties of the vaccines. I. BACTERIAL VACCINES AND BACTERIAL TOXOIDS 1. Bacterial vaccines and bacterial toxoids are prepared from cultures grown on suitable solid or liquid media, or by other suitable means; the requirements of this section do not apply to ba cterial vaccines prepared in cell cultures or in live animals. The strain of bacterium used may have been modified by genetic engineering. The identity, antigenic potency and purity of each bacterial culture used are carefully controlled. 2. Bacterial vacci nes contain inactivated or live bacteria or their antigenic components; they are liquid preparations of various degrees of opacity or they may be freeze -dried. 3. Bacterial toxoids are prepared from toxins by diminishing their toxicity to a very low level o r by completely eliminating it by physical or chemical means whilst retaining adequate immunising potency. The toxins are obtained from selected strains of specified micro -organisms grown in suitable media or are obtained by other suitable means, for exam ple, chemical synthesis. 4. The toxoids may be: - liquid; - precipitated with alum or another suitable agent; - purified and/or adsorbed on aluminium phosphate, aluminium hydroxide, calcium phosphate or another adsorbent prescribed in the monograph. 5. Bacterial toxoids are clear or slightly opalescent liquids. Adsorbed toxoids are suspensions or emulsions. Certain toxoids may be freeze -dried. 6. Unless otherwise indicated, statements and requirements given below for bacterial vaccines apply equally to b acterial vaccines, bacterial toxoids and products containing a combination of bacterial cells and toxoid. II. VIRAL VACCINES 1. Viral vaccines are prepared by growth in suitable cell cultures (5.2.4) , in tissues, in micro -organisms, in fertilised egg s or, where no other possibility is available, in live 34 animals, or by other suitable means. The strain of virus used may have been modified by genetic engineering. They are liquid or freeze -dried preparations of one or more viruses or viral subunits or peptides. 2. Live viral vaccines are prepared from viruses of attenuated virulence or of natural low virulence for the target species. 3. Inactivated viral vaccines are treated by a validated procedure for inactivation of the virus and may be purified and concentrated. III. VECTOR VACCINES Vector vaccines are liquid or freeze- dried preparations of one or more types of live micro -organisms (bacteria or viruses) that are non -pathogenic or have low pathogenicity for the target species and in which h ave been inserted one or more genes encoding antigens that stimulate an immune response protective against other micro -organisms. IV. PRODUCTION A. PREPARATION OF THE VACCINE 1. The methods of preparation, which vary according to the type of vaccine, are s uch as to maintain the identity and immunogenicity of the antigen and to ensure freedom from contamination with extraneous agents. 2. Substances of animal origin and other substances used in the production of vaccines for veterinary use must comply with the requirements. 3. All materials prepared in a manner that avoids contamination of the vaccine. A.1. Substrates for production 1. Cell cultures used in the production of vaccines for veterinary use comply with the requirements. 2. Where a documents refers t o chicken flocks free from specified pathogens (SPF), these flocks comply with the requirements. 3. For production of inactivated vaccines, where vaccine organisms are grown in poultry embryos, such embryos are derived either from SPF flocks or from healthy non-SPF flocks free from the presence of certain agents and their antibodies, as specified in the document. It may be necessary to demonstrate that the inactivation process is effective against specified potential contaminants. For the production of a mas ter seed lot and for all passages of a micro -organism up to and including the working seed lot eggs from SPF flocks are used. 4. Where it is unavoidable to use animals or animal tissues in the production of veterinary vaccines, such animals shall be free fro m specified pathogens, as appropriate to the source species and the target animal for the vaccine. A.2. Media used for seed culture preparation and for production 1. At least the qualitative composition must be recorded of media used for seed culture pr eparation and for production. The grade of each named ingredient is specified. Where media or ingredients are claimed as proprietary, this is indicated and an appropriate description recorded. Ingredients that are derived from animals are specified as to the source species and country of origin, and must comply with the requirements. Preparation processes for media used, including sterilization procedures, are documented. 35 2. The addition of antibiotics during the manufacturing process is normally restricted to cell culture fluids and other media, egg inocula and material harvested from skin or other tissues. A.3. Seed lots 1. Bacterial seed lots General requirements The genus and species (and varieties where appropriate) of the bacteria used in the vaccine are stated. Bacteria used in manufacture are handled in a seed - lot system wherever possible. Each master seed lot is tested as described below. A record of the origin, date of isolation, passage history (including purification and characterisation procedures) and storage conditions is maintained for each master seed lot. Each master seed lot is assigned a specific code for identification purposes. Propagation The minimum and maximum number of subcultures of each master seed lot prior to the production stage are specified. The methods used for the preparation of seed cultures, preparation of suspensions for seeding, techniques for inoculation of seeds, titre and concentration of inocula and the media used, are documented. It shall be demonstrated tha t the characteristics of the seed material (for example, dissociation or antigenicity) are not changed by these subcultures. The conditions under which each seed lot is stored are documented. Identity and purity Each master seed lot is shown to contain only the species and strain of bacterium stated. A brief description of the method of identifying each strain by biochemical, serological and morphological characteristics and distinguishing it as far as possible from related strains is recorded, as is also the method of determining the purity of the strain. If the master seed lot is shown to contain living organisms of any kind other than the species and strain stated, then it is unsuitable for vaccine production. 2. Virus seed lots General requirements Viruses used in manufacture are handled in a seed- lot system. Each master seed lot is tested as described below. A record of the origin, date of isolation, passage history (including purification and characterisation procedures) and storage conditions is m aintained for each seed lot. Each master seed lot is assigned a specific code for identification purposes. Production of vaccine is not normally undertaken using virus more than 5 passages from the master seed lot. In the tests on the master seed lot descr ibed below, the organisms used are not normally more than 5 passages from the master seed lot at the start of the tests, unless otherwise indicated. Where the master seed lot is contained within a permanently infected master cell seed, the following tests are carried out on an appropriate volume of virus from disrupted master cell seed. Where relevant tests have been carried out on disrupted cells to validate the suitability of the master cell seed, these tests need not be repeated. Propagation 36 The master seed lot and all subsequent passages are propagated on cells, on embryonated eggs or in animals that have been shown to be suitable for vaccine production, and, where applicable, using substances of animal origin that meet the requirements. Identification A suitable method to identify the vaccine strain and to distinguish it as far as possible from related strains must be used. Bacteria and fungi The master seed lot complies with the test for sterility Mycoplasmas The master seed lot complies with the test for mycoplasmas (culture method and indicator cell culture method). Absence of extraneous viruses Monographs may contain requirements for freedom from extraneous agents, otherwise the requirements stated below apply. 3. Preparations of monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies containing high levels of neutralising antibody to the virus of the seed lot are made on a batch basis, using antigen that is not derived from any passage level of the virus isolate giving rise to the master seed virus. Each batch of serum is maintained at 56\u00b0C for 30 min to inactivate complement. Each batch is shown to be free of antibodies to potential contaminants of the seed virus and is shown to be free of any non- specific inhibiting effects on the abilit y of viruses to infect and propagate within cells (or eggs, where applicable). If such a serum cannot be obtained, other methods are used to remove or neutralise the seed virus specifically. 4. If the seed lot virus would interfere with the conduct and sensitivity of a test for extraneous viruses, a sample of the master seed lot is treated with a minimum amount of the monoclonal or polyclonal antibody so that the vaccine virus is neutralised as far as possible or removed. The final virus - serum mixture s hall, if possible, contain at least the virus content of 10 doses of vaccine per 0.1 mL for avian vaccines and per millilitre for other vaccines. For mammalian vaccines, the seed lot or the mixture of seed lot and antiserum is tested for freedom from ex traneous agents as follows: - The mixture is inoculated onto cultures of at least 70 cm 2 of the required cell types. - The cultures may be inoculated at any suitable stage of growth up to 70% confluency. - At least 1 monolayer of each type must be retained as a control. The cultures must be monitored daily for a week. - At the end of this period the cultures are freeze thawed 3 times, centrifuged to remove cell debris and re- inoculated onto the same cell type as above. This is repeated twice. The final passa ge must produce sufficient cells in appropriate vessels to carry out the tests below. - Cytopathic and haemadsorbing agents are tested for using the methods described in the relevant sections on testing cell cultures and techniques such as immuno- fluorescen ce are used for detection of specific 37 contaminants for the tests in cell cultures. The master seed lot is inoculated onto: primary cells of the species of origin of the virus; cells sensitive to viruses pathogenic for the species for which the vaccine is intended; cells sensitive to pestiviruses. - If the master seed lot is shown to contain living organisms of any kind, other than the virus of the species and strain stated, or foreign viral antigens, then it is unsuitable for vaccine production. A.4 Inactivation Inactivated vaccines are subjected to a validated inactivation procedure. The testing of the inactivation kinetics described below is carried out once for a given production process. The rest of this section applies to each production run. When conducting tests for inactivation, it is essential to take account of the possibility that under the conditions of manufacture, organisms may be physically protected from inactivant. a. Inactivation kinetics The inactivating agent and the inactiv ation procedure shall be shown, under conditions of manufacture, t o inactivate the vaccine micro -organism. Adequate data on inactivation kinetics shall be obtained. Normally, the time required for inactivation shall be not more than 67% of the duration of the inactivation process. b. Aziridine If an aziridine compound is used as the inactivating agent then it shall be shown that no inactivating agent remains at the end of the inactivation procedure. This may be accomplished by neutralising the inactivating agent with thiosulfate and demonstrat ing residual thiosulfate in the inactivated harvest at the completion of the inactivation procedure. c. Formaldehyde If formaldehyde is used as the inactivating agent, then a test for free formaldehyde is carried out as prescribed under Tests. d. Other inactivating agents When other inactivation methods are used, appropriate tests are carried out to demonstrate that the inactivating agent has been removed or reduced to an acceptable residual level. e. Residual live virus/bacteria and/or detoxification testing A test for complete inactivation and/or detoxification is performed immediately after the inactivation and/or detoxification procedure and, if applicable, the neutralisation or removal of the inactivating or detoxifying agent. e.1 Bacterial vaccines The test selected shall be appropriate to the vaccine bacteria being used and shall consist of at least 2 passages in production medium or, if solid medium has been used for production, in a suitable liquid medium or in the medium prescribed in the monograph. The product complies with the test if no evidence of any live micro -organism is observed. e.2 Bacterial toxoids. 38 The test selected shall be appropriate to the toxin or toxins present and shall be the most sensitive available. e.3 Vi ral vaccines - The test selected shall be appropriate to the vaccine virus being used and must consist of at least 2 passages in cells, embryonated eggs or, where no other suitably sensitive method is available, in animals. - The quantity of cell samples, eg gs or animals shall be sufficient to ensure appropriate sensitivity of the test. - For tests in cell cultures, not less than 150 cm2 of cell culture monolayer is inoculated with 1.0 mL of inactivated harvest. - The product complies with the test if no eviden ce of the presence of any live virus or other micro- organism is observed. The final bulk vaccine is prepared by combining one or more batches of antigen that comply with all the relevant requirements with any auxiliary substances, such as adjuvants, stabilisers, antimicrobial preservatives and diluents. B. CHOICE OF VACCINE COMPOSITION AND CHOICE OF VACCINE STRAIN For the choice of vaccine composition and choice of vaccine strain, important aspects to be evaluated include safety, efficacy and stability. These requirements may be made more explicit or supplemented by the requirements of specific documents. For live vaccines, a maximum virus titre or bacterial count acceptable from the point of view of safety is established during development studies. This is then used as the maximum acceptable titre for each batch of vaccine at release. B.1 Potency and immunogenicity The tests given under the headings Potency and Immunogenicity serve 2 purposes: - the potency tests establishes, by a well -controlled test in experimental conditions, the minimum acceptable vaccinating capacity for all vaccines within the scope of the definition, which must be guaranteed throughout the period of validity; - well-controlled experimental studies are normally a part of the overall demonstration of efficacy of a vaccine the test referred to immunogenicity suitable as a part of this testing. B.2 Route of administration During development of a vaccine, safety and immunogenicity are demonstrated for each route of administration to be recommended. The following is a non-exhaustive list of such routes of administration: - intramuscular; - subcutaneous; - intravenous; - ocular; 39 - wing web; - intradermal; - intraperitoneal; - in ovo. B.3 Methods of administration During development of a vaccine, safety and immunogenicity are demonstrated for each method of administration to be recommended. The following is a non- exhaustive list of such methods of administration: - injection; - drinking w ater; - - scarification; - implantation; - immersion. B.4 Categories of animal Sometimes the test is to be carried out for each category of animal of the target species for which the product is recommended or is to be recommended. The following is a non- exhaustive list of categories that are to be taken into account. Mammals : - pregnant animals/non- pregnant animals; - animals raised primarily for breeding/animals raised primarily for food production; - animals of the minimum age or size r ecommended for vaccination. Avian species : - birds raised primarily for egg production/birds raised primarily for production of meat; - birds before point of lay/birds after onset of lay. Fish: - broodstock fish/fish raised for food production. B.5 preservatives a. Antimicrobial preservatives are used to prevent spoilage or adverse effects caused by microbial contamination occurring during use of a vaccine which is expected to be no longer than 10 h after first broaching. Ant imicrobial preservatives are not included in freeze- dried products but, if justified, t aking into account the maximum recommended period of use after reconstitution, they may be included in the diluent for multi -dose freeze- dried products. b. For single -dose liquid preparations, inclusion of antimicrobial preservatives is not acceptable unless justified and authorised, but may be acceptable, for example where the same vaccine is filled in single- dose and multidose containers and is used in non- food- produci ng species. c. For multidose liquid preparations, the need for effective antimicrobial preserv ation is evaluated taking into account likely contamination during use and the maximum recommended period of use after broaching of the container. 40 d. During development studies the effectiveness of the antimicrobial preservative throughout the period of validity shall be demonstra ted to the satisfaction of the competent authority. e. The efficacy of the antimicrobial preservative is evaluated and in addition samples are t ested at suitable intervals over the proposed in- use shelf -life. If neither the A criteria nor the B criteria can be met, then in justified cases the following criteria are applied to vaccines for veterinary use: bacteria, no increase from 24 h to 7 day s, 3 log reduction at 14 days, no increase at 28 days; fungi, no increase at 14 days and 28 days. f. Addition of antibiotics as antimicrobial preservative is generally not acceptable. B.6 Stability a. Evidence of stability is obtained to justify the proposed period of validity. This evidence takes the form of the results of virus titrations, bacterial counts or potency tests carried out at regular intervals until 3 months beyond the end of the shelf life on not fewer than 3 representative consecutive batches of vaccine kept under recommended storage conditions together with results from studies of moisture content (for freeze -dried products), physical tests on the adjuvant, chemical tests on substances such as the adjuvant constituents and preservati ves, and pH, as appropriate. b. Where applicable, studies on the stability of the reconstituted vaccine are carried out, using the product reconstituted in accordance with the proposed recommendations. C. MANUFACTURER'S TESTS Certain tests may be carr ied out on the final bulk vaccine rather than on the batch or batches prepared from it; such tests include those for antimicrobial preservatives, free formaldehyde and the potency determination for inactivated vaccines. C.1 Residual live virus/bacteri a and/or detoxification testing a. For inactivated vaccines, where the auxiliary substances would interfere with a test for inactivation and/or detoxification, a test for inactivatio n or detoxification is carried out during preparation of the final bulk, aft er the different batches of antigen have been combined but before addition of auxiliary substances; the test for inactivation or detoxification may then be omitted on the final bulk and the batch. b. Where there is a risk of reversion to toxicity, the test for detoxification performed at the latest stage of the production process at which the sensitivity of the test is not compromised (e.g. after the different batches of antigen have been combined but before the addition of auxiliary substances) is importa nt to demonstrate a lack of reversion to toxicity. C.3 Batch potency test a. For most vaccines, the tests cited under Potency or I mmunogenicity are not suitable for the routine testing of batches. b. For live vaccines, the minimum acceptable virus titre or bacterial count that gives satisfactory results in the potency test and other e fficacy studies is established during development. For routine testing it must be demonstrated 41 for each batch that the titre or count at release is such that at the end of th e period of validity, in the light of stability studies, the vaccine, stored in the recomm ended conditions, will contain not less than the minimum acceptable virus titre or bac terial count determined during development studies. c. For inactivated vaccines, i f the test described under Potency is not used for routine testing, a batch potency test is established duri ng development. The aim of the batch potency test is to ensure that each batch of va ccine would, if tested, comply with the test described under Pot ency and Immunogenicity. The acceptance criteria for the batch potency test are therefore established by correlation with the test described under Potency. Where a batch potency test is described in a monograph, this is given as an example of a test that i s considered suitable, after establishment of correlation with the potency test; other test models can also be used. Batch a. Unless otherwise prescribed in the monograph, the final bulk vaccine is distributed aseptically into sterile, tamper -proof containers which are then closed so as to exclude contamination. b. Only a batch that complies with each of the requirem ents given below under 3 Batch tests or in the relevant individual monograph may be released for use. With the agreement of the competent au thority, certain of the batch tests may be omitted where in -process tests give an equal or better guarant ee that the batch would comply or where alternative tests validated with respect to the Pharmacopoeia method have been carried out. c. The identificatio n test can often be conveniently c ombined with the batch potency test to avoid unnecessary use of animals. For a given vaccine, a validated in vitro test can be used to avoid the unnecessary use of animals. d. It is recognised that for an established vaccin e the routine appli cation of the safety test will be waived by the competent authority in the inte rests of animal welfare when a sufficient number of consecutive production batche s have been produced and found to comply with the test, thus demonstrating co nsistency of the manufacturing process. Significant changes to the manufacturing process may require resumption of routine testing to re -establish consistency. The number of consecutive batches to be tested depends on a number of factors such as the type of vaccine, the frequency of production of batches and experience with the vaccine during development safety testing and during application of the batch safety test. Without prejudice to the decision of the competent authority in the light of inf ormation available for a given vaccine, testing of 10 consecutive batches is likely to be sufficient for most products. For products with an inherent safety risk, it m ay be necessary to continue to conduct the safety test on each batch. Animal tests Tests must be carried out in such a way a s to use the minimum number of animals and to cause the least pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm. The criteria for judging tests in monographs must be applied in light of this. For example, if it is indica ted that an animal is considered to be positive, infected etc. when typical clinical signs occur then as soon as it is clear that result will not be affected the animal in question shall be either euthanised or given suitable treatment to prevent unnece ssary suffering. Alternative test methods may be used to demonstrate compliance and the use of such 42 tests is particularly encouraged when this leads to replacement or reduction of animal use or reduction of suffering. Physical tests A vaccine with an oily adjuvant is tested for viscosity by a suitable method and shown to be within the limits set for the product. The stability of the emulsion shall be demonstrated. Chemical tests Tests for the concentrations of appropriate subst ances such as aluminium and preservatives are carried out to show that these are within the limits set for the product. pH The pH of liquid products and diluents is measured and shown to be within the limits set for the product. Water Where applicable, the freeze- drying process is checked by a determination of water and shown to be within the limits set for the product. V. BATCH TESTS All hen eggs, chickens and chicken cell cultures for use in quality control tests s hall be derived from an SPF flock. 1. Identification For inactivated vaccines, the identification prescrib ed in monographs is usually an antibody induction test since this is applicable to all vaccines. 2. Formaldehyde Where formaldehyde has been used in the preparat ion, the c oncentration of free formaldehyde is not greater than 0.5 g/L, unless a higher amount has been shown to be safe. 3. Phenol When the vaccine contains phenol, the concentration is not greater than 5 g/L. 4. Sterility - Vaccines comply with the test for steril ity. Where the volume of liquid in a container is greater than 100 mL, the method of membrane filtration is used wherever possible. Where the method of membrane filtration cannot be used, the method of direct inoculation may be used. Where the volume of l iquid in each container is at least 20 mL, the minimum volume to be used for each culture medium is 10% of the contents or 5 mL, whichever is less. The appropriate number of items to be tested is 1% of the batch with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 10. - For live bacterial and for live fungal vaccines, the absence of micro -organisms other than the vaccine strain is demonstrated by suitable methods such as microscopic examination and inoculation of suitable media. - For avian live viral vaccines, for non- paren teral use only, the requirement for sterility is usually replaced by requirements for absence of pathogenic micro - organisms and for a maximum of 1 non- pathogenic micro- organism per dose. 5. Extraneous agents These measures include: - production within a seed -lot system and a cell -seed system, wherever possible; 43 - extensive testing of seed lots and cell seed for extraneous agents; - requirements for SPF flocks used for providing substrates for vaccine production; - testing of substances of animal origin, which must, wherever possible, undergo an inactivation procedure; - for live vaccines, testing of the final product for infectious extraneous agents; such tests are less extensive than those carried out at earlier stages because of the guarantees given by in -process testing. In case of doubt, the tests intended for the seed lot of a live vaccine may also be applied to the final product. If an extraneous agent is found in such a test, the vaccine does not comply with the monograph. Avian live viral vaccin es must comply with the tests for e xtraneous agents in batches of finished product. 6. Mycoplasmas Live viral vaccines comply with the test for mycoplasmas (culture method). 7. Safety a. In general, 2 doses of an inactivated vaccine and/or 10 doses of a live vaccine are injected by a recommended route. It may be necessary to reduce the prescribed number of doses under certain circumstances or amend the method of re - constitution and injection, for example for a combined vaccine, where it is difficult to reconstitute 10 doses of the live component in 2 doses of the inactivated component. The animals are observed for the longest period stated in the document quality control. No abnormal local or systemic reaction occurs. Where several batches are prep ared from the same final bulk, the safety test is carried out on the first batch and then omitted for further batches prepared from the same final bulk. b. During development studies, the type and degree of reactions expected with the vaccine are defined in light of safety testing. This definition is then used as part of the operating procedure for the batch safety t est to evaluate acceptable and unacceptable reactions. c. The immune status of animals to be used for the safety test is specified in the individua l monograph. For most vaccines, one of the 3 following categories is specified: c.1. the animals must be free from antibodies against the virus/bacterium/toxin etc. contained in the vaccine; c.2 the animals are preferably free from antibodies but anim als with a low level of antibody may be used as long as the animals have not been vaccinated and the administration of the vaccine does not cause an anamnestic response; c.3 the animals must not have been vaccinated against the disease that the vaccine is intended to prevent. As a general rule, category 1 is specified for live vaccines. For other vaccines, category 2 is usually specified but where most animals available for use in tests would comply with category 1, this may be specified for inactivate d vaccines also. Category 3 is specified for some inactivated vaccines where determination of antibodies prior to testing is unnecessary or impractic al. For poultry vaccines, as a general rule the use of SPF birds is specified. d. For avian vaccines, the safety test is generally carried out using 10 SPF chickens, except that for vaccines not recommended for use in chickens it is carried out using 10 birds of one of the species for which the vaccine is recommended, the 44 birds being free from antibodies against the disease agent for which the vaccine is intended to provide protection. 8. Potency The vaccine complies with the requiremen ts of the test mentioned under Immunogenicity when administered by a recommended route and method. Expiry date Unless ot herwise stated, the expiry date is calculated from the beginning of the virus titration or bacterial count (for live vaccines) or the beginning of the potency test (for other vaccines). For combined vaccines, the expiry date is that of the component whic h expires first. For vaccines stored by the manufacturer at a temperature lower than that stated on the label, the stability for the entire storage period is demonstrated by an appropriate study. The expiry date is then calculated from the date that the vaccine is stored in the conditions stated on the label. The expiry date applies to vaccines stored in the prescribed conditions. VI. STORAGE Store protected from light at a temperature of 5 \u00b1 3 \u00b0C, unless otherwise indicated. Liquid preparations are not to be allowed to freeze, unless otherwise indicated. VII. LABELLING The label states: - that the preparation is for veterinary use; - the volume of the preparation and the number of doses in the container; - the route of administration; - the type or types of bacteria (and where applicable the antigenic components) or viruses used and for live vaccines the minimum and the maximum number of live bacteria or the minimum and the maximum virus titre; - where applicable, for inactivated vaccines, the minimum potency in International Units; - where applicable, the name and amount of antimicrobial preservative or other substance added to the vaccine; - the name of any substance that may cause an adverse reaction; - for freeze -dried vaccines: - the name or composition and the volume of the reconstituting liquid to be added; - the period within which the vaccine is to be used after reconstitution; - for vaccines with an oily adjuvant, that if the vaccine is accidentally injected into man, urgent medical attention is necessary; - the animal species for which the vaccine is intended; - the indications for the vaccine; - the instructions for use; - any contra -indications to the use of the product including any required warning on the danger s of administration of an overdose; - the doses recommended for different species.
