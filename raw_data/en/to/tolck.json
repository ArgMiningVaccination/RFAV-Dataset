We used a statistical technique (multiple regression) to estimate the relationship between a patient'sreduction in pain and their total hospital cost. We compared this to the patient's cost without accounting for their reduction in pain. The result was an average savings of $160 (per hospitalization) for all patients who received an IM session for relief of pain. 24Cost Analysis: Inpatient IM25 Resilience Training The Resilience Training (RT) program is an 8 - week long group -based skills building program for persons with chronic depression conducted at the George Institute Outpatient Clinic. Key elements of the program include 1:1 assessments from psychiatrist , nutritionist and exercise physiologist.26 63-70% reduction in depression 48% reduction in stress 23% reduction in anxiety Numerous improvements in quality of life, including a 52% reduction in lost productivity. -Cost analysis showed reduction of ~$1,800 in lost time at work ( presenteeism ). Most psychological improvements persisted up to 12 months after completion of the Resilience Training program. 26Resilience Training: Research Results27 Resilience Training: Results 28 Resilience Training: Results29 Pilot Study of Acupuncture in the Emergency Dept 131 treatments given / 146 ptsapproached (90% acceptance rate) 67% Female, 33% Male Average age of patient 51, youngest 19, oldest 91 Average length of treatment 23 minutes Pain is the primary reason for referral 74% of the time, anxiety 11% Improved patient outcomes 34% decrease in pain 48% decrease in anxiety 64% decrease in nausea 14% increase in coping Hundreds of acupressure & acupuncture treatments given to staff members to address pain, stress, anxiety and nausea30 Emergency Dept: Staff Feedback Extracts from Doctor and Nurse notes in EHR -\"Patient's wife also stated that this is the first time she saw her husband normal again.\" -\"Pt receiving acupuncture at this time, ptdeclining tramadol at this time, states headache is improving with acupuncture.\" -\"Acupuncturist has converted the patient from Atrial fibrillation to NSR.\" (normal sinus rhythm) -\"The acupuncture improved her nausea and the Toradol helped with her pain.

Bodywork and traditional Chinese Medicine therapies were most effective for reducing pain, while no significant differences among therapies for reducing anxiety were observed. Conclusions IM services to oncology inpatients resulted in substantial decreases in pain and anxiety.
