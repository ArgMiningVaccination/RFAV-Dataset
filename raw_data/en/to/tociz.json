Migrant students are among the most mobile of allstudents, since they must change schools to accompany their families as they move to pursueseasonal agricultural employment. One of the roles of Title I, Part C, the Migrant EducationProgram (MEP), is to implement strategies to redress students\u0092 educational disruption. Tocontribute to the knowledge base on effective practices for promoting educational quality andcontinuity for migrant students, the U.S. Department of Education\u0092s Planning and EvaluationService supported this study, conducted by researchers at the George Washington University\u0092sCenter for Educational Equity and Excellence, in cooperation with Westat, Inc. The purpose of this study is to illustrate a range of approaches used to promote continuity of instructional service for migrant students and to identify promising practices tailored topromote instructional continuity. The study entailed case studies of district migrant educationprograms, chosen on the basis of nominations from state directors. Four groups of two or threedistricts that share students who move back and forth between them were chosen for study(referred to as Trading Partners). The researchers selected four cases for the study: Case Study One : Weslaco Independent School District, Weslaco, Texas & Pasco School District, Pasco, Washington Case Study Two: Eagle Pass Independent School District, Eagle Pass, Texas & Sidney School District, Sidney, Montana Case Study Three : Donna Independent School District, Donna, Texas; Van Buren Intermediate School District, Lawrence, Michigan; & Manatee County Office of Education, Bradenton, Florida Case Study Four : Yuma School District #1, Yuma, Arizona & Alisal School District, Salinas, California A member of the research team visited each site between June 1998 and December 1998. The researchers conducted interviews with key staff; observed service delivery and coordinationmechanisms; and inspected relevant documents, which included available achievement data.iiThis report is a cross-case report on the findings relative to the six research questions and illustrates several cross -cutting themes. Appendix A contains detailed case studies. KEY FINDINGS \u0095 The case studies revealed that the Trading Partners shared a set of common themes that led to the development of successful solutions for migrant students: shared vision of the role of migrant education, emphasis on program alignment between trading partners, use of technology, value of personal relationships, and importance of leadership. \u0097 Across the case study sites, migrant educators shared a vision about their goals for their shared students and the role of migrant education. This vision embodied the notion that migrant students had unique needs and that the MEP should supplement the basic education program to meet those needs. \u0097 All of the case study sites were committed to aligning local instruction between programs that shared migrant students. In particular, they were committed to aligning with the students\u0092 home-base schools for curricular content and course requirements. \u0097 The use of technology provided solutions to the problems of accessing information and providing instruction to difficult-to-reach students. Technology was used to transfer information on students\u0092 academic records between trading partners, provide individualized instruction, and provide access to another state or district\u0092s assessments and standards. \u0097 Personal meetings and relationships furthered solutions for migrant students in all sites. They helped the districts to understand each other\u0092s needs, policies, and problems in educating migrant students. \u0095 The case studies displayed a consistent set of conditions that led to educational discontinuity for migrant students. \u0097 There was a lack of timely and reliable information about students\u0092 achievement levels, immediate enrollment history, and educational needs. \u0097 Differences in school curriculum requirements and instructional methods between districts and states sharing migrant students (e.g., block vs. traditional schedules, language assistance programs, and graduation requirements) led to instructional discontinuity and credit accrual problems for secondary migrant students. \u0097 Migrant students experienced conflicts between the need to work and to attend school. \u0095 Migrant education programs focused on four areas to promote the continuity of education for migrant students: alignment of district policies, improved studentiiiinformation exchange and access, staff resources to promote credit accrual, and opportunities for supplemental instruction. \u0097 Some examples of alignment policies included the following: LEP students were placed in the same type of English acquisition program as their homebase school; trading partners compared their individual language assessments scores to place migrant students in the same types of coursework; and trading partners agreed on common grade placement policies. \u0097 The districts implemented information systems including the Texas Migrant Interstate Project, the New Generation System, the Red Bag Transfer Packet System, and an email system to improve student information exchange and access. These systems relied on a combination of information technologies and technical assistance and staff support. \u0097 To promote secondary credit accrual, particular staff members were charged with communicating with other districts to determine appropriate courses for credit accrual purposes, calculating and awarding partial credit, and following up on attendance data, grades and credit accrual information sent to other districts. \u0097 Two basic strategies were used in developing supplemental educational opportunities. The first strategy entails flexible courses of study that assist secondary students to accelerate course completion or to finish incomplete courses. The newest versions of these courses use technology (e.g. desktop computer labs, portable laptop computers, and satellite technology) to deliver instruction. The second strategy provided migrant students with additional instructional time, either in the summer, in the evening, or during the school day. There was limited evidence on the effectiveness of the innovations, but most of them are fairly new or are still being developed.1I. BACKGROUND Purpose of the Study The Migrant Education Trading Partners Study was requested by the U.S. Department of Education\u0092s Planning and Evaluation Services and contracted through Westat and the Center forEquity and Excellence in Education at The George Washington University. The study examinedthe coordination mechanisms used between migrant education programs in different states andschool districts to mitigate and overcome the negative effects of educational disruption caused bymigration in pursuit of seasonal work in agriculture. The study\u0092s design encompassed a set ofcase studies of migrant education entities that had promising coordination mechanisms in placeto overcome educational disruption. Such entities were referred to in the study as \u0093tradingpartners.\u0094 The study had two primary objectives: 1. To illustrate a range of approaches used to promote continuity of instructional services for migrant students; and 2. To identify promising practices tailored to promote instructional continuity. The study\u0092s purpose was to share promising practices with the field and to inform it of innovations that would be useful to both policy and practice. Background and Selected Review of the Literature The United States Congress first authorized federal support for migrant students in 1966 through an amendment to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965; thatsupport was most recently reaffirmed through enactment of Title I, Part C, of the ESEA, asamended by the Improving America's School\u0092s Act (IASA) (PL 103-382). The legislationdefines a migrant child as one: ...who is, or whose parent, spouse, or guardian is, a migratory agricultural worker, including a migratory dairy worker, or a migratory fisher, and who, in the2preceding 36 months, in order to obtain, or accompany such parent, spouse, or guardian in order to obtain, temporary or seasonal employment in agricultural orfishing work; has moved from one school district to another; in a State that iscomprised of a single school district, has moved from one administrative area toanother within such district; or resides in a school district of more than 15,000square miles, and migrates a distance of 20 miles or more to a temporaryresidence to engage in a fishing activity (Sec. 1309 (2)). The law establishes that the purpose of assistance given to migrant students pursuant to Title I, part C, is to help them, among other things, to: overcome educational disruption, cultural and language barriers, social isolation, various health-related problems, and other factors that inhibit the ability of suchchildren to do well in school, and to prepare such children to make a successfultransition to postsecondary education or employment and ensure that migratorychildren benefit from State and local systemic reforms (Sec. 1301(4)(5)). The law also states clearly that funds allocated to migrant education are supplemental and should not duplicate services or resources already provided by an educational agency. Thefederal government\u0092s role in migrant education is to administer grants to state educationagencies, which then distribute the funds according to their own policies and procedures and inways that best address the needs and service priorities of migrant children. Migrant students\u0092 profound and varied needs have been documented in both journalistic and scholarly literature. Helge (1991) listed difficulties that beset migrant children and theirfamilies, including dropout rates, low parent literacy, poverty, and low academic achievement.Rumberger and Larson (1998) cited findings that students who have changed schools even oncewithin two years score significantly lower on achievement tests, and mobility by itself appearedto account for half of the differences in achievement. Even when controlling for poverty,Rumberger and Larson found that even one non-promotional school change doubled thelikelihood of not completing high school. Serrano (1983) listed eight specific migrant student problems: \u0093lack of credit reciprocity, lack of fractional credit transfer, lack of course continuity, language barriers, inconsistent gradeplacement, inaccessible vocational and special programs, inaccessibility of mandated3competency tests, and absence of alternative instruction\u0094 (p. 19), with mobility identified as the key disruption factor, even for \u0093return to the same schools in a routine way.\u0094 (p. 9). Migrant education programs carry out their mandate to remedy a wide variety of student needs in many ways, ranging from pre-school to summer programs to night school. They alsoprovide an array of social and health services. However, for these efforts to be effective, theyneed to be coordinated with the other regular and supplemental education and healthservices\u0097both within school districts and across them. For this reason, within the U.S. Department of Education, the migrant education program statute specifically calls for coordination activities. During the 1980s, the Office of MigrantEducation funded numerous coordination projects under Section 143 of the existing ESEA,Migrant Education Interstate and Intrastate Coordination. These projects had varying degrees ofsuccess (Adelman & Cleland, 1987). The best-known federally funded coordination effort was the Migrant Student Record Transfer System (MSRTS). Serrano (1983, p. 11) described MSRTS as the \u0093first massiveinterstate cooperative effort to address mobility and continuity.\u0094 MSRTS was a computerizedmigrant student record system; records clerks at local migrant programs entered student data thatincluded their test scores, immunizations, and placements in grade for transmittal to the centraldata storage site in Little Rock, Arkansas. A migrant student\u0092s new school could request theinformation from MSRTS in order to save time assessing the student for initial instructionalplacement. The Migrant Student Record Transfer System also included a Credit Accrual andExchange Section for high school students to improve credit transfer for graduation. The success of MSRTS in expediting migrant student information has been argued among migrant educators. The Interstate Migrant Education Council (IMEC), (1992), for example, found increases in the identification of migrant students for special education servicesfrom 1980 to 1990 and said that these increases \u0093may be attributable, in part, to migranteducators\u0092 awareness, the inclusion of the special education code as part of the MSRTS training,and heightened understanding among special educators\u0094 (p. 8). However, IMEC also concludedthat \u0093any analysis of MSRTS data is bound to yield tenuous, fairly inconclusive information\u0094 (p.11). Due to the mixed results of MSRTS, the contract was terminated in 1995 and it wasdiscontinued.4The federal government reaffirmed its interest in coordination activities among educational agencies with the enactment of the Improving America\u0092s Schools Act (IASA). Thislaw acknowledges that it is important to coordinate student information and records exchange,but individual states or consortia of states are left to devise their own systems. Currently, few ofthese systems have the capacity to transfer or provide appropriate users the student informationthey need. Migrant education can play a role in articulating common services between educational agencies, but the manner in which that role is played can vary and probably must vary accordingto the situation. Most, if not all, supplemental programs have encountered problems incoordinating their services with those provided by the basic educational program. While the term\u0093coordination\u0094 has been used to describe the role in a broad sense, the word may communicatedifferent things to different people and encompass several different levels of mutual effort. Walp and Walmsley (1989) described congruence between programs \u0093in terms of the coordination between classroom and remedial instruction\u0094 (p. 364) within a school or district.Allington and Johnston (1986) also discussed the importance of coordination between differentprograms that serve the same children in order to achieve curricular congruence; theyemphasized congruence in what is to be taught and the methods of instruction. Stone (1993) defined coordination as \u0093the additional procedures used by people to do an activity with others\u0094 (p. 6). The procedures include \u0093how people find each other, arrange tocarry out an activity together, locate a suitable setting, schedule the activity, and get there ontime\u0094 (p.6). He posits three major categories of coordination procedures. The first, termedrecurrent routines, are customary procedures that carry out well-established routines (e.g., themonthly staff meeting). The second type of coordination procedures are premised on \u0093centrallydirected control of people, activities, and resources\u0094 (e.g., military maneuvers or assembly lineproduction). The third type is \u0093negotiated\u0094 procedures, whether it be an informal arrangement ora well-specified contract (e.g., planning family weekends together or discussing how to improvework conditions). All three sources of coordination procedures need to be in place to coordinate effectively interstate educational services. Recurrent routines are valuable because daily decisions aboutevery act of coordination are disruptive and inefficient. Centrally directed coordination, in turn,makes it possible to set up complicated new routines and to select, refine, optimize, and preserveexisting routines. The main advantage of negotiated coordination \u0093is that it provides alternatives5when routines conflict or are unsatisfactory, or when top-down, centralized control is not appropriate\u0094 (Stone, 1993, p. 11). Kadel (1992) offers a complementary framework by distinguishing cooperation from coordination and collaboration, explaining that cooperation occurs when agencies have an\u0093informal understanding\u0094 that they will help each other without \u0093losing their autonomies\u0094;coordination is seen when a few agencies work on a specific task together but have a limitedrelationship; and collaboration infers that resources and authority are shared to a considerabledegree (pp. 6-7). Melaville and Black (1991) also differentiated between cooperation and collaboration. In a \u0093cooperative arrangement at the service delivery level, partners help each other meet theirrespective organizational goals\u0094 (p. 14). In contrast, \u0093collaborative partnerships establishcommon goals. In order to address problems that lie beyond any single agency's exclusivepurview, but which concern them all, partners agree to pool resources, jointly plan, implement,and evaluate new services and procedures, and delegate individual responsibility for theoutcomes of their joint efforts\u0094 (p. 16). The simple transfer of student information is a cooperative activity rather than a coordinated effort among school districts and the states. However, exchanging student recordsfor credit accrual purposes certainly could be viewed as coordination. More intensive efforts thatrequire resource allocation, such as providing facilities and personnel for another state'scurriculum, might qualify as collaboration. However these terms are defined, reachingconsensus about the precise meanings of cooperation, coordination, and collaboration may not beas critical as clearly defining the roles of the agencies involved, the extent of their involvement,and the extent of their resource and time commitments. Migrant education is cross-jurisdictional by its very definition, between school districts and between states. Local programs operate within the parameters of higher jurisdictions, fromthe district level to the federal government, and need the support of state and federal efforts toexecute successful coordination and collaboration. Conditions must favor coordination and collaboration for agencies to succeed in achieving mutual goals. Melaville and Black described the environment for change: \u0093The mostsupportive climate is one in which the solution to a problem with multiple causes andconsequences...is a top priority of the community, key decision makers, and service providers,6and where previously established working relationships exist among potential partners\u0094 (p. 20). Also required is a \u0093communication and problem-solving process participants use to establishgoals and objectives, agree on roles, make decisions, and resolve conflicts. The processestablishes the working relationships and defines the operational rules necessary to guide thepartnership initiative\u0094 (p. 21). Kadel pointed out that one of the roles to be agreed on has to dowith leadership; the cooperating partners must reach agreement on who will lead. This study describes how migrant education programs in local education agencies have found ways to promote the continuity of their agencies' instruction for migrant students. Itshows how their efforts have dealt with or continue to deal with critical issues: leadership, turf,definition of roles, resources, cooperation, coordination, collaboration, and communication. Italso illustrates how the programs that were the foci of the study functioned in the context of localand state hierarchies. Study Questions and Methodology of the Study The research team identified six research questions to guide the study's primary objectives: 1. What were the conditions that led to discontinuity of education for migrant students? 2. What were the problems, issues, and concerns at the school site level that resulted from discontinuity of education? 3. How and why was a particular approach adopted as a strategy to promote continuity of education? 4. What range of approaches are used in migrant education programs to promote continuity of education for migrant students, and how are those approaches implemented? 5. What impact have these innovations demonstrated, and what problems or obstacles were encountered in implementing these approaches? 6. What cross-cutting themes emerged from the study? In order to identify sites to comprise the case studies, all State Directors of Migrant Education received a letter in January, 1998 asking them to nominate sites within their states forinclusion in the study. They were given the following criteria to guide their nominations:7\u0095 The site should have coordinated with another site for at least three years in order to promote continuity of educational services for the migrant students they share. \u0095 The site should have in place identifiable coordinating mechanisms (e.g., shared curricula, teacher exchange), which promote continuity of services. \u0095 The site should serve significant numbers of migrant students which are shared with the trading partner. \u0095 The site should have demonstrated success in prompting positive outcomes for migrant students. Trading Partners Included in each Case Study Case Study One: Weslaco Independent SchoolDistrict, Weslaco,Texas&Pasco School District, Pasco,Washington Case Study Eagle Pass Independent SchoolDistrict, Eagle Pass,Texas&Sidney School District, Sidney,Montana Case Study School Texas&Van Buren Intermediate SchoolDistrict, Office Four: Yuma School District #1, Yuma,Arizona&Alisal School District, Salinas,California A researcher visited each site between June 1998 and December 1998. Researchers visited sites that receive migrant students primarily in the Summer months, the time of highestmigrant student enrollment. Researchers visited sites that primarily send migrant students duringthe regular school year. These visits were timed so that the researchers could observe the impactof the arrival of large numbers of migrant students and also determine the degree to whicheducational services were disrupted at the sites of origin. The same researcher who visited thereceiving site also visited the corresponding sending site.8During these site visits, the researchers gathered information through a variety of means, including interviews with key personnel and inspection of relevant documents. They alsoobserved services as they were delivered to students. Semi-structured interviews formed theprimary source of information. During the course of the site visits, it became apparent that alarge part of the story of migrant education coordination could be found in the context of systemsset in place by state agencies acting alone or in partnerships, rather than in the reciprocalactivities of local education agencies. Therefore, the research team also investigated thosesystems that seemed to provide programmatic \u0093glue\u0094 to local efforts. Those systems included theTexas Education Agency\u0092s Division of Migrant Education (TEA), the Texas Migrant InterstateProgram (TMIP), the Florida Migrant Interstate Program (FMIP), the Texas Regional EducationService Centers I and XX (for the New Generation System (NGS) and Project SMARTrespectively), Project Estrella, the University of Texas Migrant Program, and the Florida PASSProgram. Researchers interviewed migrant program coordinators, directors of federal programs, counselors, teachers, migrant home visitors, school principals, technical support personnel,personnel associated with interstate coordination projects, growers, and migrant students andtheir parents. The individuals interviewed were too numerous to list in this study; moreover, theywere assured confidentiality to encourage candor. However, the primary contact persons foreach site and project are listed in the appendix. Each case was analyzed from the perspective of the educational problems migrant students faced and the districts\u0092 strategies for resolving those problems. The districts\u0092 solutions,which form the heart of this study, were analyzed according to the levels of coordination theyrequired (as defined by Kadel and Melaville and Black), who distinguished among cooperation,coordination, and collaboration. However, the researchers also found cooperative mechanismsthat receiving districts use which are locally initiated or \u0093unilateral\u0094 adaptations to their ownservices to provide a match to the migrant students\u0092 home district. Since those accommodationsfigured prominently in the cases that formed this study, the \u0093unilateral\u0094 level was added to thecoordination continuum for purposes of analysis. The researchers made every effort todistinguish coordination in its broader sense (referring to the whole continuum) from itsnarrower sense (as defined above).9Organization of the Report Chapter Two of this volume consists of the cross-case analysis and findings relative to the six research questions. It provides a discussion of the cross-cutting themes that relate tocoordination. Chapter Three presents conclusions and implications drawn from the cross-caseanalysis. The detailed case studies are presented separately in Chapter One of Volume II of thisreport. That chapter presents the four cases and describes the promising practices implemented toenhance the continuity of education for migrant children. It provides important contextualinformation on the circumstances of educational disruptions and the details of the coordinationmechanisms that were adopted. Volume II, Chapter Two describes the special coordinationresources the sites drew upon to support their local solution strategies.10II. STUDY FINDINGS: CROSS-CASE ANALYSIS In this chapter, we discuss the findings of the Trading Partners Study as they relate to each of the study\u0092s six research questions. Conditions Leading to Discontinuity of Education for Migrant Children Exhibit 2.1 Conditions That Led to Educational Discontinuity for Migrant Students Condition Cases Reporting Condition Lost instructional time due to early withdrawal, while families relocated, and due to late re-entryWeslaco \u0096 Pasco Eagle Yuma of course credits due to lack of information about courses taken elsewhere or inappropriate placementsWeslaco \u0096 Pasco Eagle Pass \u0096 Sidney Donna \u0096 Van Buren \u0096 Manatee Missed opportunities prepare for take the TAAS Weslaco \u0096 Pasco \u0096 Van Buren \u0096 Manatee Conflicts to work and to Weslaco \u0096 Pasco Donna \u0096 Van Buren graduation requirements between schools andstatesWeslaco \u0096 Pasco11The cases displayed in Exhibit 2.1 show a consistent set of conditions that led to educational discontinuity for migrant students: \u0095 Instructional time was lost due to leaving school before the end of the school year, time in transit, and returning to school after the beginning of the school year; \u0095 There was a lack of timely and reliable information about students\u0092 achievement levels, immediate enrollment history, and educational needs (e.g., level of Englishproficiency); and \u0095 Differences in school curriculum requirements and instructional methods between districts and states sharing migrant students (e.g., block vs. traditional schedules,language assistance programs, and graduation requirements) led to instructionaldiscontinuity and credit accrual problems for secondary migrant students. Educational Consequences of Discontinuity Migrant students faced the same problems at different sites that resulted from discontinuity in their education due to their migrant status: \u0095 Their academic achievement was lower than that of other students. \u0095 They had problems building on either the native language or the language of acquisition due to placement in different kinds of language assistance programs. \u0095 They lost credits because they frequently were not placed in appropriate classes, especially at the high school level. \u0095 They became discouraged because of their lack of high school credit accrual for on- time graduation which, in some cases, led to dropping out. \u0095 They sometimes failed to attend school at all.12Selection of Strategies to Promote Coordination across States Cases examined in the study provide clear examples of efficient and direct responses to problems. Pasco School District opened a night high school because older migrant students needto work in the morning; it placed LEP migrant students in sheltered English classes because theywould not continue studying in Spanish when they returned to the family home; its counselorscommunicated intensively with counterparts in districts such as Weslaco Independent SchoolDistrict because that is the surest way to get information needed for appropriate classplacements. Yuma School District #1 and Alisal School District inaugurated e-mail-basedinformation exchange because timely information was the most critical need; they determinedequivalence of their language proficiency assessments because they needed to understand eachother\u0092s language proficiency scores to make immediate decisions about program placement.Migrant staff from Van Buren Intermediate School District in Michigan visited schools in Texasto find out more about their migrant students and also to ascertain to whom they should speak inorder to get that information. Donna Independent School District, Eagle Pass School District,Weslaco Independent School District, and Alisal School District began extended day, extendedweek and extended year programs to make up the time migrant students were not in school. The strategies that were available to the migrant programs were often those that were created beyond the local program level as universal responses to common problems. Several ofthe programs used the Portable Assisted Study Sequence (PASS), a program that was developedin interstate collaboration as a solution to the problem of credit accrual. Sidney, MontanaSummer Migrant Education Project; and Eagle Pass, Donna, and Weslaco, I.S.D.s in Texasadopted technology-based solutions such as Project SMART, Project Estrella and NovaNET,which resulted from efforts among state directors and regional consortia to collaborate for thegood of their migrant students. Project SMART (Summer Migrants Access Resources throughTechnology) is a national distance learning instructional program that is broadcast via satellitefrom Texas for eight weeks over the summer. Project ESTRELLA supports interstatecoordination through the use of laptop computers. NovaNET is a nationwide computer-basedcurriculum. Several of those districts also utilized the New Generation System (NGS) as asolution to the problem of timely information (with mixed results), but NGS was made availableto the districts because of collaboration among a consortia of state directors following thetermination of MSRTS. NGS is a comprehensive database of education and health informationon more than 200,000 migrant children that can be accessed by subscribers through the Internet.Pasco was able to establish its pre-registration system in Texas because growers had set in placetheir own early hiring system. The Texas Education Agency (TEA) was able to develop Project13SMART because Texas\u0092s Education Service Center (ESC) 20 had already developed the technology through related distance learning applications.

Opportunities for Supplemental Instruction Four basic approaches were identified to enhance the continuity of instruction: 1) alignment of district policies, 2) improved student information exchange and access, 3) staffresources to promote credit accrual, and 4) opportunities for supplemental instruction. The alignment of district policies and improved information exchange systems were strategies that were favored to, among other things, surmount the lack of timely and reliableinformation about migrant students. Strategically placed migrant education program staff waskey in helping migrant students overcome problems due to \u0093differences in school curriculum andin difficulties of accruing course credits.\u0094 Not surprisingly, the problem of \u0093lost instructionaltime\u0094 was addressed by a wide array of opportunities for migrant students to receivesupplemental instruction. Alignment of District Policies. To reduce instructional discontinuity for migrant students who move back and forth between the partners in two cases (Weslaco-Pasco and Yuma-Alisal), decisions to align the educational policies were made. In the Weslaco and Pasco case, forexample, Pasco adjusted its policy concerning language of instruction and grade placement.Coordination of this type, once the decisions are made, is very efficient as it becomes a\u0093recurrent routine\u0094 (Stone, 1993) that staff automatically implement on behalf of migrantstudents.14Exhibit 2.3 Examples of \u0093Alignment of District Policies\u0094 as a Means of Enhancing Continuity of Instruction Solutions Site(s) Reporting Solution Limited English Proficient students placed according to homebase school\u0092s practicesWeslaco \u0096 Pasco \u0096 Pasco Determined equivalencies of local language assessmentinstruments and information to ensure mutual understandingYuma \u0096 Alisal Decision not to adopt a year-round school schedule Yuma Improved Student Information Access & Exchange. This study documented five very different strategies for exchanging student information. The most frequently mentioned strategy was the use of the Texas Migrant Interstate Program. Since its inception in 1981, the Texas MigrantInterstate Program (TMIP) has provided technical assistance to migrant education programsacross the United States. TMIP facilitates interstate coordination of services to maximize the fulluse and delivery of available resources to migrant students. TMIP\u0092s primary goal \u0093is to increasethe graduation rate of migrant students by promoting coordination/cooperation of migranteducation programs that provide services to migrant students.\u0094 The staff of TMIP often serve as the strategy of last resort for migrant educators who are having difficulty getting information about a particular migrant student. In contrast, threeevolving information systems (i.e., NGS, Red Bag, and Teacher-to-Teacher e-mail) weredocumented as a means of gaining easier access to student data or exchanging studentinformation. Finally, the pre-registration process used by Pasco is an uncommon but seeminglyeffective method of generating information that facilitates the timely enrollment and properplacement of migrant students in the district\u0092s schools.15Exhibit 2.4 Examples of \u0093Improved Student Information Access & Exchange\u0094 as a Means of Enhancing Continuity of Instruction Solutions Site(s) Reporting Solution Texas Migrant Interstate Program Weslaco \u0096 Pasco Pass \u0096 Sidney Manatee New Generation System Weslaco Eagle Pass \u0096 Sidney Donna Red Bag (Green Bag) Transfer Packet System where Texas puts all pertinent documentation transcripts, withdrawal slips, test scores and vaccination and medicalinformation into a red bag which the students and families pick up from the school before leaving Texas.Weslaco \u0096 Pasco Eagle Pass \u0096 Sidney E-mail transfer of student information using Student Identification Cards with e-mail addresses of teachers and a electronic student record \u0093template.\u0094Yuma \u0096 Alisal Pre-registration program to facilitate enrollment in receiving schoolsWeslaco \u0096 Pasco Staff Resources to Promote Credit Accrual. In each of the three cases where the partners were concerned with helping secondary migrant students graduate, strategically placed staff (e.g., guidance counselors, migrant resource teachers, or program specialists) were a commonand crucial resource needed to facilitate credit accrual. Given the nature of the problem (e.g.,differences in school curriculum requirements, partial credits from multiple schools/programs,and the high caseloads of most regular guidance personnel), additional staff are needed to attendto and negotiate coordination between the education received by migrant students and therequirements of the school, school district, and state from which the student intends to graduate.Information tools and strategies (such as those discussed above) are important, but without aperson who uses the data appropriately, the primary goal of credit accrual and graduation will notbe achieved.16Exhibit 2.5 Examples of \u0093Staff Resources to Promote Credit Accrual\u0094 as a Means of Enhancing Continuity of Instruction Solutions Site(s) Reporting Solution Staff who are charged with communicating with other districts to determine appropriate courses for credit accrualpurposesWeslaco \u0096 who send and follow-up on attendance data, grades,and credit accrual information sent to other districtsWeslaco Alternative Graduation Plan Pasco Opportunities for Supplemental Instruction. Two basic strategies emerge from the array of supplemental educational opportunities that are supported by Migrant Education Programs tocombat the problem of lost instructional time. In the first strategy, flexible courses of study aredeveloped that assist secondary students as they work to accelerate course completion (beforewithdrawing from school) or to finish incomplete courses (while on the road or upon return tothe home base school). The newest versions of these flexible courses of study often usetechnology (e.g., desktop computer labs, portable laptop computers, and satellite technology) tofacilitate the delivery and individualization of the courses of instruction. Older formats (e.g.,correspondence courses and teacher-made study packets) are perhaps less costly and morewidely available. They also may be considerably less effective. A key for these strategies inmoving from \u0093promising\u0094 to \u0093effective\u0094 is support for an on-going process to improvecontinuously the quality of materials and align them to the appropriate content standards. In general, the second strategy revolves around developing a set of \u0093environments\u0094 in which the instructional services are delivered. Almost all of the school districts supportedsummer programs as a place and time in which instructional services could be provided tomigrant students of all grade levels. Originating Texas school districts, for example,implemented in-school tutorial programs to provide a time and space for secondary-level migrant17students to work on their independent courses of study or prepare for the TAAS. Similarly, the receiving states often supported \u0093evening programs\u0094 for secondary youth to completecoursework. Project Estrella provides a \u0093virtual\u0094 classroom to migrant students\u0097wherever theymay reside\u0097as long as they can access a telephone line. Many of the supplemental educational opportunities were developed by TEA or by TEA in partnership with other states. TEA has accepted its leadership role and assumed a large shareof the responsibility to reduce the harmful effects of educational discontinuity on students whomigrate from Texas. It has supported strategies such as TMIP, University of Texascorrespondence courses, PASS, Project SMART, NGS, the Red Bag, NovaNET, and Out-of-State TAAS testing\u0097all to make it easier for a state receiving migrant students to coordinatewith Texas schools. Adapting local policies, programs, and procedures is a responsibility that isincumbent on the states receiving migrant students, but Texas has made it easier for them if theychoose to coordinate services by adopting and implementing solutions supported by Texas.

The methods through which each of the individual strategies were implemented also can be considered in terms of the levels of coordinationoutlined earlier in this report. Each of the cases presented numerous examples of unilateralaccommodations for migrant students; those accommodations took many forms, some of themrequiring systemic changes at the institutional level. For example, Weslaco, Eagle Pass, andDonna have implemented special guidance counseling and tutorial programs in recognition of thefact that many of their students simply are not present for significant portions of the school year.19Van Buren ISD offers a summer program, which reflects a unilateral decision on its part to provide remedial instruction and enrichment to migrant children during the time they are inresidence. Pecan Grove Elementary School in Yuma, Arizona decided not to adopt a year-roundschool calendar out of consideration for its migrant students. If a migrant student from Texas isnot likely to pass the TAAS, Pasco tries to find ways to graduate them from Washington. Inimplementing each of these solutions, no direct interaction with the trading partner is absolutelynecessary. Cooperation often means the sharing of information in order to make local decisions and/or to help another district with their tasks. Weslaco and Pasco, Donna and Van Buren, EaglePass and Sidney, all have staff that calculate partial credit; they also work to accept each other'scredits and grades on the basis of what they know about each other's course content and gradingsystems. Often this cooperation was facilitated by TMIP and ESC-1, because they haveorganized visitations and face-to-face meetings for staff. Migrant staff from Michigan havevisited schools in Texas and Florida to gather information on migrant students and establishrelationships with other migrant educators. The visits were initiated unilaterally, but they weremade possible through the information resources of TMIP and FMIP, and the cooperation oflocal district staff. Efforts in Pasco and Sidney to support the \u0093red bag\u0094 transfer packet systemalso characterize cooperative behavior. At a minimum, these practices require more than anawareness of the migrant students\u0092 needs: They require cooperation in information-sharing tolearn what kinds of local actions are needed. Activities that fit Kadel\u0092s (1992) definition of \u0093coordination,\u0094 which is one point along the broader continuum of activities generally subsumed under coordination, include the jointefforts of districts (both districts of origin and districts that receive migrant students) working tohelp migrant students start and complete PASS programs, University of Texas correspondencecourses, and TAAS preparation activities. Communications between districts to resolve andaward course credits require interactions and negotiations that create coordination. Districtagreements to adopt a consistent grade placement policy and place LEP students in languageassistance programs according to the home-base school\u0092s practices are also examples ofcoordination. Melaville and Black (1991) would place these practices at a higher level thancooperation because in each case the districts made \u0093substantial changes in the basic servicesthey provide.\u0094 The Yuma-Alisal case provides a clear example of district-level collaboration. Personnel from both districts have met and shared information in an ongoing way; on the basis of that20information, they created a new e-mail system to share information that has implications for both program placement and classroom instructional practices. In each of the other three cases, thereare examples of state-level collaboration that work to assist the delivery of local educationalservices. For example, Project SMART, NGS, the Out-of-State TAAS Administration, andProject Estrella all require the pooling of resources and sharing of authority among multiplepartners to design, test, and implement these activities. Implementation Problems or Obstacles Evaluating the impact of the approaches and innovations remains tentative. The researchers found limited evidence about the effectiveness of the innovations, but most of theseinnovations are still being developed. The research team saw examples of students who weregranted credit based on partial credit calculation or courses completed through distance-learningstrategies. Pasco reported that most of the migrant seniors graduated, but whether this wasattributable to its night school is hard to say. Attribution of effects in education is difficult because of the number of impinging variables. Moreover, even if the innovations described in this study have positive outcomes,when migrant students travel, they are not enrolled exclusively in schools that implement theinnovations. The high school student from Weslaco may enroll in Pasco\u0092s night high school butleave to follow a new crop before the term ends, and enroll in another school district without anyor the same migrant education services. The basic facts of migrant life mean that if coordinationis to succeed, it must involve more than a few exemplary sites. The effects of coordinationshould be evident on a large scale and involve many migrant programs. The problems or obstacles encountered through the implementation of the innovations chosen for this study were as varied as the innovations themselves. In Yuma and Salinas, thebarriers to implementing the e-mail information exchange were two-fold: time for planning andimplementation, and equipment limitations for migrant programs in California. Since NGScannot be directly accessed by all persons who need the information, its effectiveness is limited.Coordination with the purpose of sharing individual student information is especially difficultgiven the lack of a national information system and a national identifier for migrant students. Technology-based approaches, while promising, present a challenge in terms of their cost. Texas has found Project SMART to be a good investment with relatively high start-upcosts that drop off once it enters the maintenance phase. On the other hand, a model such as21Estrella, which issues a laptop to every child, may not be feasible on a larger scale. Limited access to telephone lines affects the effectiveness of the laptop computer approach. Computersand software are costly, especially when factoring in salaries for technical staff to maintain thesystems. This expense may cost more than a local migrant program may be able to spend. If thebasic education program will not dedicate resources for technology, that coordination mechanismmay remain unavailable or limited in application. Coordination also requires continuing commitment. It comes at high personal costs in terms of time and energy, especially in models that rely on individual effort and outreach. Evenwhen coordination is institutionalized, it requires ongoing interagency communication. Forexample, states that tailor their curricula to match that of Texas need to remain informed ofchanges in content standards or other requirements. Initial adoption is not sufficient to maintaineffectiveness; other states need communication with Texas-based specialists. Institutional effortsare easier to marshal and maintain when a sizeable number of migrant students demand attention,and when those students also bring in dollars through the Title I, Part C, Migrant EducationProgram state allocation. Efforts are more difficult to implement and sustain when numbers ofmigrant students are small. Cross-cutting Themes The case studies revealed four different approaches to coordination as it applies to enhancing educational continuity. This study also isolated a set of cross-cutting themes relatedto the solution strategies that addressed the problems facing migrant students. Those themes, asmuch as the coordination strategies, reveal how migrant educators perceive and address theproblems inherent in migrant education. Those themes recurred throughout the cases: \u0095 Shared vision of the role of migrant education; \u0095 An emphasis on program alignment; \u0095 Challenge of secondary credit accrual; \u0095 Appropriate use of technology; \u0095 Maximizing the value of personal relationships; and \u0095 Importance of leadership.22Shared Vision of the Role of Migrant Education Across the case study sites, migrant educators shared a vision, not just about their goals for their shared students, but about the role of migrant education. They viewed the MigrantEducation Program as an educational service that keeps migrant children effectively connected tothe educational reforms being implemented throughout the regular school year. Their visionsupported the federal requirement that migrant education supplement, not supplant, the basiceducation program. They saw migrant students\u0092 needs in terms of what they were missing inbasic education, and they saw the MEP as a resource to get information about those needs to theright people, such as teachers and counselors. They saw their own roles as facilitators toleverage changes that fit the needs of migrant students, such as new policies affecting thelanguage of instruction, provision of supplemental instruction (sometimes through MEP funds),and counseling that supported students\u0092 education in their home-base states or districts. In statesreceiving migrant students, migrant educators often must provide supplemental interventionswhen they are not available locally\u0097but with a focus on those services that best support progressin the homebase school. Although the trading partners selected different innovations, all of theirstrategies reveal their commitment to a shared vision. Emphasis on Program Alignment Alignment was a consistent theme among all the sites, even if not identified by local project staff. Each of the cases provided examples of efforts to align local instruction orinstructional methods between the programs that share migrant students. In particular, they werecommitted to alignments with the students\u0092 home-base schools for curricular content and courserequirements at the high school level. Projects that used Project SMART automatically providedthe Texas curriculum for their Texas-based migrant students. Pasco analyzed courses taken inTexas to ensure local placements were aligned for content and for credit. It adapted PASS whennecessary to ensure its offerings matched the school of origin\u0092s curriculum. At the elementaryschool level, trading partners sought alignment in the language of instruction. Challenge of Secondary Credit Accrual Every district that serves both elementary and secondary students reported that secondary education presents a greater challenge because of the problem of credit accrual. Migrantstudents at elementary grades need instructional continuity, but the instructional demands ofelementary-level migrant students can be met through appropriate basic education services and23such supplemental services as after-school, Saturday, and summer programs. The crisis comes at the high school level, and stems partially from the lack of access to information that will guidetimely placement and awarding of credit. The crisis also stems from lost instructional time;distance learning and individualized programs such as NovaNET and correspondence coursesseem to hold the most promise to overcome this problem. Appropriate Use of Technology The appropriate use of technology also emerged as an important theme. Using technology in certain ways provided solutions to the problems of accessing information andproviding instruction to difficult-to-reach students. Technology also was used in ways that canbe described as both low- and high-tech. At the low-tech end, classroom teachers providedinstruction based on another state's curriculum or gave another state's graduation test; counselorspicked up the telephone and called other counselors to find out what classes a migrant studentwas enrolled in and what his grades were; tutors worked one-on-one with migrant students afterschool to help them make up course credits; and students studied at home through independentstudy courses. Further up the spectrum, migrant data clerks entered current information into theNGS data base. However, sometimes it took a phone call to TMIP or another district to discoverthe facts and/or who to call to access the needed information. At a higher level, migrant studentsin Illinois used laptop computers to study interactively through a mainframe computer at theUniversity of Illinois, and also interacted by modem with their teachers in south Texas. Technology was an effective way to access information in the Yuma-Alisal e-mail project, the New Generation System, and in local student databases observed in Van Buren andWeslaco. It figured prominently as a means for instruction in Montana through Project Estrella,Project SMART, and NovaNET. Telecommunications and computer technology support botheffective access to information and instructional uses in migrant education. Information access came up as a problem in every case, and technology consistently recurred as a solution. Personnel in districts receiving new migrant students had a host ofquestions that sometimes parents could answer and sometimes were contained in hand-carrieddocuments such as the green envelopes and red bags. However, too often the questions, such aswhat grade the child belongs in, had no immediate answers. If the answers to many of thesequestions cannot be obtained quickly and accurately, the child may lose instructional timeundergoing further assessment. At every site visited, migrant educators needed better access toinformation. At every site, respondents said there is a need for a national system of migrant24student identification and access to appropriate information. One person commented, \u0093The biggest problem now is the lack of a national data base. Students with multiple moves do notshow up in the records of a state that is not in a shared system. There is no central reporting ofcredit accrual.\u0094 The same person said that the problem with MSRTS that led to its terminationwas not the system itself but its implementation. People simply did not use it properly, and\u0093ultimately, funding determines what people do. If there is no money for transferringinformation, there is no incentive to do it.\u0094 NGS has emerged as a technological successor toMSRTS but still does not provide complete information access even to those projects whosestates have adopted it. Value of Personal Relationships Another cross-cutting theme centered on the value of personal relationships. This report has provided several examples of the value and power of personal relations as they can resolvemany of the problems of migrant education. At nearly every site, the respondents pointed outthat it is important to give migrant educators the opportunity to meet, learn about one another'ssituations, explore problems, and then set about to find solutions to the problems. Examplesfrom this study include: personal meetings and conversations led to additional staff at Weslacoand Pasco, Donna, and Van Buren; the ability to make appropriate placements, determine grades,and award credit; they led to Yuma and Alisal devising an innovative e-mail system forinformation-sharing purposes; they led to Project SMART, Project Estrella, and NGS.Respondents lamented the reduced opportunity for such collegial meetings due to lack offunding. Before the reauthorization in 1994, migrant directors often had opportunities to meetunder auspices of MSRTS or the three Migrant Education Program Coordination Centers. The Office of Migrant Education has funded a series of interstate projects over the years, as noted earlier in this report, that were geared to increasing coordination of programs, and therewas a strong communication component. There had to be support for travel for communicationto happen. Now migrant educators at many sites say that it is difficult to get people out of theirown districts and states for the purpose of talking to one another face-to-face. Part of thesolution is a commitment of federal dollars, and part is communication to states that coordinationis important.25Importance of Leadership The solutions to migrant students\u0092 problems also involved different levels of personal leadership, from near-heroic efforts at the individual level to profound institutional commitment.Ultimately, nearly all of the innovations began with personal initiative on the part of someonewho cared, who had an idea, shared the idea with others, and gained support to bring the idea tofruition. At the personal level, individuals in Michigan took the time and went to the expense ofvisiting programs in Texas and Florida. A project director in Arizona picked up the phone,called a migrant director in California, and said, \u0093Let's talk,\u0094 then, \u0093Let's meet.\u0094 Individual statedirectors and associated educators met to devise and implement the concepts of SMART,Estrella, and NGS. However, the innovations would be meaningless without institutionalcommitment. NGS is only effective if local districts dedicate personnel, time and facilities to itsuse. NovaNET can be effective in Weslaco because the district recognizes that a largepercentage of its students have to miss part of the school year, and the district acceptsresponsibility for helping them keep up and has dedicated staff, facilities, and time. Many of the individuals interviewed for this study who articulated the importance of personal connections also talked about the importance of state leadership. They said, \u0093You see aperson who is clearly designated as the contact person, who takes care of whole state, consistently participates in interstate coordination activities and communicates regularly.\u0094Solutions to problems were devised when leaders brought \"people along from all levels\" becausethen they are committed to becoming part of the solution. The state director\u0092s role needed to be stable, a fact also cited by several respondents because there are \u0093lots of agendas within a state education agency, and even if a state directorwanted to collaborate he/she might not be able to because of those other agendas and pressures[and] it is difficult to maintain a relationship and establish initiatives that are sustainable whenthe job rotates through people, for short periods of time.\u0094 Currently, most state directors havemultiple responsibilities for multiple programs, and when state migrant directors do not servelong tenures, it becomes increasingly more important to reach institutionalized agreementsamong states so the coordination does not disappear when the director moves on to anotherposition.26The researchers met many individuals who have exercised effective leadership, at state and local levels. Several explicit and implicit stories of leadership emerged, and it became clearthat leaders in migrant education innovations demonstrated a consistent set of qualities: \u0095 A personal vision and commitment to interstate migrant children. \u0095 Understanding of the migrant experience or of discrimination in some form. \u0095 A position that allocates a significant amount of time to MEP tasks. \u0095 Positive personal relationships with other State Directors, especially those with whom students are shared. \u0095 Sufficient tenure to have the freedom to work on interstate issues and have the time to build relationships. \u0095 Support of superiors for the district or state\u0092s role in migrant education and interstate coordination. \u0095 Staff persons or team with a clear assigned responsibility for interstate coordination. \u0095 Encourage and model collaboration by involving other stakeholders in the design and implementation of initiative. \u0095 Willingness to build on work that others have started in the students\u0092 home-base state. \u0095 Support for staff travel to face-to-face meetings with partners at conferences, on committees, or in training sessions. \u0095 Direct experience in implementing and sustaining interstate coordination activities with others. \u0095 Allocation of sufficient funds to address interstate issues. The degree of authority that local migrant leaders may have depends on what the state requires. The Office of Migrant Education funds state migrant programs; it does not directlyfund local programs, which must apply to states for their money. The state migrant educationplan may include a strong interstate or intrastate coordination component, but its success dependson the commitment of local leadership to implement it. Impact (on the extent and quality of services offered to children and families) at both the state and local levels is imperative for successful coordination; however, interagency efforts at27the state level are irrelevant if local implementation is not addressed. Long-term resources and staff allocations must be committed to perpetuate collaboration. If agency staffs do not followthrough at the local level, little progress may occur and long-term collaboration may ultimatelyfail. Interagency coordination at the state level facilitates interagency work at the local level. Several of the case study sites were of particular interest because they had implemented mechanisms developed at the state level. Where state plans do not include strong coordinationcomponents, local leadership can still explore and implement coordination strategies. Some ofthe sites in the study had gone beyond the mandates of their state migrant education plans andtaken advantage of the latitude those plans allowed. In the field, coordination occurs through thecombination of a shared vision, a commitment to align work and clear priorities, efforts thatmake negotiations and program implementation more efficient, personal relationships thatsupport cooperative attitudes, and leadership to get the job started and completed. Nudgingcoordination to a point where all is working effectively is one matter; sustaining it as an on-goingroutine way of doing business presents other difficulties. The migrant educators who haveinitiated coordination mechanisms at local levels retire or are reassigned, and the same is true ofleaders beyond the district level. The mechanisms, though, must be modified continually torespond to new needs, resources, and opportunities. This modification requires ongoingorientation and involvement of staff and procedures to guide their improvement. Otherwise, themechanisms may outlive their purposes or even become part of the problem.28III. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The overarching purpose of this study was to find examples of promising practices in interstate coordination among migrant education \u0093trading partners\u0094 that help overcome thenegative effects of educational disruption caused by the need to migrate for temporary orseasonal work in agriculture. The study identified numerous practices, and four generalstrategies emerged along, with common themes that recurred across the Trading Partner sites.The general approaches documented in this study are: \u0095 Alignment of district policies; \u0095 Improved student information exchange and access; \u0095 Staff resources to promote credit accrual; and \u0095 Opportunities for supplemental instruction. The cross-cutting themes discussed in this study illuminated the conditions, resources, and issues that encourage and make coordination possible. Those themes included: \u0095 Shared vision of the role of migrant education; \u0095 Emphasis on program alignment; \u0095 Challenge of secondary credit accrual; \u0095 Appropriate use of technology; \u0095 Value of personal relationships; and \u0095 Importance of leadership. Many of the specific coordinating mechanisms can be replicated and/or adapted for use by other migrant programs. The procedures, strategies, and practices involve various levels ofcoordination, and nearly all required local accommodations in the basic education program totake into account the other educational systems with which migrant students are shared. The findings of this study, including the crosscutting themes that emerged, lead to several conclusions about the challenges facing migrant students and migrant education programs\u0092responses to those challenges. The conclusions and their implications are:29\u0095 Secondary credit accrual poses the most critical challenge for interstate coordination. The entire school career should progress toward high school graduation, but graduation cannot occur without adequate credit accrual. Strategies to address the problem of credit accrualdemand the greatest efforts in time, money, and allocation of resources. These strategies alsorequire more communication across programs to resolve differences in course offerings andgraduation requirements. While elementary migrant students also face disruptions due to lost instructional time, they encounter less disruption due to dissimilarities in educational programs. However,differences in language assistance programs for LEP migrant students often require coordinationefforts for migrant students in the elementary grades. Other strategies to overcome lostinstructional time, however, can be devised locally, such as extended day programs, Saturdayschool, inter-session study packets, and summer school. \u0095 Strategically placed staff (i.e., guidance counselors, migrant resource teachers, or program specialists) are a crucial resource needed to facilitate credit accrual. Given differences in school curriculum requirements and the high caseloads of most regular guidance personnel, additional staff are needed to attend to and \u0093negotiate\u0094 coordinationbetween the education experiences of migrant students and the requirements of the school,school district, and state from which the student intends to graduate. Information managementsystems are important, but without a person to use the data, the primary goal of credit accrualand graduation will not be achieved. The Office of Migrant Education\u0092s policies should emphasize use of migrant funds for activities that leverage local resources on behalf of secondary migrant students, reinforcing thesupplemental role of migrant education.30\u0095 Flexible courses of study for secondary students are particularly promising innovations. The development of flexible courses of study are a promising means of assisting secondary students either to accelerate course completion (before withdrawing from school) or tofinish incomplete courses (while on the road or upon return to the homebase school). Keyfactors in determining the ultimate effectiveness of these strategies are on-going processes tocontinuously improve the quality of materials, ease of access to the courses, and the usetechnology and training to facilitate their implementation. Currently, incentives for states or districts to conduct rigorous formative and summative evaluations of their instructional innovations appear nonexistent. Most program staff reportbeing consumed by \u0093just getting the job done\u0094 and do not have the time or resources tosystematically collect and analyze data that would inform the development of their practices ormeasure program outcomes. The Office of Migrant Education should consider options toencourage greater evaluation efforts by the states. \u0095 The Internet is an emerging means for student information access and exchange\u0097but data management capabilities remain a significant obstacle. While the promise of student information access and exchange via the Internet was demonstrated by several sites in this study, problems with data entry, access to hardware, andallegiance to local information systems continue to be significant obstacles to developing afunctional interstate system. Moving forward in developing an interstate information access and exchange system will be difficult. Leadership at both the state and federal level will be needed to forge a nationalconsensus on how the disparate systems and interests can be connected or replaced. One meansof moving forward would be to target a priority task or goal for which widespread demand of asolution is high, such as secondary credit accrual, and start there to seek common ground. TheOffice of Migrant Education is the logical entity that could support a process through whichstates can agree on a method to share information electronically that results in measurably higherlevels of credit accrual.31\u0095 Interstate coordination takes time and must be nurtured. Interstate coordination requires patience, hard work, leadership, vision, commitment, and institutional support. It takes time to engage in activities that require building collaborativeattitudes, personal relationships, attention to detail, and substantial effort. It takes strong andconsistent leadership to support, guide, and nurture coordination mechanisms to maturity andadapt them to new challenges. Texas\u0092s long-term support of TMIP and its Annual CreditAccrual Workshop is an example of the kind of nurturing that leadership must provide tointroduce best practices, create an ongoing opportunity to orient and get \u0093buy-in\u0094 from newparticipants, update and re-energize veteran staff, and help individuals form the importantpersonal connections and work groups. The Office of Migrant Education should promote on-going opportunities for migrant educators to meet to discuss solutions to the kinds of problems that this study showed migrantstudents continue to face. The value and benefit of these meetings will be increased if Statedirectors also encourage participants to share \u0093hard\u0094 data that examines the strengths,weaknesses, and effectiveness of the strategies advanced to solve problems related to migranteducation. \u0095 Interstate coordination is not just a process. It requires people who are committed to solving problems collaboratively. Interstate coordination occurs when personnel believe in it and view coordination as essential to their tasks and student goals. Changes to programs and systems do not occur withoutstaff members who hold the attitude and belief that the outcomes will be better for migrantstudents if colleagues, schools, districts, and states work together. In Texas, state staff believe that they need to work with other states if migrant students are to be served effectively by the education system. They have acted on this belief by creatingmechanisms that make it easier for any of the 44 states that shares migrant children with Texas towork with Texas. Similarly, it is the attitude of staff in states that receive migrantstudents\u0097whether in Montana, Washington, or Michigan\u0097of willingness to adapt and aligntheir local programs to the needs of students who migrate from Texas. Such action fulfills thepossibility of interstate coordination.References Adelman, N.E. & Cleland, C.P.

A-72A-1INTRODUCTION The first two case studies described in this appendix focus on migrant students whose home base lies in Texas. This emphasis on Texas, which permeates the study, is deliberate forseveral reasons. First, Texas originates more migrant students than any other state. Although California enrolls the largest number of migrant students, most of those students migrate within the samestate, while migrant students from Texas travel to at least 44 other states. Second, Texas is alsonoteworthy because it has pioneered coordination strategies for the delivery of educationalprograms and services for migrant students across sites. In fact, the researchers discovered thatmany of the existing coordination mechanisms used by the trading partners profiled in this studywere initiated in Texas or involved interstate planning between Texas and other states. Third,migrant students from Texas share a state requirement: They must pass the 10th grade level ofthe Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS). This requirement is not insignificant, norshould the TAAS be considered as solely a state test because it has had an impact on schooldistricts throughout the nation. Many districts outside Texas that receive migrant students fromTexas, including districts included in this study, incorporate preparation for the TAAS to furtherinstructional continuity. The third case study involves migrant children who travel to Michigan with both Texas and Florida as the sending states. The fourth case study focuses on migrant education in twoother states: California and Arizona. These case studies describe each trading partner, list the specific problems migrant students faced at each site, describe how these problems provoked innovations, and detail eachsite\u0092s unique and shared solutions. Each case concludes with a discussion of the coordinationapproaches selected and implemented by the trading partners. Weslaco Independent School District, Weslaco, TexasA-2and Pasco School District, Pasco, Washington The experiences of the Weslaco Independent School District (ISD) and its trading partner, the Pasco School District, illustrate several problems that confront migrantstudents when they change schools as well as strategies that combat those problems. Inparticular, this case study shows how a district that receives migrant students canaccommodate its own services to fit the basic education programs of the migrant students'home-base schools. This case also demonstrates how a district that originates migrantstudents can modify its procedures to fit the needs of a large percentage of students whodepart to follow seasonal agricultural work for a significant part of the school year. TheWeslaco-Pasco case is representative of many districts throughout Texas and the upstreamstates. The PartnersWeslaco Independent School District (ISD), Weslaco, Texas Weslaco Independent School District (ISD) lies in the lower Rio Grande Valley near the Mexican border. It consists of one high school, three middle schools, and seven elementaryschools. In 1997-98, the Weslaco ISD student enrollment numbered 13,271, pre-K through 12.Of those, 5,769 (43 percent) were identified as migrant. Weslaco ISD has the largest number ofmigrant students among districts in Texas, according to the Texas Migrant Interstate Project(TMIP). Approximately 40 percent of Weslaco\u0092s students miss part of their schooling due tomigration. In the 1997-98 school year alone, over 75 percent of migrant students left Weslacoschools for destinations within central stream states. In that year, Michigan received the largestnumber of migrant students from Weslaco (1,342), followed by Minnesota (500), and Ohio(353). Weslaco ISD sent 724 students to eastern stream states and 481 to western stream states,including 147 to the state of Washington. Migrant families usually head north for work in April, a few in March. They begin returning in September, and some do not return until November. They go to destinations all overthe country--Washington, Florida, Missouri, Michigan, California, and other states. Of themigrant students, 2,482 were classified LEP, 278 Talented and Gifted (TAG), 3,469 at risk(economically disadvantaged), and 371 special education. Most of the LEP students are notSpanish-dominant, although their English is sufficiently limited to warrant special services.A-3The majority of migrant students who travel between Weslaco and Pasco consider Weslaco their home. They are accustomed to migration because most migrant families aremultigenerational migrants, although the great majority now only migrate for the summermonths so the children can stay in school. In part, this change is due to the Weslaco ISD\u0092sefforts to educate families and in part to the students' desire to remain in school. Frequently,migrant students who are high school juniors will stay with relatives so that they can finish theschool year and then will join the rest of the family to help with their work. The number ofstudents eligible for migrant education services in Weslaco dropped with the 1994reauthorization of ESEA because of the decreasing from five years to two years on the length oftime one can maintain MEP eligibility with \u0093former\u0094 migrant student status. When in Weslaco, migrant families are employed in agricultural work, working with carrots, cabbage, onions, cucumbers, and squash. This work includes everything from planting,tending, and harvesting to processing and packing. About 80 percent of Weslaco ISD students are classified as low income, and all schools in the district are Title I schoolwide projects. Migrant-funded instructional assistants give firstpriority to migrant students who are most in need. Therefore, the Migrant Education Programstill functions according to the targeted assistance model. Migrant education dollars are notfolded into schoolwide projects but instead are targeted for specific services at the elementaryand secondary levels. Pasco School District, Pasco, Washington Pasco, Washington is located in southeast Washington in the tri-cities area, which is comprised of Pasco, Kennewick, and Richland. Of the three cities, Pasco is the smallest and itspopulation\u0092s socioeconomic status is the lowest. Area migrant workers are employed by fourcorporations in addition to independent farmers; these workers plant, harvest, prune, and processcrops that include asparagus, apples, potatoes, and cherries. Pasco receives migrant studentsfrom school districts throughout Texas, including Weslaco. Pasco's Migrant Education Program has undergone funding shifts, including transferring primary responsibility from supplemental, categorical funds such as Migrant Education or StateTransitional Bilingual Education Program funds to basic district funds. Special funds are used tosupport supplemental positions, but all language development and academic instruction isA-4provided by certified teachers employed through basic district funds. Pasco School District does not adhere to a concept of \"regular\" students for whom the district is responsible versus \"specialneeds\" students for whom a special program is responsible. Problems Facing Migrant Students Migrant students who leave Weslaco often share unhelpful experiences related to their schooling: \u0095 Some do not enroll in other schools because of difficulties in the enrollment process; \u0095 Some attend schools that make inappropriate placements regardless of information provided by Weslaco High School; \u0095 Some attend schools that do not share information with the Weslaco ISD upon the student\u0092s return to the home district. Counselors at Weslaco High School agreed that Migrant Education programs are a key part of the solution to these problems because districts with migrant programs ensure thatmigrant students are enrolled in schools. Schools with migrant education programs also aremuch more likely to make appropriate placements and exchange information. As one counselorobserved, \u0093If there is a migrant program, kids are more likely to go to school. Whether there's amigrant program is the big difference.\u0094 Weslaco and Pasco experienced particular problems that sparked their efforts to coordinate their educational services between sites. These included: \u0095 Lost instructional time due to families\u0092 moves; \u0095 Lost instructional time due to the search for work and housing; \u0095 Reluctance of older youth to enroll in school when time could be spent working in the fields; \u0095 Dissimilar placement practices between school districts; \u0095 Dissimilar high school course coverage between school districts; \u0095 Credits lost because of a lack of student information.A-5Each of these problems is discussed below. The Loss of Instructional Time . Until the early 1980s, migrant students lost instructional time not only during travel from Texas, but also upon arrival in Pasco. First, the family neededto search for work and housing. Then, they tried to access Pasco\u0092s schools and find supportservices such as child care. When these students returned to Weslaco, they also lost instructionaltime because they generally arrived six weeks after the start of the school year. The Need for Migrant Students to Work . Migrant students over the age of 16 often want to or need to work. Work schedules conflicted with school hours; if students tried to attemptwork and school, they were often too tired to study with any degree of efficacy. Of course,failure to attend school leads to academic failure; the fatigue and stress that results fromsimultaneously attempting work and school often leads to poor academic performance. Different Placement Practices and Their Effects on Migrant Students . Different placement practices used by school districts present another difficulty for migrant students. Forexample, the Pasco School District places students at age-appropriate grades and endeavors toprovide instruction that meets the student's needs. Some districts that originate students refuse toaccept Pasco's age-appropriate placement if the student did not complete the grade sequence setby the district of origin. When districts do not accept Pasco's placements in grade, students mayhave to repeat material they have already studied. As a result of this relatively common practice,they become bored or discouraged. They also become overage for grade, which conveys to themthe message that they literally have not made the grade. A consistent body of research on thedropout problem has shown that being overage for grade is the single greatest predictor ofdropping out. Different Course Content and Its Effects on Migrant Students . Other incongruities are also troublesome. Pasco has a comprehensive K-12 bilingual education program, while manyTexas districts provide English-only programs. Weslaco provides bilingual instruction throughfifth grade, then utilizes an ESL approach. As migrant educators in both districts worked withmigrant students, their efforts to address migrant students\u0092 LEP status motivated their work toplace students accurately in appropriate language support programs with a match to the practicesof the trading partner. In general, districts that work with migrant students find that problems are exacerbated at the secondary level. Across the nation, elementary education is perceived as more or lessA-6\u0093generic.\u0094 Young students build basic skills and knowledge; it is easier to coordinate their services. However, at the high school level, different states or districts within the same statehave different graduation requirements. Commonly used placement practices dictate morenarrowly defined courses of study, such as college preparation or vocational education. Highschool schedules can also cause instructional problems. In Texas, for example, as in other statesacross the nation, many high schools use block schedules of four or five 90-minute classes. Other high schools follow a more traditional schedule of six to seven classes per day that areshorter in length. Therefore, the counselor must place the migrant student in classes thatcorrespond to the other school's classes, and fill out the schedule with other classes, perhaps withelectives. These classes may not advance the student toward graduation or provide a meaningfuleducational experience. As students advance in school, it becomes more critical for educators torely upon detailed, accurate information about the student\u0092s course of instruction at the homebase school. Eventually, accruing credits toward graduation poses a critical problem for high school migrant students, due to time lost in moving, different course offerings, different course content,and different graduation requirements. Texas students confront the Texas Assessment ofAcademic Skills (TAAS) and must meet certain criterion scores on its reading, writing, and mathtests in order to graduate. Pasco has to take that into consideration in order to help Texas-basedmigrant student graduate from high school. Migrant educators in both districts reported that figuring out exactly what the migrant student needs (especially secondary-level students) has become more difficult with the demise ofthe Migrant Student Record Transfer System (MSRTS). While transferring student records hasresulted in partnerships as the state level, such records exchange has been difficult to implementeffectively at the district level. Accurate district-level information affects even the mostpromising state-level systems. For example, in states with records-exchange systems in place,local districts must input information to their state\u0092s database. That information then must betransmitted to another state, where it is retrieved by a local district. Time zones create anotherbarrier; two-hour time differences between school districts result in a relatively small window ofcommunication time for telephone calls between educators. Other problems face migrant students as they try to plan for post-secondary education. Too often their mobility affects their performance on standardized tests such as the SAT andACT. Mobility itself creates gaps in students\u0092 knowledge and understanding of complexmaterial. Test preparation suffers.A-7Until recently, educators have held relatively low expectations for migrant students, limiting them to matriculation from high school. But migrant students and the educators whowork with them need to look beyond high school graduation to post-secondary education and/ortraining to ready them for productive futures. When migrant students qualify for collegeentrance, the cost of out-of-state tuition can be an obstacle they cannot overcome. Promising Practices Weslaco and Pasco do not have formal agreements that govern their cooperative and coordinative practices, but as one interviewee said, \u0093Both districts do what they need to do.\u0094Most of the coordination strategies developed between the trading partners can be attributed toeach district\u0092s sense of commitment to its students. Key personnel in both districts share themigrant experience, which has informed their attitude toward the migrant students with whomthey work. Promising Practices in Pasco, Washington Pasco relied upon the combined efforts of day care providers, farmers, agricultural companies, and schools to resolve issues related to excessive time lost in the move betweenstates. Currently, crew leaders recruit migrant workers in Texas for employment in thesoutheastern area of Washington. The agricultural companies then bring in the workers to acentral location (La Grulla, Texas) for an orientation. Families receive information onemployment, social services, and available housing at this orientation. To expedite enrollmentin the Pasco schools, Pasco sends a Home Visitor to La Grulla to conduct pre -registration activities at the orientation. Counselors in Texas schools support this effort by notifying familiesabout the pre-registration event. The Pasco schools rely upon information from the pre-registration process and upon historical data on student enrollment patterns maintained by the district to guide theirpreparations for the arrival of migrant students. Staff planning for migrant students and theireducational needs begins in January of each year. The Special Programs Director, the SecondaryCoordinator, and the Elementary Coordinator project what resources will be needed and wherestudents will be placed. They hire staff for the night school and acquire additional materials. Inthe 1997-98 school year, their projections of migrant student enrollment were accurate withinA-8seven students. Migrant students register for school at a migrant housing site so that migrant families do not have to seek information on how and where to enroll their children in school. The night high school runs from April until late May or early June of each year so that high school students can take core classes after normal school hours. The night high school wasestablished specifically to accommodate the schedules of migrant students who wish to work.The night high school schedule allows migrant students a break after work, time to changeclothes and perhaps take a nap, before going to school. This year, 150 students were enrolled inPasco\u0092s night high school, which also is open to students from other districts if they provide theirown transportation. Until three years ago, the night high school used the Texas state curriculumto promote curriculum continuity. It tried to follow Weslaco\u0092s curriculum because of the largenumber of students that originated from the Weslaco ISD. However, the night high school nowfollows the Pasco curriculum because, although the night high school was designed for migrantstudents, it is not exclusive to them. After the regular school year ends, the district offers K-12 summer school for low achieving students, but not specifically to migrant students. The district charges tuition to allnon-migrant students. Migrant education funds, received by the district, pay for the tuition costsof migrant students who need to attend summer school. The problem of age-grade placement has been resolved through compromise between the two school districts. In recent years, Weslaco has been amenable to accepting Pasco's gradeplacements and does not return students to lower grades upon their return to Texas. In general,Weslaco ISD now accepts the grade placements indicated on records from the schools tradingstudents with it. Continuity in the language of instruction has been resolved. For example, if a migrant student qualifies for bilingual services but attends a home-base school that conducts itsinstruction only in English, that student will be placed in the sheltered English strand of LEPservices. Credit accrual for high school students is facilitated through allotment of partial credits. Pasco\u0092s practice is to calculate the percentage of a semester that a student spent at the school inTexas. Whatever grade the student brings to Pasco is assigned that corresponding percentage ofthe final grade. For example, if a student spent 60 percent of a semester in Texas and arrivedwith a class grade of 84 in algebra, the 84 would count 60 percent of the final grade. The actualA-9final grade is calculated on Pasco's scale, since it is the grade-awarding district at the end of the semester. Partial credit, which takes considerable time to calculate, continues to be a substantiveissue of negotiation. Unfortunately, at some Texas high schools, no one takes the time toconsolidate partial credits, even though Pasco sends transcripts immediately upon request. Information access is the key to the delivery of appropriate services, timely placement, and awarding of credit. Pasco\u0092s Special Programs Department maintains an extensivecomputerized database which encompasses all students in the district, representing the district'scommitment to providing an efficient, timely source of information about students andfacilitating monitoring of their progress. The Department generates a student profile for everyspecial programs student. Every teacher is notified of each of his or her student's membership inspecial programs so the teacher may seek additional information or assistance as needed. Thecomputer system can be used to identify students who consistently migrate from Texas and thosewho move out and re-enroll frequently. However, Pasco migrant educators report that thedemise of MSRTS has taken away the ability to identify frequency of moves that do not involvePasco. Pasco's personnel work hard to communicate with personnel in other districts. The Texas Migrant Student Transfer Packet system provides one avenue of communication. The transferpackets are known as the \u0093red bag and green envelope system.\u0094 Texas puts all pertinentdocumentation transcripts, withdrawal slips, test scores and vaccination and medical information into a red bag which the students and families pick up from the school before leaving Texas. Experienced migrant families know this routine, and most children from Texasarrive with their red bag. Pasco uses a green envelope that was developed quickly after the demise of MSRTS to send similar kinds of information when students leave. However, personal contact still forms a large part of the coordination. Staff report that it is key to findsomeone sensitive in the trading district with whom to communicate. Responsibility forfollow -up phone calls to verify student information is placed on the schools. The Special Programs Department also maintains the district database, which identifies migrant students andtheir districts of origin. The system has the potential to verify current grade placements, creditaccrual, and graduation. Although most students arrive with their red bags, withdrawal slips have to be confirmed and official transcripts obtained. This requires many person-hours by phone and fax. Pasco'scounselors also take advantage of the Texas Migrant Interstate Project (TMIP), which has an 800tollfree number that counselors can call for assistance in contacting schools, or the school districtA-10can call for help in locating another school. The Texas Migrant Interstate Project (TMIP) has information on TAAS scores and contact persons at a student's previous school. About 30percent of the calls made by Pasco staff are to TMIP; most other calls are made directly to theoriginating school. All Pasco school facilitators have the TMIP Directory. Finally, Pasco\u0092s institutionalized support for the Migrant Education Program is illustrated in the relationship between the Special Programs Department and the rest of the district. Whiledirect instructional service is funded through basic district resources, technical leadership andprogram management are administered by the Special Programs Department. For that reason, theSpecial Programs Department has a well-defined role but does not shoulder primaryresponsibility for instruction. This structure allows migrant education services to interacteffectively and efficiently with other special services, such as the state-funded LearningAssistance Program, the federally funded Title I program, the Transitional Bilingual EducationProgram, and special education services. This structure achieves the programmatic congruencedescribed by Walp and Walmsley (1989) and noted in Volume I. The Special ProgramsDepartment also currently conducts the districtwide assessment program, ensuring consistencyand non-duplication in testing practices. Evidence of the local solutions was seen in samples of the student database identifying migrant students, grade and course placements, and type of services received, such as bilingualeducation. The researchers also saw samples of partial credit calculation. Crew leaders and theprocessing plant personnel manager corroborated the recruitment methods and local partnershipswith growers. In June 1998, 16 of 20 migrant seniors were graduated from night high school. Four seniors were graduated from Pasco High School because they did not pass the TAAS, and theother 12 graduated from Texas schools although they had attended some schooling in Pasco,Washington. Four other seniors were credit-deficient and could not graduate. Promising Practices in Weslaco, Texas Weslaco supports migrant students with practices targeted to their departure and their return. Departing high school students can be given course study guides, and when they return,gain credit by passing exams. If a migrant student enters school within six weeks of thesemester\u0092s beginning, s/he is placed in regular classes. After that time, or if the student has verylow language or academic skills, s/he is placed in a self-paced study program. This optionA-11includes modules from the American Preparatory Institute (API). Each module has a pre-test and a post-test. These study modules are problematic, however, because they require readingability many students do not possess. Unit and semester tests for the API modules were devisedlocally to ensure the same levels of competency as corresponding regular classes. Theseself-paced programs last only for a semester. At the semester\u0092s end, the student is placed inregular classrooms. The Weslaco ISD's Migrant Education Program supports extended-day programs, through Saturday tutorials at elementary schools, regular tutorials at grades 1-6, and someself-paced packets at grades 7-12. The Saturday tutorials begin in January when all of themigrants have returned. All migrant students are referred to Saturday tutorial school. The supplemental education services that Weslaco High School provides for its migrant students are the NovaNET Lab, the American Preparatory Institute modules, and night school.These solutions specifically meet the needs of migrant high school students who return toWeslaco too late in the school year to be placed in a regular class. NovaNET . In 1997-98, the district began using NovaNET, a nationwide computer-based curriculum. NovaNET was introduced to Weslaco ISD through the district\u0092s involvement in Project ESTRELLA. Project ESTRELLA is a five-year interstate initiative funded by the U.S.Department of Education, Office of Migrant Education. The Project brings laptop computertechnology and telecommunications directly into the hands of migrant students. NovaNET Learning, Inc., writes curricula which can be modified by districts and uploaded to the mainframe. Once on the mainframe, these modified curricula are available toanyone. Districts pay a fee to the company for access to the curricula, as well as a hook-up fee. While Weslaco\u0092s involvement with NovaNET began with migrant students, it now has expanded to include other special needs students, such as pregnant students or those on medicalrelease from school as long as costs of the program are shared. The district has a total of 50ports among the high school, the junior high schools, and the ninth-grade campus. These portsare used during the regular school day, in extended-day programs, and for adult school (GED). NovaNET offers students the opportunity to make up core subjects through the use of distance learning technology as well as enroll in a range of classes from basic through advancedplacement levels. However, in the opinion of Weslaco High School staff, not all courses areA-12equally strong. NovaNET has been aligned to the Texas Educational Knowledge and Skills (TEKS). Currently, counselors and other staff are trying to align curricula to specific WeslacoHigh School requirements. Students who enter with class records are more likely to be placed ina class than in API or NovaNET. Weslaco High School has a full-time NovaNET teacher, funded by the Migrant Education Program, who supervises the NovaNET lab during the day. This teacher explained toresearchers that migrant students receive priority for time in the computer lab. In addition, thereare two part-time evening NovaNET teachers. The lab has 20 ports for NovaNET access,allowing 20 students at a time to access the NovaNET curricula. One port is used for call-infrom laptops. The district has hired two teachers from each of the four core areas to grade NovaNET assignments, to ensure that NovaNET work is equivalent in content and quality to what is offeredin regular classrooms. Plans are underway to set up NovaNET science labs to simulateexperiments without the usual hazards of chemical spills, burns, and other injuries. API (American Preparatory Institute) . This program focuses on the teaching of critical skills containing special instructional multi-media materials. It is designed to help high schoolstudents in grades 10-12 to continue with their respective graduation program plans andfacilitates the opportunities for migrant students to obtain scholarships. Weslaco staff reported that they now accept grade placements made by the last enrolling district. Weslaco offers bilingual instruction in grades K-5, but not in grades 6-12. Finally,while other Texas districts use block scheduling at the high school level, Weslaco does not.Therefore, the issues raised in Pasco were often generic to Texas but not specific to Weslaco. Weslaco's Migrant Education Program also relies heavily on the Texas Migrant Interstate Project (TMIP) and on Region 1, a regional service center under the auspices of the TexasEducation Agency, to assist it with problems related to information access and coordinationactivities. Those entities have organized or facilitated some of the visits by counselors fromPasco and other districts outside Texas. TMIP provides a point of contact to identify previousdistricts attended by migrant students if those districts were in Texas or other states that supportthe Texas Migrant Student Transfer Packet. The Education Service Center in Region I (ESC-1)serves as a point of contact for the New Generation System, which provides electronic access tostudent records and allows identification of migrant students\u0092 previous schools.A-13Weslaco's 1997-98 Migrant Student Academic Performance evaluation report confirmed that the district has helped its migrant students to succeed academically, but the same evidenceillustrated how migrant students graduation rates are not increasing. The report showed highpassing rates for migrant students on the reading and math portions of the TAAS. The passingrates per grade level are presented in Exhibit 1.1. Exhibit 1.1: TAAS Pass Rates by Grade Level in Weslaco It be pointed out that 10th grade represents the TAAS exit level. Students who took the TAAS in 11th or 12th grade generally had not passed it before. The data shown abovefor 11th and 12th grade are based on relatively few students, mostly low-performing studentswho did not pass the TAAS in 10th grade. The TAAS data suggest that Weslaco\u0092s migrant students generally made good academic progress. However, the data that show overage students at each grade level tell a morecomplicated story. At every grade reported from second to eighth, no migrant students wereoverage for grade. However, at 9th grade, the figure jumped from zero to 49 percent. At highschool, grade level is designated according to the number of credits earned. The TAAS datashown above, coupled with the number of students who were overage for grade, probably reflectthe difficulties migrant students have as they try to accrue credits for graduation. Weslaco's efforts on behalf of its migrant students have demonstrated success. In November 1998, the Texas Education Agency recognized five of Weslaco's seven elementaryschools at the state's migrant conference for migrant students\u0092 exemplary passing rates on theA-14TAAS. In 1998, no one was denied graduation on the basis of not passing the TAAS. This may speak to the positive effects of TAAS preparation offered by districts outside of Texas. Discussion Migrant students moving between Weslaco, Texas and Pasco, Washington faced a number of problems associated with their moves across district and state boundaries: 1. Students lost valuable learning time while families moved, found work, and located housing and child care. 2. Students lost instructional time during the time families work in areas that do not have Migrant Education Programs. 3. Students experienced conflicts between their need to work and to attend school. 4. Students experienced dissimilar grade placement policies. 5. Limited English Proficient migrant students suffered from dissimilar language assistance programs. 6. Migrant students\u0092 academic progress was impeded by different high school course offerings. 7. Migrant students lost course credit toward graduation because they did not attend school or were placed inappropriately in courses in other districts. 8. Migrant students lost course credit due to a lack of information about courses taken elsewhere. 9. Migrant students lost high school credits because they left school. 10. Migrant students missed opportunities to prepare for and take the TAAS. 11. Different districts serving migrant students had different graduation requirements. Pasco and Weslaco have made many local changes in curriculum, instruction, and data processing to accommodate the special needs of their shared migrant student population. Whilemost of the solutions were devised at the local level, the school districts draw assistance frominterstate mechanisms such as the Texas Migrant Interstate Program, which facilitates personalcommunication; Project ESTRELLA, which introduced Weslaco to NovaNET; and the NewA-15Generation System, which provides electronic access to student records and allows identification of migrant students\u0092 previous schools. The two districts worked hard to coordinate the educational services they extended to migrant students. Their coordination efforts and strategies are summarized below: 1. The two districts coordinated their efforts with growers and Texas schools for pre-registration; alternative registration sites were provided in Pasco. 2. Pasco\u0092s grade placements were determined in cooperation with Texas schools. 3. Limited English Proficient (LEP) migrant students were placed in sheltered English or bilingual programs according to Texas schools' practices. 4. Course placements were made based on their similarity to Texas courses or individualized Portable Assisted Study Sequence (PASS) packets. 5. The opportunity to attend night high school was provided to migrant students during the peak agricultural season. 6. Partial credits were calculated and credits awarded so that migrant students could progress in a timely fashion toward high school graduation. 7. PASS packets helped graduate students with Washington state diplomas. 8. In collaboration with the Texas Migrant Interstate Program (TMIP), preparation for the TAAS as well as opportunities to take the TASS were provided to migrant students in Pasco. 9. Student records were exchanged through the \u0093red and green bag\u0094 transfer packet system. 10. Instructional time was flexible and included extended-day programs as well as Saturday programs after migrants have returned to their home-base district, tutorials, and evening classes at the high school. 11. Individualized courses were designed for migrant students to meet local content standards; these were provided through API packets and NovaNET labs and materials. 12. Staff communicated intensively with their peers in other districts so that migrant students could be awarded credits through partial credit calculation or matching course content.A-16These efforts and strategies involved various degrees of coordination at differing levels. Several illustrate local, unilateral accommodations, such as the creation of a night high school.However, it was necessary for staff in both districts to cooperate, coordinate procedures, andcollaborate with other agencies to develop any strategies for migrant students. For example,pre-registration procedures evolved out of coordinative efforts with growers, and are carried outwith the cooperation of school districts such as Weslaco ISD. The bilingual and shelteredEnglish language assistance programs were developed to meet local needs, but placing migrantstudents in the appropriate language assistance program requires cooperation in sharinginformation or the coordination or provision of information such as through the \u0093red bag andgreen envelope\u0094 system. Accurate placement in grade also requires shared information and anagreement to honor another district's placement policies. Partial credit calculation, correct courseplacements, and the provision of individualized programs all require intensive communicationbetween the trading partners and mutual understanding of course content and grading practices.Preparation for the TAAS as well as its administration also requires collaboration with the TMIPin order to keep the service up-to-date and ensure that the local results are duly credited. Much of this understanding has come about through coordination efforts above the district level,notably the credit accrual workshops and educator visits sponsored by TMIP and ESC Region I. The extended-day programs and individualized courses are local accommodations tailored to migrant students' unique needs. These accommodations ensure curricular congruencefor migrant students so local and state standards from the home district are met. Coordinationwith other entities becomes critical at the high school level to allow students to graduate. Themost demanding effort is the cooperation with counselors in other schools to obtain informationabout courses taken in order to award credit and calculate partial credit. Both districts also takeadvantage of the systems that were put in place, notably the Texas Interstate Migrant Program, inorder to locate other schools or to meet with other educators to share information about theirrespective programs in order to facilitate the awarding of credit. As noted in Volume I, Allington and Johnston (1986) discussed the importance of coordination between different programs that serve the same children in order to achievecurricular congruence, especially congruence between what is to be taught and the methods ofinstruction. The practices described above go far toward achieving congruence for the migrantstudents even as they travel between districts across state lines. In addition, the Weslco andPasco case illustrates the cooperative conditions needed to successfully transition migrantstudents between school systems.A-17Effective communication built via personal relationships also seems critical for program effectiveness. For example, even with a record transfer system in place (i.e., in the form of redbags and green envelopes), individuals must spend a great deal of time verifying transcripts andwithdrawal slip information, primarily via telephone and fax. Communication and cooperationhave been facilitated by personal contact. In early 1998, the Washington state migrant directortook a group of superintendents to Texas as part of an initiative on the part of the EducationalService Center 1 in the Rio Grande Valley to familiarize them with Texas-based programs andmake them aware of migrant issues. In 1998, the Pasco superintendent made the same visit.Texas superintendents made a similar trip to Washington a few years ago. During the 1997-98school year, a Pasco High School counselor visited south Texas to establish personal contactwith her counterparts there; she has found the trip made other counselors more willing to shareinformation with her. During the site visit for this study, Weslaco High School counselors produced a letter from Pasco High School to which had been appended complete and current transcripts. Thesetranscripts had already been filed, but a sample of three students' transcripts showed that classes begun in Weslaco had been completed in Pasco. That was possible because the personnel in both districts cooperate with each other. One counselor at Weslaco asked, \u0093If Pasco andWeslaco can work together, why not other districts?\u0094A-18Eagle Pass Independent School District , Eagle Pass, Texas and Sidney, Montana Summer Migrant Education Program The Eagle Pass-Sidney case study illustrates how a sending site and a receiving site were able to take advantage of instructional programs and information systems that were set in placeby state-level initiatives. In this case, the two sites primarily use technology-facilitatedinstructional programs to enhance educational continuity for their shared students. Additionalefforts to coordinate educational services via improved access to student records are facilitatedby the joint use of the Internet-based New Generation System. The PartnersEagle Pass Independent School District, Eagle Pass, Texas Eagle Pass is situated in the upper Rio Grande Valley of Texas, on the United StatesMexico border. For over 20 years, migrant families from Eagle Pass have been traveling annually to eastern Montana to work in the sugar beet fields. These families generally withdrawtheir children from the Eagle Pass Independent School District (ISD) in the Spring before schoolis out for the year and do not return until after school has reopened in the Fall. The sugar beet work in Montana generally lasts for two months (e.g., June and July), after which the migrant families move on in search of other agricultural work. Some mighttravel to Minnesota for cannery work in the food processing industry and then on to Maine forthe blueberry harvest later in the summer, followed by a cross-country trek to Washington to digpotatoes in the fall. After returning to Eagle Pass in November, some families may moveeastward to Florida for a brief period of work in the citrus fields during December and January.The frequent migration pattern seen at Eagle Pass is typical of the migration patterns seen atmany school districts in Texas that lose large numbers of their students during the start and closeof the school year, as well as intermittently during the school year. Migrant families staying in Eagle Pass over the summer or through the winter have limited employment opportunities. Local jobs for those with limited skills such as migratory farm workers appear to be available in the food service industry (e.g., at McDonalds, Burger King, or Pizza Hut). Additionally, local ranchers on both sides of the border hire day laborersfor work connected with the cattle industry (e.g., harvesting hay).A-19The Eagle Pass ISD enrolls about 8,000 students, most of Hispanic origin. Approximately one in five Eagle Pass students is a migrant. The secondary-level studentpopulation is served by two high schools: Eagle Pass High School (for 9th and 10th graders) andthe C.C. Winn Campus (for 11th and 12th graders). Two junior high schools and 11 elementaryschools serve the K-8 population. Specialty programs are housed in the Language DevelopmentCenter, the Early Childhood Center, the Literacy Academy, and the Frank Chisum RegionalTechnical Center. Eagle Pass ISD\u0092s curriculum is aligned with the state curriculum, the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS). Eagle Pass also aligns its instruction with the Texas Assessmentof Academic Skills (TAAS). Both the TEKS and the TAAS have been adopted and approved bythe Texas Board of Education and the Texas Education Agency (TEA) for use by school districtsthroughout Texas. Sidney Summer Migrant Education Project, Sidney, Montana The Sidney Summer Migrant Education Project serves eligible families who live temporarily in the Richland County area of eastern Montana, primarily along a 40-mile stretch ofthe Yellowstone River from Fairview (on the North Dakota border) to Savage. Sidney is themercantile center for Richland County. Agriculture is the dominant economy in easternMontana; Richland County is first in the State for production of sugar beets and oats. HollySugar is one of the main employers in the region. Migrant families come to Richland County inthe summer to work as farm laborers thinning and weeding sugar beets or to work in the sugarrefinery at Holly Sugar. At the time of the site visit in mid-June 1998, the Sidney Migrant Summer Project had qualified 58 families and approximately 120 children; 107 (89 percent) of the children were fromTexas. Of these 107 children, 67 were of school age (grades 1-12) and enrolled in the SidneyMigrant Summer Project. Twenty-five of the 67 school-age Texas children were enrolled in thesecondary program (grades 9-12). The middle school program (grades 6-8) accounted for 25 ofthe Texas-based children; the elementary program (grades 1-5) accounted for the remaining 17students. The 34 preschoolers were enrolled. Six of the eligible children were not enrolled inschool at Sidney. Sixty-five students (age 21 and younger) were actually on-site at the SidneyMigrant Summer Project on June 18, 1998. State records indicated that 44 percent of the Texas-based students were from Eagle Pass. A-20Problems Facing Migrant Students In this case study, the main problem experienced by Texas-based migrant students is credit accrual at the secondary level. Typically, migrant students withdraw from school beforethe end of the academic year in order to travel out-of-state with their families in search ofagricultural employment. Over time, this pattern has a cumulative effect. Migrant students fallbehind in their schoolwork. They experience problems with school attendance, problems withschool grades, problems with course completion, problems with school re-enrollment, and coursefailure problems which in turn affect their ability to accrue credits, be promoted in grade, andgraduate from high school. These problems are compounded at the middle school and highschool levels where course enrollment and grade promotion are contingent on mastery ofparticular course sequences of study. The first problem faced by migrant high school students is the need to complete their coursework and obtain credit for it towards graduation. This problem can be resolved eitherbefore the student withdraws from school or after the student leaves school. The second problemthese students encounter is continuing their education while on the road. In order to continuetheir education, they need to be enrolled in some form of secondary school program that willallow them to earn high school course credits in ways that comply with their needs. Theirchoices include not enrolling in a relevant secondary education program, enrolling in a relevantprogram before leaving their Texas school, or trying to find an appropriate program to enroll inonce relocated to another state. If the migrant student enrolls in a secondary school program to complete his or her coursework either before leaving Texas or upon arrival in another State the next problem h/she faces is appropriate course placement. Furthermore, in order for Texas-based secondarymigrant students to receive course credit for academic work done outside of Texas, the home-base school district in Texas must agree to accept their coursework. Otherwise, courses takenout-of- state will not transfer back to Texas and count toward requirements necessary for a Texashigh school diploma. Lost time in school also means loss of academic preparation needed to take the TAAS with any degree of success. The TAAS must be passed to obtain a Texas high school diploma.Most students take the TAAS as sophomores but have additional opportunities to take the testbefore graduation.A-21Finally, most interstate migrant families generally return to Texas in the Fall after school has re-opened. In many cases, families don\u0092t return until around Thanksgiving or later. This latere-entry into school is problematic, particularly in schools that use block scheduling. In thesesituations, the migrant student may be required to wait until the next marking period, thebeginning of the next curriculum block, or the next semester to re-enroll in school. Additionalschool time is lost, as are opportunities to earn secondary course credits needed for graduation. Promising Practices The Montana Office of Public Instruction (MOPI), the Texas Education Agency (TEA), and the Texas Migrant Interstate Project (TMIP) have a history of formal collaboration that hasresulted in a joint technology-based approach to instructional continuity and records exchange inmigrant education. A 1993 Cooperative Agreement between the Montana Office of PublicInstruction and the Texas Education Agency stated that Montana and Texas would \u0093work in acooperative effort to promote and facilitate instructional practices and policies which meet theneeds of migrant children.\u0094 These agencies listed specific goals: 1. To encourage communication among educators in both states to facilitate the transfer of high school credits for migrant students that would leadultimately to their graduation; 2. To support and facilitate the completion and acceptance for credit of coursework started in one state and completed in the other state; 3. To support and accept the exchange of high school credits and partial credits between school districts in our states; 4. To accept the supplementary coursework provided in each state (including but not limited to the University of Texas Skill Building Courses; and PASS)and facilitate its completion; 5. To provide support for the completion of state or local competency testing requirements for high school students.A-22This agreement has led to an annual spring training conference in Billings, Montana, sponsored by TEA/TMIP/MOPI and geared to Montana and Texas migrant educators. It focuseson the cooperative implementation of distance learning instructional technology (i.e., ProjectSMART) and the parallel use of computer-assisted technologies for instruction (i.e., NovaNETcomputer labs and laptop computers) and records exchange (i.e., the New Generation System[NGS]). Other issues related to interstate coordination in migrant education are also discussedand updated at this annual conference (e.g., migrant student identification, the Red Bags, creditaccrual, TAAS preparation, and out-of-state administration of the TAAS). Representatives fromboth states also attend a credit accrual resolution conference hosted every Fall in the Rio GrandeValley by the Texas Migrant Interstate Program. As a precursor to implementing these technological solution strategies, the MOPI-TEA- TMIP collaboration resulted in an alignment of Montana's migrant education instruction with theTexas state curriculum (TEKS). Montana\u0092s migrant education assessment policy also wasaligned with Texas\u0092s provisions for administering the TAAS out-of-state. Provisions were madefor preparing Texas-based migrant students for the TAAS so that they were prepared for itscontent and also equipped with adequate test-taking skills. This, in turn, led to the use of TEKS-aligned instruction and assessment practices by the Montana Office of Migrant Education for itssummer school projects. The SMART Project curriculum was implemented first in Montana in the summer of 1991, followed by the implementation of the NovaNET curriculum, first through the use ofcomputer labs in the summer of 1993 and then with the introduction of laptop computers in thesummer of 1998. These developments in instructional technology required additionalcollaborative relationships: not only between TEA/TMIP/MOPI but also with curriculum andsoftware developers at NovaNET Inc., Apple Computer Inc., Montana MET-Net, Texas Tenet,the Region XX Education Service Center in San Antonio (ESC-20), and the Southwest RegionalEducational Laboratory. At the local level, the Sidney Migrant Project and the Eagle Pass ISD (as well as La Joya, Weslaco, and Pharr ISDs) have had a long history of collaboration in which Montana hasadopted instructional innovations first tried out in Texas. This initially occurred with thedevelopment of distance learning technology through Project SMART in Texas in the late 1980sand its pilot testing for interstate applications in Montana in 1991. Then came the spread of theNovaNET lab concept at the school district level. The initial diffusion of NovaNET in Texastook place in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The adoption of temporary NovaNET labs forA-23migrant education in Summer projects took place in Montana during 1995 after state education officials observed the labs in operation in Texas districts such as Eagle Pass. The spread of computer-assisted instructional technology in Texas eventually extended to the use of laptop computers with interstate migrant students. Eagle Pass ISD was an earlydeveloper of laptop applications for its migrant population. In 1996, MOPI adopted the laptopconcept by funding a pilot project involving 10 migrant students traveling between Texas andMontana. Subsequently, the laptop project was strengthened by collaboration between theIllinois Migrant Council, MOPI, and TEA, which resulted in the acquisition of federaltechnology funding that currently supports Project ESTRELLA. This collaboration increased thenumber of interstate partnering sites that share Texas-based migrant students who promoteeducational continuity through the use of laptop computer technology. Consequently, the SidneySummer Migrant Education Migrant Project now uses laptop computers as an additional distancelearning option in collaboration with the Eagle Pass ISD. A description of how each partner implements these strategies follows. Promising Practices in Eagle Pass ISD When an Eagle Pass counselor discovers that a migrant student will leave school in the Spring before the end of the school year, or has returned to Eagle Pass in the Fall after school hasopened and wants to re-enroll, he/she will try to get the student involved in one or more of thefollowing interventions: \u0095 Computer-assisted instruction through a NovaNET lab or assignment of a laptop computer; \u0095 Enrollment in a TAAS-Prep course available through one of several options; \u0095 Participation in the credit-by-exam option offered through the University of Texas Migrant Program; \u0095 Enrollment in Project SMART. Each of these major interventions is described below, including their alternative delivery systems.A-24NovaNET . A description of NovaNET was provided in the first case study. Eagle Pass has been implementing NovaNET since the 1993-94 school year. NovaNET labs in the EaglePass ISD are housed at both of the high schools and are used as an alternative instructionalmethodology for secondary students who have failed in the regular classroom. Two teachers(English and math) and a lab manager supervise each NovaNET lab. A school counselor makesrecommendations for NovaNET enrollment for the migrant students in either the Spring or Fallof the school year. In the Spring, these assignments include Summer assignments for migrantstudents given laptop computers who then have the capability of accessing the NovaNET lab inEagle Pass from remote out-of-state locations using their computer\u0092s modem connected to atelephone. NovaNET software modules cover the full spectrum of the Texas secondary school curriculum, from math and English to science and social studies, including TAAS-Prep, PSAT-Prep and SAT-Prep, GED-Prep, and ESL. English courses tend to be the main focus for themigrant students and NovaNET is considered strong in terms of its English grammar lessons.NovaNET is a good alternative for students who need individualized attention\u0097from theindividualized approach provided by computer-assisted instruction and from individual and smallgroup work with the NovaNET teacher. It allows students to work at their own pace and followtheir own time schedule. However, it does not provide much opportunity for extended reading orwriting composition. For these latter areas, school personnel tend to augment NovaNET withcurriculum material from other sources. Most students using NovaNET are trying to make up assignments to get credit in their classes. Course credits are based on the number of lessons that are completed satisfactorily in theassigned NovaNET modules. The NovaNET teacher verifies the work, assigns a grade, andposts the grade or grade change with the registrar\u0092s office in the ISD. The NovaNET labs in Eagle Pass address a number of different kinds of student situations bearing on credit accrual needs. These are reviewed below and can generally beconsidered variations of an \u0093extended day\u0094 approach. Eighth-Period Instruction with High School Seniors . The upper-division high school (C.C. Winn Campus) uses NovaNET with high school seniors who have failed a requiredEnglish or math course and who are taking more than one English or math course. NovaNETprovides these seniors an opportunity to complete the course they need for graduation when theydo not have the opportunity to take the needed course a second time because they cannot fit theA-25course into their schedule or because the needed course is not being offered before the end of the school year. NovaNET is offered for these students during the eighth class period of the schoolday. This allows these seniors to pick up the English or math credit they need during the schoolyear and graduate on time with their class. Thus, they avoid the need to enroll in summer schoolor re-enroll in high school after their senior year to complete a single course needed forgraduation. The 8th period option is also used as an alternative for migrant students who cannot attend the Saturday and After-School \u0093add-on\u0094 Programs in the Fall because of weekend or afterschool employment. They also are an alternative for migrant students returning to Eagle Passlate in the Fall who have been denied course or school enrollment because of block schedulingconflicts. The NovaNET labs provide these migrant students with opportunities to resume theireducation when they cannot enroll in a class they need to complete for graduation. Accelerated Instruction for High School Sophomores and Juniors . NovaNET provides sophomores and juniors an opportunity for accelerated instruction. Participants in this programinclude those migrant students who want to complete their coursework in the Spring beforewithdrawing from school to travel with their family for employment out-of-state. It also providesa solution for those migrant students who do not want to make up the course in summer school.Such students must demonstrate a degree of self-motivation and independence to be successfulwith NovaNET. Graduation Enhancement . Migrant students who enroll a few weeks late in the Fall or who are getting failing grades in the first 6-week marking period are referred by schoolcounselors to this after-school NovaNET lab. This extended-day class is provided as anopportunity for these migrants to make up the work they missed the first six weeks of school orto remediate failing performance. Graduation Enhancement (GE) classes meet Monday through Thursday for one hour after school. The classroom teacher sends lesson material to the \u0093add-on\u0094 class that s/he expects to becovered; this material either was missed the first six weeks or is content on which the student\u0092sperformance is poor. The GE teacher then provides instruction in those materials. The GEclasses tend to be project- or task-oriented. Students must demonstrate mastery of specificassignments and skills (e.g., completing a research paper, completing a curriculum unit,completing a book report, or completing some test like the TAAS).A-26Migrant students who know they will miss the last six weeks of school can participate in an after-school program to complete the work they would otherwise miss. This is a Winterversion of the Graduation Enhancement Program. Summer School Now . Migrant students who missed the majority of the first six weeks of school must attend the Summer School Now Program which meets for five Saturdays in a rowfrom 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. They must attend all five make-up sessions in order to receive credit forthe class they missed. Remote Access to NovaNET . Eagle Pass has been operating its own laptop computer project for approximately three to four years under the supervision of the high school counselorsand NovaNET lab teachers. The laptop project essentially extends student access to NovaNETthrough the use of telecommunications technology (i.e., use of a portable computer with amodem and access to a telephone). Interstate migrant students can access NovaNET with a laptop computer when they are traveling out-of-state with their families in the summer. As many as 50 migrant studentsparticipate each summer in this locally funded project (through Title 1 Migrant EducationProgram funds). Migrant students are assigned laptops based on a number of factors, includinginstructional need, student maturity and dependability, and the anticipated distance of thefamily\u0092s summer location relative to the family\u0092s access to summer school project sites in anupstream state. Migrant students whose families are too remote from a summer school site willbe given preference for a laptop. The alternative for many migrant students is to travel by busfrom a migrant camp to a night school to participate in a summer instructional program of somesort (e.g., a SMART broadcast). Under such circumstances, the migrant students can show uplate for class and be too tired to concentrate on their studies. Remoteness of location is a primaryconsideration for assigning a laptop to a student plus demonstrated motivation for making upcredits or enrichment interests. An Eagle Pass counselor determines summer course assignments for laptop applications. For example, the counselor might determine that the student needs to complete English IA overthe summer. A form identifying the assignment then is given to the student by the counselor totake to the NovaNET teacher who then might assign 25 percent of the coursework as a writingassignment and 75 percent to be completed on specific NovaNET English modules. Next, alaptop computer is issued to the student by one of the NovaNET labs in Eagle Pass so the studentcan work on those lessons through the NovaNET instructional modules. A NovaNET accessA-27program is loaded onto the student\u0092s laptop computer by the Eagle Pass NovaNET lab so the migrant student can log onto NovaNET from a remote site using a toll-free 800 phone numberand the modem installed on the computer. The NovaNET lab manager makes sure the student knows how to use the laptop properly and is able to trouble-shoot if something should go wrong with it. Each student issued a laptop isrequired to sign a contract that stipulates how the laptop will be used. This contract also ensuresthat the student will return the laptop in the Fall; the ISD has yet to lose a laptop. The contract isalso an agreement with the teacher about the student\u0092s work over the Summer. Migrant students are issued two toll-free numbers to access technical assistance support for their laptop: the NovaNET lab in Eagle Pass and the Texas Migrant Interstate Program(TMIP) in Pharr for back-up assistance. Technical support calls can include phone assistance,arranging a home visit from a technician, or mailing the student a program diagnostic card toinsert into the computer. The toll-free number to the Eagle Pass NovaNET lab also enables thestudent to log into the NovaNET database to begin working on his or her assignments. If thestudent dials in at a prescribed time, s/he can interact instructionally with their NovaNET teacherusing email. E-mail is also used for follow-up interactions between the student and teacherregarding the student\u0092s performance on the assignment. The problem most often encountered by the laptop users is finding a phone line they can use to call into the NovaNET lab in Eagle Pass. The ISD tried to circumvent this problem byasking Southwest Bell to donate cell phones to the district for the students to use with theirlaptops. This proposal did not work because \u0093rolling charges\u0094 would be incurred fromconnecting calls across multiple commercial telephone carriers that operate the telephonesystems between the upstream sites and Eagle Pass. Currently, the ISD loads the NovaNETcourse modules on disk. Students then use their laptops to work on their assignments withoutneeding access to a telephone. The student mails the diskette back to Eagle Pass when s/hewants final feedback from the teacher. Project ESTRELLA . A federal technology grant to the Illinois Migrant Council, in collaboration with TEA and MOPI, provides Eagle Pass with an additional 10 laptop computers.ESTRELLA also provides \u0093Cyber Counselors\u0094 in addition to funding laptop computers forremote access to NovaNET. The cyber counselors are college students who function as rolemodels. These students e-mail the migrant students issued laptop computers as a type of cyberA-28\u0093pen pal.\u0094 The cyber counselors monitor the migrant student\u0092s schoolwork, give encouragement, and provide tutorial guidance. TAAS-Prep . The Eagle Pass curriculum is aligned with the Texas state curriculum (the TEKS) and the statewide assessment (the TAAS). The remediation of academic skills in EaglePass thus tends to be synonymous with preparing students to take and pass the TAAS. The latteris generally referred to as \u0093TAAS-Prep.\u0094 There are a variety of ways TAAS prep is provided in Eagle Pass. At its most basic, TAAS pretests identify student strengths and weaknesses; these pretests are followed byremedial teaching focused on skill improvement. Students also learn test-taking skills by takingTAAS practice tests through NovaNET. Migrant students also can take a TAAS-tutorial and aTAAS-After-School course. Finally, there is the Power-TAAS course, which is an intensivethree-day TAAS-Prep class, offered to juniors and seniors to help them prepare for taking theTAAS. Student transcripts identify the kinds of TAAS-Prep taken (e.g., TAAS Prep Math orReading; TAAS tutorial; TAAS-After-School). of Texas Migrant Program: Credit by Exam Model . The Texas Education Agency and the Texas Board of Education have approved all University of Texas MigrantProgram courses for secondary school credit. These courses include the high school Englishcourses that the University of Texas (UT) has developed. In Eagle Pass, the UT program usedmost is the Credit-by-Exam option. This is an independent home-study approach in whichmigrant students use a textbook and study guide developed by UT that is monitored weekly by ahome visitor. The students work at their own pace and take a proficiency exam once they havecompleted the course material and their work has been reviewed satisfactorily by the localinstructor. When the student is ready to take the exam, Eagle Pass ISD orders the appropriatetest from UT. The exam is administered by the Eagle Pass ISD and graded at UT\u0097Austin. Thestudent must pass the test to demonstrate that s/he has mastered the subject matter and receiveshigh school credit for the course. The credit-by-exam approach is used mostly with in-school migrant students who stay in Eagle Pass over the summer. Although the UT English courses are more difficult than otheralternatives for obtaining secondary English credits, they are the fastest way for migrant studentsto obtain such course credits.A-29Credit-by-exam can also be used by migrant students re-entering the ISD who want to acquire credit for subjects in which the student previously received instruction but either hasfailed or not completed. Additionally, credit-by-exam can be used to accelerate students whowant credit for a course without waiting to take the course when offered as part of the ISD\u0092sregular schedule. This is an anticipatory option that migrant students can choose in completingcourses before withdrawing from the ISD. Project SMART: Home-Based Model . Project SMART (Summer Migrants Access Resources through Technology) is a national distance learning instructional program that isbroadcast from the Region XX Education Services Center (ESC-20) in San Antonio, Texas, viasatellite for eight weeks over the summer (June and July). It is designed for Texas migrantstudents, both those who remain in Texas in the Summer as well as those are who aretemporarily residing in other participating states around the country. For those moving out ofstate for the Summer, enrollment in Project SMART is the responsibility of the receiving site(e.g., the Sidney Summer Migrant Education Project). For those staying in Eagle Pass over thesummer, a home instruction version of SMART is available. The home-based model is used in Eagle Pass in the Summer for all migrant students that stay behind and do not travel out of state. The Summer instructional broadcasts for each agegroup are taped by the ISD and then taken to the home on videocassette by a home visitor wherethey are shown. The home visitors will leave a tape on one visit and pick it up on the next,leaving a new tape at that time. Tapes from the previous year along with the TAAS-Prep tapescan also be taken into the home and shown if appropriate. In this way, SMART provides EaglePass with a summer school curriculum for the in-state migrant population. Information Access . In addition to these instructional programs, school counselors need access to student records to ensure that migrant students\u0092 schoolwork\u0097whether from Texas oroutside of Texas\u0097can be counted toward Texas state graduation requirements. The registrar\u0092soffice in Eagle Pass documents student course credits in an official school transcript. Otherimportant information about the student\u0092s school history (e.g., school attendance record, date ofwithdrawal from Eagle Pass ISD, final course grades, course completion status and the grade atthe time of course withdrawal) is also recorded on the transcript. When students withdraw fromschool, this information is put on a withdrawal form. Migrant families sometimes use the \u0093red bag\u0094 to carry school documents such as transcripts and withdrawal forms with them when they travel out of state. These documents areA-30also available to receiver school systems on request. A number of methods are available for obtaining these documents: by telephone, mail, and fax; and through the Internet using the NewGeneration System (NGS). In Eagle Pass, four NGS records clerks enter, maintain, and updatethe NGS student data. The data are used mostly by counselors and teachers to record or checkon secondary credit accrual data. Since the system does not provide standard reports withaggregated data, administrators do not often use it. The Sidney Project claimed that many of the NGS records from Eagle Pass were missing secondary credit accrual data. This is quite plausible since the NGS data were processed byESC-20 during most of June. It takes about a month from the end of the school year (end ofMay) for course grades to be processed through the ESC-20 in San Antonio and becomeavailable on NGS to upstream states. The earliest that Montana could have gotten completeNGS data for course planning purposes would have been the end of June, too late to guide courseplanning. The only other way for upstream states to obtain course completion and course gradeinformation is not reliable: if the family brings a withdrawal form with them when they enrollfor the Summer, which means the Summer project would have to contact Eagle Pass. Promising Practices in the Sidney Summer Migrant Education Project, Sidney, Montana In its coordinative efforts with Texas, Montana essentially adopted a parallel system of the technology-based instructional programs and then implemented them locally in its Summerproject sites. Therefore, the instructional approach used in Sidney mirrors the instructionalapproach of Eagle Pass. In Sidney, migrant education uses a technology-based to promote interstate coordination and continuity of instruction. Both the SMART and NovaNET curricula used in Sidney arebased on the Texas state curriculum and offer credit-bearing courses approved by the TexasEducation Agency and accepted by Texas schools. Telecommunications technology is used inthe SMART project component to promote continuity of instruction with the Texas curriculumthrough lessons broadcast by satellite from the Region XX Education Services Center (ECS-20)in San Antonio. Sidney\u0092s use of laptop computers and a temporary Summer computer lab allowsTexas-based migrant students in Sidney to access the NovaNET curriculum back in Texas. Project SMART: Site-Based Model . The Sidney Summer Migrant Project implemented Project SMART\u0092s site-based model in which students could participate interactively in aclassroom setting with the SMART television teacher or view the instruction later on videotape.A-31The instructional focus of the SMART broadcasts varied according to the students' grade level: integrated math, science, and language for the elementary school students; science for the middleschool students; and economics for the high school students. Five instructional strands wereoffered to students at Sidney: \u0095 Preschool: Language Development in Spanish & English \u0095 Early Elementary: Integrated Math, Science, & Language \u0095 Upper Elementary: Integrated Math, Science, & Language \u0095 Middle School: Science \u0095 High School: Economics, TAAS Math Preparation Each interactive SMART class utilized a local teacher\u0097the \u0093SMART Partner\u0094\u0097to prepare the students for the instructional broadcast, to facilitate interactions by telephone withthe SMART television teacher back at ESC-20, and to conduct follow-up instruction and assessment. Only the high school courses are offered for credit. Each Summer, one subject is taught; in Summer 1998 this subject was Economics. NovaNET . The NovaNET lab at Sidney provides computer-assisted instruction in a broad range of credit-bearing courses at the middle school and high school levels. As at Eagle Pass,the NovaNET lab consists of about 16 desktop personal computers, running off a server, thataccess the TEKS-based NovaNET curriculum in Eagle Pass through fiber-optic telephone linesvia each computer\u0092s modem. The courses offered in Sidney are the same ones offered in EaglePass and in other Texas school districts that implement NovaNET labs. Each NovaNET course consists of a series of interactive modules. Students move at their own pace and are provided feedback by the computer on each lesson attempted. The computeralso records the lessons attempted, time spent on the lessons, dates, and assessment outcomes forthe lessons. A lesson must be passed in order to move to the next lesson in a module's sequenceof instruction. The two high school instructors supervise the NovaNET lab each night,monitoring the students to keep them on task if necessary and to provide assistance to studentswho need it. High school students attend the NovaNET lab in the evening after their work in theA-32fields. Testing preparation and administration for the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) is also provided through the computerized NovaNET curriculum. Laptop Computers: Project ESTRELLA . Laptop computers in Sidney are provided by the federal technology grant administered by the Illinois Migrant Council. If students can accessa telephone line, they can use the laptops just about anywhere. This enables them to connectwith the Internet, communicate with their teachers in Texas over the Summer, and communicatewith their college cyber counselors in San Antonio. University of Texas Correspondence Courses . As stated earlier, NovaNET is good for basic skill applications but less well adapted to the development of advanced skills. Whenstudents need credit-bearing courses like English literature, the Sidney project arranges anindependent study correspondence course through the University of Texas Migrant Program(UT). The University of Texas Migrant Program provides the course material and books; theSidney teachers supervise and grade the student's UT work while they remain in Montana.When the student leaves Montana, s/he mails the work to UT and the UT staff grades thestudent\u0092s work and provides feedback. Sidney uses the UT Correspondence Course rather thanPASS (the Portable Assisted Study Sequence) because Texas schools readily accept the UTcourses for credit. Texas schools will accept PASS courses, but additional staff work is requiredto ensure the PASS courses are appropriate for the student. Information Access . As at other sites profiled in these case studies, a number of approaches were used to communicate information so that instructional planning for migrantstudents can be eased. Student information can be accessed through the New Generation System(NGS), a comprehensive database of education and health information on more than 200,000migrant children that can be accessed by subscribers through the Internet. Information is alsocarried by migrant families in the student record transfer packets (commonly referred to as the\u0093red bags\u0094) issued by Texas migrant programs. Four of the 24 secondary-level Texas-basedstudents (or 17 percent) provided school records and report cards from Texas when they arrivedin Sidney during the school year that this study was conducted. When information is not obtainable through NGS or a record transfer packet, school staff may resort to telephone and fax. A Sidney staff member, (e.g., one of the secondary teachers orthe program director), will call the child's homebase school in Texas to ask that they update thestudent's NGS record or fax the desired information to Sidney if that would be faster (about halfof the secondary students needed their NGS information updated when they arrived in Sidney).A-33The Sidney secondary school staff also calls Texas home-base school principals and guidance counselors to review student needs and summer school course options so that the courses thestudents take in Montana are approved for credit by their Texas school. Promising Practices: A Migrant Parent\u0092s Perspective Ernesto Sr. and his family often travel to find seasonal employment in agriculture. Through his participation in parent involvement events and opportunities, he is also very familiarwith the Migrant Education Program. In interviews with researchers that were conducted in bothSidney and Eagle Pass, Ernesto Sr. provided insight into both the challenges facing migrantfamilies and the way the migrant program serves his school-age children. The material thatfollows is a synthesis of these interviews. Ernesto Sr. arrived in Montana from Eagle Pass the first week in June 1998 to work the sugar beet fields. He remained in Montana for approximately six weeks and then returned toTexas for a month to pick grapes in the vineyards around Austin. He then packed up his familyagain and traveled to Minnesota to work for several weeks in the vegetable canneries after whichthe family traveled to Maine for the blueberry harvest in August. In the Fall, Ernesto Sr. traveledwith his eldest son Ernesto Jr. all the way across the country to Washington to dig potatoes,which they did until November. Ernesto Sr. and his son returned to Eagle Pass a week beforeThanksgiving. Ernesto Sr. will resume his migrant cycle in June 1999. Ernesto Sr. has eight children, seven of whom he brought with him to Montana in June 1998. The Eagle Pass ISD issued a laptop computer to his family for use by several of his highschool children over the summer. His son (Ernesto Jr.) had failed algebra and English IV as asenior in the 1997-98 school year and was issued a laptop specifically so he could work onmaking up the 1.5 course credits he needed in these subject matter areas. Two of Ernesto Sr.'sdaughters were also allowed to use the laptop computer, but for acceleration and enrichmentpurposes. Maria (a sophomore next year) was provided coursework in world history and Anawas assigned work in English IV. Ana would have been a senior in the academic year thatfollowed this study; she is trying to earn senior-level English credit with the aid of the laptopcomputer. In addition, the Sidney Project issued Ernesto Sr.\u0092s family a second laptop computerthat his younger children could use at home over the summer (e.g., the children aged 5 and 9). Ernesto Sr. has had experience with the \"red bags\" which he said were initiated in 1993 following the federal decision to terminate the MSRTS. Initially, the bags were a temporaryA-34measure instituted by Texas to transfer student records with upstream states receiving its migrant students. Ernesto Sr. characterized the red bags as a way to help migrant families takeresponsibility for records transfer with schools. Migrant parents are encouraged to use the bagsto carry their children's school records to their next destination during interstate migrationswhere they are supposed to turn the records over to the receiving schools. Ernesto Sr. knows that the NGS has since superseded the red bags. Although Ernesto thought that MSRTS was effective in spite of its flaws, he thought the NGS might be animprovement over the MSRTS because of the speed with which relevant information can beobtained. When asked to discuss the kinds of educational problems that migratory farm worker families encounter, Ernesto Sr. mentioned that many families do not re-enroll their children inschool once they arrive in a new state. He also mentioned that their children do not retainknowledge and skills when they are out of school for a while; they lose their motivation tore-enroll, particularly if credit accrual problems are on the increase. These credit accrual problems, Ernesto Sr. observed, often lead migrant students to drop out of school. He thoughtthe laptops could help his children catch up on coursework they had missed while migrating andto stay current in their credits. Asked how the laptops had helped his children, Ernesto Sr. used his son as an example. Ernesto Jr. had been denied high school graduation because of credit deficiencies (1.5 credits): ahalf credit in algebra and a full credit in English IV. Eagle Pass ISD issued him a laptop for thesummer of 1998 and assigned him lessons in both of these deficiency areas, including relevantNovaNET lesson modules. He did the lessons (at least some of them) on the laptop anddownloaded his work to his summer school teacher in Eagle Pass who graded the work fromTexas. Ernesto Sr. was hopeful that Ernesto Jr. would graduate from high school at the end ofSummer 1998. The migrant education staff doubted he would complete the 1.5 credits byAugust, and it turned out they were right. A follow-up interview was conducted with Ernesto Sr. in Eagle Pass, Texas, in November 1998, after he and his son had returned from their summer migrations. Ernesto Jr.ended up returning to Eagle Pass ISD in 1999 and hopefully will graduate at the end of the 1998-99 school year. In November 1998 he was still working on his English and math assignments onthe laptop and had not yet graduated. He needed a full year of senior English and a semester ofAlgebra II; over the Summer and Fall he had made little progress in completing his studies.A-35Ernesto Sr. said that the biggest problem about laptop use had been access to a telephone while on the road between Montana, Texas, Maine, and Washington State. Ernesto Jr. also had littletime or energy left to use the laptop computer after spending 12-16 hours a day working in thefields. Since returning to Eagle Pass in November, Ernesto Jr. had been working as a day laborerin Mexico harvesting hay. He planned to re-enroll at Eagle Pass ISD in the second semester andfinish the 1.5 credits so he could graduate in May. After graduation, Ernesto Jr. planned to enlistin the Army, according to his father. The son apparently believed the Army would provide himwith some valuable training since he is no longer very interested in continuing as a farm laborer.Ernesto Jr. also apparently hoped to acquire some college tuition money by joining the Army. In general, Ernesto Sr. thought the instructional technology used in migrant education (i.e., the laptop computers, NovaNET, and Project SMART) helped his children stay in schooland learn. Three of his children (Ernesto Jr., Ana, and Maria) shared the same laptop computerand used separate passwords to access NovaNET courseware over the summer.A-36Discussion The instructional initiatives and technological innovations of the Migrant Education Programs in Texas and Montana have resulted in a congruent curriculum and extended schoolyear for Texas-based migrant students who travel back and forth between Montana and Texasevery Summer with their families. These developments have been made possible by the state-level leadership and interstate collaboration that have been exhibited by Texas, Montana, andother partnering states such as Illinois over the years. Arguably, the services provided by theSidney Summer Migrant Program could not have occurred, much less been maintained, withoutthe relationships that grew out of these collaborative efforts among educators and the variouspartnering agencies. The Montana Office of Public Instruction (MOPI), the Texas Education Agency (TEA), and the Texas Migrant Interstate Project (TMIP) have a history of formal collaboration whichhas resulted in the technology-based approach to instructional continuity and records exchange inmigrant education. This includes the annual televised Spring training conference held inBillings, Montana, sponsored by TEA/TMIP/MOPI for MOPI staff on SMART, NovaNET,NGS, and various issues in migrant education (e.g., student identification, the Red Bag, creditaccrual changes and problems, and TAAS prep and administration). The Fall credit accrualresolution conference, hosted every year in Texas by TMIP, brings together schooladministrators, counselors, and registrars from partnering districts and states to resolve coursecredit issues and problems. This personal contact has also made it easier for staff from differentstates and school districts to contact each other to resolve issues when they arise. As a precursor to implementing the various technological solution strategies, the MOPI-TEA-TMIP collaboration first focused on aligning Montana\u0092s migrant educationinstruction with the Texas State curriculum (the TEKS) and assessment (the TAAS). Once thecurriculum and assessment were aligned, instruction was implemented essentially throughNovaNET and SMART. These projects had customized their curricula to the TEKSspecifications approved by the Texas Education Agency. Customizing these curricula to theneeds of Texas-based migrant students required collaborative relationships betweenTEA/TMIP/MOPI as well as curriculum and software developers at NovaNET Inc., AppleComputer Inc., Montana MET-Net, Texas Tenet, ESC-20 in San Antonio, and the SouthwestRegional Educational Laboratory.A-37Innovations in distance learning and computer-assisted instruction also required that districts build upon a pre-existing technological infrastructure. Without software innovationsdeveloped through the University of Illinois that were subsequently custom-fitted to statecurriculum specifications through private sector marketing efforts by NovaNET Inc., the StateEducation Agencies in Texas and Montana would not have had a computerized state-approvedcurriculum upon which to align their own curricula. Similarly, without the convergence ofinstructional television and satellite broadcasting technology through prior work at the ESC-20,Project SMART would not exist. The Sidney Migrant Project and the Eagle Pass ISD (as well as La Joya, Weslaco, and Pharr ISDs) also have a long history of cooperation, made possible by collaboration at the statelevel. Specifically, this collaboration between TEA, TMIP, and MOPI has resulted in the use ofthe NovaNET lab concept in Montana as well as Project SMART. MOPI's relationship with theIllinois Migrant Council also led to the development and funding of Project ESTRELLA whichsupports an extension of the NovaNET lab through the use of laptop computers. Eagle Pass's migrant students face problems, particularly at the secondary level, in accruing credit and receiving enough sustained academic instruction to take and pass the TAAS.Locally, the Migrant Education Program addresses those problems through a combination ofNovaNET, laptop computers, SMART, the University of Texas Credit-by-Exam option, andvarious course make-up options that include the Saturday Graduation Enhancement classes formigrants who return late to Texas. Counselors and teachers use NGS for obtaining informationon courses taken or completed at other sites; this information guides their instructional planningin ways that benefit the students. Like the Sidney Summer Migrant Education Program, Eagle Pass's migrant services operate in the context of interstate coordination and collaboration, which has made these servicespossible. While local initiatives are needed to implement the services, interventions on the scaleof SMART, ESTRELLA, and NGS required collaboration and dedication of resources at higherinstitutional levels. Only Project SMART has been formally collected student participation and outcome data. According to an evaluation report prepared by META Associates (September 1997), 18states (including Montana) implemented SMART in 1997. Sidney was the largest participatingSMART site in Montana, with the largest student participation at the preschool and elementaryschool levels (which are the levels with the greatest migrant student enrollment). Sidney wasA-38also the only site in Montana to offer a secondary-level SMART program for in-school youth at grades 9-12. The META Associates Report indicated that nine secondary students in Sidneyparticipated in SMART courses in the summer of 1997. Four of these nine students (44 percent)received a half credit for their participation in the 1997 SMART government course. The otherfive secondary students took one of the SMART non-credit-bearing TAAS Prep courses. META Associates also reported an evaluation of Montana\u0092s pilot implementation of NovaNET in 1997. Data were collected on migrant student participation in temporary NovaNETlabs in three sites in Montana (Sidney, Billings, and Hardin) as well as on migrant studentparticipation in NovaNET through the use of laptop computers. Interview data suggested thatone of the main benefits of NovaNET\u0097through either the computer lab or the laptopcomputers\u0097was its capability to help teachers individualize instruction. Anecdotal data,however, suggest that one of the main drawbacks to migrant students\u0092 use of laptop computers asan instructional aid while on the road is access to a telephone line. The technological innovations in distance learning and computer-assisted instruction that have been implemented in Texas and Montana have the potential to promote instructionalcontinuity for Texas-based migrant students. Eagle Pass and Sidney will need to keep theirhardware and software upgraded so that they can stay current with the technical specificationsrequired as the technology for distance learning and computer assisted instruction evolves andimproves. This will require funds to replace and update hardware and software. Major challenges to maintaining the operation at both ends include attracting qualified technical staff to trouble-shoot and maintain the hardware and software applications. Attractingqualified staff to the Eagle Pass area, for example, is difficult because of the low salary offeredby the ISD and because of the general limitations of the border area. Telephone line access isanother major obstacle. Maintaining TMIP\u0092s technical assistance role with the laptops andNovaNET computer applications appears crucial to the continued successful implementation ofthese interventions. NGS student data also needs to be updated in a more timely fashion. Currently, upstream states can receive course completion and course grade information (a) if the family brings awithdrawal form with them when they enroll for the Summer or (b) if the receiving site contactsthe sending site. The first alternative requires continued use of the red bag system and parentresponsibility for school information when transferring between school systems. The latterA-39largely depends on maintaining close working relationships between key records staff of originating and receiving sites.A-40Donna Independent School District, Donna, Texas; Van Buren Intermediate School District, Lawrence, Michigan; and Manatee County Schools, Bradenton, Florida The Donna-Van Buren-Manatee County case, like the case of Eagle Pass-Sidney, illustrates how local districts rely on direct communication and interstate mechanisms such as theTexas Migrant Interstate Program and the Portable Assistance Study Sequence to enhance thecontinuity of education for migrant students. This case differs from the others in that it involvesthree school districts, although reciprocal arrangements are not in place among all three. VanBuren ISD has relationships with Donna ISD, Texas, and with Manatee County schools inFlorida. However, the Texas and Florida sites do not have direct working relationships. Inparticular, this case provides an illustration of the role personal relationships play in promotinginstitutional understanding of shared responsibilities. The Partners Donna Independent School District, Donna Texas Donna Independent School District (ISD) is located in the lower Rio Grande area of Texas, about 240 miles south of San Antonio and just east of McAllen, Texas. This section ofTexas is known as the Valley and is home to the largest concentration of migrant families in thenation. While the economic base of the area is diversifying, agriculture remains the primaryindustry. Cotton, sugar cane, and vegetables are key crops. Migrant labor is not used for cottonand sugar cane. Migrant laborers work with vegetables, picking predominantly onions andcabbage. Other crops that often employ migrant workers in the area include tomatoes, carrots,bell peppers, and lettuce. Few other employment opportunities exist for migrant workers whoreturn to Donna. Non-migrant residents often are employed in agricultural-related work (preparation of fields, driving the tractors), the local school system, or small businesses. The district provides educational services to three-year-olds through grade 12. The district supports 10 elementary campuses, two middle schools, and one high school. Based onthe 1997/98 Academic Excellence Indicator System from the Texas Education Agency (TEA),student enrollment in Donna ISD peaked at 10,500. This enrollment includes 9,698 Hispanicstudents, 146 Caucasian, and 656 who are classified as Asian, Pacific Islander, or NativeAmerican. Eight-eight percent of the student population is economically disadvantaged. Fiftypercent (50 percent) of the students are identified as limited English proficient (LEP).A-41In general, the community holds high expectations for its students that include high school graduation followed by matriculation in college. But migrant students were not especiallysuccessful on the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS). Fifty-eight percent passedReading, 60 percent passed Mathematics, and 54 percent passed Writing as compared to the statestandard of 90 percent for each subject area. Surprisingly, the average attendance rate formigrant students is 93 percent, just one percent below the state standard of 94%. The statestandard for a school district graduation rate is 90 percent. In 1996, 71 percent of the migrantstudents graduated from Donna High School; in 1997, 87 percent were graduated. In 1997, only55 percent of the migrant students who took the TAAS exit exam passed (with just 8 percent ofthe eligible students absent on the test date). Only 39 percent of the migrant students took acollege admissions test (the state standard is 70 percent). As of December 15, 1998, 3,822 students were eligible for the Migrant Education Program in Donna. A total of 1,415 students were served in Donna's Summer migrant program.A large percentage of migrant students move annually to secure seasonal work in agriculture.For FY 98, while most of the districts in the valley are losing migrant students (perhaps due toless intensive identification and recruitment efforts, higher graduation rates, and permanentre-locations to another state), Donna increased slightly (1.12 percent) via its efforts in agency coordination. Migrant workers from Donna usually travel directly to work sites in Michigan, without stopping for other kinds of work. Many of the families go to the southeastern area of Michiganfor cucumber, cherry, asparagus, and grape harvests. Some migrant families who leave duringthe Spring months, send for their children after school is out, and some families return beforeschool starts again in the Fall. Others may not return until November. Based on data obtained inVan Buren, 500-825 students from Donnas ISD migrate to southwest Michigan, with 375 ofthose children enrolled in Van Buren ISD. Donna ISD has a history of communicating with staff at the Van Buren ISD to improve the continuity of instruction that migrant students experience. This cooperation, often supportedby the Texas Migrant Interstate Program (TMIP), has resulted primarily in school transitionservices facilitated by migrant specialists, the use of instructional programs specifically for creditaccrual, and the transfer of student information. Van Buren Intermediate School District, Lawrence MichiganA-42Lawrence, Michigan is nestled in lower southwestern Michigan. The town is located off Interstate 94 in a rural part of the state where farming remains the number one industry. Overthe past 30 years, the area has required the services of a significant migrant labor workforce.Initially, strawberries were the primary crop that required pickers. Today, strawberries havebeen replaced by cucumbers; with potatoes, blueberries, apples, and crop work in vineyards andnurseries contributing to the on-going need for migrant workers. New agricultural technologyhas reduced the volume of work for migrant workers, but migrant labor continues to be needed.The majority of growers in the area consist of family-owned farms. Currently, the largest growerin the area is John Faulkner Farms, which recruits 300-400 migrant families per year for hiscucumber harvest; a similar operation exists in Florida. The Van Buren Intermediate School District (ISD) serves 11 school districts. Its migrant education project provides both school year and summer-term services. School-year services areprovided to migrant students who enroll in 28 local schools during both the Fall and Springmonths. Most of these migrant students do not complete more than one grading period in theMichigan public schools. Seven itinerant resource teachers provide services to migrant childrenby helping with school transitions, providing in-school advocacy, and offering tutorial assistance.The summer project\u0092s services include preschool/day care services, a summer school enrichmentprogram for K-8, and an evening program for older youth. In 1997, 1,420 students were eligiblefor the Migrant Education Program; 780 students were enrolled in either school year and/orSummer-term programs. The Summer program had an average daily attendance of 372 students. Although the home base of most migrant families continues to be either Texas (43 percent of the identified students) or Florida (30 percent of the identified students), increasingnumbers of migrants are originating from Mexico (33 percent in 1997). With this change, thepercentage of students who are limited English proficient (LEP) is also on the rise. Van Buren ISD has a substantial history of working with several school districts in the Rio Grande valley (e.g., Brownsville, Donna, Weslaco, Pharr) and the Texas Migrant InterstateProject (TMIP) to improve the continuity of instruction that migrant students experience. Thiscooperation has resulted in teacher exchanges, participation in each other\u0092s conferences andpre-service training programs, use of credit accrual programs, the transmittal of student information, the administration of the TAAS in Michigan, school transition services, and thetransfer of student information. Recent trends in worker recruitment efforts have increased theA-43significance of coordinating with school districts in the State of Florida (Manatee, Hillsborough, & Polk Counties). Manatee County School District, Manatee County, Florida Manatee County lies along the Gulf of Mexico between Sarasota and Tampa. The county was named for the large, easygoing aquatic animal known as the West Indian Manatee. Alongthe coast, small villages and resort communities populate the barrier islands and bay shores.Inland, in the eastern part of the county, lies rural countryside an area known for its fruit and vegetable production. Six major population centers are located in the county (Bradenton, Palmetto, Anna Maria, Holmes Beach, Bradenton Beach, and Longboat Key). The two largest communities, Bradentonand Palmetto, are on the mainland. Bradenton, the county seat, is the county\u0092s largest city with apopulation of close to 50,000. In the 1940s, food processor Anthony Rossi settled in Bradentonand founded Fruit Industries, a company known worldwide today as Tropicana North America.Palmetto is the agricultural center of the county and is noted especially for tomatoes. The Manatee County School District has 39 schools that include 26 elementary schools, seven middle schools, five high schools and one vocational technical center. The school districtserves about 34,000 students in pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade. Manatee County\u0092s migrant student services include a pre-kindergarten program, an in- class tutoring program for grades K-2, and an after-school tutoring program for students ingrades 9-12. In addition, the county\u0092s Migrant Education Program supports academiccounseling, parental involvement, and outreach and referral services. Every year, more than 2,000 migrant students about seven percent of the total student bodycome to Manatee County schools after their families have worked in other parts of the country in seasonal agriculture. In 1998, more than 1,400 migrant children had registered inManatee County schools since classes began in late August. At least 1,000 more were expectedto enroll throughout the early Fall. Most of the incoming migrant families live in the rural farmcamps of Palmetto and Myakka City. The owners of Faulkner Farms of Lawrence, Michiganhave located their Florida-based farm in Myakka City. Many of the migrant families spend theFall, Winter, and Spring working at the Faulkner Farms site in Myakka and then move toFaulkner Farms in Michigan for the summer.A-44Van Buren ISD in Michigan is the largest recipient of migrant students from Manatee County, largely because Faulkner Farms provides labor camp housing for migrant families itemploys in both states. Faulkner Farms itself operates seasonally in both states, growing andharvesting a variety of fruits and vegetables; thus there is some continuity of employment aswell. Problems Facing Migrant Students \u0093Really, mostly the problems {dealing with educational continuity} are at thesecondary level.\u0094 (Migrant Education Program Coordinator, Donna, Texas) The main problem for home-based Texas and Florida migrant youth who are enrolled in the secondary grades is accruing credits necessary for graduation. In both Texas and Florida,students who migrate often do not complete their course of study in either their home-base stateor the receiving state. With each incomplete course, migrant students repeatedly must try tocatch up with their peers in their schoolwork. Over time, the accumulation and effects ofincomplete coursework lead to problems with mastery of subject matter, grades, and satisfactorycourse completion, which in turn affect attendance and enrollment in school, credit accrual,grade promotion, and high school graduation. Donna ISD and Manatee County reported that the problems for secondary-level migrant students begin when these students either withdraw early withdrawal from school and/or returnlate. With the typical early withdrawal, migrant students miss the last six weeks of school(mid-April through the end of May). With the start of schools scheduled for mid-August, if thestudents return in October or November, they may miss yet another six or more weeks of school.Recent efforts of high schools to install block scheduling have compounded the problem asdifferences in amount of the content covered are substantial when students transfer from a coursewith a traditional schedule to a course with a block schedule and vice versa. The ultimate effect of these events on a student\u0092s education depends on what happens in both the receiving state (in this case, Michigan) and state of origin. If the student does not enrollin a school in Michigan and/or supplemental instructional opportunities are not available, coursecredit for the prior semester's work in Texas or Florida will not be granted or the student will bebehind in the current year's work. If the student does enroll in a Michigan school or summerprogram, this schoolwork may have little utility if the student cannot take the appropriateA-45courses; if the course content is different between sites or out-of-sequence; and if partial credit or full credit for coursework is not issued or accepted by Michigan, Texas, or Florida schools. In addition, upon return to the school district of origin, if there are no opportunities for the students to catch up on the incomplete courses, they will probably remain behind in theirschoolwork. The negative impact of these events quickly escalates for secondary-level studentswho are already at risk of educational failure from other factors related to poverty and mobility.Without intervention, the odds of early school dropout or failure to graduate increases. Although data were not presented to confirm their beliefs, migrant educators in both Donna and Van Buren do not view the effects of migration on continuity of instruction as beingas problematic for elementary grade-level students as it is for secondary-level students. Theybelieve that the educational gaps or deficits created by early withdrawal and/or late entry can beovercome by the remedial services commonly offered at the regular or summer elementaryschool. For example, district officials in Donna believe that the elementary school teacher can overcome the time and learning lost during the regular school year using remedial servicescommonly found within the school. Upon re-enrollment, the elementary teacher is expected tofind out what skills students bring from the receiving state. Based on this assessment, if thestudent is behind or missing skills, the teacher turns to a variety of in-school strategies, such ashomework packets or the use of a tutor. Similarly, migrant staff in Michigan view problems with instructional continuity as considerably more severe for secondary-level students. The Van Buren staff believed that thegeneral pre-school, elementary school, and lower middle school curriculum require less precisionin designing appropriate instruction than is needed for the subject matter-specific courses at thesecondary school level. The major problems experienced by secondary-level migrant students originating from Donna and Manatee have been: 1) the loss of instructional time, 2) the lack of information toguide best placement in Van Buren ISD's summer program and regular school year services, and3) the lack of procedures to ensure that students receive credit for work done at Van Buren whenthey arrive at schools in Texas and Florida. Both educators and parents feel a sense of urgencythat these problems be solved.A-46Van Buren\u0092s staff were very aware that parents (and to some degree, students) wanted to make sure they received appropriate instruction. These parents also wanted to ensure that upontheir return to schools in Texas or Florida, their children received credit for work they did inMichigan. Promising Practices The primary needs for interstate coordination among Donna, Van Buren, and Manatee focus on helping secondary students to catch up on instruction missed due to a migrant move, toidentify the appropriate instructional programs and/or courses of study needed, and to ensuresecondary-level credit accrual. Promising Practices in Van Buren ISD Efforts to meet the needs of children who migrate to Lawrence, Michigan from Donna, Texas start with a program of information-sharing. During the Winter months, Van Buren staffuse their own database to produce lists of students with prior summer enrollments in Michigan.These lists are often hand-carried by the site administrator to interstate events/meetings in Texas.At these meetings, the site administrator asks the appropriate district official in Texas to checkon student attendance at their schools. If the children are enrolled, Van Buren ISD staff requestinformation on the student\u0092s grade level placement, test results, and courses of study. This information is used to help organize Van Buren\u0092s Summer program. The Summer project operates for approximately 40 days (beginning in late June and ending in early August).The project uses the pleasant, well-maintained Van Buren ISD campus facilities which are setback from a rural road in Lawrence. The air-conditioned campus includes three buildings thathouse the administrative offices, instructional classrooms, related supportive service facilities(cafeteria, gymnasiums, auditoriums) and a technology/vocational center. The full-day Summerproject provides services to children who range in age from two and one-half years to 21 years. The Summer project\u0092s services include preschool/day care services, a summer school enrichment program for K-8, and an evening program for older youth. The K-8 curriculum is nottightly coordinated with instructional programs in Texas or Florida. Basic instruction in reading,math, and ESL is provided to enrolled students. Teachers administer an informal assessment toidentify student needs. Each teacher develops thematic units that draw upon available resources.A-47The evening school program is eight weeks long, with classes held Monday through Friday from 6:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. It provides enrichment services (e.g., instruction in life skills,exposure to computers) to middle school students. Secondary-level youth are offeredopportunities to make up course credits or to work on subjects that they are failing. New arrivalsto the U.S. can develop and improve their English language skills. In general, Van Buren ISDstaff provide assistance to help migrant students complete a Portable Assisted Study Sequence(PASS) correspondence course or a correspondence course from the University of Texas.One-half credit is earned in a subject when a secondary-level student successfully completes agiven course. The evening school also provides opportunities for students to take the TAAS.After the close of the summer program, continued support is provided to individual students whoare completing summer coursework. For students who remain in Lawrence and re-enroll in school when it opens in September, migrant/bilingual resource teachers who work throughout the ISD help with schooltransitions, provide in-school advocacy, and offer tutorial assistance. These staff help to improvethe academic counseling that secondary-level migrant youth receive that determines whichschool-year courses they should take while they reside in Michigan. Upon withdrawal from Van Buren ISD, the resource teachers are expected to ensure that an informal transcript (with days enrolled, days present, and some test data) is prepared and ifpossible sent back with each student as they return to Texas or Florida. Upon receipt, Texas orFlorida school officials can request a formal transcript that will contain more information if thestudent was registered through the first grading period (nine weeks). Essentially, themigrant/bilingual resource teachers act as a coordinating mechanism in that they negotiate withboth local educators and the sending district on behalf of the migrant students. The process of exchanging information between districts is critical to ensuring that the needs of secondary-level migrant students are met, but it is not easily implemented. Previously,the MSRTS never fully gave Van Buren ISD staff the information they needed to identify thespecial services the secondary-level youth needed or the credits they needed to graduate. Theinformation also was insufficient to convince the sending school that students had completedparticular work. Van Buren ISD staff reported to researchers that they always had to pick up thephone and make a personal contact. Occasionally, parents who returned to Van Buren the next summer would complain that they took the paperwork back to the originating district with no result. Notwithstanding the timeA-48elapsed, Van Buren ISD staff then would call the building principal or school counselor and try to resolve the credit accrual issues with the school. The researchers observed that person-to-person information exchange is not always successful the first time and often requires extensive follow-up activities before actualinformation is received. One staff member stated that \u0093the process is not perfect you must continue to bug people to send information.\u0094 For example, requests for information that weresent to several schools in Texas did not result in responses until a representative from the schooldistrict attended the previous summer\u0092s pre-service training session for Van Buren ISD staff.The representative then was given another list of Texas students and he did send back all of thestudents\u0092 records. The Migrant Education Program site administrator at Van Buren ISD is convinced that personal relationships are a critical ingredient for successful interstate cooperation andcoordination. Consequently, staff time and money have been expended to increase the frequencyof person-to-person interactions between Van Buren ISD staff and district personnel in Texas.Van Buren staff participate in the annual meetings and conferences held in Texas where they canmeet face-to-face with their Texas counterparts. Officials from key originating districts areinvited to address Van Buren\u0092s summer program staff during pre-service and in-service training.Teachers from the originating schools are hired to work in the Van Buren ISD summer program,and then act as advocates for their students upon their return to Texas. Clearly, continuousnetworking to develop and sustain relationships and follow-up activities are viewed asprerequisites for effective interstate coordination. It is also important to note that the staff of the Texas Migrant Interstate Project (TMIP) area valuable resource in these information-sharing efforts. The Texas Migrant Interstate Projectplays an important intermediary role with cases where 1) direct communication with a school didnot work or 2) it was not possible to contact a district official because the school was officiallyclosed for the summer. If a personal contact with school building personnel in Texas previouslyhas not been established, it has become more efficient to call TMIP staff and have them initiatecontact with the building-level personnel. Texas Migrant Interstate Project staff are rated highlyby the Van Buren staff for their follow-up in obtaining student information and/or resolvingcredit accrual difficulties. The year before this study was conducted, the relationship model was extended to Florida through the personal initiative of one teacher. Using her own funds, the evening programA-49coordinator traveled to Florida during her winter vacation to introduce herself to counselors at key originating schools as well as to PASS program officials. Based on agreements she struckwith Florida educators, Van Buren\u0092s evening program coordinator faxed school officials inManatee County and Hillsborough County lists of students who had prior enrollments in both theVan Buren ISD and the two counties in Florida. She asked the local migrant counselors toevaluate the students\u0092 transcripts at the home-base school to ascertain what the migrant studentswould need at the end of the year to complete their course work and, if possible, to start a PASScourse. Unfortunately, the Hillsborough relationship broke down. In Manatee, however,information on students who had started PASS courses was delivered to Van Buren ISD whenthe Manatee contact person arrived for the Van Buren ISD pre-service. Eight of the 28 studentsidentified with a history of traveling to Van Buren from Manatee actually worked on a PASScourse based on information shared between the school districts. In this case, staff of the FloridaMigrant Interstate Project (FMIP) also drew praise for their support in helping the districts cometogether. After working with the PASS program, Van Buren staff did suggest that the quality ofPASS program materials could be upgraded and they were unsure how tightly the materials werealigned to Florida\u0092s new academic standards. No formal evaluation has been conducted of either the process or the outcomes of interstate coordination activities between Van Buren ISD in conjunction with Texas and Florida.Nevertheless, the Van Buren site administrator firmly believes that supporting older youth withsecondary credit accrual activities is important to their graduation because \u0093those success storieswill trickle down and get the family to be more conscientious about sending all of their kids toschool and expecting them to graduate.\u0094 Promising Practices in Manatee County, Florida When the evening summer program coordinator from the Van Buren Schools came to Manatee County over the Christmas vacation to visit the migrant families working at FaulknerFarms, she sparked a relationship between the two districts' migrant education programs. Thedirectors of the two programs met subsequently at the 1998 national migrant conference. At thismeeting, they discussed their mutual desire to have a better relationship with Faulkner Farms andwith each other in order to work more effectively with the migrant families as they moved backand forth between Florida and Michigan. An informal agreement was struck to ensure thatstudent information from the Manatee County teachers would be shared with the Summer schoolteachers in Michigan for the Faulkner Farms children they both served. In June 1998, theManatee County Migrant Specialist visited the Van Buren ISD Summer school program shortlyA-50before it began for the Florida students. She took with her student information forms on the Faulkner Farms children enrolled in PASS programs and at Myakka City Elementary School inManatee County. The PASS form provided Van Buren staff with a description of the courses inwhich secondary-level migrant students had enrolled. The Portable Assisted Study Sequence (PASS) Program was developed in California in the late 1970s as an approach to secondary school dropout prevention. Florida beganimplementing PASS in 1993 after determining that PASS courses met Florida Public Educationcurriculum requirements. Florida's PASS Program offers 32 credit-bearing courses in art, health,language arts, life skills, mathematics, science, and social studies. These semester-lengthcourses consist of five units of study and students must pass all five unit tests to get credit for thecourse. The Portable Assisted Study Sequence is a collection of semi-independent public education courses for students in grades 9-12. The program allows students to participate in highschool classes and accumulate credits toward graduation through home-study or as they travelwith their family for employment-related reasons. In Florida, the dominant PASS modelinvolves home-study for intra-state migrant students whose families tend to pull them out ofschool during the academic year for agricultural or fishing work with the family. This worktakes place either in the local school district or involves a temporary move to another county inFlorida. Information summaries on elementary grade students were developed for Van Buren in 1998 by the guidance counselor at Myakka City Elementary and were designed to transmitstudent performance information useful for summer school placement and instructional planning(e.g., grade level, reading level, name of basal text). This new procedure now supersedes the oldprocedure in which Van Buren ISD staff asked the FMIP retroactively to provide any knowninformation about migrant children who had arrived in Michigan from Florida. The promise of greater effectiveness in working with interstate migrant students prompted Manatee County to explore building a similar relationship with school districts inTexas. Co-funded by the County\u0092s Migrant Education Program and the Florida InterstateMigrant Program, Manatee\u0092s migrant specialist and other staff traveled in February 1997 to theRio Grande Valley to observe the migrant programs in Donna, Weslaco, LaJoya, andBrownsville. Their objective was to develop personal relationships and knowledge of schoolingpractices in Texas for the future benefit of migrant students shared between Florida and Texas. Promising Practices in Donna, TexasA-51In Donna, Texas, migrant funds may be used for a range of interventions that meet the needs of migrant students, fit with the campus improvement plan, and mesh with the mission andgoal of the school district. All 13 campuses are Title 1 \u0093schoolwide\u0094 programs. Donna\u0092sMigrant Education Program coordinator does not see a problem with the schoolwide approach toserving migrant children at the elementary schools. Elementary school services are the same forall children with the exception of some supplemental clothing and medical/health services thatare provided to migrant children. However, starting at the middle school level, Donna\u0092s MigrantEducation Program coordinator believes it is key to maintain a special focus on the intent andpurposes of the Migrant Education Program. Donna ISD\u0092s educational interventions targeted to the needs of migrant students include: 1) Jostens Integrated Learning System, 2) Help One Student Succeed (HOSTS), 3) MichaelEaton Reading-Writing Program, 4) SRA reading kits, 5) Content Mastery (in-school tutorial), 6)Sharon Wells diagnostic-prescriptive instruction, 7) Reading Recovery, 8) Migrant Tutorial, 9)Project SMART, 10) American Preparatory Institute for grades 10-12, 11) Extended Year(Summer) Program, 12) Credit Retrieval System, 13) Instructional aides in classrooms, 14)Essential Learning Systems computer reading program, and 15) six parent involvementinitiatives. Intervention with secondary-level youth begins with the three Migrant Education Specialists that work in the district. The specialists are certified counselors who make sure thatcredits are accrued, grades are consolidated, and migrant students enroll in a catch-up oraccelerated tutorial program when needed. In the Spring, the specialists make a series of announcements to any students who are planning to withdraw early. These announcements ask the students to give the school two weeksnotice of their forthcoming withdrawal (informing both the regular classroom teachers and themigrant education office). Announcements are not only made via the school intercom butthrough pre-programmed telephone messages to the migrant students\u0092 homes. Upon receivingnotice from a student, a withdrawal record with course information is prepared and given to thestudents who plan to enroll in an out-of-state school. In addition, once the receiving schooldistrict gets the withdrawal information in hand, Donna ISD counselors answer calls fromreceiving school counselors questioning what will be needed for partial credit or course credit forthe Spring semester.A-52Approximately one-third of the migrant student population that withdraws early makes arrangements to \u0093work ahead\u0094 via a University of Texas correspondence course (or via aprogram prepared by the regular classroom teacher) that prepares them to complete theircoursework through the credit-by-exam option. This option enables students to take a test; if thestudent passes the test, full credit for a course or courses is granted before they depart. The otherstudents are informed that they can take a PASS course, apply for a University of Texascorrespondence course, or follow up with the PASS program offered at the receiving site. Students often use the PASS program, as it is used more frequently in the school districts the students move to in other states. The PASS program is slightly more difficult for districtofficials in Donna to manage because they must copy all of the materials for the participatingstudents. In comparison, the University of Texas correspondence course program sends allneeded materials to the school at no cost to the school or students. When students return in the Fall, they are processed through the migrant education office. Students are asked if they attended a northern school while they were away. If the student didattend school, s/he is asked for information on grades received or credits accrued to be submittedto the registrar and his or her respective counselor. Student information from an enrollment inMichigan is returned by hand, fax, or mail. Students who accumulated sufficient course credits(or worked ahead) are enrolled and given a new course schedule. Students who did not enroll inschool, did not accumulate all course credits needed, and/or who missed too much of the firstsix-week period, are enrolled in the basic program and assigned to the migrant tutorial program. Most secondary-level migrant students are placed in the migrant tutorial that has been in operation for ten years. Migrant students attend the migrant tutorial program during independentstudy periods and can use the tutorial to catch up in the Fall or to accelerate instruction in theSpring. The tutorial program is staffed by three full-time teachers and one part-time certifiedteacher. Currently, there is growing pressure to add more teachers, given the number of migrantstudents who are enrolled in the tutorial program. The Tutorial Program. The tutorial program in Donna is housed in a portable building that is connected to the high school via a short walkway. Inside, the portable unit consists of tworooms, approximately 30 feet by 30 feet each. The passageway between the two rooms is open.Throughout the two rooms are six clusters of tables, with 40 students filling almost every seat.Attendance each period ranges from 35 to 50 students. While the rooms are not quiet, andA-53perhaps not ideal for studying, there is not a disruptive level of noise. The walls are adorned with posters, materials, and school rules usually seen in high school classrooms. It is a very busy place. About one third of the students work quietly and independently. Another third observe the researchers who are visiting their classrooms. The remainder areworking with the teachers in small groups or in one-to-one conversations. The studentsrepresent four grade levels and can work in four subject areas: English, History, Mathematics,and Science. The classes are conducted by four teachers (three work on a full-time basis and oneteacher works part-time). The lead teacher, who carries the largest caseload (English I, II, III,IV, U.S. History, World Geography, Economics, and World History), came out of retirement towork in the migrant tutorial. She is joined by three colleagues. One handles Algebra I and II,Geometry, and Project SMART Geometry; another teaches Algebra I; and a third, another retiredteacher, handles Biology I & II, Chemistry I, Physical Science, and Anatomy & Physiology. The students attend the tutorial for 90 minutes per day, two to three times per week. Some students will come to the tutorial during their lunch break to accelerate their studies.Students often work with instructional \u0093packets\u0094 (designed by the tutorial teacher or a classroomteacher) that include photocopied content and worksheets. In some cases, the teachers havehighlighted the \"important\" sections in textbooks for the students which are a highly valuedresource by the students. In fact, the highlighted textbooks disappear occasionally from the roomfor unauthorized use. Other students use the tutorial to work on PASS programs materials orUniversity of Texas correspondence courses. If a student is completing work from the prior year and passes the exit test, the tutorial teachers sends that student\u0092s grades directly to the registrar. If a student is catching up on workmissed during the current year, the grades are sent to the regular classroom teacher, who makesthe final decision about course grades. An important program component is goodcommunication with the classroom teacher on two issues. First, the regular classroom teachersneed to agree on the instructional priorities. Second, the regular classroom teachers need to beassured that the instructional packets are of sufficient academic rigor. In the 1996/97 school year, over 1,400 instructional packets (each equaling six weeks work) were completed by the students. For students who have fallen severely behind (beyondone semester), they also receive preparation for the TAAS in reading, writing, and basic mathskills through the INVEST Learning program or JOSTENS program (both are computer-basedinstruction programs).A-54As note earlier, Donna ISD offers over 15 different schoolwide educational interventions for students who are at risk of failing. Several of those interventions are of particular importanceto migrant students and are briefly described below. TAAS Tutoring . The TAAS Migrant tutoring program serves migrant students in grades 10-12 who have not passed the Exit-Level TAAS. Students are scheduled for the respectivesubject area that is needed and are served by a certified teacher. This staff member is trained intest taking strategies, accelerated instruction and cooperative learning. Successfulimplementation of this program is based on the mastery level in the subject areas of need and thepercentage of students passing the Exit Level TAAS Test. Project SMART (Summer Migrants Access Resources Through Technology). Project SMART is a migrant-funded summer program that is designated for migrant students who do notmigrate during the summer months. This program serves students in grades PreK-12 andincorporates language acquisition, reading, science, mathematics, and social studies. Theinstructional delivery of this program utilizes televised instruction via public broadcastingstations and cable operators. Project SMART instructional staff assist the regular summer schoolteacher with SMART lessons via television monitors. Staff development for project staff isincorporated with the training provided for regular summer staff program. Effective programimplementation is measured by results from TAAS, Iowa Test of Basic Skills, passing rate fromone grade level to the next, and the graduation rate of migrant students. Credit Retrieval System. The Credit Retrieval System provides students an intensive individualized program to make up the essential elements necessary to pass a subject. Studentswho have failed a core subject during a six-week reporting period are eligible for this type ofprogram. Teachers are responsible for filling out a prescription form and an instructional packetfor each student failing a six-week period. The instructional time is contingent on the quantity ofessential elements that need to be mastered. Students will not earn a grade above 74. In the\u0093accelerated\u0094 component of this program, students are provided with a self-paced study programthat enables them with an opportunity to test out of a core area class. The students will have theoption of testing without study guidance. The Credit Retrieval System program is consideredsuccessful if each participating student earns credit in the class or classes enrolled. DiscussionA-55The main problem for home-based Texas and Florida migrant youth who are enrolled in the secondary grades is accruing credits necessary for graduation. In both Texas and Florida,students who migrate often do not complete their course of study in either their home-base stateor the receiving state. Over time, the consequences of incomplete coursework are low masteryof subject matter, poor grades, and unsatisfactory course completion. These variables are well-documented as negative influences on attendance and enrollment in school, credit accrual, gradepromotion, and high school graduation. For that reason, the primary educational objectives for migrant educators in Donna, Van Buren, and Manatee County are: 1) to provide supplemental educational opportunities forstudents to catch up on instruction missed due to a migrant move, 2) to properly select and placestudents in the appropriate instructional programs and/or courses of study needed, and 3) toensure the on-going accrual of secondary credits needed for graduation. Migrant educators in each district recognize the value and need for cooperation, coordination, and collaboration if they are to attain maximal effectiveness in educating migrantstudents. Receiving schools like the summer program in Van Buren need information toproperly design, select, and place students in appropriate instructional programs and/or coursesof study so that they can achieve instructional congruence in what is being taught as defined byAllington and Johnston (1986). The originating schools in Donna and Manatee need Van Burento provide, follow up, or support appropriate instruction to keep the students on track with theirstudies so they do not fall so far behind that they give up. They also need Van Buren to sendrecords that can be used to document course credits when the students return home. Finally, thereceiving schools in Michigan need to rely on staff in Donna and Manatee who are motivatedand able to ensure that students enroll in a catch-up or an accelerated tutorial program if needed,grades are consolidated, and appropriate credits are accrued. At the heart of these procedures is communication among the staff of each program, school, and district. The development of personal relationships more than formal systems or advanced technology seems to characterize how these procedures are carried out. The migrant counselors, teachers, and resource specialists in all three districts talk about the importance ofmeeting face-to-face with each other to establish working relationships. They see themselves asa \u0093human network\u0094 that works to solve barriers migrant children face. For the most part,secondary-level students are the priority for their energies and attention. Although Texas,Florida, and Michigan use computers to store some student information, the migrant educatorsuses fairly basic technologies by current standards (telephone, fax, mail, in-person meetings,A-56hand-carried delivery by students/parents) to transfer information. Since neither Michigan and Florida are part of the New Generation System (NGS) consortium, the prospects for transfer ofinformation by electronic means appear low at the current time. The interventions the \u0093network\u0094 leverages to enhance educational continuity include a mix of home-grown and state-supported innovations. Migrant student-specific instructionalprograms (i.e., in-school tutorials in Texas and the summer evening programs in Michigan) arekey delivery systems. Within these programs, a number of instructional interventions are oftenavailable for students to continue their academic progress (e.g., instruction packets, PASS, UTcorrespondence courses, Project SMART, TAAS prep, computer-assisted instruction labs,credit-by-exam). In several cases (i.e., PASS and University of Texas correspondence courses), the instructional interventions may be completed as independent studies and do not requireattendance in a tutorial or summer program but do require some forms of institutional support(e.g., grading and awarding of credits). Keeping the network alive is no small feat. It requires resources to build and maintain relationships, to improve information transfer, and to develop, update, and evaluate theinstructional interventions. Special resources like the Texas Migrant Interstate Program are also needed to fill in gaps when the local school counselors can not be reached. Finally, strongleadership is necessary to marshal and allocate resources. In cases where dedicated professionals do work together, the positive impact of coordination efforts on the continuity of instruction for individual students can be striking. Butthis approach must address a number of significant challenges if the impact on studentachievement is to be as great as desired by educators in Donna, Van Buren, and Manatee County.Continuous challenges include providing: \u0095 Time and resources for staff to pursue and maintain a \u0093relentless\u0094 approach to meeting the special needs of secondary migrant students; \u0095 Reasonable caseloads for migrant counselors in the regular school year; \u0095 More efficient information-processing and management capabilities that eliminate delays in transferring and summarizing migrant student information (including alternative sources of data when originating schools are closed during the summer months);A-57\u0095 Resources to design and update the instructional programs (to meet changing course requirements and state standards and to effectively accommodate student needs for particular courses that are not available in the district in which they temporarily enroll); \u0095 Resources to guide continuous improvement of the interstate efforts via on-going and objective evaluations of both the process and results; \u0095 A means to guarantee students that partial or full credit for the work they have done will be granted, or else the economic pressures for students to work versus study will prove difficult to surmount. It is interesting to note that the suggestions cited in Volume I by Melaville and Black (1991) as critical to successful collaboration are evident in the Donna-Van Buren-ManateeCounty case. As partners, district staff have spent time learning how their counterparts operateand have built respect for each other\u0092s needs. They engaged in periodic communications toestablish rapport with key players, to conduct joint planning, and to keep all other staff wellinformed. Both formal and informal communication structures were used and their efforts weresupported by higher levels of administration. The sites share a common objective: to helpsecondary migrant students accrue the credits needed to graduate from their home-base school.Although tested at times, the credibility of the districts as partners has been sustained bycommitment to their promises. By enacting these processes, the staff in the Donna -Van Buren-Manatee County case have demonstrated how personal relationships and communicationcan play an important role in promoting institutional understanding of shared responsibilities fordelivering appropriately coordinated educational services to migrant children. In this case study, educators did report that most of the problems with educational continuity concern secondary-level students. However, they also stated that summer migranteducation programs, especially in receiving states, make an important contribution to theacademic progress of pre-school and elementary-level migrant students as well. In fact, thesummer programs may be more important now than they were at an earlier time. Currently, as part of their education reforms, many school districts in Texas, Florida, and elsewhere are funding extended school-year services to help all children learn what they failed tomaster during the regular school year. Migrant children lose the opportunity to participate in andbenefit from these local summer programs when they migrate with their families in search oftemporary or seasonal work. If the migrant children move to a place where there is no summerprogram, they will not only stay behind, but will fall farther behind their non-migrant peers whoA-58are enrolled in the Summer programs offered in the home school district. Thus, ensuring access to Summer program services for pre-school and elementary-level migrant children is a vital rolethat the Migrant Education Program now plays.A-59Yuma School District #1, Yuma, Arizona and Alisal School District, Salinas, California The Yuma-Alisal case study differs from the previous cases in three ways. First, it does not involve migrant students sent from Texas; rather, it involves reciprocal exchanges of studentsbetween two districts: Alisal in Salinas, California and Yuma School District #1 in Arizona.Second, curriculum alignment, not credit accrual, is the primary issue in this case study becausethe two districts share only elementary-level students. Third, it offers the most straightforwardexample of direct collaboration between two districts with identifiable shared students and thesharing of resources toward the resolution of mutually identified problems. The PartnersYuma School District #1 (SD1), Yuma, Arizona Yuma sits on the Colorado River and borders California, only a few miles from the Mexican border. Migrants in the Yuma area work with lettuce, cauliflower, broccoli, onions,and citrus. Except for citrus, they are the same kinds of crops as in the Salinas area. Migrantsengage in all aspects of agricultural work, from planting to tending crops to harvesting toprocessing. The agricultural area centers around the Salton Sea. Major employers are D'Arrigio, TNA, Dole, Nunes, Norton, Fresh Choice, and New Star. TNA employs large numbers of migrants in both the Salinas and Yuma areas. Those families aremore likely to know that work is waiting for them, and in what vicinity. They lose a little lessschool time in the transition between sites than do other families. Most migrant families have a base in either Yuma or Salinas and some own their own homes. About 30 families who travel between Salinas-Yuma also work in Mexico part of theyear. Since parents are trying to get their children to attend the same school for the entire schoolyear, the children may have a permanent home with relatives, even if the parents do not. Yuma has one high school district, grades 9-12, and four K-8 districts that feed into it; Yuma SD1 is one of the four K-8 districts. The Yuma area represents at least half of all migrantstudents in the state of Arizona. Approximately 1200-1400 migrant-qualified students are enrolled in Yuma SD1. Increasingly, the students stay throughout the school year, but evenA-60within a school year, there is substantial movement of migrant students among schools within the district. About half actually move during the year, and at least half of those who move go to theSalinas valley area. Students from Salinas start coming in mid-October through the end ofNovember. They return to Salinas at Spring break. The majority lose 3-4 days of school.Parents try to get their children into school right away, in part so they can start working;however, they need a street address in order to enroll in school. Yuma SD1 dedicates about a third of its migrant funds to pre-school programming. Migrant pre-school is conducted on an outreach basis. Twenty-two migrant instructional aidesare based in schools in the morning and conduct outreach in the afternoons. They identifylocations where groups of parents and children gather, whether in homes or common rooms inapartment complexes. They provide families with packets of crayons, paper, glue and otheritems and show them how to work with children on early childhood and school preparationskills. At the elementary level, the instructional aides work within regular classrooms. Ten of the 17 elementary schools are Title I schoolwide programs, six are targeted assistance sites, andone does not have a Title I program. In any of these settings, migrant assistants are mandated togive priority service to migrant students. Each of the four junior high schools has a migrant aide who works with migrant students under the direction of classroom teachers, mostly in English as a second language (ESL). Thenature of English as a second language services in Yuma SD1 varies from school to school. Itmay be explicit ESL instruction or sheltered-content English classes. Only two schools havebilingual services; one of them has begun a two-way bilingual education program, and in theother, the use of Spanish is not very structured. The district encourages teachers to obtain thestate ESL endorsement, using a variety of sources. Most schools have one or two ESL-endorsedteachers per grade level. For four years, the district also has employed a junior high school advisor for migrant students who reviews student records to identify students who need help, so that they mayreceive additional assistance to prepare them for high school. The district sponsors summerschool, primarily for Title I students. The summer school charges tuition, but the MigrantEducation Program provides tuition assistance for migrant students to participate in the program.A-61Yuma has made local accommodations on behalf of educational continuity for migrant students, as seen in the decision of Pecan Grove Elementary School not to move to a year-roundschedule because they realized migrant students from Alisal would lose considerableinstructional time due to the mismatch in breaks. A year-round calendar would mean school wasnot in session when many students arrived. Alisal School District, Salinas, California Salinas, California has a 7-12 secondary district, two K-6 districts (including Alisal), and two K-8 districts. Alisal Union School District encompasses the eastern side of the city ofSalinas in Monterey County, California. A majority of the district's students are limited inEnglish proficiency, and 40 percent qualify for Migrant Education. The district serves gradesK-6; when students move into secondary school, they also move into a different school district.Other districts within Salinas that enroll migrant students, including those who move betweenSalinas and Yuma, Arizona have been invited to participate in planning between Alisal andYuma but have done so only sporadically. The Salinas area is known for its agriculture. It was the setting of many of John Steinbeck's works, including The Grapes of Wrath , which described the movement of farm workers from Oklahoma to California during the years of the Depression. After World War II,Hispanic workers, primarily from Mexico, began to dominate farm labor. The major crops inand around Salinas include lettuce, cabbage, artichokes, cauliflower, strawberries, onions,asparagus, and Brussels sprouts. Migrant workers are involved in every aspect of the crops, fromplanting to harvesting to processing and packaging. The agricultural work season begins in earlySpring and lasts into the Fall. Families that migrate to Yuma leave in the largest numbers aroundThanksgiving and begin to return in February to look for work and housing, if necessary. A Fall 1997 count revealed 331 Alisal students who travel between Salinas and Yuma. These students do not differ from other local migrant students in terms of their socioeconomicstatus, language proficiency, ethnicity, or other significant characteristics. About half are basedin Salinas; the other half are based in Yuma. Alisal USD offers a variety of instructional services for migrant students, designed to overcome the educational problems faced by migrant students in general. Migrant Education inAlisal USD supports after-school tutoring, Saturday school as well as summer and intersessionschool.A-62The migrant program also assembles Continuous Learning Packets that give students additional practice in grade-level skills. These packets are provided for intersessions andSummer breaks for students not attending formal migrant programs during those times. Parentsand students are oriented to their use, and parents sign off to verify the students have done thework. In addition, as packets are returned, migrant program staff reviews the work to make sureit is correct, and if so, may issue another packet. Recently, educators decided to use summer school to promote faster English acquisition. Therefore, at the time of the site visit, most instruction was in English, using sheltered methods.Of 16 summer school teachers, four were paid by \"core\" funds (basic education funds) and 12from migrant funds. Although all the Title I sites operate as schoolwides, and students areplaced in classes according to their language proficiency, students in summer school and othersupplemental services are served and grouped by funding source. In other words, the teacherspaid from Migrant Education funds served migrant students exclusively. This follows a staterequirement, not a locally instituted policy. Problems Facing Migrant Students In the early 1990s, teachers in Yuma would comment that their migrant students \u0093left doing well and came back falling behind,\u0094 referring to both their English proficiency levels andacademic achievement. The decline was most apparent in English. Teachers in Salinas weresaying the same thing about students who left for Yuma. In both cases, the perceptions werebased on observations, not on collected language test scores or academic data. Theseobservations led to dialogue between the districts that in turn uncovered several sources ofeducational disruption. Students who migrate between Alisal School District in Salinas, California and Yuma, Arizona suffer educational disruption in a number of ways. First, most of the students areSpanish dominant, and they receive a bilingual program in Salinas but English-only instructionin Yuma. Second, many families do not obtain important documents such as withdrawal slipsand other academic information before leaving a district which causes delayed entry into theirnew school. Therefore, students arrive at each district without important information. Third,instructional time is lost during transit and while parents look for housing and work. The issueof secondary school credit accrual is not relevant in this case study because the two districtsshare only elementary students.A-63The primary difference between Yuma SD1 and Alisal USD lies in its service to LEP students. Yuma provides no bilingual services, in part because of the lack of bilingual personnel.Previously, LEP students were placed strictly according to grade level and language assessmentaccording to the locally adopted measure, the IDEA Proficiency Test (IPT). Limited EnglishProficient migrant students are served for the most part in mainstream classes receiving whateverlanguage assistance the school provides, usually in the form of ESL. Alisal, as previously stated,provides a comprehensive bilingual program with substantial instruction in Spanish, but with aseparate set of classes taught through sheltered English methods for families who declinebilingual services. The transition between all-English and bilingual instruction causes majordisruption for students. Little if any academic information was available to help teachers andinform instruction at the classroom level in both districts. Teachers in both districts are hampered by the lack of information about newly arrived migrant students, particularly their English proficiency and current academic levels. Yuma usesthe IDEA Proficiency Test (IPT). Alisal USD uses the Bilingual Syntax Measure (BSM) as itslanguage proficiency assessment upon entry. Annually after that, language development ismonitored through a locally developed instrument called the ADEPT Alisal Development of English Proficiency Test. While most families know that they should ask for withdrawal slips and health records before leaving a district, one secretary said that fewer than 50 percent of families inform theschool of their imminent departure. There are several difficulties in facilitating records transfer, whether between Yuma and Alisal USD or any other sites. The demise of MSRTS has meant a loss of health and academicrecords transfer capabilities. The difficulties are compounded by the need to integrate migrantrecords with the new state STAR system, a comprehensive database. The migrant portion isreferred to as COE/STAR, including information on the Certificate of Eligibility. Local districts in California, such as Alisal USD, do not have migrant -purchased computers; therefore, the computerized database for COE information can be found only at thecounty office. District personnel must obtain COE information from that office by telephone orfax. State rules prohibit purchase of computers with Migrant Education funds by local districts;they are reserved for the county programs funded directly by the state. For that reason, studentswho migrate between Salinas and Yuma are identified through a COE hand count.A-64As noted earlier, Yuma has one high school district, 9-12, and four K-8 districts that feed into it. Salinas has a 7-12 secondary district, two K-6 districts (including Alisal), and two K-8districts. The mismatch in the grade spans causes further difficulties in communicating aboutstudents in grades 7-8. Although the problem of lost instructional time was not specifically addressed by the districts, both agreed that about three or four days are lost during the move and search for workand housing. Workers travel between Yuma and Salinas with no particular guarantee ofemployment or pre-arranged housing. Often they look for work and procure housing beforeenrolling the children in school because the children cannot be enrolled without a street address.Therefore, several days of school time might be lost before a family secures a street addressqualifying a student to register in a specific school. Promising Practices The Yuma-Alisal case focuses on mutually identified needs and solutions; therefore, much of the information gained from Yuma duplicates the information from Alisal. However,the two districts operate quite differently, and thus the local accommodations to migrant studentsare unique. Promising Practices in Yuma School District #1 When the problems of migrant students were being discussed locally in the early 1990s, the Director of Federal Projects in Yuma asked the migrant records clerks to identify the schoolsin Salinas the students had attended. She then contacted the head of migrant programs in AlisalSchool District and requested a meeting in 1991 to discuss mutual concerns about shared migrantstudents. As a result of this meeting, personnel from both districts agreed that these were \u0093shared students, not belonging to one or the other.\u0094 That attitude led to agreement to minimizedifferences in services, most clearly in the type of language assistance programs provided tostudents. Subsequent meetings identified the kinds of information that teachers needed in orderto begin serving newly arrived students appropriately as soon as possible. Use of the internetand e-mail to exchange data seemed a real possibility for both school districts. Though directelectronic communication between teacher-to-teacher or site-to-site was preferable because ofA-65the lag inherent in sending information through a central data repository such as California's regional offices. The greatest coordination effort of these trading partners was the creation of a migrant student identification card by Yuma School District bearing such information as each state'smigrant student ID number, the student\u0092s name, parents\u0092 names, date of birth, prior school, andteacher\u0092s e-mail address. With this information, the receiving school can contact the sendingschool and/or teacher to determine correct placement for grade and language of instruction. Theinformation can also be used to place students in other appropriate services if so indicated.Teachers can contact each other for information for appropriate classroom instruction anddetailed information on a student's academic performance. E-mail also can be used for studentsto maintain contact with former teachers and classmates. An electronic template was devised by Yuma and contains the kinds of information agreed to by teachers and administrators from both districts. Two teachers from Yuma andAlisal piloted the use of the student identification card during 1997-98. Teachers in Yuma andAlisal began exchanging information about students. Schools have some flexibility about whoand when the electronic template is filled out. In some schools the counselors take the lead,while in other schools teachers do. The ID card was slated to be issued to parents at a meeting in December, 1998. Not many parents come to meetings, so letters about this new card were prepared in English and Spanish.In some cases, home-school liaison workers delivered the ID card in person. In other cases, theywere mailed. E-mail communication between teachers promises applications in instruction as well as information exchange. Migrant students from Yuma are assigned journals to work on whilemigrating and family projects such as describing new locales and their experiences. Theseassignments can be used to obtain better grades in some classes, including classes at thereceiving site. Students who write journals on the computer can send them via the Internet toteachers in Salinas. Many California schools do not have computers, so the work is sent toteachers' home e-mail addresses when teachers so agree. \u0093E-mail journals\u0094 can start electroniccommunication with other teachers. Anticipated outcomes of the electronic information exchange include easier student transition with appropriate placement; improved information for teachers about newly arrivingA-66migrant students; and instructional continuity because students will be able to communicate with the other site. The e-mail transfer will have a direct impact on placement in language assistanceprograms. Teachers will know whether LEP Alisal students arriving in Yuma should be placedin ESL sites or at Pecan Grove, which has inaugurated a two-way bilingual program. Andstudents will be able to scan their work and send it to readers at the other site. These are tangibleexamples of ways to overcome the academic and social disengagement that Rumberger andLarson (1998) said results in mobile students\u0092 dropping out. The e-mail communication has several possibilities. For example, the migrant counselor at Pecan Grove used the term \u0093attachment disorder\u0094 in describing an emotional state migrantstudents suffer when they leave friends and familiar surroundings behind. That term stronglyechoes the \u0093social disengagement\u0094 identified by Rumberger and Larson. She sees the potentialof an \u0093electronic pen-pal\u0094 arrangement through the technology. At 9th grade, e-mail communication between the districts would offer a greater opportunity of credit continuity. It would help erase ambiguity about content of cognate courses.The system has also major implications for academic counseling. Obstacles to Implementation . At intake, staff largely rely on students or their parents to provide the information that they came from Alisal (or any other given district.) Parents havegotten better at notifying schools that they are leaving, but it is continues to be a problem. There are some legal issues that affect the information that can be sent. At the time this study concluded, a decision still needed to be made about the level at which the actual templateinformation will be shared: school or teacher. The school level would affect placements, such asgrade level and language program, and the teacher level would be more detailed and encompassdecisions about instruction. The problem with the e-mail information exchange was related to hardware: Alisal does not have the same degree of hardware capabilities as Yuma. Every teacher in Yuma is on line;this is not the case in Alisal. Promising Practices in Alisal USD To provide instructional continuity to students, migrant staff at Alisal USD are careful to enroll students from Yuma SD#1 into the sheltered English strand of LEP instruction as itA-67closely reflects Yuma\u0092s curriculum. However, newly assigned resource teachers may not be aware of this practice, and some Yuma students may be misplaced into bilingual classes. Yuma is moving toward more sheltered English instruction as opposed to mainstream with some ESL support; this will bring the two districts' methods of serving LEP migrantstudents into closer alignment. Meetings between staff of the two districts have determinedequivalencies among the Bilingual Syntax Measure, ADEPT and IDEA Language ProficiencyTest to allow language proficiency information to be mutually understood and communicated. Obstacles to Coordination . More formal, complete, and timely exchange of migrant student information is hampered by the lack of direct access to relevant technology. Migrantstudent information for Alisal USD is housed at the county office and cannot be accesseddirectly by Alisal's migrant staff; it must be requested by telephone or fax. The lack of acomputerized migrant student database in Alisal makes it difficult to retrieve student informationthat could be used to assess effectiveness, such as language proficiency and/or academicachievement scores. This kind of information must be retrieved by looking through studentfolders by hand. Essential student information is kept on the main district database, but staffreported difficulties getting access to the data. Therefore, the migrant program personnelperceive a need for a separate migrant student database. However, the Alisal USD does not havethe technological requirements, such as computers, nor does it have direct access to the COEinformation kept at the county office. Individual teachers do have computers, so theteacher-to-teacher e -mail exchange is feasible, and was planned for piloting during the 1998-99 school year. The county office has agreed to provide the district one IBM computer; however,one per building would be needed to allow the e-mail system to relay information or informationrequests from the school to the district to the county. Discussion The ID card solution was devised in the series of meetings held between the districts since 1992. As described above, the meetings identified different practices in languageassessment and language support programs. They led to agreement on the kinds of informationteachers needed to facilitate students' entry into the new school and classroom. When the studentidentification card is fully implemented it will help avoid duplication of a myriad of services,such as dental screening and testing. Staff at the receiving school will know what kinds ofsupport services the student has received, such as extended day tutoring. Knowing levels ofacademic performance will also tell the receiving staff how to gear services.A-68Interstate coordination between Yuma and Alisal has come about because of the perseverance of individuals at each end. Both districts have modified local instructional orscheduling practices to enhance continuity and achieve a degree of congruence. They haveidentified needed student information and set in process a means of sharing that informationelectronically. The migrant students shared by Yuma and Alisal face a set of problems commonly encountered by migrant students everywhere: \u0095 Instructional time lost during the move and search for housing and employment; \u0095 Lack of information to help inform instruction at the classroom level; \u0095 Dissimilarities between the language assistance programs for LEP migrant students. In Yuma, solutions to the first problem of lost instructional time consist primarily of tutorial assistance by migrant aides in regular classrooms and use of Migrant Education funds tohelp migrant students attend summer school. Alisal has devised several local solutions to theproblem of lost instructional time, such as intersession study packets, summer school,after-school tutorials and Saturday classes. Solutions to the problems of lack of information and dissimilarities between language assistance programs required strong coordination between Yuma SD1 and Alisal School District.Coordination between the districts has been initiated and sustained primarily at the level of thespecial programs offices, including Migrant Education. At times it has included otheradministrators, specialists, and some teachers. To date, coordination of services for migrantstudents has occurred in the form of unilateral modification of local instructional practices.Specifically, Alisal USD has expanded its English instructional component and placed studentswho spend part of the school year in Yuma in its sheltered English strand. Yuma has endeavoredto strengthen its services to LEP students. It does not have the resources to offer bilingualinstruction, but it is moving toward a model similar to Alisal USD's sheltered English program. The steps taken in Yuma and Alisal to create a common body of shared student information reflect effort expended toward coordination. Without giving up their local languageA-69assessment practices, both districts have coordinated their practices to achieve mutual understanding of student test scores to guide their placement in language assistance programs.The student ID card and e-mail system may lead to greater mutual understanding of studentneeds and thus to more consistent instruction. In this way, these efforts may promote greatercurricular and methodological congruence, thereby lessening educational discontinuity formigrant students. The Yuma-Alisal case may offer special lessons to trading partners who share substantial numbers of identifiable, individual students who regularly travel back and forth between twodistricts. It shows how direct communication between two districts can lead to the identificationand resolution of mutual problems with sustained communication, the commitment of some localresources, and the willingness to change local practices. The fact that these two districts shareonly elementary students simplified the situation. The list of needed information did not includethe complexities of graduation requirements and partial credits that posed such challenges in theother cases. Nevertheless, timely information access and understanding of each other'sinstructional practices were critical to lessening the effects of educational discontinuity. The principal coordination strategy, the e-mail information exchange, holds promise for applications at the district, school, and classroom level. At the district level, the consistentinformation the ID cards and e-mail templates provide may allow better planning because it canfocus on large numbers of students from a single sender. This case showed how identifyinglarge numbers of shared students resulted in modified curriculum practices in both districts. Atthe school level, the information allows more timely, accurate classroom and programplacement. At the teacher level, the information allows within-class placement and instructionthat meets individual needs. As the discussion noted, the system may allow students to buildmore stable connections and overcome feelings of isolation by allowing them to remain incontact with teachers and friends. All of these potential benefits accrued from the identificationof a shared problem and the commitment of time and personal attention toward its resolution.A-70COORDINATING MECHANISMS: \u0093THE REST OF THE STORY\u0094 The trading partners study found several coordinating mechanisms (which included both special resources and educational innovations) that had been put in place on the part of stateoffices of migrant education or in collaborative consortia among state directors and otherinterested persons. These mechanisms repeatedly appeared as important elements forcoordination and continuity of migrant educational services. They provided a type ofmetaphorical glue or cement that allowed local projects to align local programs with thestudents\u0092 home bases, particularly in the case of districts that received students from Texas.Also, they provided the means for districts to gain access to the information needed to makeappropriate placements, calculate partial credits, and ensure that local coursework was posted tothe students\u0092 records in their schools of origin. For these reasons, the mechanisms merit description in this report. Indeed, without these descriptions, the preceding case studies are not complete. They provide further information onwhat migrant educators have done to collaborate and, through their collaborative efforts, devisecreative solutions to the problems migrant students face. The mechanisms are presented anddiscussed under three categories in which they cluster naturally: 1. Technical Assistance and Support 2. Instructional Technologies 3. Information Technologies Technical Assistance and SupportTexas Migrant Interstate Project (TMIP) The Texas Migrant Interstate Project (TMIP) was established in 1980 to address the needs of both \u0093interstate\u0094 and \u0093intrastate\u0094 migrant students because the State Director of theTexas Migrant Education Program recognized that Texas was sending students to 40 differentstates (the current number is 44 states), and would need to work actively with the receiving statesto improve the continuity of education for migrant students.A-71From its inception, TMIP was intended to increase the graduation rate of migrant students by promoting coordination/cooperation of migrant education programs that provide services tomigrant students. The Texas Migrant Interstate Program focuses most of its efforts onsecondary-level credit accrual; in particular, it provides follow-up on calls that require interventions to ensure students are granted credit for work done in several states. The Texas Migrant Interstate Program is funded by the Texas Education Agency (TEA). The Pharr-San Juan-Alamo School District serves as the Program\u0092s fiscal agent. The TexasMigrant Interstate Program\u0092s office is in Pharr, Texas which is located within Region 1 in thelower Rio Grande Valley, where initially 75 percent (currently 65 percent) of the migrants inTexas lived. Up until a few years ago, Pharr had the largest number of migrant students in thenation and even now enrolls over 5,000. Currently, nearby Weslaco and La Joya enroll largernumbers of migrants. The Texas Migrant Interstate Program began its activities with information dissemination and training about the Migrant Education Program in general and the national Migrant StudentRecord Transfer System (MSRTS). In 1982, TMIP introduced the annual Secondary CreditAccrual Workshop to provide educators with detailed instruction on how to facilitate creditaccrual through a variety of activities involving information exchange, matching course content,and the calculation of partial credits. The annual workshop, now in its 17th year, is convened for one full day of presentations and meetings, followed by several days of fact-finding visits to schools in the Rio Grande.During the workshop, concurrent sessions provide updated information on Texas\u0092s secondaryeducation requirements, on alternative opportunities for students to gain course credits, and onnew uses of technology in information transfer and instruction. For example, Texas is movingfrom the \u0093essential elements\u0094 to the new \u0093essential knowledge and (TEKS). The TexasMigrant Interstate Program\u0092s Director noted that \u0093if the curriculum changes a little bit in Texas,then the upstream states must adjust their programs if the students are going to get credit.\u0094 Another very important feature of the annual workshop are the \u0093verification\u0094 meetings. In these meetings, out-of-state participants meet face-to-face with local school district staff toverify credits immediately and address unresolved difficulties in credit accrual for individualstudents. These meetings not only help to resolve the credit accrual problems, but perhapsequally important, provide an opportunity to create and sustain the personal relationshipsnecessary to solve problems effectively and provide adequate follow-through. In the daysA-72following the workshop, TMIP also schedules several trips for out-of-state participants to schools in the valley. During these field trips, out-of-state participants can see and hear first-hand local school faculty discuss their curricula and programs. The participants can also meetwith individual schools or districts as necessary. Over the last ten years, a core group of participants have come regularly to the workshop to sustain their connections. But the workshop also supports new personnel who need to makethose connections and find out what they need to do to satisfy the requirements of a Texasschool. This is particularly pertinent for new staff, who could expend their own time andstudents\u0092 time on services that will not accrue course credits. An example of the value of this workshop occurred in 1998, a counselor from Maine came to meet with people at a school in Brownsville, Texas because the migrant students (whowere now coming to Maine in the summer) were not enrolling in the Summer program. Thestudents did not enroll because the Brownsville school would not accept the work they had donein the previous Summer program for credit. The counselor from Maine met with the counselor atthe Brownsville school and found out what they needed to do in order to have the students getcredit if they participated in the Summer program. Twenty states participated in the 1998 workshop, and there are 17 states that consistently attend. Participants include local administrators, counselors, and people responsible forawarding credit. In the early years, state Directors of Migrant Education Programs came to theworkshop, but TMIP found out that it was critical to bring in the people who actually workedwith the instructional programming and record systems. Some states now send six or sevenpeople because of the different sites they operate within the state and the opportunity to talk withthe appropriate administrators, principals, and counselors invited from Texas. In addition, TMIPinvites registrars, who with local counselors in each school district to award credits to migrantstudents. Last year, 17 of the 20 regions in Texas sent a representative to the workshop and 50school districts also sent a representative. When TMIP staff talk with prospective participants about the value of attending the annual Secondary Credit Accrual Workshop, they emphasize the value of personal relationships: It is a chance to sit across the table, face-to-face, with the people you are going to be dealing with throughout the year. It's a little expensive, but once you get toknow each other, it works much, much better. You get to know each other byA-73name and you are able to pick up the phone and talk when any issue comes up. (Director, TMIP) All three of the professional staff at TMIP (a Director and two program specialists) are certified counselors in Texas and remain up-to-date on the requirements of every graduation planavailable in Texas. They can provide current, expert advice on the proper courses of action withrespect to credit accrual, grade promotion, and graduation. The most important service provided by TMIP is the \u0093follow-up\u0094 by staff whenever an educator or student calls in for information or help. As one staffer said: During the course of any day, people contact TMIP for assistance. Each call is recorded in on a contact log. As counselors, we then call the person and assistthem with their request or problem and document our work on a response log. Ifa school district up north wants student information, they call us. We get themtogether with the person they need to talk with in the Texas school district. Oncethey start to have the conversation, we can step out and let them work it out. It isalways better to let them deal with each other directly than through a third person.(TMIP Program Specialist) Locating a student\u0092s record, finding the right person to talk to, or being able to make an appropriate referral are a large part of the TMIP staff\u0092s work. In making appropriate referrals,TMIP staff rely on the NGS, the Texas Migrant Education Program Directory, the NationalMigrant Education Program Summer School Directory, a directory listing all schools in the stateof Texas, a Directory of Services for Migrant and Seasonal Farm Workers, and a listing of all theuniversities in Texas and their entrance requirements and scholarship information. Increasingly NGS is becoming the key tool. States who participate with NGS can get usually the information they need almost instantly, on their own. However, if a state is not aNGS member, TMIP queries NGS for them to obtain the required student data. If for somereason the information is not on NGS, TMIP then calls the schools directly to get the informationrequested by the state. Although NGS has demonstrated how it can link schools to current information, at the time of this study only 12 of the 44 states that share students with Texas had adopted the NGS.To help other school and district personnel make direct connections on their own, TMIPA-74disseminates the \u0093program directory\u0094 with the names of contact persons, addresses, and telephone and fax numbers of schools in Texas that are serving migrant children. In cases where local policies present a barrier to credit accrual, the credit accrual work of TMIP has been facilitated by the appointment of a Migrant Services Coordinator. The role of theMigrant Services Coordinator is to advocate for migrant children, coordinate migrant projects atthe district level, and coordinate with other migrant staff and projects (such as TMIP).Whenever TMIP staff (on behalf of an upstream state or another district) have a problem with alocal school policy, they can call on the Coordinator to help TMIP handle what they need to doto award credit. The Texas Migrant Interstate Program also supports other services, such as theTexas Exemplary Recognition Program, the Texas Migrant Student Transfer Packet System, theout-of-state TAAS Testing Program, and Project SMART for curriculum dissemination. In its work with the Texas Exemplary Recognition Program, TMIP selects the top ten students in the state (often they are the valedictorian or salutatorian of their entire class).Candidates must be migrant students who migrated during their high school years and have beenassisted by the MEP. Each year TMIP receives over 250 applicants. Although just the top 10are honored at the annual Texas Migrant Education Conference, all 250 are recognized in a bookthat is published and distributed to school counselors. The book is used to show other studentsthat these students (as role models) can succeed; in this way, success for other migrant studentsbecomes tangible. One student from Progreso migrated to seven states and still was able to bethe salutatorian of her class, indicating that personal effort, supported by coordination initiatives,can be successful. The Texas Migrant Student Transfer Packet System or, as it is often more commonly referred to, the \u0093Texas Red Bag,\u0094 is a relatively new service for TMIP. At first, the \u0093red bag\u0094was a temporary means of transferring student records when the MRSTS was eliminated. It wasan actual red bag issued to migrant families to carry school records with them and had TMIP\u0092stoll-free 800 number on it if questions arose. During its early implementation, migrant educatorsin Texas soon recognized that the MSRTS might have had an unintended consequence:decreasing migrant parents\u0092 awareness of and active involvement in the record transfer process.Texas wanted all migrant parents to be more aware of this need and to take all the records withthem. Therefore, a temporary solution was transformed into a system of educating and assistingparents to be responsible for requesting and bringing their children's academic records with themas they traveled.A-75The general idea for \u0093transfer packets\u0094 is that parents or students will take the pertinent records with them, take out their records and add new records before they leave each schoolattendance area, as they move from state to state. The information contained on a student\u0092srecords is intended to help with enrollment in school immediately upon arrival in the receivingstate, to facilitate proper placement of the student in the right classes, to indicate where thestudent left off in his studies and what is needed for completing course credits, and to providecontact information if follow-up is needed to make credit accrual decisions. Currently the \u0093redbag\u0094 is no longer used as districts provide parents with their own folders or boxes to hold studentrecords. There were two phases in the implementation of the project. In the first phase, all parents were informed that the MSRTS was no longer in operation and that they would need to use thetransfer packet to exchange student information. This information was communicated through avideo and also through trainer-of-trainer workshops for staff with migrant programresponsibilities at all of the Education Service Centers (ESCs). These ESCs then providedinformation to parents in the school districts. In the second phase, TMIP put together a set ofmaterials on the education system to empower parents to know their rights and what they need todo. Staff at TMIP did this because many schools do not access the NGS. Parents are providedthe materials (i.e., Migrant Parent\u0092s Resource Guide to Understanding the Educational System ) during locally scheduled training sessions. Districts have been asked to train all previouslyidentified migrant parents over a multi-year period and then provide training for new parentsonly (this training is already in place within the valley). Data on how many parents have beentrained has been sent to TMIP and is now being entered in NGS. At present, the transfer packet has been in use in most of the states that share students with Texas. Currently, most districts in the valley accept information brought to the school in atransfer packet. Sometimes if the course name differs from the name of a course in that district,the school district may need to call the receiving state to confirm the appropriateness of thegrade/credits accrued. Evaluation data is collected only on the number of parents trained. The out-of-state Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) test is the last new major project for TMIP. The Texas Assessment of Academic Skills measures the statewide curriculumin reading and mathematics at grades 3 through 8 and the exit level; in writing in grades 4, 8, andthe exit level; and in science and social studies at grade 8. Satisfactory performance on theTAAS exit-level tests is prerequisite to a high school diploma. Persons with access to testmaterials must maintain and preserve the security and confidential integrity of the test.A-76In previous years, the TAAS was administered in March, and then in October. This timing meant that migrant students often missed both opportunities to take the TAAS. Ensuringthat migrant students had sufficient opportunities to take the TAAS was important because test-taking experience helps students, particularly when they must pass the TAAS later in order tograduate from high school. Again, under the direction of the State Director of MigrantEducation, TMIP was charged with supporting an out-of-state TAAS testing program to providemigrant students with additional opportunities to take the TAAS and to remove one moreobstacle to graduation. When the TAAS first became a part of Texas state policy, the state did not allow anyone outside the state to administer the test. In the first year (1992), TMIP staff and TAAScoordinators from local school districts visited different states and administered the test. At thetime this study was conducted, a cooperative agreement has been signed by both Texas and anyreceiving state that wishes to administer the TAAS. Training to administer the TAAS isconducted at the National Migrant Education Conference. The training lasts 90 minutes to 2hoursnot a barrier for staff interested in acquiring this skill. Participants also receive copies of the forms, test guidelines, and study guides. Texas Migrant Interstate Program staff provide approval to administer out-of-state TAAS tests through an interstate registration process with Summer migrant programs. States receivingmigrant students prepare lists of students who are interested in taking the TAAS; TMIP thenconfirms that the students are eligible to take the TAAS (via school district or the TexasEducation Agency\u0092s test processing center). If the student is not already on the database (thusconfirming eligibility to take the test), TMIP calls the school district to check on the student\u0092sstatus to take the TAAS for the first time. To be eligible to take the TAAS, students should havecompleted their sophomore year in Texas and completed freshman English and Math. TheTexas Migrant Interstate Program then sends the information and registration list to the local site,which tests on the designated date, returns the test roster to TMIP, and sends the test materialsdirectly to Iowa City, Iowa to be scored. In the first year 159 students were tested, and that number went up to 483. Currently that number is decreasing (238) because staff in Texas are doing a better job, the receiving states aregetting better material to work with, and more students are passing the TAAS the first, second, orthird time.A-77The Texas Migrant Interstate Program has a rich history of suppo rting interstate coordination initiatives. In the early 1980s, TMIP sent \u0093interstaters\u0094 to upstream states to spendthe Summer working as counselors with the students who arrived from Texas. The contactsmade across the states proved helpful; these contacts formed a base for future efforts. The TMIP has also worked too build awareness of the Migrant Education Program among Superintendents of Schools. This activity is supported annual by the Educational ServiceCenter I. The Executive Director of Region I believed that unless the superintendent becomescommitted to the success of the Migrant Education Program, the coordination among districtswould not be supported at a level needed for staff to succeed. She has invited the 38superintendents in the valley to visit at least once one of the states that receive the largest numberof migrant students (i.e., Washington, Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio). The TMIP staff is the core of its service delivery capabilities. They build relationships with both Texas school faculty and out-of-state migrant educators or district personnel. TMIPstaff work with district and school personnel on a daily basis to work out the difficulties inhelping migrant children to accrue credits, have grades consolidated, take the TAAS, and involveand empower parents all efforts geared to help migrant students graduate from high school. Summary of Texas Migrant Interstate Program (TMIP) Services . As described above, the TMIP offers comprehensive services to assist in the coordination of educational services formigrant students nationwide. Key services include: \u0095 Conducting training about secondary credit accrual and graduation issues at national conferences, state conferences, and out-of-state conferences. \u0095 Helping build relationships between educators in different districts and states via its conferences and telephone conference calls. \u0095 Providing general advice to states about what students need to accomplish to graduate in Texas (especially the new graduation requirements and Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills). \u0095 Working with school counselors to confirm what courses are needed by individual Texas students. \u0095 Interpreting out-of-district student information for Texas districts. \u0095 Supporting credit accrual via the \u0093transfer packet.\u0094A-78\u0095 Using NGS as a tool to check on student information. \u0095 Using mail/fax of documents to support credit accrual. \u0095 Overseeing the out-of-state TAAS testing program. \u0095 Disseminating contact materials (i.e., site directories) \u0095 Promoting migrant student graduation through the Exemplary Migrant Student Project. \u0095 Disseminating Project SMART Materials. \u0095 Disseminating informational videos (e.g., the migrant experience). \u0095 Conducting the parent training on the education system for some of the Education Service Centers. Florida Migrant Interstate Project The Florida Migrant Interstate Project (FMIP) is headquartered in Immokalee, Florida. It was initiated in 1992 and is funded through the Florida Department of Education as a resourcecenter that coordinates activities for states and districts that send or receive Florida migrantstudents. The FMIP is the information hub for migrant education in Florida and maintains apaper file system of all migrant kids in the state. The FMIP's objectives are to: \u0095 Increase the number and percent of Florida migrant students identified in Florida and in receiving states; \u0095 Facilitate curriculum-matching between states; \u0095 Serve as a resource center to the Florida Department of Education on inter -state coordination issues; \u0095 Empower migrant parents to get them more involved in their children's school success. Services provided by FMIP to meet these objectives include:A-79\u0095 Sharing education and health information with receiving states on Florida migrant students through the FMIP Newsletter, interstate meetings, and telephone/fax contacts; \u0095 Conducting follow-up on interstate identification and recruitment issues; \u0095 Providing training and technical assistance at local, state, regional, and national workshops; \u0095 Assisting receiving states make direct contact with Florida home-base schools through the Florida Schools Directory and telephone/fax contacts; \u0095 Coordinating curriculum-matching between states; \u0095 Empowering parents to play a more active role in their children\u0092s education through information provided on two toll free telephone lines. The annual Directory of Florida Contacts for Florida Home-based Migrant Students (the \u0093Directory\u0094) is FMIP\u0092s cornerstone resource for both Florida districts and the receiving states.District staff use school contact information in the Directory to connect with a sending orreceiving district. If necessary, districts can call FMIP on one of its 800 numbers for assistance.The FMIP will make the appropriate contacts directly and try to resolve the information request.Calls are evenly divided between requests for individual student information and for informationon educational programs for migrant students. About two-thirds of the calls come fromreceiving districts in other states. Along with the Directory, the phone and the fax are theprimary vehicles used by FMIP for sharing information. A print vehicle for disseminatinginformation, the FMIP Newsletter, goes to all FMIP contacts throughout the nation, primarily toMichigan, Texas, and Florida. The bilingual teacher exchange is an example of curriculum-matching and came about because of a request from Pennsylvania for help in placing bilingual teachers to work withSpanish-speaking migrant students in that state's Summer programs. The exchange expanded toinclude eight states. In summer 1998, FMIP sent 12 bilingual teachers to the eight states,including three to Pennsylvania. Language assistance now includes Haitian Creole along withSpanish. The FMIP pays for the teachers' round-trip air transportation, hotel lodging, and carrental for the four to six weeks of the Summer program. The receiving state pays the teachers'Summer salary.A-80The FMIP has maintained a close connection with ESCORT (originally the Eastern Stream Center on Resources and Training), which provides material resources to the FMIPthrough from headquarters in Oneonta, New York. ESCORT staff provide additional technicalassistance to FMIP through its subcontract with the Comprehensive Center in Tampa operated byETS. ESCORT also provides financial help to FMIP by funding its toll free 800 phone numberparent hotlines. ESCORT has an informal relationship with FMIP; there is no formal plan orbudgeted cooperative activity. Staff from both offices communicate weekly, and ESCORT staffrepresent Florida migrant education and FMIP at interstate conferences. They do this primarilyby presenting \u0093Florida 101\u0094 at in-service conferences. This consists of an overview of theservices FMIP offers to migrant students and educators; use of the Florida Schools Directory;awareness of the Florida State Assessment and its test administration dates; Florida graduationrequirements; and information on migrant advocacy. Like the Texas Interstate Migrant Project, FMIP sponsors an annual interstate meeting that is broader in focus than that offered by TMIP. The FMIP maintains a K-12 focus, whereasTexas targets secondary credit accrual. The FMIP brings in the staff of receiver states operatingSummer programs (principals, guidance counselors, teachers) so that they can meet with theirFlorida counterparts and become familiar with the sending districts. Typically, 200 people attend the meeting, representing 15-17 states. The first day features a keynote speaker and breakout sessions in which attendees discuss interstate issues andconcerns in migrant education such as block scheduling. The conference also highlights exhibitbooths from the Florida districts where staff from receiving states can visit and become familiarwith the originating districts. On the second and third days of the conference, staff fromreceiving states visit those Florida school districts who share migrant students with them. This isan opportunity to network, plan programs, and develop personal relationships among staff of theoriginating and receiving districts. Instructional Technologies Project SMART Project SMART (Summer Migrants Access Resources through Technology) is a national distance learning instructional program that is broadcast via satellite from ESC-20 in SanAntonio, for eight weeks over the Summer. This broadcast is targeted to Texas migrant studentswho live temporarily in other participating states around the country. Project SMART isA-81intended to help migrant students earn credits needed for high school graduation. The TMIP disseminates Project SMART materials; it also conducts workshops and presentations onSMART. Project SMART can be implemented in various ways, including site-based andhome-based models. In the \u0093site-based model,\u0094 exemplified in this study in Sidney, Montana, students participate interactively in a classroom setting with the SMART television and their local\u0093SMART Partner\u0094 teachers who prepare the students for the instructional broadcast, facilitateinteractions by telephone with the SMART television teacher, and conduct follow-up instructionand assessment. Alternatively, students can view the live instruction later on videotape or view apreviously taped lesson. Only high school courses are offered for credit. One high school courseis taught each Summer on a revolving basis. The videotapes offer students the opportunity toview the current course at a later time if they cannot attend class, or they can view a previouslybroadcast course if that fits their course accrual needs better. The home-based SMART model is implemented for migrant students who remain over the summer in Texas. Migrant home visitors function as \u0093SMART Partners\u0094 in this model.Expected outcome indicators for SMART include accrual of high school credits, gradepromotion, and high school graduation. The Educational Service Center-20 is the instructional delivery and support center for the Project SMART. Project SMART is funded by the Texas Education Agency through the statelegislature using the Pharr-San Juan-Alamo ISD (PSJA) as its fiscal agent. The ESC-20broadcasts SMART to 42 states, including Texas. More broadly, ESC-20 is a private non-profitorganization with a separate board of directors and a distance learning focus. It operates the StarSchools consortium, for example, in conjunction with the State Education Agencies from Texas,Illinois, and North Carolina. The ECS-20 became involved with distance learning in 1985 by developing the capability to deliver curricula to small schools in Texas who otherwise could not meet the added creditdemands placed on them from curriculum restructuring in Texas at that time. The ESC-20 hadthe requisite distance learning infrastructure in place when first approached by the state migrantdirector to develop a distance learning curriculum for migrant education. The ECS-20 thensubmitted a proposal that the Texas Education Agency funded as a pilot project with Montana.A-82In 1993, a national advisory committee of migrant directors and practitioners recommended expanding Project SMART beyond the pilot phase. The Public BroadcastingService (PBS) then picked up the broadcasts for national showing. With expanded funding,ESC-20 set about developing the SMART curriculum and its instructional delivery at the SanAntonio site. The Summer broadcasts are designed to encourage secondary-level credit accrualin Texas and to offer Texas-based students with culturally relevant instruction while they are inanother state over the Summer. Project SMART is also broadcast in Texas over the Summer as asupplemental home instruction program. The ESC-20 controls the development and delivery of the SMART broadcasts but is not responsible for the selection and implementation of specific SMART models. It is important forlocal site staff to know how to match appropriate SMART models to the needs of the migrantstudents. One of the problems ESC-20 faces is the need to deliver onsite training on demand,including consultations on the models. Project SMART began as a pilot project between Montana and Texas, but by 1998 it had grown to serve approximately 35,000 migrant students in 17 states. The operating cost per site isabout $2,000 for the satellite dish, curriculum, and related materials. PROJECT ESTRELLA As described earlier in this volume, Project ESTRELLA supports interstate coordination through the use of laptop computers. It is one of six technology projects funded by the Office ofMigrant Education and works with the Migrant Education Programs of Montana, Illinois, NewYork, and Texas, all of which offer evening programs in the Summer with instructional staff andcomponents. Participating local sites in Texas are Pharr-San Juan-Alamo (PSJA), Weslaco, LaJolla, and Eagle Pass. Project ESTRELLA provides the core curriculum and support systems to enhance the services offered through NovaNET. It relies on the participating states\u0092 direct instructionalsupport through certified teachers. Summer programs make a commitment to find instructionalpersonnel with appropriate areas of expertise to support the NovaNET courses. Project ESTRELLA selects high school migrant students based on nominations from their school sites and the Summer sites in receiving states. Students are selected on the basis ofA-83demonstrated dependability and likelihood of success, although they are not necessarily the most academically talented. Students are allowed to work on only one NovaNET course at a time. This policy is intended to encourage completion of courses attempted, by removing the possibility of taking ontoo much and not completing the work. ESTRELLA works with counselors at the students\u0092 high schools to determine which courses to offer. Priority is given to courses where the students have partial credit, to allow themto complete those courses. Priority is also given to courses students have failed in previousattempts, or where credit was not given for any reasons. They try to keep the students on trackfor graduation. The project intended to give priority to juniors and seniors, but currently, mostparticipants are freshmen and sophomores. The project intends to work closely with seniors forpost-secondary enrollment, for example, helping them with application information and writingthe college entrance essay. The ESTRELLA Interstate Student Coordinator works with school counselors to recruit student participants, trouble-shoots technical problems, and monitors student participation. TheCoordinator monitors students' time on-line along with their coursework progress using datacollected by the system. The Interstate Student Coordinator also works with counselors to ensurethat credit is posted to transcripts. He continues to work with students even after they havereturned to their home schools in Texas to monitor their progress and see if they still need towork on the Nova Net curriculum. Each State uses ESTRELLA differently. New York's program operates through BOCES, and the state agencies are the partners in Montana and Texas. New York and Montana havecontracts with Illinois. Texas does not have a contract but contributes in-kind support. Contractsspecify that the states have primary responsibility for implementation within their jurisdictions.The contracts also specify unique partner responsibilities. BOCES oversees the cybermentorscomponent, and Montana is responsible for professional development. The Texas EducationAgency assists in liaison with the Texas districts. For the cybermentors component, the Project ESTRELLA contracts with the University of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio, which has a service learning orientation and a specialinterest in minority students. Students at the university volunteer time as mentors forparticipating high school students. They maintain communication via e-mail and serve as roleA-84models, letting the high school students know that college is possible for them. They provide information on college life and the campus experience, such as assistance with applicationprocesses and applications for financial aid. Many migrant students\u0092 families have no experiencewith college, so this personal contact is important for them. Project ESTRELLA supports aprogram assistant at the university to disseminate information, recruit mentors, and providemonthly training for the mentors. The mentors have 24-hour computer lab access with e-mail provided through the university's system. Some of the mentors have laptops loaned through another migrant program.The high school students have e-mail through NovaNET. Project ESTRELLA also includes a Visual Learning component, through the Polaroid Education Program. It emphasizes student writing and incorporation of visual images in writing.Student writing is published in Project ESTRELLA\u0092s newsletter; a recent issue featured threearticles about recent floods in Eagle Pass, where some of the students live. The articles includedpoetry and photographs. Project ESTRELLA also focuses on parents and attempts to involve them in their children\u0092s education. The Interstate Student Coordinator has taken the lead on this component.When migrant students express interest in Project ESTRELLA, parents are required to attend anorientation before their children will be considered for the project. At the orientation, theproject\u0092s benefits are explained to parents, as well as their own responsibilities, such as providingenough time to their children to be on line. After students are accepted to participate in the project, training is provided and laptops are distributed. Parents must sign a contract to notify the project of any problems; they must filea police report if the laptop is stolen. As part of the training, parents and other family memberslearn how to use the laptops. Ease with laptops is encouraged by the project so family memberscan model for younger children in the family. However, parents\u0092 main responsibility is toprovide a home environment conducive to learning. The project currently works with Global School Net on professional development and intends to submit a plan to the U.S. Office of Migrant Education. This component would bringpeople from upstream states for hands-on experience with the laptops and Office 97, to showthem how to integrate the technology with their own teaching. It also will address methods ofA-85working collaboratively among schools and with students. The training will be followed by on-line workshops and by presentations at selected state Migrant Education Conferences. University of Texas (UT) Migrant Student Program The University of Texas (UT) Migrant Student Program is an independent study option for students who have fallen behind in their schoolwork because of illness, work, or familymoves; these students need a flexible way to earn high school credits. The UT Program allowsstudents to study independently using an assigned study guide and text. An accredited UTteacher grades the completed lessons by mail and sends the student individualized writtenfeedback on their lesson performance. The UT teacher is also available to the student through atollfree 800 number for telephone conferences. The UT Program is funded by the TexasEducation Agency (TEA) and offers 22 semester-length high school print-based courses and twocomputer-based courses (using IBMs, MacIntoshes, or laptops) in English language arts,mathematics, social studies, science, health, home economics, and Spanish. University of TexasProgram courses are approved for credit by the Texas Education Agency and count toward Texasgraduation requirements. Print-based and computer-based courses are also offered by UT inmath and language arts to prepare students for the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills(TAAS). Six models are available for implementing the UT Migrant Student Program. Theyinclude: \u0095 Partial Work \u0095 Teleconferencing For example, the correspondence model is typically combined with on-site grading by interstate migrant students. Texas-based migrant students who spent the summer of 1998 inSidney, Montana, and needed credit-bearing English literature courses, enrolled in a Universityof Texas correspondence course which integrated the study of authentic literature with reading,writing, and communication skills. The Sidney teachers supervised and graded the students\u0092 UTEnglish literature coursework over the summer. When these students traveled to other states formigrant work with their families in the Fall, the UT teachers took over the instructionalsupervision and grading. Outside of Texas in 1997, the UT correspondence model was used byA-86145 Texas-based migrant students in 8 states (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Montana, Michigan, Indiana, North Dakota, Ohio, and New York). Within Texas, the credit-by-exam and partialwork models are most frequently used. In Eagle Pass, Texas, for example, migrant students canmake up incomplete course work using the partial work approach. Alternatively, migrantstudents can earn high school course credits by passing a proficiency exam covering theappropriate essential knowledge and skills. Portable Assisted Study Sequence (PASS). The Portable Assisted Study Sequence (PASS) Program was developed in California in the late 1970s as an approach to secondary school dropout prevention. It has since beennationally recognized as an exemplary program by the U.S. Department of Education andadopted by over 30 states. Florida began implementing PASS in 1993 after determining that PASS courses met Florida Public Education curriculum requirements. Florida\u0092s PASS Program offers 32 credit-bearing courses in art, health, language arts, life skills, mathematics, science, and social studies.These semester-length courses consist of five units of study; students must pass all five unit teststo get credit for the course. The PASS is a collection of semi-independent public educationcourses for students in grades 9-12. The program allows students to participate in high schoolclasses and accumulate credits toward graduation through home-study or as they travel with theirfamily for employment-related reasons. In Florida, the dominant PASS model involves home-study for intra-state migrant students whose families tend to pull them out of school during the academic year for agriculturalor fishing work with the family. This work takes place either in the local school district orinvolves a temporary move to another county in Florida. Florida\u0092s interstate migrant populationis much smaller than its intra-state population. The PASS Program serves the needs of suchstudents because it is a self-contained, portable curriculum. Migrant students can take PASScourse materials with them, either as independent study at home or as a correspondence courseon the road. A PASS Facilitating Teacher in either the home school district or in the receiver school district will meet with the migrant student on a weekly basis to monitor progress and to assess the student at appropriate intervals with a unit test. The Facilitating Teacher then sendsthe unit tests to the Florida PASS office to be scored. Once a course has been successfullycompleted, a Grade Report is sent by fax from the Florida PASS office to the national PASSoffice in California requesting credit for the course. Based on an interstate agreement betweenA-87Florida and California, PASS credits are awarded by Roosevelt High School in California and accepted by the student\u0092s home-base school in Florida. After receiving the transcript fromCalifornia PASS, Florida PASS makes a copy for its files and the original to the appropriatedistrict contact person to record. Florida and Michigan began coordinating their PASS Programs in 1998 through a partnership between the Manatee County, Florida, and the Van Buren County, Michigan, publicschools. The Florida PASS Program attempted to enroll Florida home-based migrant students inPASS prior to their departure for Michigan so the students could continue their Floridacoursework while working with their families out-of-state. This partnership succeeded withseveral Manatee County students who continued to use Florida PASS materials while in VanBuren County over the summer of 1998. Information Technologies New Generation System The New Generation System (NGS) was designed by a consortium of state migrant education programs in response to the unavailability of migrant student data following thediscontinuation of MSRTS. Staff members from the consortium states are trained as trainers atthe national conference to provide consortium states with in-state NGS coordination andexpertise. The New Generation System is centralized and contains 400,000 records. All the dataare resident in the server located in Austin, Texas. The system was designed as a central system(versus distributed system) to facilitate efficiency in system maintenance. All of the data areencrypted (32 bit key) for security purposes; sites are given access passwords. Because thesystem is centralized and Internet-based, NGS does not have to upload new versions to the siteusers. To access the system, all a user needs is a browser and a connection to the Internet. This database consists of student records and does not yet contain \u0093family\u0094 records. The system requires that each student have a unique identification number. The search system and\u0093key\u0094 data items used to identify student records are not yet as sophisticated as the MSRTS.Because of the system\u0092s design, any change a user makes is available instantly to any other user. Critical education data maintained on NGS includes:\u0095 Secondary-level credits earned by the studentA-88\u0095 Grade placement (and comments from staff) \u0095 Immunization records \u0095 Migrant contact information \u0095 Required course of study (secondary-level) \u0095 Type of course schedule (block, traditional, etc.) \u0095 Medical alerts. At any one time, 60-80 people may be on-line out of the current 1,000 users. There are two different levels of access. One is \u0093read and write\u0094 only; this status precludes deletingrecords. The other is simply \u0093read\u0094 (the same provisions against deleting records apply).Inactive records are archived. Users are able to print individual records or portions of a record.Full reports are sent by e-mail to users upon request. The \u0093home-page\u0094 of NGS provides userswith updates on the system and other relevant notices (e.g.., scheduled system shutdowns). Major changes to the system are approved by the national and Texas advisory boards. Each of the other NGS member states is encouraged to have its own advisory board.Programmers hold final approval rights as well as the authority to set priorities (in case ofexcessive costs or complications). For example, a recently requested enhancement to the systemincluded the ability to complete \u0093mass\u0094 (batch) transactions. Although consortium states cannot download NGS information directly to create a local database, files can be created for state use upon request. Staff in Texas\u0092s ESC-1 providetechnical assistance and support to users, although the growing system needs and user demandfor these services already may have exceeded current staff and resources. If NGS expandsbeyond its current membership, the support of a more robust technical support capability will bea pressing issue. The system costs each state approximately $2.72 per student per year. To make NGS work better, more states need to be involved in the system. Currently, all the data on students is not complete because enrollments and withdrawals in non-member statesare not entered on the system. Texas only enters the last qualifying move. And because many ofthe states are reluctant to give up the systems they have developed, further cooperation toimprove the system remains problematic. "}
