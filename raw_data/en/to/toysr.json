Taxes where applicable. Publisher's summary Energy medicine. Acupuncture. Superfoods. Healing magnets. What does the scientific evidence really say about these and other \"alternative medicine\" treatments for personal wellness? How can we know if a natural remedy is safe and effective? How can people become their own best skeptical consumer of health news in the media? Join neurologist and science educator Dr. Steven Novella for a fascinating exploration of these and other important questions about the truths\u2014and myths\u2014behind alternative medicine. Perhaps the most important skill to have in this brave new world of ever-changing medical news is the ability to evaluate sources and information, and to think critically about how alternative medicine is marketed, regulated, and used. Dr. Novella takes a rigorous, science-based approach in exploring so-called \"popular\" and \"cutting-edge\" trends. Armed with this knowledge, listeners will be in a much better position to assess alternative pathways to physical health. Dr. Novella's 10 leading-edge lectures will answer such questions as: - Do magnetic fields really have useful biological properties? - Why is chiropractic treatment no more effective for pain management than simple physical therapy? - Can brain games truly make one smarter or help in staving off dementia? - Can homeopathic remedies, such as those derived from plants and minerals, really cure ailments? - Does cupping therapy really help to reduce pain and inflammation, while increasing blood flow? Dr. Novella provides insights on the ever-widening gap between alternative medicine and scientific medicine, giving listeners the confidence they need to become their own best health advocates.

As the thyroid has gotten more and more attention, though, these symptoms haven't gone away - people aren't healing. - - Should be called ALL about Epstein-Barr Virus EBV - By djjaxs on 08-07-18 By: [Anthony William](/author/Anthony-William/B01062IX0K?ref=a_pd_The-Sk_c5_adblp13npsbx_3_6_1&pf_rd_p=fc97593f-ccc9-4b20-ba92-ec3b392e5863&pf_rd_r=E8CF2AS5Y637SWJVZDWJ&pageLoadId=g1m7zFsfNMIWH01Z&creativeId=1dfe4386-f6dc-4021-b08a-483cfe6b0bb1) Our favorite moments from The Skeptic's Guide to Alternative Medicine - Chapter Three - Lecture Two - - Chapter Five - Lecture Four - - Chapter Eight - Lecture Seven - - Chapter Three - Lecture Two - Herbs and Supplements - Chapter Five - Lecture Four - Healing Magnets - Chapter Eight - Lecture Seven - Chiropractic Treatment Publisher's summary Energy medicine. Acupuncture. Superfoods. Healing magnets. What does the scientific evidence really say about these and other \"alternative medicine\" treatments for personal wellness? How can we know if a natural remedy is safe and effective? How can people become their own best skeptical consumer of health news in the media? Join neurologist and science educator Dr. Steven Novella for a fascinating exploration of these and other important questions about the truths\u2014and myths\u2014behind alternative medicine. Perhaps the most important skill to have in this brave new world of ever-changing medical news is the ability to evaluate sources and information, and to think critically about how alternative medicine is marketed, regulated, and used. Dr. Novella takes a rigorous, science-based approach in exploring so-called \"popular\" and \"cutting-edge\" trends. Armed with this knowledge, listeners will be in a much better position to assess alternative pathways to physical health. Dr. Novella's 10 leading-edge lectures will answer such questions as: - Do magnetic fields really have useful biological properties? - Why is chiropractic treatment no more effective for pain management than simple physical therapy? - Can brain games truly make one smarter or help in staving off dementia? - Can homeopathic remedies, such as those derived from plants and minerals, really cure ailments? - Does cupping therapy really help to reduce pain and inflammation, while increasing blood flow? Dr. Novella provides insights on the ever-widening gap between alternative medicine and scientific medicine, giving listeners the confidence they need to become their own best health advocates.

Dr. Novella provides a deep dive into alternative medicine as understood from the western medicine paradigm. Unfortunately he does little to distinguish between studies he is citing and his own opinion. He makes wonderful observations on herbal remedies and the need for them to be more closely regulated, and has interesting perspectives on medical devices and homeopathy. Once he reached energy medicine, however, it became clear he was talking (at least on this topic) as an outsider looking in, likely with the most introductory understanding of the topic he was critiquing. Of course that's fine, and be honest about your exposure and knowledge of the topic before explaining it or casting your perspective on it. Why do I say he lacked deeper understanding? First his explanation of \"Qi\" was inaccurate and reductive. Many westerns confuse with as energy, based off of poor early translations of Chinese to English. However he goes further to translate it to men's blood, which is wildly inaccurate. He then has to go into explaining the mechanics of energy medicine not on the merit or theory they're based on, but rather through a strange straw man argument dealing with a metaphorical child and their favorite toy. I'll admit it made me laugh, both with him and at what he was saying. I'll continue to update this review as I carry on. This is by no means a suggestion to skip this course. It is very interesting. Instead, maybe think of this as a lecture to spring board a deeper dive into the wider would of holistic medicine.

He notes that many such treatments are untested by properly conducted experiment, and replication. He notes many alleged medical treatments and cures either fail clinical tests or are not tested at all. The public is forearmed by Novella's critique of alternative medicine. Be skeptical about what your friend, an acquaintance, a mother, a sister, a brother suggests is a remedy for your malady. Be particularly skeptical of an industry unsupervised by the FDA. Everyone should be wary of unqualified medical treatment, prescribed medicines, vitamins, and herbs. Companies in the field of alternative medicine are not in the business for your health. They are in the business of making money. It seems prudent to suggest one should reserve a measure of skepticism for all purveyors of cures, even medical professionals. As is true of all humans, medical professionals can be seduced by the desire for money, power, and prestige--even at the expense of those who seek care. 10 people found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - [Steve](/listener/amzn1.account.AFTSUABEQUJKYEND7CWZG3WHADOQ?ref=a_pd_The-Sk_c15_rvlsnl_2&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=E8CF2AS5Y637SWJVZDWJ&pageLoadId=g1m7zFsfNMIWH01Z&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 03-08-20 Skeptics Guide to Whatever...

Maybe he should have kept his views on chiropractic to the US profession.

Should be called A Biased Medical Doctor's Guide to Alterative Medicine, as author/narrator more than skeptical. This is should be in comedy section as laughable at how the author/narrator having a MD title is so anti to anything that is not western, medical university trained and clinical science in hospital setting or as they call it in US 'Board Certified'. Only I know this is set in modern times the author/narrator seems to be stuck in the middle ages! It is ironic really as all the pitfalls and criticism he talks of in chapter one towards badly published and biased science research and study is exactly how he goes about justifying his biased approach and name calling as he finds all he can to justify his 'research' and 'reading'! Practical calls all types of alternative/complimentary therapies as scams, trickery, frauds, quakes and uses all the old terms which he seems to love as constant use of the term snake oil peddlars. I wonder if he is sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry as he is pro pills and surgery as 'cure' for all health issues. Not one form of alternative medicine (says it all in use of term instead of complimentary therapy) does he support or accept as helpful to anyone. Everything outside of mainstream medicine is pseudoscience, hocus pocus, scams, frauds and then has the longest neck ever to promote his own speciality and developing therapy in neuroscience. Truly laugh out loud! Obviously like all reviews, this is my own personal opinion and I declare fact that I work in complimentary therapy field. So although I like to think of myself as open-minded and happily listen to fact based and all sides of the coin this one is so staunchly biased and not a neutral bone or cell can be found in the recording. 1 person found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - Anonymous User - 11-22-21 Missing another perspective Love the lesson but all in all i thinkthat it lacks another perspective.

Claims often undermined by fallacies of structure, ad-hominem, and assertions without evident backing.
