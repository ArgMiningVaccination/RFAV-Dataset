High vaccine costs, however, impede implementation in endemic countries. To test single-dose vaccination as a possible alternative, we initiated an observational, longitudinal study in Nicaragua, to assess protective effectiveness and \u2014through challenge vaccination \u2014humoral immune memory response. Methods .After a 2003 serosurvey, 130 originally seronegative children received one dose of viros omal HAV vaccine in 2005, fol- lowed by yearly serological and clinical assessments until 2012. After 7.5 years, a vacci ne booster was administered. Concurrent antibody screening of patients presenting with hepatitis symptoms documented persistent HAV circulati on in the communities studied. Results .Between serosurvey and vaccination, 25 children contracted hepatitis A subclinically (>80 00 mIU/mL anti-HAV). In the remaining 105 children, immunization resulted in anti-HAV levels of 17 -572 mIU/mL. Based on the 15% annual infection risk, an estimated 60% of children were exposed to HAV encounters during follow-up. No child presen ted with hepatitis symptoms. Serological breakthrough infection (7106 mIU/mL) was documented in 1 child, representing an estimated pr otective effectiveness of 98.3% (95% condence interval, 87.9 -99.8). Boosting elicited an average 29.7-fold increase of anti-HAV levels. Conclusions .In children living in hyperendemic settings, a single dose of virosomal HAV vaccine is suf cient to activate immune memory and may provide long-term protection. Keywords. hepatitis A; single-dose booster interval; immune memory. In many developing countries, hepatitis A represents an in- creasing health issue. An estimated 212 million cases of hepati- t i sAv i r u s( H A V )i n f e c t i o n[ 1], and 33 million cases of symptomatic illness [ 2] occurred worldwide in 2005, with some 35 000 estimated deaths, a substantial increase from the 177 million infections estimated for 1990 [ 1]. In highly endem- ic, resource-poor countries, hepatitis A causes little sympto- matic illness because infections occur mainly in young children, in whom the infection typically remains asymptomatic [1,3]. However, improvement in hygiene and access to cleanwater, as seen in newly industrializing countries, shift the rst HAV contact to older age groups. Because older individuals are prone to more severe disease, this leads to a rise in disease burden [ 1,2,4]. This epidemiological transition to lower endemicity and higher disease burden led some endemic countries to imple- m e n tu n i v e r s a lm a s sv a c c i n a t i o n( U M V )o ft o d d l e r sw i t h2 doses of inactivated HAV vaccine, the rst being Israel in 1999. Israel effectively eliminated hepatitis A within a few years, by targeting young children, the main source of infection, therewith providing herd immunity to older age groups [ 5]. The United States [ 6], China [ 7], and some other industrialized countries [ 8] decided to protect at rst only speci c risk groups (toddlers, older children, and teenagers) in certain regions. After a few years of successful regional vaccination campaigns, the United States [ 6] and China [ 7] extended their strategies to UMV of toddlers in the mid-2000s, as did Panama and Greece [9,10].

For permiss ions, e-mail alin most endemic countries in need [ 1,11,12]. In 2005, as the rst country worldwide, Argentina implemented a single-dose UMV strategy, trusting that protection from 1 dose would last for at least 5 -10 years, enough time to eliminate HAV circulation [ 13]. In the early 2000s, it was shown that a rst HAV vaccine dose can efciently be boosted after 5 -8 years in adult travelers [ 14, 15]. This observation prompted the question of whether a single HAV vaccine dose would suf ce to provide lasting protection in individuals living in endemic regions. Building on a cross- sectional, age-strati ed hepatitis A serosurvey in 2003/2004 among children and adults in Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua [ 16], we initiated a prospective, observational pilot study in HAV-seronegative children in 2005 to assess the effectiveness and the persistence of immune memory after a single dose of a virosomal HAV vaccine [ 17]. METHODS Study Conduct Our study was based on a serosurvey carried out in Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua, in 2003/2004, estimating the annual HAV infection risk, as described elsewhere [ 16]. HAV-seronegative children identied in the serosurvey were invited to participate in this single-dose HAV vaccine long-term follow-up study. The ethics committee of the National Autonomous University Le\u00f3n ap- proved the study. Written informed consent was obtained by the parents of participating children. A standard-of-care hepa- titis A vaccine booster dose was to be offered at the end of the study. A total of 130 children were vaccinated in January 2005 with a single 0.5-mL dose of the virosomal hepatitis A vaccine Epaxal [formerly Berna Biotech]) [ 17], followed by serological and clinical assessments after 3 months and then yearly from 2006 -2010 and in 2012, to document serolog- ical changes and/or clinical signs suggestive of HAV infection. At each yearly visit, parents were asked to report on jaundice or any relevant illness in the previous 12 months. Mid-2012, after an observational period of 7.5 years, a booster dose of an alum-adsorbed hepatitis A vaccine (Havrix Junior or Havrix, de- pending on age; GlaxoSmithKline) was administered as a stan- dard-of-care procedure. Blood samples were collected before and 4 -8 weeks after the booster dose. To document the continuing HAV circulation in the study area, a viral hepatitis diagnosis project was set up in parallel by the Medical Faculty of the University of Le\u00f3n. During 2006 -2010, all patients presenting at the community health centers in Le\u00f3n with jaundice or other hepatitis symptoms were offered free biochemical tests (liver enzyme and bilirubin measurements) and a serological hepatitis A screening (en- zyme-linked immosorbent assay stripe test), later con rmed by a standard anti-HAV immunoglobulin (Ig) M test [ 18].Antibody Testing Serum samples were stored at 20\u00b0C and later shipped to the Institute of Virology, Technical University of Munich, to be tested quantitatively for total anti-HAV antibodies using the mi- croparticle enzyme immunoassay HAVAB 2.0 Quantitative for the AxSYM system (Abbott Diagnostics Division). The lower limit of detection for anti-HAV antibodies was 10 mIU/mL, corresponding to the lowest accepted cutoff for the correlate of protection [ 6]. High-reacting serum samples (>1000 mIU/ were tested for anti-HAV IgM (HAV AB 2.0-M, AxSYM; Abbott). Owing to logistic constraints, the quantitative anti- HAV serology data include the results of 4 testing sessions: 2003 (serosurvey), 2005 -2006 (vaccine response and identi ca- tion of HAV infections), 2006 -2010 (follow-up, all serum samples tested in parallel with the same test kit lot), and 2012 (pre- and postbooster assessment of immune memory). The same expert (G. F.) performed all anti-HAV measurements. Statistical Analysis Frequencies and percentages of categorical variables were com- pared using 2or Fisher exact tests as appropriate. Means, stan- d a r dd e v i a t i o n s ,m e d i a n s ,a n di n t e r q u a r t i l er a n g e sw e r e reported, and 2-group comparisons were carried out using Wilcoxon-Mann -Whitney tests. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare log-transformed antibody concentrations. Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of serum antibodies and their 95% con dence intervals (CIs) were calculated and are given based on log-transformed anti-HAV antibody concentrations. The age calculation was based on the date of the priming vac- cination in 2005. Socioeconomic data from the 2003 serosurvey were used to assess the HAV infection risk between 2003 and 2005. The primary cutoffs of the serological follow-up were n t i - HAV antibody concentrations. A mixed linear regression model allowing for random inter- cept and slope was used to ascertain the longitudinal develop- ment of the titers incorporating the effect of possibly associated factors, such as age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Vaccine ef- fectiveness was calculated based on the number of breakthrough infections among the vaccinated children and the estimated number of HAV infections among a hypothetical equally sized group of unvaccinated children [ 19]. All analyses were carried out using Stata software (version 13.1; StataCorp). RESULTS Prevaccination Study Phase A total of 130 children who were seronegative in 2003 received a priming dose of virosomal hepatitis A vaccine (Epaxal) in 2005. For logistic reasons, no second check for seronegativity was per- formed before this vaccination. The rst postvaccination serol- ogy 3 months later revealed that in the 13 -16 months between Single-Dose Hepatitis A Immunization JID 2016:214 (15 November) 1499the serosurvey at the end of 2003 and the January 2005 single- dose vaccination, 25 (19.2%) of initially seronegative children had contracted hepatitis A subclinically. For the clinical and se- rological follow-up, the 130 children were, therefore, divided into 2 groups, termed \"noninfected \"(n = 105) and \"infected \" (n = 25, Figure 1). All the infected children had 3-month post- vaccination anti-HAV levels >8000 mIU/mL, with negative anti-HAV IgM in 23 and borderline anti-HAV IgM results in 2 children, whereas in the 105 noninfected children immuniza- tion resulted in anti-HAV levels of 17 -572 mIU/mL. The group 3 -<6-year-old children had a slightly (not signi - cantly) higher incidence of HAV infection before vaccination compared with those aged <3 or 6 years. Although reports of no refrigerator, no tap water, or no flush toilet in the house- hold were associated with a slightly higher risk of HAV infec- tion, none of these socioeconomic factors had a signi cant influence (Table 1). Demography and Socioeconomic Factors The median age of the 130 children was 3.6 years (range, 1.7 -17 years), and 45.4% were girls (Table 1). The socioeconomicparameters had not changed signi cantly between the original data collection in 2003 and the second collection in 2005 (data not shown). In the course of the 7.5-year follow-up, 9 (8.6%) of the noninfected and 4 (16%) of the infected children were lost to follow-up (Figure 1). The 96 noninfected children with com- plete follow-up did not differ in their demographic or socioeco- nomic characteristics from the initial group of 105 noninfected children (data not shown). Serological Follow-up Immunization of the 105 noninfected children with a single- dose vaccine resulted 3 months later in an anti-HAV antibody concentration (GMC) of 72 mIU/mL (Table 2;F i g u r e 2). Concen- trations in these children reached a maximum of 101 mIU/mL in 2007, declining slowly toward 80 mIU/mL in 2012, followed by a 29.7-fold rise (95% CI, -36.0) to 2399 mIU/mL on chal- lenge. The anamnestic response on boosting was also observed in children whose antibody levels had dropped intermittently or remained <10 mIU/mL for years (Table 3). Girls responded to the priming vaccination with a higher anti- HAV GMC than boys, a difference that remained borderline Figure 1. Study flow chart.

Whereas the 2 older age groups had fairly similar GMC antibody values throughout the follow-up, the youngest children (aged <3 years), except in 2005, had signi cantly higher anti-HAV antibody concentrations from 2006 until 2012 (all P.002; Figure 3). Although boys had lower anti-HAV antibody levels after vac- cination, they lost anti-HAV antibodies at a slower rate thangirls, even after taking age and socioeconomic status were taken into account in a mixed linear regression model (8.8 mIU/mL less decrease per year; 95% CI, .7 -16.9 mIU/mL). Sim- ilarly, antibody concentrations rose higher in younger children after vaccination, but with increasing age these concentrations dropped slower (for each year of higher age, 3.1 mIU/mL less antibody decline per year; 95% CI, 1.6 -4.6 mIU/mL).

Low Responders and Breakthrough Infection At 3 -15 months after the HAV vaccine priming dose, 16 children had no measurable (<10 mIU/mL) or very low (10 to <20 mIU/mL) antibody concentrations. Altogether, 8 children lost detectable anti-HAV antibodies in the course of the fol- low-up, either intermittently (n = 4) or permanently (n = 4; Table 3). Before the 2012 booster challenge, 5 children had an- tibody levels of only 11 -19 mIU/mL (data not shown), and 4 had no detectable antibodies at all (Table 3). An asymptomaticbreakthrough infection occurred between 2010 and 2012 in a low responder, an at the time of vaccination (2005) 5.6-year- old girl (anti-HAV 7106 mIU/mL before booster; anti-HAV IgM negative; Table 3). Clinical Follow-up No adverse events after vaccination were reported. None of the children ever presented with hepatitis symptoms during the en- tire follow-up period, including the child with the serological breakthrough infection. HAV Exposure and Vaccine Effectiveness The constant circulation of HAV in the community was docu- mented by the hepatitis A screening study run in parallel; throughout 2006 -2010, an average of 5 -7 cases of acute hepa- titis A were diagnosed monthly, mainly in pediatric patients (86% aged 2 -10 years) [ 18].

During the 7.5-year postvaccination follow-up, 1 of the 105 responder (sub- ject subclinically infected with HAV, as in- dicated by a steep rise in antibody concentration (from <10 up to 7106 mIU/mL), representing an attack rate of approximately 1.0% (0.95% for 1 of 105 children and 1.0% for 1 of 96 with complete follow-up). Based on the known annual risk of infec- tion of (at least) 15% [ 16,20], we would have expected 58 wild HAV infections in an unvaccinated group of 96 matched chil- dren in 7.5 years, with a probability of 99%. Based on the 1 breakthrough infection in the vaccinated group of 96 children, the vaccine effectiveness with respect to sterilizing immunity worked out to be 98.3% (95% CI, 87.8% -99.8%). DISCUSSION The present study and the concurrently conducted community hepatitis A screening [ 18] conrm a persistently high HAV en- demicity in Nicaragua [ 16,20]. The 25 infections among 130children, however, were too few to document a signi cant influ- ence of any demographic or socioeconomic parameters on the infection risk. The well-mixed geographic distribution of cases over the area of the city of Le\u00f3n further emphasizes the high and evenly spread level of HAV circulation the study population was exposed to. For both infected and noninfected children, the anti-HAV antibody levels declined slightly during the 7.5 years of fol- low-up. The early loss of measurable antibody within a few years after a single priming dose in 8 noninfected children (8.3%) has been described for up to a third of adult travelers [14,15,21] and is somewhat higher than the results found in a large Argentinian study [ 22], in which antibody levels became unmeasurable within 5 years after a single priming dose in only 2.5% of children [ 22]. The somewhat variable course of the an- tibody levels in the vaccinated, noninfected children \u2014falling slightly from 2005 to 2006 and then rising again to a maximum in 2007, before nally declining toward the trough level of 2012 \u2014may be ascribed to the fact that not all serum samples could be measured in parallel (see Methods), ampli ed by the assay variability inherent in immune assay testing [ 23]. The better immune responses in girls compared with boys and in younger children are known features. Stronger immune responses in favor of the female sex are documented for many different vaccines [ 24], including inactivated hepatitis A vac- cines [ 25,26]. The higher antibody response in the youngest age group can be attributed to the lower body volume and there- fore a relatively higher vaccine dose. This effect has also been observed in earlier pediatric trials studying 2 dose levels of Epaxal [ 27]. The calculated 98.3% protection, based on the 1 break- through infection among the 96 children followed up and a 15% annual risk of infection, is in line with the known excellent protective ef cacy of the virosomal [ 20] and other inactivated hepatitis A vaccines [ 1]. To our knowledge, no asymptomatic cases of proved HAV infection after administration of an inac- tivated HAV vaccine have been reported to date. Only clinical breakthrough infections have been reported, all of them in adult travelers after the priming dose [ 28-34]. Our subclinical but serologically documented breakthrough infection in an 11-year-old girl can be explained either by the asymptomatic course of hepatitis A in about 50% of children at this age [ 3] or by a mitigating effect of the priming dose [ 20,35]a n di s quite different from the questionable serological \"natural boost- ers\"reported in the literature (see below). To our knowledge, 2 publications have reported rises in anti- HAV antibody levels observed during serological long-term fol- low-up of vaccinated children, labeled \"natural boosters, \" through circulating HAV encounters [ 22,36]. In 1 study, anti- body levels in 1 of 93 children barely doubled in the second year, compared with the previous value [ 36]. In the second study, such natural boosters were reported with yearly varying Figure 3. Anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV) geometric mean concentration (GMCs) 2003-2012 ( prebooster) among all 105 noninfected children ( A), as well as by sex (B) and by age ( C); bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Single-Dose Hepatitis A Immunization JID 2016:214 (15 November) 1503rates in up to one-third of children during 5-year follow-up [22]. The antibody levels rose in the subjects concerned by only 80% -100%, and the consecutive serum samples were not tested in parallel (C. Espul, personal communication). In our experience, testing of consecutive serum samples that is not done in parallel, that is, does not use for all samples the same enzyme immunoassay test kit lot in the same test run, can easily result in up to 50% -100% variations in anti-HAV antibody levels (unpublished data). Contrary to the postulated role of natural boosting in maintaining long-term immunity for certain vaccine preventable infections [ 37], in our opinion there is no serological natural-booster phenomenon for hepatitis A once anti-HAV immunity has been established, neither after natural infection, nor after successful vaccination. Otherwise in popula- tions living in endemic settings with continuous HAV exposure, constantly high anti-HAV antibody levels would be observed once population-wide seroprotection has been reached. On the contrary, a constant fall in antibody levels from age 15 -20 years onward has been documented in an age-strati ed, cross- sectional serosurvey in Nicaragua [ 16].All children, even those with very low or nally undetectable antibody levels, had a strong humoral immune response after the booster challenge dose, thus con rming the persistence of immune memory, as already documented in adult travelers for up to 11 years after the priming dose [ 21].An intact immune memory, despite the loss of any measurable anti-HAV antibod- ies, has likewise been documented in adults after 1 dose [ 21], as well as after 2 doses [ 38]. This strong antibody memory recall response not only re flects residual B-cell response capacity but indicates also that the rst vaccine dose elicits an ef cient priming of the immune system via an early proliferative T-cell response, as has recently been reported; a single HAV vaccine dose promotes HAV-speci c cellular memory immune re- sponses similar to natural infection, and the HAV-speci c T-cell immunity induced by primary vaccination persists inde- pendently of the circulating antibody levels achieved [ 39]. Our study has several limitations. No controls to document HAV infections in the population were included; however, HAV infections were monitored at the community level by a hepatitis A screening study conducted in parallel, which Figure 4.

Seronegativity was not retested before vaccination, leaving space to scrutinize whether all 25 HAV infections between 2003 and 2005 had occurred before vaccination; the anti-HAV IgM test- ing performed 3 months after vaccination showed, however, that the HAV infections detected serologically had most likely occurred before the rst vaccination, because the infection- induced, short-lived (3 -6 months) anti-HAV IgM antibodies were either not measurable (n = 23) or borderline (n = 2) at this time point [ 4]. Although not all sequential serum samples obtained from each child could be tested in parallel, all anti- HAV measurements were done by the same expert (G. F.), using the same immune assay test system in the same laborato- ry, thus minimizing the variability inherent to anti-HAV anti- body measurement with enzyme immune assays [ 23]. Originally, the vaccination schedule for inactivated hepatitis A vaccines \u2014that is, a priming dose followed 6 -18 months later by a booster dose \u2014was based on early projections of waning antibody levels [ 1]. From 1999 onward, some countries in tran- sition from higher to lower endemicity started to successfully introduce 2-dose UMV against hepatitis A [ 5-7]. Because there was evidence that a single hepatitis A vaccine dose can control outbreaks of hepatitis A and induce immune memory [1,14,15], as therst country, Argentina successfully intro- duced the single-dose UMV in 2005 [ 13,40,41]. This single-dose strategy, encouraged by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 2012 [ 1], seems to be an effective and more affordable option to facilitate the introduction of UMV against hepatitis A [ 1,11,12]. The WHO recommends that HAV vaccination be integrated into the national immuni- zation programs for children aged 1 year, if indicated on the basis of the country 's hepatitis A burden, and that the inclusion of single-dose immunization schedules may be considered, as long as a HAV surveillance and monitoring programs are im- plemented [ 1]. According to current WHO data (information taken from the country pro les, last updated 8 January 2016) [42], there are today 4 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Paraguay) using single-dose and 11 countries (Bahrain, Greece, Israel, Mongolia, Panama, Qatar, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, United States, and Uruguay) using 2-dose UMV with inactivated HAV vaccines [ 42]. China has UMV mainly using a single-dose licensed, live atten- uated hepatitis A vaccine [ 7,42]. Another 11 countries ( A u s t r a l i a ,C h i l e ,I c e l a n d ,I t a l y ,K a z a k h s t a n ,M e x i c o ,N e w Zealand, Moldavia, Russia, Slovenia, and Spain) report vacci- nating only certain risk groups in the entire country or only in certain regions [ 42]. In summary, this prospective, cohort pilot study demonstrat- ed that, in children living in hyperendemic settings, 1 dose of virosomal hepatitis A vaccine is suf cient to activate a solid im- mune memory and may provide long-term protection, thus supporting the WHO single-dose UMV strategy.Notes Acknowledgments. We thank all the parents and their children and the study staff of Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua, who made this study possible. Disclaimer. The industry funder had no role in study design; data collection, analysis, or interpretation; or writing of the manuscript. The cor- responding author had full access to the study data and nal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. Financial support. The serosurvey 2003 and the rst 5 years (2005 - 2010) of the follow-up were sponsored by Crucell Switzerland AG (formerly Berna Biotech); the 2012 follow-up and the immune memory assessment were supported and funded by the universities of Bern, Z\u00fcrich, and Antwerp and the Technical University of Munich. Potential con flicts of interest. O. M., C. Hatz, and M. E. in the past have received research funding from Berna Biotech/Crucell for vaccine studies. G. F., in the past and at the time of the study, has provided labora- tory support for Berna Biotech/Crucell 's hepatitis A vaccine projects. P. V. D. acted as chief and principal investigator for Berna Biotecch/Crucell vaccine trials conducted on behalf of the University of Antwerp, for which the University obtains research grants from vaccine manufacturers. C. Herzog was until 2011 an employee of Berna Biotech/Crucell. All other authors report no potential con flicts. All authors have submitted the ICMJE Form for Disclosure of Potential Con flicts of Interest. Con flicts that the ed- itors consider relevant to the content of the manuscript have been disclosed.
