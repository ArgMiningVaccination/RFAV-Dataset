Article published online: 2021-04-30Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases were identi ed in early December 2019 in China, and the rst case in India was reported on January 30, 2020, in Kerala.1Since then, India has been grappling with the ever-increasing number of cases and various approaches for the containment of infec- tion. India has a unique health care system, with a pluralisticapproach wherein Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy (AYUSH) systems have been integ- rated in the primary health care provided through wellnessclinics across the country. The public health services are free of cost, both at primary and secondary levels of health care. Of these, homeopathic services are available at approxi-mately 30% of centers and cater to about one- fth of the annual patient turnover. These services are immensely pop- ular, even among the AYUSH systems, and are being opti-mally utilized. 2In Delhi too, the Government offers integrated health care services at their health centers, where Ayurveda, Unani and Homeopathy services co-exist withconventional services under one roof. Patients can choose any one or more services at their discretion. Presently, 107 Delhi Government wellness centers have integrated homeopathy facilities. In a survey of these clinics, 85.2% of patients felt that the homeopathy services are essential and a majority of conventional doctors felt thathomeopathy clinics within the same premises are bene - cial. 3Respiratory ailments are among the top 10 diseases reported in the annual morbidity pro ling of patients visit- ing these centers.2Studies have shown that homeopathic medicines have a bene cial effect in in fluenza-like illnesses (ILIs)4,5but their effectiveness in COVID-19 is yet to be established. It is suggested that homeopaths should take full advan- tage of this rare opportunity and aim to demonstrate homeo- pathy 'se fcacy in COVID-19 based on the modern methods of fundamental and clinical research.6The homeopathy community can analyze the available data about potential medicines used for ILI. Medicines such as Bryonia alba , Calendula of cinalis and Passi flora incarnata might prove to be inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and are worth investigating for the treatment of COVID-19.7Ran- domized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered to be thegold standard in clinical research and assume the highest importance in evidence-based medicine. A well-designed randomized placebo-controlled study requires prior experi-ence and outcome documentation. Observational studies provide such prior experience, as they describe \"real-world \"care settings and allow for a more generalized and robust estimation of effects in clinical prac- tice; they are thus an important approach to assist in designing RCTs. 8The need is for a series of systematic studies that includes collection and analysis of good-quality cases treated with homeopathy. Prognostic factor research is an important technique for the analysis of cohorts of such cases.\"Prognostic factor \"means a characteristic of a patient that can be used to estimate the chance of recovery from a disease. In homeopathy, doctors prescribe medicines basedon the speci c symptoms of the patients and expect that a medicine will work based on their experience that speci c symptoms of the patient indicate speci c medicines; the prevalence of such symptoms is higher in a population responding well to a speci c medicine than in the remainder of the population. 9,10Such symptoms are considered as prognostic factors and can play an important role in accu- rately prescribing medicines during RCTs. The Government of India has pooled all available resour- ces, including the AYUSH sector, for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic using scienti c, evidence-based, solu- tions and with a caution against false claims.11An inter- disciplinary AYUSH research and development task force has been constituted with the objective of identifying potentialpreventive and therapeutic approaches within these systems. 12 Homeopathic doctors have been posted in COVID Care Centers and COVID Testing Centers as part of a team with conventional doctors and have been authorized to provide an integrated care package including homeopathy for COVID-19patients. Objectives The primary objective was to identify clinically useful ho-meopathic remedies and their characteristic indicationsusing the prognostic factor research model for COVID-19. The secondary objective was to catalog the symptomatology of the disease. Methods Study Design and Settings This was an open-label, multi-centric, observational studyperformed from April 2020 to July 2020. Patients treated were con rmed COVID-19 positive cases, de ned as those with positive results on real-time reverse-transcriptase who gave informed verbal consent to take homeopathic medicines were pre-scribed based on their individualized symptoms. Medicines procured from a GMP-certi edrm were used. The homeopathic remedies prescribed in all these patientswere in addition to their standard conventional treatment as advocated by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. The conventional drugs were mainlysymptomatic, such as paracetamol, antibiotics, cetirizine, cough syrups, or multi-vitamins. No patient was given cortico- steroids or antivirals in this group. Homeopathic remedieswere prescribed based on individualization at the discretion of treating doctors. Twenty-eight quali ed and experienced ho- meopathic doctors, working at 23 homeopathic clinics opera-tional at conventional health centers and hospitals, recorded cases in a specially designed format and analyzed each patient 's data for prescribing a speci c remedy. Formal approval for the study was obtained from the relevant research ethics committee and was conveyed by letter no: F/No5(11)/93/NHMC/Academic/PG 2007 onward/ Homeopathy Vol. 110 No. 3/2021 \u00a9 2021.

Participants All RT-PCR-con rmed COVID-19 patients, treated at COVID Care Centers and in home isolation, were studied. All patients with mild to moderate disease were considered. Mild cases were patients with uncomplicated upper respira-tory tract infection without evidence of breathlessness or hypoxia (normal oxygen saturation). Moderate cases were those with pneumonia but no signs of severe disease, SpO 2 <94% (range 90 -94%) on room air, and respiratory rate more than or equal to 24 per minute.14Patients with co-morbid- ities were also included in the study. Variables The variables were: \u0081Demographic pro le and clinical presentation of patients. \u0081Homeopathic medicines and their indications that can be used as prognostic factors. Data Source Doctors were trained in data collection at thestart of the study.A bespoke Excel spreadsheet was shared with all doctors who then, on a daily basis, added data of their respective cases from their centers. The spreadsheet contained 71 elds covering a spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms. It also contained elds related to the mental and emotional states of patients to record associated fear and/or anxiety. 15,16The prescriptions were based on the individualization of symptoms. The spreadsheet also contained elds for detailed follow-ups and outcomes after 1 week of treatment. The identifying information ofpatients was kept con dential at each center by recording their registration numbers instead of names. Follow-up was done daily until complete resolution of symptoms or up to a week. Patients who were in home isolation were followed up telephonically every day. In eachfollow-up, the patient was asked about any change in their symptom intensity and overall well-being, as is done in any homeopathic case follow-up in a regular setting. The Out-come in Relation to Impact on Daily Living (ORIDL) scale, which ranges from -4t o\u00fe4, was used for patient assessment at each follow-up. 17 Regular online meetings with all doctors were organized to ensure the quality of data collection. The data were regularly monitored, and any issues related to outliers,misreported or missing data, etc. were quickly resolved. This was done to ensure consistency in data, maintain the good quality of cases, and to reduce bias. An important challenge in prognostic factor research is establishing causality between medicine and improved health, as the cure may be due to the effect of the prescribedhomeopathic medicine or other factors such as spontaneous and natural recovery or placebo effect. The following selection criteria were adopted for identifying good-quality cases: \u0081Only those cases with a reported outcome of ORIDL \u00fe3o r \u00fe4, and within 7 days of starting homeopathic treatment,in both chief complaint and general well-being, as this is considered as a desirable effect of the homeopathic prescription. \u0081Improvement began within a few hours of starting ho- meopathic treatment. Twenty-four hours from the start oftreatment was considered as cut-off time. \u0081Continuing improvement after repeated doses of the selected remedy. After data collection on the spreadsheet was complete, each of the above cases was further reviewed using certaindomains of the Modi ed Naranjo Criteria for assessing causal attribution of clinical outcomes. 18Out of 10 domains, only the following four domains were considered: Domain 1: Was there an improvement in the main symp- tom or condition for which the homeopathic medicinewas prescribed? Domain 2 : Did the clinical improvement occur within a plausible time-frame relative to the drug intake?Domain 5: Did overall well-being improve? Domain 10: Did repeat dosing create similar clinical improvement? Cases with inadequate information or where causality could not be established were excluded from the analysis. Mild to moderate cases are known to improve spontaneouslyin 10 to 14 days; therefore, the cut-off time for assessment was set as 7 days, to eliminate, as far as possible, cases with spontaneous recovery. Cases with the following attributes were excluded from the analysis ( Fig. 1 ) \u0081Inconclusive cases/lost to follow-up/incomplete cases/inad- equate information. Fig. 1 Flowchart of the study.

In such cases \"which medicine worked \"was dif cult to assess and speci c causality could not be established. \u0081Cases in which only one or two doses of a medicine were given, and it was not possible to relate improvement tothese doses. Statistical Methods Prognostic factor analysis is based on the calculation of likelihood ratio (LR) to improve the reliability of prescrip- tions for future studies. It is expressed in a statistical formulaknown as Bayes 'theorem: posterior odds \u00bcLR/C2prior in the target population) /C4(preva- lence in the remainder of the population). The target popu-lation is the population in which the medicine has a curative effect. 9 The LR of a symptom indicates a change in the chance of curative action of that medicine when that symptom is present in a patient. If LR is >1, it implies that the chance that the medicine will be effective increases if that symptomis present. 9The higher the LR, the more strongly the medi- cine is indicated for that symptom. If the 95% con dence interval (95% CI) of LR does not contain 1 (i.e., the lower valueof the range is not less than 1), then it is considered meaningful. Results A total of 327 (203 male, 124 female) patients with COVID-19 were treated with adjunct homeopathic remedies; the major- ity were in the age range 18 to 60 years ( Table 1 ). All cases showed improvement of varying degrees and no adverse reactions were noticed. A total of 298 cases were con rmed for COVID-19 via an RT-PCR-positive test result. Two hundredand forty-four patientshad a historyofcontact with con rmed COVID-19 cases either at home or at the workplace. Twohundred and ninety-six patients had mild disease ( Table 1 ). A total of 258 patients were prescribed a single homeo- pathic remedy, whilst in 69 cases two or more homeopathicremedies were sequentially prescribed as per need. RT-PCR testing was done after homeopathic treatment in 35 cases after 2 to 3 weeks, and all became negative. Testing could notbe done in other cases due to revised guidelines according to which a patient could be discharged after 10 days of symp- tom onset and no fever for 3 days (in mild cases) and absenceof fever without antipyretics, resolution of breathlessness and no oxygen requirement (in moderate cases), and without the need for testing prior to discharge. 19 A total of 211 cases met the selection criteria for improve- ment of COVID-19 symptoms and were analyzed. A total of 116 cases were excluded from the analysis, due to variousreasons such as inadequate follow-up (22 cases), being asymptomatic (seven cases), or where causality could not be established (42 cases) ( Fig. 1 ). The most common complaints were fatigue, sore throat, dry cough, myalgia, fever, dry mouth and throat, increased thirst, headache, decreased appetite, anxiety, and altered taste( Table 2 ). Twenty-seven medicines in varying potencies were pre- scribed, usually starting from 30C ( Table 3 ). The medicines were repeated as per the need of an individual case, usually three to four times daily. In some cases, they were repeated more frequently. Arsenicum album and Bryonia alba were prescribed in 61 cases each. Gelsemium sempervirens was prescribed in 19 cases and Pulsatilla nigricans in 13 cases. Some less-known medicines, e.g., Magnesia muriaticum and Wyethia, also showed good response though the number of such cases was very low ( Table 3 ). LR was calculated for the frequently occurring symptoms of the four most frequently prescribed remedies ( Table 4 ). LR>1 indicates that there is an increased chance that a medicine will be effective if a certain symptom is present. By calculating LR, a comparative could be drawn, symptom- wise, between these four remedies for COVID-19 cases. Ablank in Table 4 indicates that there was no patient responding well to this medicine when the symptom was present. Arsenicum album showed meaningful LR for the symp- toms running nose (LR \u00bc3.07; 95% CI, 1.27 to 7.42) and anxiety (LR \u00bc2.28; 95% CI, 1.44 to 3.59). Bryonia alba showed LR for the symptoms dry of mouth and throat(LR\u00bc2.05; 95% CI, 1.46 to 2.87) and increased thirst (LR \u00bc1.88; 95% CI, 1.28 to 2.74).

Discussion In this study, homeopathic remedies seemed helpful in COVID- 19 patients in an integrated treatment regimen, even in caseswith co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease or hypothyroidism. No adverse reac- tion with any of the homeopathic medicines was observed.This disease presents a spectrum of symptoms ranging from fever and respiratory dysfunction to gastrointestinal com- plaints and loss of taste or smell. COVID-19, being a newdisease, lacked any literature or past experience with the use of homeopathic remedies. Besides, in an epidemic, rare and peculiar symptoms are dif cult to nd. Therefore, prog- nostic factor research assumes importance wherein symptoms are regarded as factors that help in establishing the relation- ship between speci c symptoms (prognostic factors) andmedicines. 20This is done by calculating the LR of symptoms attributed to those homeopathic medicines that are founduseful. Even common symptoms of a disease can assume importance if the LR of such symptoms is greater than 1 for a given remedy. Interestingly, LR also guides the con rmation of any remedy indicated for a set of symptoms. Cases that are \"false-positive cures \", i.e., causality wrongly attributed to a remedy, cause underestimation of LR of aspeci c symptom for a speci cr e m e d y . 21Therefore, cases were selected based on selection criteria that also included the four domains of the Modi ed Naranjo Criteria that are relevant for acute diseases. Out of 327 cases reported, only 211 cases ful lled the criteria and were analyzed. The reliability and reproducibility of homeopathic pre- scriptions were assessed by calculating the LR of symptoms, medicine-wise. LR was estimated for symptoms attributed to the homeopathic remedies found useful. LR was consideredand compared for the four most commonly prescribed homeopathic medicines. The medicine that showed high LR (>1) for a symptom was considered for drawingTable 3 Medicines prescribed ( n\u00bc211) Medicine Number of patients cured Arsenicum 61 Gelsemium sempervirens 19 casesCases (%) Fatigue 100 47.4 Sore throat 91 43.1 Dry cough 83 39.3 Myalgia 82 38.9 Fever 80 37.9Dry mouth and throat 77 36.5 Increased thirst 67 31.8 Headache 65 30.8 Decreased appetite 57 27.0 Anxiety 52 24.6 Altered taste a57 27.0 A sensation of heat in the body 38 18.0 Productive cough 35 16.6 Disturbed sleep 34 16.1 Chest discomfort 30 14.2 Loss of smell 28 13.3 Dyspnea 24 11.4 Constipation 22 10.4 Decreased thirst 19 9.0 Diarrhea 18 8.5 Nausea 13 6.2 Abdominal pain 10 4.7 Flatulence 8 3.8 Increased perspiration 7 3.3 Vomiting 5 2.4 aThis includes data for loss of taste.

Comparisons were made among the four most frequently used medicines, based on LR and associated 95% CI calcu-lations: Arsenicum album was most indicated in COVID-19 cases presenting with anxiety and running nose; Bryonia alba was indicated in COVID-19 cases primarily presenting with a dry cough, with increased thirst, constipation, and dryness of the mouth; Gelsemium sempervirens will act better for symptoms of fever, chills, fatigue, decreased thirst,myalgia, and decreased appetite; Pulsatilla nigricans was more indicated in COVID-19 cases presenting with loss of taste and loss of smell.In a study carried out in Hong Kong on 18 mild COVID-19 cases, Bryonia alba andGelsemiumsempervirens were indicated in four and 12 cases respectively. One of the homeopathic rubrics for Bryonia alba was \"thirst for large quantities of water \", similar to the observation in this study. For Gelsemium sempervirens , homeopathic rubrics were \"weakness, chills and thirstlessness \", similar to the observation in this study. 22 An Italian public homeopathy clinic studied approximate- ly 50 COVID-19 cases. In the rst phase of the study, Arsenicum album was prescribed to patients with flu symp- toms and to \"boost their immune system \". In the second phase, Bryonia alba and Gelsemium sempervirens gave good results in the private practice setting.23An article on homeo- pathic clinical practice on COVID-19 cases in New YorkTable 4 Likelihood ratio calculations for symptoms of four medicines Dry cough 83 18 0.68 38 2.08 6 0.79 2 0.38 Productive cough 35 9 0.85 7 0.61 3 0.95 4 1.97Sore throat 91 26 0.98 33 1.40 5 0.59 3 0.52 Fever 80 23 0.99 23 0.99 13 1.96 5 1.02 Myalgia 82 24 1.02 27 1.21 13 1.90 2 0.38Headache 65 13 0.61 24 1.44 8 1.42 5 1.27Fatigue 100 36 1.38 27 0.91 16 1.92 3 0.47 Constipation 22 2 0.25 16 6.56 1 0.73 Sensation of heat in the body 38 13 1.28 11 1.00 5 1.53 2 0.85Abdominal pain 10 3 1.05 3 1.05 1 1.12 1 1.69 Dry mouth and throat 77 23 1.05 35 2.05 5 0.70 5 1.06 Chest discomfort 30 8 0.89 13 1.88 2 0.72 2 1.09Increased perspiration 7 1 0.41 3 1.84 2 4.04 Anxiety 52 25 2.28 7 0.38 9 2.12 2 0.61 Increased thirst 67 27 1.66 29 1.88 1 0.15 1 0.23Chills 24 4 0.49 12 10.11 3 2.18 Dyspnea 24 5 0.65 10 1.76 3 1.44 1 0.66 Loss of smell 28 6 0.67 7 0.82 4 2.54Flatulence 8 1 0.35 3 1.48 Vomiting 5 3 3.69 1 0.61 Blocked nose 15 7 2.15 1 0.72 2 2.34Nausea 13 4 1.09 4 1.09 1 0.84 2 2.77Decreased appetite 57 15 0.88 17 1.05 10 2.15 5 1.46 Decreased thirst 19 2 0.29 3 0.46 8 7.35 3 2.86 Altered taste 57 10 0.52 26 2.06 4 0.76 8 2.49Diarrhea 18 5 0.95 4 0.70 1 0.59 1 0.90 Disturbed sleep 34 14 1.72 7 0.64 4 1.35 1 0.46 Retrosternal burning 10 3 1.05 2 0.61 1 1.12Sneezing 9 5 3.07 1 0.31 Running nose 18 10 3.07 3 0.49 1 0.90 Homeopathy Vol. 110 No. 3/2021 \u00a9 2021.

It shortlisted Gelsemium sempervirens, Senega and Antimonium arsenicosum as potentially curative remedies based on symptomatology and stages. 24 A wide spectrum of medicines was used in the present study ( Table 3 ). Successful prescriptions are based on careful individualization of symptoms, either for an individ-ual patient or collectively in epidemic outbreaks. 25Homeo- pathy has played a positive role in controlling epidemics afflicting humankind in the past, as in the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918.26These medicines have shown promising results for epidemic diseases such as cholera, in fluenza, dengue, and Japanese encephalitis.5,27-34 In a separate observational study at a COVID-19 health center at Nehru Homoeopathic Medical College, New Delhi, 196 patients were prescribed 28 remedies, out of whichBryonia alba, Arsenicum album, Pulsatilla nigricans, Nux vomica, Rhus toxicodendron and Gelsemium sempervirens were most frequently indicated (article in press). Four ofthese medicines are common to the present study. The majority of COVID-19 cases (80%) present mild symp- toms and recover with general care and without developingany severe symptoms. 35Relevant selection criteriawere there- fore followed to rule out bias due to such instances. However, there is still a possibility that the database of cases withcomplete recovery can be attributed to causes other than the prescribed homeopathic medicine. Therefore, RCTs be- come even more important to prove the ef cacy of medicines. The results of our study and other observational studies will be used for designing RCTs that test the effect of a group of selected homeopathic medicines. Conclusion Homeopathic medicines have shown encouraging results inCOVID cases. The prescribing indications of Arsenicum album, Bryonia sempervirens nigri- cans have been identi ed using prognostic factor research. This information will be useful for more accurate homeo-pathic prescribing to COVID-19 patients in future RCT research. Highlights \u0081Clinical data were collected from contemporary homeo- pathic practice in integrated COVID-19 care centers inIndia. \u0081Prescribing indications of the four most frequently used homeopathic medicines, i.e., Arsenicum album, using prognostic factor research. may improve the accuracy of future homeo- pathic prescribing of COVID-19 patients.
