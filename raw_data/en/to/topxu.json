M.D., M.P.H.1 micronutrient therapy (IVMT), and specifically the Myers' Cocktail, is a popular ap- proach for treating fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) among complementary and alternative medicine practition- ers, but its efficacy is uncertain. This trial assessed the feasibility, safety, and provided insights into the effi-cacy of this therapy.Design: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study. Locations: The study locations were an academic research center, teaching hospital, and affiliated Integrative Medicine Center in Derby, CT.Subjects: The subjects were 34 adults with American College of Rheumatology (ACR)-defined FMS. Intervention: Subjects were randomly assigned either to treatment (weekly infusions of IVMT) or to placebo (weekly infusions of lactated Ringer's solution) for 8 weeks.Outcome measures: Primary outcome was change in the Tender Point Index, assessed 8 and 12 weeks after ini- tiation. Secondary measures included a Visual Analog Scale to assess global pain, and validated measures ofphysical function (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), mood (Beck Depression Index), and quality of life(Health Status Questionnaire 2.0).Results: Clinically significant improvements were noted (of a magnitude similar to other effective interven- tions). However, in part because of the high placebo response and the small sample size, no statistically sig-nificant differences were seen between groups, in any outcome measure, at 8 and 16 weeks. Statistically sig-nificant within-group differences were seen in both the intervention and placebo groups, demonstrating atreatment effect for both IVMT and placebo. At 8 weeks, the IVMT group experienced significantly improvedtender points, pain, depression, and quality of life directly following treatment (all p/H113490.02), while the placebo group experienced significantly improved tender points only ( p/H113490.05). The treatment effects of IVMT per- sisted at 4 weeks postintervention for tender points, pain, and quality of life, while placebo effects persistedonly for tender points. A single minor adverse event was noted in one subject in the intervention group.Conclusions: This first controlled pilot study established the safety and feasibility of treating FMS with IVMT. Most subjects experienced relief as compared to baseline, but no statistically significant differences were seenbetween IVMT and placebo. The efficacy of IVMT for fibromyalgia, relative to placebo, is as yet uncertain. 247Introduction Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a common clinical dis- order of unknown etiology characterized by widespread pain and muscle tenderness often accompanied by chronicfatigue, sleep disturbance, and depressed mood.1Approxi- mately 3.4% of women in the United States suffer from FMS,10 times the prevalence in men. 2 The uncertain etiology of FMS2complicates a rational ap- proach to pharmacotherapy. Several recently completed tri- 1Prevention Research Center, Yale University School of Medicine, Derby, CT. 2Institute for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark, NJ.als demonstrate promise, though not without concern for se- rious adverse effects. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) are commonly utilized, 3despite the fact that they have been found to have negligible effectiveness,4along with potential gastrointestinal and renal toxicity.5In clinical tri- als, the atypical opioid, tramadol, has shown some promisein controlling pain with inconsistent results in functional im-provement, 6although a combination with acetaminophen has shown promising results in a randomized trial.7,8A re- cent series of treatment guidelines expresses caution in theuse of tramadol for FMS due to the potential for opiate de-pendence. 6A controlled trial of prednisone9resulted in no improvement; most measured variables showed a trend to-ward deterioration. The limited data available on the use ofselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have shown them tobe less effective than the tricyclic agents. 10Pregabalin was found to be efficacious for FM symptoms in various dosesin randomized trials lasting between 8 and 14 weeks; the ini-tial trial resulted in the first U.S. Food and Drug Adminis-tration (FDA) approval for a drug to treat FM. 11-13Of note, the most recent trial of pregabalin excluded \"placebo re-sponders,\" limiting external validity null. serotonin-norepinephrine as a 6-month randomized trial (RCT) on pain and self-perceived improvement. Inthe treatment arm with the highest dose (120 mg/d), 27.2%of patients discontinued the study due to adverse effects. 16 Duloxetine was approved for fibromyalgia in June 2008. Dietary interventions have demonstrated some promise; FMS symptoms decreased in patients eating open-label trials using nu- tritional supplementation of whole food extracts,plant constituents, or single vitamins 19,20reported an in- crease in pain tolerance and overall quality of life. As is true of many conditions that are poorly understood and rather resistant to conventional treatments, FMS oftencompels those afflicted to seek complementary and alternativemedicine (CAM). 21,22These CAM interventions include nutri- tional and herbal supplements, spiritual practices, visits to al-ternative practitioners, dietary modifications, acupuncture,and osteopathy. While patient satisfaction with these treat-ments is ranked moderate to high, there currently exists lim-ited evidence of the efficacy of any specific intervention. 23-26 Several small trials have shown promise for a combination ofmalic acid and Cocktail,\"29a solution of water-sol- uble vitamins and minerals, is a popular approach amongCAM practitioners. Interest in and use of IVMT is growingas evidenced by the number of clinics across the UnitedStates offering IVMT as a principal treatment. Members froma wide range of national medical associations including TheAmerican College for Advancement in Medicine (ACAM),The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians, theAmerican Holistic Medical Association, the American Acad-emy of Pain Management, the Great Lakes College of Clini-cal Medicine, and the International Society of Orthomolecu-lar Medicine (ISOM) report using IVMT. Data from over12,000 patient encounters obtained by an online survey ofmembers of these organizations suggest that IVMT is widelyused for a variety of conditions, most often FMS and chronicfatigue syndrome, with consistently positive results. 30De- spite its popularity, no controlled trials of IVMT, and onlyone trial investigating the mechanism of action of the My-ers' Cocktail 31have been conducted. A single, small-sample, open-label study of the Myers' cocktail for FMS was recentlypublished suggesting therapeutic efficacy. 32We therefore performed the first controlled clinical trial of IVMT for FMS. Methods Participants The Yale University (New Haven, CT) Human Investiga- tion Committee and Griffin Hospital (Derby, CT) Institu- tional Review Board approved the protocol. All enrolled par-ticipants provided informed consent. Eligible subjects were English-speaking between 18 and 75 years old who fulfilled the criteria for FMS, as defined bythe American College of Rheumatology, namely: (1) contin-uous presence of widespread (in all four quadrants of thebody, including axial) musculoskeletal pain of undefined eti-ology for 3 months or more, and (2) pain in 11 of 18 tenderpoint sites on digital palpation. 1 As occasion requires (PRN) use of NSAIDs and/or Cox II inhibitors was permitted provided that total dosing did notvary on average more than 50% from 1 week to the next overany given month during the past 90 days, and that no newPRN pain medication was introduced within 90 days ofstudy enrollment. All medication and supplement use wasdocumented during the screening process. Exclusion criteria included narcotic analgesic use, rheuma- tologic disease, chronic infections, untreated endocrine dis-orders, unstable seizure disorders, previously diagnosedpsychiatric disorders, acute peptic ulcer disease, congestiveheart failure, chronic liver disorders and/or bleeding diathe-sis. Pregnant women and those unwilling to stop vitaminand mineral supplementation prior to and during the courseof the study were excluded. Prescription medications for conditions unrelated to FMS were included, provided a stable dosing regimen for 60 daysprior to enrollment. A minimum of 90 days of stable dosingwas required for all classes of antidepressants and anxiolyt-ics. Other modalities of treatment specifically for FMS, such as acupuncture or osteopathy, were discontinued for 2 weeksprior to enrollment. Subjects agreed to discontinue all vita-min/mineral supplementation throughout the study period. Potential subjects exhibiting allergy to thiamine, as deter- mined by a visible wheal following intradermal injection of0.1 mL of diluted thiamine, were excluded as well as previ-ous treatment with the Myers' Cocktail. Interventions The intervention is based on the current Myers' cocktail 33 containing: 5 mL of magnesium chloride hexahydrate (20%) 3 mL calcium gluconate (10%) mL of hydroxocobalamin (1,000 /H9262g/mL) 1 mL of pyridoxine hydrochloride (100 mg/mL) 1 mL of dexpanthenol (250 mg/mL) 1 mL of B-complex 100 containing:ALI ET AL. 248/H17039100 mg of thiamine HCl, 2 mg of riboflavin, 2 mg of pyridoxine HCl, and 2 mg /H17039100 mg of niacinamide, 2% benxyl alcohol /H170395 mL of vitamin C (500 mg/mL) /H1703920 mL of sterile water. The solution is bright yellow and contains 37 mL of relativelyhigh doses of water-soluble vitamins and minerals and ster-ile water. Prior to study inception, an Investigational NewDrug (IND) application to the FDA was submitted and ap-proved (IND 66,885). Intervention solutions were prepared within 1 hour of administration, under a sterile hood, and double-checked foraccuracy by the Joint Commission on Accreditation ofHealthcare Organizations-accredited Griffin Hospital Inpa-tient Pharmacy. The placebo infusion consisted of 37 mL lac-tated Ringer's solution. Preparation costs for one dose ofIVMT was $18 US. Subjects received intervention or placebo solutions intra- venously in the antecubital fossa using a slow-push infusiondelivered over approximately 10 minutes using a 25-gaugebutterfly needle. Subjects received infusions, once weekly for8 weeks, at the Integrative Medicine Center at Griffin Hos-pital, Derby, CT. Objectives This pilot study was designed to assess safety and feasi- bility, and to provide preliminary data regarding efficacy of IVMT for FMS as compared to an intravenous lactatedRinger's placebo. Outcomes The primary outcome measure was change in the Tender Point Index (TPI) 1,34assessed by a single board-certified rheumatologist. Secondary corroborative measures includeda Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to assess global pain, the Fi- bromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ)35to assess physical function, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)36,37and Health Status Questionnaire 2.0 (HSQ 2.0)38to assess sub- jects' self-perceived mood and general well-being. Outcomes were measured at baseline, end of treatment pe- riod (8 weeks), and after a 4-week washout period (12 weeks)(Table 1). Sample size The sample size was determined to allow for 20% attrition and noncompliance and provide at least 80% power to de- tect a minimal difference of 2.0 points in the TPI between theexperimental and placebo group with a maximum allowabletype I error of 5%. A standard deviation of 2 points in theTPI was used to compute the sample size. Randomization Subjects went through a 2-week run-in period to assess the stability of FMS medication use. Those demonstrating the ability to successfully complete the run-in period (i.e.,maintain stable dosing of FMS medications) were assignedby balance allocation to either IVMT or placebo. Random-ization was performed by the data manager with genderstratification in blocks of two to assure optimal balance be-tween groups using SAS Software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).Subjects were enrolled by a study coordinator unblinded togroup allocation. Study design This pilot study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled clinical trial. Once deemed eligible, subjects were randomized to receive eight weekly intravenous lactated Ringer's solution (con-trol).IVMT (MYERS' COCKTAIL) FOR FIBROMYALGIA 249 TABLE 1.

All ten-der point examinations were performed by a single board-certified rheumatologist who was blinded to treatment as-signment. Other self-report instruments were delivered by astudy coordinator and research assistant unblinded to treat-ment assignment. Statistical methods Data were analyzed using SAS software for Windows ver- sion 9.1. Validated scoring techniques were used to calcu- late total survey scores for the BDI, HSQ, and FIQ. Responsesfor individual survey questions were scored and then addedto produce a total survey score for each study participant.The Fibromyalgia Intensity Score for each patient was cal-culated by dividing the TPI Total Survey Site Scores by 18tender-point sites tested in the survey. Individual patientreadings for the VAS were converted to scores ranging from0 to 100, based on a linear scale of 10 segments and each seg-ment 10 mm in length. Comparisons of all survey scores forthe IVMT and Placebo groups were done at three time points:baseline, 8 weeks after the start of intervention, and 12 weeksafter the start of intervention. Descriptive analyses of indi-vidual surveys showed that the data were not normally dis-tributed. Therefore, nonparametric statistics were used to an-alyze the outcomes of interest. Within-group changes in theoutcome measures were calculated by subtracting each scoreat 8 weeks and at 12 weeks from the baseline score. Differ-ences in the change in outcome measures between the twogroups were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Inall analyses, a two-tailed /H9251 of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The continuous data are presented asmeans /H11006standard deviation in the text and tables. Results Participant flow (Fig. 1) A total of 263 potential subjects were screened by phone; 55 were eligible for clinical screening. Approximately 40% of those deemed ineligible after phone screen were taking nar-cotic analgesics, while approximately 20% cited distancefrom study center or disinterest in participating. Other sub-jects were excluded due to a pre-existing health condition, alack of stability on medications, unwillingness to discontinuevitamins, or lack of FMS diagnosed by a board certifiedrheumatologist. Clinical screening consisting of TPI exami-nation was performed by a board-certified rheumatologiston 44 candidates; 35 were randomized to IVMT or placebo.Of those eligible for clinical screen, 11 were not interested incontinuing with the study, or could not be reached to sched-ule an appointment. Of the 9 that were excluded after clini-cal screen, 4 exhibited sensitivity to thiamine, and 5 werefound to be unstable on their medication (Fig. 1).

Ultimately, 31 subjects com-pleted the 8-week intervention and follow-up assessment. Recruitment Subjects were recruited by internet announcements, press releases, newspaper advertisements, presentations to FMS support groups, and mailings to rheumatologists and natur-opathic physicians between September 2003 and October2005 in south central Connecticut. Screening and data col-lection took place at Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Cen-ter in Derby, CT. Baseline data The two groups were comparable in terms of demographic and baseline characteristics (Table 2). All but 1 subject were female; 1 male was in the IVMT group. Mean ages were51.7 /H1100612.1 years and 50.7 /H110068.2 years, for the IVMT and placebo groups, respectively. Numbers analyzed Thirty-four (34) subjects enrolled and completed at least one of the two follow-up assessments: 16 in the IVMT group and 18 in the placebo group. Analyses were based on the in-tention-to-treat principle, by substituting missing valueswith the reported values from the 8-week evaluation for thesubjects who dropped out prior to completing the study. Outcomes Between-group comparisons of individual variables did not reach statistical significance (all p-values /H110220.05) (Tables 3 and 4); no significant differences were seen in participants assigned to IVMT or lactated Ringer's solution. Followingthe treatment period (8 weeks), SitesScore (intervention /H1100218.7 /H1100626.5; placebo /H1100216.6 /H1100631.2; p/H11005 (intervention/H110021.1 /H110061.4; placebo /H110020.9 /H110061.7; p/H110050.50) decreased in both groups indicating improvement in tender points. Tables 3 and 4 summarize the results for 8-week and 12- week evaluations, respectively. Ancillary analyses The within-group decreases in TPI scores was significant in the IVMT arm ( /H1100218.7 /H1100626.5, p/H110050.02 in Total Survey Site Scores and /H110021.1 /H110061.4, p/H110050.02 in the Fibromyalgia Intensity Score) as well as in the placebo arm (/H1100216.6 /H1100631.2, p/H110050.04 in Total Survey Site Scores and /H110020.9 /H110061.7, p/H110050.05 in the Fibromyalgia Intensity Score) (Table 3). At the 12-week as- sessment, TPI in Total Survey Site Scores and /H110021.0 /H110061.4, p/H110050.01 in the Fibromyalgia Intensity Score) and placebo groups (/H11002 20.7 /H1100625.4, p/H110050.01 in Total Survey Site Scores and /H110021.1 /H110061.4, p/H110050.02 in the Fibromyalgia In- tensity Score) (Table 4; Figs. 2 and 3). Significant within-group improvement was observed in mean BDI score in the IVMT group at 8 weeks (/H110024.1 /H110064.3, p/H110210.01), but not at 12 weeks of assessment (/H110023.2 /H110065.8, p/H11005 0.06). Changes in mean BDI score for the placebo group werenot statistically significant at either time point ( /H110023.2 /H110068.9, p/H110050.07 at 8 (Fig. 4). Mean within-group HSQ scores significantly increased at 8 weeks in the IVMT group (4.0 /H110065.1, p/H110050.01), but not in the placebo group (1.9 /H110067.2, p/H110050.23) (Table 3, Fig. 5). The IVMT group maintained statistically significant improve-ment in self-reported health status at 12 weeks of assessment(4.1/H110067.2, p/H110050.04), with no improvement in the placebo group (0.3 /H110065.9, p/H110050.76) (Table 4, Fig. 5). Mean VAS scores significantly decreased within-group in both arms at pain (Table 3, Fig. 6). At12 weeks, the IVMT arm reported overall sustained improve-ment in pain (/H110028.9 /H1100616.6, p/H110050.03), whereas the placebo group did not (/H110027.1 /H1100620.3, p /H110050.27) (Table 4, Fig. 6).IVMT (MYERS' COCKTAIL) FOR FIBROMYALGIA 251 TABLE 2.

At 8-week assessment, a decrease inmean FIQ scores from baseline, indicating fewer reported re-strictions on physical function, was significant in the IVMTgroup (/H1100212.0 /H1100615.3, p/H110050.02), but not in the placebo group (/H1100211.2 /H1100625.4, p/H110050.11) (Table 3, Fig. 7), though the magni- tude of change did not differ between groups. This treatmenteffect waned by 12 weeks (Table 4, Fig. 7). Adverse events One (1) subject reported feelings of dyspepsia, insomnia, depression, and a rise in blood pressure, gradually over the course of 3 weeks. The principal investigator and DataSafety Monitoring Board agreed the symptoms were un-usual given the intervention, but treated them as causal.Symptoms ameliorated after voluntary withdrawal from thestudy. No other adverse effects were reported. All subjectstolerated the infusion well, with no complaints of discom-fort or pain. Discussion This pilot study, the first controlled trial of IVMT for fi- bromyalgia, demonstrated feasibility and safety of testing an intravenous vitamin solution in a randomized, controlledtrial. All outcome measures improved at the end of the 8-week treatment period, both in intervention and placebogroups. At 12 weeks, 4 weeks after treatment had ceased,some but not all of the apparent treatment benefits hadabated. A strong placebo effect was noted, with minimal between- group differences on all outcome measures. The impact ofan invasive placebo such as weekly infusions in a health caresetting are generally greater than oral placebos. 39,40How- ever, the consistency and magnitude of treatment effects wasgreater in the IVMT group.

In comparison,only the TPI showed significant improvement at 12 weeksin the placebo group. Immediately following the treatmentperiod, the IVMT group had significantly improved pain, de-pression, and quality of life. IVMT effects persisted at 1month postintervention for pain and quality of life, but wasmarginal for depression. The suggested therapeutic effects seen in this trial are com- mensurate with other modalities considered promising. Themagnitude of change seen with IVMT with the FIQ, the stan-dard measure of global function in patients with FMS, 41ex- ceeds or is similar to the benefits seen in recently completedRCTs in both conventional and CAM domains, though theeffect sizes (Cohen's d) 42vary. Pre-post changes in the FIQ in a recent trial of patient education and exercise resulted ina 3.38-point change (d /H110050.4) in the intervention group. 43Other interventions such as written emotional disclosure re-sulted in a 5.6-point (d /H110050.5) change after 3 months; 41 acupuncture resulted in a 7.6-point ( d/H110050.7) change after 1 month.44The magnitude of change was strongest in trials of guided imagery and pramipexole with 13.2-point ( d/H110055.7) change after 6 weeks42and 13.3-point (d /H110055.7) changes af- ter 14 weeks,45respectively. A recent trial of pregabalin, the first FDA-approved drug for the treatment of fibromyalgia,found a 13.08-point (d /H110050.72) change after 14 weeks (600- mg dose).

Change from baseline in mean Tender Point Index (TPI) fibromyalgia intensity (FI) score.the benefit of Myers' Cocktail in the treatment of FMS may be derived from the magnesium content.29Magne- sium administered intravenously has been shown to ame-liorate pain in a number of conditions. 46Patients with fi- bromyalgia may be deficient in serum magnesium,47and low serum magnesium is associated with increased fatigue inFMS. 48Most other constituents of the IVMT solution have not been investigated extensively, although vitamin B 12in- jected intramuscularly has been used experimentally to treatchronic fatigue syndrome, 49which is closely associated with FMS.50 Among the limitations of this pilot study is a small sam- ple size, initially based on an effect size and variance in arandomized trial assessing the efficacy of ibuprofen for FMSpain. 51Study power may have been insufficient to identifysignificant between-group differences in light of the strongplacebo effect observed. Alternatively, if modest volume ex-pansion is a therapeutic mechanism of IVMT, the placebo inthis study may have been a poor choice, overlapping withthe active treatment. A comparison to IV insertion withoutvolume expansion and/or oral placebo may be warranted infollow-up study. The external validity of the study is limited as well, due to the homogeneous nature of the population studied. Sub-jects were primarily middle-aged white women, similar indemographics to participants in other FMS clinical trials.This is in part attributable to an increased prevalence of FMSin women compared to men. 2In addition, men with fi- bromyalgia may have less severe symptoms than womenand are less likely to seek medical care for the condition. 52ALI ET AL. 254 FIG. 5.

Conclusions In conclusion, this pilot study established the safety and feasibility of treating FMS with IVMT. No significant differ- ences in outcome measures between IVMT and placebo weredemonstrated. Preliminary data regarding the efficacy ofIVMT show a strong placebo effect, with both interventionand placebo groups experiencing strong symptomatic reliefafter 8 weeks of treatment.
