MAT is an evidence-based practice that incorporates the use of both prescription medication and counseling services to treat opioid use disorder. Reasons for addiction can be hard for some people to pinpoint, and MAT can provide patients with an opportunity to discover underlying causes of substance abuse through deep discussions with experienced counselors in group and individual therapy sessions. You can connect with other adults in large group sessions and with our therapists directly through individual counseling. Both types of therapy can provide opportunities for you to expand your support system during treatment. At Santa Ana CTC, we encourage you to take a proactive approach to recovery by getting to know others who may be facing similar struggles.
