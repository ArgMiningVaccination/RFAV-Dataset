IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS. - Life Time Digital Membership - Memberships. Your benefits of a membership to the Services (\"Life Time Digital Membership\") may be for yourself, or may be for yourself as Primary Member and any named Additional Members on your Account, whether such member configuration remains the same or is subsequently changed. The Life Time Digital Membership affords you and any Additional Member(s) general access to the Services. If you already have a Life Time Access Membership (see \"Life Time Access Membership\" below), Life Time Digital will set up your Life Time Digital Membership with the same Primary Member and the same Additional Member(s), if any. - Members. The following categories of persons are or may become members under this Agreement (collectively, the \"Members\"). - Primary Member. The initial Primary Member as designated on your Account is the primary party responsible for compliance with this Agreement (the \"Primary Member\"). You may change your status as Primary Member, including designating your Partner as Primary Member, pursuant to this Agreement. - Additional Members. The Primary Member may add or remove individual(s) as additional members (\"Additional Members\") pursuant to this Agreement on your Account. Once an Additional Member reaches a certain age or no longer meets a particular qualification as set forth in this Agreement, the Additional Member may be required to purchase his or her own Life Time Digital Membership (or Life Time Access Membership). Life Time Digital Memberships are only permitted to have one Additional Member over the age of 26. The categories of persons who are or may be identified as Additional Members under this Agreement are: - Partner Member. The Primary Member's partner may be an Additional Member (\"Partner\" or \"Partner Member\"). The Partner agrees to be jointly and severally liable for all obligations associated with the Life Time Digital Membership and may exercise the same rights as the Primary Member with respect to the Life Time Digital Membership. - Minor Members. The Primary Member is the parent, legal guardian or an authorized adult of each Additional Member who is a minor child (\"Minor Member\") and, as such, has the right and authority to make decisions concerning the care, custody and control, including the right to agree to this Agreement, with respect to and on behalf of each Minor Member. Minor Members under the age of 14 are Junior Members (\"Junior Members\"). Once a Junior Member reaches the age of 14, he or she is no longer considered a Junior Member. - Multi-Member Digital Memberships, such as a Life Time Digital 1, Life Time Digital 2, Life Time Digital 3 or Life Time Digital 4+, afford Members access to the Services based on the prevailing monthly membership dues rates required to access and use the Services. Life Time Digital 1, Life Time Digital 2, Life Time Digital 3 or Life Time Digital 4+ Multi-Member Digital Memberships reflect the number of Members over 14 who are included on the Life Time Digital Membership (e.g., Life Time Digital 2 is a membership with 2 individuals over 14 years age who are eligible to join under one Life Time Digital Membership as provided in these Terms). - Account For access to the Services, you must establish an Account with Life Time Digital. You will be required to provide us with some information about yourself and any Additional Member(s), such as your name, email address, or other contact information. - Passwords and Security. Establishing an Account for the Services may require you to create a username and a password. You agree to maintain the security, confidentiality, and integrity of your username, password, and any other security measures employed on the Services. You may not provide your password or Account credentials to any other person or use any other person's username and password or name, location or profile. You are responsible for all access to and use of the Services, including all financial transactions, under your username and password, including access or use by any Additional Member, if applicable, whether or not authorized by you. You agree to immediately notify Life Time Digital of any breach of security, including unauthorized use of your username or password, and to immediately take all reasonable steps to prevent its further occurrence, including changing your password. You further understand and agree that Life Time Digital may take actions it deems reasonably necessary to prevent, respond to, pursue or remedy suspected or actual fraud and abuse, including without limitation, termination or suspension of your Account. - Accuracy of Personal Information. You represent and warrant that all information provided to Life Time Digital is current, accurate, complete and truthful, including all initial or updated registration or membership information, such as the legal name, street address, email address, telephone number, and financial transaction account information related to you or any Additional Member(s). - Dues and/or Fees. You agree to pay the monthly dues specified when you purchased or acquired rights to your Life Time Digital Membership (plus any applicable taxes and other charges). Life Time Digital's dues, fees, costs and other charges (collectively, \"Dues and/or Fees\") are subject to change at any time in Life Time Digital's sole discretion. The amount you pay for base dues before tax (\"Base Dues\") affords the Members access to the Services only. You understand that any inability by any Member(s) to access all or any portion of the Services, including due to Life Time Digital's inability to provide access or decision to not provide access for any reason, or any change in any of the Services does not impact your obligation to pay Dues and/or Fees. In addition to other remedies, including termination, suspension or other restrictions on the Life Time Digital Membership, Life Time Digital may restrict access to the Services if any Member violates the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement(s) for additional products or services from Life Time Digital or any of its affiliates, including any failure to timely pay any amount due to Life Time Digital or any of its affiliates, including any failure to pay for your Life Time Access Membership, if any. - You agree, promise and are responsible to pay any and all financial obligations, including all Dues and/or Fees, owed to Life Time Digital with respect to the entire Life Time Digital Membership or any other services and products purchased by you or any Additional Member (collectively, \"Financial Obligations\"). - Life Time Digital maintains a listing of Dues and/or Fees online at my.lifetime.life (the \"Fee Schedule\"). You affirm you have reviewed the Fee Schedule prior to agreeing to these Terms. If you have a Life Time Access Membership that is active and in good standing, you will not be charged any Membership Dues for the Life Time Digital Membership at this time, which is subject to change at any time in Life Time Digital's sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, you understand and agree that Life Time Digital reserves the right to update the Fee Schedule at any time without notice. You agree that you remain obligated to pay the applicable Dues and/or Fees, even if such Dues and/or Fees are increased after your agreement to these Terms. - You agree to pay on the date of your enrollment in the Life Time Digital Membership any joining fees and any initial membership dues applicable to your Life Time Digital Membership. Membership dues consist of all dues applicable to the Life Time Digital Membership, including without limitation Base Dues, or other applicable dues (\"Membership Dues\" or \"Monthly Payments\"). Membership Dues are due and payable from the Monthly Payment Method (as defined below) in advance on the first of each month that this Life Time Digital Membership remains in effect. - Life Time Digital charges certain fees for failure to satisfy Financial Obligations as set forth in this Agreement, including without limitation, a late fee if you fail to timely pay Financial Obligations and an invalid payment fee if you submit an invalid payment instrument, such as a dishonored check or a declined or returned charge or debit (whether for insufficient funds or any other reason) (collectively, the \"Payment-Related Fees\"). Life Time Digital's current Payment-Related Fees may be found online on Life Time Digital's Fee Schedule at my.lifetime.life. Life Time Digital may resubmit all returned items, including declined or returned credit or debit card Transactions, multiple times in an effort to collect outstanding amounts, including during and after termination of your Life Time Digital Membership. Further, if you fail to pay any amount to Life Time Digital when due, you are responsible for all costs of collection incurred by Life Time Digital, including attorneys' fees. - Life Time Digital may assess service-related and other fees, including without limitation fees to make changes to your Life Time Digital Membership, or fees for any other separate services or products such as personal training, custom workouts, group fitness, or kids programs (collectively, the \"Service-Related Fees\"). Life Time Digital's current Service-Related Fees may be found online on Life Time Digital's Fee Schedule at my.lifetime.life or in separate agreements for the purchase of such services. - To receive individualized services such as one-on-one personal training and small group fitness classes, you must enter into a fitness services agreement and pay a separate fee. Additional information about these individualized services is available on Life Time's website at my.lifetime.life. - Payment Authorizations. You agree to pay all Financial Obligations with your Monthly Payment Method or such other payment method accepted or permitted by Life Time Digital. You authorize Life Time Digital or its agents to automatically and without notice charge or debit, as applicable, your Monthly Payment Method or such other payment method accepted or permitted by Life Time Digital to pay Financial Obligations. You understand and agree that certain of such Financial Obligations are recurring charges or debits that do not vary in amount and, as a result, no further notice is required for Life Time Digital or its agents to charge or debit such amounts to or from your Monthly Payment Method or such other payment method accepted or permitted by Life Time Digital. The payment and processing of Financial Obligations with your Monthly Payment Method or other payment method is referred to individually in this Agreement as a \"Transaction\" and collectively as \"Transactions.\" - You represent and warrant that you are an authorized account holder of any financial transaction account which you provide to Life Time Digital for payment of Membership Dues or other Transactions. - Monthly Payment Method. The credit or debit card or other financial account designated in the Account, as may be subsequently updated, is a valid financial account that may be charged or debited by Life Time Digital or its agents to pay amounts due to Life Time Digital (\"Monthly Payment Method\") as follows: - Recurring Charges. You authorize Life Time Digital or its agents on or about the first of each month (or on another date selected, as permitted by Life Time Digital) to automatically and without notice charge or debit, as applicable, your Monthly Payment Method, your Club Tab (or, if such method is invalid or inaccessible for any reason, any Club Tab Account or Other Payment Account) to pay in advance recurring Financial Obligations, including, without limitation, Membership Dues, recurring Service-Related Fees, and any and all other recurring amounts, fees, costs or other charges due to Life Time Digital. You understand and agree that such Financial Obligations are recurring charges or debits that do not vary in amount and, as a result, no further notice is required for Life Time Digital or its agents to charge or debit such amounts to or from your Monthly Payment Method. - Non-Recurring Charges. You further authorize Life Time Digital or its agents to automatically and without notice charge or debit, as applicable, your Monthly Payment Method (or, if such method is invalid or inaccessible for any reason, any Club Tab Account or Other Payment Account) to pay Financial Obligations that are non-recurring, including, without limitation, any joining fees, initial Membership Dues, Payment-Related Fees and non-recurring Service-Related Fees, and any and all other non-recurring amounts, fees, costs or other charges due to Life Time Digital. - Club Tab Account. Club Tab (\"Club Tab\") is a service pursuant to which you and any authorized Additional Members permitted by Life Time (each, a \"Member Authorized to Use Card on File\" or \"Authorized Member\") may purchase certain services or products from Life Time Digital using the credit or debit card(s) designated above or subsequently updated as the Club Tab card(s) associated with your membership (\"Club Tab Account\"). An Authorized Member may purchase services or products by presenting his or her name, membership card (if any), or telephone number at the point of sale, requesting that the Club Tab Account be used as payment method for the services or products. In consideration for using Club Tab, you certify that you are the cardholder of the Club Tab Account, you are authorized to allow charges to that card, and you authorize each Authorized Member to purchase services or products as permitted by Life Time Digital in any amount at any time using the Club Tab Account. You will pay and specifically authorize Life Time Digital or its agents to use the Club Tab Account as the payment method for purchases made by an Authorized Member until such time as your written request to revoke or terminate such authorization has been processed by Life Time Digital. You may opt-out of Club Tab at any time online at my.lifetime.life under \"Account.\" - Other Payment Accounts. If in the future Life Time Digital decides to expand or alter the acceptable forms, types or methods of payments or payment accounts (e.g., Apple Pay or PayPal) (an \"Other Payment Account\"), you understand that you may have to comply with additional rules and requirements, including recurring authorization requirements, applicable to such Other Payment Account. - Updating Payment Accounts.

With respect to Membership Dues, Life Time Digital will provide advance notice of increases in excess of 5% in a calendar year.

To the extent a third party stops making such payments, you understand that you are responsible for the full amount of Financial Obligations, including any Payment-Related Fees arising from such third party's failure to make timely payment. A third party's failure to remit payment on your behalf shall not operate as a defense to or impair your obligations to timely pay all Financial Obligations applicable to your Membership. - Unpaid Dues and/or Fees.

Unless otherwise prohibited by law, you understand and acknowledge that Life Time Digital may impose and collect a surcharge each time a Member's credit card is charged, whether in payment of Membership Dues, Service-Related Fees or any other Financial Obligations, whether recurring or non-recurring. The current surcharge is included on the Fee Schedule, as it may be updated and revised from time to time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the surcharge amount shall not be greater than Life Time Digital's actual cost of acceptance of the credit card or any applicable maximum amount, whichever is less.

This error resolution policy applies to Transactions where the applicable Club Tab is linked with an underlying debit card. - If you do NOT tell us within four (4) business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Membership number, and we can prove we could have stopped someone from using your Membership number without your permission if you had told us, you understand you could lose as much as $500. Also, if your statement from your financial institution shows Transactions using your Membership number that you did not make, you will tell us at once. If you do not tell us within 90 days after the account statement was mailed to you by your financial institution, you may not get back any money you lost after the 90 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from conducting Unauthorized Transactions if you had told us in time. For purposes of this \"Consumer Liability\" subsection, business days are Monday through Friday. Official U.S. federal holidays are not included. - Unauthorized Transaction. An \"Unauthorized Transaction\" is a type of error that occurs when money is debited from the underlying debit card associated with your Club Tab that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you. The use of your Club Tab by any Authorized Member is not an Unauthorized Transaction. If you give someone access to your Membership number or telephone number and they conduct Transactions without your knowledge or permission, you are still responsible for any resulting charges. Such Transactions are not considered Unauthorized Transactions. Unauthorized Transactions do not include disputes, claims, chargebacks, and reversals. You must contact your financial institution with regard to all disputes, claims, chargebacks and reversals. - Contact in Event of Unauthorized Club Tab Transaction. If you believe your Membership number has been lost or stolen, you will call Account Services at 1-888-430-6432. - If you do NOT tell us within four (4) business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Membership number, and we can prove we could have stopped someone from using your Membership number without your permission if you had told us, you understand you could lose as much as $500. - Term and Termination - Term.

Except as expressly provided below, Life Time Digital and you (each a \"party\" or, together, \"us,\" \"we\" or \"parties\") agree that any dispute, Claim, case, or controversy (whether based in tort, contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, equity or any other legal theory) between us (whether arising out of or relating to past, present or future acts or omissions) (\"Disputes\") shall be exclusively resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, rather than in court (\"Arbitration Agreement\"). - Waiver of Class Actions. We each agree that we will assert Disputes in arbitration only in our individual capacity, and not as a representative or member of any purported class. We each agree that we will not participate in any class, mass, collective, consolidated, private attorney general or other representative arbitration proceeding. Each party agrees that the arbitrator has no authority to arbitrate Disputes on a class-wide basis and shall not consolidate, combine, or jointly arbitrate Disputes of more than one person in a single arbitration. - Waiver of Jury Trial. We waive our constitutional and statutory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury, electing instead to resolve by binding arbitration all Disputes. - Disputes Not Subject to Arbitration. There are only three exceptions to this Arbitration Agreement: - Small Claims. Either party may bring individual Claims in small claims court. - Personal Injury Claims. Both parties must litigate personal injury Claims in court. For purposes of this exception, personal injury Claims are Claims arising from injury to the physical structure of the human body. - Emergency Equitable Relief. Either party may seek temporary injunctive relief or other equitable relief in court pending arbitration. A request for interim measures will not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement. - Arbitration Procedures. Either party may initiate an arbitration proceeding, which will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. - Arbitration Providers. Each party has a choice of initiating arbitration before either the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") or JAMS, which are both established alternative dispute resolution providers (\"ADR Providers\"). If neither AAA nor JAMS is available to arbitrate, we will agree to select an alternative ADR Provider to administer the arbitration in this Arbitration Agreement. - Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted under the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (available at www.adr.org) or JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (available at www.jamsadr.com) (\"Arbitration Rules\"). The rules of the ADR Provider will govern all aspects of the arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with this Arbitration Agreement. - Arbitration Location. The arbitration hearing will be held at the ADR Provider's location that is closest to the claimant's primary residence, unless the claimant primarily resides outside the United States (in which case the arbitrator will give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings.) - Fees. Payment of all filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the Arbitration Rules. - Arbitrator's Authority and Award. The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of the parties, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Claim. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the ADR Provider's Rules, and this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitrator will issue a written award and reasoned statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. Any award will be subject to judicial confirmation or entry in any court having jurisdiction. - Governing Law. This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law. - Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, will be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph will not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Arbitration Agreement or to enforce an arbitration award. - Additional Terms. - Liability of Third Party Purchaser. To the extent you are agreeing to and accepting this Agreement as a purchaser, payor and guarantor for a Primary Member and any Additional Member(s) (a \"Third Party Purchaser\"), you understand and agree that you are not a Member and do not have the rights afforded a Member by this Agreement, regardless of pronoun usage and syntax used throughout this Agreement.
