I was brought there as a gift from a generous relative and I consider myself very lucky. It was life-changing. The food was 95% raw vegan veggies. On rare occasions, they'd feed us cooked veggies. There's no fruit, coffee, dessert, or alcohol. In case you're not sure what vegan diets entail, that means there were also no dairy or meat products. No eggs, either. So, yes, I existed on raw vegetables for two weeks. In addition, I got massages, sessions with talk therapists, and a multitude of energy-based healing therapies I'd never heard of before. It was incredible, to say the least. Absolutely eye-opening how this lifestyle can transform my body and mind \u2014 and even my spirit! I am so inspired that I thought I needed to write about this experience so that others may find healing. This [retreat center](https://hippocratesinst.org/) claims that many people have come there with advanced health conditions that medical doctors diagnosed as a 'lost cause', but after weeks here, their conditions disappeared. Healing with Food Food is medicine. What we eat becomes our bodies. So, when we start to eat really clean foods, our bodies respond quickly. I noticed changes taking place within twenty-four hours of being there. The first thing that was obvious was my skin. It seemed to be glowing. Blemishes cleared up. Next, of course, I noticed that my body was thinner. But it wasn't just losing weight \u2014 inflammation seemed to be down. My face was different. It's like I'd had a puffy pace for years from eating foods that slightly inflamed me, that I didn't even know what I really looked like anymore. "}
