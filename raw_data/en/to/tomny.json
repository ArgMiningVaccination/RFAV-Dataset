The authors demonstrated an increase in T cell infiltration into AD cultures, which led to microglial activation and exacerbation of neurodegeneration. - [Prominent in vivo influence of single interneurons in the developing barrel cortex](/articles/s41593-023-01405-5) Spontaneous population activity bursts promote the development of brain circuits. This study shows that single GABAergic hub neurons exert a strong influence on spontaneous and sensory-evoked population bursts in the mouse barrel cortex. - [Propagation of activity through the cortical hierarchy and perception are determined by neural variability](/articles/s41593-023-01413-5) The authors reveal how the perception of optogenetic stimulation depends on the variability of background neural activity. - [High-precision mapping reveals the structure of odor coding in the human brain](/articles/s41593-023-01414-4) The authors used precision functional imaging and computational modeling to uncover the structure of perceptual odor coding in the human brain. Olfactory areas differ in the granularity, dimensionality and subjectivity of perceptual coding.

Here, the authors discuss the multiple functions of OPCs beyond their precursor cell function in the healthy and diseased CNS. - [T cell-microglia signaling exacerbates neuropathology in an Alzheimer's disease model](/articles/s41593-023-01417-1) We developed a 3D human neuroimmune axis model to study the interplay of brain innate immune cells and peripheral adaptive immune cells in Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease pathology induced a marked increase in CD8+ T cell infiltration, exacerbating neurodegeneration. The CXCL10-CXCR3 pathway has a key role in mediating this process. - [Control of social hierarchy beyond neurons](/articles/s41593-023-01392-7) Noh et al. show that the regulation of social behavior extends beyond neurons. Astrocytes, a major type of glial cell in the CNS, can influence social dominance behavior by modulating excitatory and inhibitory neural activities in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex of adult male mice. This work highlights the importance of neuron-astrocyte interplay in controlling ethologically relevant behaviors. - [How the brain plays musical statues](/articles/s41593-023-01400-w) Activating a specific subpopulation of glutamatergic neurons in the brainstem issues a motor command for global motor arrest. This motor arrest is distinct from defensive freezing and has a striking pause-and-play pattern accompanied by a reduction in respiration and heart rate. - [Five molecules work together to drive human astrocyte development](/articles/s41593-023-01391-8) Communication between diverse cell types is crucial to the development of the nervous system. However, the secreted signals that help to switch the cell fates of progenitor cells from neurogenesis to astrogenesis are not fully understood. Experiments in human tissues show that five ligands work together to push astrocyte generation and maturation. - - - - - - [In conversation with Marguerite Matthews](/articles/s41593-023-01419-z) As Nature Neuroscience celebrates its 25th anniversary, we are having conversations with both established leaders in the field and those earlier in their careers to discuss how neuroscience has evolved, and where it is heading. This month, we are talking to Marguerite Matthews, Program Director at the Office of Programs to Enhance Neuroscience Workforce Diversity at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) in the US. We spoke about how she transitioned from neuroscience research into a public service career, her work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion, and how each of us can champion these causes in our communities. - [In conversation with Richard Tsien](/articles/s41593-023-01421-5) As Nature Neuroscience celebrates its 25th anniversary, we are having conversations with both established leaders in the field and those earlier in their careers to discuss how the field has evolved and where it is heading. This month we are talking to Richard Tsien, the Druckenmiller Professor of Neuroscience in the Department of Neuroscience and Physiology at New York University Langone Medical Center. We discussed his upbringing and wide-ranging career, which has included foundational research on Ca2+ channels and synaptic plasticity. - Trending - Altmetric - The S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 crosses the blood-brain barrier in mice - Mechanisms of scent-tracking in humans - The mesencephalic locomotor region recruits V2a reticulospinal neurons in larval zebrafish - Cortical astrocytes modulate dominance behavior in male mice by regulating synaptic excitatory and inhibitory balance "}
