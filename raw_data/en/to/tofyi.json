We compose our natural products with utmost care and passion. They are distinguished by their holistic approach. All of our actions are characterised by sustainability and respectful interaction with each other and with nature. Our ancient name True to all things Weleda, our name is full of meaning. Pronounced We-lee-duh, you may hear it said a bit differently depending upon which country you're in. The beginnings of our name go back even deeper in time - way beyond 1921. The name Weleda was chosen by Dr Steiner himself to honour the ancient tradition of Celtic women healers. \"Weldas\" or \"Veledas\" were Celtic prophets and priestesses who guided others to an understanding of nature and themselves. Historical remnants of these people can still be found today in Ireland, Germany and France. Weleda became revered as a renowned title of distinction and the designation of a powerful leader and artful healer. Today, we continue our name's legacy to heal and nurture others, and it all begins with our premier skin care formulations and our homoeopathic and anthroposophic remedies.Product Training Manual Weleda Story Module Our iconic logo 3 Start a conversation about the Weleda logo and intrigued ears will soon surround you. So listen in - it's unique: Our symbolic logo was designed by Dr Steiner in 1921 to represent the act of giving and receiving, healing, integrity and social responsibility - all inherent within Weleda. The inner part of the logo is the Rod of Asclepius - an ancient symbol standing for medicine and health. The two outer segments represent protection and social interaction and encompass the interplay between giving and receiving - between you and Weleda, between you and nature and between every person in our beautiful world. It all encompasses our deep respect for and understanding of nature and humans - for you and our entire world.Product Training Manual Weleda Story Module We stand by our roots & values 4 Weleda has been making products from natural ingredients since 1921. The origins of Weleda date back to the teachings of famed philosopher and natural scientist, Dr Rudolf Steiner. He called his study of the interrelationships in our world Anthroposophy, literally \"the wisdom of humankind.\" It encourages each of us to experience our body, mind and spirit in connection with our greater world as part of one holistic system. Dr Steiner developed a personal approach to health care using ingredients from nature that holistically support the body's remarkable natural healing ability. Planting the seeds Dr Steiner developed the concept of Biodynamic\u00ae agriculture, which views a farm as a self-sustaining organism \u2014 one, complete ecosystem. Composting, fertilisation and pest control are achieved using natural farm resources. Farmers also study the natural rhythms of the sun, moon and planets for guidance on planting, crop rotation and harvesting. That's still how we cultivate our plants, herbs, flowers and fruits to this day. At Weleda, we believe beauty isn't something that's made in a lab; it's something that's cultivated carefully and lovingly right from the earth. So we keep chemicals and pesticides out of our Biodynamic\u00ae and organic gardens to protect the vitality of the plants and the environment. Because life nurtures life, all of our plants are made into tinctures or blended with other ingredients right after they're harvested. This allows the raw materials to release their nourishing properties while they are most active and aromatic. 100% pure, natural skin care When we say \"all natural,\" we mean \"ALL natural.\" We aim to use only the purest wild-crafted, organically and biodynamically cultivated ingredients for our products. Toxins, additives and raw materials from mineral oils simply won't do. Our standards are very clear: No synthetic preservatives No synthetic chemicals No GMO's No synthetic fragrances No petroleum-derived ingredients Never tested on animals Our products are certified-natural by NATRUE NATRUE is an international not-for-profit organisation made up of natural and organic cosmetic manufacturers that aims to provide guidance and reassurance to consumers around the world by offering very strict, detailed standards for certification. It has the absolute highest requirements on natural and organic ingredients used currently in natural skin care. It's completely transparent and has clear rules as to which processes and extraction methods may be used. We are proud to be a founding member of NATRUE. For more information about NATRUE go to www.natrue.orgProduct Training Manual Weleda Story Module 5 Products that work Our formulations stimulate and inspire body, soul and spirit to find your inner balance. Every product is developed with a \"lead plant,\" such as iris, wild rose, sea buckthorn and pomegranate, in accordance with specific skin types and needs. Our lead plants are discovered through our incredibly deep understanding of nature and our harmonious and symbiotic relationship with our natural world. Each lead plant has its own extraordinary healing abilities and stands as the symbol for a product line; however, it is the combination of all the natural ingredients in the formula that is responsible for the overall efficacy of a product. 90 years of respect and responsibility Since its founding, Weleda has placed great importance on ecological, social and economic responsibility. Weleda uses around 1,000 natural raw materials for its products. Roses and pomegranates from Turkey, iris and argan oil from Morocco, sesame seed oil from Mexico and lemons from Argentina and Italy are just a few examples. All around the world, Weleda promotes biodiversity and supports organic and socially sustainable cultivation projects. Fair trade We've been passionately committed to fair trade projects even before there was a popular buzzword for it. It's an organised social movement by which companies empower small producers and promote sustainability. When sourcing raw materials, Weleda works together with local partners, small-scale farming initiatives and cultivation projects around the world. In order to gather all of the ingredients we need for our products, we develop and cultivate partnerships throughout the world while committing to sustainable and fair practices. Biodynamic\u00ae cultivation The company's own Biodynamic\u00ae cultivation of medicinal plants has a long tradition. In addition to the gardens in Switzerland and France, Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd in Germany is primarily the central production site for plant extracts. Here, in the largest Medicinal Plant Garden in Europe, around 260 species are cultivated. Climate neutrality We aim for CO2-neutral transport of goods and packages. The conversion to renewable energies, environmentally friendly construction and compensation projects - for example, Dutch composting company Soil & More - contribute to reducing greenhouse emissions and optimising our ecological footprint.Product Training Manual Weleda Story Module 6100% certified natural Our quality standards aren't just high; they consistently set new benchmarks for the beauty care industry. We are actively involved in developing standards that help you make the most informed choices, and we continually devise new testing and analysis procedures to keep those standards rigorous. It's what you have come to expect from us, and it's what we expect of ourselves. NATRUE certification Weleda has earned certification from NATRUE, an international not-for-profit organisation of natural and organic cosmetic manufacturers that aims to provide guidance and reassurance to consumers around the world by offering very strict, detailed standards for certification. NATRUE follows three levels of certification, all defined as natural: 1. NATURAL COSMETICS - This level is the foundation of the NATRUE-label: it defines which ingredients are permitted and how they may be processed. Products of the other two levels need to fulfil the criteria of this level first. 2. NATURAL COSMETICS WITH ORGANIC PORTION - At least 70% of natural* ingredients must stem from controlled organic production and/or controlled wild collection. 3. ORGANIC COSMETICS - At least 95% of natural* ingredients must come from controlled organic cultivation and/or controlled wild collection. Weleda's products fall in one of these three categories, depending upon the product. We are proud to be a founding member of NATRUE. Demeter certification Demeter\u00ae is a global organisation and certifying agent for Biodynamic\u00ae farms, processors and products. Their mission is to improve the health of the planet and its people. This purist approach to farming strictly bans all chemical pesticides and growth hormones, and ensures the quality, purity and potency of our ingredients. Our entire Biodynamic\u00ae Medicinal Plant Gardens enjoy Demeter certification. Product Training Manual Weleda Story Module 7EU guidelines We produce every product according to the European Union (EU) Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practices, which regulate the quality of active ingredients and bulk goods. Our production is certified according to the EU-Eco- Regulation. All raw materials are free of GMOs, and the vast majority of the raw materials we use are from organic or Biodynamic\u00ae sources. Kosher All Weleda oral care products, including mouthwashes, toothpastes and children's tooth gels, are certified Kosher Parve, along with 52 of our skin care products. Biodynamics\u00ae from the world s freshest & most fertile farmsProduct Training Manual Weleda Story Module Biodynamics\u00ae treat a farm as a self-sustaining organism\u2014 one complete ecosystem. The soil is vibrant and alive, giving life to healthy plants. Composting, fertilisation and pest control are achieved using natural farm resources, and chemicals or growth hormones are strictly forbidden. Farmers also study the natural rhythms of the sun, moon and planets for guidance on planting, crop rotation and harvesting. All the way back in the 1920s, we set up one of the very first Biodynamic\u00ae gardens to provide us with the natural, effective raw materials we needed to make our products the way we knew they should be made. Biodynamics\u00ae not a trend, a way of life Organics aren't some newfangled trend we're jumping on. It's more like a trend we helped to establish. We set up one of the very first Biodynamic\u00ae gardens all the way back in the 1920s to provide us with the natural, effective raw materials we needed to make our products the way we knew they should be made. In these gardens, flowers thrived in the rich, balanced soil, bees buzzed from blossom to blossom, weeds were attended to with natural solutions and gardeners gently trod on the earth, nurturing every living creature. The result: the purest plants, flowers and fruits grown on earth. Remarkably, little has changed in Weleda's gardens since 90 years ago. Although, indeed, we've grown a bit since then. Today we have 135 acres of these Biodynamic\u00ae gardens in Germany\u2014the Weleda Biodynamic\u00ae Medicinal Plant Gardens are the largest of their kind in the world\u2014with more in Switzerland, France, the UK, the Netherlands, Argentina, Brazil and New Zealand, collectively growing more than 300 healing plants and flowers. That's a whole lot of Biodynamic\u00ae goodness. We believe that beauty comes from within\u2014and without. There is power in the soil that we till, the organic, Biodynamic\u00ae and wild plants that we harvest and the essential oils that we extract. So you can be assured we take excellent care of all of them. In fact, our gardens are like our babies; that's why you'll never find chemicals, pesticides or other scary things anywhere near our crops. Pure farming practices make for pure, effective Weleda products. Just the way they've always been. 8Weleda's co-founder, Dr Rudolf Steiner, developed the principles that today define Biodynamic\u00ae agriculture and the entire Weleda philosophy.Did you know?A brief history of Biodynamic\u00ae farmingProduct Training Manual Weleda Story Module In the early 20th century, farmers noticed a decline in the health of their crops and livestock. They turned to renowned philosopher, natural scientist and Weleda founder, Dr Rudolf Steiner, for help. He, in turn, created the principles that now define Biodynamic\u00ae agriculture and the entire Weleda philosophy. Dr Steiner described each farm as a complete, self- sustaining organism. The soil was \"alive,\" and if kept in balance, it had the ability to give life to healthy plants. Composting, fertilisation and pest control were to be achieved using natural farm resources, and chemicals or growth hormones were strictly forbidden. Farmers were urged to study the natural rhythms of the sun, moon and planets to provide guidance on planting, crop rotation and harvesting. In other words, take good care of your farm, and it will take good care of you too. Biodynamic\u00ae farming turned out to be a great success, yielding crops of incredible purity and potency and helping to spawn the organic movement that's so popular today. We see it as the way farming was meant to be, which is why we continue to employ its methods as we cultivate beauty around the world. 9Just like in our world and our bodies, water is often the largest single ingredient in cosmetic products. It is not counted when calculating the level of natural ingredients of a recipe.Did you know? Organics from our good earthProduct Training Manual Weleda Story Module There was a time when all agriculture was organic. But, with the advent of the Industrial Revolution and synthetic chemicals in the early 1900s, soil and plants became chemical-dependent, and their health and quality declined. Unlike conventional agriculture, organic farming works to enhance the harmony between all components of a farm. According to the Organic Trade Association (OTA), \"The primary goal of organic agriculture is to optimise the health and productivity of interdependent communities of soil life, plants, animals and people.\" Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are not allowed, nor are widespread synthetic pesticides and fertilisers that are used in conventional agriculture. 10Fresh from the wild Grown free and fresh in the wild, wild-crafted is a quality standard in which only a certain amount of a crop, in a specific area, is permitted for harvesting during a short time span in the course of a year. In this way, endangered plant species can be protected, ensuring that a balance is maintained between the needs of the earth and those of human beings. After all, happy and healthy ecosystems make for happy and healthy people. Natural from nature From bread and bananas to baby care and skin care, many products and brands tout themselves as natural. To Weleda, natural means nature-made. It comes from the ground and grows from soil. Seeds. Roots. Leaves. Stems. Flowers. Fruits. NATRUE, a third-party certifier of natural skin care products with whom Weleda has partnered, defines natural ingredients within three categories: 1. Natural ingredients are those straight from nature. They are grown from the soil and brought to life by the sun and other natural elements. 2. Derived natural ingredients are ingredients like Glycerin or Hydrolysed Beeswax that begin in nature and are transformed through a process like saponification (soap-making) to work effectively in the end product. 3. Nature-identical substances are ingredients that exist in nature but are made by humans. They are only allowed if they are minerals or work as preservatives in the product. What's more, these ingredients can only be used when they cannot be found in nature in the needed quality or quantity. Fair trade beautiful relationships, beautiful ingredientsProduct Training Manual Weleda Story Module Beautiful relationships yield beautiful ingredients. We grow dozens of acres of herbs, flowers and fruits, but it's not everything we need to cultivate beauty in the world. So we've developed partnerships that allow us to source ingredients from both small and large farms, cooperatives and cultivation projects, all while committing to sustainable, fair trade practices. Could we cultivate every ingredient we need ourselves? Perhaps. But we believe forging relationships with wonderful partners helps us do a lot of good in the world. It enables us to spread the word to other farmers about the benefits of organic and Biodynamic\u00ae principles, and help convert more lands to meet these high standards. Plus our partnerships promote the wonderful social and environmental impact of fair trade practices. It's gratifying to know that Weleda is not just creating wonderful beauty products; we're creating a climate for positive social and ecological change. That's a beautiful thing in itself. 11Fair trade is, simply, good business\u2014it's an organised social movement by which companies empower small producers and promote sustainability. In order to gather all of the ingredients we need for our products, we develop and cultivate partnerships with small and large farms, cooperatives and cultivations projects throughout the world while committing to sustainable and fair practices.Did you know?Weleda packaging Q and A sProduct Training Manual Weleda Story Module 12 What is the best way to store your products? The best way to store our products is away from direct sunlight in a tepid environment that is neither extremely cold or hot. It is also important that all products be firmly sealed after each use. We recommend that you store the products under these conditions to protect the pure nature of the formulations. Why do you use plastic bottles to package some of your products? We use recyclable and food grade PET and PE/PP plastic to package some of our products, such as baby products, body lotions and body washes to ensure safe and easy use of these products. The plastic materials are shatterproof, making them especially ideal for use in the shower and by parents for their babies. What is the shelf life of your skin care and medicine products? Our skincare products have an average shelf life of 2.5 years. Most of our medicines have a shelf life of at least 3 years. Please see our product packaging for individual product information and expiration dates. What type of packaging do you use? We employ only the safest materials for packaging to protect and preserve both the product formulation and the environment. In addition, we have designed our unique packaging for easy use and durability. We utilise three types of materials: glass, food grade PET and PE/PP (plastic) and aluminum tubes with a protective coating. All of our packaging is recyclable. Why do you use glass and aluminium tubes to package some of your products? Glass and aluminum tubes are used to package some of our premier formulations due to the pure ingredient composition of the products. Natural substances, such as essential oils, are \"living,\" making them extremely volatile. Both glass and aluminum do not react with the formulations within, eliminating oxygenation of the products. All aluminum tubes are free of nickel and are lined with a protective resin to avoid any interaction between the product and the aluminum material. Quality & ingredients Q and A sProduct Training Manual Weleda Story Module 13Why Weleda Skin Care? Each Weleda formula supports your skin's natural balance and health. Since 1921, Weleda has pioneered the use of Biodynamic\u00ae and organic ingredients in skin care and medicines to promote your natural harmony and health. Our purest ingredients\u2014natural, organic, Biodynamic\u00ae and wild crafted\u2014come directly from nature and are cultivated with the loving hands of dedicated farmers throughout the world. We create premier, naturally therapeutic skin care that captures the power and potency of nature. When you care for your skin with our soothing preparations, you will experience a vitality that only nature can bring. There are so many other German brands on the shelves now, so what differentiates Weleda from the others? Weleda was founded in Switzerland in 1921. Compared to other German and European brands we remain as THE premier natural skin care brand. A few things that make us unique are: Our 90 years of experience; we are the pioneers of natural skin care made with Biodynamic\u00ae and organic ingredients Our holistic philosophy The unparalleled quality of our ingredients; our founder, Dr Rudolf Steiner, even initiated the Biodynamic\u00ae method of agriculture in the 1920's We are the originals! Story has it that Dr Hauschka studied with Dr Steiner. He soon founded WALA, the medical division of his company, but did not create Dr Hauschka skin care for another 40-years, long after Weleda. Our products support YOUR skin's self-regulation abilities so it can balance and heal itself What is Biodynamic\u00ae agriculture? Dr Rudolf Steiner, co-founder of Weleda and the initiator of Biodynamic\u00ae agriculture, described each Biodynamic\u00ae farm as a complete, self-sustaining organism. The soil is \"alive,\" and if kept in balance, it has the ability to give life to healthy plants. Composting, fertilisation and pest control are achieved using natural farm resources, and chemicals or growth hormones are strictly forbidden. Biodynamic\u00ae farmers truly study the natural rhythms of the sun, moon and planets to provide guidance on planting, crop rotation and harvesting. The end result is vital, potent ingredients that share their healing properties with you\u2014whether you ingest them via your skin or your mouth. Quality & ingredients Q and A sProduct Training Manual Weleda Story Module 14Why aren t your products made with 100% Biodynamic\u00ae and organic ingredients? We are unable to only use Biodynamic\u00ae and organic ingredients in our products as they are not widely available and are limited in quantity. Additionally, some ingredients cannot be certified, such as inactive ingredients like glycerin. As a world's leading, natural and organic skin care company, we are occasionally unable to source the large quantity of a specific ingredients needed from Biodynamic\u00ae or organic sources. We also strive to keep our products accessible and affordable. This was part of Dr Steiner's mission. In some cases, we cannot afford to purchase specific ingredient from Biodynamic\u00ae or organic sources, as it is simply cost restrictive\u2014 without dramatically increasing our retail prices, which would be detrimental to us, and most importantly, our customers. Why is Weleda more expensive than many other brands in my natural health food store? Weleda's quality is simply unparalleled! The products are made with the most premiere Biodynamic\u00ae, organic and wild- crafted ingredients. Blended from the best in research, nature, and human wisdom and made with the utmost love and care, our products are, in fact, priceless. Are essential oils harsh on your skin? The pure essential oils we use are not harsh on your skin. We use a very small amount of essential oils to fragrance our products, and each oil is tested via gas chromatography to ensure the ingredients are in their purest form\u2014free of pesticides or any potentially irritating contaminants. Rather than harm your skin, our essential oils have a beneficial, aromatherapeutic effect on your skin and your spirit. They also help to preserve our products, which allow us to avoid using other preservatives that can have a harmful effect on your skin. What is glycerin and why do you use it? Glycerin is a threefold alcohol found in every fat. We use glycerin derived from the coconut or palm kernel oil. This ingredient is produced through the saponification process of vegetable oil and soap. It regulates the absorption and release of water, softening and smoothing the skin. Quality & ingredients Q and A sProduct Training Manual Weleda Story Module 15Why do some of your skin care and medicine products contain alcohol? Alcohol draws out the vital life forces from plants and natural substances so that, whether internally or externally via your skin, you may take in and use their alive and potent nutrients and goodness. In homoeopathic medicines and tinctures, alcohol has traditionally been used to draw out the vital life forces of a plant to create a botanical extract in a specific concentration. Throughout our 90 years of experience, we have harnessed this knowledge for both our skin care products and our remedies. Alcohol is also used as a natural preservative in our formulations. We use organic grain alcohol extracted from wheat, which is naturally derived from fermented wheat sugar. We use a very small amount of alcohol in our skin care products, so it does not have a drying effect on the skin, and we strictly do not use Methyl or Propyl alcohol\u2014also known as rubbing alcohol. Why do you use alcohol in your medicines? Traditionally, homoeopathic and herbal tinctures were made using a water and alcohol (ethanol) mixture. This stems from a time when herbs were extracted by soaking them in wine or spirits. Water and ethanol mixes are still the most common extraction method for tinctures and are now standard pharmaceutical practice. One important reason ethanol is used in the production of Weleda remedies is that ethanol is able to extract more active ingredients than other substances used for extraction, such as glycerin or water. With a wider range of active ingredients present, the end product is more effective. Another advantage of using alcohol for tinctures is that it acts as a preservative \u2014 bacteria, yeasts and moulds generally do not grow in an ethanol concentration of approximately 20% or greater. Another advantage of ethanol is that once it is ingested, it loses its preservative effect; therefore, it does not damage beneficial intestinal flora. How do you colour and fragrance your products? Our products are naturally coloured with the essential plant extracts that make up each pure formula. All formulas are naturally fragranced with essential oils and plant extracts. We do not use any synthetic colours or fragrances. What is lanolin and why use it? Lanolin is a wax derived from the wool of sheep. The process of extracting this wool does not harm the sheep in any way, as the shearing of wool is a natural and necessary process. Weleda uses the highest quality lanolin from sheep in Australia and New Zealand. It is cleaned to remove any pesticide residues. This beneficial ingredient contains natural fats that give it an affinity to the skin, making it an ideal moisturiser. We use lanolin to nourish and protect the skin. Quality & ingredients Q and A sProduct Training Manual Weleda Story Module 16How does pomegranate, one of Weleda s lead plant ingredients, regenerate the skin? Each of our ingredients are chosen to support our skin's self- regulation abilities. Our organic pomegranate seed oil and juice gives your skin antioxidant-rich vitality. The seeds are rich in punicic acid and other essential fatty acids that support your skin's natural cell renewal and regeneration. Do you use any synthetic ingredients? Never. We use only natural oils and plant extracts. All Weleda products are FREE of synthetic preservatives, fragrances, colourants and raw materials derived from mineral oils, as well as genetically modified organisms (GMO's). Our products are instead FULL of the highest quality, pure and natural ingredients for your body. What is magnesium aluminum silicate and why do you use it? Magnesium aluminum silicate (fuller's earth) is a naturally occurring mineral. Its name is the standard label applied to natural earth of various origins. Other commonly known names for this ingredient are hectorite, kaolin and white clay. This clay serves as a natural thickener commonly used to hold ingredients together, providing a moisture- binding effect. The molecules of magnesium aluminum silicate are too large to be absorbed through the skin, and it is a dermatologically well-tolerated material. This clay helps to remove impurities from the skin when used in our skincare products and it works as a gentle polisher in our toothpastes. How do you preserve your formulations? All of our premier formulations are preserved with natural ingredients. We use organic grain alcohol, natural essential oils and pure plant extracts to maintain the life of our products. Furthermore, our unique and recyclable packaging protects each formulation and helps to prevent against oxidation. As a result of these naturally effective preservation techniques, it is not necessary to refrigerate our products. All product life information can be found on the inner and outer packaging. Why do you use seed and nut oils in your products? Plants oils, derived from seeds, nuts and fruits, gently care for and nourish your skin. Unlike petroleum-based mineral oils, plant oils help support and balance your skin's moisture and oxygen levels and most closely match your skin's natural make up. Your body can easily use the fatty acids and beneficial properties within each oil to stay beautiful and healthy. Quality & ingredients Q and A sProduct Training Manual Weleda Story Module 17Can a person who is allergic to nuts use Weleda s Almond Soothing Facial Care line or other Weleda products made with almond oil? Our Almond Soothing Facial Care line is made with the refined oil, pressed from organic sweet almonds. The almond oil is heated and filtered, so the protein\u2014the allergen\u2014is removed. While the products are safe to use for someone with a nut / almond allergy, if you have a severe reaction to almonds, we suggest not using the products for your utmost mental, emotional and physical wellbeing. What is INCI? The International Nomenclature for Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) is the system we have adopted for labelling and declaring our skincare ingredients. The multilingual and multinational labelling requirements implemented by the European Union require a full declaration of ingredients on personal care packaging. This labeling standard denotes all ingredients according to their Latin (Chemical / Scientific) designation. Those manufacturers following the INCI are therefore required to label their ingredients as specified by the regulatory board. All companies selling personal care products in Europe, and most recently in Canada, are required by law to list their ingredients according to the INCI. All ingredients are listed by their quantity of presence\u2014 greatest to least\u2014in the product. Due to its full ingredient disclosure policy, the INCI standards strive to help you, the consumer, make informed and healthy purchases, helping you avoid any ingredients to which you may be allergic. What is Biodynamic\u00ae agriculture and why do you employ this cultivation method? Biodynamic\u00ae and organic farming methods are similar to one another in that they both work to enhance the soil and cultivate plants that are free of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides. Biodynamic\u00ae cultivation, however, goes a step further\u2014beyond organic. Homoeopathic preparations are used to enhance the vitality of the plants. Each plant is harvested by hand at its peak, according to the season, time of day, and position of the planets in the universe. At Weleda, we view the earth as an interconnected living organism. Plants, animals and human beings have an inherent and beautiful relationship with one another and their surroundings. Our philosophy\u2014Cultivating Beauty\u2014lies deep within the principle of Biodynamics\u00ae. Quality & ingredients Q and A sProduct Training Manual Weleda Story Module 18How are natural essential oils denoted on your packaging? According to the INCI labeling standards, all fragrances\u2014which for us represent all natural essential oils\u2014are prefaced and denoted by* (From Natural Essential Oils). According to the European Union Mediation Committee's 2005 resolution, 26 fragrances\u2014present in over 10ppm (parts per million)\u2014found to cause allergies in sensitive individuals, must be declared on all personal care ingredient listings. These fragrances are listed by their individual components according to their chemical names. As a result, Rose Oil, for instance, which contains over 400 components, many of which have not even been discovered, is no longer listed as \"Rose Oil\" on the packaging, but by its individual parts, such as \"Geraniol.\" While only 1-3% of the population has been found to have any allergy to a fragrance, this regulation has been implemented in order to inform those consumers will allergies of all ingredients that make up a product. Most often, a person is not allergic to the complete fragrance / essential oil, such as Rose Oil, but rather its components. We use all natural essential oils. By EU law, these natural ingredients are listed under the same name and designations as their synthetic counterparts, regardless of their origin. Natural essential oils\u2014particularly when blended with other essential oils, rather than in isolated form\u2014are generally well- tolerated by the skin and provide numerous physical and psychological benefits. Do you use allergy-tolerated wheat starch or gluten in your products? Gluten, the protein found in wheat and other grains, poses as an allergy concern for some people. As a natural component of wheat, it is found in some of the ingredients we use in our products. Many of our skin care products include small quantities of organic alcohol derived from organic wheat. A few products are also formulated with Triticum Vulgare (Wheat Germ) Oil. We cannot guarantee that these ingredients are entirely free of all traces of gluten. How do you test the efficacy of your products? We test the efficacy of our products through third party skin care-testing centers. We typically measure results such as increase in moisture, increase in firmness and reduction in wrinkles. We do not test our ingredients or skin care products on animals. It is unnecessary for us to do so, as the plant materials that make up our pure formulations have been used internally and externally for countless centuries. Long before animal- testing was introduced, all \"testing\" was done on humans, establishing a system of trial and error. Thus, many materials were established as safe and effective. As a result, Weleda's use of raw materials has a long history of safe usage. We ensure that our biodynamically grown ingredients and those provided by our partners have not been tested on animals.
