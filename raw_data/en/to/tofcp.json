NSU History Nova Southeastern University (NSU) is a not-for-profit, fully accredited, coeducational institution. It was founded in 1964 as Nova University of Advanced Technology. In 1974, the board of trustees changed the university's name to Nova University. In 1994, Nova University merged with Southeastern University of the Health Sciences to form Nova Southeastern University. NSU is well known for innovation and quality in both traditional and distance education. The university serves large numbers of adult students and a growing population of traditional undergraduates. To date, the institution has produced more than 162,000 alumni. Based on fall-term enrollment as a measure, Nova Southeastern University is the largest independent institution of higher education in the Southeast with nearly 26,000 students, and is the ninth largest independent institution nationally. NSU is one of 169 colleges and universities statewide and one of 29 independent four-year institutions in Florida.8 NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 The university awards associate's, bachelor's, master's, educational specialist, doctoral, and first- professional degrees in a wide range of fields, including business, counseling, computer and information sciences, education, medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, various health professions, law, marine biology, psychology, and other social sciences. The university offers 65 undergraduate majors through the Farquhar College of Arts and Sciences, the Abraham S. Fischler School of Education, the H. Wayne Huizenga School of Business and Entrepreneurship, the College of Health Care Sciences, and the College of Nursing. Nova Southeastern University has the only college of optometry in Florida and the only college of dentistry in South Florida, and had the first college of pharmacy in South Florida. The institution also enjoys an excellent reputation for its programs for families offered through the Mailman Segal Center for Human Development and University School, including innovative parenting, preschool, primary, and secondary education programs. University School of Nova Southeastern University, a fully accredited independent college preparatory day school, enrolls students in prekindergarten through 12th grade and operates from NSU's main campus in Fort Lauderdale. NSU's programs are administered through academic centers that offer courses at campuses in Fort Lauderdale, North Miami Beach, and Dania Beach as well as other locations throughout Florida, across the nation, and at selected international sites. Despite the geographic diversity of sites where classes are offered, 89 percent of the student body attends classes in Florida, and 82 percent of all students enrolled attend classes in the tricounty area (i.e., Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties). With an annual budget of approximately $570 million, Nova Southeastern University also has a significant economic impact on the surrounding community. A recent NSU study revealed that the university and its students and employees had an annual economic impact of approximately $2.6 billion on the Florida economy.Student Life NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 11 Student Life Student Affairs and the College of Undergraduate Studies Student Affairs and the College of Undergraduate Studies provides students with numerous services and cocurricular learning opportunities that are conducive to student growth, development, and engagement that lead to retention and graduation.

Referencing the Works of Another Author All academic work submitted for credit or as partial fulfillment of course requirements must adhere to each program center's specific accepted reference manuals and rules of documentation. Standards of scholarship require that the writer give proper acknowledgment when the thoughts and words of another author are used. Students must acquire a style manual approved by their center and become familiar with accepted scholarly and editorial practice in their program. Students' work must comport with the adopted citation manual for their particular center. At Nova Southeastern University, it is plagiarism to represent another person's work, words, or ideas as one's own without use of a center-recognized method of citation. Deviating from center standards (see above) are considered plagiarism at Nova Southeastern University. 3. Tendering of Information All academic work must be the original work of the student. Knowingly giving or allowing one's work to be copied, giving out exam questions or answers, or releasing or selling term papers is prohibited.26 NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 4. Acts Prohibited Students should avoid any impropriety or the appearance thereof, in taking examinations or completing work in pursuance of their educational goals. Violations of academic responsibility include, but are not limited to the following: plagiarism any form of cheating conspiracy to commit academic dishonesty misrepresentation bribery in an attempt to gain an academic advantage forging or altering documents or credentials knowingly furnishing false information to the institution Students in violation will be subjected to disciplinary action. 5. Additional Matters of Ethical Concern Where circumstances are such as to place students in positions of power over university personnel, inside or outside the institution, students should avoid any reasonable suspicion that they have used that power for personal benefit or in a capricious or arbitrary manner. B. Conduct Standards 1. Students should not interfere with the rights, safety, or health of members of the university community nor interfere with other students' right to learn. Students are expected to abide by all university, center, and program rules and regulations and all local, state, and federal laws.

The university and each center or program may prescribe additional standards for student conduct. Reasonable notice may be provided when additions or changes are made to the standards for student conduct. Students should refer to their center and/or Student Affairs Web site for policy updates or changes.28 NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 D. Violations Any violation(s) of any of the academic standards, conduct standards, or supplemental standards may result in a complaint being filed against a student to enforce the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility. Deans, associate deans, or directors may, in their discretion, immediately suspend students pending a hearing on charges of academic, conduct, or supplemental standards violations. Violations of academic, conduct, or supplemental standards are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including, expulsion from the university. Violations of academic standards will be handled through the student's academic college, school, or center. Violations of conduct or supplementary standards will be handled by the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs or by the individual academic college, school, or center as deemed appropriate. E. Sanctions If the student is found in violation of the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility and/or university policies and procedures, one or more of the following sanctions may be imposed. The following list is only illustrative. The university reserves the right to take additional disciplinary action as it deems appropriate. 1. Expulsion Permanent dismissal from the university with no right for future readmission under any circumstances. A student who has been expelled is barred from campus and/or visiting privileges. 2. Suspension Mandatory separation from the university for a period of time specified in an order of suspension. An application for readmission will not be entertained until the period of separation indicated in the suspension order has elapsed. Readmission is subject to approval of the university. During the period of suspension, the student is barred from campus visiting privileges unless specific permission is granted by the vice president of student affairs or designee, or by the student's program pursuant to its published policies and procedures. 3. Temporary Suspension Action taken by the vice president of student affairs/associate dean of student affairs, which requires a student's temporary separation from the university until a final determination is made of whether or not a student is in violation of the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility. 4.

The sanction is for the remainder of the student's career and may be reviewed by the dean of student affairs no sooner than two regular academic semesters or equivalent after the sanction is imposed. After two semesters in attendance, a student may initiate a request in writing for reduction of the sanction to disciplinary probation, but must also demonstrate reason to substantiate the request. b. Another violation of the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility will at a minimum result in suspension. 5. Disciplinary Probation A disciplinary sanction serving notice to a student that his / her behavior is in serious violation of university standards. A time period is indicated during which another violation of the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility will automatically raise the question of a more severe sanction (suspension or expulsion) if the student is found in violation. NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 29 6. Disciplinary Warning A disciplinary sanction serving notice to a student that his / her behavior has not met university standards. This sanction remains in effect for a designated number of semesters of attendance after which it is expunged from the student's file. 7. Verbal Warning A verbal warning is a verbal admonition to the student by a university staff member that his / her behavior is inappropriate. A verbal warning will be noted in the student's file for a period of time after which it is expunged from the student's file. 8. Fines Penalty fees payable to the university for violation of certain regulations with the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility. 9. Restitution Payment made for damages or losses to the university, as directed by the adjudicating body. 10.

It is considered permanent unless lifted by the vice president of student affairs / associate dean of student affairs / director of residential life or designee. 12. Counseling Intervention When extreme behavior indicates that counseling may be beneficial, the student may be referred to counseling. 13. Other Appropriate Action Disciplinary action not specifically outlined above, but approved through the vice president of student affairs / associate dean of student affairs or designee. 14. Parent / Legal Guardian Notification NSU personnel reserve the right to contact or notify a student's parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of a minor student, under 21 years of age, in writing or by phone, when alcohol or drug violations of university policy occur, or when NSU personnel determine a student's safety and/or welfare is at risk. F . Appeal Process An appeal of disciplinary action taken by the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs or its designee must be made in writing to the vice president of student affairs within 72 hours of the receipt of the written disposition of the hearing. In appealing a disciplinary decision, the appeal must fall into one of the following categories: 1. the student has new evidence that was not available prior to the original hearing 2. the disciplinary process was not adhered to during the student's hearing 3. the sanction(s) do not relate appropriately to the violation A written decision will be provided by the vice president of student affairs within a reasonable amount of time from receipt of the appeal request. The decision of the vice president of student affairs will be final. For appeals of disciplinary action taken by individual colleges, centers, or schools, please consult the academic section of this handbook related to this area and/or academic dean or designee.Specific University Policies and Procedures NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 33 Specific University Policies and Procedures Admissions Policy Please refer to the specific admission policies and procedures for each individual program center, college, or school. In general, students are provisionally admitted to a degree-seeking program based on a review of unofficial transcripts or other specific program admission requirements. However, this admission includes a condition that final and official documents and requirements must be received by Enrollment and Processing Services within 90 calendar days from the start of the term. Undergraduate students must submit all final and official documents by the last day of the drop/add period of the student's first semester. If these final and official documents and/or requirements are not received by that time, the student will not be allowed to continue class attendance. Financial aid will not be disbursed to a provisional / conditional student until he or she has been fully admitted as a regular student (all admission requirements have been approved by the college / program admission office). Alcohol Policy Nova Southeastern University, as an institution of higher education, is dedicated to the well being of all members of the university community\u2014students, faculty members, employees, and administrators. Concerned with the misuse of alcohol and other drugs (both licit and illicit), it is the policy of NSU to endeavor to prevent substance abuse through programs of education and prevention. NSU recognizes alcoholism and drug abuse as illnesses or treatable disorders, and it is NSU's policy to work with members of the NSU community to provide channels of education and assistance. However, it is the individual's responsibility to seek help. NSU also recognizes that the possession and/or use of certain substances are illegal. NSU is further obligated to comply with all local, state, and federal laws. The policy governing the use of alcohol by students at Nova Southeastern University is in compliance with the laws of the state of Florida prohibiting the consumption of alcoholic beverages by persons who are minors (under the age of 21). The policy is based on the use of alcohol in moderation and under appropriate circumstances. The university recognizes that students are adults and are expected to obey the law and take personal responsibility for their own conduct. The laws of the state of Florida prohibit the possession or consumption of alcohol by individuals less than 21 years of age. 1. The university will not authorize the use of student activity fees or other student funds collected and administered by the university to provide alcoholic beverages for any student event. 2. The sale, delivery, possession, and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages on any property owned and controlled by NSU is strictly prohibited, except as licensed by the state of Florida or otherwise permitted in these regulations. The use of alcoholic beverages on university premises shall be considered a privilege and may be allowed only if consistent with state laws and university regulations, and only when it will not interfere with the decorum and academic atmosphere of the campus. 3. Exception to this prohibition is made for university housing residents of legal drinking age. The possession and use of alcoholic beverages in university housing is governed by the Residential Living Guide. 4. The president, or an appropriate designee, may approve other exceptions to this prohibition, to allow possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages by persons of legal drinking age at designated events and locations on campus.34 NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 5. The use of alcoholic beverages off campus by students of legal drinking age is permissible. However, incidents of intoxication and/or misconduct are subject to university disciplinary action. Students are expected to comply with municipal, state, and federal laws pertaining to the possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages. Any violation of these laws may result in disciplinary action including, but not limited to, probation, suspension, or expulsion from the university. Guidelines for the Use of Alcohol at University Student Events 1. Nova Southeastern University functions, which are student oriented, may serve only beer and wine. All requests for such events must be coordinated through NSU's Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs. 2. Entry fees may be charged, but this fee is only for admission to the event, not for the sale of beer or wine. 3. One-quarter hour before the approved ending time listed on the exemption, ticket sales will stop. 4. Any advertisements for the event (including leaflets, invitations, posters, letters, and all other forms of advertisements) cannot advertise alcohol. These advertisements must display the following information: Beverages will be available. Must have valid state-issued picture identification for verification of age. 5. An adequate amount of food and alternative beverages (such as water, juice, assorted sodas, coffee, and teas) must be available throughout the duration of the event. These will be provided at the cost of the organization holding the event. The amount of food and beverages appropriate for the size of the event will be determined by the director of the student union. 6. No organization or individual may purchase beer or wine for an event. All beer and wine must be purchased and served by the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs. No other alcohol is permitted. 7. The director of student activities or designee will be present during an event at which beer and wine are served. If the director is not available, then a university employee will be designated by the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs. The organizational contact of the event must be present during the entire event as a point of contact for the director of the student union or designee. 8. The sponsoring organization is responsible for ensuring that all university policies are strictly obeyed. These guidelines do not override existing university policies, but rather, these guidelines should be used in conjunction with any and all other university policies. 9. Appropriate precautionary measures must be in place to ensure that alcoholic beverages are not served to persons under the legal drinking age. These measures include having a designated individual, as deemed by the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs, screening people entering the event and attaching a bracelet or stamp indicating those of legal drinking age. At any time during the event, the screening individual has the option to decline identification provided by an individual. The entire staff working the event has the right to refuse service to individuals deemed as having enough alcohol before or during the event. 10. Under no circumstances should anyone be coerced to drink alcohol. All drinking games, contests, or events that encourage excessive drinking are prohibited. The sponsoring organization is responsible for ensuring that all NSU policies and procedures are strictly obeyed. 11. It shall be at the discretion of the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs whether to make arrangements and pay for any security needs necessary based on the specifics of the event and the number of estimated attendees. NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 35 12. Violations of these guidelines during the event may result in the closing of the event. All individual violations will be referred to the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs for review. The university can take disciplinary actions as a result of violations of these guidelines. Abuse / Physical Assault Nova Southeastern University has expectations of the student body to resolve differences in a mature and respectful manner. Physical abuse, verbal abuse, threats, intimidations, coercion, and/or other conduct that threatens or endangers the health, safety, and/or welfare of any other member of the university community on or off campus is prohibited. Acceptance of Professional Fees The activities of students in any other profession, position, or vocation are not to be construed as the practice of medicine, optometry, pharmacy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, physician assistance, dentistry, public health, law, psychology, counseling, nursing, audiology, anesthesiology assistance, vascular sonography, and/or education. It is a violation of the law and contrary to the policy of this university for any unlicensed person to engage in the professional practice of health care, law, psychology, audiology, and/or education. Students who are appropriately licensed in a profession may engage in that profession's work to the extent provided by the law. (Students of the College of Osteopathic Medicine are required to comply with the College of Osteopathic Medicine's policy and procedure regarding professional work while enrolled.) Arson No student shall commit or aid in the intentional commission of an act that results in a fire being ignited, which causes damage, or is intended to cause damage, to the property of the university or the personal property of any member of the university community. Bomb Threats The placement of a bomb threat is an intolerable violation of university policy, which will result in expulsion from the university. Breaking and Entering The entering, or attempt to enter, any room, building, motor vehicle, or other form of property without proper authorization or consent is prohibited. Campus Security Report Nova Southeastern University, through the Public Safety Department, annually publishes the Campus Safety and Traffic Handbook, which includes security policies, procedures, practices, and statistics for offenses. Information is also available on the NSU public safety Web site at www.nova.edu/cwis/pubsafety. Cellular Phone Policy The university recognizes the growing trend regarding student possession of cellular phones and electronic devices with video, camera, or voice recording capabilities. In support of each individual's reasonable expectation of privacy, the copyright and intellectual property laws, the use of these cellular 36 NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 phone features by NSU students must be in conjunction with express consent. Students are expressly forbidden to video, use camera or voice recordings without the express consent of the subject(s) being photographed or recorded. You may not place any pictures or videos of people on a Web page without the expressed permission of the people in the pictures or videos. Any student whose use of their cellular phone violates another's reasonable expectation of privacy or produces any media as a result of the cellular phone capabilities without express consent may be found in violation of this policy. Violations of this policy may lead to disciplinary action that may result in confiscation of the cellular phone and referral to Student Affairs as a violation of the NSU Code of Student Conduct. Students are instructed to refer to their center's or college's individual program policies regarding cellular phone use and possession, because additional restrictions may apply. Closing Hours No student is permitted to enter or remain in any university building or facility, including the swimming pools, or in the academic areas of the university, after normal closing hours, unless written approval to do so has been obtained in advance from authorized university personnel. Complicity Students associated with, or present during, the commission of an act(s) by another, which constitutes a violation of university policy, may also be charged if the student's behavior constitutes permission, contributes to, or condones the violation. Computers The following five sections detail NSU policy related to the use of computers, email, and the Internet. The information is available at www.nova.edu/common-lib/policies. Acceptable Use of Computing Resources This policy provides guidelines for the appropriate and inappropriate use of the computing resources of Nova Southeastern University. It applies to all users of the university's computing resources including students, faculty and staff members, alumni, and guests of the university. Computing resources include all computers, related equipment, software, data, local area networks, and listservs for which the university is responsible as well as networks throughout the world to which the university provides computer access. The computing resources of Nova Southeastern University are intended to be used for its programs of instruction and research and to conduct the legitimate business of the university. All users must have proper authorization for the use of the university's computing resources. Users are responsible for seeing that these computing resources are used in an effective, ethical, and legal manner. Users must apply standards of normal academic and professional ethics and considerate conduct to their use of the university's computing resources. Users must be aware of the legal and moral responsibility for ethical conduct in the use of computing resources. Users have a responsibility not to abuse the network and resources, and to respect the privacy, copyrights, and intellectual property rights of others. In addition to the policy contained herein, usage must be in accordance with applicable university policies (see Related policies listed at the end of this section) and applicable state and federal laws. Among the more important laws are the Florida Computer Crimes Act, the Federal Computer Abuse Amendment Act 1994, the Federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act, and the U.S. Copyright NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 37 Act. Copies of these laws and the NSU copyright policy may be examined in the Office of Academic Affairs. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material, including unauthorized peer-to-peer file sharing, may subject the student to civil and criminal liabilities. Policy violations generally fall into five categories that involve the use of computing resources: 1. for purposes other than the university's programs of instruction and research and the legitimate business of the university 2. to harass, threaten, discriminate, stalk, intimidate, or otherwise cause harm or attempt to cause harm to specific individuals or classes of individuals 3. to impede, interfere with, impair, or otherwise cause harm to the activities of others 4. to download, post or install to university computers, or transport across university networks, material that is illegal, proprietary, in violation of license agreements, in violation of copyrights, in violation of university contracts, or otherwise damaging to the institution 5. to recklessly, willfully, negligently, or maliciously interfere with or damage NSU computer or network resources or computer data, files, or other information Examples (not a comprehensive list) of policy violations related to the above five categories include: using computer resources for personal reasons using computer resources to invade the privacy of another sending email on matters not concerning the legitimate business of the university sending an individual or group repeated and unwanted (harassing) email or using email to threaten someone accessing, or attempting to access, another individual's data or information without proper authorization (e.g. using another's computing account and password to look at their personal information) creating a false email address propagating electronic chain mail, pyramid schemes or sending forged or falsified email obtaining, possessing, using, or attempting to use someone else's password regardless of how the password was obtained copying a graphical image from a Web site without permission posting a university site-licensed program to a public bulletin board using illegally obtained licensed data / software, or using licensed data / software in violation of their licenses or purchase agreements releasing or threatening to release a virus, worm, or other program that damages or otherwise harms a system, network, or data preventing others from accessing services attempting to tamper with or obstruct the operation of NSU's computer systems or networks using or attempting to use NSU's computer systems or networks as a means for the unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or data outside the university improper peer-to-peer file sharing viewing, distributing, downloading, posting or transporting child or any pornography via the Web, including sexually explicit material for personal use that is not required for educational purposes 38 NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 using university resources for unauthorized purposes (e.g. using personal computers connected to the campus network to set up Web servers for illegal, commercial, or profit-making purposes) violating federal copyright, intellectual property, and/or trademark laws or the NSU copyright, intellectual property, and/or policy Inappropriate conduct and violations of this policy will be addressed by the appropriate procedures and agents (e.g., the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs or the Office of Human Resources) depending on the individual's affiliation to the university. In cases where a user violates any of the terms of this policy, the university may, in addition to other remedies, temporarily or permanently deny access to any and all NSU computing resources, and appropriate disciplinary actions may be taken, up to and including dismissal. Related policies that also apply to Web pages are as follows: Student-related: Student Code of Conduct and Academic Integrity Faculty-related: Faculty Policy Manual Staff-related: Employee Handbook General policies: Copyright and Patent Policy, Computing Account Security Agreement Enterprise Username and Password Policy Policy Rationale Nova Southeastern University's (NSU) network and information systems provide the technical foundation for conduct of its academic, research and administrative missions. Providing this open access to information technology is imperative to ensuring academic freedom at the institution. An important part of providing this network access is ensuring that the network and associated information is secure. The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance to faculty, staff, students, and other authorized users regarding usernames and passwords in order to protect individual and University information and resources. Adherence to this policy will help ensure that the university network and information systems are standardized, secure, and available to all. Policy Statement Usernames must be assigned to each individual user to access any NSU network. Generic usernames may only be used in circumstances where they are deemed appropriate by the Chief Information Security Officer. Passwords must meet the minimum standards set by the Chief Information Security Officer and, if possible, applications and devices providing access to technical resources must technically enforce them. Faculty, staff, vendors, and students must adhere to the standards for all systems and applications that come into contact with University technical resources. Systems That Cannot Comply with Minimum Standards If the minimum standards cannot be met, the system must be protected by other means, such as, but not limited to, a dedicated firewall, limited network access or multi-factor authentication. These mitigating controls need to be documented and forwarded to the Chief Information Security Officer for recording and audit purposes. NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 39 Remedies The University reserves the right to suspend access to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the network, systems or information periodically audit passwords for compliance pursue disciplinary action because of non-compliance Username Standards The current policy for university employees is to create the user ID from a combination of the user's first initial concatenated with their last name. If the user name already exists we add a number. Example: John Smith Username: jsmith@nova.edu (The second John Smith to be setup would be setup as jsmith1@nova.edu.) The current policy for university students is to create the user ID from a combination of the user's first name initial, last name first initial, and system generated random numerals. Example: Mary Jones Username: mj2427@nova.edu Username and Email Address Note: The university email address must be formatted the same as the username, so in the case of user John Smith with username jsmith, the resulting email address would be jsmith@nova.edu. Minimum Password Standards for User Accounts The following standards have been established by the Chief Information Security Officer. Absent a more secure password selection, the minimum baseline password standard for users and owners of systems utilized by the University is as follows: Passwords chosen must be a minimum of eight characters in length. From the following four different subsets of character classifications, pick at least one character, from at least three of the different subsets. - uppercase letter (A-Z) - lowercase letter (a-z) - digit (0-9) - special character (~`!@#$%^&*()+=_-{}[]\\|:;\"'?/<>,.) (A password example for a user account could be: one upper case character, one digit character, one special character, and five or more additional characters of your choice.) be private passwords chosen must not - contain a common proper name, login ID, email address, initials, first, middle or last name each password chosen is new and different 40 NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 Nova Southeastern University will also enforce the following system parameters to ensure more secure controls: maximum password age - 365 days minimum password age - one day (meaning that the user will not be able to change the new password they choose on their own for at least one day after the change is made) remembered passwords (History) - three (meaning that the user will not be able to use the last three passwords that they have used previous to the current password) Passwords for user accounts must be changed immediately when a user that had access to that account is no longer with NSU. Minimum Password Standards for Generic and Service Accounts The following standards have been established by the Chief Information Security Officer. Absent a more secure password selection, the minimum baseline password standard for generic user accounts and service accounts (service accounts are typically used to start services on servers and other devices) is as follows: passwords chosen must be a minimum of 15 characters in length from the following four different subsets of character classifications, pick at least one character, from at least three of the different subsets. - uppercase letter (A-Z) - lowercase letter (a-z) - digit (0-9) - special character (~`!@#$%^&*()+=_-{}[]\\|:;\"'?/<>,.) (A password example for a generic or service account could be: one upper case character, one digit character, one special character, and 12 or more additional characters of your choice.) be private passwords chosen must not - contain a common proper name, login ID, email address, initials, first, middle or last name each password chosen is new and different Nova Southeastern University will also enforce the following system parameters to ensure more secure controls: maximum password age\u2014365 days. minimum password age\u2014one day (meaning that the user will not be able to change the new password they choose on their own for at least one day after the change is made) remembered passwords (History) - three (meaning that the user will not be able to use the last three passwords that they have used previous to the current password) Passwords for generic and service accounts must be changed immediately when a user that had access to that account is no longer with NSU. NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 41 Account Lockout An account lockout policy disables a user account if an incorrect password is entered a specified number of times over a specified period. These policy settings help to prevent attackers from guessing users' passwords, and they decrease the likelihood of successful attacks on the network. Accounts that are logged into more than five times incorrectly (using the wrong username and password combination) will be locked out for a period of 15 minutes after which they will automatically be unlocked and available for use again. Security Notification If an account or password is suspected of having been compromised, report the incident to NSU IT Security at (954) 262-4643 or via email at and change the password(s) immediately. Security Auditing Password auditing may be performed on a periodic or random basis by NSU IT Security staff or its delegates. If a password is determined to be too weak during one of these scans, the user will be notified by IT Security and required to change it immediately. Pass phrases Pass phrases are not the same as passwords. A pass phrase is a longer version of a password and is, therefore, usually more secure. A pass phrase is typically composed of multiple words. Because of this, a pass phrase is usually more secure against attacks by hackers and malware. An example of a good pass phrase: \"MaryH4daL1ttleLamb!\", or the phrase \"I love to play badminton\" could become ILuv2PlayB@dm1nt()n All of the rules above that apply to passwords apply to pass phrases Access to NSU Online Systems The following policy is also available at www.nova.edu/common-lib/policies/isp.policy.html. In order to access the university's computing resources, all NSU students must provide their own Internet access service through a suitable Internet service provider. Electronic Mail Communications The following policy is also available at www.nova.edu/common-lib/policies/emailcomm.policy.html. NSU requires students and faculty and staff members to hold and maintain one official university computer account that is used to access major computing resources, including electronic mail. These university-assigned computer accounts correspond directly to NSU email addresses (see below). All official electronic mail communications directed to NSU students and faculty and staff members will be sent exclusively to NSU-assigned computer accounts to ensure timely and accurate delivery information.

Staff-related: Employee Handbook Consensual Relations Between Faculty Members and Students At Nova Southeastern University, romantic and sexual relationships between a faculty member and a student are subject to the prohibition against sexual harassment. Romantic or sexual relationships between a faculty member and a student then enrolled in the faculty member's class (including supervised student activities for which academic credit is given) may appear to be coercive, and are prohibited. Even when no coercion is present, such relationships create an appearance of impropriety and favoritism, which can impair the academic experience of all students in that class. It is, therefore, improper conduct and prohibited for a faculty member to engage in a romantic or sexual relationship with a student then enrolled in the faculty member's class. NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 43 Contracting on Behalf of the University Unless specifically authorized by the appropriate university authority, students may not contract on behalf of the university. Students who attempt to, or enter into, a contract on behalf of the university without proper authorization, are subject to disciplinary action that will result in a hold being placed on university records and transcripts until restitution is made, as well as such other sanctions as may be appropriate. Any contract entered into on behalf of the university by a student without proper authorization is void. Disabilities Nova Southeastern University complies with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. No qualified individual with a disability shall be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination in any activity, service, or program of the university solely by reason of his or her disability. Each qualified individual with a disability who meets the academic and technical standards required to enroll in and participate in Nova Southeastern University's programs shall be provided with equal access to educational programs in the most integrated setting appropriate to that person's needs through reasonable accommodation. At the postsecondary level, it is the student's responsibility to initiate the process for disability services. The process for obtaining a reasonable accommodation is an interactive one that begins with the student's disclosure of disability and a request for a reasonable accommodation. The student has the responsibility to provide Nova Southeastern University with proper documentation of disability from a qualified physician or clinician who diagnoses disabilities and sets forth the recommended accommodations. Student requests for accommodation will be considered on an individual basis. Each student with a disability should contact the Office of Student Disability Services prior to the commencement of classes to discuss his or her needs. Academic Accommodation(s) Process Requests for accommodation must be made in writing to the Office of Student Disability Services and must be supported by appropriate documentation of recent medical, psychological, or educational assessment data administered and evaluated by a qualified professional. If the student disagrees with the accommodation(s) proposed by the disability service representative in consultation with the appropriate program director and/or faculty member, he or she may appeal the decision through that center's, college's, or school's appellate process. If the issue cannot be satisfactorily resolved at the center, college, or school level, the student may appeal in writing no later than 10 days after the final decision to the university's Academic Accommodation Appellate Committee, which consists of the university's ADA coordinator or associate dean of students (if the ADA coordinator was consulted in the accommodation process) and representatives from at least four different academic centers, colleges, and/or schools. The student will be given the opportunity to present his or her appeal in an appearance before the committee. The committee will also review all relevant documents submitted with the written appeal before rendering a decision. The student will be notified in writing of the committee's decision within a reasonable amount of time of the hearing. The decision of the university's Academic Accommodation Appellate Committee is final and binding upon the student without further appeal. Academic Accommodation Appellate Committee Guidelines 1. Upon receipt of a notice of appeal, the ADA coordinator shall schedule a meeting of the committee at a time and place convenient to the student and to the committee members. 2. The student shall have the opportunity to present relevant documents for review by the committee.44 NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 3.

Facility and Grounds Accommodation(s) Process Students requesting an accommodation involving modification to a facility or the grounds of the university must meet with the ADA coordinator Arlene Gizkowski, director of the Office of Student Disability Services, (954) 262-7189, to discuss their specific needs. Requests for accommodation must be made in writing to the ADA coordinator and be supported by the appropriate documentation of recent medical, psychological, or educational assessment data administered and evaluated by a qualified professional. Requests for an accommodation involving modification to a facility or grounds of the university will be considered on an individual basis. When considering the request, the ADA coordinator will consult with the director of the specific facility (e.g., residential life and housing) involved in the request for accommodation and the director of facilities management. If the student disagrees with the facility or grounds accommodation proposed by the ADA coordinator, he or she may appeal in writing no later than 10 days after the decision to the Facility and Grounds Accommodation Appellate Committee, which consists of the university associate dean of student affairs, vice president of facilities management or his / her designee, and a disability service representative from at least three different academic centers, colleges, and/or schools.

In addition to the federal sanctions, Florida state statutes provide sanctions in regard to the use, possession, and/ or sale of illicit drugs and the abuse of alcohol. Punishment varies depending on the amount and type of drugs and/or alcohol involved. Felony convictions range from one year to life imprisonment. Possession of not more than 20 grams of cannabis is punishable as a misdemeanor of the first degree. Punishment for misdemeanors ranges from less than 60 days to one-year imprisonment. Under Sec. 893.13, Florida Statutes: It is unlawful for any person to sell, manufacture, deliver, or possess with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver a controlled substance. Violation of this statute is a felony and is punishable under Chapter 775 of the Florida Statutes.

NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 47 Failure to Comply All students and guests of NSU are expected to comply with the directives or reasonable requests of university officials acting in the performance of their duties. This requirement includes reasonable requests for students to meet appointments in administrative offices; participation in administration and/ or judicial proceedings; and the compliance by the stated deadline with all the terms and conditions of all disciplinary sanctions. Administrative discretion may be used to place a hold on a student's account (registration, grades, etc.) if the student fails to comply with the directions of a university official. False Information Providing false or misleading information to the university or a university official, or to a local, state, or national agency or official is a violation of the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility subjecting a student to disciplinary action up to and including expulsion or rescission. Falsification of Records Falsification of university records is prohibited. University records include, but are not limited to, admission, enrollment, registration, financial aid, student disciplinary, academic, health records, parking decals / hang tags and student employment records. Inappropriate conduct and violations of this policy will be addressed by the appropriate procedures and agents (e.g., the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs or the Office of Human Resources) depending on the individual's affiliation with the university. In cases where a student violates any of the terms of this policy, the university will take appropriate disciplinary actions, up to and including expulsion. Fire Safety Unnecessarily setting off a fire alarm; unnecessarily tampering with fire hoses, extinguishers, exit signs, and alarm equipment; or blocking fire exits and other means of impeding traffic may result in immediate university disciplinary action and criminal prosecution.

Students found in violation of the prohibition against gambling may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.48 NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 Grievance Procedures for Nonacademic Disputes This process should be followed for all nonacademic grievances of policies / procedures that are not governed by a specific academic center, program, college, or school. Academic grievances should be referred to the student's academic center. The purpose of these grievance procedures is to promote the orderly resolution of problems arising out of a student complaint concerning a policy, procedure, or administrative action of Nova Southeastern University. Grievances can often be adversarial, unpleasant, and unsatisfying, so we recommend that students discuss problems before resorting to the formal grievance steps. When formal grievance steps are perceived as necessary, students have a right to a fair process and hearing without retribution. 1. First, the student should attempt to resolve an issue in dispute at the level at which the dispute occurred. This attempt must be in writing (i.e., email, regular mail, or fax). The student may wish to use certified mail to verify receipt of the correspondence. In the correspondence, the student must present a rationale for his or her position based on factual information. 2. The student will receive a reply, in writing, which addresses the complaint. 3. If the reply is not acceptable, the student is encouraged to submit the complaint in writing to the associate dean of student affairs. The associate dean of student affairs will attempt to resolve the dispute. 4. If the associate dean is unable to resolve the dispute, he or she will notify the student and the vice president of student affairs in writing. 5. The student may then appeal in writing to the vice president of student affairs. 6. The vice president will investigate and review the findings, and will notify the student in writing of his or her decision. 7. The vice president's decision is final and binding and cannot be appealed. Guests Students are welcome to bring guests to the campus, but must assume responsibility for the conduct of their guests and must accompany them at all times. If a guest is asked to leave a specific area of campus, it is the responsibility of the student host to cooperate with the university official making the request. The university reserves the right to exclude all guests from any area on campus in times of impending or actual crises or emergencies, such as hurricanes, campus disruptions, or bomb threats, and to exclude any guest(s) from any area of the campus for any reason the university deems appropriate. Health Policies Communicable Diseases Guidelines It is the intent of the university to protect students from communicable diseases that pose reasonable risk of harm to members of the university community. It is also the intent of the university to protect the rights of those infected with a communicable disease. Students who do become infected with a communicable disease must report the contracting of the disease to their program dean and the associate dean of student affairs and are subject to the guidelines listed below. The university will be flexible in its response to incidents of communicable diseases, evaluating each occurrence in light of this policy and current available medical information. NSU will make available to the university community detailed information concerning the transmissibility of communicable diseases and precautions that can be taken to prevent the spread of various communicable diseases. NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 49 Infected students can continue to study and work as long as they are able to continue to perform regular responsibilities satisfactorily, and as long as the best available medical evidence indicates that their continual status does not present a health or safety threat to themselves or others. An infected student returning to school after a leave of absence for reasons related to a communicable disease must provide a statement from the treating physician indicating current medical status. Students should submit their statement to their program dean or appropriate designee based on the policies of their respective college, school, or center, and the associate dean of students. Within reason, the university will make accommodations to the infected person, whenever possible, to ensure continuity in the classroom. No infected student may be dismissed from the university solely on the basis of a diagnosis of an infection of a contagious disease. A decision to dismiss or discharge will only be made after reasonable accommodation has been attempted, and an examination of facts demonstrates that the infected person can no longer perform essential requirements of the position or program, with or without a reasonable accommodation, or poses a reasonable threat to the health and safety of others. In the event that a student has a concern about the potential for the spread of a communicable disease within the university community, those concerns should be brought to the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs for review consistent with the current available information on the spread of the particular communicable disease. After review and evaluation of the concerns, if there appears to be a reasonable likelihood of the spread of the disease within the university community by an infected person, the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs will, after notification of the issues presented to the university president, contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and/or Broward Health Department for recommendations of appropriate action consistent with state law.

Misuse of Telephones NSU students who misuse telephone lines or university accounts will be subject to disciplinary action and restitution. Noise The university noise policy is based on the belief that all students have a responsibility to respect the rights, health, security, and safety of other university and community members. Excessive noise that disturbs the campus environment, unless approved by the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs or designee for a special event, is not allowed. Students are held responsible for the actions of their guests. Off-Campus Violations The university reserves the right to take disciplinary action for violations of the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility and university policies and procedures, even when they occur off campus or through electronic communications.

Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), also known as the Buckley Amendment, affords a student certain rights with respect to his or her education records. These rights include The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day the university receives a request for access. A student should submit to the Registrar's Office a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The Registrar's Office will arrange for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. The right to request the amendment of the student's education record that the student believes is inaccurate or misleading. A student who believes that his or her education records contain information that is inaccurate or misleading, or is otherwise in violation of the student's privacy or other rights, may discuss his or her concerns informally with the University Registrar. If the decision is in agreement with the students' requests, the appropriate records will be amended. If not, the student will be notified within a reasonable period of time that the records will not be amended and will be informed by the Office of the University Registrar of his or her right to a formal hearing. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the university in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the university has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, collection agent, loan servicing agent, or the National Student Clearinghouse); a person serving on the board of trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her 56 NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 tasks. A school official has a legitimate education interest if the school official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. Upon request, the university may disclose educational records, without consent, to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll or is already enrolled, so long as the disclosure is for purposes related to the student's enrollment and transfer. The right to file a complaint with the Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW, Washington, D.C., 20202-4605 concerning alleged failures by Nova Southeastern University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. Nova Southeastern University hereby designates the following student information as public or directory information.

A student is warned, however, that some of the consequences of preventing disclosure of directory information may be undesirable: a student's name will not be published on the Dean's List or commencement bulletins, and requests from prospective employers are denied. Deceased Student Records Records of a deceased student will be made available to the parent(s), spouse, or executor/executrix of the deceased student and other authorized parties upon written request. The request must include the need for the records; must identify the requestor's relationship to the deceased student; and must be accompanied with an official record certifying authorization to receive the student records, e.g., assignment as executor/executrix. An official copy of the death certificate must accompany the request, if the university does not have prior notice of the student's death. The university reserves the right to deny the request. For further assistance on this matter, students should contact the University Registrar's Office. NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 57 Health Care Privacy (HIPAA) Statement The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\") requires \"covered entities\" to abide by the regulations governing the privacy, confidentiality, and security of protected health information, defined as individually identifiable health information created, received, maintained, or transmitted at or by a covered entity, whether such information is electronic, written, or spoken. NSU is considered a \"hybrid entity\" for purposes of compliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Regulations, as NSU's business activities include both covered and non-covered functions. As such, NSU's covered health care centers are subject to the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Regulations, as well as policies implemented by NSU. Pursuant to the HIPAA Privacy and Security Regulations, each covered NSU health care center is responsible for enacting privacy and security policies and procedures. Thus, the various NSU health care centers that provide patient care in a HIPAA-covered setting have enacted such policies and procedures. All NSU health care center workforce members including\u2014but not limited to\u2014faculty members, employees, and trainees, are responsible for following the policies and procedures implemented by the applicable NSU health care center. In addition, the HIPAA Regulations require that NSU provide training to its health care center faculty members, employees, and trainees with respect to its HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Research policies and procedures. NSU has developed a comprehensive online education program designed to comply with the HIPAA Regulations and to educate its workforce members and others who use, disclose and/or access protected health information. Applicable NSU health/mental health profession students and trainees will be required to complete the education program coordinated through his or her respective College/School/Academic Program. Violations of the NSU policies and procedures regarding privacy and security of protected health information will be reported to the appropriate supervising authority for potential disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal in accordance with the applicable College/School/Academic Program policies. Further, NSU faculty members and students may be subject to the HIPAA privacy and security policies and procedures enacted by various non-NSU health care facilities in which they train. It is the responsibility of the faculty member and student to familiarize himself or herself with such policies and procedures upon entering each facility. Any questions concerning the HIPAA privacy policies can be directed to the HIPAA Liaison of your NSU health care center, the NSU HIPAA Privacy Officer, or the NSU HIPAA Security Officer. Public Laws Students are responsible for compliance with all public laws. Any act that could constitute a violation of public laws will establish cause for legal and/or disciplinary action by the university. Sexual Misconduct and Harassment The following three sections relate to NSU policy and definitions of sexual misconduct and sexual harassment. Sexual Misconduct Policy NSU, in compliance with the spirit of various federal and state laws (e.g., Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and other similar state and federal statutes or regulations), adopts the policy and fosters an environment where no individual may threaten the health, safety, and welfare of a member of the 58 NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 university community; or any person on university property; or at a university-sponsored or -supervised activity, through the commission of a sexual assault, engaging in sexual harassment, discrimination, battery, and/or misconduct, including acquaintance rape. Definition: Sexual assault is an act of violence, aggression, and power, in which the victim, under protest or without consent, is forced to experience a sexual act through verbal coercion, threats, physical restraint, and/or physical violence. NSU acknowledges acquaintance rape in its definition of sexual assault. Acquaintance rape is defined as forced, manipulated, or coerced sexual intercourse by a friend or acquaintance. Sexual misconduct that occurs off campus can be the subject of a complaint or report and will be evaluated to determine whether or not it violates this policy. In accordance with Title IX of the Higher Education Amendments of 1972 and its implementing regulations, 34 C.F .R. part 106, both the alleged victim and the accused student shall have the right to the following: 1. Adequate, reliable, and impartial investigation of complaints including the opportunity for both parties to present witnesses and other evidence. 2. Notice of each step of the investigation and adjudication of the case, including charges presented, notice of hearing, notice of the outcome of the hearing, the right to appeal the final outcome, and notice of the outcome of the appeal. 3. Normally investigations shall take no longer that 15 class days and any subsequent adjudication of policy violations will follow immediately. In total, the entire process will be completed within 60 days. Consideration and rights to be afforded to all campus community members regarding the type of sexual assault: a. the right to have all sexual assaults against them treated with seriousness; and the right, as victims, to be treated with dignity b. the right to have sexual assaults committed against them investigated and adjudicated by the duly constituted criminal and civil authorities of the governmental entity in which the crimes occurred; and the right to the full and prompt cooperation and assistance of campus personnel in notifying the proper authorities c. the right to be free from pressure that would suggest that the victims: (i) not report crimes committed against them to civil and criminal authorities or to the campus public safety and disciplinary official; or (ii) report crimes as lesser offenses than the victims perceive them to be d. the right to be free from suggestions that sexual assault victims not report, or underreport, crimes because (i) victims are somehow responsible for the commission of crimes against them; (ii) victims were contributorially negligent or assumed the risk of being assaulted; or (iii) by reporting crimes, they would incur unwanted personal publicity e. the right to the full and prompt, reasonable cooperation from campus personnel in responding to the incident f. the right to have access to counseling services established by the university or other victim-service entities g. after campus sexual assaults have been reported, the victims of such crimes shall have the right to require that campus personnel take the necessary steps or actions reasonably feasible to prevent unwanted contact with, or proximity to, alleged assailants h. the right to be informed of disciplinary proceedings, in writing, as well as the outcome of such proceedings NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 59 i. the same right to assistance, or ability to have others present, that is afforded to the accused during any campus disciplinary proceedings Disciplinary Action: In addition to any criminal or civil actions that may be pending or in process, the university reserves the right to pursue separate disciplinary action against any individual who violates any portion of this policy through the student judicial/disciplinary process. Education and Information: The university, through the departments of the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs, residential life, recreation and wellness, and public safety, provides educational and informational programs and materials regarding awareness of rape, acquaintance rape, and other sex offenses. This information is provided through scheduled and on-demand programs. To obtain such information, contact the Office of the Associate Dean of Students. Nova Southeastern University students are encouraged to report to the police (9-911 on campus and 911 off campus), public safety (extension 28999 on campus and (954) 262-8999 off campus), and a university administrator all occurrences of sexual assault. Professional staff members in the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs, residential life, student counseling, and public safety are among those who are trained and willing to assist students who are victims of sexual assault. Students aggrieved by a violation of this policy may file a grievance under Title IX. All reports of sexual assault will be thoroughly investigated by the Title IX coordinator or the vice president of Human Resources. All of allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment of or by a student should be reported to the university Title IX coordinator, Gay Holliday, associate dean of Student Affairs, Rosenthal Building, 3301 College Avenue, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33314-7796. Call (954) 262-7281, or email gayhol@nova.edu. All reports of allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment of or by an employee, vendor, or client should be reported to Robert Pietrykowski, vice president of Human Resources, 3100 SW 9th Avenue, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33315-3025. Call (954) 262-7893, or email rpietrykowski@nova.edu. The following procedure will prevail for reports of sexual assault. Third-Party Reports: When there is a report of sexual assault, the person receiving the report whether a student, faculty member, or staff member is encouraged, in turn, to report the incident to a Title IX coordinator. If the person reporting that assault is a third party (not the victim), the administrator will do the following: a. advise the reporter to counsel the victim to seek medical assistance b. advise the reporter to encourage the victim to talk with a counselor from the Rape Center in Broward County, a staff counselor at the Henderson Student Counseling Center, a student affairs and/or residential life administrator, the director of public safety, or some other university official c. protect the confidentiality of the victim (if name is known) Victim Reports: If a student who is a victim of sexual assault reports the matter to a university administrator or any other university employee, the administrator and/or employee will encourage the victim to seek immediate medical attention and assist the victim in appropriate methods and avenues to receive medical care. In reporting a sexual assault, the victim controls the process. The administrator and/or employee will encourage the victim to authorize notification of the university Public Safety Office (PSO) of the occurrence of the crime, and then to cooperate with PSO and student life and/or residential life and housing in reporting the matter to the rape victim advocate in the state attorney's office and to local police. The victim will be assured of university support including reasonable confidentiality, full cooperation with any police investigation, and counseling through the Henderson Student Counseling Center and the Rape Crisis Center. If the victim authorizes the notification of PSO, the administrator and/or employee will inform the Title IX coordinator, which will assist as liaison with PSO.60 NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 Harassment Statement Harassment is defined as any conduct (words or acts), whether intentional or unintentional or a product of the disregard for the safety, rights, or welfare of others, which causes physical, verbal, or emotional harm; or conduct, which intimidates, degrades, demeans, threatens, hazes, or otherwise interferes with another person's rights to comfort and right to be free of a hostile environment. This includes, but is not limited to, loud or aggressive behavior; behavior that disrupts the orderly functioning of the university; disturbs the peace and/or comfort of person(s) on the campus of the university; creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment. It also includes any conduct (words or acts) in which the university can determine a threat exists to the educational process or to the health or safety of a member of the NSU community. Sexual Harassment Policy It is the intent of Nova Southeastern University to protect all employees and students from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972. Sexual harassment undermines the integrity of the employment and academic environment, debilitates morale, and interferes with the effectiveness of employees and students. At Nova Southeastern University, sexual harassment of or by employees or students includes: 1. unwelcome or unwanted sexual advances and unwelcome or unwanted conduct of a sexual nature. This includes unwelcome physical contact or sexual advances considered unacceptable by another individual. 2. requests or demands for sexual favors. This includes subtle or blatant pressures or requests for any type of sexual favor, accompanied by an implied or stated promise of preferential treatment or negative consequence concerning one's employment or academic program status. 3. verbal abuse that is sex-oriented or considered unacceptable by another individual, as well as sexually derogatory comments. This includes commenting about an individual's body or appearance when such comments go beyond mere courtesy, telling jokes that are clearly unwanted and considered offensive by others, or other tasteless sexually oriented comments, innuendoes, or actions that offend others. 4. engaging in any type of unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that is sufficiently severe or pervasive that would unreasonably interfere with another's work or deny or limit a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the school's program, services, opportunities, or activities based on sex. This includes extending unwanted sexual attention to someone that reduces personal productivity or time available to work at assigned tasks. 5. creating a work or academic program environment that is intimidating, hostile, or offensive because of unwelcome or unwanted sexually-oriented conversations, suggestions, requests, demands, physical contacts, or attentions. Nova Southeastern University will not tolerate sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is an insidious practice. It demeans individuals being treated in such a manner, and creates unacceptable stress for the entire organization. Persons harassing others will be dealt with swiftly and vigorously. Normal, non-coercive interaction that is acceptable to both parties is not considered to be sexual harassment. All allegations of sexual harassment of or by an employee, client, or vendor will be promptly and thoroughly investigated by the Office of Human Resources and should be reported promptly to the vice president of human resources. NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 61 At Nova Southeastern University, sexual harassment by employees, students, or third parties of students is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when 1. submission to such conduct is made to appear to be a term or condition of enrollment, attendance, or participation in a class 2. submission to or rejection of such conduct affects academic decisions 3. such conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive to deny or limit a student's ability to participate or benefit from the school's program, services, opportunities, or activities, or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive academic environment 4. unwelcome physical contact, including but not limited to patting, pinching, or touching 5. offensive or demeaning sexual remarks, jokes, or gestures Students aggrieved by a violation of this policy may file a grievance under their center's grievance procedure, or may report the conduct to the dean of the center, any other faculty member, or the associate vice president of human resources. The vice president of human resources or the associate dean of students Title IX coordinator must be notified immediately by the center, the dean, or faculty member upon receiving a report and/or grievance of sexual harassment. All reports of sexual harassment will be thoroughly investigated by either the associate dean of students (Title IX coordinator) or the Office of Human Resources. Any individual who violates any portion of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge for an employee and dismissal for a student. At Nova Southeastern University, romantic and sexual relationships between a faculty member and a student are subject to the prohibition against sexual harassment. Romantic or sexual relationships between a faculty member and a student then enrolled in the faculty member's class (including supervised student activities for which academic credit is given) may appear to be coercive, and are prohibited. Even when no coercion is present, such relationships create an appearance of impropriety and favoritism, which can impair the academic experience of all students in that class. It is; therefore, improper conduct and prohibited for a faculty member to engage in a romantic or sexual relationship with a student then enrolled in the faculty member's class. Solicitation and Posting Policy All on-campus sales and solicitations must be operated or sponsored by a university-recognized student organization and must receive the proper authorization. The Office of Residential Life and Housing must approve sales and solicitations in the residence halls. The following flyers are acceptable looking for a roommate selling a car, book, furniture, etc. events or information associated with NSU clubs and organizations events or information associated with NSU administrative offices or academic programs academic services and programs associated with NSUThe following flyers are not acceptable in any campus location publicity making any reference to drugs or alcohol, containing discriminatory language, or containing inappropriate photos, graphics, or language62 NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 outside vendor or company promotions outside vendor health insurance information Academic centers, colleges, schools, residence halls, and campus buildings may have their own specific solicitation and posting policies. Visit www.nova.edu/studentleadership/forms/posting_policy.pdf for more information. Stalking Any individual who willfully, knowingly, maliciously, or repeatedly follows; harasses; attempts to contact or communicate (written, verbal or electronic); and makes a credible threat placing the individual in reasonable fear of death or bodily harm may be in violation of NSU's stalking policy. Such conduct is prohibited. Stalking causes substantial emotional distress in individuals and serves no legitimate purpose. Course of conduct means a pattern of conduct composed of a series of acts over a period of time, however short, evidencing a continuity of purpose. Student Publications Nova Southeastern University, as publisher, bears the legal responsibility for the contents of student publications. In the delegation of editorial responsibility to students, the university provides sufficient editorial freedom for the student publications to maintain their integrity of purpose as vehicles of free inquiry and free expression in the Nova Southeastern University academic community. The delegated editorial freedom of student editors and managers is subject to corollary responsibilities to be governed by the canons of responsible journalism, such as the avoidance of libel; indecent, undocumented allegations; attacks on personal integrity; and the techniques of harassment and innuendo. As safeguards for the delegated editorial freedom of student publications, the following provisions are made: the student press shall be free of censorship and advance approval of copy, and its editors and managers shall be free to develop their own editorial policies and news coverage editors and managers of student publications shall be protected from arbitrary suspension and removal because of student, faculty, administrative, or public disapproval of editorial policy or content. Only for proper and stated causes shall editors and managers be subject to removal, and then by orderly and prescribed procedures all university published and financed student publications shall explicitly state on the editorial page that the opinions therein expressed are not necessarily those of Nova Southeastern University or of the student body Theft or Unauthorized Possession Students involved in the taking, sale, or possession of property without the consent of its owner or without proper remuneration may be subject to university disciplinary action and a fine, as well as arrest and prosecution by legal authorities. Title IX Compliance Policy Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, 20 USC Sections 1681 et seq., prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in schools, whether in academics or athletics. In furtherance of Title IX, Nova Southeastern University has adopted a Title IX Compliance Policy. It is the university's policy that no student enrolled at NSU shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 63 the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. The Title IX coordinator at NSU is Gay Holliday, associate dean of student affairs, who can be reached at (954) 262-7280. Students are entitled to file a grievance or complaint with the Office of the Title IX Coordinator if they perceive they have been a victim of discrimination on the basis of sex. The grievance procedure is available from the Office of the Title IX Coordinator, Rosenthal Room 112.

Smoking and tobacco use is also prohibited in all university-owned or leased vehicles, including but not limited to, public safety vehicles, physical plant vehicles, the Shark Shuttle, and golf carts. Trespass Policy Nova Southeastern University reserves the right to prohibit trespass onto its property. University employees whose duties include building or property supervision or the general safety and protection of persons or property may issue a trespass warning. A trespass warning may be issued to students or nonstudents and may apply to an individual's vehicle, as well. The revocation of a person's privilege to be on the lands, within the buildings, or on the premises of the university may be restricted to time and place by the agent of the university issuing the trespass warning. Unauthorized Entry Any student who enters, attempts to enter, or remains in any room, building, motor vehicle, trailer, or machinery without proper authorization may be subject to university disciplinary action, as well as arrest and prosecution by legal authorities.64 NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 Unauthorized Possession of University Property Students in possession of property owned or controlled by Nova Southeastern University without authorization for such property will be subject to university disciplinary action and/or restitution. In addition, students may be referred to legal authorities for prosecution. Use of University Vehicles Nova Southeastern University policy mandates that all personnel, staff, and students who either are required to or wish to use an NSU van must first successfully complete the Van Driver Training course provided by NSU Public Safety. The Public Safety Department provides as its van driver training course the most current version available, Coaching the Van Driver II, which is offered by FLI Learning Systems, Inc.

There are four types of financial aid available to assist in meeting the cost of attending college: grants, scholarships, student employment, and loans. Grants and scholarships are considered \"gift\" aid and generally do not have to be repaid. However, if a student drops or withdraws from any classes for which financial aid has been received, the student may have to return any \"unearned\" funds. Loans are considered \"self-help\" aid and always have to be repaid. Student employment requires the student to work in exchange for a pay check. Please remember that students interested in federal financial aid must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and meet general eligibility criteria. For detailed information on the financial aid process and sources of aid, visit the financial aid Web site at www.nova.edu/financialaid. Financial Aid Checklist R 1. Complete the FAFSA and NSU State Aid Application. Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at www.fafsa.gov annually. It becomes available each January 1. The earlier you apply, the better chance you have of being considered for maximum available funds. To apply for Florida grants and scholarships, undergraduate students should also complete the NSU State Aid Application available at www.nova.edu/financialaid/forms/index.html . R 2. Plan for Housing and Meal Expenses. Your budget includes a housing and meal component. Please ensure that your budget covers these expenses if you intend to live on campus. R 3. Check Your Financial Aid Account Frequently. Regularly check your financial aid status via SharkLink to ensure that you have no outstanding requirements. The link to My Financial Aid is located in the center of your SharkLink Student tab. Now is a good time to confirm your admissions status. You will have to be fully admitted in order for your financial aid funds to disburse. R 4. Submit Additional Documents and Complete a Master Promissory Note. Some students may be required to submit additional documents prior to being awarded. You will be notified of outstanding requirements via NSU (SharkLink) email. If you are interested in receiving Federal Direct Loans, you will be required to complete a Direct Loan Master Promissory Note (MPN). 72 NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 R 5. Accept, Reduce, or Decline Your Loan and Federal Work-Study Award(s). Your financial aid award notice will provide you with detailed instructions on how to accept, reduce, or decline your financial aid award. Your award will not be disbursed until this step has been completed. R 6. Don't Forget to Continually Apply for and Identify Scholarships. Schedule time regularly to search for scholarships. The best place to start is the scholarship Web page at www.nova.edu/financialaid/scholarships/. R 7. Check Your NSU (SharkLink) Email Daily. NSU (SharkLink) email and SharkLink are the official means that the OSFA will use to communicate with students. Keep up-to-date by checking your NSU email daily. R 8. Register for Classes (early). Students awarded Federal Direct Loans must be enrolled at least half time. Half-time enrollment is defined as six credits per semester for all undergraduate students. For graduate and first professional students, your program of study defines half-time status. Enrollment requirements for federal and state grants vary. Familiarize yourself with the enrollment requirements defined by your program office as well as by the financial aid programs through which you are receiving aid. Be sure to register as early as possible to ensure timely disbursement of your financial aid funds. Return of Title IV Funds Any student who does not complete at least one course within an academic semester for which financial aid is received, or could have been received, will be reviewed for a Return of Title IV Funds calculation. For complete information, please review http://www.nova.edu/financialaid/grantsloans /title_iv_return.html. Student Employment There are three main student employment programs: Federal Work-Study (FWS), Nova Student Employment (NSE), and Job Location and Development (JLD). The NSE and JLD programs provide jobs to students regardless of financial need. The FWS program is need-based and requires the completion of the FAFSA. Students awarded FWS may participate in the America Reads/ America Counts Programs through which students serve as reading or math tutors to elementary school children. For more information on NSU part-time and full-time student employment, visit www.nova.edu/financialaid/employment. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) In order to receive financial assistance, a student must continually meet four criteria of Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). According to federal regulations, effective July 1, 2011, NSU has established university-wide quantitative, qualitative, maximum time frame, and pace SAP requirements. Students who fail to meet SAP during the 2014-2015 academic year will not be eligible for Title IV federal and Florida state financial aid during the 2015-2016 academic year. Comprehensive information is available on the financial aid Web site at www.nova.edu/sap. Veterans Benefits Department of Veterans Affairs educational benefits are designated to provide eligible individuals with an opportunity for educational and career growth. Eligible veterans and their dependents should contact the Veterans Benefits Office at (954) 262-7236; toll free 800-541-6682, ext. 27236, NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 73 Monday through Friday, between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., at the William and Norma Horvitz Administration Building.

If you have any questions concerning eligibility, you may also contact the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) at 888-442-4551 or visit their Web site at www.gibill.va.gov. Standards of Progress A student receiving veterans education benefits must maintain satisfactory academic progress (SAP). Standards for SAP are published at www.nova.edu/sap. A student who, at the end of the SAP evaluation period, has not met satisfactory academic progress may file an appeal based on extenuating circumstances. With an approved appeal, a veteran student may be certified veteran education benefits on a probationary basis. If the student does not meet satisfactory academic progress by the end of the probationary period (one evaluation period), the student's veterans education benefits will be terminated. For VA payment of benefits purposes, an I (Incomplete) designation for a course must be converted to a credit grade counting toward graduation, or a failing grade, by the end of one calendar year, unless permission for a delay is granted by the academic program office and/or dean for that program. Grade/Progress Reports for Students Receiving Veterans Benefits Nova Southeastern University furnishes each student with a Notification of Posting of Grade with instructions on how to view an unofficial transcript that shows current status of grades and earned semester hours for all courses completed and/or attempted, and grades for courses in which the student is currently enrolled. At the end of every evaluation period (e.g., term, semester) each veteran can request an official transcript that shows the current status of grades and earned semester hours for all courses completed and/or attempted. This transcript can be obtained from the One-Stop Shop at the William and Norma Horvitz Administration Building or Terry Administration Building or online at https://sharklink.nova.edu/cp/home/displaylogin. Conduct Policy for Students Receiving Veterans Benefits All VA students are expected to comply with the legal and ethical standards of Nova Southeastern University. Academic dishonesty and/or nonacademic misconduct will result in disciplinary action. Specific instances of misconduct include, but are not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, knowingly furnishing false information to the institution, and forging or altering institution documents and/or academic credentials. The institution reserves the right to require a student to withdraw at any time for misconduct as described above. It also reserves the right to impose probation or suspension on a student whose conduct is determined to be unsatisfactory. Students who feel their rights have been denied are entitled to due process. Students should refer to the Appeals and Grievance Procedures listed in this student handbook. The Office of the University Bursar The Office of the University Bursar is responsible for billing students, collecting and depositing payments, issuing refunds from excess financial aid funds, and verifying students' eligibility for financial aid funds. Bursar's Office Policies By registering for courses at Nova Southeastern University, the student accepts financial responsibility for payment of all institutional costs including, but not limited to, tuition, fees, housing and meal plan (if applicable), health insurance (if applicable), and any additional costs when those charges become due.74 NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 Payment is due in full at the time of registration. NSU ebills are sent the middle of each month to the student's NSU email address. However, to avoid late charges, students should not wait for their billing statement to pay their tuition and fees. A student will not be able to register for future semesters until all outstanding balances from previous semesters have been paid in full. If a student has a balance 30 days after the start of the semester, a hold and a $100 late fee will be placed on his or her account. This hold stops all student services, including, but not limited to, access to the University RecPlex, academic credentials, and future registrations. It will remain on the student's account until the balance has been paid in full. Delinquent student account balances may be reported to a credit bureau and referred to collection agencies or litigated. Delinquent students will be liable for any costs associated with the collection of unpaid charges, including attorney fees and court costs. All registration agreements shall be construed in accordance with Florida law, and any lawsuit to collect unpaid fees may be brought in the appropriate court sitting in Broward County, Florida, regardless of the student's domicile. Methods of Payment NSU accepts Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. Check payments include traveler's checks, cashier's checks, personal checks, and money orders. International checks must be in U.S. funds only and drawn on a U.S. bank. Wire transfers are accepted. Electronic check and credit card payments can also be made through NSU eBill. Credit card authorization forms can be downloaded from the Bursar's Web site at www.nova.edu/bursar/forms /cc_authorization.pdf and faxed to (954) 262-2473. Payment Plans Some graduate program offices offer payment plan options. Please check your program's Web site for details. In addition, NSU offers the following plans: 3-Month and 10-Month Payment Plans NSU students (with the exception of international students) who wish to defer payment of their tuition, fees, and other institutional charges due at the time of registration may sign up for a 3-month or a 10-month payment plan. The 10-Month Payment Plan is available for the combined fall and winter semesters. For details, visit www.nova.edu/bursar/payment/payment_plans.html. Employer Tuition Assistance Plans Students participating in employer tuition assistance programs who wish to defer tuition payment need to submit a letter of eligibility, a purchase order from their employer, or details of the program from the employer's human resources office or the company Web site. They must also provide postdated payments (checks or credit card authorizations) for the amount of tuition. Payment of tuition only (not fees), may then be deferred for five weeks after course completion. A $75 deferment fee is charged for this service and must be paid at registration, along with all other fees. Students must notify the Office of Student Financial Assistance if they are participating in the Employer Tuition Assistance Plan. Graduate students should inquire with their program office regarding any employer tuition assistance deferment plans. NSU Student Handbook 2014-2015 75 Florida Prepaid College Plan NSU accepts and bills the Florida Prepaid College Plan for tuition, fees, and on-campus housing costs. The plans are based on the tuition rates of the tax-assisted Florida public colleges and universities. The difference between NSU tuition, fees, and on-campus housing costs and the allocations through the Florida Prepaid College Plan is the sole responsibility of the student. If a student is on the unrestricted plan, the student must designate a dollar amount for up to the cost of tuition and fees. Students new to NSU must contact Florida Prepaid at 800-552- GRAD to authorize NSU for payment.

HPD PoLiCiES AND PR oCEDuRES Acceptance of Professional Fees The activities of students are not to be construed as the practice of medicine, optometry, pharmacy, audiology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, physician assistant, anesthesiologist assistant, cardiovascular sonography, medical sonography, vascular sonography, respiratory therapy, nursing, dentistry, or public health. It is a violation of the law and contrary to the policy of this university for any unlicensed person to attempt to engage in the professional practice of health care. Students who are appropriately licensed in a profession may engage in that professional work to the extent provided by law. AiDS Policy The university has adopted the following AIDS policy: Nova Southeastern University Health Professions Division recognizes its responsibilities for the health and welfare of its students and faculty and staff members, as well as its responsibilities to patients suffering from AIDS or harboring the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). While the division does not subscribe to compulsory HIV testing either as a screening device or in individual cases, some rotation sites require this test and students must comply. As an institution of medical learning, the division provides each student knowledge to understand the AIDS problem, including AIDS testing, treatment, and counseling by community services. The division recommends universal precautions in all laboratory and clinical settings. The division reserves the right to alter this policy as new information on AIDS becomes available. Policies relating to incidents of exposure are found in Nova Southeastern University Post-Exposure Policies and Procedures.96 Health Professions Division Attendance Policy At Nova Southeastern University's Health Professions Division, attendance at all scheduled instructional periods is mandatory. Students are required to follow their college section for specific center or program policies where these policies may differ from NSU HPD policy. Failure to consider any additional requirement\u2014as set forth by the college, specific center, or program\u2014is noted in the evaluation of a student's academic performance and professional attitude and may result in a failing grade for the course. Students shall report to the individual college's Office of Student Affairs, in writing, the reasons for all absences within 24 hours of each occurrence. Students whose reasons are unacceptable will be subject to disciplinary action. In the event of an emergency absence, requests for an excused absence must be made to the individual college's Office of Student Affairs for a decision. All students are instructed to consult their specific program handbook with regard to additional or supplemental attendance policies. 1. Excused absences A. Illness: The division must be notified as soon as possible, or at the latest, on return to school, of all absences due to illness. For unusual or prolonged illness, the appropriate Office of Student Affairs must be notified as soon as possible. These absences will be evaluated on an individual basis. B. Special circumstances: Unusual circumstances resulting in absences (e.g., death in the immediate family) must be cleared with the appropriate Office of Student Affairs on an individual basis, preferably before the student is absent from class. 2. Unexcused absences Absences not falling into the first category are unexcused absences. The administration realizes that special circumstances may arise on rare occasions leading to an unexcused absence. However, unexcused absences are neither a right nor an entitlement of the student. Unexcused absences may result in a written reprimand from the dean with a copy to be placed in the student's permanent file, plus a loss of 10 percentage points in the course or failure in the course. Each laboratory, assignment, or examination missed must be made up at the discretion and convenience of the instructor. If, in the judgment of the dean, a pattern of absences appears to surface, action may be taken, up to and including failure in the courses involved or dismissal from school. 3. Clinical rotations Attendance while on clinical rotations follows different procedures and they are noted in the policy and procedures Clinical Rotation Handbook or Clerkship /Externship Manual distributed prior to going on rotations. 4. Promptness Promptness is another trait a proper health care practitioner must display. Additionally, tardiness in class disturbs both the lecturer and other members of the class and is thus markedly inconsiderate and rude. Classes begin at various times within each college. Any student not seated in his or her assigned seat by the time class begins may be marked absent. Students will await the instructor's arrival until at least 20 minutes after the specified starting time, unless notified otherwise by an Health Professions Division 97 authorized person. Class schedules are issued from time to time as an aid to faculty members and students, but the administration reserves the right to make changes, assign Saturday hours, or deviate from published schedules without notice. 5. Religious holidays Absences for major religious and ethnic holidays may be excused at the discretion of the administration. Students are required to obtain approval for their absences one week prior to the holiday. Background Checks Accepted applicants and students are required to authorize the NSU Health Professions Division to obtain background check (s) as per adopted policy of March 2011. If the background check (s) reveal information of concern, which the NSU Health Professions Division may deem unfavorable, HPD will request that the individual provide a detailed written explanation of the information contained in this report, along with appropriate documentation (e.g., police reports). Students may also be required to authorize clinical training facilities that they are assigned to by the Health Professions Division to obtain a background check with the results reported to the clinical training facility. Offers of admission will not be considered final until the completion of the background check (s), with results deemed favorable by the NSU Health Professions Division, and where appropriate, by the clinical training facilities. If information received indicates that the student has provided false or misleading statements, has omitted required information, or in any way is unable to meet the requirements for completion of the program, then the admission may be denied or rescinded, the student may be disciplined or dismissed, or his or her enrollment may be terminated. Following the initial background check (s), students will be asked annually to provide a certification relating to any convictions or guilty or no-contest pleas to any criminal offense other than traffic violations. Certificate of Physical Examination Students must have a certificate of physical examination completed by their physician. Forms will be provided to each matriculant as part of the admissions package or can be downloaded. Students may request that the University Health Service perform these examinations. The University Health Service will make appointments in as timely a manner as possible. The appointments, once made, become an obligation of the student and must be kept. These certificates (whether done privately or by the university) will be placed in an appropriate facility. Core Performance Standards for Admission and Progress The Nova Southeastern University Health Professions Division is pledged to the admission and matriculation of qualified students and wishes to acknowledge awareness of laws that prohibit discrimination against anyone on the basis of race, color, religion or creed, sex, pregnancy status, national or ethnic origin, nondisqualifying disability, age, ancestry, marital status, sexual orientation, unfavorable discharge from the military, veteran status, or political beliefs or affiliations. Regarding those students with verifiable disabilities, the university will not discriminate against such individuals who are otherwise qualified, but will expect applicants and students to meet certain 98 Health Professions Division minimal technical standards (core performance standards) as set forth herein, with or without reasonable accommodation. In adopting these standards, the university believes it must keep in mind the ultimate safety of the patients whom its graduates will eventually serve as well as the efficacy and safety in the learning environment. The standards reflect what the university believes are reasonable expectations required of health professions students and personnel in performing common functions. Any exceptions to such standards must be approved by the dean of the student's particular college based upon appropriate circumstances. The holders of health care degrees must have the knowledge and skills to function in a broad variety of clinical situations and to render a wide spectrum of patient care.

They must be able to perform palpation and functions of physical examination and/or those related to therapeutic intervention. Pharmacy students must be able to measure and compound, sometimes transferring from container to container, and to carry out sterile procedures. Dental students must be able to deliver appropriate treatment using high technology equipment such as dental drills and surgical instruments. SensoryOsteopathic students and physician assistants are required to have an enhanced ability to use their sensory skills. These enhanced tactile and proprioceptive sensory skills are essential for appropriate osteopathic evaluation and treatment of patients. Behavioral and Social Attributes Candidates and students must possess the emotional health required for full use of their intellectual abilities; the exercise of good judgment; the ability to take responsibility for their own actions with respect to policies, protocols, and process, with faculty, students, staff, patients, patient surrogates, and administration during the student's educational program; the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients; and the development of mature, sensitive, and 100 Health Professions Division effective relationships with the patients.

No open-toed shoes are to be worn in the clinics. These guidelines apply on campus from 8:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, and while on duty on rotations. Students inappropriately dressed or groomed may be requested to leave the campus. In this circumstance, an unexcused absence will be recorded until the student returns properly attired. Questionable or disputed cases of dress or grooming shall be presented to the dean, whose decision shall be final. Repeated violations will be considered improper professional behavior and may result in disciplinary action. When a class requires special dress (such as the wearing of scrub suits in anatomy laboratory or shorts in clinical skills laboratories), it will be the only exception to the dress code allowed during that time. Health Professions Division 101 The dress code is to be observed at all times including midterms and examination periods. Students are expected to consult their specific program handbooks for compliance with any program-specific, clinical rotation site-supplemental dress code policies. Food in the Lecture Halls Food and beverages are not permitted in the lecture halls, laboratories, or university clinics. identification Requirements and Fieldwork Prerequisites An affiliated clinical/ fieldwork teaching facility may also require a student to pass a state of Florida Department of Health screening before rotation. Other requirements that may be held by the affiliated facility include, but are not limited to, fingerprinting, a criminal background check, urinalysis for drugs and alcohol, and proof of immunization. If a student does not meet all requirements held by the affiliated facility before the first day of the scheduled placement, the student's placement will be canceled. If the placement has already begun, the student will be asked to leave. immunization Requirements Students must complete a mandatory immunization form, which must be signed by a licensed health care provider. The form can be found at www.nova.edu/smc/. The Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, Pharmacy, Health Care Sciences, Dental Medicine, and Nursing use the company, Certified Background, to maintain the student's immunization forms. Students in those colleges may go to www.certifiedbackground.com to upload the immunization form. The following immunizations/vaccinations are required of student at the Health Professions Division based on the current Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommendations for Health Care Personnel: Basic Immunizations: Every student is required to have had an immunization for, or show evidence of immunity to, the following diseases before matriculating at Nova Southeastern University: Varicella (Chicken Pox) One of the following is required: Proof of two vaccinations or positive antibody titer. (Lab report is required.) Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) One of the following is required: Proof of two vaccinations, or positive antibody titer for measles (rubeola), mumps, and rubella. (Lab report is Tetanus Toxoid, Diphtheria Toxoid, and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine (Tdap) All students are required to have had a Tetanus Toxoid, Diphtheria Toxoid, and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine (Tdap) booster within 10 years prior to matriculation and must maintain immunity by continuing to remain current according to the CDC recommendations for health care personnel during their program. Due to the increased risk of pertussis in a health care setting, the Advisory Committee on Immunization practices highly recommends health care workers receive a one-time Tdap (ask your health care provider). Tdap is required, without regard to interval of previous dose of Tetanus-Toxoid (Td).102 Health Professions Division Hepatitis B Both of the following are required: three vaccinations and positive surface antibody titer. (Lab report is required.) If the series is in progress, evidence of at least one shot must be provided, and the renewal date will be set accordingly. If the titer is negative or equivocal, the student must repeat the series and provide repeat titer report. PPD Skin Test (2 Step) One of the following is required: negative two-step test or negative blood test (such as QuantiFERON Gold Blood Test or T-Spot Test) or if positive PPD results, provide a chest X-ray and/or prophylactic treatment information within the past six months. Arrangements: Students may request that the Student Medical Center administer these immunizations. The Student Medical Center will make appointments in as timely a manner as possible. Students may call (954) 262-1270 to make an appointment. Once made, the appointment becomes the student's obligation and must be kept. For students at the SECs, the appointments may be scheduled with the NSU designated physician for their area. HPD fee: The HPD general access fee covers a series of three Hepatitis B vaccines and an annual PPD screening. All other immunizations and health care services are the responsibility of the student. Failure to comply: The university is not required to provide alternative sites for clinical practicum or rotations should immunization be a requirement for placement. Therefore, failure to comply with this policy may result in a student's inability to satisfy the graduation requirements in his or her program. Relative to clinical rotation site requirements, students are expected to consult their specific college/ program handbooks for compliance with any college/program specific requirements. Email Email notices to students from faculty and staff members or other students must be sent via a university assigned email address. It should be noted that forwarding (either automatic or manual forwarding) of emails containing patient/protected health information or other sensitive information to non-NSU managed email addresses is strictly prohibited and may result in disciplinary action. PHI or other sensitive information may be emailed within the University utilizing an NSU University email address when necessary to perform a job task and only if the email is accompanied by a confidentiality statement. PHI or other sensitive information may be emailed to an external recipient only if absolutely necessary and only when secured via email encryption technology and procedures as approved in advance by the NSU Chief Information Security Officer.

Absolutely no photographs or video may be taken in the anatomy laboratories. Students wishing to record lectures must obtain permission from the instructor. Consent forms may be obtained from your academic center's office. Post Exposure Policies and Procedures An occupational exposure is considered an urgent medical concern which requires immediate attention for proper medical management. An exposure that might place a student at risk for Hepatitis B Virus, Hepatitis C Virus, or HIV infection is defined as a percutaneous injury (e.g. a needle stick or cut with a sharp object) or contact of mucous membrane or non-intact skin (e.g. exposed skin that is chapped, abraded, or afflicted with dermatitis) with blood, tissue, or other body fluid that are potentially infectious. If a student has experienced such an exposure he or she must not delay in seeking medical care. If the exposure happens Monday-Friday during business hours, a student who is on the Fort Lauderdale campus is to immediately contact the Student Medical Center (8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.) at (954) 262-1270 to report such an incident or call Infection Control at (954) 262-7353 to receive appropriate care. If the student is on rotation or at a student educational center, the student must go to the nearest local emergency room for evaluation and treatment. The student also is responsible for notifying a supervisor and the Office of Risk Management as soon as possible.

Security Checks The university, the Health Professions Division, Public Safety Department /Davie Police, or community police departments may exercise the right to inspect all packages and parcels entering and leaving our premises to ensure the safety and physical integrity of the building and the premises. Please cooperate with security in providing this service and important function. Social Events and Extracurricular Activities All extracurricular activities by division-recognized organizations, on campus and off campus, must be approved in advance by that specific college's Office of Student Affairs/Office of Student Activities. A student or group of students may not officially represent the division or the university, on or off campus, at any time without prior authorization in written form. All events sponsored by student body groups must receive prior approval from the specific college's Office of Student Affairs/Office of Student Activities and faculty advisers affiliated with the group. Requests for permission for speakers, student meetings, and other activities on campus should be made on the student activities request form at least two weeks in advance. The specific college's Office of Student Affairs/Office of Student Activities must approve activities before the coordinator of educational support can assign a room, and no meeting announcements may be made until approval is received. At that time, a specific room will be assigned for the function. No announcements can be posted unless authorization is given. Student Assistance Program As a condition of enrollment in the Health Professions Division (HPD) of Nova Southeastern University (NSU), all students agree to abide by university standards concerning: 1) Drug-Free Schools and Campuses and 2) Zero Tolerance Drug Policy. The objective of the Student Assistance Program is to assist students in need of substance abuse services in order to: 1) protect the public welfare and 2) encourage those students to pursue a life of recovery so that they may regain and maintain physical and psychological health, as well as academic success within the Health Professions Division (HPD). Any student enrolled in HPD in need of substance abuse services is encouraged to voluntarily seek such assistance, with their respective college's Office of Student Affairs. The Student Assistance Program is a nondisciplinary student resource. However, in cases of suspected substance abuse, intoxication, influence or impairment, a student may be referred by their college to the Student Assistance Program in order to initiate an investigation. A Student Assistance Program investigation may include drug/alcohol screen(s), or, assessment, evaluation and/or treatment for substance abuse-related issues. All drug screen(s), assessment(s), evaluation(s), and/or treatment for substance abuse-related issues will be provided by an independent licensed health care provider(s) authorized by the Student Assistance Program. All students agree to abide by Student Assistance Program instruction and recommendation(s) as a condition of enrollment at NSU. Health Professions Division 105 A student referred to the Student Assistance Program shall sign an authorization and consent for release of information, including an authorization for the release of a student's medical records so that the Student Assistance Program director and authorized representatives of the applicable college may monitor the student's performance and compliance with the conditions of the Student Assistance Program. Any failure to comply with the conditions of the Student Assistance Program, or, failure to comply with any recommendation of an authorized independent licensed health care provider authorized by the Student Assistance Program may result in dismissal from the respective college. Any student referred to the Student Assistance Program may have his or her clinical rotations or other clinical assignments suspended or re-scheduled at sites that will allow the student to be more appropriately monitored during the course of participation in the Student Assistance Program. The student may also be asked to take a medical leave of absence from NSU while participating in the Student Assistance Program. Any act of inappropriate behavior or violation of student handbook policy by a student participating in the Student Assistance Program may be considered grounds for discipline and may result in dismissal from the respective college. A faculty member who observes a student with symptoms suggestive of intoxication, substance influence, and/or impairment may report the matter to the dean or authorized representative of his or her respective college. The Student Assistance Program is independent from the disciplinary process for each respective HPD college. Student Employment Due to the intensity of all academic programs, outside employment during regular school terms is strongly discouraged. Student insurance Requirement It is required that each Health Professions Division Student including online M.P .H. students carry adequate personal medical and hospitalization insurance. (Other online program students may not be required to submit proof of personal medical and hospitalization insurance; please check with your program office.) It is strongly suggested that students and their families avail themselves of the insurance plan obtainable through the university. Information about the policy can be obtained by accessing the Web site at www.nova.edu/studentinsurance. Please note that students will see a charge for health insurance appear on their student account as part of the academic registration process. For those students who already have health insurance coverage and do not need the NSU-endorsed insurance plan, this charge will be removed from their account once proof of coverage has been submitted by completing the online waiver. To complete the waiver form, go to www.nova.edu /insurancewaiver. The online waiver is the only process by which insurance charges will be removed and coverage will be cancelled. Students who fail to complete the waiver form and provide proof of health insurance by the stated deadline will not be eligible to have charges removed and will continue to be enrolled in the insurance plan endorsed by NSU. Waivers must be completed each academic year. In view of health care reform and the Affordable Care Act, as well as all forms of health care insurance, we wish to advise those students who have health care coverage from commercial carriers\u2014or the marketplace health care exchanges from other states than Florida\u2014to check with their carriers in order to be sure they have comprehensive health care coverage in the region of Florida where they will be attending classes or practicum rotations.106 Health Professions Division Telephone Calls A student will not be called from class for a telephone call except in cases of an emergency.

Class schedules are issued from time to time as an aid to faculty members and students, but the administration reserves the right to make changes, assign Saturday hours, or deviate from published schedules without notice. General Guidelines In general in the College of Health Care Sciences, students are graded on the basis of intellectual effort and performance, not on class attendance. It is recognized, however, that in some classes a student's grade may be based wholly or in part on class participation (e.g., laboratory sessions), and thus absences may lower the student's grade. In such cases, each course instructor will provide the course attendance policy, as well as any policy for making up missed assignments, in the course syllabus. Students are instructed to refer to their college's individual program policies/syllabi regarding attendance, as excep - tions or additional restrictions may apply.Student Responsibility for Missed Assignments It is a student's responsibility to complete all course requirements when a class is missed, but only at the convenience of the faculty member. Responsibility for materials presented in lectures, assignments, and tests/quizzes given in regularly scheduled classes lies solely with the student. Faculty Member Responsibility for Missed Assignments Faculty members are under no obligation to provide make-up quizzes/tests/exams, etc. for students who are absent from classes in which those quizzes/tests/exams are administered. Although the course instructor should exercise a fair and consistent standard for resolving questions of missed assignments, the type, extent, manner, and time frame of any make-up assignments shall be at the discretion of the instructor. College of Health Care Sciences 119 Clinical Rotations, Placements, Fieldwork, or Externship Attendance, while on clinical rotations, follows different procedures. These are noted in the policy and procedures Clinical Rotation Handbook or Fieldwork Externship Manual distributed by the program or department prior to going on rotations. Promptness Promptness is another trait a proper health care practitioner must display. Additionally, tardiness in class disturbs both the lecturer and other members of the class and is thus markedly inconsiderate and rude. University class hours are from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. daily, Monday through Friday. Class schedules are issued from time to time as an aid to faculty members and students, but the admin - istration reserves the right to make changes, assign Saturday hours, or deviate from published schedules without notice. Classes generally begin at 10 minutes after the hour unless otherwise specified by a particular department or degree program. Any student not seated in his or her assigned seat by the time class begins will be marked absent. Classes finish on the hour. If the student arrives within 20 minutes after the start of the class, the absence will be reduced to half absence. Students will await the instructor's arrival until at least 20 minutes after the specified starting time, unless notified otherwise by an authorized person. Religious Holidays Absences for major religious and ethnic holidays may be excused at the discretion of the program. Students are required to obtain approval for their absences one week prior to the holiday. Academic Advising Prior to the start of classes, each new entry-level student is assigned to a faculty adviser for academic counseling. Incoming students meet with their adviser during orientation period and are encouraged to meet periodically with their adviser to review coursework in order to avoid any academic problems. email Accounts Internet-based email is one of the primary communication methods between programs and students at NSU. All students are assigned an email account upon matriculation. Students must maintain and regularly check mail addressed to their NSU email address. NSU faculty and staff members will only use the student's NSU email address for correspondence. As a convenience to the student, it is possible to have your NSU mail forwarded to an off-campus email address by using the NSU Email Forwarding System located at www.nova.edu/commonlib/docs /emailfwd.html. Further information about email can be obtained from the NSU Help Desk at (954) 262-4357 or at www.nova.edu/help. NSU mail can be checked from any Internet browser at: http://webmail2.nova.edu. Computer Requirements and Recommendations All students are REQUIRED to have ongoing access to a computer and an active account with an Internet service provider. Information regarding the minimum recommended specifications can be accessed at https://www.nova.edu/publications/it-standards/.120 College of Health Care Sciences Internet Service Provider In order to access the university's computing resources, all Nova Southeastern University students must obtain Internet access through a suitable Internet service provider (ISP). There are many ISP providers across the country. It is the responsibility of each student to arrange for and maintain his or her Internet connection. You may choose any reliable provider of your choice. Students enrolled in online programs are recommended to access through a DSL or cable Internet connection subscription. Contact the NSU Help Desk with any questions at (954) 262-4357 or at www.nova.edu/help. Audio and Videotaping In some programs of study, students are audiotaped and/or videotaped in certain academic classes and clinical labs for teaching, learning, and/or grading purposes. Program offices will obtain authorization and releases from the student prior to any taping. Students wishing to videotape or audiotape lectures must first obtain written permission from the individual course instructor. However, absolutely no audio or videotaping is authorized during exam reviews and exams. exAmInA tIonS AnD GRADInG Policy on Returning examinations In order that they may be a learning experience, as well as a means of evaluation, all examinations will be returned or made available to the students for review in a timely manner after the examination. Grading System At the end of each course, the course director or course professor enters the grade in WebSTAR and submits a grade for each student to the office of the department chair or program director. Each program determines the method of grading using pass ( P)/fail ( F), numeric, or alpha (letter) grading scales. Grades will be issued for clinical rotations as well as didactic courses. transcript notations In all College of Health Care Sciences programs, except the undergraduate programs, failing grades will be included in calculating the GPA for the term in which the grade was received and in the cumula- tive GPA. In the College of Health Care Sciences undergraduate programs, if a student does not pass a course, the failing grade will be noted on the transcript. When the student successfully repeats the course, an E will be noted in a separate column, next to the prior failing grade, and the failing grade will then be exempt from GPA calculation. The course will then appear a second time on the transcript with the passing grade indicated followed by a notation of I in a separate column next to the passing grade, indicating this grade will be included in the calculation of the GPA. When a student passes a course by remediation examination, the minimum passing grade for that degree program will be recorded as the final grade followed by the notation E (e.g., C(E)) next to the grade on the transcript.

Such evaluations and grades are the prerogative of the instructor and are not subject to formal appeal unless there is compelling evidence of discrimination, arbitrary or capricious action, and/or procedural irregularities. Grievances and grade disputes must be in writing and directed to the course instructor within five business days prior to any retest. If unresolved, the dispute may be forwarded to the program director or department chair or designee of the chair within five business days. Failure to submit a timely appeal will be considered a waiver of the student's grade dispute appeal rights. The department chair is the final appeal for all grade disputes. Student evaluation of Courses and f aculty All courses and course instructors are subject to evaluation each time the course is offered, except courses of an individual or independent study nature (e.g., independent study courses, special research projects, theses, etc.). Students shall complete course and instructor evaluations.122 College of Health Care Sciences ACADemIC St AnDInG transcripts Each student's academic achievement is reviewed each semester and a transcript is sent to the student, the department chair or program director, the dean's office, and the financial aid office, where appli- cable. The transcript includes 1. grades earned 2. deficiencies (Incompletes, Failures, Probation, etc.) 3. semester GPA and cumulative GPA 4. honors (Chancellor's List, etc.) 5. withdrawals Course f ailures Failing any course, didactic or fieldwork, will result in the matter being referred to the department's Committee on Student Progress and may lead to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. In some programs, one or more courses may be designated as prerequisite or core competency coursework and critical for successful completion of the curriculum such that failure of a single prerequisite or core competency course may lead to dismissal. Course failures that require retakes may significantly extend the length of the program of study or require the student to withdraw from the program until the course is offered again. Students may be charged additional tuition for repeated courses. A student will only be permitted to participate in a clinical rotation experience after successful comple - tion of all required coursework up to that point. Failure to pass any of the didactic components or their remediations may lengthen the student's time in the program, delay graduation, or result in dismissal from the program. Further, a student who appeals course failures may not be allowed to begin any clinical rotation during the appeal process. Academic Withdrawal from a Course/Program A student may withdraw from a course or program of study with consultation and approval of the adviser and program director and/or department chair. A grade or notation of W will appear on the student's transcript. Students on clinical placement, rotation, or internship require prior approval from the program director and/or department chair to withdraw from placement. Withdrawal from a clinical site may significantly extend the length of the program of study. In making the request, the student understands that he or she may not be eligible to return to the program before the next academic year and may be required to meet specified conditions prior to being permitted to return to the program. The failure to meet such specified conditions may result in the student's dismissal from the program. Leave of Absence A student seeking a voluntary Leave of Absence must submit his or her request in writing to the program director and/or department chair. The dean, in collaboration with the director and/or the chair will review the written request, weigh the need for the request with the need for the student to continue in the program uninterrupted, review the student's academic standing and the length of the request, and determine whether the Leave of Absence is warranted. In collaboration with the dean, the director and/or chair will make this determination and then notify the student in writing whether a Leave of Absence will be granted and the conditions and timeframe under which the student may return to school. College of Health Care Sciences 123 Chancellor's List Students receiving a 3.8 GPA or better are placed on the Chancellor's List for that semester. A letter of commendation is sent from the chancellor to the student and the honor is recorded on the student's official transcript. Dean's List Students receiving a 3.6 GPA or better are placed on the Dean's List for that semester. A letter of commendation is sent from the dean to the student, and the honor is recorded on the student's official transcript. Graduation with Honors Students with a cumulative GPA of 3.8 or better will receive a diploma inscribed with Highest Honors. Students with a cumulative GPA of 3.6 to 3.79 will receive a diploma inscribed with Honors. Students should refer to their program-specific sections of this handbook for variations on these criteria. Committee on Student Progress Each department within the College of Health Care Sciences has a Committee on Student Progress (CSP). It is the CSP's responsibility to conduct proceedings to examine the status of students who are experiencing academic problems or who have violated any regulation, policy, and/or professional or behavioral codes of conduct. The CSP examines individual cases and makes appropriate recommendations to the department chair, who determines the final status of the individual student. All examinations of individual cases are informal proceedings conducted by the CSP . Process and Procedure When informed of the alleged violation or academic deficiency by the department chair or program director, the chair of the Committee on Student Progress, (CSP) will conduct a prelimi - nary investigation. The CSP chair will then call a meeting of the committee and shall notify the student in question. The student shall receive written notice of the time, place, and subject of the meeting. Legal representation or any other form of representation is prohibited during the hearing. If necessary, the student will provide the CSP chair with a list of any witnesses he or she may have, in writing, no less than two business days before the hearing date. The student will be responsible for ensuring the presence of his or her witness. Witnesses will be called in individually to be questioned and to provide any statements. Any witness may be asked to remain outside the meeting room for later recall. The student will not be present during the questioning of any witness. The student will be given ample opportunity to present his or her statements to the committee. The student will only be present during his or her statement and to respond to any questions from the committee. The CSP chair will dismiss the student and any witnesses and close the meeting for discussion. At the conclusion of the discussion, the committee shall make recommendations to the department chair. The department chair shall review the committee's recommendations and shall notify the student in writing by certified mail (return receipt requested), and by email with response requested.124 College of Health Care Sciences The recommendations of the CSP and all reports, letters, and investigative records shall be maintained by the department for not less than five years. This information is not part of the student's permanent record or the student's transcript. Students have the right to appeal the decision within five business days of notification from the chair of their department, except in cases of grade disputes, in which the department chair is the final appeal. A request for appeal must follow the procedures outlined in the College of Health Care Sciences Handbook section titled Student Appeals. Academic Warning/Probation/Dismissal The purpose of this policy is to identify and provide assistance to students who are not making satisfac - tory academic progress. To enhance students' chances of achieving the best academic outcomes, the College of Health Care Sciences has adopted academic standards designed to identify those students who are experiencing academic difficulty, and to provide timely intervention through academic advising and academic support programs. The policy addresses academic discipline at three levels\u2014 academic warning, academic probation, and academic dismissal. The university reserves the right to take additional action as it deems appropriate. Individual program policies may affect interpretation of these policies, and the student is therefore subject to his or her program's policies. For example, a program that dismisses students after one course failure will not need to adhere to the policies, outlined below, for Academic Probation and Academic Dismissal. Warning Academic Warning is the least severe of the three levels of academic discipline. Academic Warning will not appear on the official transcript, but will be placed in the student's program file. Academic Warning serves as an opportunity to address difficulties with the goal of preventing a student from being placed on Academic Probation. It is a written notification that any continuation of substandard academic performance may result in additional disciplinary action. An Academic Warning will be issued when a student successfully remediates a single course failure in a semester. The Academic Warning will be effective the subsequent semester and will remain in effect if the student successfully remediates another course in the same or any subsequent semester. The Academic Warning may be lifted at the end of the subsequent semester if the student successfully completes all courses without any course remediation. A student may only remediate two courses during his or her enrollment in the respective program. The issuance of an Academic Warning will result in the student being referred to his or her adviser and/or the Committee on Student Progress. Please see the Committee on Student Progress procedures in the College of Health Care Sciences section of this handbook. Probation Academic Probation is one disciplinary level higher than Academic Warning and appears on the student's official transcript. Probation serves as an opportunity to address serious academic difficulties with the goal of preventing a student from Academic Dismissal. It is a trial period during which a student has the opportunity to demonstrate that he or she can succeed academically. A student who fails any course in a program will be placed on Academic Probation. The Academic Probation may be lifted when the student successfully completes the failed course(s) the next time it is (they are) offered. College of Health Care Sciences 125 Upon being placed on Academic Probation, the student will be referred to his or her adviser and/or the Committee on Student Progress. Please see the Committee on Student Progress procedures in the College of Health Care Sciences section of this handbook. Dismissal Academic Dismissal is the final and most severe step in the levels of academic discipline. Dismissal is stipulated when students are unable to improve their academic performance and meet the conditions of their probation, as described above. A student who fails a course in a program will be referred to his or her adviser and/or the Committee on Student Progress and may be subject to dismissal from the program. Please see the Committee on Student Progress procedures in the College of Health Care Sciences section of this handbook. A student who is dismissed on the basis of inadequate academic performance may be required to reapply to the program in order to be considered for readmission under the admissions standards applicable for the next class; however, readmission is not guaranteed and is ultimately at the discretion of the program director. The applicant will be treated as a first-time competitive applicant for the purposes of coursework and must repeat and pass all required coursework. Students are instructed to refer to their college's individual program policies regarding readmission, because exceptions or additional restrictions may apply. Academic Honesty Policy and Procedure Academic dishonesty is addressed in the university-wide section of this student handbook, under NSU Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility, Student Rights and Responsibilities, as defined under Academic Standards. The following policy and procedure applies specifically to the College of Health Care Sciences as a supplement to the policy in the university-wide student handbook. Faculty members, directors, and/or chairs, with reasonable cause to believe that a student has committed an act of academic dishonesty, must refer the infraction directly to the department CSP , whose recommendation must then be forwarded to the department chair. If the student appeals the decision of the department chair, the appeal must be in writing and submitted to the chair of the Academic Honesty Committee (AHC) within five business days (excluding holidays and weekends) after the date of receiving notification of the department chair's decision. The appeal must contain a concise statement of all relevant facts and the result sought. Participation by legal representatives with regard to preparation of the written appeal is prohibited. The appeal may be submitted in hard copy, including a mailing address, and should also be emailed to the chair of the AHC to expedite committee response. The AHC will hear all student appeals of decisions recommended by the committee and concurred with by the department chair of each of the individual departments of the College of Health Care Sciences. The Academic Honesty Hearing is an informal proceeding conducted by the Academic Honesty Committee (AHC) upon the written request of the student in question. No rules of evidence will be used. The AHC will convene a hearing which shall be internal, private, and closed to those not associated with the university. Nonuniversity personnel are not available for consultation during these hearings. Legal representation or any other form of representation during the appeal hearing is prohibited. No recording devices will be permitted during the hearing process. All procedures and actions are aimed to safeguard and preserve the educational and developmental mission of the College of Health Care Sciences. Based on the review by the Academic Honesty Committee, a recommendation will be sent to the dean for final disposition. Actions taken in these cases may include, but are not limited to, no action, assignment failure, course failure, suspension, or dismissal.126 College of Health Care Sciences The Academic Honesty Committee is composed of faculty representatives from each discipline within the College of Health Care Sciences. Once the student appeals to the AHC, the student is notified in writing as to his or her right to a formal hearing before the committee. The student's department chair is also notified once the hearing date and time are set or if the student waives his or her right to be heard. The AHC chair advises the dean of the committee's recommendations, following review of the testimony and evidence. The dean will review the recommendations of the AHC and notify the student, the program chair or director, and the AHC chair in writing of the final disciplinary decision. Students have the right to appeal the dean's decision only in cases resulting in dismissal of the students and must do within five working days of receipt of notification. The appeal must be submitted in writing to the chair of the college-wide appeals committee. Appeals not submitted within the aforementioned timeframe shall not be heard. Appeals must follow the procedures outlined in the section entitled Student Appeals, later in this section. Disciplinary Warning/Probation/Suspension/Dismissal The purpose of this policy is to ensure adherence to the university's Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility and provide guidance to students who may be in violation of the code. \"This code seeks to promote high standards of behavior and academic integrity by setting forth the respon- sibilities of students as members of the university community. Abiding by the code ensures a climate wherein all members of the university community can exercise their rights of membership\" (2010-2011 College of Health Care Sciences Student Handbook). The College of Health Care Sciences has adopted disciplinary standards designed to identify those students who are in violation of the student conduct policies, and to provide timely intervention through advising and support. The policy addresses disci - plinary conduct at four levels\u2014Warning, Probation, Suspension, and Dismissal. The university reserves the right to take appropriate action to impose sanctions at any level it deems appropriate based on the nature of the violation of the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility. The university also reserves the right to take additional disciplinary action as it deems appropriate. Warning Disciplinary Warning is the least severe of the three levels of Disciplinary action and will not appear on the official transcript, but will be placed in the student's program file. Disciplinary Warning serves as an opportunity to address code infractions with the goal of preventing a student from being placed on Disciplinary Probation. It is a written notification that any violation of the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility may result in additional disciplinary action. It is a \"disciplinary sanc- tion serving notice to a student that his/her behavior has not met university standards. This sanction remains in effect for a designated number of semesters of attendance, after which it is expunged from the student's file.\" (2010-2011 College of Health Care Sciences Student Handbook). A student who violates the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility will be referred to the departmental Committee on Student Progress. Please see the Committee on Student Progress procedures in the College of Health Care Sciences section of this handbook. Probation Disciplinary Probation is one disciplinary level higher than Disciplinary Warning and appears on the student's official transcript. Probation serves as an opportunity to address serious disciplinary difficulties College of Health Care Sciences 127 with the goal of preventing expulsion from the program. It is a \"disciplinary sanction serving notice to a student that his/her behavior is in serious violation of university standards. A time period is indicated during which another violation of the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility will automatically raise the question of a more severe sanction (suspension or expulsion) if the student is found in violation.\" (2010-2011 College of Health Care Sciences Student Handbook). A student who violates the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility will be referred to the departmental Committee on Student Progress. Please see the Committee on Student Progress procedures in the College of Health Care Sciences section of this handbook. Suspension Suspension is one disciplinary level higher than Probation and appears on the student's official transcript. It is a mandatory separation from the program for a period of time specified in an order of suspen - sion. Suspension is stipulated when a student violates the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility and/or does not meet the conditions of his or her probation, as described above. Readmission to the program will not be entertained until the period of separation indicated in the suspension order has elapsed and is subject to approval of the department chair/program director. During the period of suspension, the student may be subject to other restrictions, which will be outlined by the student's program. A student who violates the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility will be referred to the departmental Committee on Student Progress. Please see the Committee on Student Progress procedures in the College of Health Care Sciences section of this handbook. Dismissal Dismissal is the final and most severe step in the levels of disciplinary recourse. Dismissal is stipulated when students violate the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility and/or do not meet the conditions of their probation, as described above. A student who violates the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility will be referred to the departmental Committee on Student Progress, which will make recommendations to the depart- ment chair/program director. The college reserves the right, and the student by his or her act of matriculation concedes to the college the right, to require withdrawal at any time the college deems it necessary to safeguard its standards of scholarship, professional behavior, and compliance with regulations, or for such other reasons as are deemed appropriate. A student who is dismissed because of a violation of the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility may be required to reapply to the program in order to be considered for readmission under the admissions standards applicable for the next class. However, readmission is not guaranteed and is ultimately at the discretion of the program director. The applicant will be treated as a first-time competitive applicant for the purposes of coursework and must repeat and pass all required coursework. Students are instructed to refer to their college's individual program policies regarding readmission, because exceptions or additional restrictions may apply. Faculty members should use the Data Change Form when probation, etc., is to be notated on a tran- script. The form can be accessed at www.nova.edu/cwis/registrar/forms/data_change.pdf and should be sent to EPS data entry when completed.128 College of Health Care Sciences Course Remediation Cost The cost of repeating a course is not covered in the regular tuition. Students who fail a course, didactic or fieldwork, will be required to repeat the course and will be charged a per semester hour rate as determined by the executive vice chancellor and provost. Course Remediation\u2014Applies to entry-Level Programs only The purpose of course remediation is to assure mastery of the material taught in a course, not only for earning good grades, but also to develop proficiency to guide decision-making in clinical and nonclinical situations. Please note that the term \"Examination\" is being used generically throughout this document to imply any assessment method that is employed by a program. Individual programs may elect to allow remediation for all courses, core courses, or only specific courses. Note: Successful remediation of a course does not constitute a course failure. A course is considered failed when the final course grade as noted on the transcript is an F . When offered, the following guidelines should be followed: 1. A student who earns a grade less than the minimum passing grade for a final course grade will remediate the course through the appropriate mechanism (written examination, prac- tical examination, oral presentations, etc.). 2. A course remediation examination will only be allowed one time per course, at a date no earlier than three business days or no greater than five business days after the course or semester ends. Justifiable exceptions, such as a student appeal process or semester breaks, may necessitate an adjustment to that timeline. 3. A student may remediate no more than two courses during his or her enrollment in the respective program. 4. Prior to a remediation examination, a student who fails a course will meet with his/her faculty adviser or designee to devise an appropriate remediation plan. 5. If a student is successful on course remediation, the highest grade achievable will be the minimum passing grade for that course, and an E will be notated after the remediated grade [e.g., C(E) or 75E ], on the student's transcript except in circumstances as notated in number seven. 6. A student who fails a course remediation will receive a failing grade for the course. The transcript should reflect the preremediated or the remediated course grade, whichever is higher. The program policies related to course failures will then be applied. 7. In courses with distinctly separate written and practical grade components, a student who fails that course may, at the discretion of the program chair/director, be required to remediate both components or only the failed component. If successfully remediated, the student will receive the minimum passing grade for that component as well as the course, rather than the actual grade received on the remediated exam. StuDent APPeALS Policy and Procedure The Student Appeals Hearing is an informal proceeding conducted by the College-Wide Appeals Committee (CWAC) upon the written request of the student in question. This written request must be received by the chair of the CWAC within five business days of student notification from the chair of the department. Participation by legal representatives with regard to preparation of the written request is prohibited. No rules of evidence will be used. The hearing shall be internal, private, and closed to those not associated with the university. Nonuniversity personnel are not available for consultation College of Health Care Sciences 129 during these hearings. Legal representation or any other form of representation during the appeal hearing is prohibited. No recording devices will be permitted during the hearing process. All procedures and actions are aimed to safeguard and preserve the educational and developmental mission of the College of Health Care Sciences. The purpose of the CWAC is to review decisions to ensure the policies and procedures of the University, HPD, and the College of Health Care Sciences have been followed. No new evidence which was not presented to the department will be considered by the CWAC. Appeals Committee Responsibilities The CWAC will hear all student appeals of decisions recommended by the committee and concurred with by the department chair of each of the individual departments of the College of Health Care Sciences relating to dismissal or disciplinary actions involving professional issues. The CWAC will review the decision to ensure the policies and procedures of the University, HPD, and the College of Health Care Sciences have been followed. If a student appeals the decision of the department chair, the appeal must be in writing and submitted to the chair of the CWAC within five business days (excluding holidays and weekends) after the date of receiving notification of the department chair's decision. Any appeals not submitted to the chair of the Appeals Committee within this time frame shall not be heard. The appeal must contain a concise statement of all relevant facts and the result sought. The CWAC will not consider evidence which was not presented to the department or the Departmental Committee on Student Progress. The appeal may be submitted in hard copy, including a mailing address, and should also be emailed to the chair of the Appeals Committee to expedite committee response. Appeals Committee membership The Appeals Committee shall consist of the chancellor or vice chancellor of the Health Professions Division or designee; six faculty members from the College of Health Care Sciences, one of whom will be elected by the members of the committee to serve as chair; and one representative from the dean's office and/or Office of Student Affairs. The dean's office/student affairs representative is a nonvoting member and assures that policies and procedures are carried out to protect the rights of the student and to assure that the policies of the college are followed. Each department chair will be responsible for appointing one faculty representative. The chair of the CWAC will participate in the voting process only in the case of a tie or if the chair is counted to make a quorum. Hearings Protocol and Procedure The student will be notified of the date, place, and time of the hearing via email to the student's NSU email address (read receipt requested) and via certified mail to the student's last known address, or via hand delivery with receipt. Any student who fails to appear at the designated date and time will automatically waive his or her right to appeal. The Appeals Committee hearing will proceed under the direction of the chair. A quorum must be present to convene an official appeal hearing and will be constituted by 50 percent or more of the voting membership including the chair. The student will provide the committee chair with a list of any witnesses he or she may have, in writing, no later than two business days before the hearing date. Only witnesses with direct infor - mation that is related to the program director/department chair or the Department Committee on Student Progress's failure to adhere to the policies and procedures of the University, HPD, and/or the College of Health Care Sciences in making its decision will be considered. The student will be present only during his or her testimony. Witnesses, if any, may be present only during their testimony. Each witness will be housed in a separate waiting area to avoid any contact among witnesses or with the student.130 College of Health Care Sciences The Appeals Committee may question any witnesses present during the hearing. The Appeals Committee will have the option of calling more witnesses. The student shall not be present during the questioning of any witnesses. Appeals Committee Hearing Process The chair will convene the hearing with only committee members present. The chair will advise the committee members of the violation(s) and the department decision, review the evidence, respond to any questions, and provide opportunity for preliminary discussions. The chair will call the student into the hearing room and introduce the student to the committee members. The student will have an opportunity to present his or her appeal, provide statements, summarize his or her position, and respond to any questions from the committee members. The chair will then dismiss the student from the hearing. Witnesses will be called individually by the committee and questioned without the student being present. Witnesses may be asked to remain outside the hearing room for later recall or may be dismissed at the committee's discretion. The committee members will render a decision on the student's appeal by a majority vote of the voting members in attendance. The committee may delay the vote if it determines that additional information or facts are needed before a vote. Note: At the discretion of the committee, the chair of the respective department Committee on Student Progress and/or the respective program chair/director may also be called during the hearing. notification of the Appeals Committee Decision The decision of the committee will be forwarded in writing by the chair to the student by certified mail to his or her last official address or hand delivered with receipt. Copies will be delivered to the department chair. All decisions of the Appeals Committee will be final and binding. No further option for appeal will be considered. BeHAVIoRAL St AnDARDS Dress Code Students must maintain a neat and clean appearance befitting students attending a professional program. Therefore, attire should convey a professional appearance whenever the student is on campus or at any off-campus educational site. The dress code is to be maintained at all times in the Administration Building, classrooms, laboratories, and all areas involved in providing patient care. Additionally, the dress code is in force Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. in the library and in other areas not mentioned above. Those failing to comply may be dismissed from the classroom and/or campus. A written warning describing the infraction will be entered into the student's file. The following constitutes acceptable and professional attire: white clinical jackets at all times for students enrolled in all entry-level programs shirts, tie, slacks, and regular shoes for men professional business dress, which includes slacks, pants, or skirts with blouses, or dresses, and appropriate shoes for women matching scrub sets and shoes College of Health Care Sciences 131 No institutional scrubs may be worn by any College of Health Care Sciences student at any time while on campus. Institutional scrubs are those that have the identification symbols or lettering from the institution that owns or issues them. Those scrubs are marked in locations that are easy to identify as being part of the inventory of that institution. Students may not wear the following: shorts or cutoffs, miniskirts (higher than mid-thigh), jeans (all colors), see-through clothing or halter tops, sandals, flip-flops, T-shirts (as the outer shirt), jogging or exercise clothing, inappropriately mismatched garments, hats, or caps. Students must wear their approved NSU ID badges while on campus. The dress code is to be observed at all times including midterms and examination periods. Students are expected to consult their specific program handbooks for compliance with any program-specific supplemental dress code policies. Classroom Behavior Talking during lectures to those nearby is disturbing to others who desire to hear the lecture. The instructor may dismiss anyone from class who is involved in disruptive behaviors while in class or labo - ratory. Hats, other than religious cover, are not to be worn indoors. Food and drinks are not permitted in auditorium, laboratories, or library. netiquette In a traditional classroom, students are reminded that behavior that disrupts the class or interferes with other students and their ability to learn is unacceptable. Any person engaged in disruptive behavior receives a written warning from the instructor. Students who continue to engage in disruptive behavior after this warning may be administratively withdrawn from the course. Similarly, in an online course, any electronic postings, emails, or electronic messages that disrupt the class or interfere with learning goals and objectives are unacceptable. Electronic communication\u2014the backbone of online courses\u2014must be civil, respectful, and cordial at all times. Any posting that disrupts or interferes with learning will be removed, and the author of the posting will receive a written warning. A second disruptive posting will cause the author to be administratively withdrawn from the course. Drug Screening The College of Health Care Sciences maintains affiliation agreements with many health care institutions. These affiliation agreements allow for student clinical training experiences within these institutions. Students may be required to undergo random drug screening, at the request of these institutions, prior to entering the facility for training. Drug Policy\u2014Zero t olerance The College of Health Care Sciences has a zero tolerance policy for drug use. This includes the use of illegal drugs; the use of controlled substances without a prescription; and the use of, or being under the influence of, alcohol while on rotation/clinical experience or in class. Should a student receive a posi - tive drug or alcohol screen and follow-up screen, the student will be expelled from his or her program. If a student reports to the academic program for help with a personal drug or alcohol concern prior to being informed of an impending drug test, the student will be required to report to the dean's office for referral to the HPD Student Assistance Program. The student will only be permitted to report to class or a rotation/clinical experience if cleared by the HPD Student Assistance Program and the College of Health Care Sciences Dean's Office.132 College of Health Care Audiology Department is dually accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Audiology Education (ACAE) and the Council on Academic Accreditation (CAA) of the American Speech- Language-Hearing Association (ASHA).

DePAR tment of AuDIoL oGy Academic Promotions and Progression The progress of each student through the curriculum requires continuous satisfactory academic and clinical performance. Since many of the curriculum's courses are offered only one time per year, a student may have to alter his or her plan of study if he or she does not satisfactorily progress each semester. This may extend the student's program beyond 12 semesters/4 years. There is a maximum six-year time limit for program completion, which includes any requested leave of absence and subsequent return to the program.The curriculum is divided into core/foundation courses, clinical courses, and other academic courses. The following courses in the curriculum are considered core/foundation courses. Students who do not earn a grade of 80 percent or better in these courses may not continue in the program until the course is taken again at its next offering, which is typically two semesters later. AUD 5301 Diagnostics I AUD 5301L Diagnostics I Laboratory AUD 5302 Acoustics and Instrumentation AUD 5304 Anatomy and Physiology AUD 5403 Introduction to AUD 5403L Electrophysiology Laboratory Auditory Electrophysiology AUD Introduction to 5405 Overview of Amplification I AUD 5405L Amplification I Laboratory AUD 5602 Intensive Clinical Laboratory AUD 6402 Diagnostics II Students must earn a grade of 80 percent or better in clinical courses AUD 6603, AUD 6604, AUD 6605, and AUD 6606 and a pass in clinical courses AUD 7607, AUD 7608, AUD 7609, AUD 7610, AUD 7611, and AUD 7612. If a grade below 80 percent or a fail is earned in a clinical course, the course must be repeated in the next semester, and this will alter the student's plan of study and may affect future clinic rotation and/or placement. If a student is terminated from an internship (AUD 7607, 7608, 7609) or externship (AUD 7610, 7611, 7612) at any point during the internship or externship, the student will fail the internship or externship and immediately be referred to the Committee on Student Progress (CSP) for review. The remaining courses in the curriculum are not core/foundation or clinical courses and are termed other academic courses. If a student fails to earn a grade of 80 percent or better in any of these courses, the student must repeat the course in the next semester in which the course is offered. The student may continue in the program, but the plan of study may be altered as a result.136 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Department of Audiology Grading Policies, Procedures, and Course f ailures Alpha Grade A A- B+B 0.0Percent94-100 90-93 87-8983-86 80-82 0-79 A minimum grade of 80 percent must be earned in each course in the curriculum. If a student achieves a grade below 80 percent in any course, the student therefore fails the course and must repeat the course during the next semester in which the course is offered. If the course is a core/foundation course, the student may not continue on in the program until the failed course is retaken and passed. Due to the course sequence in the curriculum, students may need to take a leave of absence from the program until the course is offered again. A course may be repeated only one time. When repeating a course, the student must earn a grade of 80 percent or better in the repeated course. Students in clinical courses who do not earn a grade of 80 percent or better will be required to repeat the course the next semester. This may alter a student's plan of study and extend his or her program beyond 12 semesters/four years. A clinical course may be repeated only one time. If a student repeats a clinical course and does not earn a grade of 80 percent or better or a pass, the student will immediately be referred to the Committee on Student Progress (CSP) and may be dismissed from the program.A student will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress (CSP) to review the circumstances of any course failure. While matriculating through the audiology program, a student is permitted to retake a total of two courses. When a third course grade below 80 percent is earned, the student will be referred to the CSP and may be dismissed from the program. Incomplete Coursework Students who are unable to complete the requirements for a course within the term limits may request, in writing, a grade of I (incomplete) from the professor. This request must be made in writing to the professor, who has the sole discretion to accept or reject the request. To be eligible for a grade of I , the student must be earning a grade of 80 percent or better at the time of the request. If the request is accepted by the professor, the professor shall provide to the student the terms and conditions of an \"incomplete contract.\" It is the student's responsibility to complete the requirements of the incomplete contract within the prescribed time limits. Incomplete coursework must be completed by the end of the next semester the course is offered or within one year from the end of the course, whichever is sooner. Failure to successfully complete the contract automatically results in a failing grade. Accreditation The NSU Department of Audiology Doctor of Audiology program is dually accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Audiology Education (ACAE) and the Council on Academic Accreditation (CAA) of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA). With respect to the ACAE, submission of any complaints relating directly to lack of compliance with the Accreditation Standards and requirements of accreditation must be made in writing and signed College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Department of Audiology 137 by the complainant. The complainant's contact information including address and telephone number is to be included with the complaint. The submitted complaint must include specific details and documentation to support the complaint and should be sent to the executive director, Accreditation Commission for Audiology Education, 1718 M Street, NW #297, Washington, D.C. 20036-4504. The telephone number is (202) 986-9500, and the facsimile number is (202) 986-9550. Upon receipt of the complaint, the executive director of ACAE will forward a copy to the department chair within 10 business days, for response and appropriate documentation. If the complainant identi - fication is to be withheld, the complaint will be forwarded in a de-identified format. The department chair will then have 30 business days to respond to the complaint, including providing documentation to support the response. With respect to CAA, grievances about the program must relate to the standards for accreditation of education programs in audiology and include verification, if the complaint is from a student or faculty/ instructional staff member, that the complainant exhausted all institutional grievance and review mechanisms before submitting a complaint to the CAA. All grievances must be signed and submitted in writing to the chair, Council on Academic Accreditation, American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2200 Research Boulevard, Rockville, M.D. 20850- 3289. The complaint must clearly describe the specific nature of the complaint and the relationship of the complaint to the accreditation standards, as well as provide supporting data for the charge. The burden of proof rests with the complainant. All written testimony must include the complainant's name, address, and telephone contact information, as well as the complainant's relationship to the program. Complaints will not be accepted by email or facsimile. Clinical experience and Placement Students registering for both on- and off-campus clinical activities must complete a schedule showing times that they are available for clinic placements. A minimum of 12 hours per week, including morning and afternoon time slots, must be made available in the first two years of the program. A minimum of two full days per week during the third year must be made available. This schedule will be used to determine the student's clinical assignments. The student's initial clinic schedule is assigned at the beginning of each semester. However, the program reserves the right to alter assignments during the semester using the student's schedule of available times as a reference. In the fourth year, the student must be available full time to complete his or her supervised professional experience. Failure to meet scheduled appointments is considered unethical and unprofessional behavior. Students will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress (CSP) for unethical/unprofessional behavior. Review of the circumstances of the incident by the committee may result in the student's placement on disciplinary probation or dismissal from the program, which will be reflected on the student's transcript. Students will be assessed on expected clinical competencies. Each clinical activity and competency must be successfully completed before the student is allowed to progress to the next clinical level. Successful completion will be determined by an evaluation of the student's clinical performance by his or her preceptor(s) and faculty. Confidentiality involves protection of the information obtained from conversation with patients and families, written information, and electronic communication. Conversations regarding any patient should not involve the name of the patient. Written work, including diagnostic reports and management, and treatment notes, including notes and reports from other professionals, should never be left in any 138 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Occupational Therapy Department place where others may have access to the information. Grand rounds or class presentations must not include identifying information. Faxes must adhere to university policy. Electronic communication regarding patient information is not permitted. Students in off-site clinical rotations or placements will be required to comply with all Department of Audiology requirements and the special requirements of the facility. These requirements may include, but are not limited to, fingerprinting, proof of vaccinations, proof of insurance, drug testing, and a background check. The program does not assume any responsibility other than informing the student of the requirements. The student must fully comply with all requirements of the Department of Audiology and the specific facility before participating in any activities at that facility. Failure to be eligible to participate in activities at an assigned facility will result in the student not being allowed to complete the clinical experience during the assigned semester and may result in a failing grade for the clinical rotation for the semester. This may alter a student's plan of study. The program will not reassign a student who failed to meet the stated requirements of the facility during the semester in which the original assignment was made. If a student must be reassigned at the beginning of a new semester for failure to meet the facility's requirements, the student's individual timeline for completion of the program will be impacted. Students are videotaped in certain academic classes and clinical labs for teaching-learning purposes. Students must sign a release form for videotaping at the time of registration. Students should obtain permission from professors to videotape or audiotape lectures. Verbal permission is acceptable. Affiliation Policy Faculty members and students disseminating information that emanates from their work in the audiology program must list Department of Audiology, College of Health Care Sciences, Health Professions Division, Nova Southeastern University in the affiliation byline. Attendance Absences and tardiness are strongly discouraged. Students are required to attend all classes and to arrive on time. A student is tardy if he or she arrives after the designated class time. The student is responsible for any information missed. Students who are repeatedly tardy or absent will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress (CSP), and it may result in Disciplinary Warning, Probation, Suspension, or Dismissal from the program. oCCuPA tIonAL tHeRAP y DePAR tment Academic Promotions and Progression The progress of each student through the curriculum requires continuous satisfactory academic performance. No student may advance to the second year of study without satisfactorily completing all first-year courses. Since most of the courses in the curriculum are offered only one time per year, a student who does not satisfactorily complete all first-year courses will have to suspend his or her studies by withdrawal in order to comply with the following academic policies. College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Occupational Therapy Department 139 Grading Policies and Procedures Grading for Master of Occupational Therapy students is based on a scale of 0-100 percent. P or Pass C (75 percent) or above for all OCT prefix courses (A grade of C for the anatomy and neuroanatomy courses is equivalent to 70 percent.) F or Fail Below a C (75 percent) for each OCT prefix and below a C (70 percent) for anatomy and neuroanatomy courses Grading for all OCT prefix courses is based on an alpha scale as shown. Alpha Grade A A-B+ B B- C+ 75-760-74 A student who receives a failing course grade will have an opportunity to remediate the course by taking a comprehensive reexamination for that course. Due to the nature of fieldwork experience, there is no mechanism to take a comprehensive examina- tion following a failed fieldwork. Students who fail a level I fieldwork experience will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress (CSP). Based on the recommendations of the CSP and department chair, the student may be given the opportunity to repeat the level I experience. Should the student fail a second level I fieldwork, the student will be automatically dismissed from the program. Students will only be permitted to participate in level II fieldwork experiences after successful completion of all required academic coursework. Students who fail a level II fieldwork experience will be required to meet with CSP to determine a course of action prior to scheduling a repeat fieldwork experience. The department chair will have the final decision whether to accept the CSP recommendation or provide an alternate one based on her discretion. Students may only retake one level II fieldwork experience. Should students fail a second fieldwork experience, they will be considered to have failed two level II fieldwork experiences and will be dismissed from the M.O.T. program. Additional tuition will be charged for repeated courses, including, but not limited to, level II fieldwork experiences. The maximum final grade M.O.T. students may earn on any didactic course after any remediation will be a C (E). The maximum final grade in level II fieldwork experiences is a pass (P), as numerical scores are not assigned in those courses. Grading for doctor of occupational therapy students (Ph.D. or Dr.OT) is based on an alpha scale as shown above. Some courses may be pass/fail. Doctoral students must maintain an overall grade point average of 3.0. Ph.D. and Dr.OT students must pass all coursework with a B (80 percent) or higher. Alpha Grade Percent A 90-100 B 80-89 (A grade of B/80 percent or above is required to pass in all courses)140 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Occupational Therapy Department F 0-79 P or Pass B (80 percent) or above in core courses and Dr.OT electives F or Fail Below a B (80 percent) in core courses and Dr.OT electives I Incomplete Incomplete Coursework A student may receive a grade of I (incomplete) in a course if he/she is passing the course, based on all completed coursework to date, but is unable to complete all course requirements. An incomplete will be changed to an earned grade upon a student's satisfactory completion of the course or fieldwork requirements. A change from an incomplete to an earned grade must occur prior to the first day of the next academic year, or the student's grade will be converted to an F . The taking of incompletes is strongly discouraged and requires written approval of the course instructor. Dress Code The Occupational Therapy Department observes the HPD dress code whether on or off campus. In addition, occupational therapy students may wear occupational therapy polo shirts and either khaki or dark-colored trouser-, boot-, or straight-legged pants only when engaged in pre-service or service learning experiences, or during special events, either on or off campus, at the discretion of the depart - ment. Slim or tight leg pants, including leggings, and shorts of any length are not acceptable. Professional membership Upon entry into the M.O.T. program, students are required to obtain membership with the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) and sustain that membership throughout the duration of the curriculum. Maintaining AOTA membership will ensure access to necessary professional resources required throughout courses and will facilitate development of a professional identity. Professional engagement All M.O.T. students are required to attend at least one regional, state, or national conference or meeting per year while enrolled in the program. In addition, students must participate in 16 hours of volunteer service and professional development activities per year. Failure to complete these requirements will result in a referral to the Committee on Student Progress and may affect the student's standing in the program. Authorship Credit and order Guidelines and Policy Principal authorship, order of authorship, and other publication credits should accurately reflect the relative scientific, technical, professional, or scholarly contributions of the individuals involved. No authorship credit should be given to someone whose suggestion/idea/feedback may have influenced a project, but did not actively participate in project development and implementa - tion. This person could be acknowledged as described in bullet five (following). Authorship is not merited solely for administrative support, financial contribution, or a super - visor/adviser's position. Authorship credit should go to those who do the actual writing and to those who have made significant scientific or scholarly contributions to a study, such as formulating hypotheses, struc - turing the design, conducting the analysis, interpreting results, or writing a major portion of a manuscript. Those with minor contributions to the manuscript are appropriately acknowledged in footnotes, an introductory statement, or acknowledgements. College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Occupational Therapy Department, Tampa 141 Student as author - A student is usually listed as a principal author on a multiple-authored paper that is substan - tially based on the student's dissertation, report, or project. - However, he or she is not automatically entitled to authorship if only some or minor material from the project is used in a paper, proposal, or progress or final report written by the student's adviser, a faculty member, or supervisor. Reference to the material's origin is sufficient in these cases. - If the student's dissertation or project is based on data collected as part of a larger research project under the supervision of one or more faculty members, it is appropriate to include those supervisors or faculty members as coauthors. - Submissions for publication or professional presentations (to include posters) that originated from a previous class assignment (papers, reports, projects, etc.) should first be discussed and agreed upon with the course instructor. Coauthorship may be a complex issue in certain cases. It is suggested that authorship credit and order be discussed with all possible collaborators before and during the project. There should be an agreement, especially with projects that involve multiple key contributors, to minimize the chance of misunderstandings. Major revisions to a manuscript for publication or professional presentation may result in a change of responsibilities or work effort. This may require a revision in authorship order and/or credit. These changes should be discussed and agreed upon before and during any major revision process. Institutional Affiliation -Publishers usually require each author's institutional affiliation. - Authors should acknowledge the department and institution where the primary work was done, as well the current institutional affiliation of each author. - Occupational Therapy Department, College of Health Care Sciences, Nova Southeastern University is the institutional affiliation. Authors must obtain approval from the chair, Occupational Therapy Department, Nova Southeastern University, prior to submitting an abstract or manuscript to a publisher or a conference committee. Department approval serves to (1) protect the department, college, and university by allowing the chair (or designee) to review all submissions for appropriateness and acceptable standards; (2) recog - nize and record all department-related publications and presentations as program outcomes; and (3) assure that submissions provide appropriate credit and recognition. This policy applies to publication submissions; professional presentations; and posters by students, former students, alumni, and current and former faculty and staff members of the Occupational Therapy Department, Nova Southeastern University, when applicable.

Program abides by the CHCS Remediation Policy. See page XX in this handbook for the CHCS Remediation Policy. A student who receives a failing course grade may be offered an opportunity to remediate the course through the appropriate mechanism, which may include taking and passing a comprehensive reexamination for that course. The opportunity to remediate an individual course is dependent upon the discretion of the course professor. Remediation examination must occur within five business days after the course ends, unless a justifiable exception necessitates adjustment to that timeline. Justifiable exceptions, such as a student appeal process or semester breaks, may necessitate an adjustment to that timeline. Written remediation examination may occur at the Tampa Regional Campus or online in a proctored environment and at the cost of the student. Practical remediation reexamination must occur at the Tampa Regional Campus. The student is responsible for any associ-ated cost for returning to the regional campus for this purpose. A student will be permitted to participate in a Level I fieldwork experience (FWE-I) only if he or she is passing or has passed all corresponding didactic coursework up to the point of the fieldwork experience. A student who fails the didactic portion of an intervention course will not begin his or her FWE-I. The remediation process will delay the start of his or her FWE-I, and possibly subsequent Level II Fieldwork Experiences (FWE-II). Furthermore, a student who appeals course grades will not be allowed to begin a FWE-I during the appeal process. The courses listed as Occupational Therapy Interventions I, II, III (OTD 8271, OTD 8272, and OTD 8273), all include as well as Level I fieldwork experiences (FEW-I). A student who fails any of the three courses must retake the entire course, including the didactic and fieldwork experiences. Students will be permitted to participate in the first FWE-II, or OTD 8391 offered during the summer semester, only after successful completion of all required academic coursework prior to OTD 8391. Students who fail this first FWE-II rotation may or may not be offered the opportunity to retake the failed OTD 8391 immediately, which is during the fall semester. Upon the successful retake of the failed fieldwork rotation, the student will not be able to begin their coursework until the following College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Occupational Therapy Department, Tampa 143 fall semester with the next OTD cohort. Therefore, the student will not be enrolled in the winter and summer semesters, but will be able to reenroll with the next cohort in the fall semester. The same require - ment to immediately retake failed rotation for the FWE-II and Residency rotations will be enforced. Students may retake only one FWE-II. Should students fail a second FWE-II (which includes failing the same FWE-II twice), they will be considered to have failed two FWE-II and will be dismissed from the OTD program. Additional tuition will be charged for repeated courses, including Level II field - work experiences. The maximum final grade OTD students may earn on any didactic course after any remediation will be 75 percent. The maximum final grade in Level II fieldwork experiences is a pass (P), as numerical scores are not assigned in those courses. Participation in the Virtual Learning environment of the Hybrid (Blended) o.t.D. Program The student is responsible for keeping track of information posted in BlackBoard, the university's learning management system (LMS), which includes, but is not limited to, the postings in the O.T.D. Student Center, contents of the course syllabi, items posted in BlackBoard Collaborate, course messaging, online examinations, the Respondus Lockdown Browser, etc. The program expects students to use effective time management and appropriate use of electronic communication and social media if necessary. Participation During on-Campus Institutes O.T.D. students are required to be present and participate during four to five face-to-face institutes occurring every three or four weeks, strategically scheduled to have sessions occurring at the beginning, middle, and end of the semester. The institutes focus on application of learning and psychomotor skills, followed by active reflection and group/individual processing. Therefore, students are expected to have prepared according to individual faculty member instructions before coming to the institute. A make up for missed face-to-face institutes may be available at the discretion of the course faculty member. Absence from on-campus institutes is either excused or unexcused. Absence is excused when it is due to a fortuitous event, such as a natural disaster or emergency (e.g., hurricanes, transportation delay outside control of the student, or if it involves death in the immediate family or severe acute or contagious illness of the student). In the case of illness, the student must submit a statement from an attending physician regarding the reason for absence. Students with an excused absence may make up their assignments/exams. The final decision for an excused absence rests with the department chair. An unexcused absence may occur for any reason other than those listed above. In such cases, the student will have to make up the time at the discretion of the course faculty member. In addition, the student will not be able to make up any graded assignment or exam that occurred during the on-campus institute and will receive a 0 for that assignment or examination. Participation in Capstone Project The research sequence of the O.T.D. curriculum is embedded in seven courses of the curriculum, namely OTD 8101: Introduction to Didactic, Clinical and Project II\u2014Reflections and Exit Colloquium. This sequence allows the students to experience the research process from conceptualization to dissemination of results, thereby complying not only with the O.T.D. curriculum requirements, but also with the research component of the standards for doctoral-level occupational therapy education of the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE). O.T.D. students are responsible for completion of these sequences, including satisfaction of all course requirements for graduation. Likewise, the student is responsible for all expenses related to the research implementation, data analysis, and results dissemination, including, but not limited to, travel costs to conference sites and to the scheduled Exit Colloquium at the NSU Tampa Regional Campus.144 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Occupational Therapy Department, Tampa Submission of Assignments Each course syllabus includes course-specific requirements and submission deadlines. Any assign - ment submitted after the assignment deadline will be subject to the consequences specified by the course instructor(s) and may affect the assignment grade and/or the final class grade as specified in the course syllabus. Incomplete Coursework A student may receive a grade of I (incomplete) in a course if he or she is passing the course, based on all completed coursework to date, but is unable to complete all course requirements due to documented medical reasons or extenuating personal circumstances. An incomplete will be changed to an earned grade upon a student's satisfactory completion of the course or fieldwork requirements. A change from an incomplete to an earned grade must occur prior to the first day of the next academic year, or the student's grade will be converted to an F . The taking of incompletes is strongly discouraged and requires written approval of the course instructor. The course instructor's written approval will specify the timeframe during which the course requirements must be completed. Conference Attendance and Service-Learning Requirements All O.T.D. students may be required to attend district, state, and/or national conferences or meetings as determined by the department chair or as required in certain courses. Participation in these confer - ences and meetings requires membership to state and/or national associations or societies, and provides membership benefits, as well as contributes to professional development. O.T.D. students are also required to participate in service-learning activities approved by the program. Failure to complete these requirements may impact the student's progression in the program, if not the graduation date. The most current service-learning policy and procedures are published in the BlackBoard Student Center. Computer Proficiency and Services Except for the weekend institutes, the majority of didactic experiences occur in the virtual environment. Therefore, all students are required to have a computer that meets the specifications according to the Hardware Guidelines for Computing at NSU, available at www.nova.edu/publications/it-standard. See the orientation computer requirement document for specific video, audio, browser, and photography guidelines. All students need to be proficient in, at minimum, computer technology, word processing, data management, search engines, and resource utilization. Except for the first semester, students are required to register online for all courses. Students register through WebStar, which they can access from the university home page or through SharkLink. The NSU Help Desk is an online resource available 24 hours a day to provide assistance for academic computer and technology problems. The Help Desk is available by phone at (954) 262-4357 or by email at help@nova.edu. travel, Housing, and Parking Although the NSU Tampa O.T.D. program is primarily online, approximately three-to-four day on-campus institutes occur every three or four weeks during the semester. Students are required to arrange their own travel and housing based on the schedule provided by the program office. While on campus, students with cars should have a parking permit or a temporary pass for campus parking. Parking permits or passes for campus parking are the responsibility of each student. Travel to and from the airport is the responsibility of each student. College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Occupational Therapy Department, Tampa 145 Student Identification Cards: the SharkCard NSU requires that students wear the NSU SharkCard (ID card) at all times. Students can complete an NSU SharkCard application (available online) and mail a passport-size photo to NSU Campus Card Services. Students can also obtain the SharkCard if they go to the main campus at the SharkCard Services Desk located in the Don Taft University Center (open Monday-Friday, 8:30 a.m.-6:00 p.m.) or at HPD in the One-Stop Shop located in the admissions area on the first floor of the Terry Building. The SharkCard provides access to all buildings, libraries, and the fitness center located in the Don Taft University Center. Each year, the NSU SharkCard provides students with $75 toward printing costs associated with printing at the computer labs on campus. Academic Advising and Administrative Support The department has a policy and procedure in place for academic advising. Prior to the mandatory orientation weekend, the chair assigns academic advisers to each student; an initial meeting between student advisees and their academic advisers occurs at a dedicated session during orientation. Students can access the current policy and procedure on student advising in the O.T.D. Student Center. Students are strongly encouraged to take advantage of this opportunity to develop a relationship with their adviser, and be proactive in their academic preparation. essential f unctions Most educational programs have technical standards or essential function policies that guide and protect the program and its students regarding reasonable expectations for admission, retention, and gradu - ation. Essential functions, as distinguished from fund of knowledge standards, refer to those abilities required for satisfactory completion of all aspects of a curriculum, including clinical education and the development of professional attributes required of all students at graduation. The essential functions required by the O.T.D. curriculum are observational, intellectual, cognitive, communication, cultural sensitivity, behavioral and social, physical, and professional functions. The most current Essential Functions Policy is in the BlackBoard O.T.D. Student Center. Authorship Credit and order Guidelines and Policy Principal authorship, order of authorship, and other publication credits should accurately reflect the relative scientific, technical, professional, or scholarly contributions of the individuals involved. No authorship credit should be given to someone whose suggestion/idea/feedback may have influenced a project, but did not actively participate in project development and implementa - tion. This person could be acknowledged as described in bullet five (following). Authorship is not merited solely for administrative support, financial contribution, or a super - visor/adviser's position. Authorship credit should go to those who do the actual writing and to those who have made signifi - cant scientific or scholarly contributions to a study, such as formulating hypotheses, structuring the design, conducting the analysis, interpreting results, or writing a major portion of a manuscript. Those with minor contributions to the manuscript are appropriately acknowledged in footnotes, an introductory statement, or acknowledgements. Student as author - Initially coauthorship between faculty member-student collaboration efforts may not clearly define who should be given authorship credit, and in what order the authors' names should appear on published work. Therefore it is especially important that all individuals involved in the project discuss authorship at the beginning of the project in order to complete the required Faculty Member-Student Agreement for Research and Authorship Form prior to substantial time on the project being invested.146 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Occupational Therapy Department, Tampa - A student is not automatically entitled to authorship if only some or minor material from the project is used in a paper, proposal, or progress or final report written by the student's adviser, a faculty member, or supervisor. Reference to the material's origin is sufficient in these cases. - If the student's project is based on data collected as part of a larger research project under the supervision of one or more faculty members, it is appropriate to include those supervi - sors or faculty members as coauthors. - Submissions for publication or professional presentations (to include posters) that originated from a previous class assignment (papers, reports, projects, etc.) should first be discussed and agreed upon with the course instructor with final approval granted by the chair, Department of Occupational Therapy, Nova Southeastern University\u2014Tampa. Coauthorship may be a complex issue in certain cases. It is suggested that authorship credit and order be discussed with all possible collaborators before and during the project. The Authorship Agreement for Research Form must be completed, especially with projects that involve multiple key contributors, to minimize the chance of misunderstandings. Major revisions to a project may result in changes in authorship order and/or credit. Project changes may include, but are not limited to, addition of author(s) that provided needed expertise and omitting author(s) as expertise was not included after the revisions and/or where expected work effort was not delivered as originally expected or agreed upon. These changes should be discussed and agreed upon before, and during, any major revision process, and a new agreement form should be completed. Institutional Affiliation -Publishers usually require each author's institutional affiliation. - Authors should acknowledge the department and institution where the primary work was done, as well the current institutional affiliation of each author. - Occupational Therapy Department, College of Health Care Sciences, Nova Southeastern University is the institutional affiliation. Authors must obtain approval from the chair, Department of Occupational Therapy, Nova Southeastern University\u2014Tampa, prior to submitting an abstract or manuscript to a publisher or a conference committee. Department approval serves to (1) protect the department, college, and university by allowing the chair (or designee) to review all submissions for appropriateness and acceptable standards; (2) recognize and record all department-related publications and presentations as program outcomes; and (3) assure that submissions provide appropriate credit and recognition. This policy applies to publication submissions; professional presentations; and posters by students, former students, alumni, and current and former faculty and staff members of the Occupational Therapy Department, Nova Southeastern University, when applicable.

College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Occupational Therapy Department, Tampa 147 Participation in f ieldwork experiences and Doctoral Residency The fieldwork component of the curriculum accumulates to more than 2,000 hours of clinical educa- tion comprising community field trips, level I and level II fieldwork experiences, and the culminating doctoral residency (called doctoral experiential component in ACOTE terms). Students are responsible for any travel or lodging expenses related to these clinical education experiences, which on certain occasions may require a short or long commute, across or out of state, depending on availability and program need. The student receives information about the clinical education component of the program during the New Student Orientation weekend, and continues throughout the program through ongoing commu - nication with the clinical and community relations administration and staff member comprising its director, the academic fieldwork coordinator, and the fieldwork support coordinator. The first course where the student receives information about clinical experiences is OTD 8101: Introduction to Didactic, Clinical, and Capstone Experiences, which introduces the student to the three major compo - nents of their doctoral education, one of which is clinical. The course provides not only information on community field trips related to coursework, level I fieldwork, and the doctoral residency, but also the paperwork process for fieldwork placement, required background checks and immunization, rules and regulations in health care, safety precautions, and preventive measures. OTD 8281: Business of Practice and Management and OTD 8282: Professional Leadership provide training in documentation and ethical and role delineation aspects of clinical practice, among other topics. Three intervention courses prepare the student for level I fieldwork experiences, namely OTD 8271: Occupational Therapy Interventions I\u2014Psychosocial and Community; Interventions and OTD 8273: Occupational Therapy Interventions III\u2014Physical Disabilities. Subject to availability and agreement with the department's educational philosophy, facilities receive requests for placement of one or more NSU Tampa O.T.D. students for the three-week rotation. The course faculty member collaborates with the academic and clinical fieldwork educators in identifying suitable facilities and in setting site- and student-specific goals and objectives for the fieldwork experience. Supervision of level I fieldwork experience may or may not be supervised by an occupational therapist, and may involve experiences from observation to supervised patient care depending on the contracted facility. Preparation for the doctoral residency or what ACOTE refers to as the doctoral experiential component starts in OTD 8101: Introduction to Didactic, Clinical, and Capstone Experiences, and continues throughout the curriculum. It is addressed directly in OTD 8392: Doctoral Certification and Introduction to the Residency Program; OTD 8391: Level II Fieldwork Experience; and II Fieldwork Experience; culminating with OTD 8494: Doctoral Residency. The residency is much like level I and level II fieldwork experiences in the selection and placement process. Like level I fieldwork, the residency may or may not be supervised by an occupational therapist or a professional who will serve as mentor to the student (mentee), but who has demonstrated expertise in one or more areas identified as the student's focused area of study. The eight areas of study are clinical practice, research, administration, leadership, program and policy development, advocacy, education, or theory development. textbooks Students will receive information about course textbooks prior to the start of the semester in the O.T.D. Student Center on Blackboard. Students may order textbooks from any source. However, it is highly recommended that students order the texts before the first day of the semester in time to complete their readings.148 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Physical Therapy Department Dress Code Students in the NSU Tampa O.T.D. Program are expected to comply with the dress code as outlined by the College of Health Care Sciences policy. In addition, individual courses may require lab or other attire as determined by the course professor. PHySICAL tHeRAP y DePAR tment entry-Level D.P.t . Programs\u2014f ort Lauderdale and tampa Academic Promotions and Progression The progress of each student through the curriculum requires continuous satisfactory academic performance. In order to complete the D.P .T. program in the normally scheduled three years for the Fort Lauderdale campus and four years for the Hybrid program on the Tampa campus must successfully complete the courses in the time and sequence that they are offered and meet the requirements outlined in the Essential Functions of the D.P .T. student document at www.nova.edu/chcs/pt/forms/nsu-dpt-essential -functions.pdf. Students who receive a final course grade of F in any didactic course will not be allowed to progress to the succeeding semester. In order to graduate from the program, each student must pass a comprehensive examination given at the end of the last year of the program. If eligible and based on department policy, a student who fails a clinical education course (clinical internship) may be given one opportunity to retake the course at a time and place determined by the director of clinical education. If the student fails the clinical education course a second time, he or she may be dismissed from the program. Students failing a clinical education course may be eligible to progress to the succeeding semester, until the next time the course is offered; however, they will not be allowed to progress to the next clinical education course until they have successfully completed any previously failed clinical education course. Grading Policies and Procedures Grading for physical therapy doctoral students is based on a scale of 0-100 percent. Some courses may be pass/fail. P Pass 75 percent or above F Fail below 75 percent Grading for all physical therapy courses is based on an alpha scale as shown. Alpha Grade AA- B+ B B- 0-74 Grades on the transcript will be qualified to indicate a repeated course or a remediation examination. When a student passes a course by a remediation examination, a minimum passing grade of C(E) will be recorded as the final grade for the course on the transcript. College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Physical Therapy Department 149 A final course grade of less than 75 percent in any given course will constitute a course failure. (This includes a grade achieved through a remediation examination.) The grade from a remediation examination can be no higher than 75 percent. As such, for the purpose of calculating a student's grade point average, a grade of 75 percent will be used for any course passed by remediation. Students who fail a course and/or the remediation examination will be sent to the Committee on Student Progress and may be dismissed. While matriculating through the entry-level D.P .T. programs, each student is permitted to remediate a total of two courses. Since a student who receives a final course grade of F in any course is not allowed to progress to the succeeding semester, he/she must successfully remediate the first course failure in order to be granted the opportunity to remediate a second course failure. A student will be allowed to sit for only one remediation examination per course. Information regarding the ultimate calculation and disposition of a student's final course grade may be found in the syllabus for each course. A student who is dismissed on the basis of inadequate academic performance or unprofessional conduct will be required to reapply to the program in order to be considered for readmission under the admissions standards applicable to the next class. Incomplete Coursework Contingent upon approval by the program director, a student who fails to complete all the requirements of a course because of documented medical reasons or extenuating personal circumstances may receive a grade of incomplete (I ). An incomplete will be changed to an earned grade upon the student's satisfactory completion of the course requirements. A change from an incomplete to an earned grade must occur prior to the end of the next semester or the course grade will be converted to an F and the student will be dismissed from the program. Exceptions to this rule may be considered in cases in which the course is not offered the following semester or a medical leave is granted for more than one semester. Attendance Attendance is mandatory for all scheduled instructional sessions and curricular activities. Conferences and Community Service Requirements All D.P .T. students are required to attend district, state, and national conferences or meetings as deter - mined by the program director. In addition, they must participate in service-learning activities organized by the program. Failure to complete these requirements may impact the student's graduation date. Submission of Assignments Any assignment submitted after the assignment deadline will be subject to a percentage point deduc- tion off the assignment grade and/or the final class grade as outlined in the course syllabus. entry Level D.P.t . Program\u2014f ort Lauderdale Academic Progression For classes that combine both psychomotor practical exams and written exams/assignments, students must obtain minimum of both of the following in order to pass the class: a 75 percent average on the written exams/assignments and a 75 percent average on the practicals. If at least a 75 percent is not obtained on both components, this will constitute a course failure, even if the overall course grade is above a 75 percent. If the student does not pass both components with at least a 75 percent, a cumulative remediation written and/or practical examination will be administered. A grade of 75 percent will be used for courses passed by remediation. 150 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Physical Therapy Department Communication with f aculty members Outside of class, one of the primary modes of communication with faculty members is email and Blackboard. Students are responsible for checking and replying to all faculty member communication through email and Blackboard on a regular basis (i.e., at least daily). Failure to do so may result in the student being referred to the CSP for unprofessional behavior. entry-Level D.P.t . Program Student Dress Code Students are expected to strictly adhere to dress code standards as established in the student handbook. The official scrub sets for the D.P .T. program are charcoal gray. For labs, students must wear charcoal gray scrub sets or any brand of navy-colored shorts and NSU approved T-shirts or the class T-shirt (preapproved by the faculty). Women should wear sports bras so that the torso can be exposed when needed. The course leader and the lab activities will dictate whether scrubs or shorts and T-shirts are required for lab. Nonskid, closed-toe, supportive shoes with socks are required. If a student has long hair, it must be tied back. Nails should be one-eighth inch or less. Minimal, nondangling jewelry may be worn. Wearing of navy-colored shorts and T-shirts will be limited solely to classroom lab hours and only on the second floor of the HPD Library Building. Students not dressed appropriately for lab may be asked to leave the class and an unexcused absence will be documented in the student's file. Any time that students are not on the second floor of the HPD Library Building, they must be dressed in charcoal gray scrub sets (matching shirt and pants and no T-Shirt unless underneath the scrub top) with a lab coat or the approved-dress NSU clinic uniform with a lab coat, and nonskid, closed-toe, supportive shoes with socks. The NSU clinic uniform/required professional dress is navy blue NSU polo-shirt and khaki slacks (no capris); nonskid, coat; student ID; wristwatch; and minimal, nondangling jewelry. If a student has long hair, it must be tied back. Nails should be one- eighth inch or less. Hybrid entry-Level D.P.t . Program\u2014t ampa Academic Progression In the D.P .T.\u2014Tampa program, students must pass each psychomotor exam with a 75 percent or higher in order to pass the class. A psychomotor exam is defined as any test of physical skills including skills checks, practical exams, and triple-jump exams. Students will have one opportunity to retake each psychomotor exam. Retake exams will be scheduled at the discretion of the instructor. Retake exam scores greater than or equal to 75 percent will be recorded as a 75 percent in the course grade book for that exam. Should a student be unsuccessful on any retake practical exam, he or she will fail the course and will follow the college/department policies for course remediation. Hybrid entry-Level D.P.t . Capstone Projects There are two capstone projects required for graduation from the HE-D.P .T. Program: an Evidence in Practice capstone project and the Value Portfolio project. These projects are worked on over time and presented during PHTT 6930 and PHTT 6904 immediately preceding graduation. These assignments are presented during wrap up immediately preceding graduation. Students must successfully complete and pass these projects to graduate. College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Physical Therapy Department 151 on-Campus Institutes for Hybrid entry-Level D.P.t . Students The Hybrid Entry-Level D.P .T. (HE-D.P .T.) Program is a blend of online and face-to-face classes. Weekend institutes are four days per month, and the focus of these institutes is on application of learning and psychomotor (physical) skills. Based on this program design, attendance to weekend institutes is mandatory. All missed face-to-face time must be made up at the discretion of the course instructor(s), regardless of whether the absence is excused or nonexcused. The following differentiates an excused from a nonexcused absence. Excused: Missed class because of natural disaster/emergency such as hurricanes, transportation delay outside control of the student, death in immediate family, severe acute or contagious illness. Students with an excused absence will be allowed to make up assignments/exams. The decision for an excused absence rests with the program director. Nonexcused: If a student is absent for any other reason than those listed above, he or she will have to make up the time (see above). In addition, he or she will not be able to make up any graded assign - ment or exam that occurred during the on-campus institute and will receive a 0 for that assignment or examination. Scheduling of Remediation examinations Students who are eligible for cumulative remediation examinations must abide by the CHCS remediation policies (see Page 128). Remediation examinations must be taken within five business days after the course ends unless a justifiable exception necessitates adjustment to that timeline. For practical remediation examinations, students will have to take the remediation practical examination at the Tampa Regional Campus and bear any associated costs associated with returning to the Tampa Regional Campus. For written remediation examinations, students will take the examination online in a proctored environment. Physical therapy Postprofessional Programs (Ph.D. and transition D.P.t .) Students enrolled in either the Doctor of Philosophy in Physical Therapy (Ph.D.) or Transition Doctor of Physical Therapy (T-D.P .T.) programs must follow all university policies and procedures. The following paragraphs highlight policies specific to each postgraduate doctoral program in physical therapy. textbooks Students will receive information about course textbooks prior to the start of the semester in the respec - tive Student Center on Blackboard. Students can order texts from any source; however, it is highly recommended that students order the texts before the first day of the semester. Web Access and Registration: SharkLink, email/Webmail, Blackboard, and WebStar Information on access to and utilization of email, registration processes, and electronic classes is provided in the respective program Student Handbook/Guidebook that is posted in the Student Centers on Blackboard. Computer Services Distance students are required to register online for all courses each semester. Students register through the WebStar system that can be accessed from the home page or through the SharkLink system. The Help Desk is an online resource available 24 hours/day. There you can get assistance with academic computer and technology problems. The Help Desk is available by phone at (954) 262-4357 or by email at help@nova.edu.152 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Physical Therapy Department travel, Housing, and Parking Although the postprofessional programs are primarily online, students in both programs are required to attend on-campus sessions each semester for most classes in which they are enrolled. Students are required to arrange their own travel and housing based on the schedule provided by the program office. Limited on-campus housing is available for these sessions. Contact the program office at (954) 262-1806 for more information. While on campus, students with cars should have a parking permit or a temporary pass that allows parking in any student area. NSU has a reliable, free on-campus shuttle system, and some of the nearby hotels offer free shuttle service as well. Travel to and from the airport is the responsibility of each student. Student ID Cards: the Shark Card NSU requires that students wear the NSU Shark Card (ID card) at all times. Students can complete an NSU Shark Card application (available online) and mail a passport-size photo to NSU Campus Card Services. Students can also obtain the shark card when they arrive on campus at the Shark Card Services Desk located in the Don Taft University Center (open Monday-Friday, 8:30 a.m.-6:00 p.m.) or at HPD in the One-Stop Shop located in the admission area on the first floor of the Terry Building. The Shark Card provides access to all buildings, libraries, and the fitness center located in the University Center. Each year, the NSU Shark Card provides students with $75 toward printing costs associated with printing at the computer labs on campus. Attendance All postprofessional courses are designed in distance learning formats. Each student holds the respon - sibility to fulfill all class requirements, access recommended resources, and meet the appropriate deadlines for assignment submission and exams. Students are required to access and participate in their Web-based class as defined by the course instructor. Policies regarding participation on discussion boards are usually defined in the course syllabus. Attendance at the on-campus component for each class is mandatory. Students who do not attend the on-campus component will receive an incomplete for the class until the on-campus requirements have been met (in the subsequent semester in which the class is offered). Students can assume that all on-campus classes are scheduled from 9:00 a.m. through 4:30 p.m. unless otherwise indicated by the course instructor. Return flights should be scheduled no earlier than 6:00 p.m. on the last day of any course. Course instructors may assign an incomplete to students who do not complete a full day of on-campus classes Academic Advising and Administrative Support Each student is required to contact the program director for academic advising before beginning the program. The program director and her or his designee will advise the student during matricu - lation through the program. Students may communicate with the director via phone, fax, email, or in person. Grading Policies and Procedures Grades for the Ph.D. and T-D.P .T. programs utilize an alpha letter grade designation based on a 0-100 scale; 90-100 is equivalent to an A , and 80-89 is equivalent to a B .Students are considered to have failed a course if they score below an 80. Failure of a course in the Ph.D. program may result in dismissal from the program. Failure of two courses in the T-D.P .T. program may result in dismissal from the program. In addition to alpha grading, the postprofessional programs may use transcript notations outlined in the College of Health Care Sciences section of the student handbook. College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Physical Therapy Department 153 Grading for Physical Therapy Ph.D. and Transition D.P .T. students is based on a scale of 0-100 percent. Some courses may be pass/fail. P FPassFail80 percent or abovebelow 80 percent Grading for all physical therapy courses is based on an alpha scale as shown. Alpha Grade A BFScale 4.0 3.00.0Percent 90-100 80-890-79 Administrative Withdrawals Unless prior approval or a leave of absence has been granted, students who do not enroll in any classes for two consecutive semesters may be administratively withdrawn (WU) from the postprofessional program. If a student is administratively withdrawn from the program, he or she would be required to petition the program director in writing for reinstatement in the program. Suspension/Dismissal Students enrolled in postprofessional programs have an obligation to conduct themselves in a manner compatible with the university's function as an educational institution. Students can be suspended and/ or dismissed from the postprofessional program for failure to meet academic standards, course failures, and/or unprofessional conduct. Please refer to the section of this handbook entitled Statement of Students Rights and Responsibilities. Academic Promotion The progress of each doctoral student through the curriculum requires continuous, satisfactory academic performance. Students in the T-D.P .T. program who fail a course have one opportunity to repeat the course. If students elect to repeat the course, they are required to register and pay for the course the next time it is offered, and must complete it with an 80 percent or higher in order to continue in the program. A second course failure may result in dismissal from the program. Students in the Ph.D. program who fail a course may be dismissed from the program. Incomplete Coursework A grade of incomplete (I) is issued only in cases of unexpected personal or professional emergen- cies, and must be made up within one term (or sooner) of the final class meeting of the course, as stipulated by the instructor. If the incomplete grade ( I) is not made up accordingly, it will be converted into a failing grade (F ). Courses that are only offered once per calendar year must be completed the next time the course is offered. Students must request any extension, in writing, from the course instructor with a copy to the program director. Students requesting extensions due to medical or military reasons are expected to provide official documentation. It is the student's responsibility to consult the instructor and submit the Incomplete Grade Agreement Form prior to the end of the course. The instructor will not accept assignments received after the date indicated on the agreement, and the student's grade will be assigned according to the work the student completed by the end of the course. A grade of I can only be assigned if 50 percent or more of the coursework has been completed. All assignments up to the date of the request must have been successfully completed. Incomplete grades that have not been changed by the official 154 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Physician Assistant Department, Fort Lauderdale date in this agreement will be converted to an F . The student must send this form via email to the instructor before the official end of the course. The subject line of the email must include the student's name and Incomplete Grade Agreement. Withdrawal from a Course (The following is the controlling policy for the Ph.D. and T-D.P .T. programs only.) The program adheres to the HPD tuition credit policy. Requests to withdraw from a class will be considered a drop for the first 10 calendar days of the term and not recorded on the university transcript. Requests to withdraw between the 11th and 20th calendar days of the term must be placed in writing to the program director. Students may receive a W , WP, or WF on their transcript. If the student retakes the course, the grade of W will be replaced by an earned grade. Dissertation The Ph.D. students are expected to conduct individual research, successfully defend their dissertation before a dissertation committee, and have verification of presentation or publication. Process and requirements are detailed in the Dissertation Guide. Students Rights and Responsibilities See Nova Southeastern University Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities.

In addition, students in the didactic phase of the curriculum will be required to wear a uniform for physical diagnosis lab and other labora- tory exercises throughout the curriculum. This uniform will include a gray, short-sleeved T-shirt with the PA program logo. No logo or writing should be on the back of the T-shirt. Pants must be navy blue gym-type shorts with an elastic waistband and drawstrings with the logo on the pant leg. All students must be prepared and able to remove their T-shirt for thoracic, cardiac, chest wall, and abdominal examinations. Therefore, female students must wear a sports bra beneath their T-shirt. Because of the nature of the exams, tank tops are not permitted in lieu of a sports bra. Athletic shoes and socks must be worn at all times in the lab, except as dictated by the instructor. Academic Promotions and Progression The progress of each student through the curriculum requires continuous, satisfactory academic and professional performance. No student may advance to the clinical year of study without satisfactorily completing all of the requirements for the didactic year's courses. In addition, no student may complete College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Physician Assistant Department, Fort Lauderdale 155 the clinical-year curriculum and graduate without satisfactorily completing all of the requirements for the clinical-year coursework. Any student failing a course or failing to exhibit satisfactory professional behavior will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress. (See information regarding the Committee on Student Progress in the Academic Standing section of this handbook.) Grading Policies and Procedures Grading for all PAC prefix courses is based on an alpha scale as shown. Required courses directed by the College of Medical Sciences department use a different scale outlined on their respective course syllabi. Alpha GradeA A- tuition will be charged for repeated courses. A student who is dismissed on the basis of inadequate academic performance may reapply to the program at a later time. The application will be treated in the same manner as a first-time applicant. Any student who is readmitted to the program will be considered a first-time student for the purposes of coursework and must repeat all required coursework, including courses completed previously. Incomplete Coursework The course director will determine the method by which an incomplete grade will be converted to an earned grade. When a student fails to complete all the requirements of a course or clinical rotation, the student shall receive a grade of I (incomplete). A change from an incomplete to an earned grade must occur within 90 days of having received the incomplete grade or the student's grade will be converted to an F . Academic Advising Each student is assigned an academic adviser at matriculation. The goal of an academic adviser is to provide students with assistance in attaining the most from their educational experiences; provide academic guidance, direction, and encouragement; monitor the overall progress; and identify appropriate resources. Each student in the academic and clinical year should meet with his or her adviser at least once a semester. Clinical Rotations The clinical year of the program is devoted to hands-on training in clinical rotations. The clinical year consists of nine required rotations: six core rotations and three elective rotations. Students must comply with all policies and procedures of both the clinical sites and NSU. 156 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Physician Assistant Department, Southwest Florida PA students on clinical rotations must maintain a functional cell phone at all times. To facilitate communications, PA students must provide the PA Program with their cell phone number and inform the program of any changes. During the clinical year, PA students will be required to document clinical experiences via a Web-based program. Students may elect to print out hard copies of the tracking tables and hand write these clinical experiences for input into the Web-based program at each day's end, or they may elect to purchase a laptop or tablet-device with wireless Internet connectivity and Webcam capability. Students will be given training on using the tracking software during the advanced didactic semester. Student organizations The Benjamin J. Parvin Physician Assistant Student Society of NSU is the department's formal student organization. This organization was established to benefit PA students, PA professionals, the college's PA department at Fort Lauderdale, and the surrounding communities. Each PA class also elects student representation within the Florida Academy of Physician Assistants and the American Academy of Physician Assistants. Additional Specific Policies Students will have readily available access to the department's academic and clinical year handbook that will cover respectively all policies, procedures, courses, and rotations appropriate for the curriculum. These handbooks provide more specifics for guidance and governance of the students while in the program. The College of Health Care Sciences Student Handbook supersedes the Fort Lauderdale PA program handbooks if there are direct conflicts, although the program's handbooks may be more strict and/or detailed. PHySICIAn A SSIS tAnt DePAR tment Southwest florida Dress Code Students in the NSU PA Program\u2014Southwest Florida are expected to comply with the dress code as outlined by the College of Health Care Sciences policy. Health professionals enjoy the respect of colleagues and patients largely due to their expertise, education, and performance. It has been shown that a degree of this respect comes from professional appearance and dress. To that end, the PA program has mandated a prescribed dress code for all PA students. The program has such a strong belief about professional dress, that a student can and will be sent home if not in proper attire. All coats, scrub suits, and dress attire should be neat, pressed, and cleaned as necessary to affect a profes - sional image and appearance. If staining does not permit complete cleaning, the clothing item should be immediately replaced. Initial purchase and subsequent replacement of any uniform items are the responsibility of the student. Dress shall be either Caribbean blue scrubs or medical business attire. Sandals and open-toed shoes are not permitted at any time in clinical or practical areas, physical assessment lab, patient simulation, or other clinical sites. Lab coats (short, intern style) with prescribed patches and embroidery must be worn when on the Fort Myers campus except when on the floor designated for the Physician Assistant Program. Lab coats are ordered during orientation week and will be received approximately one month later. College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Physician Assistant Department, Southwest Florida 157 Scrubs may be worn at any time. They shall be Caribbean blue with matching tops and bottoms. Gray lab T-shirts and lab shorts are NOT to be worn outside the physical diagnosis lab sessions. No patterned or other color scrubs are permitted. Drawstrings should be tied and tucked into the pants. Lab coats must be worn over scrubs. Athletic shoes may be worn with scrubs. Only white or gray colored T-shirts may be worn under scrubs in lecture halls and labs. Institutional, hospital, or clinic scrubs are NOT permitted at HPD. Institutional scrubs, as these are termed, are marked with the facility name. They are considered stolen property. Incidents will be handled as such. Physical exam (Physical Diagnosis) Lab Attire Students in the didactic phase of the curriculum will be required to wear a uniform for physical diagnosis lab. Students also may be required to wear this uniform during end-of-rotation seminars during the clinical year. This uniform will consist of T-shirt and shorts. The T-shirt will be a gray, short-sleeved T-shirt with the PA Program logo on the front of it. No logo or writing should be on the back of this T-shirt. Pants must be navy blue gym-type shorts with an elastic waistband and draw strings with the program logo on the pant leg. All students must be prepared and able to remove the T-shirt for thoracic, cardiac, or chest wall and abdominal examination at any time during physical examination labs. Therefore, female students must wear a sports bra or similar under attire beneath the T-shirt. Athletic shoes and socks must be worn at all times in the lab except as dictated by the instructor. The physical diagnosis uniform is permitted to be worn only in the physical diagnosis lab. Jewelry, Body Piercing, and tattoos Only appropriate jewelry for professional business attire is permitted. Visible body jewelry, such as rings for the nose, eyebrow, lip, chin, or tongue, is NOT permitted. Tattoos must be covered by clothing. Academic Promotions and Progression The progress of each student through the curriculum requires continuous, satisfactory academic perfor - mance. No student may advance to the clinical year of study without satisfactorily completing all of the didactic year's courses. In addition, no student may complete the clinical-year curriculum and graduate without satisfactorily completing all of the required clinical-year courses. Any student failing a course or failing to exhibit satisfactory professional behavior will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress(CPS). (See Committee on Student Progress in the college section of this handbook). The program's CSP meets at the end of each semester to review the progress of each student. The CSP makes recommendations to the program director/department chair (PD/DC) regarding the promotion of students. For students who are not promoted, the CSP may recommend any of the following: deceleration of the academic program, resulting in a delay of graduation repetition of the academic program, resulting in a delay of graduation dismissal from the program other appropriate actions The decision of the program director/department chair is conveyed to the student in writing during a face-to-face meeting. A copy of the decision letter is placed in the student's file. The student may appeal the decision as outlined in the college section of the handbook entitled Student Appeals.158 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Physician Assistant Department, Southwest Florida Grading Policies and Procedures Grading for academic and clinical-year PA students is based on an alpha scale as shown.

Clinical Rotations The clinical year of the program is devoted to hands-on training in clinical rotations. The clinical year consists of nine required rotations: six core rotations and three elective rotations. All core rotations must be completed in the state of Florida, primarily within 80-100 miles from NSU's Fort Myers Regional Campus. Each student should expect to complete at least one clinical rotation in a rural or underserved area. This will likely entail traveling beyond the 80-100 mile radius of Fort Myers. For core rotations assigned by the program outside of the 100-mile radius, housing will be provided for the students. During the clinical year, PA students will be required to document clinical experiences via a Web-based program. Students may elect to print out hard copies of the tracking tables and hand write these clinical experiences for input into the Web-based program at each day's end, or they may elect to purchase a laptop or tablet device with wireless Internet connectivity and Webcam capability. Students will be given training on using the tracking software during the advanced didactic semester. All PA students on clinical rotations must maintain a functional pager or cell phone at all times during their clinical rotations. This expense will be the student's responsibility.

Grading Policies and Procedures Grading for academic and clinical-year PA students is based on an alpha scale as shown. Alpha Grade AA- B+ courses, blocks, tests, retests, and remediation are graded in percentages with the final course grades converted to the alpha grade scale. For all classes, grades of less than 75 percent are failing grades and may result in additional testing, academic discipline, and/or possible dismissal. The syllabi of some courses define specific passing percentages for designated components. During the clinical year, the clinical rotation grade is composed of several individual components. Students must attain a passing grade on the end-of-rotation examination, as well as a passing cumula -160 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Physician Assistant Department, Jacksonville tive score on all components in order to pass the clinical rotation. Students receiving failing grades in clinical rotations following retesting will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress (CSP) for disposition.

Clinical rotations will likely entail traveling within an 80-100 mile radius of Jacksonville. For core rotations assigned by the program outside of the 100-mile radius, housing will be provided for the students at the college's expense.162 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Department of Health Science During the clinical year, PA students will be required to document clinical experiences via a Web-based program. Students may elect to print out hard copies of the tracking tables and hand write these clinical experiences for input into the Web-based program at each day's end, or they may elect to purchase an IBM-compatible laptop in order to electronically track the clinical experi - ences. All students will be given training on using the tracking software. To facilitate communications, PA students must provide the PA Program with their cell phone number and inform the program in advance of any changes. Students must comply with all policies and procedures of both the clinical sites and NSU. Additional Specific Policies Students will receive the department's academic and clinical year handbook that will cover respec - tively all policies, procedures, courses, and rotations appropriate for the curriculum. These handbooks provide more specifics for guidance and governance of the students while in the program. The College of Health Care Sciences Student Handbook supersedes the Jacksonville PA program handbooks if there are direct conflicts, although the program's handbooks may be more strict and/or detailed. DePAR tment of HeAL tH SCIenCe The Department of Health Science is an interdisciplinary group of programs offering educational oppor - tunities from entry-level undergraduate to postprofessional doctoral education. Offering three distance online programs at the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral levels for working health professionals and two on-campus courses of study (vascular sonography and anesthesiologist assistant), the Department of Health Science uses innovative online and on-campus components to achieve its mission of preparing professionals for today's health care market.

The Blackboard login can be accessed through the following Web address: https://sharklearn.nova.edu/webapps/login. email and Course Communication For online programs and courses, students will register for all classes online. In addition students need an NSU email account to access their courses and emails. Once students are officially accepted into the program, they must request an NSU email account online by visiting the NSU Office of Information Technology Web page at www.nova.edu/cwis/oit/services.html, clicking on the link \"Create Your Email\" and following the directions to request a new email account. All online students must use the Blackboard student center when communicating with their program. Course communication will be done through the particular course that the student is attending. A medical leave of absence is reviewed based on college policy. military Leave of Absence for online Programs Students in the military\u2014whether active, reserve, or National Guard\u2014desiring to take a leave of absence because of military deployment or changes in orders may request a leave of absence for the duration of the time indicated in their orders. In order to request military leave of absence the student must contact and supply the Department of Health Science Program Office with a copy of the orders. Because the B.H.Sc., M.H.Sc., D.H.Sc., and Ph.D. programs are distance based, students are encour - aged, if at all possible, to continue their studies. Students who have coursework in progress and request a military leave of absence will be given a grade of I (Incomplete) for the duration of their deployment. Upon the completion of military duty and return to the program, the student will have 90 days to complete the incomplete coursework. Academic Advising and Administrative Support Each student is required to contact the program director for academic advising prior to beginning the program. The program director and the department coordinator will advise and assist the student during their matriculation into the program. Students may communicate with the director and coordinator via phone, fax, email, or in person if they visit campus. Graduation Ceremonies Attendance of graduation ceremonies is not a requirement for distance education students. It is, however, an option that we encourage that takes place once a year. The graduate programs (Master of Health Science, Master of Science in Anesthesia, Doctor of Health Science, and Ph.D. in Health Science) graduate in August. The undergraduate programs (Bachelor of Health Science, Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Sonography and Bachelor of Science in Medical Sonography) graduate in May. Departmental Policies for All Health Science Programs textbooks Specific recommendations can and will be made by the program and individual professors. Students may purchase their books from any convenient source.164 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Department of Health Science Computer use See the NSU policy for Acceptable Use of Computing Resources. Program Leave of Absence The Department of Health Science programs follow the college policy on leave of absence. Incomplete Coursework A grade of incomplete (I ) is issued because of unexpected emergencies and must be made up within one semester following the final class date of the course, as stipulated by the course instructor and with approval of the program director. Students requesting extensions due to medical or military reasons are expected to provide official documentation. It is the student's responsibility to consult the instructor and submit the Incomplete Grade Agreement Form (download available in each student center) prior to the end of the course. The form must be signed by the student and the course instructor and approved by the program director. The student must have completed at least 50 percent of the assignments prior to course end and prior to requesting an incomplete grade. The instructor will not accept assignments received after the date indicated on the agreement, and the student's grade will be assigned according to the work the student completed by the end of the course. A grade of I cannot be given if less than 50 percent of the assignments have been completed by the official end date of the course. An incomplete grade that has not been changed by the official date in this agreement will be converted to an F by the program director and chair of the Department of Health Science. Dress Code When on the NSU campus during regular business hours (Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m.-5:00 p.m.) B.H.Sc., M.H.Sc., D.H.Sc., and Ph.D. in Health Science students are to comply with the Health Professions Division's dress code previously outlined in the Health Professions Division section of the student handbook. Students in the on-campus programs will also comply with the HPD dress code while on clinical rotations. Additional Departmental Policies for on-Campus Programs military Leave of Absence for on-Campus Programs Students in the military\u2014whether active, reserve or National Guard\u2014desiring to take a leave of absence because of military deployment or changes in orders may request a leave of absence for the duration of the time indicated in their orders. In order to request military leave of absence, the student must contact and supply the Department of Health Science and program director with a copy of his or her orders. As the B.H.Sc.\u2014Vascular Sonography and the M.H.Sc.\u2014Anesthesiologist Assistant are on-campus, lock-step specializations, students will be required to meet with the directors upon returning from leave in order to assess and determine the method in which they may continue their studies. Students who are in progress of coursework and require a military leave of absence will be given a grade of I (Incomplete) for the duration of their deployment and waiting period. Upon the comple- tion of military duty and return to the program, the student will be required to start at the beginning of the courses that were in progress at the time of his or her leave. Student Code of Conduct, Academic Dishonesty, Committee on Student Progress, and Student Disciplinary/Appeals Policies and Procedures The Health Science Department adheres to the Nova Southeastern University Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility, the College of Health Care Sciences Committee on Student Progress, the Academic Honesty Policy and Procedure, and the Student Appeals Policy and Procedure sections located in the university and college sections of this handbook. College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Bachelor of Health Science 165 Bachelor of Health Science\u2014online Degree Completion Program Because the Bachelor of Health Science (B.H.Sc.) Online Degree Completion Program is delivered in a distance format, not all of the policies contained in this handbook are applicable to B.H.Sc. students. Policies that are not covered in this section are addressed in previous sections of the handbook. The following policies are specific to Bachelor of Health Science Online Degree Completion Program students. Academic Promotions and Progression The progress of each student through the curriculum requires continuous satisfactory academic and professional performance. Substandard performance in any course or failing to exhibit satisfactory professional behavior will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress. (See the Committee on Student Progress in the college section of this handbook.) Academic Warning B.H.Sc. students whose semester GPA falls below 2.0 (regardless of the cumulative GPA), or who fail a course regardless of GPA may be given an academic warning. Attendance All of the B.H.Sc. courses are designed in distance learning formats. Each student holds the responsibility to fulfill all class requirements, access recommended resources, and meet the appropriate deadlines for assignment submission and exams. Students are required to access and participate in their Web-based class at least once per week in order to complete assignments. Grading Policies and Procedures Courses for the Bachelor of Health Science program are graded on an alpha scale. Alpha Grade A A-B+B B- C+C the B.H.Sc. program may use transcript notations outlined in the College of Health Care Sciences section of this handbook. Effective for new matriculants in or after January 2006, students will be required to obtain a grade of C or better (greater than or equal to 2.0 on a 4.0 scale) in every required core course. Students receiving a C-, D+, or D in a required core course will be required to take the course at its next scheduled offering. For purposes of retention in the B.H.Sc. online degree completion program, any core-course grade below a C will be considered a course failure. No more than two courses may be passed through remediation or retake. All students receiving a failing grade in a required core course will be required to remediate it by repeating the scheduled course and achieving a C or better at its next scheduled offering. Upon achieving a C or better in a repeated course, an E will be noted after the original grade, and that grade will then be exempt from GPA calculation. The new course grade will be noted on the transcript followed by an I indicating the new grade will be included in the GPA calculation. Additional tuition will be charged for any repeated course.166 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Bachelor of Health Science A student who has experienced two or more course failures while in the Bachelor of Health Science Program may be dismissed from the program. Any course failed on first taking will be considered a course failure. Passing a course through retake does not negate the original failure for purposes of retention in the program. transfer Credits Students who have earned college credits at other regionally accredited colleges or universities can transfer these credits into the B.H.Sc. program. Students should contact the B.H.Sc. admissions counselor to discuss how prior college credits can be used to obtain the B.H.Sc. degree. An evaluation of transfer credit will be completed prior to the first semester of enrollment, and applicable credit will be transferred based on all final official transcripts received. Students will be advised to take courses based on the official evaluation in their file. Transfer students must provide final official transcripts from all of their previous colleges; their previous academic work will then be evaluated. The B.H.Sc. program will transfer a maximum of 90 eligible semester credits (grades of C or better, GPA of 2.0 on a 4.0 grading scale), including credit for CLEP , proficiency exams, and prior experiential learning, toward a degree. To be eligible to graduate with the B.H.Sc. degree, a student must have completed the required general education coursework in addition to the B.H.Sc. curriculum, with a resulting minimum total of 120 semester hours with a 2.0 cumulative grade point average and a 2.25 grade point average in the B.H.Sc. major. If the general education requirement is not met at the time of admission to the program, it can be obtained concurrently while enrolled in the B.H.Sc. program. A student can obtain and transfer these courses through NSU's Farquhar College of Arts and Sciences or another regionally accredited college or university. Prior to matriculation, all applicants must have completed a minimum of three semesters hours (or the equivalent) of a college level written composition course from a regionally accredited college or university with a minimum grade of a C (GPA of 2.0 on a 4.0 grading scale). Students must complete a minimum of 25 percent (30 semester hours) of their coursework within the B.H.Sc. program major. Students with credits, health care or academic experiences, certificates, diplomas or degrees from nationally accredited colleges, military training, or other educational training/experiences should refer to the section below titled Assessment of Prior Experiences for Academic Credit in order to apply to convert these prior experiences in to academic credit. Assessment of Prior experiences for Academic Credit Students matriculated in the B.H.Sc. program may petition for transfer of credits to the program. Up to, and not exceeding, 90 credit hours may be considered for transfer from a regionally accredited or recognized allied health or related program. Students with either a diploma or certificate of completion in a field of health care may apply for credit based on prior experience by submitting a student prepared learning portfolio requesting Assessment of Prior Experiences for Academic Credit. Nova Southeastern University has established four different mechanisms for students to convert their prior experiences into academic credit. Students must initiate all requests for experiential learning credit before they complete 24 credits at NSU. Credits will be transcribed after 12 credits are successfully earned at NSU. For additional information, contact the B.H.Sc. Program or the Office of Transfer Evaluation Services at (954) 262-8414 or 800-356-0026, ext. 28414, or via email at miletsky@nsu.nova.edu. College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Bachelor of Health Science 167 1. CLEP/DANTES/ACT-PEP/Computer Test-Out Students can demonstrate their knowledge in a variety of areas by taking objective tests. The coordinator of experiential learning can provide further information about these tests as can the testing office in Academic Services. 2. Nationally Accredited School Portfolios Students who have attended nationally accredited institutions have the opportunity to write school portfolios. The coordinator of experiential learning works with each student in reviewing the student's nationally accredited institutional transcript to identify courses that may be applied toward his or her academic goal. 3. Full Portfolio-Course Challenge The full portfolio is the process for challenging a college-level course for credit. Through this mechanism, a student presents his or her knowledge on a topic and has it evaluated by a faculty member. A maximum of 25 percent of a student's credits may be earned through the full portfolio process. This will describe all traditional, online, military, and other health care education, as well as work-related experience and health care related conferences attended. A resume or CV , transcripts, and/or official documentation of attendance must accompany all prior learning portfolios. The admissions committee will review the portfolio to determine the amount of credit given for prior learning. 4. Standard Grant Certain training courses, military experiences, or licenses may be converted into college credit. This can be done by supplying some very basic documentation. For military training programs, the recommendations contained in the Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Forces from the American Council on Education will be utilized to evaluate such training for credit transfer. Examples include Combat Casualty and Flight Medicine Courses of training. Academic Advising and Administrative Support Students should contact the B.H.Sc. program director for academic advising. The program director and the department coordinator will advise and assist the student during matriculation and throughout his or her studies in the program. Students may communicate with the director and coordinator via the online B.H.Sc. student center, phone, or email. Administrative Support: 800-356-0026, ext. 21209, 21923, 21239 Academic Advising: (954) 288-9695 textbooks Specific recommendations can and will be made by the program and individual professors. Students may purchase their books from any convenient source. Add/Drop Students can add or drop courses on WebSTAR until the 10th calendar day from the beginning of the term. No academic or financial penalties will be accessed during that time frame. No grade notation will be entered on the transcript. No classes may be added or dropped after the 10th calendar day of the term. Dropping a course may affect the loans, scholarships, or grant aid that has been awarded prior to the drop. A student may have tuition refunded when dropping a course; however, this may cause a reduction in certain types of financial aid, which would possibly result in a balance due.168 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Bachelor of Health Science Withdrawal from a Course A request for withdrawal from a course shall be made in writing to the program director between the 11th and 20th days after the beginning of the class in which the student is enrolled. The student may request withdrawal only if he or she is in good standing. A withdrawal from a course requires approval from the program director. A grade of W (withdrawal) or WP (withdrawal passing) will be recorded. The grade of W or WP will be replaced by an earned grade only if the student retakes the course. Unofficial, late, or poor standing withdrawals may result in a grade of WF (withdrawal failing) or unearned F . Continuous enrollment Although continuous enrollment is not a requirement, the program strongly recommends that students enroll in at least two courses per semester for the duration of their B.H.Sc. studies. Administrative Withdrawals Unless prior approval or a leave of absence has been granted, students who do not enroll in any classes for two consecutive semesters may be administratively withdrawn (WU) from the B.H.Sc. program. If a student is administratively withdrawn from the program, he or she would be required to petition the program director in writing for reinstatement in the program. Program Leave of Absence A student desiring a voluntary leave of absence must first submit a written request to the program director, who will determine the time leave is granted and conditions under which the student may re-enter the program. military Leave of Absence Students in the military\u2014whether active, reserve, or National Guard\u2014who are required to take a leave of absence because of military deployment or changes in orders may request a leave of absence for the duration of the time indicated in their orders. To request military leave of absence, the student must contact and supply the B.H.Sc. Program Office with a copy of his or her orders. Because the B.H.Sc. program is distance based, students are encouraged, if at all possible, to continue their studies. Students who are in progress of coursework and request a military leave of absence will be given a grade of I (Incomplete) for the duration of their deployment. Upon the completion of military duty and return to the program, the student will have 90 days to complete the incomplete coursework. Dress Code When on the NSU campus during regular business hours (M-F , 8:30 a.m.-5:00 p.m.), B.H.Sc. students are to comply with the Health Professions Division's dress code previously outlined in the Health Professions Division section of the student handbook. Computer use The Department of Health Science defers to the controlling NSU university-wide policy on acceptable use of computing resources. email Since the B.H.Sc. program is an online program, students shall register for all classes online. In order to do so, students need an NSU email account. Once students are officially accepted into the program they should request an NSU email account online by going to the NSU Office of Information Technology page www.nova.edu/cwis/oit/services.html, clicking on the 'Create Your Email' link, and following the directions to request a new email account. College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Bachelor of Health Science 169 Course Registration and WebS tAR Once students have been accepted into the program, they will be issued, or can apply online for, a WebSTAR personal identification number (PIN) that will give them access to register online. The PIN also provides access to account information. Students can apply for their WebStar PIN by going to the NSU Office of Information Technology PIN Request Form Web page at https://www.nova.edu /webforms/help/pinreq.html and following the directions. B.H.Sc. students may only take BHS classes during winter, spring, summer II, and fall terms. However B.H.Sc. students may take any missing general education classes through NSU's Farquhar College of Arts and Sciences during any term in which they are offered. online Course Access and Blackboard All of the B.H.Sc. online courses which a student has registered for will be accessed through Blackboard. Students must use their NSU email login and password in order to log in to their courses posted on Blackboard. The Blackboard login can be accessed through the following https://sharklearn.nova.edu /webapps/login online Student Center\u2014Program and Course Communication All students are required to visit the online student center at least once every two weeks. All communication and programmatic information will be posted in the online student center. It is required that all B.H.Sc. students use the online student center when communicating with the program. All class communication must take place through the WebCT course itself. Graduation with Honors A student eligible for graduation with a cumulative grade point average of 3.8 or higher who has completed at least 54 credits at NSU is eligible to receive the degree with distinction. Degree candidates must complete all of the requirements as specified above. nondegree-Seeking Students A nondegree-seeking student is one who wishes to take coursework in the Bachelor of Health Science Program, but does not intend to pursue the B.H.Sc. degree at the time of application. The nondegree-seeking student must meet the following admission requirements in order to take classes in the B.H.Sc. program: a minimum of an associate's degree or equivalent credit hours in a field of health from a region- ally accredited college or university a diploma or certificate of completion in a field of health care Due to the limited number of seats available in the program, preference for admission and registration will be given to degree-seeking students. Nondegree-seeking students are limited to taking a maximum of 9 semester hours of B.H.Sc. course- work. Enrollment in these courses does not guarantee acceptance into the B.H.Sc. degree program or any other Nova Southeastern University program. If, after taking classes in the B.H.Sc. program, a nondegree-seeking student decides to pursue the B.H.Sc. degree, the student must resubmit an appli- cation to the program to be a degree-seeking student and must meet all the admission requirements for the B.H.Sc. degree program. A nondegree-seeking student who, after taking classes in the B.H.Sc. program, decides to apply to be a degree-seeking student may request a transfer of credits taken as a nondegree-seeking student in accordance with the transfer policy of the B.H.Sc. program. All applicants must show evidence of computer skills through coursework or self-study prior to the end of the first term. Students may obtain instruction through the NSU Student Microcomputer Laboratory or other training facilities.170 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014B.H.Sc.\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography/M.H.Sc.\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography Bachelor of Health Science\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography master of Health Science\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography (entering classes 2012 and 2013) This entry-level course of study is designed to prepare students in the field of cardiovascular sonography. The cardiovascular sonography program, both at the bachelor's and master's degree levels, includes on-campus lectures; extensive, hands-on training in our ultrasound laboratory; online courses; and a 12-month focused or combined externship in a clinical laboratory setting. The graduating student will earn either a bachelor's or master's degree in health science with a specialization in cardiovascular sonography, depending on the program completed. Students will take a combination of general courses in the health science field and focused core courses in the cardiovascular technology field. In the second year of the program, the student will complete a more than 1,600-hour clinical training program while continuing to take online courses. The student may have the option to perform his or her clinical externship in a vascular, adult echo, or combined vascular/echo clinical experience, based upon his or her interests and upon their demonstrated competencies in the didactic year. Upon graduation, the student will be eligible to sit for professional registry exams based upon completion of program and clinical requirements. Academic Promotions and Progression Academic progress: For each course offered within the program, contact information for that course will be available in the syllabus of the course. Students are strongly encouraged to consult with their professors and/or lab instructors regarding any issues affecting academic progress. Students are also strongly encouraged to contact the program director, if necessary. Academic progress in clinical externships: Clinical externships are assessed on criteria outlined in the syllabi for these courses. Failure to meet the requirements for any of these criteria may result in failure for the externship term, with similar consequences as for failure of any didactic course including possible dismissal from the program. Course Progression: The Bachelor of Health Science\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography and Master of Health Science\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography are lock-step programs. The sequence of the courses has been thoughtfully determined. Progression from one term to the next is based on the successful completion of the courses offered in prior terms. The progress of each student through the curriculum requires continuous satisfactory academic performance. In order to complete the cardiovascular sonography program, students must successfully complete the core cardiovascular courses in the time and sequence that they are offered. Retake/Repeat/Remediation Retake of incremental or individual quizzes or periodic exams (e.g, a midterm) throughout a given course is not mandated by the university, college, or program, and if available at all will be solely at the discretion of the course instructor who has final say in such matters. The following remediation policies apply only to final grade outcomes and final exams for an entire course. If a student fails a core cardiovascular course, a cumulative remediation of written and/or prac - tical examination will be administered at the end of the term. Grades on the transcript will be qualified to indicate a remediated course. A successful remediation will result in a final grade for the course not to exceed a minimum passing grade of a C on a grade-letter scale. While matriculating through the cardiovascular sonography program, each student is permitted to remediate a total of two core courses. A student will be allowed to sit for only one remediation examination per course. A final course grade of less than C in any given core cardiovascular course will constitute a course College of Health Care Sciences\u2014B.H.Sc.\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography/M.H.Sc.\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography 171 failure (this includes a grade achieved through a remediation examination). The grade from any remediation examination can be no lower than a C. Students in the B.H.Sc.\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography or M.H.Sc.\u2014 Cardiovascular Sonography program also take courses online. These courses do not offer remediation. A failure in one of the online courses means the course will need to be repeated at additional cost to the student and may delay graduation from the program. A student with one or more course failures will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress and may be dismissed from the program. Students who are dismissed on the basis of inadequate academic performance who wish to reenroll in the program will be required to reapply to the program in order to be considered for admission. The application will be treated in the same manner as a first-time applicant, under the admissions standards applicable to the next entering class. Any student who is readmitted to the program will be considered a first-time applicant for the purposes of coursework and must repeat all required coursework, including any courses completed previously, and will incur all course charges and expenses accordingly. Clinical externship courses cannot be remediated. If course requirements for that semester of clinical externship are not met by the end of the term, the externship may be extended as appropriate until satisfied, as determined by the program director. If upon completion of the extension period, the clinical requirements have still not been satisfied, the student will receive a failing grade for that course and be referred to the Committee on Student Progress and may be dismissed from the program. If a clinical preceptor, mentor, supervisor, or lab director requests that a student be removed from a clinical site, the student will be automatically suspended pending a hearing by the Committee on Student Progress, which may result in course failure and/or dismissal from the program for academic performance and/or unprofessional conduct (even without any prior failure on record). Students who are dismissed from the program on the basis of unprofessional conduct will not be consid - ered for reenrollment in the program. All rules regarding academic honesty, cheating, attendance, and professionalism apply to the clinical externship courses. Grading Policies and Procedures Courses for the Bachelor of Health Science and Master of Health Science with a specialization in Cardiovascular Sonography are graded on an alpha scale, following the grading standards of the college. Each student must pass all courses with a C or better in all required courses for the B.H.Sc.\u2014 Cardiovascular Sonography or the M.H.Sc.\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography degrees. Any grade lower than a C will result in failure of the course. Students receiving a failing grade will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress (CSP). Any failed course may need to be repeated and additional tuition will be charged, and may result in delay of progress through the program. Alpha Grade A A- B+ B B-C+ C FScale4.0 Incomplete Coursework For the M.H.Sc. program, a grade of incomplete ( I) is issued because of unexpected emergencies and must be made up within one month, based on instructor recommendation and program director approval. For the B.H.Sc. program, the student will have one semester to complete a course after the conditions of the incomplete have been agreed to, based on instructor recommendation and program director approval. Students requesting extensions due to medical or military reasons are expected to provide official documentation. It is the student's responsibility to consult the instructor and submit the Incomplete Grade Agreement Form (download available from the B.H.Sc. and M.H.Sc. student center) prior to the end of the course. The form must be signed by the student, instructor, and the program director. The student must have successfully completed at least 50 percent of the assignments prior to course end and prior to requesting an incomplete grade. The instructor will not accept assignments received after the date indicated on the agreement, and the student's grade will be assigned according to the work the student completed by that predetermined date. A grade of I cannot be given if less than 50 percent of the assignments have been completed by the official end date of the course. An incomplete grade that has not been changed by the official date in this agreement will be converted to an F by the administrative staff members of the Department of Health Science. Dress Code The cardiovascular sonography program complies with the College of Health Care Sciences' dress code. In addition, students in the didactic phase of the curriculum will be required to wear a uniform for training in the ultrasound teaching lab. Students also may be required to wear this uniform during end- of-rotation seminars within the clinical year. This uniform will include a gray, short-sleeved T-shirt, either plain or with the cardiovascular program or NSU logo on the front. No logo or writing should be on the back of the T-shirt. Pants must be navy blue, gym-type shorts with an elastic waistband and draw strings, either plain or with the program or NSU logo on the pant leg. All students must be prepared and able to remove the T-shirt for thoracic, cardiac, chest wall, and abdominal examination at any time during training in the ultrasound teaching lab. Therefore, females must wear a sports bra or similar under attire beneath the T-shirt. Athletic shoes and socks must be worn at all times in the lab, except as dictated by the instructor for specific training purposes. This uniform is permitted to be worn only in the ultrasound teaching lab. Upon leaving a lab session, unless immediately leaving the NSU campus for the day, the program-specific white clinical jackets must be worn and students should change back into normal professional attire as described above. Students in off-site clinical rotations must wear acceptable and professional attire consisting of clean and presentable matching scrub sets with appropriate closed-toe shoes and the program specific white clinical jackets at all times. Students must wear their approved NSU ID badges in plain view while on campus and on clinical rotations at all times. Students may not wear the following at any time either on campus or at a clinical externship location: shorts or cutoffs, miniskirts (higher than mid-thigh), jeans (all colors), see-through clothing or halter tops, sandals, flip-flops, or any other type of open-toed shoe; nonuniversity or nonprogram logo T-shirts (as the outer shirt), jogging or exercise clothing; any type of head-covering to include but not limited to hats, caps, scarves, shawls, or wraps of any kind, unless of a religious nature. College of Health Care Sciences\u2014B.H.Sc.\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography/M.H.Sc.\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography 173 Failure to comply with dress code policies is considered to be unprofessional behavior and may result in the student's placement on professional probation and/or further disciplinary action including referral to the Committee on Student Progress for unprofessional behavior. Students will be required to sign the Dress Code Policies Agreement form upon matriculation into the program, attesting to their understanding of and their agreement to follow all of the above dress code policies. Clinical externships and Assignment The second year of study in the Bachelor or Master of Health Science with a specialization in Cardiovascular Sonography consists of clinical externships. The student will be assigned an appro - priate clinical externship site. Student placement in an appropriate clinical site will be based upon their demonstrated understanding and competency in both the cardiac and vascular portions of their didactic coursework in year one, and upon the student's stated interests. A clinical externship site may thus consist of work in cardiac, vascular, or both types of clinical environments, accordingly. At any given campus location, there are a limited number of available local clinical externship sites. The university does, however, enjoy affiliation agreements for clinical externships with many excel - lent and renowned hospitals and learning facilities outside of the immediate campus area, across the state, region, and the country. For the second year of clinical externship experience, the student must be prepared to accept assign- ment to a clinical externship location that may be out of the immediate area of the NSU campus, out of the region, or even out of state. The student's initial clinical externship placement is assigned during the fourth term (summer) of the first year of study. Refusal of a clinical site assignment by a student is equivalent to a request for suspension and/or withdrawal from the program. The student may request a one-time hardship suspension of participation in the clinical externship portion of the program for one semester upon approval of a written request to the program director, and will be required to either resume their clinical externship the following semester, or be automatically administratively withdrawn from the program. Delay of the clinical externship, if granted, will not result in relief of the student's responsibility from other courses scheduled for that term (e.g., online courses) nor will it result in a tuition reduction or refund of any kind. Such delay, if approved, will result in the student not graduating with their original cadre of classmates and will delay the possible conferral of degree, and the student will be charged additional tuition for continuation. Students will be required to sign the Clinical Externship Policies Agreement form upon matriculation into the program, attesting to their understanding of and their agreement to follow all of the above clinical externship policies. Duties and expectations in Clinical externships The second year of study in the Bachelor or Master of Health Science with a specialization in Cardiovascular Sonography consists of clinical externships of three terms of approximately 16 weeks each, for a total of 48 weeks. The final clinical externship weekly schedule will be left at the discretion of the clinical site and the student, but must follow the guideline of 36 hours a week minimum for the three 16-week sessions, for a total of 48 weeks. Students in clinical externships must follow all the rules and regulations of both the university and the clinical site, including but not restricted to, rules and regulations on confidentiality, job safety, dress code, attendance, and daily work activities. 174 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014B.H.Sc.\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography/M.H.Sc.\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography Students in off-site clinical placements will be required to comply with all the special requirements of the facility. These requirements may include, but are not limited to, fingerprinting, proof of vaccina- tions, proof of insurance, and drug screening. The college does not assume any responsibility other than informing the student of the requirements. The student must fully comply with all requirements of the specific facility before participating in any activities at that facility. Failure to be eligible to participate in activities at an assigned facility may result in the student not being allowed to complete that clinical externship and may result in disciplinary action. Absences or tardiness from the clinical externship site should be communicated verbally or in writing (including email) directly to the program clinical coordinator and the clinical instructor in the clinical site, preferably before the start of the shift assigned, but no later than the same day. Text messages, postings to the course, or other nonverbal communications are not acceptable. To facilitate communication between the student and the program during the clinical externships, the student must provide a cellular phone number to the program clinical coordinator. The expense of the cellular phone and its function will be the student's responsibility. Clinical documentation, including clinical hours, is completed through the clinical reporting system, Trajecsys. The student will be given instructions on the use of the system prior to the first day in the clinical externship site. The student will be given a building code and an ID number, as well as instruc - tions on the use of the system prior to the first day in the clinical externship site. Any student believed to be tampering with or manipulating the clock-in, clock-out, or documentation process will be sent to the Committee on Student Progress and may be subject to disciplinary action for unethical and unprofessional behavior including, but not limited to, receiving a failing grade for the clinical rotation. Failure to meet clinical rotation obligations is considered to be unethical and unprofessional behavior and may result in the student's placement on professional probation and/or further disciplinary action. Clinical extension of Program If, for any reason, the student does not fulfill the requirements for a clinical externship course due to excessive absences, poor clinical evaluations and/or performance, or other reasons, the program has the authority to extend the student's clinical externship, which will result in additional cost to the student and delay in degree progress. (Please also refer to the section on Academic Promotions and Progression.) Patient safety is paramount. Any issues pertaining to student progress that are related to patient safety may supersede any policies and procedures on student progress. Students will be required to sign the Clinical Externship Policies Agreement form upon matriculation into the program, attesting to their understanding of and their agreement to follow all of the above clinical externship policies. electronic Communications Electronic communications, including faxes and electronic mail, must adhere to the university policy. Work submitted as part of class assignments during any didactic or clinical externship courses should not include any identifying information on the patient in conformance with HIPAA regulations. Students may be videotaped in certain academic classes and clinical labs for teaching-learning purposes. Students must sign a release form for videotaping at the time of registration. Students should obtain permission from instructors to videotape or audiotape lectures. Verbal permission is acceptable. To facilitate communication between the student and the program during the clinical externships, the student must provide a cellular phone number to the program clinical coordinator. The expense of the cellular phone and its function will be the student's responsibility. College of Health Care Sciences\u2014B.H.Sc.\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography/M.H.Sc.\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography 175 Computer Requirements All students are required to have access to a computer (PC or Apple equivalent) with the following minimum specifications: AMD or Intel dual-core processor Windows 7 or better 4 GB RAM 250 GB hard-drive CD-ROM drive (read-write) USB port high-speed Internet connection (cable, DSL, etc., 100 Mb/second or better) graphics printing capability video Web camera with microphone capability The expense of the computer and its connectivity and function will be the student's responsibility. training Laboratory 1. Foreword: The core sonography courses in the program have been developed to include a large and crucial hands-on training component in the program's ultrasound training laboratory. This model offers a considerable benefit to the learning process and acquisition of technical skills by the student before the start of clinical externships during the second year of study. The program strives to equip the student with fundamental skills and exam techniques through the use of state-of-the-art equip- ment for the acquisition of examination information. The program also ensures that the training environment in the ultrasound training laboratory is safe and that all students obtain the training benefits in an equitable manner. 2. Technical Standards: The profession of diagnostic medical sonographer includes, but is not limited to, the following physical, mental, auditory, and visual demands a. physical\u2014the ability to lift 50 pounds of weight, the ability to reach up, the ability to stand for up to 80 percent of the time, the ability to push or pull equipment and other devices such as wheelchairs or stretchers, and the manual dexterity to control the settings on computers and on the ultrasound equipment b. mental\u2014the ability to remember, recall, and analyze information; the ability to work in a noisy environment; the ability to remain focused despite interruptions; and the ability to cope with potentially stressful situations c. auditory\u2014the ability to hear from both ears within normal auditory range and the ability to distin - guish sounds within normal hearing range d. visual\u2014the ability to distinguish colors, the ability to monitor the environment, and the ability to work in dimmed light 3. Rules in the Use of the Training Laboratory: As previously outlined, the ultrasound training labora - tory and its extensive use during the didactic portion of study within the Bachelor of Health Science or Master of Health Science with a specialization in Cardiovascular Sonography is an essential and critical component of the program. a. Conduct in the ultrasound training laboratory will follow the rules and policies outlined for the university and the college in an effort to create an environment adequate to foster optimal learning. b. Food and drink will not be allowed in the ultrasound training laboratory (a capped bottle of beverage can be kept with the student's personal belongings and used during the breaks outside the laboratory).176 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Bachelor of Science\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography c. The use of the ultrasound training laboratory will be strictly reserved to training sessions outlined by one of the professors and will be supervised by one of the professors. Students are not allowed in the lab unless supervised by a professor or instructor. d. A copy of the specific rules and regulations pertaining to teaching in the ultrasound training lab will be provided at the first lab session in the first term on campus in the program. The rules will be explained by the professor assigned to the class. All students will sign a copy. e. Safeguards\u2014Instruction sessions in the ultrasound training laboratory are made possible by the participation of students, both as the person scanning and the person being scanned (subject). All the exercises are developed to ensure prudent and safe use of the equipment, as well as the safety of the subject. 4. Participation and Equitable Training: The hands-on training in the lab by necessity consists of students practicing on each other, taking turns as designated \"examiner\" and as the \"patient.\" Participation in the role of \"patient\" for a given lab course or session is voluntary. Election not to participate will not affect grades directly. However, a student electing to not participate as a \"patient\" does not get to enjoy the benefit of training as an examiner on their fellow students, and will be required to provide their own patient model at their own expense to participate in the course. Accreditation The Cardiovascular Sonography program is a new offering at NSU. The program will be eligible for accreditation by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP) after the first graduating class. online Course Access, Blackboard, and nSu email All of the B.H.Sc.\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography and M.H.Sc.\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography courses that a student has registered for, both purely online and classroom/lab-based courses, will be accessed through the Blackboard online learning environment. Students must use their NSU email login and password in order to log in to their courses posted on Blackboard. Orientation to the online Blackboard learning environment will be provided to students in the first semester, and its online assistance and tutorials are available at any time through the University Office of Information Technology and the SharkLink student portal. In addition, it is the students' responsibility and is mandatory that students regularly check their NSU provided email accounts for important communications from both their course instructors and the university in general. Bachelor of Science\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography (entering class 2014 and future classes) This entry-level course of study is designed to prepare students in the field of cardiovascular sonography. The cardiovascular sonography program includes on-campus lectures; extensive, hands-on training in our ultrasound laboratory; online courses; and a 12-month focused or combined externship in a clinical laboratory setting. The graduating student will earn a Bachelor of Science degree in Cardiovascular Sonography (B.S.\u2014 CVS). Students will take a combination of general courses in the health science field and focused core courses in the cardiovascular technology field. In the second year of the program, the student will complete a more than 1,600-hour clinical training program while continuing to take online courses. The student may have the option to perform his or her clinical externship in a vascular, adult echo, or combined vascular/echo clinical experience, based upon his or her interests and upon their demonstrated competencies in the didactic year. Upon graduation, the student will be eligible to sit for professional registry exams based upon completion of program and clinical requirements. College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Bachelor of Science\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography 177 Academic Promotions and Progression Academic progress: For each course offered within the program, contact information for that course will be available in the syllabus of the course. Students are strongly encouraged to consult with their professors and/or lab instructors regarding any issues affecting academic progress. Students are also strongly encouraged to contact the program director, if necessary. Academic progress in clinical externships: Clinical externships are assessed on criteria outlined in the syllabi for these courses. Failure to meet the requirements for any of these criteria may result in failure for the externship term, with similar consequences as for failure of any didactic course including possible dismissal from the program. Course progression: The Bachelor of Science\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography is a lock-step program. The sequence of the courses has been thoughtfully determined. Progression from one term to the next is based on the successful completion of the courses offered in prior terms. The progress of each student through the curriculum requires continuous satisfactory academic performance. In order to complete the sonography program, students must successfully complete the core sonog- raphy courses in the time and sequence that they are offered. Students who receive a final course grade of F in any core sonography didactic course will not be allowed to progress to the next semester and will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress and may be dismissed from the program. The following are considered core courses: Physics Ultrasound I, Introduction to Ultrasound, Cross-Sectional Anatomy, Abdominal Sonography I, Ob-Gyn Sonography I, Small Parts Ultrasound, Venous and Arterial Ultrasound Testing, and Cerebrovascular Ultrasound Testing. Retake/Repeat/Remediation Retake of incremental or individual quizzes or periodic exams (e.g, a midterm) throughout a given course is not mandated by the university, college, or program, and if available will be solely at the discretion of the course instructor who has final say in such matters. The following remediation policies apply only to final grade outcomes and final exams for an entire course. If a student fails a core cardiovascular course, a cumulative remediation of written and/or practical examination will be administered at the end of the term. Grades on the transcript will be quali- fied to indicate a remediated course. A successful remediation will result in a final grade for the course not to exceed a minimum passing grade of a C on an alpha scale. While matriculating through the cardiovascular sonography program, each student is permitted to remediate a total of two core courses. A student will be allowed to sit for only one remediation examination per course. A final course grade of less than C in any given core cardiovascular course will constitute a course failure (this includes a grade achieved through a remediation examination). The grade from any remediation examination can be no lower than a C. Students in the B.S.\u2014CVS program also take courses online. These courses do not offer remediation. A failure in one of the online courses means the course will need to be repeated at additional cost to the student and may delay graduation from the program. A student with one or more course failures will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress and may be dismissed from the program. Students who are dismissed on the basis of inadequate academic performance who wish to reenroll in the program will be required to reapply to the program in order to be considered for admission. The application will be treated in the same manner as a first-time applicant, under the admissions standards applicable to the next entering class. Any student who is readmitted to the program will be considered a first-time applicant for the purposes of coursework and must repeat all required coursework, including any courses completed previously, and will incur all course charges and expenses accordingly.178 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Bachelor of Science\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography Clinical externship courses cannot be remediated. If course requirements for that semester of clinical externship are not met by the end of the term, the externship may be extended as appro - priate until satisfied, as determined by the program director. If upon completion of the extension period, the clinical requirements have still not been satisfied, the student will receive a failing grade for that course and will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress and may be dismissed from the program. If a clinical preceptor, mentor, supervisor, or lab director requests that a student be removed from a clinical site, the student will be automatically suspended pending a hearing by the Committee on Student Progress, which may result in course failure and/or dismissal from the program for academic performance and/or unprofessional conduct (even without any prior failure on record). Students who are dismissed from the program on the basis of unprofessional conduct will not be consid - ered for reenrollment in the program. All guidelines regarding academic honesty, cheating, attendance, and professionalism apply to the clinical externship courses. Grading Policies and Procedures Courses for the Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Sonography are graded on an alpha scale, following the grading standards of the college. Each student must pass all courses with a C or better in all required courses for the B.S.\u2014CVS degree. Any grade lower than a C will result in failure of the course. Students receiving a failing grade will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress (CSP). Any failed course may need to be repeated and additional tuition will be charged, and may result in delay of progress through the program. Alpha Grade A A-B+B B- C+ C B.S.\u2014CVS program, the student will have one semester to complete a course after the condi - tions of the incomplete have been agreed to, based on instructor recommendation and program director approval. Students requesting extensions due to medical or military reasons are expected to provide official documentation. It is the student's responsibility to consult the instructor and submit the Incomplete Grade Agreement Form (download available from the B.H.Sc. and M.H.Sc. Student Center) prior to the end of the course. The form must be signed by the student, instructor, and the program director. The student must have successfully completed at least 50 percent of the assignments prior to course end and prior to requesting an incomplete grade. The instructor will not accept assignments received after the date indicated on the agreement, and the student's grade will be assigned according to the work the student completed by that predetermined date. A grade of I cannot be given if less than 50 percent of the assignments have been completed by the official end date of the course. An incomplete grade that has not been changed by the official date in this agreement will be converted to an F by the administrative staff members of the Department of Health Science. College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Bachelor of Science\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography 179 Dress Code The cardiovascular sonography program complies with the College of Health Care Sciences' dress code. In addition, students in the didactic phase of the curriculum will be required to wear a uniform for training in the ultrasound teaching lab. Students also may be required to wear this uniform during end- of-rotation seminars within the clinical year. This uniform will include a gray, short-sleeved T-shirt, either plain or with the cardiovascular program or NSU logo on the front. No logo or writing should be on the back of the T-shirt. Pants must be navy blue, gym-type shorts with an elastic waistband and drawstrings, either plain or with the program or NSU logo on the pant leg. All students must be prepared and able to remove the T-shirt for thoracic, cardiac, chest wall, and abdominal examination at any time during training in the ultrasound teaching lab. Therefore, females must wear a sports bra or similar under attire beneath the T-shirt. Athletic shoes and socks must be worn at all times in the lab, except as dictated by the instructor for specific training purposes. This uniform is permitted to be worn only in the ultrasound teaching lab. Upon leaving a lab session, unless immediately leaving the NSU campus for the day, the program-specific white clinical jackets must be worn and students should change back into normal professional attire as described above. Students in off-site clinical rotations must wear acceptable and professional attire consisting of clean and presentable matching scrub sets with appropriate closed-toe shoes and the program specific white clinical jackets at all times. Students must wear their approved NSU ID badges in plain view while on campus and on clinical rotations at all times. Students may not wear the following at any time either on campus or at a clinical externship location: shorts or cutoffs, miniskirts (higher than mid-thigh), jeans (all colors), see-through clothing or halter tops, sandals, flip-flops, or any other type of open-toed shoe; non-university or non-program logo T-shirts (as the outer shirt), jogging or exercise clothing; any type of head-covering to include but not limited to hats, caps, scarves, shawls, or wraps of any kind, unless of a religious nature. Failure to comply with dress code policies is considered to be unprofessional behavior and may result in the student's placement on professional probation and/or further disciplinary action including referral to the Committee on Student Progress for unprofessional behavior. Students will be required to sign the Dress Code Policies Agreement form upon matriculation into the program, attesting to their understanding of and their agreement to follow all of the above dress code policies. Clinical externships and Assignment The second year of study in the Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Sonography program consists of clinical externships. The student will be assigned an appropriate clinical externship site. Student placement in an appropriate clinical site will be based upon their demonstrated understanding and competency in both the cardiac and vascular portions of their didactic coursework in year one, and upon the student's stated interests. A clinical externship site may thus consist of work in cardiac, vascular, or both types of clinical environments, accordingly. At any given campus location, there are a limited number of available local clinical externship sites. The university does, however, enjoy affiliation agreements for clinical externships with many excel- lent and renowned hospitals and learning facilities outside of the immediate campus area, across the state, region, and the country.180 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Bachelor of Science\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography For the second year of clinical externship experience, the student must be prepared to accept assign- ment to a clinical externship location that may be out of the immediate area of the NSU campus, out of the region, or even out of state.

The classroom and lab-based courses, including the clinical externships, are on a three-term calendar. Academic Promotions and Progression Honors: The students may receive academic honors per term based on the completed work for the term. The policy for dean's or chancellor's lists follows that in place for the College of Health Care Sciences. A notice will be sent to the student and notification will be entered on his or her transcript. Academic Progress: For each course offered within the program, contact information for the designated contact person for that course will be available in the syllabus of the course. Students are strongly encouraged to consult with their professors or lab instructors regarding any issues impeding academic progress. Students are also strongly encouraged to contact the program director, if necessary. Academic Progress in Clinical Externships: Clinical externships are assessed on different criteria outlined in the syllabi for these courses. Failure to meet the requirements for any of these criteria may result in failure for the externship, with similar consequences as for failure of any didactic courses including, but not limited to, possible dismissal from the program. Academic Progression: The Bachelor of Science in Medical Sonography is a lock-step program. 184 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Bachelor of Science\u2014Medical Sonography The sequence of the courses has been thoughtfully determined. Progression from one term to the next is, for sonography courses, based on the successful completion of the courses offered in prior terms. The progress of each student through the curriculum requires continuous satisfac - tory academic performance. In order to fully complete the sonography program, students must successfully complete the core sonography courses in the time and sequence that they are offered. Students who receive a final course grade of F in any core didactic course will not be allowed to progress to the next semester and will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress and may be dismissed from the program. The following are considered core courses: Physics Ultrasound I, Introduction to Ultrasound, Cross-Sectional Anatomy, Abdominal Sonography I, Ob-Gyn Sonography I, Small Parts Ultrasound, Venous and Arterial Ultrasound Testing, and Cerebrovascular Ultrasound Testing. Retake/Repeat/Remediation If a student fails a core sonography course, a cumulative remediation of written and/or practical examination will be administered. Grades on the transcript will be qualified to indicate a repeated course or a remediation examination. A final course grade of less than C in any given core sonography course will constitute a course failure (this includes a grade achieved through a remediation examination). The grade from a remediation examination can be no lower than a C. Students who fail a core sonography course and the remediation examination will be sent to the Committee on Student Progress with recom- mendation and may be dismissed. While matriculating through the Bachelor of Science in Medical Sonography program, each student is permitted to remediate a total of two core courses. A student will be allowed to sit for only one remediation examination per course. Students in the B.S.\u2014MS program also take courses online. These courses do not offer remediation. A failure in one of the online courses means the course will need to be repeated at additional cost to the student and may delay graduation from the program. A student with one or more course failures will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress and may be dismissed from the program. A student who is dismissed on the basis of inadequate academic performance who wishes to reenroll in the program will be required to reapply to the program in order to be considered for admission. The application will be treated in the same manner as a first-time applicant, under the admissions standards applicable to the next entering class. Any student who is readmitted to the program will be considered a first-time applicant for the purposes of coursework and must repeat all required coursework, including any courses completed previously, and will incur all course charges and expenses accordingly. Clinical externship courses cannot be remediated. If course requirements for that semester of clinical externship are not met by the end of the term, the externship may be extended as appro - priate until satisfied, as determined by the program director. If upon completion of the extension period, the clinical requirements have still not been satisfied, the student will receive a failing grade for that course and will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress and may be dismissed from the program. If a clinical preceptor, mentor, supervisor, or lab director requests that a student be removed from a clinical site, the student will be automatically suspended pending a hearing by the Committee on Student Progress, which may result in course failure and/or dismissal from the program for academic performance and/or unprofessional conduct (even without any prior failure on record). Students who are dismissed from the program on the basis of unprofessional conduct will not be consid - ered for reenrollment in the program. All guidelines regarding academic honesty, cheating, attendance, and professionalism apply to the clinical externship courses. College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Bachelor of Science\u2014Medical Sonography 185 Grading Policies and Procedures Alpha Grade A A- B+B B- C+ C FScale4.0 75-76 Courses for the Bachelor of Science in Medical Sonography are graded on an alpha scale (described above). Students must pass all courses with a grade of C or better. Any grade lower than a C will result in failure of the course. Students receiving a failing grade will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress (CSP). Any failed course may need to be repeated and additional tuition will be charged. Any single core course will be cause for referral to the CSP and may be cause for dismissal from the program. Graduation with Honors\u2014B.S.\u2014mS A student eligible for graduation with a cumulative grade point average of 3.8 or higher who has completed at least 90 credits at NSU is eligible to receive the degree with distinction. Incomplete Coursework For the B.S.\u2014MS program, a grade of incomplete (I ) is issued because of unexpected emergencies and must be made up within one month, based on instructor recommendation and program director approval. For the B.S.\u2014MS program, the student will have one semester to complete a course after the conditions of the incomplete have been agreed to, based on instructor recommendation and program director approval. Students requesting extensions due to medical or military reasons are expected to provide official documentation. It is the student's responsibility to consult the instructor and submit the Incomplete Grade Agreement Form (download available from the B.S.\u2014MS. Student Center) prior to the end of the course. The form must be signed by the student, instructor, and the B.S.\u2014MS program director. The student must have successfully completed 50 percent of the assignments prior to course end and prior to requesting an incomplete grade. The instructor will not accept assignments received after the date indicated on the agreement, and the student's grade will be assigned according to the work the student completed by the end of the course. A grade of I cannot be given if less than 50 percent of the assignments have been completed by the official end date of the course. An incomplete grade that has not been changed by the official date in this agreement will be converted to an F by the administrative staff members of the Department of Health Science. Clinical externships Clinical externships time frame: The second year of study in the Bachelor of Science in Medical Sonography program consists of clinical externships, i.e., courses designated as BHS 4500, 4600, and 4700. These externship timeframes follow the ARDMS (American Registry for Diagnostic Medical Sonography) guidelines, and consist of 3 sessions for a total of 48 weeks, with a minimum of 37 hours per week. Clinical externships placement: The student's initial clinical externship placement is assigned during the third term (summer) of the first year of study. The final clinical externship weekly schedule will be left at the discretion of the clinical site and the student, but must follow the guidelines outlined above. Students who have not taken the Sonography Principles and Instrumentations (SPI) Exam with the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonography (ARDMS) will not be able to start 186 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Bachelor of Science\u2014Medical Sonography their clinical externships. Duties and expectations in clinical externships: Students in clinical externships must follow all the rules and regulations of the university and the clinical site, including but not restricted to, rules and regulations on confidentiality. Written work submitted as part of class assignments should not include any identifying information on the patient. To facilitate communication between the student and the program during the clinical externships, the student must provide a cellular phone number to the clinical coordinator. The expense of the cellular phone and its function will be the student's responsibility. Absences or tardiness from the clinical externship site should be communicated to the clinical coordinator AND the clinical instructor in the clinical site, preferably before the start of the shift assigned, but no later than 24 hours. Time keeping: Time keeping during clinical externships is done through Chronotek\u2014an auto - mated telephone system subcontracted by the program. The student will be given a building code and an ID number, as well as instructions on the use of the system prior to his or her first day in the clinical externship site. Any student found to be tampering with or manipulating the documenta\u00action process may receive disciplinary action and/or fail the clinical rotation. Clinical extension of program: If, for any reason, the student does not fulfill the requirements for clinical externships (BHS 4500, 4600, and 4700), the program has the authority to extend the student's clinical externships, which may result in additional cost to the student. Please also refer to the section on Academic Promotions and Progression. electronic Communication Electronic communication, including faxes and electronic mail, must adhere to the university policy. The use of cellular phones and other unauthorized electronic devices are not permitted during the lectures or lab sessions. Students may be requested to step out of the auditorium or the laboratory if the student uses a cellular phone or any other unauthorized electronic device without authorization from the instructor. Recurrent behavior will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress for unprofessional behavior. Clinical Site Requirements Students in off-site clinical sites will be required to comply with all the special requirements of the facility. These requirements may include, but are not limited to, fingerprinting, proof of vaccinations, proof of insurance, and so on. The college does not assume any responsibility, other than informing the student of the requirements. The student must fully comply with all requirements of the specific facility before participating in any activities at that facility. Failure to be eligible to participate in activities at an assigned facility may result in the student not being allowed to complete that clinical experience; in that case, the student will be reassigned to another clinical rotation, if possible. Students may be videotaped in certain academic classes and clinical labs for teaching-learning purposes. Students must sign a release form for videotaping at the time of registration. Students should obtain permission from instructors to videotape or audiotape lectures. Verbal permission is acceptable. training Laboratory 1. Foreword: Most of the core sonography courses in the program have been developed to include a large and crucial hands-on training component in the program's ultrasound training laboratory. This model offers a considerable benefit to the learning process of technical skills before students start clinical externships during the second year of study. The program strives to expose the students to state-of- the-art equipment for the acquisition of these skills. The program also ensures that the environment in the ultrasound training laboratory is safe. Extracurricular lab sessions are mandatory as they are College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Bachelor of Science\u2014Medical Sonography 187 oriented to refine technical skills and prepare students for their clinical externships.

The grade from a remediation examination can be no lower than a C . Students who fail a core vascular course and the remediation examination will be sent to the Committee on Student Progress and may be dismissed. While matriculating through the vascular sonography program, each student is permitted to remediate a total of two core courses. A student will be allowed to sit for only one remediation examination per course. Students in the B.H.Sc.\u2014Vascular Sonography or M.H.Sc.\u2014Vascular Sonography program also take courses online. These courses do not offer remediation. A failure in one of the online courses means the course will need to be repeated at additional cost and may delay graduation from the program. A student with two or more course failures will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress and may be dismissed. A student who is dismissed on the basis of inadequate academic performance or unprofessional conduct will be required to reapply to the program in order to be considered for readmission under the admissions standards applicable to the next class. The application will be treated in the same manner as a first-time applicant. Any student who is readmitted to the program will be considered a first-time applicant for the purposes of coursework and must repeat all required coursework, including courses completed previously. Clinical Courses\u2014the following applies to the clinical externship courses (BSV 4500, 4600, and 4700): None of these courses can be remediated. If requirements are not met by the end of the course, the externship will be extended as appropriate, as determined by the program director. If a preceptor or supervisor requests that a student be removed from a clinical site, the student will be automatically suspended pending a hearing by the Committee on Student Progress, which may result in course failure and/or dismissal from the program (even without any prior failure on record). All other rules regarding academic honesty, cheating, attendance, and professionalism apply to the clinical externship courses. Grading Policies and Procedures Courses for the Bachelor and Master of Health Science with a Specialization in Vascular Sonography are graded on an alpha scale (described below). Students must pass all courses with a grade of C or better. Any grade lower than a C will result in failure of the course. Students receiving a failing grade will be College of Health Care Sciences\u2014B.H.Sc.\u2014Vascular Sonography/M.H.Sc.\u2014Vascular Sonography 195 referred to the Committee on Student Progress (CSP). Any failed course may need to be repeated and additional tuition will be charged. Alpha Grade A A-B+ B B- C+ 75-760-74 Each student must pass all courses with a C or better in all required courses for the B.H.Sc.\u2014Vascular Sonography or the M.H.Sc.\u2014Vascular Sonography degree. Graduation with Honors\u2014B.H.Sc. A student eligible for graduation with a cumulative grade point average of 3.8 or higher who has completed at least 90 credits at NSU is eligible to receive the degree with distinction. Graduation with Honors\u2014m.H.Sc. A student eligible for graduation with a cumulative grade point average of 3.74 or higher is eligible to receive the degree with honors. A student eligible for graduation with a cumulative grade point average of 4.0 is eligible to receive the degree with high honors. Incomplete Coursework For the M.H.Sc. program, a grade of incomplete (I ) is issued because of unexpected emergencies and must be made up within one month, based on instructor recommendation and program director approval. For the B.H.Sc. program, the student will have one semester to complete a course after the conditions of the incomplete have been agreed to, based on instructor recommendation and program director approval. Students requesting extensions due to medical or military reasons are expected to provide official documentation. It is the student's responsibility to consult the instructor and submit the Incomplete Grade Agreement Form (download available from the B.H.Sc. and M.H.Sc. Student Center) prior to the end of the course. The form must be signed by the student, instructor, and the B.H.Sc. or M.H.Sc. program director. The student must have successfully completed 50 percent of the assignments prior to course end and prior to requesting an incomplete grade. The instructor will not accept assignments received after the date indicated on the agreement, and the student's grade will be assigned according to the work the student completed by the end of the course. A grade of I cannot be given if less than 50 percent of the assignments have been completed by the official end date of the course. An incomplete grade that has not been changed by the official date in this agreement will be converted to an F by the administrative staff members of the Department of Health Science. Clinical externships Clinical externships timeframe: The second year of study in the Bachelor or Master of Health Science with a specialization in Vascular Sonography consists of clinical externships, i.e., courses designated as BSV 4500, 4600, and 4700. These externship timeframes follow the ARDMS (American Registry for Diagnostic Medical Sonography) guidelines, and consist of three sessions of 16 weeks each (for a total of 48 weeks), with a minimum of 35 hours per week. Clinical externships placement: The student's initial clinical externship placement is assigned during the third term (summer) of the first year of study. The final clinical externship weekly 196 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014B.H.Sc.\u2014Vascular Sonography/M.H.Sc.\u2014Vascular Sonography schedule will be left at the discretion of the clinical site and the student, but following the guide - lines outlined above (35 hours/week minimum for three 16-week sessions). Duties and expectations in clinical externships: Students in clinical externships must follow all the rules and regulations of the university and the clinical site, including but not restricted to, rules and regulations on confidentiality. Written work submitted as part of class assignments should not include any identifying information on the patient. To facilitate communication between the student and the program during the clinical externships, the student must provide a cellular phone number to the clinical coordinator. The expense of the cellular phone and its function will be the student's responsibility. Absences or tardiness from the clinical externship site should be communicated to the clinical coordinator AND the clinical instructor in the clinical site, preferably before the start of the shift assigned, but no later than 24 hours. Time keeping: Time keeping during clinical externships is done through Chronotek. Chronotek is an automated telephone system subcontracted by the program. The student will be given a building code and an ID number, as well as instructions on the use of the system prior to his or her first day in the clinical externship site. Any student found to be tampering with or manipu - lating the documentation process may receive disciplinary action and/or fail the clinical rotation. Clinical extension of program: If, for any reason, the student does not fulfill the requirements for clinical externships (BSV 4500, 4600, and 4700), the program has the authority to extend the student's clinical externships, which may result in additional cost to the student. Please also refer to the section on Academic Promotions and Progression. electronic Communication Electronic communication, including faxes and electronic mail, must adhere to the university policy. Students in off-site clinical sites will be required to comply with all the special require - ments of the facility. These requirements may include, but are not limited to, fingerprinting, proof of vaccinations, proof of insurance, and so on. The college does not assume any responsibility, other than informing the student of the requirements. The student must fully comply with all requirements of the specific facility before participating in any activities at that facility. Failure to be eligible to participate in activities at an assigned facility may result in the student not being allowed to complete that clinical experience; in that case, the student will be reassigned to another clinical rotation, if possible. Students may be videotaped in certain academic classes and clinical labs for teaching-learning purposes. Students must sign a release form for videotaping at the time of registration. Students should obtain permission from instructors to videotape or audiotape lectures. Verbal permission is acceptable. training Laboratory 1. Foreword: Most of the core sonography courses in the 3500, 3600, 3810, and 3820 been developed to include a large and crucial hands-on training component in the program's ultrasound training laboratory. This model offers a considerable benefit to the learning process of technical skills before students start clinical externships during the second year of study. The program strives to expose the students to state-of-the-art equipment for the acquisition of these skills. The program also ensures that the environment in the ultrasound training laboratory is safe. 2. Technical Standards: The profession of diagnostic medical sonographer includes, but is not limited to, the following physical, mental, auditory, and visual demands a. physical\u2014the ability to lift 50 pounds of weight, the ability to reach up, the ability to stand for up to 80 percent of the time, the ability to push or pull equipment and other devices such as College of Health Care Sciences\u2014B.H.Sc.\u2014Vascular Sonography/M.H.Sc.\u2014Vascular Sonography 197 wheelchairs or stretchers, and the manual dexterity to control the settings on computers and on the ultrasound equipment b. mental\u2014the ability to remember, recall, and analyze information; the ability to work in a noisy environment; the ability to remain focused despite interruptions; and the ability to cope with potentially stressful situations c. auditory\u2014the ability to hear from both ears within normal auditory range and the ability to distin - guish sounds within normal hearing range d. visual\u2014the ability to distinguish colors, the ability to monitor the environment, and the ability to work in dimmed light 3. Rules in the Use of the Training Laboratory: As previously outlined, the ultrasound training laboratory and its extensive use during the first year of study within the Bachelor or Master of Health Science with a specialization in Vascular Sonography is an essential component of the program. a. Conduct in the ultrasound training laboratory should follow the rules and policies outlined for the university and the College of Health Care Sciences, in an effort to create an environment adequate to foster optimal learning. b. Food and drink will not be allowed in the ultrasound training laboratory (a capped bottle of beverage can be kept with the student's personal belongings and used during the breaks outside the laboratory). c. The use of the ultrasound training laboratory will be strictly reserved to training sessions outlined by one of the professors and will be supervised by one of the professors. d. A copy of the specific rules and regulations pertaining to teaching in the ultrasound training lab will be provided at the first lab session in the first term on campus in the program (in Introduction to Ultrasound, or BSV 3220). The rules will be explained by the professor assigned to the class. e. Safeguards\u2014Instruction sessions in the ultrasound training laboratory are made possible by the participation of students, both as the person scanning and the person being scanned (subject). All the exercises are developed to ensure prudent and safe use of the equipment, as well as the subject. Participation is voluntary. Election not to participate will not affect grades, however, alternate training will need to be arranged.

Policies that are not covered in this section are addressed in previous sections of the handbook. The following policies are specific to Master of Health Science program students. Attendance All M.H.Sc. courses are designed in distance learning formats. Each student holds the responsibility to fulfill all class requirements, access recommended resources, and meet the appropriate deadlines for assignment submission and exams. There are no on-campus requirements, except for students in the Health Law Track, who will have to attend an on-campus seminar twice over the course of their M.H.Sc. studies. The program reserves the right to administratively withdraw students who have registered for a course but have not logged into that course or contacted the program by the end of the first two weeks of the semester. All students are also required to log in to the student center at least once a week. Administrative Withdrawals Unless prior approval or a leave of absence has been granted, students who do not enroll in any classes for two consecutive semesters may be administratively withdrawn (WU) from the M.H.Sc. program. If a student is administratively withdrawn from the program, he or she would be required to petition the program director in writing for reinstatement in the program. Grading Policies and Procedures Grading for courses in the Master of Health Science program is based on an alpha scale. Students who receive a failing grade in a course will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress for disposition. Alpha GradeA A- B+B B- 0-74 Requirements for Graduation Students are required to submit applications for degrees once they have enrolled in their final semester. Exceptions to this policy can be granted on a case-by-case basis by the program director for students who wish to continue their studies to complete additional coursework or an additional specialty track. Students who plan to continue their studies to complete additional coursework or an additional specialty track, must submit their requests in writing and have documented plans to complete the educational program to which they were admitted within five (5) years from date of admission into the program. (Final semester is defined as the semester in which the student obtains the 37 required hours for the generalist, sports medicine, leadership in health care, or higher education tracks; 39 required hours for the forensic investigative technology track; or 41 hours for the health law track.). Information regarding the degree application process can be found on the M.H.Sc. Student Center on Blackboard. College of Health Care Sciences\u2014B.H.Sc./M.H.Sc.\u2014General and Vascular Sonography 199 A cumulative GPA of a minimum of 3.0 is required for graduation from the MHS program. Students completing the course work for graduation but not achieving the required minimum GPA for gradu- ation will be required to enroll in additional course work at additional costs to bring their cumulative GPA up to the minimum requirement for graduation. If you are receiving financial aid , you need to contact the financial aid office at (954) 262-3380 or toll free at 800-806-3680 to obtain their advice on how your decision to continue beyond your degree requirements may or may not affect your financial aid eligibility. Graduation with Honors A student graduating with a cumulative GPA of 3.74 or higher is eligible to receive the degree with honors. A student graduating with a cumulative GPA of 4.0 is eligible to receive the degree with high honors. Retake Policy If a required course is failed, the student must repeat the course at its next regularly scheduled offering. Additional tuition will be charged for repeated courses. A student who has experienced two or more course failures while in the Master of Health Science Program may be dismissed from the program. Any course failed on first taking will be considered a course failure. Passing a course through retake does not negate the original failure for purposes of retention in the program. Credit t ransfer Students matriculated in the M.H.Sc. program may petition for transfer of credits to the program. Up to, but not to exceed, 6 credit hours of graduate work (of a grade B or higher) may be considered for transfer from a regionally accredited institution. The courses considered for transfer must meet the goals and objectives of the M.H.Sc. courses in question, and cannot have been previously applied toward another awarded degree in or outside of NSU. Continuous enrollment The program requires students to enroll in at least one course per semester for the duration of their M.H.Sc. studies. If a student needs to take a semester off during the academic year, a formal request for a leave of absence shall be submitted to the program director, and will be subject to approval. Continuing Services The program is designed to be completed in three years. Continuing services fees will be imposed after 36 months in the program. All students must finish the program within five years of the date of acceptance, or they will be dismissed. After the 36th month in the program, students will be enrolled in the continuing services at a cost of $990 per semester. Bachelor and master of Health Science\u2014General and Vascular Sonography This entry-level course of study is designed to prepare students in the field of general and vascular sonography and testing. Students spend the first year on NSU's main campus in Davie, Florida, and receive both didactic training in lecture halls and hands-on experience in our ultrasound training labo - ratory. During the second year, students will receive clinical training that focuses on vascular testing in a vascular laboratory or an ultrasound department under the supervision of a registered diagnostic medial sonographer (RDMS) and/or registered vascular technologist (RVT). In addition to the clinical training in the second year, students will be required to continue online courses.200 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014B.H.Sc./M.H.Sc.\u2014General and Vascular Sonography Academic Calendar 2014-2015 Both degree-level programs in general and vascular sonography programs follow the same term schedule, starting in the summer term of the respective academic year, and continuing through the end of the summer term two academic years later, for an overall program length of approximately 27 months. The specific start and end dates are based on the overall schedule mandated by the university. Please refer to online university resources for specific calendar and term dates and holiday observances. All purely online courses at both the bachelor's and master's levels are on a four-term calendar (each term is approximately 12 weeks long). Refer to the academic calendar published in this handbook and on Web-based resources by the online B.H.Sc. and M.H.Sc. programs respectively for specific term dates. The classroom and lab-based courses, including the clinical externships, are on a three-term calendar. Academic Promotions and Progression Honors: The students may receive academic honors per term based on the completed work for the term. The policy for dean's or chancellor's lists follows that in place for the College of Health Care Sciences. A notice will be sent to the student and notification will be entered on his or her transcript. Graduation with Honors: A student graduating with a cumulative GPA of 3.74 or higher is eligible to receive the degree with honors. A student graduating with a cumulative GPA of 4.0 is eligible to receive the degree with high honors. Academic Progress: For each course offered within the program, contact information for the designated contact person for that course will be available in the syllabus of the course. Students are strongly encouraged to consult with their professors or lab instructors regarding any issues impeding academic progress. Students are also strongly encouraged to contact the program director, if necessary. Academic Progress in Clinical Externships: Clinical externships are assessed on different criteria outlined in the syllabi for these courses. Failure to meet the requirements for any of these criteria may result in failure for the externship, with similar consequences as for failure of any didactic courses including, but not limited to, possible dismissal from the program. Academic Progression: The Bachelor and Master of Health Science degrees with a specialization in General and Vascular Sonography are lockstep programs. The sequence of the courses has been thoughtfully determined. Progression from one term to the next is, for sonography courses, based on the successful completion of the courses offered in prior terms. The progress of each student through the curriculum requires continuous satisfactory academic performance. In order to complete the general and vascular sonography program, students must successfully complete the core sonography courses in the time and sequence that they are offered. Students who receive a final course grade of F in any core vascular didactic course will not be allowed to progress to the next semester. Retake/Repeat/Remediation If a student fails a core sonography course, a cumulative remediation of written and/or practical examination will be administered. Grades on the transcript will be qualified to indicate a repeated course or a remediation examination. A final course grade of less than C in any given core sonography course will constitute a course failure (this includes a grade achieved through a remediation examination). The grade from a remediation examination can be no higher than a C. Students who fail a core sonography course and the remediation examination will be sent to the Committee on Student Progress with recom - mendation and may be dismissed from the program. College of Health Care Sciences\u2014B.H.Sc./M.H.Sc.\u2014General and Vascular Sonography 201 While matriculating through the B.H.Sc. or M.H.Sc. General and Vascular Sonography programs, each student is permitted to remediate a total of two core courses. A student will be allowed to sit for only one remediation examination per course. Students in the B.H.Sc.\u2014General and Vascular Sonography or M.H.Sc.\u2014General and Vascular Sonography program also take courses online. These courses do not offer remediation. A failure in one of the online courses means the course will need to be repeated at additional cost and may delay graduation from the program. A student with two or more course failures will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress and may be dismissed. A student who is dismissed on the basis of inadequate academic performance or unprofessional conduct will be required to reapply to the program in order to be considered for readmission under the admissions standards applicable to the next class. The application will be treated in the same manner as a first-time applicant. Any student who is readmitted to the program will be considered a first-time applicant for the purposes of coursework and must repeat all required coursework, including courses completed previously. Clinical Courses\u2014the following applies to the clinical externship courses (BHS 4500, 4600, and 4700): None of these courses can be remediated. If requirements are not met by the end of the course, the externship will be extended as appropriate, as determined by the program director. If a preceptor or supervisor requests that a student be removed from a clinical site, the student will be automatically suspended pending a hearing by the Committee on Student Progress, which may result in course failure and/or dismissal from the program (even without any prior failure on record). All other rules regarding academic honesty, cheating, attendance, and professionalism apply to the clinical externship courses. Grading Policies and Procedures Alpha GradeA for the Bachelor and Master of Health Science with a Specialization in General and Vascular Sonography are graded on an alpha scale (described above). Students must pass all courses with a grade of C or better. Any grade lower than a C will result in failure of the course. Students receiving a failing grade will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress (CSP). Any failed online course may need to be repeated and additional tuition will be charged. Failure of any single core course will be cause for referral to the CSP and may be cause for dismissal from the program. Each student must pass all courses with a C or better in all required courses for the B.H.Sc.\u2014General and Vascular Sonography or the M.H.Sc.\u2014General and Vascular Sonography degree. Graduation with Honors\u2014B.H.Sc. A student eligible for graduation with a cumulative grade point average of 3.8 or higher who has completed at least 90 credits at NSU is eligible to receive the degree with distinction.202 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014B.H.Sc./M.H.Sc.\u2014General and Vascular Sonography Graduation with Honors\u2014m.H.Sc. A student eligible for graduation with a cumulative grade point average of 3.74 or higher is eligible to receive the degree with honors. A student eligible for graduation with a cumulative grade point average of 4.0 is eligible to receive the degree with high honors. Incomplete Coursework For the M.H.Sc. program, a grade of incomplete (I ) is issued because of unexpected emergencies and must be made up within one month, based on instructor recommendation and program director approval. For the B.H.Sc. program, the student will have one semester to complete a course after the conditions of the incomplete have been agreed to, based on instructor recommendation and program director approval. Students requesting extensions due to medical or military reasons are expected to provide official documentation. It is the student's responsibility to consult the instructor and submit the Incomplete Grade Agreement Form (download available from the B.H.Sc. and M.H.Sc. Student Center) prior to the end of the course. The form must be signed by the student, instructor, and the B.H.Sc. or M.H.Sc. program director. The student must have successfully completed 50 percent of the assignments prior to course end and prior to requesting an incomplete grade. The instructor will not accept assignments received after the date indicated on the agreement, and the student's grade will be assigned according to the work the student completed by the end of the course. A grade of I cannot be given if less than 50 percent of the assignments have been completed by the official end date of the course. An incomplete grade that has not been changed by the official date in this agreement will be converted to an F by the administrative staff members of the Department of Health Science.

Cardiac Sonography Certificate Program This 12-month lock-step program is designed to prepare practicing sonographers for the cardiac registry exam. The courses will be delivered in a hybrid format, with online courses and on-campus lab sessions in the evenings or on weekends at the NSU main campus. A clinical externship is offered during the last two terms of the program. Graduates will be eligible to take the national examinations for the cardiac registry as administered by the American Registry of Diagnostic medical Sonographers (ARDMS) and/ or the Cardiovascular Credentialing International (CCI). College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Cardiac Sonography Certificate 205 Academic Calendar 2014-2015 The program will start in the summer of the respective academic year and follow the three-term calendar (summer, fall, and winter) for an overall length of 12 months. The specific start and end dates are based on the overall schedule mandated by the university. Please refer to online university resources for specific calendar and term dates and holiday observances. Academic Promotions and Progression Academic progress: For each course offered within the program, contact information for that course will be available in the syllabus of the course. Students are strongly encouraged to consult with their professors and/or lab instructors regarding any issues affecting academic progress. Students are also strongly encouraged to contact the program director, if necessary. Academic progress in clinical externships: Clinical externships are assessed on criteria outlined in the syllabi for these courses. Failure to meet the requirements for any of these criteria may result in failure for the externship term, with similar consequences as for failure of any didactic course including, but not limited to, possible dismissal from the program. Academic progression: The Cardiac Sonography Certificate is a lock-step program. The sequence of the courses has been thoughtfully determined. Progression from one term to the next is based on the successful completion of the courses offered in prior terms. The progress of each student through the curriculum requires continuous satisfactory academic performance. In order to complete the cardiac sonography certificate program, students must successfully complete the core sonography courses in the time and sequence that they are offered. Students who receive a final course grade of F in any core sonography didactic course will not be allowed to progress to the next semester. Retake/Repeat/Remediation If a student fails a core sonography course, a cumulative remediation of written and/or practical examination will be administered at the end of the term. Grades on the transcript will be quali- fied to indicate a repeated course or remediated course. A final course grade of less than C in any given core cardiovascular course will constitute a course failure (this includes a grade achieved through a remediation examination). The grade from any remediation examination can be no lower than a C. Students who fail a core sonography course and the remediation examination will be sent to the Committee on Student Progress and may be dismissed. While matriculating through the cardiac sonography program, each student is permitted to remediate a total of two core courses. A student will be allowed to sit for only one remediation examination per course. A student who is dismissed on the basis of inadequate academic performance who wish to reenroll in the program will be required to reapply to the program in order to be considered for admission. The application will be treated in the same manner as a first-time applicant, under the admissions standards applicable to the next entering class. Any student who is readmitted to the program will be considered a first-time applicant for the purposes of coursework and must repeat all required coursework, including any courses completed previously. If a preceptor or supervisor requests that a student be removed from a clinical site, the student will be automatically suspended pending a hearing by the Committee on Student Progress, which may result in course failure and/or dismissal from the program (even without any prior failure on record). All other rules regarding academic honesty, cheating, attendance, and professionalism apply to the clinical externship courses.206 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Cardiac Sonography Certificate Grading Policies and Procedures Courses for the Cardiac Sonography Certificate program are graded on an alpha scale. Each student must pass all courses with a C or better. Any grade lower than a C will result in failure of the course. Students receiving a failing grade will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress (CSP). Any failed course may need to be repeated and additional tuition will be charged. Alpha Grade A A- B+B B- C+CFScale4.0 sonography course is a lock-step program. A grade of incomplete (I ) is issued because of unexpected emergencies and must be made up within one month, based on instructor recommendation and program director approval. Students requesting extensions due to medical or military reasons are expected to provide official documentation. It is the student's responsibility to consult the instructor and submit the Incomplete Grade Agreement Form prior to the end of the course. The form must be signed by the student, instructor, and the program director. The student must have successfully completed 50 percent of the assignments prior to course end and prior to requesting an incomplete grade. The instructor will not accept assignments received after the date indicated on the agreement, and the student's grade will be assigned according to the work the student completed by the end of the course. A grade of I cannot be given if less than 50 percent of the assignments have been completed by the official end date of the course. An incomplete grade that has not been changed by the official date in this agreement will be converted to an F by the administrative staff members of the Department of Health Science. Clinical externships Clinical Externship placement: Students who enroll into the program have the opportunity to perform their clinical externship in their own place of work or with another facility that has approved their externship. In either case, the program will verify the criteria of appropriateness and request a clinical affiliation agreement in accordance with the terms of Nova Southeastern University. Details will be provided during initial orientation into the program. For those students who are not considered in the above paragraph, the program will assign the clinical site. Students should be aware that a special fee applies in this case. Clinical externships will be performed during the second and third terms in the program. As this program is oriented to working sonographers, time flexibility during the weeks will be considered in coordination with the clinical mentors and students. Duties and expectations in clinical externships: Students in clinical externships must follow all the rules and regulations of the university and the clinical site, including but not restricted to, rules and regulations on confidentiality. Written work submitted as part of class assignments must not include any identifying information on the patient. To facilitate communication between the student and the program during the clinical externships, the student must provide a cellular phone number to the clinical coordinator. The expense of the cellular phone and its function will be the student's responsibility. Absences or tardiness from the clinical externship site should College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Cardiac Sonography Certificate 207 be communicated to the clinical coordinator AND the clinical instructor in the clinical site, preferably before the start of the shift assigned, but no later than 24 hours. Time keeping: Time keeping during clinical externships is done through Chrono-Tek\u2014an auto- mated telephone system subcontracted by the program. The student will be given a building code and an ID number, as well as instructions on the use of the system prior to his or her first day in the clinical externship site. Any student found to be tampering with or manipulating the documenta\u00action process may receive disciplinary action and/or fail the clinical rotation. Clinical extension of program: If, for any reason, the student does not fulfill the requirements for clinical externships, the program has the authority to extend the student's clinical externships, which may result in additional cost to the student. Clinical Site Requirements Students in off-site clinical sites will be required to comply with all the special requirements of the facility. These requirements may include, but are not limited to, fingerprinting, proof of vacci- nations, and proof of insurance. The college does not assume any responsibility for the student's compliance with these requirements, other than informing the student of the requirements. The student must fully comply with all requirements of the specific facility before participating in any activities at that facility. Failure to be eligible to participate in activities at an assigned facility may result in the student not being allowed to complete that clinical experience; in that case, the student will be reassigned to another clinical rotation, if possible. Students may be videotaped in certain academic classes and clinical labs for teaching-learning purposes. Students must sign a release form for videotaping at the time of registration. Students should obtain permission from instructors to videotape or audiotape lectures. Verbal permission is acceptable. training Laboratory 1. Foreword: Most of the core sonography courses in the program have been developed to include a crucial hands-on training component in the program's ultrasound training laboratory. This model offers a considerable benefit to the learning process and acquisition of technical skills by the student before the start of clinical externships during the second year of study. The program strives to equip the student with fundamental skills and exam techniques through the use of state-of-the-art equip- ment for the acquisition of examination information. The program also ensures that the training environment in the ultrasound training laboratory is safe and that all students obtain the training benefits in an equitable manner. 2. Students will have the opportunity to select their lab sessions during one week night or Saturday morning as pre-determined by the faculty. 3. Technical Standards: The profession of diagnostic medical sonography includes, but is not limited to, the following physical, mental, auditory, and visual demands: a. physical\u2014the ability to lift 50 pounds of weight, the ability to reach up, the ability to stand for up to 80 percent of the time, the ability to push or pull equipment and other devices, such as wheelchairs or stretchers, and the manual dexterity to control the settings on computers and on the ultrasound equipment. b. mental\u2014the ability to remember, recall, and analyze information; the ability to work in a noisy environment; the ability to remain focused despite interruptions; and the ability to cope with potentially stressful situations. c. auditory\u2014the ability to hear from both ears within normal auditory range and the ability to distinguish sounds within normal hearing range. d. visual\u2014the ability to distinguish colors, the ability to monitor the environment, and the ability to work in dimmed light.208 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Master of Health Science 4. Rules in the Use of the Training Laboratory: As previously outlined, the ultrasound training labora - tory and its extensive use during the didactic portion of study within the program is an essential and critical component of the program. a. Conduct in the ultrasound training laboratory will follow the rules and policies outlined for the university and the college in an effort to create an environment adequate to foster optimal learning. b. Food and drink will not be allowed in the ultrasound training laboratory (a capped bottle of beverage can be kept with the student's personal belongings and used during the breaks outside the laboratory). c. The use of the ultrasound training laboratory will be strictly reserved to training sessions outlined by one of the professors and will be supervised by one of the professors. Students are not allowed in the lab unless supervised by a professor or instructor. d. A copy of the specific rules and regulations pertaining to teaching in the ultrasound training lab will be provided at the first lab session in the first term on campus in the program. The rules will be explained by the professor assigned to the class. All students will sign a copy. e. Safeguards\u2014Instruction sessions in the ultrasound training laboratory are made possible by the participation of students, both as the person scanning and the person being scanned (subject). All the exercises are developed to ensure prudent and safe use of the equipment, as well as the safety of the subject.

Concurrent master of Health Science option Students who already hold a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution with a minimum GPA of 3.0 are eligible to apply for the concurrent Master of Health Science (M.H.Sc.) option. Students who enroll in this concurrent M.H.Sc. program will graduate with a Bachelor of Science\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography and a Master of Health Science. Both programs will be completed in 27 months. If interested in the concurrent Master of Health Science option, please contact an admissions counselor or the program office for further details. master of Health Science Program Because the Master of Health Science Program is delivered in a distance format, not all of the policies contained in this handbook are applicable to M.H.Sc. students. Policies that are not covered in this section are addressed in previous sections of the handbook. The following policies are specific to Master of Health Science program students. Attendance All M.H.Sc. courses are designed in distance learning formats. Each student holds the responsibility to fulfill all class requirements, access recommended resources, and meet the appropriate deadlines for College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Master of Health Science 209 assignment submission and exams. There are no on-campus requirements, except for students in the Health Law Track, who will have to attend an on-campus seminar once over the course of their M.H.Sc. studies. The program reserves the right to administratively withdraw students who have registered for a course but have not logged into that course or contacted the program by the end of the first two weeks of the semester. All students are also required to log in to the student center at least once a week. Grading Policies and Procedures Grading for courses in the Master of Health Science program is based on an alpha scale. Alpha Grade A A-B+ B B- C+ 75-760-74 Requirements for Graduation Students are required to submit applications for degrees once they have enrolled in their final semester. Exceptions to this policy can be granted on a case-by-case basis by the program director for students who wish to continue their studies to complete additional coursework or an additional specialty track. Students who plan to continue their studies to complete additional coursework or an additional specialty track, must submit their requests in writing and have documented plans to complete the educational program to which they were admitted within five years from date of admission into the program. (Final semester is defined as the semester in which the student obtains the 37 required hours for the generalist, sports medicine, leadership in health care, or higher education tracks; 39 required hours for the forensic investigative technology track; or 41 hours for the health law track.) Information regarding the degree application process can be found on the M.H.Sc. Student Center on Blackboard.

Graduation with Honors A student graduating with a cumulative GPA of 3.74 or higher is eligible to receive the degree with honors. A student graduating with a cumulative GPA of 4.0 is eligible to receive the degree with high honors. Retake Policy If a required course is failed, the student must repeat the course at its next regularly scheduled offering. Additional tuition will be charged for repeated courses. A student who has experienced two or more course failures while in the Master of Health Science Program may be dismissed from the program. Any course failed on first taking will be considered a course failure. Passing a course through retake does not negate the original failure for purposes of retention in the program. Credit t ransfer Students matriculated in the M.H.Sc. program may petition for transfer of credits to the program. Up to, but not to exceed, 6 credit hours of graduate work (of a grade B or higher) may be considered for transfer from a regionally accredited institution. The courses considered for transfer must meet the goals 210 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Master of Science in Anesthesia and objectives of the M.H.Sc. courses in question, and cannot have been previously applied toward another awarded degree in or outside of NSU. Continuous enrollment The program requires students to enroll in at least one course per semester for the duration of their M.H.Sc. studies. If a student needs to take a semester off during the academic year, a formal request for a leave of absence shall be submitted to the program director, and will be subject to approval. Continuing Services The program is designed to be completed in three years. Continuing services fees will be imposed after 36 months in the program. All students must finish the program within five years of the date of acceptance, or they will be dismissed. After the 36th month in the program, students will be enrolled in the continuing services at a cost of $990 per semester. master of Science in Anesthesia fort Lauderdale and tampa Accreditation, national examinations, and Licensure The Master of Science in Anesthesia course of study is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP). Graduates will be eligible to take the national certi - fication examination administered by the National Commission for Certification of Anesthesiologist Assistants (NCCAA) in conjunction with the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME). Grading Policies and Procedures Grading for academic and clinical-year AA students is based on the following alpha scale: Alpha Grade A A-B+B B- C+ grading, the anesthesiologist assistant course of study may use transcript notations outlined in the College of Health Care Sciences section of this handbook. A minimum grade of a C is required in all anesthesia specialization courses and all M.H.Sc. and College of Medical Sciences courses. Academic Promotions and Progression The Master of Science in Anesthesia is a lock-step program. The sequence of the courses have been thoughtfully determined. Progression from one term to the next is, for Master of Science in Anesthesia core courses, based on the successful completion of the courses offered in prior terms. The progress of each student through the curriculum requires satisfactory continuous academic performance. In order to complete the Master of Science in Anesthesia program in the normally scheduled 27 months, students must successfully complete the courses in the time and sequence that they are offered. College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Master of Science in Anesthesia 211 Students who receive a final course grade of F in any Master of Science in Anesthesia core course will not be allowed to progress to the next semester until the course is passed by remediation (core didactic courses only) or course repeat (core clinical courses only). Students who fail to pass course remediation or course repeat at the next scheduled offering will receive an F in that course and may be dismissed from the program. Below are the core didactic courses of the Master of Science in Anesthesia program. All courses with the ANES/ANET prefix and the followingANA 5420 Anatomy PHS 5400 Physiology MHS 5103 Principals of Life Support Below are the core clinical courses of the Master of Science in Anesthesia program.ANET Anesthesia V , VI, VII No student may advance to the clinical year of study without satisfactorily completing all of the requirements for the didactic years' core courses. In addition, no student may complete the clinical-year curriculum and graduate without satisfactorily completing all of the requirements for the clinical-year coursework. Any student failing to exhibit satisfactory professional behavior will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress. Retake/Repeat/Remediation The Master of Science in Anesthesia program is in compliance with the Committee on Student Progress, and Course Remediation policies listed in the student handbook. The following policies apply to the program. Students who do not pass a core didactic course through initial offering or through remediation, will receive a final course grade of F and will be sent to the Committee on Student Progress and may be dismissed. Students in the Master of Science in Anesthesia program also take courses online. These courses do not offer remediation. A failure in one of the online courses means the course will need to be repeated at additional cost and may delay graduation from the program. Additional tuition will be charged for any repeated course. Clinical Courses\u2014the following applies to the clinical core courses (ANES/ANET 5001, 5002, 6001, 6002, 6003): None of these courses can be remediated. If requirements are not met by the end of the course, the student will be sent to the Committee on Student Progress and the student's program will be extended as appropriate, until all course requirements are met. If all requirements are not met following the program extension period, the student will be sent to the Committee on Student Progress and will repeat the course. Grades on the transcript will be qualified to indicate a repeated course. If a preceptor or supervisor requests that a student be removed from a clinical site, the student will be automatically suspended pending a hearing by the Committee on Student Progress, which may result in course repeat, course failure, and/or immediate dismissal from the program (even without any prior failure on record). Academic Warning/Probation/Dismissal The program complies with the College of Health Care Sciences policies related to academic warning, academic probation, and dismissal. Additional policies may apply at the discretion of the program director.212 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Dual-Degree M.H.Sc./D.H.Sc. Clinical Rotations The first year of study focuses on the foundations of anesthesia practice through classroom, mock operating room scenarios and studies, and laboratory work. Clinical experience during the first year will increase as the year progresses. The senior year (semesters five, six, and seven) will consist of clinical rotations assigned in intervals ranging from two weeks to two months. During the senior year, clinical rotations are full time and involve all specialty areas in anesthesia, including general surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, otolaryngology, orthopedics, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, genito-urinary surgery, vascular surgery, cardiac surgery, thoracic surgery, transplantation, and trauma. Clinical rotations include days, evenings, nights, weekends, and on-call\u2014depending upon the rotation. All AA students on clinical rotations must maintain a functional pager or cell phone at all times during their clinical rotations. This expense will be the student's responsibility. To facilitate communications, AA students must provide the AA program with their pager or cell phone numbers and inform the program in advance of any changes. Students must comply with all policies and procedures of both the clinical sites and Nova Southeastern University. Additional Specific Policies Students will receive the program's clinical handbook that will cover respectively all policies, proce - dures, courses, and rotations appropriate for the curriculum. These handbooks provide more specifics for guidance and governance of the students while in the program. The College of Health Care Sciences Student Handbook supersedes the program handbooks if there are direct conflicts, although the program's handbooks may be more strict and/or detailed. Student Code of Conduct, Academic Dishonesty, and Student Disciplinary Procedures Policy The Health Science Department adheres to the Nova Southeastern University Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility, Academic Honesty Policy and Procedure, Student Appeals Policy and Procedure, and student disciplinary procedures sections located in the college and university sections of this handbook. Accelerated Dual-Degree m.H.Sc./D.H.Sc. Program Students in the Accelerated Dual-Degree M.H.Sc./D.H.Sc. program fall under the policies of the M.H.Sc. and D.H.Sc. programs. To be eligible to receive the M.H.Sc. and D.H.Sc. degrees, students must be of good moral character satisfactorily complete the 21 credits in the M.H.Sc. program and the 61 credits in the D.H.Sc. program receive a recommendation by the M.H.Sc. and D.H.Sc. program directors to the dean of the College of Health Care Sciences.

Grading Policies and Procedures Grading for the Doctor of Health Science Program is based on pass/fail. P Pass (80 percent or above) F Fail (Below 80 percent) I Incomplete Retake Policy, Student Progress, Academic Probation, and Dismissal If a required course is failed, the student must repeat the course at its next regularly scheduled offering. Additional tuition will be charged for repeated courses. A student who has experienced one course failure may be placed on academic probation. A student with two or more course failures while in the Doctor of Health Science Program may be dismissed from the program. Any course failed on first taking will be considered a course failure. Passing a course through retake does not negate the original failure for purposes of retention in the program. The procedures and deliberative bodies that implement this policy are those described in the college section of this handbook that discusses student progress. Credit t ransfer Students matriculated in the D.H.Sc. program may petition for transfer of up to 8 credits to meet Core Block One, Core Block T wo, or elective course requirements. Courses considered for transfer must be from a regionally accredited university and identified clearly as doctoral-level courses by the sponsoring university. Courses taken at the master's degree-level are not transferable. If a transferred course will replace a required course, the transferred course must fully meet the goals and objectives of the NSU D.H.Sc. course in question. online Student Center All students are required to visit the online student center at least once every two weeks. All commu - nication and programmatic information will be posted in the online student center. Doctor of Philosophy in Health Science (Ph.D.) Program Because the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Health Science Program is delivered in distance format, not all of the policies contained in this handbook are applicable to Ph.D. students. Policies that are not covered in this section are addressed in previous sections of the handbook. The following policies are specific to students in the Doctor of Philosophy Program.214 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Doctor of Philosophy in Health Science Credit t ransfer Students matriculated in the Ph.D. program may petition for transfer of up to, but not to exceed, 8 credit hours to meet D.H.Sc. Core Block One or Core Block T wo course requirements from a regionally accredited doctoral program of study, but only if the transferred courses meet the goals and objectives of the course in question. Attendance The Ph.D. courses are designed in distance-learning formats. Each student holds the responsibility to fulfill all class requirements, access recommended resources, and meet the designated deadlines for assignment submission and exams. Students will attend a minimum of three on-campus seminars over the course of their Ph.D. studies and will present an oral dissertation defense in person. The oral defense can be done at the summer or winter institute, or on the main campus. This must be arranged with the Ph.D. program office at least 45 days in advance. All students are required to log in to the doctoral programs in the health science student center at least once every two weeks. Continuous enrollment The Doctor of Philosophy in Health Science (Ph.D.) Program requires students to enroll in at least one course per semester for the duration of the Ph.D. studies. If a student needs to take a semester off during the academic year, a formal request for a leave of absence must be submitted to the program director, and will be subject to approval. Continuing Services The Ph.D. program is designed to take no longer than seven years. All students must finish the program within seven years of their initial date of acceptance into the Ph.D. in Health Science Program, or they will be dismissed. Academic Withdrawals Unless prior approval or a leave of absence has been granted, students who do not enroll in any classes for two consecutive semesters may be administratively withdrawn (WU) from the Doctor of Philosophy in Health Science (Ph.D.) Program. If a student is administratively withdrawn from the program, he or she would need to reapply for entrance into the Ph.D. program. Grading Policies and Procedures Students must successfully complete and pass all Doctor of Health Science (DHS) core courses in order to register for core courses in the Doctor of Philosophy in Health Science (Ph.D.) Program. Grading for the Doctor of Philosophy in Health Science program is based on pass/fail. P Pass (80 percent or above) F Fail (below 80 percent) I Incomplete PR ProgressNPR No Progress Dismissal A student who has experienced one course failure in the Ph.D. program will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress for disposition, which may result in dismissal from the program. See the Committee on Student Progress procedures in the college section of this handbook. Students who are dismissed from the program may appeal the decision of dismissal to the College-Wide Appeals Committee of College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Doctor of Philosophy in Health Science 215 the College of Health Care Sciences. (See procedures on student appeals in the college section of this handbook under Student Appeals.) Incomplete Coursework A grade of incomplete (I) is issued because of unexpected emergencies and must be made up within one semester following the final class date of the course, as stipulated by the course instructor and with approval of the program director. If the incomplete grade (I) is not made up accordingly, it will be converted into a failing grade (F). Courses that are offered only once per calendar year must be completed by the end of the following calendar year. Students must request any extension, in writing, from the course instructor, with a copy to the program director. Comprehensive examination The comprehensive examination is a written examination that students take after the completion of all the required Ph.D. in Health Science course work, and before beginning the dissertation phase of the Ph.D. program. It is designed to evaluate a student's ability to demonstrate that he/she is a suitable candidate for a Ph.D. degree. Successful completion of the comprehensive examination is required for students to move to advanced standing and begin dissertation research. The comprehensive examina- tion is given two times per academic year during the summer and winter semesters, and takes place on the Nova Southeastern University main campus in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Students must take the comprehensive examination within one year of completion of all academic coursework. Failure to complete the requirements within the time frame may result in dismissal from the program. Students register with the Department of Health Science prior to the comprehensive exam and receive an examination number. Students who register for the comprehensive examination certify by this action that they are prepared to take the exam. However, participating in the comprehensive examination preparatory training does not mean that students will pass the comprehensive examination. Students can withdraw from the comprehensive examination without a reason 10 days before the exam. Once this time has passed students with circumstances beyond their control such as, sickness, car accident, family illness or other extenuating circumstances, must notify the Ph.D. program director at the earliest possible time and provide documentation to support their need to withdraw from the exam. Students who have obtained approval from the Ph.D. Program Director to withdraw from the comprehensive examination, will be allowed to take the comprehensive examination at the next scheduled offering. Students who registered for the comprehensive examination and do not show, or students who do not contact the program director requesting to be excused from the examination will automatically fail the comprehensive examination. Students who have failed the comprehensive exam are referred to the Department of Health Science Committee for Student Progress (CSP) for possible dismissal from the Ph.D. program. The CSP then makes recommendations to the department chair. The department chair notifies the student of the decision by certified mail (return receipt requested) and by email with response requested. Students have the right to appeal the decision of dismissal from the Ph.D. program to the College of Health Care Sciences Appeals Committee within five business days of notification from the chair of their department. The grading of the Comprehensive Examination is on a Pass/Fail basis. Students must pass all three categories on the comprehensive examination to move forward to the dissertation phase of the Ph.D. program. Students are notified of their results on the comprehensive examination by certified mail and a copy of the letter is sent to students' NSU email accounts. Following the successful completion of the comprehensive examination, students can register for dissertation credits and begin the disserta - tion process. Students who pass two of the three categories may retake the one failed category at the next scheduled examination date. Students have one opportunity to pass the failed category. Students who wish to 216 College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Doctor of Philosophy in Health Science dispute their grades must contact the Ph.D. program director, as there is no direct communication between graders and students. The program director will interact directly with the faculty who graded the exams and inform the student of the grader's comments. The grade dispute ends at the program director level. Failure to pass the comprehensive examination may result in dismissal from the program, irrespective of students' performance in other aspects of doctoral study. Students who do not pass two, or all three categories, have failed the comprehensive exam and are referred to the Department of Health Science Committee for Student Progress. All college-wide policies regarding academic honesty, student progress committee, and appeals apply to the compre - hensive exam. Students are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with the academic standards and the academic honesty policy and procedure as described in the College of Health Care Science Student Handbook. Dissertation The dissertation is scheduled as six courses over two years. The dissertation will culminate with an oral final defense, which will occur in person at the Summer or Winter Institute, or on the main campus. The oral defense must be arranged with the Ph.D. program office at least 45 days in advance. Process and requirements are detailed in the Health Professions Division Dissertation Guide. For any additional semester after the initial six courses, students will register for a dissertation continua - tion course with a continuing service charge to maintain the students' full time enrollment. At the end of each semester, students who demonstrate forward progress on their dissertation will earn a PR (in progress) grade. Students who do not demonstrate forward progress will earn an NPR (not in progress) grade. Students who earn an NPR grade in any dissertation course may register for the next semester, although they may not be eligible for Federal funds. Students' progress through dissertation continua- tion may increase their total number of degree credits beyond the required 75. on-Campus Institutes These one-week sessions are located either on the Health Professions Division main campus in Fort Lauderdale, Florida; the regional campus in Orlando, Florida; or the regional campus in Tampa, Florida. Three such institutes are required to complete the Ph.D. degree. DHS 8010, 8080 and DHS 8170 will be offered as Summer Institutes. HSP 9007 will be offered as the Winter Institute. online Student Center All students are required to visit the online student center at least once every two weeks.
