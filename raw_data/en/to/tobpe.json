Sincerely, Thomas Flaig, MD Vice Chancellor for Research University of Colorado Denver | Anschutz Medical Campus Please join this campuswide discussion of the broad and diverse research community on the CU Anschutz Medical Campus - and our plans for future support and growth. |News||Events| In the Fall, we can see an increase in the number of limited institutional grant opportunities in which we can nominate a single applicant from our institution. Due to the short turn-around time we will have a modified and shortened process for these types of grant opportunities. For the limited institutional grant opportunities below, please submit a brief summary (one page or less) and biosketch by the date indicated. [American Honda Foundation](https://www.honda.com/community/applying-for-a-grant.) supports youth education with a specific focus on the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in addition to the environment. Institutions are limited to one funding request in a 12-month period. Interested candidates must send a one-page summary of their research proposal and their biosketch in pdf format to [Garrett Steed](mailto:GARRETT.STEED@CUANSCHUTZ.EDU) by December 11, 2020. [The Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation](https://www.dreyfus.org/camille-dreyfus-teacher-scholar/#nominationprocedure) has announced this year's Camille Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Awards Program. Institutions are allowed one nomination for this program. The Award supports the research and teaching careers of talented early career faculty and is open to academic institutions in the States, Districts, and Territories of the United States of America that grant a bachelor's or higher degree in the chemical sciences, including biochemistry, materials chemistry, and chemical engineering. Nominees must hold a full-time tenure-track academic appointment, and are normally expected to have been appointed no earlier than mid-year 2015. Awardees are from Ph.D. granting departments in which scholarly research is a principal activity. Undergraduate education is an important component. The award provides a $100,000 grant that is normally expended over five years. Interested candidates must send a one-page summary of their research proposal and their biosketch in pdf format to [Garrett Steed](mailto:GARRETT.STEED@CUANSCHUTZ.EDU) by December 11, 2020. *Institutions are limited to one application. The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity is to investigate the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of promoting infant immunization during prenatal care visits, leading parents to vaccinate their children confidently. Prenatal care providers, including obstetricians and midwives, are trusted sources of information for pregnant women, yet many feel uncomfortable providing information or discussing concerns about infant vaccination, likely because they consider this to be outside their area of expertise. This represents a significant missed opportunity to provide important information to pregnant women from a trusted source, at a critical time, when research suggests maternal opinions about childhood vaccination are forming. Interested candidates must send a one-page summary of their research proposal and their biosketch in pdf format to [Garrett Steed](mailto:GARRETT.STEED@CUANSCHUTZ.EDU) by December 11, 2020. *Institutions are limited to one application. Awardees will 1) Conduct and monitor epidemiologic and laboratory-based science, surveillance, and research related to COVID-19 and other global public health threats in Africa, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), including, but not limited to, assessments of the extent of pathogen exposures or transmission based on serologic testing, improved understanding of immune responses to infectious pathogens, and assessments of various approaches to collecting and analyzing the results of serologic testing; and, 2) Incorporate the results of these public health activities into operational disease detection, prevention, and response or control programs in regions noted above, strengthen public health capacity as outlined in the Global Health Security Agenda, and disseminate findings across the region, with partners, and globally. Interested candidates must send a one-page summary of their research proposal and their biosketch in pdf format to [Garrett Steed](mailto:GARRETT.STEED@CUANSCHUTZ.EDU) by December 11, 2020. *Institutions are limited to one application. The goal of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to support a network of US institutions to develop and implement standard research protocols to conduct prospective active surveillance for: a) acute gastroenteritis (AGE) due to norovirus, rotavirus and other enteric viruses; b) acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) due to respiratory viruses including, but not limited to, influenza, RSV, parainfluenza viruses, human flaccid (AFM) syndrome and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) among pediatric patients seeking healthcare at medical institutions. The network should also provide accurate estimates of the effectiveness in this population of influenza, rotavirus, COVID-19 and other vaccines against respiratory or enteric virus-associated illnesses projected to become available during the period of performance (e.g., RSV, norovirus). Interested candidates must send a one-page summary of their research proposal and their biosketch in pdf format to [Garrett Steed](mailto:GARRETT.STEED@CUANSCHUTZ.EDU) by December 18, 2020. This new initiative will establish highly collaborative, multi-disciplinary research teams to conduct translational and clinical research for the improved diagnosis, treatment and prevention of coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever). Interested candidates must send a one-page summary of their research proposal and their biosketch in pdf format to [Garrett Steed](mailto:GARRETT.STEED@CUANSCHUTZ.EDU) by December 18, 2020. *Institutions are limited to one application Since its establishment in 2006, the Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium (GpCRC), a multi-center coalition created and funded by NIDDK has made major advances to our understanding of the pathophysiology of Gastroparesis (Gp). Through the establishment of the largest gastroparesis tissue repository in the United States, combined with detailed phenotypic data, the GpCRC is ideally suited to accelerate insights into the underlying cellular and molecular pathophysiology of the gastroparesis with the ultimate goal of developing therapeutic target(s). This RFA invites investigators from several disciplines, including basic and translational research in areas of neurosciences, immunology, microbiology and physiology, to contribute new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of Gastroparesis. Examples of scientific topics that would be responsive to this announcement include, but are not limited to research on Gastroparesis that include: Collaboration with investigators in the GpCRC is not required but encouraged when the proposed study benefits from the clinical insight and or data/specimens available throughout the GpCRC. Interested candidates must send a one-page summary of their research proposal and their biosketch in pdf format to [Garrett Steed](mailto:GARRETT.STEED@CUANSCHUTZ.EDU) by December 18, 2020. This award is intended to identify the most talented Early Stage Investigators (ESIs) who intend to make a long-term commitment to research in the Environmental Health Sciences and assist them in launching an innovative research program focused on understanding the effects of environmental exposure on people's health. This opportunity limits individual schools and colleges within the University to one applicant each per competition. The ONES Program is specifically targeted to Early Stage Investigators and program goals include career promotion as well as the scientific project proposed. Applications for the ONES program differ from standard R01 applications in that applicants must describe plans for the active participation of an external advisory committee to provide consultation and feedback on the research and career guidance, commitment by the institution to actively support the research program development of the Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI), and a plan for career enhancement which will provide a strong foundation for future research endeavors. PD(s)/PI(s) must be NIH defined Early Stage Investigators and this eligibility must be included in the NIH Commons record prior to the review of the application. In addition, PD/PI's must have faculty appointments which are tenure track or equivalent, generally at the level of Assistant Professor, Research Assistant Professor, and have demonstrated outstanding abilities in basic, clinical, quantitative, or population-based research. Individuals must have established research independence from a mentor, and have dedicated, independent laboratory space or access to the clinical, population-based and/or public health research resources which will allow them to conduct the research proposed in the grant application as the lead, independent PD/PI.
