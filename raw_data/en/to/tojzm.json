FAQs What is the COVID-19 Antibody (Serology) Test Panel? Antibodies are proteins generated by our immune system in response to infectious agents. Antibodies can be produced even if a person has few or no symptoms during the infection. Anti-viral antibodies are also produced as part of the immune response to vaccination. The COVID-19 Antibody Test Panel can be used to assess recent or previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 as well as determine the presence of antibodies in individuals who have been vaccinated against the virus. This test is most accurate when sample is collected 3-4 weeks after exposure or onset of symptoms or post-vaccination. At this time, it is not known if the presence of antibodies to COVID-19 means you are immune to the virus and protected from re-infection. Importantly, it is not known how long antibody response to the COVID-19 virus and vaccination lasts. Based on current studies, antibodies to the COVID-19 virus can be detected up to 10 months post-exposure. The antibody test panel is not to be used for diagnosis of active COVID-19 infection. The COVID-19 Antibody Panel offered by LifeLabs contains the following two tests: - SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid total antibody: a qualitative test that helps assess natural exposure only. - SARS-CoV-2 Spike total antibody: a quantitative test that determines presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein generated post vaccination and/or natural exposure to the virus but cannot differentiate between the two. [What is the difference between COVID-19 diagnostic molecular (PCR) test, rapid antigen test, and Antibody Test Panel? ](javascript:void(0)) What is the difference between COVID-19 diagnostic molecular (PCR) test, rapid antigen test, and Antibody Test Panel? LifeLabs offers three types of COVID-19 tests. The molecular test (i.e., polymerase chain reaction or PCR) detects SARS-CoV-2 genetic material and is used to diagnose an active COVID-19 infection. A sample type used in molecular testing is a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab. The rapid antigen test detects SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein and may be used to diagnose an active COVID-19 infection. A sample type used in rapid antigen testing is a nasopharyngeal (NP) or nasal swab. The COVID-19 Antibody Test Panel is a blood test to detect antibodies to the virus. Results of the test show whether you had a recent or prior COVID-19 infection and/or if you have produced anti-viral antibodies as part of your immune response to vaccination. The Antibody Test Panel is not to be used for diagnosis of active COVID-19 infection. How can I get tested? The LifeLabs COVID-19 antibody test may be scheduled directly at any of our Patient Service Centres offering this service. You must have a requisition form completed by a physician or healthcare provider.

If more than 4 business days have passed since your sample was collected and you have not received your results in MyCareCompass, please email us at: - BC Residents: [support@bc.mycarecompass.lifelabs.com](mailto:support@bc.mycarecompass.lifelabs.com)or call 1-888-522-7758 - ON Residents: [support@on.mycarecompass.lifelabs.com](mailto:support@on.mycarecompass.lifelabs.com)or call 1-844-379-2398 For those that received a requisition directly from their health care provider, you also have the options to contact your health care provider to receive your test results. For minors, please refer to the FAQ [\"How & when do minors receive their test results?\"](#) How & when do minors receive their test results? The privacy of our patients is a priority. Currently, parents/guardians cannot register their children in MyCareCompass to view reports online. This applies to children under the age of 18 in Ontario and under the age of 16 in British Columbia. For those that purchased the pre-signed requisition for a minor through LifeLabs.com, they will be contacted by a member of the COVID clinical team directly by phone when their results are available. Test results are typically available within 4 business days from sample collection. There may be additional delays in receiving your phone call. For those that received a requisition directly from their child's healthcare provider, please contact that healthcare provider to receive your test results. Understanding your results The COVID-19 Antibody Test Panel has two tests. One detects antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein of the virus particle acquired through natural infection, while the other detects antibodies against the spike protein of the virus particle acquired through natural infection or vaccination. A negative COVID-19 antibody test result means that antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were not detected in your blood sample. This could mean that: | | SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid (N) Total Antibody | | SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) Total Antibody | | | | A positive antibody test result means that antibodies were detected in your blood sample. This typically indicates that: | | SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid (N) Total Antibody | | SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) Total Antibody | || | Interpretation of the results requires consideration of both tests together, and the most plausible interpretations are provided in the table below. | | SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Total Antibody | | SARS-CoV-2 Spike Total Antibody | | Plausible Interpretation* | | Negative | | Negative (<0.8U/ml) | | The results suggest undetectable levels of antibody generated in response to either natural infection or vaccination. | | Negative | | Positive (0.8U/ml) | | The results are consistent with an immune response due to vaccination. The correlation between antibody levels and immunity is not yet established. | | Positive | | Positive (0.8U/ml) | | The results suggest recent or prior infection with or without vaccination. The correlation between antibody levels and immunity is not yet established. | | Positive | | Negative (<0.8U/ml) | | Results suggest recent or prior infection. *Limitations of testing: - The COVID-19 antibody test panel is not to be used for diagnosis of an active COVID-19 infection. The molecular test/rapid antigen test may be used to diagnose active infection. - The result of the COVID-19 antibody test panel cannot tell you whether you are infectious (actively shedding virus). - False negative and false positive results are possible. Please consult with your physician to understand your lab test results. Please discuss both positive and negative results with your physician. Consulting with your physician to understand your result is not insured or covered by MSP. Your healthcare provider will determine the fee you will pay for this service. FAQs Overview The COVID-19 Antibody Test Panel is comprised of two blood tests that detect antibodies reactive to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins. These tests can be used to assess recent or previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 as well as the presence of total antibodies post-vaccination. Unlike a molecular or antigen COVID-19 test, the antibody test is not used in diagnosis of active infection. The Antibody Test Panel is most accurate (has highest clinical sensitivity) when a blood sample is collected 3-4 weeks after onset of symptoms/exposure or post-vaccination. At this time, it is not known if the presence of antibodies to COVID-19 means an individual is immune to the virus and protected from re-infection. Importantly, it is not known how long antibody response to the COVID-19 virus lasts. Based on current studies, antibodies to the COVID-19 virus can be detected up to 10 months post-exposure, but levels vary between individuals depending on disease severity, with levels higher in severe and lower in milder/asymptomatic cases. Antibody levels can also be lower in immunocompromised individuals. In addition, the level of antibody that offers adequate protection has not been established. LifeLabs COVID-19 Antibody Test Panel The Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 N Total Antibody is a semi-quantitative immunoassay which detects antibodies (IgG, IgM, and IgA) to the nucleocapsid (N) antigen of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S Total Antibody is a quantitative immunoassay which detects antibodies (IgG, IgM, and IgA) to the Spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Both assays detect high affinity antibodies, therefore favoring IgG, and do not differentiate between antibody type. The performance of both tests meet Health Canada requirements for COVID-19 antibody tests. The predictive value of the test is strongly dependent on prevalence of disease. Thus, clinical correlation is strongly recommended for test ordering and interpretation. The COVID-19 Antibody Test Panel now offered by LifeLabs can be used to detect anti-viral antibodies following vaccination and/or natural infection. The test detects antibodies against the nucleocapsid (N) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and antibodies to the spike (S) protein of the virus particle (1), elicited by vaccination and/or infection. Interpretation of COVID-19 Antibody test results The COVID-19 Antibody Test Panel has two tests. One detects antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein of the virus particle, while the other detects antibodies against the spike protein of the virus particle. A negative COVID-19 antibody test result means that antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were not detected in a patient's blood sample. This could mean that: | | SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Total Antibody | | SARS-CoV-2 Spike Total Antibody | | | | A positive antibody test result means that antibodies were detected in a patient's blood sample. This typically indicates that: | | SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Total Antibody | | SARS-CoV-2 Spike Total Antibody | || | Interpretation of the results requires consideration of both tests together, and the most plausible interpretations are provided in the table below. | | SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Total Antibody | | SARS-CoV-2 Spike Total Antibody | | Plausible Interpretation* | | Negative | | Negative (<0.8U/ml) | | The results suggest undetectable levels of antibody generated in response to either natural infection or vaccination. | | Negative | | Positive (0.8U/ml) | | The results are consistent with an immune response due to vaccination.
