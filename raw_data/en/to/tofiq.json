Production bottlenecks and supply chain logistics have frustrated vaccine availability for many high-risk individuals. Lost in the discussion is the impact of the COVID pandemic on our children's mental health. Children do not vote and may not receive adequate attention from politicians and policy-makers. There has been little discourse or resource allocation to address childhood social isolation and the associated anxiety and depression caused by the pandemic. School attendance is the best remedy to these issues. And the only way to get students back to school is to vaccinate teachers\u2014now. Although no one can argue with the strategy to prioritize first responders for vaccination, there is a compelling case to include teachers and school workers in the second group of eligible vaccinees. While the elderly has received justifiable attention because of increased COVID mortality and morbidity in this population, politicians and public health authorities have not adequately considered the medical and psychosocial effects of the pandemic on children. This is true despite the multiple media reports of the vast impact of COVID on the physical and mental health of children. For example, the New York Times reported that Clark County, Nevada re-opened schools last month after receiving over 3,000 mental health alerts in combination with an alarming number of 18 student suicides by the end of December. In addition, the CDC has reported increased emergency visits attributable to mental health conditions in children during the early stages of the pandemic. Compared to the prior year, emergent mental health-related visits increased 24% (5-11 y.o.) and 31% (12-17 y.o.) during March to October 2020. School-age children frequently report a feeling of \"hopelessness\" and there are data that these mental health issues may be predictive of illness in adulthood. Reducing social isolation by returning to school will greatly contribute to amelioration of these symptoms. Another worrisome consequence of the pandemic is the decrease in child abuse and neglect reporting. In addition to local (New Hampshire and Massachusetts) anecdotal reports of decreases in reporting, recent studies have demonstrated a decrease in reports to both social service organizations and emergency departments. With schools closed and students socially isolated, there are fewer interactions that may alert school personnel, extended family and friends to potential cases of neglect/abuse. The benefits of a return to school are two-fold: family stress reduction and increased daily observations of at-risk children. Granted, timely school re-opening may increase exposure to COVID infection. However, with the exception of a rare but severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome, children fortunately suffer few short- and long-term complications of the infection. More data are necessary for a definitive statement but, as of now, the psychosocial damage of pandemic isolation seems to outweigh the risk of exposure in a school setting. Moreover, we cannot afford to wait for a pediatric vaccine as manufacturers have not prioritized children in their safety and efficacy studies. Although the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNtech vaccines are approved for older teenagers, trials in younger children are in the nascent stage. It may be close to a year before enough data are available to determine the dose, efficacy and safety of COVID vaccine in pre-teen children. There may be other compelling arguments in addition to those above. But it is clear that child welfare is best served by returning students to school as soon as possible. To safely open schools, it should be obvious that teachers and school personnel require vaccination. In combination with good hygiene, masks, and routine testing, it should be safe for schools to re-open with minimal risks. We cannot, however, ask educators to assume personal risk without access to the vaccine. It is time to designate teachers for what they are to our children\u2014essential. And it is time to move them up in the COVID vaccine line. Our children's health is dependent on school attendance and open schools require vaccinated teachers. "}
