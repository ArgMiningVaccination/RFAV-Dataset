Chinese Medicine is a safe and effective way to treat and prevent illnesses. It has been used for thousands of years, with Chinese Medical texts existing since 2000 B.C. Today, it offers us a holistic and natural way to heal when used in concert with Western Medicine. The basic premise of Chinese Medicine is to harmonize the body by balancing the Yin and Yang aspects of the body (balancing the body's heat/cold, excesses/deficiencies, etc.). This balancing of these aspects of the body helps allow for the Qi (energy) of the body to flow properly and naturally, allowing for the body to work at its' best. Harmony equals health and where there is health, there is prevention from disease. Even if you are not \"sick\" or have any western medical diagnosis, it is important to receive acupuncture regularly as a way to prevent future illness from arising. Many people have found relief from problems that they originally had accepted as an \"age related problem\", or even \"growing pains\". Traditional Chinese Medical modalities include: Acupuncture is the use of sterile, one-time use, hair-thin needles which are inserted with minimum sensation, into acupuncture points located throughout the body for a period of up to 30 minutes. This directly connects to the Qi (energy) flow of the body so as to move any stagnation that has accumulated. In Western terms, Acupuncture stimulates the central nervous system and the release of hormones and endorphins, promotes blood circulation, and creates a micro-trauma to stimulate the white blood cells to respond to certain areas directed by the needles. Chinese Herbal Medicine is the use of a variety FDA approved herbs to form a specific formula tailored to the specific individual needs of each patient. Herbal medicines are prescribed in whole herb form to be decocted into a brew by the patient, or in a powdered granular form to be mixed with hot water or even in prepared pill form. Herbal medicine is very safe and can be very effective when directed by a certified Chinese Herbalist. Tui-Na Massage is a form of hands-on Chinese Medical massage that helps with many musculo-skeletal problems, is beneficial to the central nervous system, benefits the sinews, promotes relaxation, promotes circulation, and helps maintain overall well being. Tui-Na is provided by a professional Chinese Medicine practitioner and is done with the patient fully clothed. Moxibustion is the use of the herb Mugwort, which is safely burned, to warm up certain parts of the patient's body or certain acupuncture points in order to promote proper circulation of Qi (energy) and blood, nourish the body, help expel \"cold\" and even \"dampness\" from the body to help relieve pain and aches, and is also good for overall general health. Moxibustion is used often in Chinese Medicine for a variety of illnesses. Gua Sha is the use of a dull edged massage tool, or even the side of a Chinese soup spoon, to gently scrape at the skin layer of the patient until some purple marks are made and thus heat and toxins accumulated over time from stress or trauma is released from the skin and muscle layer. This leaves a bruising mark which generally goes away within a day or two. This is used in Chinese Medicine for muscle pain or tightness, back pain, and a variety of other problems. Cupping is the use of glass or plastic cups that use suction to remove heat and stagnation in the body. The cupping causes purple or red bruising on the skin which goes away in a few days. It is beneficial for a variety of complaints from back pain to the common cold. Chinese Dietary Therapy is given regularly with a Chinese Medicine treatment. What one puts into the body every day has a major impact on the body and mind of a patient, and most diseases seemingly start from what is regularly ingested. Understanding that all foods have certain energies to them that can benefit or harm individuals differently can help each patient learn how to take control of their health in the daily ritual of eating. Qi Gong and Tai Qi exercises can be beneficial to many as a method of healing and is beneficial to all as a method of preventative medicine. Some basic exercises are often given in a Chinese Medical treatment in order to boost the body's natural healing ability and to regularly help move blockages in the body which prevent healing. Chinese Medicine is an ancient method of healing which can help you feel better today. Thank you for your interest in Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine. I look forward to working with you and helping you bring your health back into your own hands. "}
