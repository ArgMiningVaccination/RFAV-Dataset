However, the vaccine's effects on decreasing the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) development in such patients remain unclear. Methods: We retrospectively analysed the data of 37,117 patients with hypertension (55 years old) from the National Health Insurance Research Database during 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2012. After a 1:1 propensity score matching by the year of diagnosis, we divided the patients into vaccinated (n = 15,961) and unvaccinated groups (n = 21,156). Results: In vaccinated group, significantly higher prevalence of comorbidities such as diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, dyslipidemia, heart and liver disease were observed compared with unvaccinated group. After adjusting age, sex, comorbidities, medications (anti-hypertensive agents, metformin, aspirin and statin), level of urbanization and monthly incomes, significantly lower risk of CKD occurrence was observed among vaccinated patients in influenza season, non-influenza season and all season (Adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.39, 95% confidence level [C.I.]: 0.33-0.46; 0.38, 95% C.I.: 0.31-0.45; 0.38, 95% C.I.: 0.34-0.44, respectively). The risk of hemodialysis significantly decreased after vaccination (aHR: 0.40, 95% C.I.: 0.30-0.53; 0.42, 95% C.I.: 0.31-0.57; 0.41, 95% C.I.: 0.33-0.51, during influenza season, non-influenza season and all season). In sensitivity analysis, patients with different sex, elder and non-elder age, with or without comorbidities and with or without medications had significant decreased risk of CKD occurrence and underwent hemodialysis after vaccination. Moreover, the potential protective effect appeared to be dose-dependent. Conclusions: Influenza vaccination decreases the risk of CKD among patients with hypertension and also decrease the risk of receiving renal replacement therapy. Its potential protective effects are dose-dependent and persist during both influenza and noninfluenza seasons.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-06-14", "cleaned_text": "The Association between Influenza Vaccine and Risk of Chronic Kidney Disease/Dialysis in Patients with [1](#B1-vaccines-11-01098)]. The presence of hypertension increases risk of renal disease and is an independent predictor of decreased glomerular filtration rate in the general population [ [2](#B2-vaccines-11-01098)]. During middle and old age, blood pressure has direct and strong relationship with vascular and overall mortality [ [3](#B3-vaccines-11-01098)]. The prevalence of hypertension in developing countries is increasing rapidly and the health burden of hypertension is growing worldwide [ [4](#B4-vaccines-11-01098)]. The interaction between neurohormonal, renal, vascular mechanisms contributes different hemodynamic forms of hypertension. Over the nature course of hypertension, early endothelial dysfunction and increasing cardiac output usually progress into the late stage with increased peripheral vascular resistance and subsequently end organ damage with irreversible changes. [5](#B5-vaccines-11-01098)]. Several studies showed that CKD was associated with multiple complications and increased risk of cardiovascular disease [ [6](#B6-vaccines-11-01098)]. Inflammation is the complex response of the tissue to various injuries. Inflammation can contribute to the progression of CKD by inducing cytokine release, increasing adhesion molecule production, and activating inflammatory cells [ [7](#B7-vaccines-11-01098)]. Influenza viruses are one of most important causes of respiratory tract infection and cause widespread morbidity and mortality by inducing severe immunopathology of multiple organs with excessive innate immune response, resulting in 3-5 million infections and 250,000-500,000 lethal patients annually [ [8](#B8-vaccines-11-01098), [9](#B9-vaccines-11-01098), [10](#B10-vaccines-11-01098)]. Complications of influenza include pneumonia, myositis, rhabdomyolysis, kidney injury, neurological diseases, and cardiovascular diseases [ [11](#B11-vaccines-11-01098)]. Although most influenza infections are self-limited, severe complications of influenza in elderly patients can result in hospitalization or death [ [12](#B12-vaccines-11-01098)]. Renal complications of influenza virus infection are uncommon but might be dangerous and lethal, reported by several studies [ [13](#B13-vaccines-11-01098), [14](#B14-vaccines-11-01098)]. [15](#B15-vaccines-11-01098), [16](#B16-vaccines-11-01098)]. In a study by Kristin, influenza vaccination in the elderly was associated with reduced risk of hospitalization for heart disease and cerebrovascular disease [ [17](#B17-vaccines-11-01098)]. In a global meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, the use of influenza vaccination significantly decreased the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, especially in the highest-risk patients with more active coronary artery disease [ [18](#B18-vaccines-11-01098)]. Although lots of studies investigated the protective effect of influenza vaccine on cardiovascular diseases and confirmed the benefit, the effect of influenza vaccine on renal complications is still unknown. In order to clarify the potential benefit of influenza vaccination on kidney diseases in a group of the elderly Taiwanese patients with hypertension with high risk of developing CKD, we conducted a population-based cohort study using reimbursement claims from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Source 2.2. Study Cohort [Figure 1](#vaccines-11-01098-f001)). In addition, a 1-year washout period (2000) was included to ensure that all patients in this cohort had no CKD or dialysis before enrollment. The influenza vaccines were all given by intramuscular injection. The vaccination status was recognized based on the presence of code V048 or the use of the vaccine [confirmed by drug codes of vaccine, Novartis, UK)]. The primary endpoints of our study were the incidence of CKD (ICD-9-CM code 585.X) and the requirement of dialysis (NHI procedure codes) in patients with hypertension. All cohorts were followed up until the date of the diagnosis of CKD, dialysis, death, disenrollment from the NHI, or the end of 2012. 2.3. Potential Confounders 2.4. Statistical Analysis [Table 1](#vaccines-11-01098-t001)). Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test to determine the significance of differences between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups in terms of the relationship among characteristics listed in [Table 1](#vaccines-11-01098-t001). The unvaccinated group served as the reference arm. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between influenza vaccination and the risks of CKD and dialysis in patients with Hypertension were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression. To examine the dose effect of influenza vaccination on the incidence of CKD and dialysis, we categorized patients into four groups by vaccination status: unvaccinated and those receiving 1, 2-3, and 4 vaccination, respectively. These data were stratified according to patients' age, sex, comorbidity, and associated medication use. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the difference and consistency between the use of influenza vaccination and the risks of CKD and dialysis in patients with Hypertension. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 and SAS 9.4 software. A p value of <0.05 indicated statistical significance. 3. Results 3.1. Baseline Characteristics of Study Population [Table 1](#vaccines-11-01098-t001)showed the baseline characteristics of the whole cohort, unvaccinated group and vaccinated group. In vaccinated group, there were more patients with diabetes (43.54% vs. 37.89%, p < 0.001), cerebrovascular disease 0.001), heart diseases vs. 52.99%, p < 0.001), hepatitis C infection (4.46% vs. 3.97%, p = 0.002) and asthma (29.19% vs. 19.32%, p < 0.001). In the past medication history, vaccinated group had greater prescription of all class of antihypertension agents, long term (>365 days) statin, metformin and aspirin usage. 3.2. Risk of Developing Chronic Kidney Disease [Table 2](#vaccines-11-01098-t002)). 3.3. Risk of Receiving Hemodialysis [Table 3](#vaccines-11-01098-t003)). 3.4. Sensitivity Analysis of Vaccination in CKD Occurrence [Table 4](#vaccines-11-01098-t004)). Subgroup analysis showed either patients with age < 65 or 65 year-old, the risk of CKD had significantly reduced after receiving more times of age < 65 year-old, receiving 1, 2-3 and 4 age 65 year-old, receiving 1, 2-3 and 4 times of vaccination respectively). Both female and male patients had significantly greater reduction of risk of developing CKD after receiving more times of vaccination 0.31 [95% female 4 times male patients, receiving 1, 2-3 and 4 times of vaccination respectively). In patients without diabetes, the risk of CKD decreased after receiving more than 2 times of 1, 2-3 and 4 times of vaccination respectively). Patients with diabetes had decreased risk of CKD after receiving more than one time of vaccination and the risk had significantly decreased by more times of 2-3 and 4 times of vaccination respectively). Patients with prescriptions of all types of antihypertensive medications had lower risk of CKD by receiving one time of vaccination and had more significant decreasing risk of CKD than 4 times of 2-3 and 4 times of vaccination respectively). Further subgroup analysis showed all patients who had prescription of diuretic, betablocker, calcium channel blocker and renin-angiotensin antagonist had decreased risk of CKD by receiving more times of vaccination. The patients who did not have the abovementioned antihypertensive medications also had significant decreasing risk of CKD. Patients with duration of statin usage history less than 28 days had significant decreased risk of CKD by receiving 1, 2-3 times and more than 4 duration of metformin less than 28 days, 28-365 days and more than 365 days had lower risk of CKD by receiving more times of vaccination. Patients with duration of aspirin usage history less than 28 days had significant decreased risk of CKD by receiving 1, 2-3 times and more than 4 season and all seasons, significant trend of lowering risk of CKD by receiving more times of vaccination 2-3 and 4 times of vaccination, in non-influenza season and all season respectively) ( [Table 5](#vaccines-11-01098-t005)and [Table 6](#vaccines-11-01098-t006)). 3.5. Sensitivity Analysis of Vaccination in Undergoing Hemodialysis [Table 7](#vaccines-11-01098-t007)showed the reduction of risk of receiving hemodialysis in patients during influenza season. By receiving more times of vaccination, the risk of receiving hemodialysis decreased after adjusting age, sex, comorbidities and 2-3 and 4 times of vaccination respectively). Patients in age less than 65 years old had reduction of risk of receiving hemodialysis after receiving more than 2 times of 1, 2-3 and 4 times of vaccination respectively). In patients elder than 65 years old, the risk of hemodialysis decreased after 1 time of 1, 2-3 and 4 times of vaccination respectively). Female patients had reduced risk of undergoing hemodialysis after 1 time 2-3 and 4 times of vaccination respectively). Male patients had reduced risk of undergoing hemodialysis after receiving more than 2 times of 2-3 and 4 times of vaccination respectively). Patients with and without diabetes had reduced risk of receiving hemodialysis after more than 2 times of 1, 2-3 and 4 times of vaccination among patient with and without diabetes respectively). Patients with and without heart disease had reduced risk of receiving hemodialysis after more than 2 times of and 4 times of vaccination among patient with and without heart disease respectively). Patients with cerebrovascular disease had reduced risk of receiving hemodialysis after more than 4 times 2-3 and 4 times of respectively). Patients without cerebrovascular disease had reduced risk of receiving hemodialysis after 1 time of 4 times of respectively). In patients who took antihypertensive agents for less than 28 days, the risk of receiving hemodialysis decreased after more than 2 times of 4 times of respectively). Patents who took antihypertensive agents more than 28 days had decreased risk of receiving hemodialysis after 1 time of of respectively). Patients who took either diuretic agent, beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker or RAA for more than 28 days all had decreased risk of receiving hemodialysis after more than 2 times of vaccination. Patients who took statin either for less than 28 days, 28-365 days and more than 365 days had decreased risk of hemodialysis after more than 2 times of vaccination. Patients who took metformin less than 28 days had reduced risk of hemodialysis after 1 time 2-3 and 4 times of respectively). In patients who took metformin more than 365 days, the risk of receiving hemodialysis reduced after more than 4 times 2-3 and 4 times of respectively). Patients who took aspirin for less than 28 days had reduced risk of receiving hemodialysis after 1 time of vaccination 2-3 and 4 times of respectively). Patients took aspirin for more than 365 days had no reduction of hemodialysis risk after taking 1, 2-3 or more than 4 times of significant reduced risk of receiving hemodialysis was observed after taking more than 2 times times of respectively) ( [Table 8](#vaccines-11-01098-t008)). In all season, risk of receiving hemodialysis significantly reduced after taking more than 1 times of (aHR: [Table 9](#vaccines-11-01098-t009)). 4. Discussion [19](#B19-vaccines-11-01098), [20](#B20-vaccines-11-01098)]. In Hanratty's a medium 3.67-year follow-up, 12.1% of 43,305 hypertensive patients developed CKD and systolic blood pressure was found associated with incident CKD [ [21](#B21-vaccines-11-01098)]. Hypertension has been an important risk factor for CKD and responsible for 27% of all end-stage renal disease(ESRD) patients in America [ [22](#B22-vaccines-11-01098)]. Besides, infections, such as urinary tract infection, are also known associated with renal cell damage and scarring, leading to CKD and ESRD [ [23](#B23-vaccines-11-01098)]. Sepsis often results in multiple organ dysfunction and acute kidney injury, occurring in about 19% patients with moderate sepsis, 23% with severe sepsis, and 51% with septic shock [ [24](#B24-vaccines-11-01098)]. Certain studies demonstrated that inflammation played a pivotal role in kidney function decline and the pathogenesis of CKD [ [25](#B25-vaccines-11-01098), [26](#B26-vaccines-11-01098), [27](#B27-vaccines-11-01098), [28](#B28-vaccines-11-01098), [29](#B29-vaccines-11-01098)]. Hypertension infection are major risk factors contributing to CKD. [30](#B30-vaccines-11-01098)]. Since then, although renal complications of influenza were uncommon, small series of influenza virus infection complicated by renal failure were still reported constantly. The renal complications of influenza infection include acute kidney injury (AKI), rhabdomyolysis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, tubulointerstitial nephritis. In Watanabe et al.'s study, in 45 hospitalized children with influenza A virus infection, 24.4% of the patients had renal involvement and sepsis with multiple organ failure [ [31](#B31-vaccines-11-01098)]. According to certain studies, approximately one third of patients with influenza virus infection during hospitalization developed AKI and some even required renal replacement therapy [ [32](#B32-vaccines-11-01098), [33](#B33-vaccines-11-01098), [34](#B34-vaccines-11-01098)]. [35](#B35-vaccines-11-01098)]. Another study demonstrated 21 patients who died of influenza infection all exhibited mild to moderate severity of ATN and four patients had myoglobin pigment deposited in the renal tubules [ [36](#B36-vaccines-11-01098)]. Carmona et al. analyzed the autopsy findings of five patients who died of influenza infection and found ATN existed in all patients without evidence of direct virus-induced kidney injury [ [37](#B37-vaccines-11-01098)]. These researches implicate ATN often complicate patients with influenza infection and leading to kidney injury. Rhabdomyolysis is a lethal-threatening syndrome characterized by the release of muscle contents, including electrolytes, myoglobin, enzymes, and other sarcoplasmic proteins into the circulatory system. Acute kidney injury is a quite common complication that developed in 13% to approximately 50% patients with rhabdomyolysis [ [38](#B38-vaccines-11-01098), [39](#B39-vaccines-11-01098)]. Several studies had indicated that influenza virus infection was associated with rhabdomyolysis and led to kidney injury [ [40](#B40-vaccines-11-01098), [41](#B41-vaccines-11-01098)]. There were also some studies showing that influenza virus could be detected in urine and implicated that influenza virus would directly invade the urinary system and lead to kidney injury [ [42](#B42-vaccines-11-01098), [43](#B43-vaccines-11-01098)]. In addition, influenza infection would evoke cell mediated immunity with secretion of Th17 and Th1 cytokines. Dysregulation of cytokine expression due to viral antigen deposition in the kidney results in T-cell mediated kidney injury was found in patients with influenza virus infection [ [44](#B44-vaccines-11-01098)]. 5.
