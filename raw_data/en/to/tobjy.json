What is the Language Server Protocol? Adding features like auto complete, go to definition, or documentation on hover for a programming language takes significant effort. Traditionally this work had to be repeated for each development tool, as each tool provides different APIs for implementing the same feature. A Language Server is meant to provide the language-specific smarts and communicate with development tools over a protocol that enables inter-process communication. The idea behind the Language Server Protocol (LSP) is to standardize the protocol for how such servers and development tools communicate. This way, a single Language Server can be re-used in multiple development tools, which in turn can support multiple languages with minimal effort. LSP is a win for both language providers and tooling vendors!

LSIF defines a graph format to store information about programming artifacts. Specification The latest version of the LSP specification is version 3.17. There is now also a specification for the upcoming language server index format (LSIF). Implementations The LSP has been implemented for many languages and many development tools are integrating these language servers. "}
