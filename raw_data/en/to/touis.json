It was a joint activity between the PAHO's Divisionof Health Systems and Services Development and the WHO's Traditional Medicine Team,Department of Essential Drugs and Medicine Policies. The participants to this Working Group recommended promoting activities that support the better knowledge of the traditional, complementary and alternative medicines and therapies toidentify strategies to contribute to the organization and delivery of comprehensive and culturally appropriate health systems and services in the Americas. The participants also recommended to strengthen the collaboration between WHO-HQ and PAHO and to enhance coordination between PAHO and the WHO Collaborating Centersin traditional medicine, especially those in the Region of the Americas. The Centers are theUniversity of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), and The National Center for Complementary andAlternative Medicine of the National Institute of Health (NCCAM-NIH). The topic of indigenous medicine of the Americas, as a cultural expression of the peoples, deserved special consideration in recognition to its contributions to the health of thepopulation. Since 1993, PAHO's work on indigenous medicine has been carried out under the framework of the Health of the Indigenous Peoples Initiative. The Health of the IndigenousPeoples Initiative signifies a commitment by PAHO and Member States to work withindigenous peoples to improve their health and well being. In 1997, Resolution CD37.R5 was approved and ratified through Resolution CD40.R6. This Resolution calls to the attention of Member States that renewal of the goal of health for allrequires that sustainable solutions are found to address the economic, geographic, and culturalbarriers to adequate care for vulnerable groups, including indigenous peoples. During 2000-2001 the Plan developed by the working group in November 1999, which included activities integral to implementing the Health of Indigenous Peoples Initiative wascarried out. The specific areas of work included: ! Herbal Medicine ! Indigenous Medicine and ! Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicines and Therapies. Major activities during the 2000-2001 period included a Regional workshop on Regulation of Medicinal Plants held in Jamaica in November 2000, a Regional workshop on NationalPolicy on Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine and the implementation of theproject, Promoting Indigenous Medicine in Primary Health Care.BACKGROUND 2The Region also participated in the development of the Global Strategy for Traditional Medicine in WHO presented in Annex A and the global meeting held in Ottawa, Canada todevelop a second Monograph on Medicinal Plants. An evaluation of the activities carried out as part of the 2000-2001 Plan and proposal for a new Plan of Work for 2002-2003, maintaining the same specific areas but within theframework of the Global Strategy for Traditional Medicine, is provided. The document isintended to form the basis for resource mobilization as well as to be the foundation forarranging joint efforts with existing and proposed WHO Collaborating Centers in TraditionalMedicine.31. EVALUATION OF PLAN OF WORK 2000-2001 1.1 HERBAL MEDICINE 1.1.1 Workshop on Regulation of Medicinal Plants The workshop on Regulation of Medicinal Plants was held in Jamaica in November 2000. Regulators from eleven different countries participated at the meting. A background documentwas prepared for the meeting. Participants analyzed the status of regulation of medicinal plantsin the Region. Recommendations from the group include: the promotion of regulation of herbal products; the establishment of a surveillance program on herbal products, and the establishment of a working group on herbal medicine as part of the Pan American Network on Drug Regulatory Harmonization Initiative. The group also agreed on a set of minimum requirements for herbal product registration. The report is available in English and Spanish through the PAHO Web site. 1.1.2 Other activities in herbal medicine Translation of WHO document about the regulatory situation of herbal medicine was completed. More than 500 copies were distributed in the Region and in Spanish speakingcountries in other regions. Information about the regulatory situation of herbal medicine within AMRO Member States was updated. The background document for the workshop on Herbal Medicinal Plants was prepared.The gathering and dissemination of general and evidence based information is an ongoing activity. 1.2 INDIGENOUS MEDICINE The following activities were proposed in the area of indigenous medicines and therapies for 2000-2001: Disseminate English and Spanish version of the Inventory on Traditional Medicine. Gather and disseminate general and evidenced-based information.EVALUATION OF PLAN OF WORK 2000-2001 4 Formulate and implement project 2000: \"Frameworks for the promotion of the indigenous medicine and therapies in primary health care\". The evaluation of these activities is summarized as follows: 1.2.1 Disseminate English and Spanish version of the inventory on traditional medicine The inventory was published as \"Traditional Health Systems in Latin America and the Caribbean: Baseline Information\" and included as document No 13 in the Health of theIndigenous Peoples Series. English and Spanish versions are available and have beendisseminated to all the PAHO/WHO Documentation Centers and to people and institutions that have requested them. 1.2.2 Gather and disseminate general and evidenced-based information In addition to the Health of the Indigenous Peoples Initiative list of publications, 223 (two hundred twenty three) documents in English and Spanish on indigenous medicines andtherapies have been included in the Electronic Database on Health of the Indigenous Peoples.The Database is available for users of the Internet in the following address:www.paho.org/spanish/hsp/hso/dbshow.asp 1.2.3 Formulate and implement project 2000: \"Frameworks for the promotion of the indigenous medicine and therapies in primary health care\" The project aimed to systematize information in countries on specific indigenous health systems i.e., Mapuche medicine, Maya medicine, Aymara medicine, Nahuat medicine, Miskitomedicine, Amazon medicine. Six case studies were conducted on specific health systems withthe following indigenous peoples: Gar\u00edfuna and Quechua fromPeru. The studies were published in the Health of the Indigenous Peoples Series and areavailable through the PAHO WEB. The El Salvador case was also published in the Series:Pueblos Indigenas, Salud y Condiciones de Vida en El Salvador. Based on the results of the case studies and of the Regional Workshop, a working document called \"Harmonization of Indigenous Health Systems with the Conventional HealthSystem: Strategies for Incorporating Indigenous Perspectives, Medicines, and Therapies intoPrimary Health Care\" was prepared. The document, currently under review, is available inEnglish and Spanish. The preparation of the case studies presented an important opportunity for the participating countries and PAHO to identify strengths and challenges in the articulationbetween the conventional and indigenous health systems. The process was modified becausefunding was not available for national workshops to socialize the results of the studies in allcases. A workshop was held in El Salvador with participation by indigenous leaders fromEcuador to analyze the experiences in those two countries and contribute to the ongoingtransformation of the services in El Salvador with an intercultural approach. Further efforts willfocus on supporting national processes in countries that have an interest in the recognition ofmedicines and indigenous therapies in primary health care.TRADITIONAL , COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINES AND THERAPIES 5A partnership was developed with Pro-Cultura, an NGO with extensive experience in promoting the recognition of the contribution of indigenous cultures and indigenous medicinesto societies around the world. They provided funding and technical support for the Workshopon Promotion of Indigenous Medicines and Therapies in Primary Health Care. They alsoproposed the incorporation of several of the case studies and a workshop for the review of thedocument on strategies for the harmonization of the indigenous health systems and theconventional health system in the Conference \"Indigenous Medical Traditions of theAmericas\". The conference, which was postponed from November 2001, is now planned forNovember 14-17, 2002. More information on the Conference can be obtained through theWEB at www.procultura.org. The implementation of the different stages of the project contributed to enhance the comprehension of aspects to take into account challenges in the achievement of theharmonization of the indigenous and conventional health systems. The 6 case studies respondto the need for presenting evidence-based information and to identify best practices. It is worthreiterating the importance of continuing the support for the processes under way in thecountries in the generation of culturally appropriate models of health care that considerindigenous medicines and therapies as important health resources. 1.3 TRADITIONAL, COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINES AND THERAPIES The specific activities planned in this area were: Dissemination of information to countries. A workshop on national policy on traditional, complementary and alternative medicine in 2002. 1.3.1 Dissemination of information to countries Countries continue to request information through PAHO country offices. Materials provided by the Global Program are disseminated and some requests are forwarded to one ormore WHO Collaborating Centers depending upon the nature of the request. See Web Sites ! WHO ! PAHO ! University of Illinois at Chicago, School of Pharmacy ! NIH-The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine 1.3.2 Workshop on national policy on traditional, complementary and alternative medicineEVALUATION OF PLAN OF WORK 2000-2001 6The objective of the workshop held in Guatemala in March 2001 was to know about the policies, regulations, plans and programs related to alternative and complementary medicineand practices in selected countries of the PAHO Region. More than 40 participants attendedfrom 11 countries representing Ministries of Health, universities, indigenous organizations,health and development NGO's, WHO, PAHO, and WHO/PAHO Collaborating Centers. The current status, advances/best practice and unresolved issues of traditional and complementary medicine in member states were brought forth during the countrypresentations. The details of the country experiences together with the specificrecommendations are reflected in the report. The report in English and Spanish is availablethrough the PAHO Web site. 1.4 OTHER ACTIVITIES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS DURING 2000-2001 !
