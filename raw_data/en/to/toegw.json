I inherited the abilities of clairvoyance, clairaudience, and clairsentience, which means that I am able to perceive information about people, places, and situations through deeply felt senses of knowing, and through images and words that appear in my mind's eyes and ears. In a session with me, I combine these abilities with my training as an intuitive, ritualist and healer. I began my study of mysticism as a child through books and meditation. In 2003, my study of ritual and the healing arts began. Since that time, I have had the privilege of learning at the feet of many teachers, elders, and healers from different traditions and lineages. In 2018, I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Spiritual Studies and Liberal Arts from Antioch University Seattle. For the last decade I have had a private practice in Seattle, and now Port Townsend, where I facilitate ritual and ceremony for individuals, local businesses, and families. I also offer training in the arts of ritual, mysticism and dreaming. I am passionate about creating healing spaces that are transformative, empowering, safe and inclusive. It is my honor and privilege to share with you what I have learned and to hold space for your healing and transformation. I look forward to working together. In gratitude, Katy (she/her pronouns) Background and Training Infinite and deep gratitude to all of my teachers. You are my inspiration, my guiding light. Thank you for sharing your wisdom, magic, love and courage with the world. Informal Education Apprenticeship Class in Nordic Spirituality and Trolldom Folk Magic; Johannes B.
