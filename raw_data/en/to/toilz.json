They can be found in most grocery stores and come in a variety of flavors, such as orange, pineapple and ginger. Manufacturers claim that these drinks boost your [immune system](https://www.osfhealthcare.org/blog/get-to-know-the-immune-system-your-bodys-defense-against-illness/), give you energy, reduce signs of aging, protect against cancer and more. But do they actually provide these benefits? What's in a wellness shot? Wellness shots usually come in 1-3 ounce bottles. While there's not enough science to back up how nutritious they actually are, they do contain ingredients that can have numerous health benefits, including: - Ginger: May ease nausea and bloating - Turmeric: May reduce inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, muscles and connective tissues - Apple cider vinegar: May help with managing [blood sugar levels](https://healthlibrary.osfhealthcare.org/Search/85,P00342) Are they safe? Wellness shots are generally safe to consume. However, it's important to consider that some of them contain herbs like [ginseng](https://healthlibrary.osfhealthcare.org/Search/19,Ginseng), which may interfere with certain medications. That's why it's important to [read the ingredients label](https://www.osfhealthcare.org/blog/watch-for-red-flags-in-nutrition-claims/) and check with your health care provider prior to consuming them. Are they worth a shot? \"The only real benefit of wellness shots is that they're a concentrated source of nutrients in a small portion. It's a lot easier to drink a 2 ounce portion of ginger juice than it is to buy ginger root, peel and juice it,\" said Ashley Simper, a registered dietitian at OSF HealthCare. Start with a well-balanced diet. However, eating a healthy, well-balanced diet is always better than resorting to alternatives, like wellness shots. According to the [U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2017/09/26/back-basics-all-about-myplate-food-groups#:~:text=As%20the%20MyPlate%20icon%20shows,key%20building%20blocks%2C%20plus%20oils.), you should be eating the following every day: - 1-2 cups of fruit - 1-4 cups of vegetables - 1-4 ounces of whole grains - 5-7 ounces of lean protein - 1-3 cups of dairy \"I would recommend spending your money on actual fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices, and not on wellness shots. If you can afford them, they're safe, but they aren't likely to be a cure for any ailment,\" Ashley said. If you're getting enough nutrients from each food group and taking a multivitamin, wellness shots should be OK to add to your routine, but they may not be worth the hype. Remember to always talk to your primary care provider first. "}
