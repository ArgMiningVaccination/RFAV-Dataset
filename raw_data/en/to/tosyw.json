They're all edible, yes, but they're also all effective natural skin care ingredients. The problem is, there's a whole laundry list of \"natural\" skin care ingredients out there. So how exactly do you differentiate between the best natural skin care ingredients and [ingredients to avoid in skincare](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-beauty/ingredients-to-avoid-in-skincare/)? First, it's important to recognize that \"natural\" can mean just about anything. There's absolutely no regulation of the use of the term in the US or anywhere else in the world (as far as our research shows). There are also some awfully poisonous and dangerous substances that occur naturally in nature, which means that not all natural ingredients are [non-toxic](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-beauty/organic-natural/) (a term that also isn't well-defined). Marketing a product or ingredient as \"natural\" is something that should be viewed with a healthy amount of suspicion\u2014 [greenwashing](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-living/what-is-greenwashing/) antennae at the ready! Fortunately, organic ingredients for skin care are a little different, as they can be backed up by certifications. Why Truly Natural Skincare Is Important We all use skin care products to some extent, whether it's a [zero-waste hand soap](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/zero-waste/zero-waste-hand-soap/) bar, a [cruelty-free moisturizer](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/best-of-sustainable-beauty/best-sustainable-ethical-moisturisers/), a [zero-waste mascara](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/zero-waste/zero-waste-mascara/)\u2014or all of the above! Because our skin is porous, it absorbs much of what is applied to it. That includes the myriad of synthetic and harmful chemicals contained in many body care products sold today. The FDA and cosmetic companies say no worries: it's just small quantities. However, no one actually knows what the long-term effects of their application are. Worse, considering that the average American woman uses products containing [163](https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2004/12/exposures-add-survey-results) unique ingredients every day, we're left to wonder about the cumulative effects of being exposed to a cocktail of chemicals (however small) on a regular basis. Fortunately, Europe has banned well over a [thousand](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/cosmetics/legislation_en) of these harmful \"natural skin care ingredients\" that should never be used because they're linked to cancer, birth defects, genetic mutation, and/or reproductive harm. Across the board, we could all do better at being ingredient list investigators. To help, we decided to dive (skin) deep into the research to come up with this list of natural skincare ingredients you can trust. The Full Low Down On Natural Skincare Ingredients [How to find the best natural skin care ingredients](#item%201) [Our approach to natural skincare ingredients](#item%202) [Glossary skincare terms](#item%203) [Natural skin care ingredients dictionary](#item%204) How To Find The Best Natural Skin Care Ingredients In previous posts we've discussed the importance of skin care products with natural ingredients including [pregnancy-safe makeup](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-beauty/pregnancy-safe-makeup/), and how we can identify safe products by either: - looking out for certifications or logos - simply reading the ingredient list But how do you know which natural skin care ingredients are actually good for you or what the best natural skin care ingredients are? There are literally thousands of them and marketing (AKA greenwashing) does a fantastic job of muddying the waters as we try to clarify our skin. To answer this, we looked at a cross-section of the best [organic and natural skin care products](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-beauty/natural-skin-care-products/) on the market. This was based on our own experience and hundreds of other raving reviews. Beyond including organic natural skin care ingredients\u2014either with [USDA organic](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/certifications/usda-organic-reliable/) or [COSMOS](https://www.ecocert.com/en-US/certification-detail/natural-and-organic-cosmetics-cosmos) certifications or clearly natural and identifiable ingredients\u2014brands also had to tick our other sustainability criteria. We then collated a list of the most common healthy skincare ingredients found across the range of products we surveyed. It's no accident that those products had the best reviews. Many of the ingredients found in them have solid scientific and research-backed evidence (which we've included links to below) of their positive benefits. Of course, we're all different. An ingredient might be perfect for one person's skin and not so good for another's. It may take a bit of trial and error but at least you'll know that each item in the list of organic skin care ingredients below is a healthy addition to any skin care product that you buy. Our Approach To Natural Skin Care Ingredients & Products We use our [sustainable and ethical beauty](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable/sustainableconsumer/) standards when looking for brands and products. Here's a quick recap: [cruelty-free](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable/cruelty-free-vs-vegan/) - vegan - non-toxic [palm oil free](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-living/palm-oil-free-sustainable/) - ethical ingredient sourcing - thoughtful, (ideally) zero waste or compostable packaging We've used these same criteria to dig up natural and organic skincare products like [organic face moisturizers](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/best-of-sustainable-beauty/best-natural-organic-face-moisturizers/) and [ natural shampoo](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-beauty/organic-natural-shampoo/), plus a selection of zero-waste products like [zero waste face wash](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/zero-waste/zero-waste-face-wash/) and [zero waste lip balms](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/zero-waste/zero-waste-lip-balm/). So, what are the best natural skin care ingredients? Let's find out! Natural Skin Care Ingredients Glossary: Buzzwords In The Skin Care Industry There's a LOT of jargon in the beauty industry. Before we move on to our natural skin ingredients dictionary, let's break down some of the commonly used terms. Antioxidants are molecules that inhibit, or stop, the oxidation of other molecules. They occur naturally in plants, animals, and plant-based foods like vegetables, tea, wine, and chocolate. Our bodies also naturally produce a complex system of antioxidants to combat oxidation or the chemical reactions that create free radicals. Emollients are waxy lubricating agents that contain a mixture of compounds used to soften, smooth, and hydrate the skin. They also contain occlusive properties, meaning they provide a layer of protection that helps prevent water loss. There are a variety of emollient ingredients including plant oils, mineral oils, shea butter, cocoa butter, triglycerides, stearates, and fatty acids like non-vegan lanolin. Emulsifiers are substances that stabilize or prevent emulsions from separating, like the combination of oil and water. Free radicals are ions or molecules that have an unpaired electron which causes them to be highly chemically reactive towards other substances, including our skin cells. They attach and bind themselves to other molecules which changes the chemical structure and results in damage or destruction of the original molecule. Thankfully, we've evolved to create important defenses (i.e. antioxidants) to protect our cells and (especially) our DNA from free radicals. Humectants are substances that attract water molecules (usually from the skin's deeper layers, like the dermis) and bring them to the epidermis or upper layer of the skin. By doing so, they prevent dryness and maintain the skin's suppleness. One of the most well-known humectants is glycerin, which naturally occurs in all lipids (i.e. fats), including our own skin. Note that a lot of humectants have emollient properties, while not all emollients have humectant properties. A combination of the two make for the best moisturizers. Sebum is a complex oily mixture of glycerides, fatty acids, wax, squalene, and cholesterol that's produced by the sebaceous glands. Except on our palms and soles, these glands are found all over our body with the highest concentration found on our back, forehead, and chin (around [2,600 to 5,800](https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/sebum/) sebaceous glands per square inch). Sebum is vital to our skin's health. It provides a layer of protection from bacteria and fungi and keeps our skin hydrated by reducing water loss from the inside while providing a waterproof shield from the outside. We need just the right amount of sebum for optimal protection, however, too much can lead to clogged pores and eventually acne. Polyphenols (also known as phenolics) are naturally occurring phytochemicals or micronutrients that are found abundantly in fruit, vegetables, red wine, tea, and plant oils to name but a few. They influence and [contribute to](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2835915/) the bitterness, astringency, color, flavor, odor, and oxidative stability of the food or liquid. Phytochemicals are important because they have potent antioxidant properties which help protect cells from free radicals. They also have a range of other positive biological effects like inhibiting angiogenesis (growth of blood vessels that feed tumors), reducing inflammation, and promoting normal blood pressure and blood sugar levels\u2014meaning some of the best healthy skincare ingredients contain them. There are 4 major types of polyphenols to look out for: - flavonoids (fruits, vegetables, legumes, red wine, and green tea) - stilbenes (red wine and peanuts) - lignans (flax, legumes, cereals, grains, fruits, and algae) - phenolic acid (coffee, blueberries, kiwifruits, plums, apples, and cherries) A Algae Description \"Algae\" is the term used to describe a large, diverse group of [eukaryotic](https://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/eukaryote-eucariote-294/) organisms that use the process of photosynthesis to survive. Similar to aquatic plants, they contain chlorophyll, but they don't have roots, stems, or leaves. What It Contains Vitamins A, B, B1, C, and E, iron, proteins, sodium, phosphorus, magnesium, copper, calcium, iodine, beta carotene, phlorotannins, and essential amino acids Uses Thanks to algae's trace elements and minerals, it helps to maintain the skin's natural functions. Algae also have antioxidant and anti-photoaging properties which have been shown to effectively inhibit skin oxidation stress and matrix metalloproteinases (i.e. enzymes that contribute to skin degradation). As a natural humectant, the ingredient can preserve moisture in the skin's upper layer. Combining anti-aging properties with an ability to trap and store moisture, it's no wonder you'll find algae as one of the top natural ingredients for skin care products. Sources Aloe Vera (Aloe barbadensis miller) Description You can find this little succulent in tropical climates all over the world. It's a versatile plant that's used in many consumer products from beverages to cosmetics to lotions. What It Contains A host of biologically active substances, including vitamins B1, B2, B6, C, choline, niacin amide, glycoprotein, enzymes, phenolic compounds, a variety of amino acids, phytochemicals and salicylic acids. Uses Aloe is one of the most commonly used natural skin care product ingredients, even if the product is less-than-natural on the whole. Besides the benefits of ingesting it (which is a whole other topic), aloe vera is most well-known for its anti-inflammatory, healing, and epidermal development properties for sunburn and wounds. Thanks to its bioactive makeup it's also been used as an antifungal, antiviral, anti-parasitic, and regenerative treatment. Like almond oil, it's effective in reducing the progression and itching of striae (stretch marks from pregnancy). With benefits for skin diseases, infections, insect bites, and more, this is an all-purpose super ingredient to look out for in skin and body care products. Just bear in mind though that moderation is key for this one as it can be pretty potent (depending on the formulation and % of aloe in the product). Sources [The National Center for Biotechnology Information (Research Article)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28289986) [The National Center for Biotechnology Information (Research Article)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27736988) [The National Center for Biotechnology Information (Research Article)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28521546) [The National Center for Biotechnology Information (Research Article)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27765096) [The National Center for Biotechnology Information (Research Article)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27778516) Apple Cider Vinegar Description The fermented liquid distilled from apple cider, ACV is cheap and has a variety of uses. You can consume it orally or apply it to your skin\u2014either way there are handy benefits. What It Contains Acetic acid, malic acid Uses For topical advantages, ACV is effective as a cleanser and toner. For treating acne, it has natural exfoliating properties that assist in balancing sebum and removing hyperkeratosis (i.e. where the outer skin cells are replaced with keratin). It also provides antifungal and antibacterial properties. Bear in mind that because it is an acid it can be sensitizing. Sources Argan Oil (Argania spinosa) Description From the fruit of the Moroccan Argan tree, this non-fragrant oil is used in both food (think: oil used for dipping bread) and cosmetics. It's packed with nutrients making it a real powerhouse ingredient for maintaining strong, supple, and elastic skin. What It Contains A very high % of lipids and fatty acids (linoleic, oleic acid, and palmitic acid), vitamins A and E (tocopherol), and other minor components (polyphenols, tocopherols, sterols, squalene, alcohols) Uses Its emollient nature assists with hydration. It has been shown to repair the skin's barrier function as well as balance and regulate the production of sebum. As with all plant oils, a diluted solution works best. This ingredient is often found in [organic baby skin care products](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/best-of-sustainable-beauty/natural-organic-baby-skin-care-products/) and [zero waste lotions](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/zero-waste/zero-waste-lotion/) for all skin types. Sources Avocado Oil (Persea gratissima) Description This is a super fatty (but nourishing) ingredient. It's one of the few plant oils that's not derived from seeds but rather pressed from the pulp that surrounds the avocado pip. What It Contains A heap of essential nutrients and phytochemicals, such as vitamins A, B1, B2, B12, D, and E, as well as lipids, polyhydroxylated fatty alcohols, and beta carotene Uses The natural, non-fragrant skin-replenishing and emollient plant oil has also been shown to be an effective ingredient in the long-term treatment of psoriasis. It's also used for its anti-inflammatory properties to address skin diseases like vulvar lichen sclerosis and as a protective agent against UV-induced skin damage. It provides an effective foundation for [affordable organic makeup](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/best-of-sustainable-beauty/affordable-natural-organic-makeup/). Sources B Bentonite Clay Description Bentonite clay is an absorbent aluminum-based clay and is found fairly abundantly in nature. It's named after Fort Benton, Wyoming where some of the largest deposits of the mineral are found. What It Contains Mostly [montmorillonite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montmorillonite), which is a very soft group of minerals (iron, copper, calcium, zinc, magnesium, calcium) that form crystals, commonly known as clay. Uses The use of various clays (both internally and externally) for maintaining human health dates back centuries. For skin, studies have shown that Bentonite clay is effective against irritant, allergic, and diaper dermatitis (a common skin disorder of infancy), and as a moisturizing agent for hand dermatitis. It's also been shown to efficiently heal lesions and ulcers. Some sun lotions containing specific proportions of Bentonite clay and zeolite minerals have shown a greater ability to absorb some of the highest levels of UV light. Sources C Calendula Flower (Calendula officinalis) Description Used since early history, [Calendula](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Calendula+officinalis) (commonly referred to as pot marigold) was a favorite of ancient Roman, Greek, Middle Eastern, and Indian cultures for its medicinal qualities. Today, it has a variety of uses in pharmacology and cosmetics and is one of the most important all-natural skin care ingredients. What It Contains fatty oils), oils Uses Its bio-active and antioxidant properties have been shown to promote collagen synthesis and cell tissue regeneration in the innermost part of our skin. It's effective against UV-induced oxidative stress and is used for treating a host of issues including inflammation/swelling, dry/sensitive skin, eczema, bruises, insect sting/bites, and fungal disorders like athlete's foot. This is a really useful ingredient and one to look out for in natural skin and body care products. Note: This is not to be confused with Tagetes flowers which are commonly referred to as Marigolds. The proper plant and ingredient name is Calendula officinalis. Sources Cedarwood Oil (Cedrus atlantica) Description This essential oil is derived from the foliage and wood of the cedar tree. There are several different types of cedar tree. The Atlas cedar, Cedrus atlantica which is native to the Atlas Mountains of Morocco is commonly used for therapeutic purposes. Cedarwood oil is best known as a natural fragrance but is also used in medicine, art, and cosmetics. What It Contains Terpenic hydrocarbons, sesquiterpenes, and cadinene Uses Besides its use as a woody-like fragrance, it's shown to have limited benefits as a treatment for acne, eczema, and skin eruptions. Do use carefully though as cedarwood oil, like many other natural fragrances, has been shown to aggravate the skin. It should always be diluted with carrier oils, such as coconut oil. Sources Cetearyl Alcohol Description At first, we thought this was just another harmful chemical (at least it sounds like it) but we assure you this is not t At first, we thought this was another harmful chemical but we assure you this is not the same as ethyl, or rubbing alcohol which is known to dry skin out (think: hand sanitizers). Cetearyl alcohol can be derived naturally from coconut oil (the best source), palm oil, or animals. It can also be made synthetically. What It Contains Fatty acids (mostly cetyl and stearyl alcohols) Uses Cetearyl alcohol is a useful and effective emollient and emulsifier. It's also used as a texture enhancer, thickener, and carrying agent for other ingredients which essentially helps the spreadability (e.g. foaming) of the product. Note: Also look out for Cetearyl olivate and sorbitan olivate (usually found together in cosmetic and body care solutions) which are also effective emulsifiers derived from olive oil. These ingredients are hypoallergenic so there is very little chance that they will cause an allergic reaction. Sources Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla / Anthemis chamomilla) Description There are two common varieties of chamomile: German chamomile and Roman Chamomile. In Greek, chamomile means \"earth apple\" and this ingredient is a skincare terpenoids, and Chamomile is most famous for its effective anti-inflammatory properties and its ability to penetrate the deeper layers of the skin. It's also effective for treating moderate cases of eczema. In one study, chamomile was 60% more active than 0.25% hydrocortisone cream\u2014used for swelling and inflammation. As one of the most treasured healthy skin care ingredients, it's also proven useful in dealing with skin irritations, sunburns, rashes, and sores. It's known to increase and strengthen wound healing and is used in the treatment of hemorrhoids. Sources Charcoal Description Charcoal or activated charcoal (when oxygen is added to charcoal) is just a simple form of carbon that's typically used in the medical community for treating poison and nausea. What It Contains Carbon Uses Charcoal has small, low-volume pores which significantly increase its surface area (a gram of charcoal can cover 3000m2) and in turn its absorption properties. It can absorb between 100 and 200 times its weight in impurities! Thanks to these unique qualities, anecdotal evidence shows that it's effective as a topical treatment in drawing excess oil, dirt, bacteria, poisons, and chemicals from the skin. This is why it's commonly used as a foundational ingredient in [cruelty-free deodorant](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/best-of-sustainable-beauty/cruelty-free-deodorant/) and [zero-waste deodorant](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/best-of-sustainable-beauty/zero-waste-deodorant-ideas/). It's also widely used by doctors in eliminating pungent odors from chronic wounds. Sources Cocoa (Theobroma Cacao) Description The use of cocoa in food and medicine goes back some 3000 years to the times of the Mayans and Aztecs. Apart from consuming the most popular ingredient in the world, cocoa (as an extract or butter) also has some great benefits when applied to the skin. What It Contains Bio-active phytocompounds, phenolic antioxidants (flavonoids, but the most notable and active ones are catechin, epicatechin, and procyanidins), essential minerals, vitamin E, omega-3 fatty acids, and theobromine Uses This effective natural skin emollient protects the skin by neutralizing oxidative stress. Its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties enhance the skin's photoprotection against the sun's UV rays which is crucial to skin health, which is why some [natural sunscreen brands](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-beauty/natural-sunscreen/) opt for this ingredient in their formulations. It has also been shown to inhibit the production of collagenase and elastase (i.e. enzymes that degrade skin cells) which slows the skin's aging process and reduces the risk of wrinkles. It's an effective nourishing moisturizer. If you're prone to acne, be cautious when applying cocoa butter as it can clog your pores. Sources Coconut (Cocos nucifera) Description This is one of the most versatile ingredients (for skin and food) around. A member of the palm family, coconut trees are found in tropical areas around the world. What It Contains Bio-active compounds, including triglycerides (medium chain fatty acids - mostly lauric acid, alpha tocopherol flavonoids, steroids, alkaloids, and triterpenes It contains vitamin E and it's one of the few oils that's hypoallergenic. Uses Thanks to its anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties, coconut has been used to treat chronic skin diseases like eczema, dermatitis, psoriasis, and cuts. It's also perfect for dry skin as its emollient nature and high concentration of lipids improves barrier function which provides (and maintains) the skin's hydration. Be aware though that some information out there claims that coconut oil is good for acne and sun protection but there has been no scientific evidence to back this up. Sources E Ethyl Macadamiate Description Ethyl macadamiate is a non-volatile, non-greasy, clear, colorless liquid. It's the ester of ethyl alcohol and the fatty acids derived from macadamia seed oil. Treasured as one of the best all natural ingredients for skin care, it spreads very easily and comes from the process known as [saponification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saponification) (conversion of fat or oil into soap and alcohol by using heat and an alkali). What It Contains Ethyl oleate and ethyl palmitoleate Uses It's used as a moisturizer. The antioxidant properties neutralize free radicals and scavenge reactive oxygen species. While not many studies have been conducted specifically about macadamia nuts, it's been suggested that the phenolic compounds of nuts have a higher antioxidant capacity than nutrient antioxidants such as Vitamin E and selenium. Sources Evening Primrose Oil (Oenothera biennis) Description The [evening primrose](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Oenothera+biennis) plant is native to central and eastern North America where it was used for its medicinal qualities by many Indigenous tribes including Cherokee, Iroquois, Ojibwe, and Potawatomi. They are not related to true Primroses (Primula). What It Contains Fatty acids and gamma-linolenic acid Uses It's known to have skin-soothing properties and its emollient nature helps smooth and hydrate dry and rough skin. It's also proven to be an effective ingredient in the treatment of eczema and dermatitis and assists with the absorption of other ingredients into the skin. Sources F Frankincense (Boswellia carterii) Description Interestingly, \"Frankincense\" is derived from old French which means high-quality incense. As an ingredient, it's an aromatic resin that's obtained from the Boswellia tree. It's best known for its balsamic/lemon/conifer fragrance. What It Contains Terpenes (such as monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, monoterpenoles, sesquiterpenols, and ketones) Uses Besides its property as a fragrance, this ingredient has been shown to have effective antimicrobial and antifungal activity against all microorganisms, which makes it ideal as a topical treatment for eradicating skin and nail infections like acne and eczema. Note, like most natural fragrances, frankincense can be sensitizing to the skin. Sources G Glycerin / Glycerol Description Glycerin, a non-toxic, odorless, and colorless liquid, may sound like a synthetic but this ingredient is naturally occurring in all lipids (i.e. fats), including the skin. It's usually derived from animals and plants but it can also be synthetically manufactured - look out for propylene glycol and PEG silicone. While these are considered humectants and may make your skin feel smooth and supple, they contain no nutrients, can cause skin irritation and rashes, and increase the risk of dermatitis. What It Contains A simple polyol compound, which is an alcohol made of various chemical (e.g. oxygen, hydrogen) bonds Uses Because of its humectant nature, this ingredient is a body care staple\u2014it's often used as the base formulation for [natural and organic body wash](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/best-of-sustainable-beauty/natural-organic-body-wash/), for example. It attracts, binds, and holds moisture in the epidermis (upper layer) of the skin. By doing so, it prevents dryness and maintains the skin's suppleness. Sources Green Tea (Camellia sinensis) Description Originating from China, green tea has been around since the early twelfth century and quickly spread to many other countries in Asia. Now, it's a favorite beverage the world over. What It Contains Antioxidants known as flavonoid phytochemicals or polyphenols (mainly epigallocatechin-3-gallate) Uses Its strong antioxidant, anti-carcinogenic and anti-inflammatory properties are likely to slow down the process of aging, repair or improve the appearance of sun-damaged skin, and reduce topical oxidative stress. It's also been known to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases (i.e. enzymes that contribute to skin degradation). Sources H Hemp Seed Oil (Cannabis sativa L.) Description Not to be confused with CBD oil which uses the stalks, leaves, and flowers of the hemp plant, hemp seed oil is obtained by pressing hemp seeds, those mini nutritional powerhouses used to make one of the most [sustainable plant milks](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-food/most-sustainable-milk/). It has a nutty aroma and is dark to light green in color. What It Contains Tocopherols, polyphenols, phenols, lignanamides, and omega-3 and Uses These important fatty acids offer powerful anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antifungal properties benefits, which can be used to calm irritation and inflammation from conditions like psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis, and acne rosacea, while keeping skin moisturized and nourished. Hemp seed oil also has antioxidant properties. It can improve conditions caused by reactive oxygen species and help to reduce wrinkles, fine lines, and other signs of aging. Hemp oil is also an emollient that can leave the skin feeling soft and supple. Because hemp is typically organically-grown and requires no chemical inputs (like fertilizer or pesticides), it's also one of the best organic skin care ingredients. Sources Himalayan Salt / Sea Salt (Sodium chloride) Description Himalayan salt is found in the Punjab region of Pakistan whereas sea salt is, obviously, found in the sea! What It Contains Trace minerals and nutrients, including iron, magnesium, calcium, zinc, potassium, and selenium Uses As a topical scrub, Himalayan/sea salt can be used to exfoliate and remove dead skin cells. Bear in mind this can be sensitizing if left on the skin for too long. Sources - There is no scientific evidence that any type of salt has any further benefits apart from its natural exfoliating properties. Hyaluronic Acid / HA (Hyaluronan) Description Another natural skincare ingredient that sounds less-than-natural but is. HA is a uniquely anionic and non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan that is naturally present throughout the human body in connective, epithelial, and neural tissues (skin, eyes, and synovial joint fluid). While 50% of the body's total HA is found in the skin, it is a crucial compound for joint lubrication and provides a framework through which cells can migrate. As with collagen and elastin, the body's natural HA production slows over time which leads many to seek outside sources. It can be replenished either through diet or topical application and is naturally found in potatoes, soybeans, avocados, almonds, green vegetables, and red wine. Most of the HA used in skincare is lab-produced via biofermentation of bacteria. What It Contains Antioxidants and repeating polymeric disaccharides of D-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine linked by a glucuronidic bond with a neutral pH Uses HA is a humectant with a unique molecular structure capable of attracting water molecules and containing 10,000 times its weight in water. In skincare, this gives it excellent moisture-retentive properties. It also acts as a collagen and elastin stimulant, which combines with its other soft tissue augmentative abilities to restore facial volume, fight wrinkles, and give it anti-aging properties. Aside from cosmetic uses in dermal fillers and anti-aging creams, it is also used for wound-healing and immunomodulation medical applications thanks to its anti-inflammatory and tissue-regenerative properties. Sources J Jojoba Oil (Simmondsia chinensis) Description Jojoba has a variety of names like goat nut, deer nut, quinine nut, and coffee berry. The non-fragrant oil is produced from the seed of the jojoba shrub, which is native to the west coast of the USA and northwestern Mexico. What It Contains A variety of different fatty acids (mostly eicosenoic, erucic, and oleic acid) and alcohols Uses Jojoba oil's chemical structure closely resembles human sebum (i.e. the oil or lubrication that our skin produces). It's easily absorbed into the skin and is effective as a moisturizing and balancing agent for the skin's natural oils, without clogging pores. It also has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties. Considered one of the best natural ingredients for skin care, it's not only an effective moisturizer for dry and chapped skin, but it's also useful for healing burns, sores, scars, dermatitis, acne, psoriasis, and sunburn. Keep an eye out for this one if you want to rejuvenate and enhance your skin's natural suppleness. Sources L Licorice Root Extract (Glycyrrhiza The benefits of licorice root have been well-known since the days of ancient China. Cultivated around the world, this medicinal herb is used for flavoring food, candy, beverages, and tobacco products. What It Contains Bio-active compounds known as glycyrrhizin / glycyrrhizic acid and licochalcone, and the phytoestrogen known as glabridin Uses It increases the production and migration of skin cells. It's also been shown to have antiviral, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and skin-soothing effects, and is used in the treatment of several skin disorders like rosacea, eczema, psoriasis, and dermatitis. It has a natural skin-lightening agent for the treatment of hyperpigmentation, uneven skin tone, melasma, and other pigmentation disorders of the skin. If that's not enough it's also been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties, making it useful in the treatment of acne.

There's a variety of vitamin C derivatives and it's naturally found in a heap of ingredients including rosehip, sea buckthorn, and aloe vera. However, L-ascorbic acid is the most well-studied. What It Contains A weak acid that's structurally related to glucose Uses L-ascorbic acid is a strong antioxidant that's shown to be effective as an anti-aging supplement when formulated properly (i.e. a pH level of 3.5 or less is required for the skin to absorb it). It assists in the repair of sun-damaged skin, stimulates collagen production, and has also been shown to inhibit the production of melanin and skin cancer. When L-ascorbic is applied to the skin regularly it's also been shown to even out skin tone and improve hydration. Note that like all antioxidants, L-ascorbic acid can break down fairly easily when exposed to air and light, so best to make sure the product you buy is contained in an air-tight bottle, tube, or pump. Avoid clear jars as these are susceptible to light. Sources Lavender Oil (Lavandula) Description There are about 47 species of the lavender plant and they're found in many parts of the world, including the Canary Islands, Europe, and North and East Africa. Distilled from the flower spikes of the Lavender plant, this essential oil is colorless and insoluble in water. What It Contains A complex of phytochemicals, including linalool and linalyl acetate (differs from species to species) Uses Besides its delightful fragrance, under in-vitro studies, this ingredient has been shown to promote collagen synthesis and differentiation in the skin's fibroblasts (i.e. the most common connective tissue in our skin). It's also shown to be an effective therapeutic agent in repairing skin injuries and wounds and has been used to soothe sunburn and insect bites and relieve eczema and psoriasis. Studies have also shown that it may have anti-inflammatory properties and can reduce irritation and pain. A word of caution though, as lavender is a fragrance it can naturally aggravate the skin, especially when used undiluted. Sources O Olive Oil (Olea europaea) Description Olive oil is the liquid fat obtained from olives. According to archaeological evidence, it's been cultivated between 6000-4500 BC in Palestine, and (not surprisingly) it's been used as one of the most important natural skin ingredients since the time of the ancient Egyptians and Greeks. What It Contains Essential fatty acids, the emollient squalene (i.e. one of the most common fats produced by human skin cells), phenolic compounds, and polyphenols Uses Olive oil is very effective as a moisturizer and is generally suitable for sensitive skin (appropriate in the right formulations with newborns). In vitro tests have shown the bio-active derivatives of olive oil support the production of adult fibroblasts which not only aid in the repair of the skin's connective tissue but also in the appearance of aged skin. It's also been used to treat minor skin problems like acne and is effective in healing wounds and burns. There is a very low potential for this ingredient to be sensitizing or harmful, however, it's usually combined with other natural ingredients in makeup and skincare to counteract this risk.

Originating from the Middle East, they were soon cultivated throughout the Mediterranean and northern India. There are a few good reasons why this has made the super-fruit league: namely that most of the pomegranate\u2014including its roots, bark, peel, oil, seeds, juice, and vibrant red flesh\u2014contains nutrients and beneficial compounds. What It Contains Antioxidants like polyphenols, punicalagins, and punicic acid Uses Pomegranate extract has been shown to: - reduce inflammation - strengthen the dermal membrane which protects against oxidative stress (thanks to its polyphenols) - assist in the repair of our DNA - inhibit the effects of UV-induced damage and matrix metalloproteinase (i.e. enzymes that contribute to skin degradation) - stimulate the growth of fibroblasts (the cells responsible for collagen production) which reduces wrinkle activity - promote regeneration and thickening of the epidermis Sources R Red Raspberry Seed Oil (Rubus idaeus L.) Description An oil cold-pressed from red raspberry seeds. Paleolithic caves contain the first recorded evidence of the consumption of raspberries. It is thought the Roman Empire began cultivating the plant in southeastern Europe. Today, raspberries can be found across Europe, Asia, and North America. Raspberries are well known for their consumptive health benefits, being rich in both antioxidants and a balance of essential fatty acids. What It Contains Therapeutically-beneficial bioactive phytochemical compounds including antioxidants (like Vitamin E, phenolic compounds, and tocopherol) and fatty acids (Omega 3, Omega 6, and Omega 9). Uses Red raspberry seed oil is most commonly used as a carrier oil, moisturizer, and acne solution thanks to its anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagenic, and antimicrobial properties. Acting as an emollient, it reduces oxidative stress on the skin and boosts collagen and elastin production yielding anti-aging benefits. In particular, red raspberry seed oil is valued for its natural sun-protective abilities, particularly in natural and [zero-waste sunscreen](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/zero-waste/zero-waste-sunscreen/). One study demonstrated that sunscreens enhanced with red raspberry seed oil demonstrated superior photoprotection, blocking 91% of UVA rays and 93% of UVB rays. With significant levels of antioxidants, it also protects the body from free radical damage and combats photoaging effects and damage already done by previous sun exposure.

Note that this ingredient is different from Rose Oil, an essential oil distilled from the Damask dose that has been known to aggravate the skin. Sources Rosemary Extract (Rosmarinus officinalis) Description The fragrant, woody rosemary herb is perhaps better known for its culinary and aromatherapy uses. However, there's a lot more to this one than just the scent and taste. What It Contains Bio-active phytochemicals, most importantly rosmarinic and caffeic acid Uses Rosemary extract has been used as a photo-therapeutic agent for healing wounds. It's been shown to inhibit the harmful effects of UV-induced skin damage and prevent DNA damage in certain cells. [Sustainable skincare brands](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/best-of-sustainable-beauty/sustainable-skincare/) use it for its antimicrobial and antibacterial properties, as a natural preservative to prevent other ingredients in cosmetic and skincare products from oxidizing, and also in the treatment of infections caused by bacteria. Note that while rosemary essential oil has many of the same properties, because of the high concentration of its fragrance compounds, it's been known to aggravate the skin.

It plays a very important role in cell function and development is necessary for a protein's biological activity to continue. A lot of [zero waste beauty brands](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/zero-waste/best-zero-waste-beauty-brands/) use CoQ10 in their products. Vegan sources include broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, and fermented yeast. What It Contains A fat soluble-like substance that resembles a vitamin Uses The naturally produced CoQ10 in our skin, like most things, reduces over time. It makes sense to replace what's lost and the topical application of CoQ10 has been shown to augment cellular energy metabolism, reduce free radicals, increase antioxidant effects, and beneficially affect mitochondrial function. All of this strengthens the epidermal layer of the skin, reduces the breakdown of collagen, and protects against environmental stress and photoaging\u2014which may also slow or reverse the signs of aging.
