Meyerowitz-Katz outlined his criticisms of the paper - which he called \"one of the most influential\" in the push to use vitamin D for COVID-19 - in a Medium post on April 3. The authors of a case report involving a patient who died of a rare disorder of the bone marrow have removed an image from the article after the person's mother objected to the use of the photograph. The paper, \"Dyskeratosis congenita,\" appeared in Autopsy Case Reports in 2020 and was written by a group from Upstate Medical University, part of the State University of New York system, in Syracuse. We saw the notice in November and were curious if we could learn more. So we filed a public records request for documents related to the article - and received a response last week disclosing correspondence between Robert Stoppacher, a co-author of the report, and the editor-in-chief of the journal. In a letter to the journal on Sept. 12, 2021, Stoppacher stated that: Several psychiatry researchers have been unsuccessfully seeking distance from a dodgy journal with which they're affiliated - and which has now published an article claiming homosexuality and masturbation deserve to be considered (or reconsidered, as the case may be) mental illnesses. Can you retract something that never existed in the first place? At least one journal thinks the answer to that conundrum is yes. That journal would be Medicine. In September 2020, the Wolters Kluwer journal published a paper titled \"Tranexamic acid reduces blood cost in long-segment spinal fusion surgery: A randomized controlled study protocol\" by a group in China led by Linyu Yang, of the Department of Orthopedics at the Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, in Sichuan. The article promised - but failed to deliver - a \"Table 1\", an omission the peer reviewers and journal staff missed during the production process. Five months later, said table still had not materialized, prompting the following notice: Hironobu Ueshima, formerly of Showa University Hospital in Tokyo, was found to have committed misconduct in 142 papers, according to a pair of investigations, one by his erstwhile institution and another by the Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists (JSA). We first reported on the existence of the investigation in June 2020, some three months after Australian anesthesiologist and journal editor John Loadsman raised concerns with journals involved in the case. Dilip Shah's last academic post was at Cooper University Hospital in Camden, N.J., where he worked as a post-doc in the lab of Vineet Bhandari. While there, Shah landed first authorship on a 2020 article in the European Respiratory Journal titled \"miR-184 mediates hyperoxia-induced injury by targeting cell death and angiogenesis signalling pathways in the developing lung.\" A group of heart researchers have lost two meeting abstracts after, according to one of the authors, companies said the data were proprietary and couldn't be published. But it's not clear the companies did so. The studies appeared in the journal Heart Rhythm, the official journal of the Heart Rhythm Society, and were presented at the group's 2021 annual meeting. The first author on both abstracts was Andrea Natale, a cardiac electrophysiologist at the Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute at St. David's Medical Center in Austin. We wrote about Natale in 2016, after the researcher lost a paper in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology - again based on work he presented at the Heart Rhythm Society conference about which he raised concerns over industry meddling. (Natale disputes that he was the first author on the now-retracted posters, for reasons that aren't clear to us.) Retractions are slowly stacking up for an exercise researcher in Brazil whose work has come under scrutiny by data sleuths, including a couple of his erstwhile co-authors. The concerns prompted an investigation by his former institution into one of his academic supervisors, who may be facing sanctions, Retraction Watch has learned. In June 2020, the sleuths posted a preprint calling for the retraction of seven papers by the researcher, Matheus Barbalho, a PhD student at the Centro de Ci\u00eancias Biol\u00f3gicas e da Sa\u00fade, part of the Universidade da Amaz\u00f4nia, in Bel\u00e9m. The reason, according to the sleuths - who included James Steele and James Fisher, of Solent University in the United Kingdom, both of whom were co-authors on papers with Barbalho: the data were, in their view \"atypical, improbable, and to put it "}
