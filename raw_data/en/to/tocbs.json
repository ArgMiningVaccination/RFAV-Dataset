Babies and children are not just small adults \u2014 their health care needs are different. So, it is important to find a health care professional who can provide specialized care. As a child grows and develops, a health care provider is essential for routine care as well as illnesses or injuries. A pediatrician, family practice health care provider, physician assistant, family nurse practitioner or pediatric nurse practitioner can be your child's primary care provider. The medical specialty dealing with children is called pediatrics. These providers may care for children from the time they are newborns until 21 years of age. They provide: - Well child care - Preventive health including immunizations and screening - Support - Education - Guidance for caregivers - Care for illnesses and injuries - Referrals to specialists as needed When Should My Child See a Pediatric Specialist? Your pediatrician is your go-to person for questions about your child's well-being or when your child gets sick. But sometimes, your child might have a problem that warrants a visit to a pediatric specialist. A pediatric specialist is a doctor who's received extra training in a certain area. You may need to see a pediatric specialist for additional evaluation and treatment beyond what your pediatrician is able to provide. Pediatric specialists are also experts in treating kids. They know how to perform exams in ways that make kids feel more comfortable. They often work in kid-friendly offices and use medical tools that are specially designed for use with children.
