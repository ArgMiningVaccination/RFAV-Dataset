Not all medications have an alternative, but it's still a worthwhile conversation. What are medical treatments for erectile dysfunction? There are both oral and self-injected medications that you can use to get an erection. These are one of the most common treatments to use while you get any underlying physical or psychological conditions under control. You'll usually be prescribed an oral option first because they're easier to self-administer. These are phosphodiester inhibitors that modify the smooth muscles used in an erection. These types of medications are called oral phosphodiesterase inhibitors, or PDE5 inhibitors for short. They're effective in 65% to 70% of people with ED and include: If these don't work, you can also try alprostadil. Before sex, you either insert this drug into your urethra or perform an intracavernous injection into your penis. You administer both types of medication shortly before you want to engage in sexual activity. Make sure you seek medical help if you notice any negative side effects from these medications. For example, speak with your doctor if you experience an erection that lasts longer than four hours. What ED cures don't involve medication? You don't always need to look to medication for a cure for your ED. In many cases you can consider medications as temporary solutions until some of these slower cures are able to take effect.. Exactly which steps you take will depend on what's causing your ED. For example, if your ED is due to an unhealthy lifestyle then living a healthy life will make it easier for you to get an erection. Suggestions include: Therapy and counseling services can be great treatments for many of the psychological causes of ED. Talking to someone about your worries and stress is a proven way to manage these concerns. It's sometimes enough to get your sex life back on track. You can go to sessions by yourself or with your partner. Talking to a therapist can be helpful no matter what is causing your ED. There are many new emotions \u2014 like frustration \u2014 that are associated with this condition. Therapy can help you come to terms with these new realities. There are also mechanical devices that you can use every time you want an erection. These devices are safe at any age. Just make sure that you're using them correctly. For example, there are vacuum devices that use suction to pull blood into your penis. These are the best solutions when you have trouble getting erect. Flexible, elastic rings are useful for maintaining an erection. These fit on the base of your penis and keep blood from prematurely leaving the area.

Surgery is the only permanent solution to your ED when medical, mechanical, and psychological treatment methods don't work. The surgery implants a penile prosthesis. This way you no longer need to rely on your own biological systems for your erection. The prosthetics can be semi-rigid silicone rods or inflatable devices with multiple chambers that fill with saline when you want to use them. You should discuss all of the options with your doctor to figure out the type of implant that's best for you in the long term.
