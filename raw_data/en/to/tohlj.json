Canine mammary tumors (CMTs) have been characterized extensively, as a comparative model of human breast cancers, and have been shown to have similar genetic defects and phenotypes including hormone-dependence, similar malignant tissue types, and hybrid-cell vaccines that are produced through the fusion of antigen presenting cells (APCs) with tumor cells, have been used to successfully exploit this natural defense using the mechanisms required for antigen presentation to express tumor antigens [ [15](#B15) [16](#B16) [17](#B17) [18](#B18)]. T-cell activation is vaccines are autologous and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I matched, particularly if dendritic cells (DCs) are used for antigen presentation due to their expression of MHC class I and class II molecules and necessary co-stimulatory adhesion molecules [ [15](#B15) Attempts to develop such hybrid-cell vaccine strategies in human patients have had mixed success in improving the management of disease but have demonstrated improved immune recognition and fewer adverse effects [ [15](#B15) [21](#B21) [22](#B22) [23](#B23) [24](#B24)]. Poor responses may be due to the inadequate antigen presentation or suboptimal sources of antigens or may be due to the aggressive immune suppression of autoimmunity by regulatory T cells (Tregs) [ [25](#B25) [26](#B26) [27](#B27) [28](#B28)]. Such challenges are difficult to overcome in human patients when moving directly from a mouse model because of the significant differences in biology, genetics, and natural history [ [29](#B29)]. A more similar intermediate model of spontaneous breast cancer in canine patients with an intact immune system would provide a better system for developing such therapies [ [29](#B29) [30](#B30) [31](#B31)]. [3](#B3) [4](#B4)]. Although the mechanisms for antigen presentation in this vaccine are not well described, cross-presentation between allogeneic CMTs and autologous DCs may be responsible [ [18](#B18) [24](#B24)]. The high-speed sorting technology for the isolation of low frequency circulating canine DCs from the peripheral blood developed previously has provided antigen presenting cell populations suitable for constructing patient-specific autologous hybrid-cell fusion vaccines [ [4](#B4)]. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture Mammary cancer patients [35](#B35)]. All patients were treated with a surgical resection, and the biopsies were analyzed by a board certified veterinary pathologist (E.G.M.R.). All owners were offered the same treatment benefits and cost reduction regardless of the treatment group. The overall survival (time to death) and cause of death, if known, were recorded. The breast cancer phenotype was determined as described previously [ [33](#B33)]. Follow-up data were collected from the clinical records and direct contact with the owners. This project was approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, the Auburn University College of Veterinary Medicine Clinical Research Review Committee and the Auburn University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) in AAALAC approved animal care facilities. Primary autologous DC sorting [3](#B3)]. Selectively washed populations of canine patient PBMCs were resuspended in 4 ml of flow wash buffer (FWB; filter sterilized HBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin fraction V) to block the nonspecific interactions and were incubated for a minimum of 40 min at room temperature. [3](#B3) [4](#B4)]. The cells were analyzed and sorted on a MoFlo XDP flow cytometer and a high-speed cell sorter (equipped with 405, 488, and 635 nm lasers) and the sorting parameters were managed using Summit 5.2 software (Beckman Coulter, USA). Labeled PBMC populations and sorted cell populations were maintained at 4\u00b0C. The entire PBMC populations were sorted for each animal for each vaccine production run and the sorted DC-enriched cell populations were collected sterilely into one or more tubes containing 1 mL of fetal bovine serum (FBS). After sorting, the cells were collected by centrifugation and cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco/BRL, USA) containing 10% FBS (Hyclone Laboratories Inc, USA) and including penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone (Gibco/BRL), as described previously until fusion [ [3](#B3) [4](#B4)]. Hybrid-cell fusion and vaccine preparation [3](#B3) [4](#B4)]. Mixed populations of CMT28/DCs to be fused (5 \u00d7 106 autologous DCs fused to 1 \u00d7 107 CMT cells at a ratio of 1:2 in 0.5 mL phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) were prepared, as described previously [ [3](#B3) [36](#B36)]. The fused cell population, composed of a single injectable vaccine dose (approximately 0.5 mL total/dose), was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.3 mL of sterile pyrogen-free PBS and 0.2 mL of injection-grade injection, sampling and statistics [Fig. 1](#F1)). Once the vaccination protocol was complete, including rechecks at 1 week after each vaccination, a further recheck was completed at 9 weeks after the third vaccination and then twice more at 18-week intervals covering approximately the first year. Rechecks by telephone were conducted with the owners over the second year. Further treatment of each patient, if necessary, was conducted under the standard of care and with the consent of the owners. [https://www.medcalc.org](https://www.medcalc.org)). The patients were divided into 3 groups, including the control, in which only a surgical resection was provided at the request of the owners who elected not to participate in the vaccination protocol; vaccine and Gemcitabine treated patients (cBC Vx); and lastly vaccine and Gemcitabine-treated patients, whose disease had progressed to inflammatory carcinoma (iBC Vx) before or at the beginning of the vaccination period. Statistically significant differences between all treatment groups was assessed using the Logrank test (MedCalc) and plots of the 95% confidence overlap (Eureka Statistics calculator [http://eurekastatistics.com](http://eurekastatistics.com)). RESULTS [4](#B4)]. The same strategy was employed to first isolate autologous the primary canine DCs from canine mammary cancer patient blood and then fuse them to CMT cells, as a source of breast cancer-specific immunogens, at high rates (40%-70%). The immunization of canine patients was designed to allow a direct assessment of the therapeutic effects of such vaccine strategies in a spontaneous canine breast cancer model using the dosage and formulations evaluated previously and the allogeneic CMT28 cell line, which has proven to be the most broadly immunogenic ( [Fig. 2](#F2)) [ [3](#B3) [4](#B4)]. Adjuvant therapy was to enhance the immune response nonspecifically using CpG-encoding oligonucleotides [ [14](#B14)]. Gemcitabine chemotherapy was also included because it has been putatively associated with the suppression of Treg populations that are believed to suppress autoimmune recognition [ [25](#B25) [27](#B27) [28](#B28)]. This formulation was selected because it had been shown to be free of adverse effects in laboratory beagles [ [3](#B3) [4](#B4)]. [Table 1](#T1)). The patient dogs needed to have a positive diagnosis of mammary carcinoma by histopathology (benign and mixed mammary cancers were excluded) and be greater than or equal to 6 kg in weight due to the volumes and frequency of blood draws required to construct the vaccine. In addition, the patients had to produce cell explants that could be cultured for phenotype analysis, have no prior cancer diagnosis or have been subjected to prior cancer treatment. No metastatic disease (liver or lungs) could be evident to bias the population to an earlier stage disease. Finally, the owners had to agree to complete the trial protocol, comply with surgical resection of the tumors prior to initiating the vaccine treatments and comply with a year-long series of vaccinations and recheck visits followed by a second year of telephone rechecks ( [Fig. 1](#F1)). Table 1 [Table 2](#T2)). The patient animals represented a variety of breeds and sizes of 6 kg or more. All of the animals were identified as reproductively intact female dogs representing a canine population known to be at high risk of mammary cancer [ [1](#B1)]. Of the 14 patient animals identified, 6 of the owners declined consent to enroll their animals in the trial, but elected to proceed with standard of care therapy; thus, these 6 dogs comprised the control group ( [Table 2](#T2)). These animals were compliant with all 7 enrollment criteria, had undergone a surgical resection, had a positive histologic diagnosis of mammary carcinoma, and were returned to their owners without further treatment. The follow-up interviews were conducted by telephone to determine the health and disposition, including cause and time of death. Table 2 [35](#B35)]; CMT cells from each vaccinated dog were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for breast cancer (BRCA) gene marker expression including ER, PR, and HER1-4 receptors (as noted) as previously described [ [33](#B33)]. Expression was scored on a 3-point scale of not expressed (), positively expressed (+) or highly expressed (++). Non vaccinated control dogs and one inflammatory carcinoma case were ND due to lack of availability of specimens; Days from surgical resection to the death of the animal or termination of the study; \u00a7Phenotype of canine mammary carcinoma cells including Luminal A (A), Luminal B (B) or HER1-4+ (1-4+) determined as described previously [ [33](#B33)]; Dogs surviving through termination of the study (days to death beyond these limits unknown). [Table 2](#T2)). All 4 members of this population were identified initially as being mammary carcinoma patients. On the other hand, all 4 developed inflammatory mammary carcinoma following surgery but prior to (2 cases), or just following (2 cases), the first vaccination at the beginning of the treatment period. The animals that developed inflammatory carcinoma were segregated into a separate treatment group because of the aggressive nature and poor prognosis of this mammary cancer subtype (inflammatory mammary carcinoma, [Table 2](#T2)). The remaining 4 patient animals comprised the canine breast cancer (cBC) vaccine and gemcitabine chemotherapy treatment group ( [Table 2](#T2)). Six animals in these last 2 patient groups completed the full treatment protocol; 2 of the inflammatory carcinoma patients died prior to completion of the last injection in the vaccine series. The patient animals in each group were all of different breeds and were comparable with respect to age and weight range for these small groups, reducing this as a source of bias between the treatment groups. The cBC Vx group ranged from 4-12 years and 15-29 kg, whereas the iBC Vx group ranged from 7-11 years and 6-28.4 kg and the control mammary carcinoma group (control) ranged from 8-12 years and ( cBC Vx group, the phenotypes were all Luminal B with but one exception of luminal A. All cBC Vx cases were also HER4+ and all but one of the Luminal B tumors were HER3+, as was the luminal A tumor ( [Table 2](#T2)). The iBC Vx group phenotypes were all Luminal B and only one was HER3+ whereas all were HER4 positive. The phenotypes for the control mammary carcinoma group (control) and one of the inflammatory mammary carcinoma tumors were not determined due to a lack of specimens to assess ( [Table 2](#T2)). [Fig. 3](#F3)and [Table 3](#T3)). Median survival carcinoma patient animals in the vaccine and Gemcitabine treatment group (cBC Vx - median survival of 611 days) were prolonged approximately 3.3-fold compared to survival of the control group (median survival 184 days) and also were anecdotally reported by the owners to have exhibited an enhanced quality of life when compared to the period prior to treatment during follow-up interviews ( [Tables 2](#T2)and [3](#T3), [Fig. 4](#F4)). These differences were analyzed using the log-rank test and were statistically significant among all groups (p = 0.0019, [Table 3](#T3)). The areas representing the 95% confidence levels between the vaccinated breast cancer and control treatment groups overlapped only peripherally largely due to the higher variation in survival times encountered in the control group ( [Fig. 4](#F4)). The differences between the vaccinated and control animal survival times represent a median increase in the observed survival of approximately 14 months for vaccinated animals when compared to the control group. For these 2 experimental groups, contact with the owners of the last few patient animals was lost after 23 months survival for the vaccine (2 animals) and after 29 months for the control group (one animal). Only one surviving vaccinated animal reported any recurrence at that time. Table 3 | data also suggests that vaccination had little or no effect on the progression of disease in these breast cancer cases possibly because the rapid progression of disease may not have allowed for a treatment response. DISCUSSION [7](#B7) [38](#B38) [39](#B39)]. Patients in both species also share similar genetics, histologic appearance, biological behavior, molecular targets, and therapeutic response to treatment [ [7](#B7) [39](#B39)]. Both human and canine breast cancers exhibit cellular heterogeneity within the tumor and its surrounding environment, and tumors readily develop resistance to existing treatments. In addition, tumors in both species develop spontaneously in the context of an intact immune system. This study attempted to exploit the patient immune system using adjunct treatment along with surgery to develop patient-customized immune therapy for canine breast cancer that may have translational potential for human disease. [2](#B2) [6](#B6) [8](#B8) [32](#B32) [33](#B33) [36](#B36)]. A strategy and technology for high-speed cell sorting of primary canine DCs for construction of canine hybrid-DC fusion vaccines using these CMT cell lines were previously reported [ [3](#B3) [4](#B4)]. The resulting DC fusions were of high quality (fusion rates of 40%-70%) and vaccination induced significant enhancement of both cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity and serum immunity in normal healthy dogs with no observable general or immune-related adverse effects, even with repeated vaccination. [5](#B5) [25](#B25) [27](#B27) [28](#B28)]. The intent was to enhance the patients' immunity by therapeutic vaccination to manage residual disease, following a surgical resection, as well as potential recurrent disease by establishing functioning immune memory to tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). Because these vaccine constructs were based on the patient's own DCs, they have the potential for direct CMT cell antigen processing and presentation. The delivery of vaccine constructs directly into the draining popliteal lymph nodes was designed to promote and prime the local/regional immune responses enhanced by the CpG effect. [33](#B33)]. [25](#B25) [27](#B27) [28](#B28)]. Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analogue that to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and can replace the nucleoside, cytosine, promoting the arrest of proliferating cells in the S phase. Antitumor recognition can be enhanced by selectively depleting myeloid suppressor (Gr-1+/CD11b+) cells and can result in an enhancement of apoptosis or programed cell death [ [25](#B25)]. In humans, this treatment has fewer side effects compared to 5-FU (such as neutropenia), but this has not been confirmed in dogs. Moreover, it has been shown to be an effective anticancer chemotherapy on its own in the treatment of human non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, bladder cancer, and breast cancer [ [31](#B31) [35](#B35) [40](#B40)]. The role of gemcitabine in modifying the immune response by promoting the breaking of tolerance to TAA(s) has been characterized in terms of the lower Treg populations but may act to increase the activation of helper and cytotoxic T cells [ [25](#B25) [26](#B26) [27](#B27) [28](#B28)]. The relatively low number of animals investigated did not allow an independent investigation of the individual vaccine components. Because they were not investigated independently, it is possible that some or indeed all of the improvements in the patient outcome were due to either the vaccine or gemcitabine treatment or were due to a combination of both treatments. Similarly, it is also possible that CpG alone could elicit at least some of this improvement, but this is unlikely because such adjunct treatments have not been shown to improve specific immune reactions independently [ [37](#B37)]. Although the results of this preliminary investigation are quite promising, further investigation involving more cases will be needed to resolve the contributions of each component of the vaccine strategy. [6](#B6) [7](#B7)]. This included a lack of change in the remaining mammary glands of any of the treated animals on follow-up gross examinations. Unlike previous investigations on healthy laboratory dogs, no histological analysis was possible in these client-owned animals [ [3](#B3)]. [3](#B3) [4](#B4)], there were some concerns that there was a greater potential for the CMT cell component of the vaccine to be tumorigenic. Unfortunately, the biopsy specimens needed to evaluate this concern could not be taken as these were client-owned animals with spontaneous disease. On the other hand, given the much longer survival time of the vaccinated animals in the breast cancer vaccine group with no gross evidence of recurrence and their evident quality of life, it is unlikely that this was a problem because there were no long-term adverse effects observed and no evidence of tumor growth, particularly near the site of injection. [1](#B1)]. Vaccination had no apparent effect on the inflammatory carcinoma cases and in some cases, death preceded completion of the trial vaccine treatment protocol, making these cases clearly very different from the other treatment groups. In these cases, the inflammatory carcinoma subtype is likely to be responsible for the short survival time because such cases in dogs also include the triple negative mammary cancer disease phenotype. Death in these cases may have involved enhanced inflammatory cytokine levels [ [29](#B29) [33](#B33) [39](#B39) [40](#B40)]. [41](#B41)]. This approach to the treatment of canine breast cancers could also serve as an important intermediate model of human disease for the development of living immunomodulatory cancer treatments. "}
