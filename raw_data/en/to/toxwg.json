It was launchedby United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan in June 2001, and the princi-pal assessment reports will be released in 2005. The MA focuses on how changesin ecosystem services have affected human well-being, how ecosystem changesmay affect people in future decades, and what types of responses can be adopted atlocal, national, or global scales to improve ecosystem management and therebycontribute to human well-being and poverty alleviation. Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Convention to Com- bat Desertification, the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, and the Conventionon Migratory Species have asked the MA to provide scientific information toassist in the implementation of these treaties. The MA will also address the needsof other stakeholders, including the private sector, civil society, and indigenouspeoples organizations. The MA is closely coordinated with other internationalassessments that focus in greater depth on particular sectors or drivers of change,such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Global Interna-tional Waters Assessment. Scientific evaluations such as these help underpin vari-ous regular annual and biennial international reporting mechanisms, such as theGlobal Environmental Outlook , the World Resources Report , the Human Develop- ment Report , and the World Development Report . Leading scientists from more than 100 nations are conducting the MA under the direction of a Board that includes representatives of five international con-ventions, five United Nations agencies, international scientific organizations, andleaders from the private sector, nongovernmental organizations, and indigenousgroups. If the MA proves to be useful to its stakeholders, it is anticipated that anintegrated ecosystem assessment process modeled on this process will be repeatedat a global scale every 5-10 years and that ecosystem assessments will be regularlyconducted at national or sub-national scales. An ecosystem assessment can aid any country, region, or company by: \u0084deepening understanding of the relationship and linkages between ecosystems and human well-being; \u0084demonstrating the potential of ecosystems to contribute to poverty reductionand enhanced well-being; \u0084evaluating the compatibility of policies established by institutions at differentscales; x MA_CF-i-xiv.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:38 PM 10Preface xi \u0084integrating economic, environmental, social, and cultural aspirations; \u0084integrating information from both natural and social science; \u0084identifying and evaluating policy and management options for sustaining eco- system services and harmonizing them with human needs; and \u0084facilitating integrated ecosystem management. The MA will help both in choosing among existing options and in identifying new approaches to carrying out the Plan of Implementation adopted at the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) and achieving the United Na-tions Millennium Development Goals. The WSSD Plan reiterates those goalsand states that in order to \"reverse the current trend in natural resource degrada-tion as soon as possible, it is necessary to implement strategies which should in-clude targets adopted at the national and, where appropriate, regional levels toprotect ecosystems and to achieve integrated management of land, water and liv-ing resources, while strengthening regional, national and local capacities.\" The MA will contribute directly to this goal and can respond to the WSSD call to: improve policy and decision-making at all levels through, inter alia , improved collaboration between natural and social scientists, and between scientistsand policy makers, including through urgent actions at all levels to: (a) In-crease the use of scientific knowledge and technology, and increase the ben-eficial use of local and indigenous knowledge in a manner respectful of theholders of that knowledge and consistent with national law; (b) Make greateruse of integrated scientific assessments, risk assessments and interdisciplinaryand intersectoral approaches;... . The MA also seeks to help build individual and institutional capacity to un- dertake integrated ecosystem assessments and to act on their findings. In the finalanalysis, societies need to be enabled to manage their biological resources andtheir ecosystems better with the resources at hand. The human capacity to do sois vital. Wherever the MA activities unfold, they will leave a corps of more awareand motivated collaborators to continue the effort to achieve more enlightenedand effective management. This first report of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment describes the concep- tual framework that is being used in the MA. It is not a formal assessment of theliterature, but rather a scientifically informed presentation of the choices made bythe assessment team in structuring the analysis and framing the issues. The concep-tual framework elaborated in this report describes the approach and assumptionsthat will underlie the analysis conducted in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment.The framework was developed through interactions among the experts involved inthe MA as well as stakeholders who will use its findings. It represents one means ofexamining the linkages between ecosystems and human well-being that is bothscientifically credible and relevant to decision-makers. This framework for analysis MA_CF-i-xiv.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:38 PM 11xii Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment and decision-making should be of use to a wide array of individuals and institu- tions in government, the private sector, and civil society that seek to incorporateconsiderations of ecosystem services in their assessments, plans, and actions. Five overarching questions, along with the detailed lists of user needs provided by convention secretariats and the private sector, guide the issues being assessed: \u0084What are the current conditions and trends of ecosystems and their associated human well-being? \u0084What are the plausible future changes in ecosystems and in the supply of anddemand for ecosystem services and the consequent changes in health, liveli- hood, security, and other constituents of well-being? \u0084What can we do to enhance well-being and conserve ecosystems? What arethe strengths and weaknesses of response options, actions, and processes that can be considered to realize or avoid specific futures? \u0084What are the most robust findings and key uncertainties that affect the provi-sion of ecosystem services (including the consequent changes in health, liveli-hood, and security) and other management decisions and policy formulations? \u0084What tools and methodologies developed and used in the MA can strengthencapacity to assess ecosystems, the services they provide, their impacts on hu-man well-being, and the implications of response options? The MA was launched in June 2001, and the final global assessment reports will be released in 2005. In addition, a series of short synthesis reports will beprepared, targeted at the needs of specific audiences, including the internationalconventions and the private sector. Up to 15 sub-global assessments may be car-ried out at local, national, and regional scales using this same conceptual frame-work and designed to contribute to decision-making at those scales. These sub-global assessments have already begun to release initial findings and will continuethrough 2006. During the course of the assessments, an ongoing dialogue is underway with the users at global and sub-global scales in order to ensure that theassessments are responsive to the needs of the users and that the users are in-formed regarding the potential utility of the findings. This report has undergone two rounds of peer-review, first by experts involved in other parts of the MA process and then by both experts and governments(through the national focal points of the Convention on Biological Diversity,Convention to Combat Desertification, and the Ramsar Convention on Wet-lands and through participating National Academies of Science).

MA_CF-i-xiv.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:38 PM 14Summary Human well-being and progress toward sustainable development are vitally dependent upon improving the management of Earth's ecosystems to ensure their conservation andsustainable use. But while demands for ecosystem services such as food and clean waterare growing, human actions are at the same time diminishing the capability of many eco-systems to meet these demands. Sound policy and management interventions can oftenreverse ecosystem degradation and enhance the contributions of ecosystems to humanwell-being, but knowing when and how to intervene requires substantial understandingof both the ecological and the social systems involved. Better information cannot guaran-tee improved decisions, but it is a prerequisite for sound decision-making. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) will help provide the knowledge base for im- proved decisions and will build capacity for analyzing and supplying this information. Thisdocument presents the conceptual and methodological approach that the MA will use toassess options that can enhance the contribution of ecosystems to human well-being. Thissame approach should provide a suitable basis for governments, the private sector, andcivil society to factor considerations of ecosystems and ecosystem services into their ownplanning and actions. Humanity has always depended on the services provided by the biosphere and its ecosystems. Further, the biosphere is itself the product of life on Earth. The composition of the atmosphere and soil, the cycling of ele- ments through air and waterways, and many other ecological assets are allthe result of living processes\u2014and all are maintained and replenished by living ecosystems. The human species, while buffered against environmen- tal immediacies by culture and technology, is ultimately fully dependenton the flow of ecosystem services. In his April 2000 Millennium Report to the United Nations General Assembly, in recognition of the growing burden that degraded ecosystemsare placing on human well-being and economic development and the op- portunity that better managed ecosystems provide for meeting the goals of poverty eradication and sustainable development, United Nations Secre-tary-General Kofi Annan stated that: It is impossible to devise effective environmental policy unless it is based on sound scientific information. While major advances in data collection have been madein many areas, large gaps in our knowledge remain. In particular, there has neverbeen a comprehensive global assessment of the world's major ecosystems. Theplanned Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, a major interna tional collaborative effort to map the health of our planet, is a response to this need. 1 MA_CF-01-25.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:42 PM 12 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment was established with the in- volvement of governments, the private sector, nongovernmental organi- zations, and scientists to provide an integrated assessment of the conse- quences of ecosystem change for human well-being and to analyze optionsavailable to enhance the conservation of ecosystems and their contribu- tions to meeting human needs. The Convention on Biological Diversity, the Convention to Combat Desertification, the Convention on Migra-tory Species, and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands plan to use the findings of the MA, which will also help meet the needs of others in gov- ernment, the private sector, and civil society. The MA should help toachieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goals and to carry out the Plan of Implementation of the 2002 World Summit on Sustain- able Development. It will mobilize hundreds of scientists from countriesaround the world to provide information and clarify science concerning issues of greatest relevance to decision-makers. The MA will identify ar- eas of broad scientific agreement and also point to areas of continuingscientific debate. The assessment framework developed for the MA offers decision- makers a mechanism to: \u0084Identify options that can better achieve core human development and sustainability goals. All countries and communities are grappling with the challenge of meeting growing demands for food, clean water,health, and employment. And decision-makers in the private and pub- lic sectors must also balance economic growth and social development with the need for environmental conservation. All of these concernsare linked directly or indirectly to the world's ecosystems. The MA pro-cess, at all scales, will bring the best science to bear on the needs ofdecision-makers concerning these links between ecosystems, humandevelopment, and sustainability. \u0084Better understand the trade-offs involved\u2014across sectors and stake-holders\u2014in decisions concerning the environment. Ecosystem-related problems have historically been approached issue by issue, but rarelyby pursuing multisectoral objectives. This approach has not withstood the test of time. Progress toward one objective such as increasing food production has often been at the cost of progress toward other objec-tives such as conserving biological diversity or improving water qual-ity. The MA framework complements sectoral assessments with infor-mation on the full impact of potential policy choices across sectorsand stakeholders. MA_CF-01-25.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:43 PM 2Summary 3 \u0084Align response options with the level of governance where they can be most effective. Effective management of ecosystems will require actions at all scales, from the local to the global. Human actions nowdirectly or inadvertently affect virtually all of the world's ecosystems;actions required for the management of ecosystems refer to the stepsthat humans can take to modify their direct or indirect influences on ecosystems. The management and policy options available and the con- cerns of stakeholders differ greatly across these scales. The priority ar-eas for biodiversity conservation in a country as defined based on \"glo-bal\" value, for example, would be very different from those as definedbased on the value to local communities. The multiscale assessmentframework developed for the MA provides a new approach for analyz- ing policy options at all scales\u2014from local communities to interna- tional conventions. What Is the Problem? Ecosystem services are the benefits people obtain from ecosystems, which the MA describes as provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural ser- vices. (See Box 1.) Ecosystem services include products such as food, fuel,and fiber; regulating services such as climate regulation and disease con- trol; and nonmaterial benefits such as spiritual or aesthetic benefits. BOX 1. Key Definitions Ecosystem. An ecosystem is a dynamic complex of plant, animal, and microorgan- ism communities and the nonliving environment interacting as a functional unit. Humans are an integral part of ecosystems. Ecosystems vary enormously in size; atemporary pond in a tree hollow and an ocean basin can both be ecosystems. Ecosystem services. Ecosystem services are the benefits people obtain from ecosys- tems. These include provisioning services such as food and water; regulating ser-vices such as regulation of floods, drought, land degradation, and disease; support- ing services such as soil formation and nutrient cycling; and cultural services such as recreational, spiritual, religious and other nonmaterial benefits. Well-being. Human well-being has multiple constituents, including basic material for a good life, freedom and choice, health, good social relations, and security. Well- being is at the opposite end of a continuum from poverty, which has been defined asa \"pronounced deprivation in well-being.\" The constituents of well-being, as expe- rienced and perceived by people, are situation-dependent, reflecting local geogra- phy, culture, and ecological circumstances. MA_CF-01-25.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:43 PM 34 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment Changes in these services affect human well-being in many ways. (See Figure 1.) The demand for ecosystem services is now so great that trade-offs among services have become the rule. A country can increase food supply by con-verting a forest to agriculture, for example, but in so doing it decreases the supply of services that may be of equal or greater importance, such as clean water, timber, ecotourism destinations, or flood regulation and droughtcontrol. There are many indications that human demands on ecosystems will grow still greater in the coming decades. Current estimates of 3 bil- lion more people and a quadrupling of the world economy by 2050 implya formidable increase in demand for and consumption of biological and physical resources, as well as escalating impacts on ecosystems and the services they provide. The problem posed by the growing demand for ecosystem services is compounded by increasingly serious degradation in the capability of eco- systems to provide these services. World fisheries are now declining due tooverfishing, for instance, and some 40 percent of agricultural land has been degraded in the past half-century by erosion, salinization, compac- tion, nutrient depletion, pollution, and urbanization. Other human-induced on ecosystems include alteration of the nitrogen, phos- phorous, sulfur, and carbon cycles, causing acid rain, algal blooms, and fish kills in rivers and coastal waters, along with contributions to climatechange. In many parts of the world, this degradation of ecosystem services is exacerbated by the associated loss of the knowledge and understanding held by local communities\u2014knowledge that sometimes could help to en-sure the sustainable use of the ecosystem. This combination of ever-growing demands being placed on increas- ingly degraded ecosystems seriously diminishes the prospects for sustain-able development. Human well-being is affected not just by gaps between ecosystem service supply and demand but also by the increased vulner- ability of individuals, communities, and nations. Productive ecosystems,with their array of services, provide people and communities with resources and options they can use as insurance in the face of natural catastrophes or social upheaval. While well-managed ecosystems reduce risks and vulner-ability, poorly managed systems can exacerbate them by increasing risks of flood, drought, crop failure, or disease. Ecosystem degradation tends to harm rural populations more directly than urban populations and has its most direct and severe impact on poor people. The wealthy control access to a greater share of ecosystem ser- vices, consume those services at a higher per capita rate, and are buffered MA_CF-01-25.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:43 PM 4Summary 5 FIGURE 1. Ecosystem Services and Their Links to Human Well-being Ecosystem services are the benefits people obtain from ecosystems. These include provi- sioning, regulating, and cultural services, which directly affect people, and supporting services needed to maintain the other services. Changes in these services affect human well-being through impacts on security, the basic material for a good life, health, and socialand cultural relations. These constituents of well-being are, in turn, influenced by and have an influence on the freedoms and choices available to people. MA_CF-01-25.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:43 PM 56 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment from changes in their availability (often at a substantial cost) through their ability to purchase scarce ecosystem services or substitutes. For ex- ample, even though a number of marine fisheries have been depleted in the past century, the supply of fish to wealthy consumers has not beendisrupted since fishing fleets have been able to shift to previously underexploited stocks. In contrast, poor people often lack access to alter- nate services and are highly vulnerable to ecosystem changes that result infamine, drought, or floods. They frequently live in locations particularly sensitive to environmental threats, and they lack financial and institu- tional buffers against these dangers. Degradation of coastal fishery resources,for instance, results in a decline in protein consumed by the local commu- nity since fishers may not have access to alternate sources of fish and com- munity members may not have enough income to purchase fish. Degrada-tion affects their very survival. Changes in ecosystems affect not just humans but countless other spe- cies as well. The management objectives that people set for ecosystemsand the actions that they take are influenced not just by the consequences of ecosystem changes for humans but also by the importance people place on considerations of the intrinsic value of species and ecosystems. Intrin-sic value is the value of something in and for itself, irrespective of its util- ity for someone else. For example, villages in India protect \"spirit sanctu- aries\" in relatively natural states, even though a strict cost-benefitcalculation might favor their conversion to agriculture. Similarly, many countries have passed laws protecting endangered species based on the view that these species have a right to exist, even if their protection re-sults in net economic costs. Sound ecosystem management thus involves steps to address the utilitarian links of people to ecosystems as well as processes that allow considerations of the intrinsic value of ecosystems tobe factored into decision-making. The degradation of ecosystem services has many causes, including ex- cessive demand for ecosystem services stemming from economic growth,demographic changes, and individual choices. Market mechanisms do not always ensure the conservation of ecosystem services either because mar- kets do not exist for services such as cultural or regulatory services or,where they do exist, because policies and institutions do not enable people living within the ecosystem to benefit from services it may provide to others who are far away. For example, institutions are now only beginningto be developed to enable those benefiting from carbon sequestration to provide local managers with an economic incentive to leave a forest un- cut, while strong economic incentives often exist for managers to harvest MA_CF-01-25.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:43 PM 6Summary 7 the forest. Also, even if a market exists for an ecosystem service, the results obtained through the market may be socially or ecologically unde- sirable. Properly managed, the creation of ecotourism opportunities in a country can create strong economic incentives for the maintenance of thecultural services provided by ecosystems, but poorly managed ecotourism activities can degrade the very resource on which they depend. Finally, markets are often unable to address important intra- and intergenerationalequity issues associated with managing ecosystems for this and future gen- erations, given that some changes in ecosystem services are irreversible. The world has witnessed in recent decades not just dramatic changes to ecosystems but equally profound changes to social systems that shape both the pressures on ecosystems and the opportunities to respond. The relative influence of individual nation-states has diminished with thegrowth of power and influence of a far more complex array of institutions, including regional governments, multinational companies, the United Nations, and civil society organizations. Stakeholders have become moreinvolved in decision-making. Given the multiple actors whose decisions now strongly influence ecosystems, the challenge of providing informa- tion to decision-makers has grown. At the same time, the new institu-tional landscape may provide an unprecedented opportunity for informa- tion concerning ecosystems to make a major difference. Improvements in ecosystem management to enhance human well-being will require newinstitutional and policy arrangements and changes in rights and access to resources that may be more possible today under these conditions of rapid social change than they have ever been before. Like the benefits of increased education or improved governance, the protection, restoration, and enhancement of ecosystem services tends to have multiple and synergistic benefits. Already, many governments arebeginning to recognize the need for more effective management of these basic life-support systems. Examples of significant progress toward sustain- able management of biological resources can also be found in civil society,in indigenous and local communities, and in the private sector. Conceptual Framework The conceptual framework for the MA places human well-being as thecentral focus for assessment, while recognizing that biodiversity and eco- systems also have intrinsic value and that people take decisions concern- ing ecosystems based on considerations of well-being as well as intrinsicvalue. (See Box 2.) The MA conceptual framework assumes that a dy- MA_CF-01-25.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:43 PM 78 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment namic interaction exists between people and ecosystems, with the chang- ing human condition serving to both directly and indirectly drive change in ecosystems and with changes in ecosystems causing changes in human well-being. At the same time, many other factors independent of the en-vironment change the human condition, and many natural forces are in- fluencing ecosystems. The MA focuses particular attention on the linkages between ecosys- tem services and human well-being. The assessment deals with the full range of ecosystems\u2014from those relatively undisturbed, such as natural forests, to landscapes with mixed patterns of human use and ecosystemsintensively managed and modified by humans, such as agricultural land and urban areas. A full assessment of the interactions between people and ecosystems requires a multiscale approach because it better reflects the multiscale na- ture of decision-making, allows the examination of driving forces that may be exogenous to particular regions, and provides a means of examining thedifferential impact of ecosystem changes and policy responses on different regions and groups within regions. This section explains in greater detail the characteristics of each of the components of the MA conceptual framework, moving clockwise from the lower left corner of the figure in Box 2. Ecosystems and Their Services An ecosystem is a dynamic complex of plant, animal, and microorganism communities and the nonliving environment interacting as a functional unit. Humans are an integral part of ecosystems. Ecosystems provide a variety of benefits to people, including provisioning, regulating, cultural,and supporting services. Provisioning services are the products people ob- tain from ecosystems, such as food, fuel, fiber, fresh water, and genetic resources. Regulating services are the benefits people obtain from the regu-lation of ecosystem processes, including air quality maintenance, climate regulation, erosion control, regulation of human diseases, and water puri- fication. Cultural services are the nonmaterial benefits people obtain fromecosystems through spiritual enrichment, cognitive development, reflec- tion, recreation, and aesthetic experiences. Supporting services are those that are necessary for the production of all other ecosystem services, suchas primary production, production of oxygen, and soil formation. Biodiversity and ecosystems are closely related concepts. Biodiversity is the variability among living organisms from all sources, including ter-restrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological com- MA_CF-01-25.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:43 PM 8Summary 9 BOX 2. Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Conceptual Framework Changes in factors that indirectly affect ecosystems, such as population, technol- ogy, and lifestyle (upper right corner of figure), can lead to changes in factors di- rectly affecting ecosystems, such as the catch of fisheries or the application of fertil- izers to increase food production (lower right corner). The resulting changes in theecosystem (lower left corner) cause the ecosystem services to change and thereby affect human well-being. These interactions can take place at more than one scale and can cross scales. For example, a global market may lead to regional loss of forestcover, which increases flood magnitude along a local stretch of a river. Similarly, the interactions can take place across different time scales. Actions can be taken either to respond to negative changes or to enhance positive changes at almost all pointsin this framework (black cross bars). plexes of which they are part. It includes diversity within and between species and diversity of ecosystems. Diversity is a structural feature of eco- systems, and the variability among ecosystems is an element of biodiversity. Products of biodiversity include many of the services produced by ecosys- MA_CF-01-25.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:43 PM 910 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment tems (such as food and genetic resources), and changes in biodiversity can influence all the other services they provide. In addition to the important role of biodiversity in providing ecosystem services, the diversity of livingspecies has intrinsic value independent of any human concern. The concept of an ecosystem provides a valuable framework for analyz- ing and acting on the linkages between people and the environment. Forthat reason, the \"ecosystem approach\" has been endorsed by the Conven- tion on Biological Diversity (CBD), and the MA conceptual framework is entirely consistent with this approach. The CBD states that the ecosys-BOX 3. Reporting Categories Used in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment The MA will use 10 categories of systems to report its global findings. (See table.) These categories are not ecosystems themselves; each contains a number of ecosys- tems. The MA reporting categories are not mutually exclusive: their boundaries can and do overlap. Ecosystems within each category share a suite of biological, cli-matic, and social factors that tend to differ across categories. Because the bound- aries of these reporting categories overlap, any place on Earth may fall into more than one category. Thus, for example, a wetland ecosystem in a coastal region maybe examined both in the MA analysis of \"coastal systems\" as well as in its analysis of \"inland water systems.\" Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Reporting Categories Category Central Concept Boundary Limits for Mapping Marine Ocean, with fishing typically a major driver of change Marine areas where the sea is deeper than 50 meters. Coastal Interface between ocean and land, extending seawards to about the middle of the continental shelf and inland to include all areas strongly influenced by the proximity to the ocean Area between 50 meters below mean sea level and 50 meters above the high tide level or extending landward to a distance 100 kilometers from shore. Includes coral reefs, intertidal zones, estuaries, coastal aquaculture, and seagrass communities. Inland water Permanent water bodies inland from the coastal zone, and areas whose ecology and use are dominated by the permanent, seasonal, or intermittent occurrence of flooded conditions Rivers, lakes, floodplains, reservoirs, and wetlands; includes inland saline system s. Note that the Ramsar Convention considers \"wetlands\" to include both inland water and coastal categories. Forest Lands dominated by trees; often used for timber, fuelwood, and non-timber forest products A canopy cover of at least 40 percent by woody plants taller than 5 meters. The existence of many other definitions is acknowledged, and other limits (such as crown cover greater than 10 percent, as used by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) will also be reported.

This approach recognizes that humans, with their culturaldiversity, are an integral component of many ecosystems. In order to implement the ecosystem approach, decision-makers need to understand the multiple effects on an ecosystem of any management orpolicy change. By way of analogy, decision-makers would not take a deci- sion about financial policy in a country without examining the condition of the economic system, since information on the economy of a singleBOX 3. continued Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Reporting Categories Category Central Concept Boundary Limits for Mapping Dryland Lands where plant production is limited by water availability; the dominant uses are large mammal herbivory, including livestock grazing, and cultivation Drylands as defined by the Convention to Combat Desertification, namely lands where annual precipitation is less than two thirds of potential evaporation, from dry subhumid areas (ratio ranges 0.50-0.65), through semiarid, arid, and hyper-arid (ratio <0.05), include cultivated lands, scrublands, shrublands, grasslands, semi-deserts, and true deserts.

MA_CF-01-25.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:43 PM 1112 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment sector such as manufacturing would be insufficient. The same need to examine the consequences of changes for multiple sectors applies to ecosystems. For instance, subsidies for fertilizer use may increase food pro- duction, but sound decisions also require information on whether thepotential reduction in the harvests of downstream fisheries as a result of water quality degradation from the fertilizer runoff might outweigh those benefits. For the purpose of analysis and assessment, a pragmatic view of ecosys- tem boundaries must be adopted, depending on the questions being asked. A well-defined ecosystem has strong interactions among its componentsand weak interactions across its boundaries. A useful choice of ecosystem boundary is one where a number of discontinuities coincide, such as in the distribution of organisms, soil types, drainage basins, and depth in awaterbody. At a larger scale, regional and even globally distributed ecosys- tems can be evaluated based on a commonality of basic structural units. The global assessment being undertaken by the MA will report on marine,coastal, inland water, forest, dryland, island, mountain, polar, cultivated, and urban regions. These regions are not ecosystems themselves, but each contains a number of ecosystems (See Box 3.) People seek multiple services from ecosystems and thus perceive the condition of given ecosystems in relation to their ability to provide the services desired. Various methods can be used to assess the ability of eco-systems to deliver particular services. With those answers in hand, stake- holders have the information they need to decide on a mix of services best meeting their needs. The MA will consider criteria and methods to pro-vide an integrated view of the condition of ecosystems. The condition of each category of ecosystem services is evaluated in somewhat different ways, although in general a full assessment of any service requires consid-erations of stocks, flows, and resilience of the service. Human Well-being and Poverty Reduction Human well-being has multiple constituents, including the basic material for a good life, freedom and choice, health, good social relations, andsecurity. Poverty is also multidimensional and has been defined as the pro- nounced deprivation of well-being. How well-being, ill-being, or poverty are experienced and expressed depends on context and situation, reflect-ing local physical, social, and personal factors such as geography, environ- ment, age, gender, and culture. In all contexts, however, ecosystems are essential for human well-being through their provisioning, regulating,cultural, and supporting services. MA_CF-01-25.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:43 PM 12Summary 13 Human intervention in ecosystems can amplify the benefits to human society. However, evidence in recent decades of escalating human impacts on ecological systems worldwide raises concerns about the spatial and tem- poral consequences of ecosystem changes detrimental to human well-being. Ecosystem changes affect human well-being in the following ways: \u0084Security is affected both by changes in provisioning services, which affect supplies of food and other goods and the likelihood of conflict over declining resources, and by changes in regulating services, which could influence the frequency and magnitude of floods, droughts, land-slides, or other catastrophes. It can also be affected by changes in cul-tural services as, for example, when the loss of important ceremonial orspiritual attributes of ecosystems contributes to the weakening of socialrelations in a community. These changes in turn affect material well- being, health, freedom and choice, security, and good social relations. \u0084Access to basic material for a good life is strongly linked to both pro- visioning services such as food and fiber production and regulating ser-vices, including water purification. \u0084Health is strongly linked to both provisioning services such as food production and regulating services, including those that influence thedistribution of disease-transmitting insects and of irritants and patho-gens in water and air. Health can also be linked to cultural services through recreational and spiritual benefits. \u0084Social relations are affected by changes to cultural services, which af- fect the quality of human experience. \u0084Freedoms and choice are largely predicated on the existence of the other components of well-being and are thus influenced by changes inprovisioning, regulating, or cultural services from ecosystems. Human well-being can be enhanced through sustainable human inter- actions with ecosystems supported by necessary instruments, institutions,organizations, and technology. Creation of these through participation and transparency may contribute to freedoms and choice as well as to increased economic, social, and ecological security. By ecological security, we meanthe minimum level of ecological stock needed to ensure a sustainable flow of ecosystem services. Yet the benefits conferred by institutions and technology are neither automatic nor equally shared. In particular, such opportunities are more readily grasped by richer than poorer countries and people; some institu- tions and technologies mask or 7/11/2003, 12:43 PM 1314 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment sponsible governance, while essential, is not easily achieved; participation in decision-making, an essential element of responsible governance, is expensive in time and resources to maintain. Unequal access to ecosystem services has often elevated the well-being of small segments of the popula-tion at the expense of others. Sometimes the consequences of the depletion and degradation of eco- system services can be mitigated by the substitution of knowledge and ofmanufactured or human capital. For example, the addition of fertilizer in agricultural systems has been able to offset declining soil fertility in many regions of the world where people have sufficient economic resources topurchase these inputs, and water treatment facilities can sometimes sub- stitute for the role of watersheds and wetlands in water purification. But ecosystems are complex and dynamic systems and there are limits to sub-stitution possibilities, especially with regulating, cultural, and supporting services. No substitution is possible for the extinction of culturally impor- tant species such as tigers or whales, for instance, and substitutions may beeconomically impractical for the loss of services such as erosion control or climate regulation. Moreover, the scope for substitutions varies by social, economic, and cultural conditions. For some people, especially the poor-est, substitutes and choices are very limited. For those who are better off, substitution may be possible through trade, investment, and technology. Because of the inertia in both ecological and human systems, the con- sequences of ecosystem changes made today may not be felt for decades. Thus, sustaining ecosystem services, and thereby human well-being, re- quires a full understanding and wise management of the relationships be-tween human activities, ecosystem change, and well-being over the short, medium, and long term. Excessive current use of ecosystem services com- promises their future availability. This can be prevented by ensuring thatthe use is sustainable. Achieving sustainable use requires effective and efficient institutions that can provide the mechanisms through which concepts of freedom,justice, fairness, basic capabilities, and equity govern the access to and use of ecosystem services. Such institutions may also need to mediate con- flicts between individual and social interests that arise. The best way to manage ecosystems to enhance human well-being will differ if the focus is on meeting needs of the poor and weak or the rich and powerful. For both groups, ensuring the long-term supply of ecosystemservices is essential. But for the poor, an equally critical need is to provide more equitable and secure access to ecosystem services. MA_CF-01-25.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:43 PM 14Summary 15 Drivers of Change Understanding the factors that cause changes in ecosystems and ecosys- tem services is essential to designing interventions that capture positive impacts and minimize negative ones. In the MA, a \"driver\" is any factor that changes an aspect of an ecosystem. A direct driver unequivocallyinfluences ecosystem processes and can therefore be identified and mea- sured to differing degrees of accuracy. An indirect driver operates more diffusely, often by altering one or more direct drivers, and its influence isestablished by understanding its effect on a direct driver. Both indirect and direct drivers often operate synergistically. Changes in land cover, for example, can increase the likelihood of introduction of alien invasive spe-cies. Similarly, technological advances can increase rates of economic growth. The MA explicitly recognizes the role of decision-makers who affect ecosystems, ecosystem services, and human well-being. Decisions are made at three organizational levels, although the distinction between those lev- els is often diffuse and difficult to define: \u0084by individuals and small groups at the local level (such as a field or forest stand) who directly alter some part of the ecosystem; \u0084by public and private decision-makers at the municipal, provincial, andnational levels; and \u0084by public and private decision-makers at the international level, suchas through international conventions and multilateral agreements. The decision-making process is complex and multidimensional. We refer to a driver that can be influenced by a decision-maker as an endog- enous driver and one over which the decision-maker does not have con- trol as an exogenous driver. The amount of fertilizer applied on a farm isan endogenous driver from the standpoint of the farmer, for example, while the price of the fertilizer is an exogenous driver, since the farmer's deci- sions have little direct influence on price. The specific temporal, spatial,and organizational scale dependencies of endogenous and exogenous driv- ers and the specific linkages and interactions among drivers will be explic- itly assessed in the MA. Whether a driver is exogenous or endogenous to a decision-maker is dependent upon the spatial and temporal scale. For example, a local deci- sion-maker can directly influence the choice of technology, changes in landuse, and external inputs (such as fertilizers or irrigation), but has little con- trol over prices and markets, property rights, technology development, or MA_CF-01-25.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:43 PM 1516 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment the local climate. In contrast, a national or regional decision-maker has more control over many factors, such as macroeconomic policy, technology development, property rights, trade barriers, prices, and markets. But on the short time scale, that individual has little control over the climate or globalpopulation. On the longer time scale, drivers that are exogenous to a deci- sion-maker in the short run, such as population, become endogenous since the decision-maker can influence them through, for instance, education,the advancement of women, and migration policies. The indirect drivers of change are primarily: \u0084demographic (such as population size, age and gender structure, and spatial distribution); \u0084economic (such as national and per capita income, macroeconomicpolicies, international trade, and capital flows); \u0084sociopolitical (such as democratization, the roles of women, of civilsociety, and of the private sector, and international dispute mechanisms); \u0084scientific and technological (such as rates of investments in researchand development and the rates of adoption of new technologies, in-cluding biotechnologies and information technologies); and \u0084cultural and religious (such as choices individuals make about what and how much to consume and what they value). The interaction of several of these drivers, in turn, affects levels of resource consumption and differences in consumption both within and between countries. Clearly these drivers are changing\u2014population andthe world economy are growing, for instance, there are major advances in information technology and biotechnology, and the world is becoming more interconnected. Changes in these drivers are projected to increasethe demand for and consumption of food, fiber, clean water, and energy, which will in turn affect the direct drivers. The direct drivers are primarily physical, chemical, and biological\u2014such as land cover change, climatechange, air and water pollution, irrigation, use of fertilizers, harvesting, and the introduction of alien invasive species. Change is apparent here too: the climate is changing, species ranges are shifting, alien species arespreading, and land degradation continues. An important point is that any decision can have consequences exter- nal to the decision framework. These consequences are called externali-ties because they are not part of the decision-making calculus. Externalities can have positive or negative effects. For example, a decision to subsidize fertilizers to increase crop production might result in substantial degrada- MA_CF-01-25.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:43 PM 16Summary 17 tion of water quality from the added nutrients and degradation of down- stream fisheries. But it is also possible to have positive externalities. A beekeeper might be motivated by the profits to be made from selling honey, for instance, but neighboring orchards could produce more apples becauseof enhanced pollination arising from the presence of the bees. Multiple interacting drivers cause changes in ecosystem services. There are functional interdependencies between and among the indirect anddirect drivers of change, and, in turn, changes in ecological services lead to feedbacks on the drivers of changes in ecological services. Synergetic driver combinations are common. The many processes of globalizationlead to new forms of interactions between drivers of changes in ecosystem services. Cross-scale Interactions and Assessment An effective assessment of ecosystems and human well-being cannot be conducted at a single temporal or spatial scale. Thus the MA conceptual framework includes both of these dimensions. Ecosystem changes that may have little impact on human well-being over days or weeks (soil erosion,for instance) may have pronounced impacts over years or decades (declin- ing agricultural productivity). Similarly, changes at a local scale may have little impact on some services at that scale (as in the local impact of forestloss on water availability) but major impacts at large scales (forest loss in a river basin changing the timing and magnitude of downstream flooding). Ecosystem processes and services are typically most strongly expressed, are most easily observed, or have their dominant controls or consequences at particular spatial and temporal scales. They often exhibit a characteris- tic scale\u2014the typical extent or duration over which processes have theirimpact. Spatial and temporal scales are often closely related. For instance, food production is a localized service of an ecosystem and changes on a weekly basis, water regulation is regional and changes on a monthly orseasonal basis, and climate regulation may take place at a global scale over decades. Assessments need to be conducted at spatial and temporal scales ap- propriate to the process or phenomenon being examined. Those done over large areas generally use data at coarse resolutions, which may not detect fine-resolution processes. Even if data are collected at a fine level of de-tail, the process of averaging in order to present findings at the larger scale causes local patterns or anomalies to disappear. This is particularly prob- lematic for processes exhibiting thresholds and nonlinearities. For example,even though a number of fish stocks exploited in a particular area might MA_CF-01-25.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:43 PM 1718 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment have collapsed due to overfishing, average catches across all stocks (including healthier stocks) would not reveal the extent of the problem. Assessors, if they are aware of such thresholds and have access to high- resolution data, can incorporate such information even in a large-scaleassessment. Yet an assessment done at smaller spatial scales can help iden- tify important dynamics of the system that might otherwise be overlooked. Likewise, phenomena and processes that occur at much larger scales, al-though expressed locally, may go unnoticed in purely local-scale assess- ments. Increased carbon dioxide concentrations or decreased stratospheric ozone concentrations have local effects, for instance, but it would bedifficult to trace the causality of the effects without an examination of the overall global process. Time scale is also very important in conducting assessments. Humans tend not to think beyond one or two generations. If an assessment covers a shorter time period than the characteristic temporal scale, it may not adequately capture variability associated with long-term cycles, such asglaciation. Slow changes are often harder to measure, as is the case with the impact of climate change on the geographic distribution of species or populations. Moreover, both ecological and human systems have substan-tial inertia, and the impact of changes occurring today may not be seen for years or decades. For example, some fisheries catches may increase for sev- eral years even after they have reached unsustainable levels because of thelarge number of juvenile fish produced before that level was reached. Social, political, and economic processes also have characteristic scales, which may vary widely in duration and extent. Those of ecological andsociopolitical processes often do not match. Many environmental prob- lems originate from this mismatch between the scale at which the ecologi- cal process occurs, the scale at which decisions are made, and the scale ofinstitutions for decision-making. A purely local-scale assessment, for in- stance, may discover that the most effective societal response requires ac- tion that can occur only at a national scale (such as the removal of asubsidy or the establishment of a regulation). Moreover, it may lack the relevance and credibility necessary to stimulate and inform national or regional changes. On the other hand, a purely global assessment may lackboth the relevance and the credibility necessary to lead to changes in eco- system management at the local scale where action is needed. Outcomes at a given scale are often heavily influenced by interactions of ecological,socioeconomic, and political factors emanating from other scales. Thus focusing solely on a single scale is likely to miss interactions with other MA_CF-01-25.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:43 PM 18Summary 19 scales that are critically important in understanding ecosystem determi- nants and their implications for human well-being. The choice of the spatial or temporal scale for an assessment is politi- cally laden, since it may intentionally or unintentionally privilege certaingroups. The selection of assessment scale with its associated level of detail implicitly favors particular systems of knowledge, types of information, and modes of expression over others. For example, non-codified informa-tion or knowledge systems of minority populations are often missed when assessments are undertaken at larger spatial scales or higher levels of ag- gregation. Reflecting on the political consequences of scale and boundarychoices is an important prerequisite to exploring what multi- and cross- scale analysis in the MA might contribute to decision-making and public policy processes at various scales. Values Associated with Ecosystems Current decision-making processes often ignore or underestimate thevalue of ecosystem services. Decision-making concerning ecosystems andtheir services can be particularly challenging because different disciplines, philosophical views, and schools of thought assess the value of ecosys- tems differently. One paradigm of value, known as the utilitarian (an-thropocentric) concept, is based on the principle of humans' preference satisfaction (welfare). In this case, ecosystems and the services they pro- vide have value to human societies because people derive utility fromtheir use, either directly or indirectly (use values). Within this utilitar- ian concept of value, people also give value to ecosystem services that they are not currently using (non-use values). Non-use values, usuallyknown as existence value, involve the case where humans ascribe value to knowing that a resource exists even if they never use that resource directly. These often involve the deeply held historical, national, ethi-cal, religious, and spiritual values people ascribe to ecosystems\u2014the val- ues that the MA recognizes as cultural services of ecosystems. A different, non-utilitarian value paradigm holds that something can have intrinsic value\u2014that is, it can be of value in and for itself\u2014 irrespective of its utility for someone else. From the perspective of many ethical, religious, and cultural points of view, ecosystems may have intrin-sic value, independent of their contribution to human well-being. The utilitarian and non-utilitarian value paradigms overlap and inter- act in many ways, but they use different metrics, with no common de- MA_CF-01-25.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:43 PM 1920 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: Framework for Assessment nominator, and cannot usually be aggregated, although both paradigms of value are used in decision-making processes. Under the utilitarian approach, a wide range of methodologies has been developed to attempt to quantify the benefits of different ecosystem ser-vices. These methods are particularly well developed for provisioning ser- vices, but recent work has also improved the ability to value regulating and other services. The choice of valuation technique in any given in-stance is dictated by the characteristics of the case and by data availabil- ity. (See Box 4.) Non-utilitarian value proceeds from a variety of ethical, cultural, reli- gious, and philosophical bases. These differ in the specific entities that are deemed to have intrinsic value and in the interpretation of what having intrinsic value means. Intrinsic value may complement or counterbalanceconsiderations of utilitarian value. For example, if the aggregate utility of the services provided by an ecosystem (as measured by its utilitarian value) outweighs the value of converting it to another use, its intrinsic value maythen be complementary and provide an additional impetus for conserving the ecosystem. If, however, economic valuation indicates that the value of converting the ecosystem outweighs the aggregate value of its services, itsascribed intrinsic value may be deemed great enough to warrant a social decision to conserve it anyway. Such decisions are essentially political, not economic. In contemporary democracies these decisions are made byparliaments or legislatures or by regulatory agencies mandated to do so by law. The sanctions for violating laws recognizing an entity's intrinsic value may be regarded as a measure of the degree of intrinsic value ascribed tothem. The decisions taken by businesses, local communities, and indi- viduals also can involve considerations of both utilitarian and non- utilitarian values. The mere act of quantifying the value of ecosystem services cannot by itself change the incentives affecting their use or misuse. Several changes in current practice may be required to take better account of these values.The MA will assess the use of information on ecosystem service values in decision-making. The goal is to improve decision-making processes and tools and to provide feedback regarding the kinds of information that canhave the most influence. Assessment Tools The information base exists in any country to undertake an assessmentwithin the framework of the MA. That said, although new data sets (for MA_CF-01-25.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:43 PM 20Summary 21 example, from remote sensing) providing globally consistent information make a global assessment like the MA more rigorous, there are still many challenges that must be dealt with in using these data at global or localscales. Among these challenges are biases in the geographic and temporal coverage of the data and in the types of data collected. Data availability for industrial countries is greater than that for developing ones, and datafor certain resources such as crop production are more readily available than data for fisheries, fuelwood, or biodiversity. The MA makes exten- sive use of both biophysical and socioeconomic indicators, which com-bine data into policy-relevant measures that provide the basis for assess- ment and decision-making. Models can be used to illuminate interactions among systems and driv- ers, as well as to make up for data deficiencies\u2014for instance, by providing estimates where observations are lacking. The MA will make use of envi- ronmental system models that can be used, for example, to measure theBOX 4. Valuation of Ecosystem Services Valuation can be used in many ways: to assess the total contribution that ecosys- tems make to human well-being, to understand the incentives that individual deci- sion-makers face in managing ecosystems in different ways, and to evaluate the consequences of alternative courses of action. The MA plans to use valuation pri-marily in the latter sense: as a tool that enhances the ability of decision-makers to evaluate trade-offs between alternative ecosystem management regimes and courses of social actions that alter the use of ecosystems and the multiple services theyprovide. This usually requires assessing the change in the mix (the value) of services provided by an ecosystem resulting from a given change in its management. Most of the work involved in estimating the change in the value of the flow of benefits provided by an ecosystem involves estimating the change in the physical flow of benefits (quantifying biophysical relations) and tracing through and quanti- fying a chain of causality between changes in ecosystem condition and human wel-fare. A common problem in valuation is that information is only available on some of the links in the chain and often in incompatible units. The MA can make a major contribution by making various disciplines better aware of what is needed toensure that their work can be combined with that of others to allow a full assess- ment of the consequences of altering ecosystem state and function. The ecosystem values in this sense are only one of the bases on which decisions on ecosystem management are and should be made. Many other factors, including notions of intrinsic value and other objectives that society might have (such as equity among different groups or generations), will also feed into the decision frame-work. Even when decisions are made on other bases, however, estimates of changes in utilitarian value provide invaluable information.

It will also use human sys- tem models that can examine, for instance, the impact of changes in eco- systems on production, consumption, and investment decisions by house-holds or that allow the economy-wide impacts of a change in production in a particular sector like agriculture to be evaluated. Finally, integrated models, combining both the environmental and human systems linkages,can increasingly be used at both global and sub-global scales. The MA aims to incorporate both formal scientific information and traditional or local knowledge. Traditional societies have nurtured andrefined systems of knowledge of direct value to those societies but also of considerable value to assessments undertaken at regional and global scales. This information often is unknown to science and can be an expression ofother relationships between society and nature in general and of sustain- able ways of managing natural resources in particular. To be credible and useful to decision-makers, all sources of information, whether scientific,traditional, or practitioner knowledge, must be critically assessed and vali- dated as part of the assessment process through procedures relevant to the form of knowledge. Since policies for dealing with the deterioration of ecosystem services are concerned with the future consequences of current actions, the devel- opment of scenarios of medium- to long-term changes in ecosystems, ser-vices, and drivers can be particularly helpful for decision-makers. Scenarios are typically developed through the joint involvement of decision-makers and scientific experts, and they represent a promising mechanism for link-ing scientific information to decision-making processes. They do not attempt to predict the future but instead are designed to indicate what science can and cannot say about the future consequences of alternativeplausible choices that might be taken in the coming years. The MA will use scenarios to summarize and communicate the diverse trajectories that the world's ecosystems may take in future decades. Sce-narios are plausible alternative futures, each an example of what might happen under particular assumptions. They can be used as a systematic method for thinking creatively about complex, uncertain futures. In thisway, they help us understand the upcoming choices that need to be made and highlight developments in the present. The MA will develop sce- narios that connect possible changes in drivers (which may be unpredict-able or uncontrollable) with human demands for ecosystem services. The scenarios will link these demands, in turn, to the futures of the services MA_CF-01-25.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:43 PM 22Summary 23 themselves and the aspects of human welfare that depend on them. The scenario building exercise will break new ground in several areas: \u0084development of scenarios for global futures linked explicitly to ecosys- tem services and the human consequences of ecosystem change, \u0084consideration of trade-offs among individual ecosystem services withinthe \"bundle\" of benefits that any particular ecosystem potentially pro-vides to society, \u0084assessment of modeling capabilities for linking socioeconomic driversand ecosystem services, and \u0084consideration of ambiguous futures as well as quantifiable uncertainties. The credibility of assessments is closely linked to how they address what is not known in addition to what is known. The consistent treat- ment of uncertainty is therefore essential for the clarity and utility of as- sessment reports. As part of any assessment process, it is crucial to esti-mate the uncertainty of findings even if a detailed quantitative appraisal of uncertainty is unavailable. Strategies and Interventions The MA will assess the use and effectiveness of a wide range of options forresponding to the need to sustainably use, conserve, and restore ecosys- tems and the services they provide. These options include incorporatingthe value of ecosystems in decisions, channeling diffuse ecosystem ben- efits to decision-makers with focused local interests, creating markets and property rights, educating and dispersing knowledge, and investing to im-prove ecosystems and the services they provide. As seen in Box 2 on the MA conceptual framework, different types of response options can affect the relationships of indirect to direct drivers, the influence of direct driv-ers on ecosystems, the human demand for ecosystem services, or the im- pact of changes in human well-being on indirect drivers. An effective strat- egy for managing ecosystems will involve a mix of interventions at allpoints in this conceptual framework. Mechanisms for accomplishing these interventions include laws, regu- lations, and enforcement schemes; partnerships and collaborations; thesharing of information and knowledge; and public and private action. The choice of options to be considered will be greatly influenced by both the temporal and the physical scale influenced by decisions, the uncertaintyof outcomes, cultural context, and the implications for equity and trade- MA_CF-01-25.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:43 PM 2324 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment offs. Institutions at different levels have different response options avail- able to them, and special care is required to ensure policy coherence. Decision-making processes are value-based and combine political and technical elements to varying degrees. Where technical input can play arole, a range of tools is available to help decision-makers choose among strategies and interventions, including cost-benefit analysis, game theory, and policy exercises. The selection of analytical tools should be deter-mined by the context of the decision, key characteristics of the decision problem, and the criteria considered to be important by the decision- makers. Information from these analytical frameworks is always combinedwith the intuition, experience, and interests of the decision-maker in shap- ing the final decisions. Risk assessment, including ecological risk assessment, is an established discipline and has a significant potential for informing the decision pro- cess. Finding thresholds and identifying the potential for irreversible change are important for the decision-making process. Similarly, environmentalimpact assessments designed to evaluate the impact of particular projects and strategic environmental assessments designed to evaluate the impact of policies both represent important mechanisms for incorporating thefindings of an ecosystem assessment into decision-making processes. Changes also may be required in decision-making processes themselves. Experience to date suggests that a number of mechanisms can improve theprocess of making decisions about ecosystem services. Broadly accepted norms for decision-making process include the following characteristics. Did the process: \u0084bring the best available information to bear? \u0084function transparently, use locally grounded knowledge, and involve all those with an interest in a decision? \u0084pay special attention to equity and to the most vulnerable populations? \u0084use decision analytical frameworks that take account of the strengths and limits of individual, group, and organizational information process-ing and action? \u0084consider whether an intervention or its outcome is irreversible and in- corporate procedures to evaluate the outcomes of actions and learn from them? \u0084ensure that those making the decisions are accountable? \u0084strive for efficiency in choosing among interventions? irreversibility, and cumulative, cross-scale, and marginal effects and of local, regional, and global costs, risk, andbenefits? The policy or management changes made to address problems and op- portunities related to ecosystems and their services, whether at local scalesor national or international scales, need to be adaptive and flexible in order to benefit from past experience, to hedge against risk, and to con- sider uncertainty. The understanding of ecosystem dynamics will alwaysbe limited, socioeconomic systems will continue to change, and outside determinants can never be fully anticipated. Decision-makers should con- sider whether a course of action is reversible and should incorporate, when-ever possible, procedures to evaluate the outcomes of actions and learn from them. Debate about exactly how to do this continues in discussions of adaptive management, social learning, safe minimum standards, andthe precautionary principle. But the core message of all approaches is the same: acknowledge the limits of human understanding, give special con- sideration to irreversible changes, and evaluate the impacts of decisions asthey unfold. MA_CF-01-25.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:43 PM 251Introduction and Conceptual Framework EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \u0084The goal of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) is to establish the scientific basis for actions needed to enhance the contribution of ecosystemsto human well-being without undermining their long-term productivity. \u0084The conceptual framework for the MA places human well-being as the centralfocus for assessment while recognizing that biodiversity and ecosystems alsohave intrinsic value and that people take decisions concerning ecosystemsbased on considerations of both well-being and intrinsic value. \u0084The MA conceptual framework assumes that a dynamic interaction exists be-tween people and ecosystems, with the changing human condition servingto both directly and indirectly drive change in ecosystems and with changesin ecosystems causing changes in human well-being. At the same time, manyother factors independent of the environment change the human condition,and many natural forces influence ecosystems. \u0084A full assessment of the interactions between people and ecosystems requiresa multiscale approach, as this better reflects the multiscale nature of decision-making, allows the examination of driving forces from outside particular re-gions, and provides a means of examining the differential impact of ecosys-tem changes and policy responses on different regions and groups withinregions. \u0084Effective incorporation of different types of knowledge in an assessment canboth improve the findings and help to increase their adoption by stakehold-ers if they see that their information has contributed to those findings. \u0084The usefulness of an assessment can be enhanced by identifying and seekingto address its structural biases. Any assessment empowers some stakeholdersat the expense of others by virtue of the selection of issues and of expert knowl-edge to be incorporated. Introduction Human well-being and progress toward sustainable development are vi- tally dependent upon Earth's ecosystems. The ways in which ecosystemsare affected by human activities will have consequences for the supply of 26 MA_CF-26-48.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 26Introduction and Conceptual Framework 27 ecosystem services\u2014including food, fresh water, fuelwood, and fiber\u2014and for the prevalence of diseases, the frequency and magnitude of floods and droughts, and local as well as global climate. Ecosystems also provide spiri- tual, recreational, educational, and other nonmaterial benefits to people.Changes in availability of all these ecosystem services can profoundly af- fect aspects of human well-being\u2014ranging from the rate of economic growth and health and livelihood security to the prevalence and persis-tence of poverty. Human demands for ecosystem services are growing rapidly. At the same time, humans are altering the capability of ecosystems to continueto provide many of these services. Management of this relationship is re- quired to enhance the contribution of ecosystems to human well-being without affecting their long-term capacity to provide services. The Mil-lennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) was established in 2001 by a part- nership of international institutions, and with support from governments, with the goal of enhancing the scientific basis for such management. The MA is being carried out through four working groups on condition and trends, scenarios, responses, and sub-global assessments. Each work- ing group will involve a regionally balanced group of between 50 and 400experts from dozens of countries as authors. The MA was launched in June 2001, the full assessment reports will undergo two rounds of peer- review by governments and experts in 2004, and the assessment reportswill be released in 2005. Five short synthesis reports containing the key policy-relevant findings will also be released at that time focused on the needs of particular users such as the international conventions and theprivate sector. The MA includes at this time up to 15 sub-global assess- ments that are applying the MA conceptual framework and methodology to assessments designed to meet needs at local, national, and regional scales,and the products of these assessments will be released over the next three years. Throughout the MA process, an ongoing dialogue is taking place involving experts preparing the assessment and intended users of the find-ings in order to focus the assessment on the needs of users and to ensure that users are sufficiently engaged in the process that they will be able to make direct use of the findings. All economies depend on ecosystem services. The production and manufacture of industrial wood products in the early 1990s contributed on the order of $400 billion to the global economy (Matthews et al. 2000).The world's fisheries contributed $55 billion in export value in 2000 (FAO 2000). Ecosystem services are particularly important to the economies of low-income developing countries. Between 1996 and 1998, for example, MA_CF-26-48.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 2728 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment agriculture represented nearly one fourth of the total gross domestic prod- uct of low-income countries (Wood et al. 2000). Certain ecosystem services\u2014such as inland fisheries and fuelwood pro- duction\u2014are particularly important to the livelihoods of poor people. Fish-eries provide the primary source of animal protein for nearly 1 billion people, and all but 4 of the 30 countries most dependent on fish as a protein source are in the developing world (WRI et al. 2000). In Cambodia, for instance,roughly 60 percent of the total animal protein consumed is from the fishery resources of the Tonle Sap, a large freshwater lake. In Malawi, freshwater fisheries supply 70-75 percent of the animal protein for both urban andrural low-income families (WRI et al. 2000). Similarly, more than 2 billion people depend directly on biomass fuels as their primary or sole source of energy, and in countries like Nepal, Uganda, Rwanda, and Tanzania, woodfuelmeets 80 percent or more of total energy requirements (Matthews et al. 2000). Moreover, poor people are highly vulnerable to health risks associ- ated with ecosystems: some 1-3 million people die each year from malaria,with 90 percent of them in Africa, where problems of poverty are most pressing (WHO 1997). Yet many ecosystem services are largely unrecognized in their global importance or in the pivotal role they play in meeting needs in particular countries and regions (Daily 1997a). For example, terrestrial and ocean ecosystems provide a tremendous service by absorbing nearly 60 percentof the carbon that is now emitted to the atmosphere from human activi- ties (IPCC 2000), thereby slowing the rate of global climate change. A number of cities\u2014including New York and Portland, Oregon, in the UnitedStates, Caracas in Venezuela, and Curitiba in Brazil\u2014reduce water treat- ment costs by investing in the protection of the natural water quality regulation provided by well-managed ecosystems (Reid 2001). The con-tribution of pollination to the worldwide production of 30 major fruit, vegetable, and tree crops is estimated to be approximately $54 billion a year (Kenmore and Krell 1998). Even in urban centers, ecosystems con-tribute significantly to well-being, both aesthetically and economically: Chicago's trees remove more than 5,000 tons of pollutants a year from the atmosphere (Nowak 1994). A society's \"natural capital\"\u2014its living and nonliving resources\u2014is a key determinant of its well-being. The full wealth of a nation can be evalu- ated only with due consideration to all forms of capital: manufactured,human, social, and natural. (See Figure 1.1.) Historically, given the abun- dant supply of natural capital and the application of new technologies to enhance the production of certain services, humanity has been remark- MA_CF-26-48.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 28Introduction and Conceptual Framework 29 ably successful in meeting growing demands for particular services. Be- tween 1967 and 1982, for example, conversion of native ecosystems toagricultural ecosystems, combined with a 2.2-percent annual increase in cereal yields, led to net increases in per capita food availability even though there was simultaneously a 32-percent increase in world population(Pinstrup-Andersen et al. 1997). But despite the success in meeting growth in aggregate demand, there have been significant problems in meeting demands in particular regions. Moreover, increased supply of certain goods,such as food, has often meant a trade-off with the supply of other ecosys- tem services, such as protecting water quality or supplying timber. Current demands for ecosystem services are growing rapidly and often already outstrip capacity. Between 1993 and 2020, world demand for rice, wheat, and maize is projected to increase by some 40 percent and live- stock production by more than 60 percent (Pinstrup-Andersen et al. 1997).Humans now withdraw about 20 percent of the base flow of the world's rivers, and during the past century withdrawals grew twice as fast as world population (Shiklomanov 1997; WHO 1997). By 2020, world use of in-dustrial roundwood could be anywhere from 23 to 55 percent over 1998 consumption levels (Brooks et al. 1996). These growing demands can no longer be met by tapping unexploited resources (Watson et al. 1998; Ayensu et al. 2000). A country can in- crease food supply by converting a forest to agriculture, but in so doing it decreases the supply of goods that may be of equal or greater importance,such as clean water, timber, biodiversity, or flood control. Even more sig- nificant, humans are increasingly undermining the productive capability of ecosystems to provide the services that people desire. For example, worldFIGURE 1.1 Society's Productive Base A society's productive base is composed of four types of capital: manufactured, human, social, and natural. MANUFACTURED CAPITAL buildings, roads, factoriesHUMAN CAPITAL knowledge and skill NATURAL CAPITAL living and nonliving resourcesSOCIAL CAPITAL institutions and relationships MA_CF-26-48.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 2930 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment fisheries are now declining due to overfishing, and some 40 percent of agricultural land has been strongly or very strongly degraded in the past 50 years by erosion, salinization, compaction, nutrient depletion, biological degradation, or pollution (WRI et al. 2000). Continuing degradation of the world's ecosystems is neither inevitable nor justified. Many instruments now exist that can aid in the management of human demand for ecosystem services and of impacts of human activi-ties on ecosystems. Recent progress in cost-effective technologies, policies, and regulation can contribute to management systems that can reduce and eventually reverse many of today's problems. Investments in improvedmanagement of ecosystem services tend to be highly leveraged strategies for sustainable development. Like the benefits of increased education or improved governance, the protection, restoration, and enhancement ofecosystem services tend to have multiple and synergistic benefits. For ex- ample, technology allows partial substitution of the ecosystem service of water purification through the construction of water treatment facilities.But by protecting the watershed to enable the ecosystem to provide this service instead, a variety of other benefits can often be obtained\u2014such as the maintenance of fisheries, reduction of flood risks, and protection ofrecreational and amenity values. New policies and initiatives in diverse economies and cultures illus- trate practical mechanisms for protecting vital ecosystem services andenhancing their contributions to human development. More effective bal- ances in the supply of various services can often be restored: reduction of subsidies that have contributed to excessive fishing harvest in many fish-eries, for instance, can lessen harvest pressure now, protect biodiversity, and ultimately lead to increased catch per unit of effort. Institutional arrangements such as changes in land tenure or rights to resources can help ensure that those paying to protect ecosystem ser- vices receive a fair share of the benefits: some power companies, for ex- ample, are now paying countries to protect and restore forests for theircarbon sequestration service as a means of offsetting carbon emissions (Daily and Ellison 2002). And in Costa Rica, a new national program pays private landowners for a suite of ecosystem services flowing fromforested (and reforested) land, including watershed protection, biodiversity conservation, and preservation of scenic beauty (Castro et al. 1998). Techniques for restoration can also be used: in the Murray-Darling River Basin of Australia, which supplies 75 percent of Australia's irrigation water and over 40 percent of the nation's agricultural produc- tion, native vegetation is being replanted as in con- MA_CF-26-48.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 30Introduction and Conceptual Framework 31 trolling devastating salinization of farmland (Murray-Darling Basin Min- isterial Council 2001). Roughly half of the world's poorest people live in marginal areas such as arid lands, steep slopes, or coastal margins that are prone to degradationand highly vulnerable to floods, droughts, or landslides (UNDP 1998). Some 80 percent of poor people in developing countries live in rural areas where people directly harvest ecosystem goods (Jazairy et al. 1992). Ap-BOX 1.1 Commitment to Sustainable Development The interlinkages among environmental management, poverty alleviation, and sus- tainable development have long been recognized by governments and international institutions.

MA_CF-26-48.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 3334 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment Many private-sector interests also depend on improved ecosystem man- agement. Industries directly dependent on biological resources, such as timber, fishing, or agriculture, have an ever-growing incentive for more effective and efficient management of ecosystem services as demand growsand new sources of supply become increasingly scarce. Far more signifi- cant, the condition of ecosystems has become a concern even to compa- nies not directly harvesting biological resources, such as the insuranceindustry in relation to events associated with climate change. Increased regulation and citizen scrutiny, along with new market incentives and para- digms of corporate stewardship, now drive industries to devote consider-able attention to minimizing ecosystem degradation and to factor the con- dition of the environment into their business strategy. The MA seeks to support and accelerate this process. Overview of Conceptual Framework While it is obvious that humans depend on Earth's ecosystems, it is an-other matter altogether to identify, assess, and undertake practical actionsthat can enhance well-being without undermining ecosystems. Humans influence, and are influenced by, ecosystems through multiple interacting pathways. Long-term provision of food in a particular region, for example,depends on the characteristics of the local ecosystem and local agricul- tural practices as well as global climate change, availability of crop genetic resources, access to markets, local income, rate of local population growth,and so forth. Changes at a local scale that may have positive impacts on the local supply of ecosystem services, such as clearing a forest to increase food production, may at the same time have highly detrimental impactsover larger scales: significant loss of forest cover in upstream areas may reduce dry-season water availability downstream, for instance. Given these complex links between ecosystems and human well- being, a prerequisite for both analysis and action is agreement on a basic conceptual framework. A well-designed framework for either assessment or action provides a logical structure for evaluating the system, ensuresthat the essential components of the system are addressed as well as the relationships among those components, gives appropriate weight to the different components of the system, and highlights important assumptionsand gaps in understanding. In the case of an ecosystem assessment, an appropriate conceptual frame- work must cut across spatial dimensions from local to global and acrosstemporal dimensions from the recent past to projections into the next MA_CF-26-48.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 34Introduction and Conceptual Framework 35 BOX 1.3 Overarching Questions Guiding the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Design The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment is designed to provide decision-makers with information to manage ecosystems in a more sustainable manner that will maintain both biodiversity and the ecosystem services that are essential to human well-being.Five overarching questions, along with the detailed lists of user needs provided by convention secretariats and the private sector, guide the issues being assessed: 1. What are the current conditions and trends of ecosystems and their associated human well-being? \u0084What ecosystems make what contributions to human well-being? \u0084How have ecosystems changed in the past and how has this increased or reduced their capacity to contribute to human well-being? \u2014What thresholds, regime shifts, or irreversible changes have been observed? \u2014What were the most critical factors affecting the observed changes? \u2014What are the costs, benefits, and risks of the observed changes in ecosystems, and how have these affected different sectors of society and different regions? 2. What are the plausible future changes in ecosystems and in the supply of and demand for ecosystem services and the consequent changes in health, livelihood, security, and other constituents of well-being? \u0084Under what circumstances are thresholds encountered or are regime shiftsor irreversible changes likely to occur? \u0084What are the most critical drivers and factors affecting future changes? \u0084What are the costs, benefits, and risks of plausible future human-induced changes in ecosystems, and how will these affect different sectors of society and different regions? 3. What can we do to enhance well-being and conserve ecosystems? What are the strengths and weaknesses of response options, actions, and processes thatcan be considered to realize or avoid specific futures? \u0084What are the trade-off implications of the response options? \u0084How does inertia in the social and natural systems affect managementdecisions? 4. What are the most robust findings and key uncertainties that affect provision of ecosystem services (including the consequent changes in health, livelihood,and security) and other management decisions and policy formulations? 5. What tools and methodologies developed and used in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment can strengthen capacity to assess ecosystems, the services they provide, their impacts on human well-being, and the implica- and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment century. It must encompass the accessibility and sustainability of natural resources and systems and their products for the benefit of human societ- ies as well as for the maintenance of these systems in their own right. It must examine how the capacities of ecosystems are being compromised orenhanced, and what mechanisms can be brought to bear to improve the access and delivery of services for human well-being. It must examine all resources simultaneously and in an integrated manner, and must evaluatepast and potential future trade-offs and their consequences. To meet all these requirements in a single operational framework for an assessment is a bold venture. Without such comprehensiveness, however, an assessmentcannot achieve its goal of understanding the multiple and complex natu- ral and social drivers that are affecting ecosystems and how society can respond in positive ways to maintain ecosystem services that are central tohuman well-being. This report describes the conceptual framework that has been devel- oped for the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. We believe that thisframework will be of value to a wide range of analysts and decision-makers who are confronting the challenge of factoring considerations of ecosys- tems and their services into planning and management, whether it be thedesign of a business strategy for an agribusiness or the drafting of a na- tional development plan. The conceptual framework elaborated here has been designed to ad- dress a set of core questions developed through extensive interaction with users of the MA, including international conventions, national govern- ments, the private sector, and civil society. (See Box 1.3.) The basic framework for the MA is shown in Box 1.4. The figure lists the issues that will be addressed in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and illustrates their interrelationships. It cannot, of course, portray thecomplexity of these interactions in their temporal and spatial domains. In particular, the apparent linearity of the relationships between elements of the figure does not fully capture the complex interactions that can occuramong them. Given these caveats, the figure and the issues it includes capture the essence of the approach of the MA and provide a framework for structuring the work that needs to be accomplished in the process.Human well-being and poverty reduction are indicated in the upper left- hand box of the conceptual framework diagram. They are placed in this central location to emphasize the primary focus of these issues to the Mil-lennium Ecosystem Assessment. The MA conceptual framework is designed to assess the consequences of changes in ecosystems for human well-being.

The framework allows examination of the degree to which this is true and un-BOX 1.4 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Conceptual Framework Changes in factors that indirectly affect ecosystems, such as population, technol- ogy, and lifestyle (upper right corner of figure), can lead to changes in factors di- rectly affecting ecosystems, such as the catch of fisheries or the application of fertil- izers to increase food production (lower right corner). The resulting changes in theecosystem (lower left corner) cause the ecosystem services to change and thereby affect human well-being. These interactions can take place at more than one scale and can cross scales. For example, a global market may lead to regional loss of forestcover, which increases flood magnitude along a local stretch of a river. Similarly, the interactions can take place across different time scales. Actions can be taken either to respond to negative changes or to enhance positive changes at almost all pointsin this framework (black cross bars). MA_CF-26-48.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 3738 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment der what circumstances. We propose in the work of the MA that the pro- cesses maintaining human well-being be the center and keystone of most of the work that is done. In doing this work there is a clear appreciation of the intrinsic value of ecosystems, independent of the services that theyprovide. In order to partition the work of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, we examine the various services that ecosystems provide and how thoseservices influence human well-being, as well as the forces that have the capacity to alter these services. More specifically, we consider ecosystem services to be the benefits people obtain from ecosystems. For our analysis,we divide these into provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting ser- vices. These categories overlap extensively, and the purpose is not to estab- lish a taxonomy but rather to ensure that the analysis addresses the entirerange of services. There are other ways of categorizing ecosystem services, but the particular approach of the MA seeks to distinguish supporting eco- system services, which are important for maintaining ecosystems, from thosethat provide direct benefits to people. Chapter 2 provides a detailed treat- ment of the role of ecosystems and their services within the MA framework. Changes in ecosystems affect life on Earth independent of human uses of their services, but we focus particular attention on the consequences of changes in ecosystem services for human well-being. Just as it is not enough to examine a single ecosystem service in isolation from its interaction withother services, so too it is insufficient to focus on only a single attribute of human well-being. Changes in ecosystem services affect many aspects of human well-being. We emphasize in particular the equity dimensionsof these changes. Because poor people are often most directly dependent on harvesting ecosystem services, they are often most vulnerable to changes in ecosystems. This framework emphasizes that it is not just the average im-pact on human well-being that is of interest, but rather the consequences of ecosystem change for different groups of people. We describe the framework used to examine the consequences for human well-being in Chapter 3. Understanding the factors that are causing ecosystem services to change is essential to designing interventions that can have positive benefits for ecosystems and their services. For convenience of analysis, we considerfactors that affect ecosystems directly either through natural processes (such as volcanic eruptions or changes in the sun's energy) or through human actions, such as: \u0084changes in local land use and land river flow; MA_CF-26-48.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 Framework 39 \u0084species introductions and removals; \u0084external inputs (such as fertilizer use, pest control, irrigation water); \u0084discharge of pollutants; or \u0084harvest of crops, wildlife, or fish. These factors have had, and are continuing to have, dramatic impacts on ecosystem structure and processes and hence on the services they pro-vide. Many of these factors are in turn driven by demographic, economic, technological, sociopolitical, cultural and religious, physical, biological, and chemical forces that we call indirect drivers of change. For any given decision-maker, some of these drivers are exogenous, meaning that the individual's decisions will not affect them, while others are endogenous, meaning that decisions directly affect the driver. Thusthe small farmer in Africa can decide how much fertilizer to use but can- not influence the global maize price. In contrast, decisions of a finance minister of a major country could influence global maize prices. The roleof the direct and indirect drivers of change and their links to decision- makers are examined in Chapter 4. By depicting a closed loop between its major boxes, the figure in Box 1.4 reflects the existence of feedbacks within the system. In the course of time, indirect drivers are changed not only by long-term general trends, but even more by people's and society's strategies to cope with changingecosystems in order to maintain well-being. The arrows among the princi- pal contextual boxes of the figure indicate the causal interactions among the components of the system and the general directions of the interac-tions. The arrows present simplified \"if-then\" relationships among com- ponents: for example, if there is a change in a direct driver, then by defini- tion there will be a change in the ecosystem. In reality, of course, theinteractions and their directions are much more complex than depicted. An important feature of the MA conceptual framework is its multiscale structure, which is depicted in the conceptual framework by the threegeographic scales (local, regional, global) and two time scales (short term, long term). The multiscale approach is described in Chapter 5. Briefly, a multiscale assessment contains interlinked assessments conducted at manydifferent geographic scales, which could range from local communities to the entire planet. (See Box 1.5.) It also addresses different time scales, from months or years to decades or centuries. The multiscale componentof the MA includes a set of sub-global assessments being conducted within the MA framework, which are now under way or being developed in the MA_CF-26-48.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 3940 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment Arafura and Timor Seas, Brazil, Canada, the Caribbean Sea, the moun- tains of Central Asia, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Egypt, Fiji,the Hindu Kush-Himalayas, India, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Portugal, Russia, Southern Africa (including Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe), Sweden, Trinidadand Tobago, and Viet Nam. In addition, a pilot assessment has been com- pleted in Norway. We expect that other similar sub-global assessments will be established in the next several years.BOX 1.5 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Sub-global Components Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) sub-global assessments use the MA con- ceptual framework; examine conditions, scenarios, and response options; and agree to a set of criteria concerning peer-review, data handling, stakeholder involvement, and intellectual property rights. Each sub-global assessment has significant flexibil-ity in order to meet the needs of its stakeholders effectively. At the same time, the set of sub-global assessments interact extensively to take full advantage of the op- portunities for cross-scale integration. The MA includes a set of fully approved andfunded sub-global assessments, candidate assessments that have agreed to meet the MA criteria and are now in the design and fundraising stage, and initial ideas for assessments. (See map.) In addition to those shown on the map, close links havebeen established with ongoing assessments being undertaken by the European En- vironment Agency and other institutions. More sub-global assessments are expected to join the MA in 2003. 1 ASB Sites: Sites of the Alternatives to Slash-and-Burn Consortium coordinated by the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF). These sites are located in humid tropical forests around the world:Western Brazilian/Peruvian Amazon; Southern Cameroon; MA_CF-26-48.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 40Introduction and Conceptual Framework 41 The choices that people make concerning ecosystems are shaped by what they value in the system. Valuation of ecosystems and their services is unusually difficult, partly because of the intrinsic values that some people ascribe to ecosystems and partly because of the challenge of measuringeconomic values associated with nonmarketed ecosystem services (Wall et al. 1999; Daily et al. 2000). Typically, economists rely on market prices to provide a measure of the worth of various commodities, but for manyecosystem services, markets simply do not exist. In some cases this is be- cause the costs of transaction and monitoring are too high. Economic activities affected by ecological interactions involving long geographical distances provide one example of valuation problems. An- other example is interactions separated by large temporal distances (the effect of carbon emissions on climate in the distant future, in a world whereforward markets do not exist because future generations cannot negotiate with people today). Then there are situations (the atmosphere, aquifers, the open seas) in which the distribution of a resource makes private prop-erty rights impossible and so keeps markets from existing. In other cases, ill-specified or unprotected property rights prevent markets from being formed (as happens frequently with mangroves and coral reefs) or makethem function incorrectly even if they do get formed. In each of these cases, markets are not providing the correct signals with regard to the value of an ecosystem service. Sound management thus requires alterna-tive means for measuring value as well as policies that can internalize the externalities associated with ecosystem services. Chapter 6 summarizes the various frameworks for thinking about the value of ecosystems anddescribes how this will be approached in the MA. Chapter 7 explains the basic analytical approach that can be used in an integrated ecosystem assessment, focusing on the three basic elements ofthe MA: assessment of current conditions and historical trends; assess- ment of the consequences of plausible future changes in driving forces; and assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of various response options. Ultimately, the most important components of the conceptual frame- work are the black cross bars in the figure in Box 1.4 indicating interven- tion points where the dynamics of the system can be altered. A major goalof an integrated ecosystem assessment is to provide decision-makers with the information they need to make wise choices concerning these strate- gies and interventions. This decision-making process is described inChapter 8. Much of the work of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment will in- volve evaluating interventions that have been successful in the past, as MA_CF-26-48.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 4142 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment well as proposing novel possibilities that fit the current situation. The MA itself will not recommend specific policies or interventions, since the choice of policies and interventions must be influenced by more than just science. Following the experience of previous assessments, such as the In-tergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Ozone As- sessment, the MA will appraise the strengths and weaknesses of various options, with examples of where and why they have worked. The purposeof a scientific assessment is not to assume a decision-making role by actu- ally selecting the most appropriate option, but rather to contribute to the decision-makers' understanding of the scientific underpinning and impli-cations of various decisions. The conceptual framework used in the MA differs from the standard environmental impact assessment (EIA) framework in that it places eco-systems and the environment in a central role in the effort to reach devel- opment goals. The MA framework is designed to allow the examination of how changes to ecosystems influence human outcomes. The EIAapproach, in contrast, focuses on the impacts of human actions on the environment and is designed to explore the relative costs and benefits of various project options. Ecosystems and the environment are treated asexternalities in an EIA (affected by development activities), whereas they are internal in the MA framework\u2014something that can be managed sustainably in order to contribute to human development. The framework also differs from the commonly used pressure-state- impact-response (PSIR) framework by virtue of the feedbacks that it in- corporates. The PSIR framework is designed to focus on the impacts ofpressures (driving forces) on the environment and the responses that can be taken to alter negative impacts. The MA framework extends the PSIR framework by incorporating the consequences of the environmental im-pacts on human well-being and as a result turns the relatively linear PSIR framework into a more dynamic system in which environmental changes (the I) can change the human condition and thereby change the pressures(the P). Equally significant, the MA framework differs from frameworks such as the PSIR or EIA by explicitly including multiscale considerations, as de-scribed in the next section. Assessments conducted at different geographic and temporal scales will inevitably focus on different issues and reach dif- ferent conclusions. No assessment can meet all needs at all scales, but amultiscale framework helps to provide decision-makers with a more com- plete view of both the issues that need to be addressed and the relative merits of interventions that can be made at different levels of governance. MA_CF-26-48.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 42Introduction and Conceptual Framework 43 Each of the four MA Working Groups organizes its work within this conceptual framework. The Condition and Trends Working Group will examine each box of the figure in Box 1.4 (drivers, services, well-being) and their interactions over the past 50 years. The Scenarios Working Groupwill examine each box and their interactions for different plausible future changes in driving forces, extending out 50 years (and for some variables, 100 years). The Responses Working Group will examine the strategy andintervention points in the figure, which depict options that are available to achieve particular outcomes in the delivery of services from ecosys- tems. Finally, the Sub-global Working Group will examine all these fea-tures (condition, scenarios, and responses) for each of the MA sub-global assessments but at the scale of local communities, river basins, or nations. The Multiscale Approach The MA is structured as a multiscale assessment in order to enable itsfindings to be of greater use at the many levels of decision-making. A global assessment cannot meet the needs of local farmers, nor can a localassessment meet the collective needs of parties to a global convention. A multiscale assessment can also help remedy the biases that are inevitably introduced when an evaluation is done at a single geographic scale. Forexample, while a national ecosystem assessment might identify substan- tial national benefits from a particular policy change, a local assessment would be more likely to identify whether that particular community wouldbe a winner or loser as a result of the policy change. Through the use of a multiscale approach, the findings of the assess- ment at any scale can in principle be enhanced by virtue of the informa-tion and perspectives from other scales. Several factors act together to strengthen the findings of a multiscale assessment. First, a multiscale struc- ture helps to ensure that perspectives or concerns at any given scale arereflected in the analysis and conclusions at other scales. For example, a local community may have quite a different perception of the costs and benefits of various features of the ecosystem than the \"global\" community.Neither perspective is right or wrong, but a single-scale assessment could miss important differences that could affect the usefulness of various ap- proaches to managing ecosystem change. Second, a multiscale assessment enables the evaluation of cross-scale factors. Ecosystems are highly differentiated in space and time, and sound management requires careful local planning and action. At the same time,local assessments are insufficient, because some processes are global and MA_CF-26-48.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 4344 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment because local goods, services, matter, and energy are often transferred across regions. A local assessment of a downstream farming community, for ex- ample, would be incomplete without information on upstream activities influencing the community's supply of fresh water. Finally, a multiscale assessment allows evaluation of the scale- dependence of various actions and policies. Often the aggregate beneficial impacts of a policy change at a national scale may obscure the winnersand losers at a local scale. Although differential impacts of change will always exist, the net benefits of actions and policies can be enhanced through more careful assessment of these scale-dependent impacts. The multiscale framework of the MA is unique among international assessments. Various other global programs include strong regional analy- ses (such as the Third Assessment Report of the IPCC) or produce global findings by aggregating multiple regional assessments (for example, the Global International Waters Assessment, and the Global Environment Outlook ). The sub-global components of the MA, however, are not just regional analyses or case studies; they are formal assessments undertaken at the sub-global scale, with their own stakeholders, authorizing environ- ments, and user-driven processes. Types of Knowledge Assessed Scientific assessments, particularly global assessments, have generally beenbased on a particular western epistemology (way of knowing), one thatoften excludes local knowledge, ignores cultural values, and disregards the needs of local communities. Sources such as lay knowledge or practitio- ners' knowledge tend to be excluded, since assessment procedures oftendefine the information base for an assessment to be the published scien- tific literature. Scientists and policy-makers alike have become aware of the need to establish new assessment processes that can accommodate and value these different ways of knowing. For example, a rich body of knowledge concern- ing the history of ecosystem change and appropriate responses exists withinlocal and traditional knowledge systems, as recognized in principle in the Convention on Biological Diversity. It makes little sense to exclude such knowledge just because it has not been published. Moreover, incorporationof traditional and local knowledge can greatly strengthen the legitimacy of an assessment process in the eyes of indigenous and local communities. Similarly, substantial knowledge concerning both ecosystems and policy interventions is held within the private sector among the \"practitioners\" MA_CF-26-48.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 44Introduction and Conceptual Framework 45 of ecosystem management, yet only a small fraction of this information is ever published in the scientific literature. Effective incorporation of different types of knowledge in an assess- ment can both improve the findings and help to increase their adoptionby stakeholders if they believe that their information has contributed to those findings. At the same time, no matter what sources of knowledge are incorporated into an assessment, effective mechanisms must be establishedto judge whether the information provides a sound basis for decisions. Relatively little experience can be drawn on today of assessment mecha- nisms that effectively bridge epistemologies. Within the MA, a concertedeffort is being made to enable the incorporation of traditional and local knowledge through the establishment of mechanisms for verification even where that knowledge is not first published in peer-reviewed literature.(See Chapter 7.) The MA's multiscale structure provides an unparalleled opportunity to incorporate both traditional and scientific knowledge in the process, since assessments conducted at the smaller scales of individualcommunities or watersheds will tend to involve much more input of lay and traditional knowledge. Minimizing Structural Biases A scientific assessment is a social process to bring the findings of scienceto bear on the needs of decision-makers. The success of such assessments rests on their saliency, credibility, and legitimacy (Clark and Dickson 1999).Scientific information is salient if it is perceived to be relevant or of value to particular groups who might use it to change management approaches, behavior, or policy decisions. It is credible if peers within the scientificcommunity perceive the scientific and technical information and conclu- sions to be authoritative and believable. It is legitimate if the process of assembling the information is perceived to be fair and open to input fromkey political constituencies, such as the private sector, governments, and civil society. The MA has been designed to meet these three basic criteria. But even the most credible and scientifically unbiased assessment will necessarily give power to some stakeholders at the expense of others. The usefulness of an assessment to different stakeholders is strongly influenced, to begin with, by which stakeholders are involved in choosing its focus.For example, in the face of food insecurity in a particular region, some people may frame the issue as a problem of production and request an assessment of new agricultural technologies for the region, while othersmay see it as a problem of resource ownership or purchasing power and MA_CF-26-48.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 4546 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment request an assessment of experience with land redistribution or employ- ment-generating opportunities. Similarly, a global assessment of ecosys- tem services would naturally examine the role of ecosystems as a source of carbon sequestration, but farmers would be unlikely to select this as animportant service unless a mechanism were in place for them to be paid for that sequestration. The MA, by virtue of its multiscale, multistakeholder structure, will be more neutral with regards to these concerns of focus than other global assessments, but it is not devoid of structural biases. Because its primary authorizing environment is governmental, it will be devoting particularattention to decision-making needs of governments as articulated through the parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Convention to Combat Desertification, the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, and theConvention on Migratory Species. In addition, although the MA is a multiscale assessment, it will include only about 15 sub-global compo- nents. Clearly, an international assessment with thousands of local com-munity components would more strongly reflect the agenda of local com- munities than an assessment with 15. Thus although the MA for the first time provides a way to increase the input of local or national stakeholdersinto questions being addressed by an international assessment, it falls short of being scale-neutral and will inevitably focus particular attention on global concerns and questions. An assessment's usefulness to different stakeholders will also depend on the composition of the scientific community that conducts it. The most effective global assessments, such as the IPCC and the Ozone As-sessment, emphasize regional balance of the scientists involved and the involvement of both natural and social sciences. Both regional and dis- ciplinary balance is essential to ensure the credibility and legitimacy ofthe process. Yet considerable knowledge of ecosystems and their influ- ence on human well-being is held not just in the formal scientific litera- ture but in traditional and local knowledge systems as well. As notedearlier, therefore, the MA is seeking to expand the community of ex- perts conducting the assessment to include local and traditional knowl- edge. Inevitably, however, while the MA will make an evolutionary steptoward more holistic treatment of different ways of knowing the world, the process will still give greater emphasis to peer-reviewed scientific literature. No assessment can hope to be all things to all people, nor should it be\u2014as it would become highly diffuse. But recognition of the structural biases that exist in any assessment can aid in the interpretation of the MA_CF-26-48.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 46Introduction and Conceptual Framework 47 findings. And by identifying and describing structural biases, it may be possible to address some of them during the course of the assessment. Use in Decision-making Decision-makers confront the full complexity of social-environmental sys-tems with nearly every decision that they take. Scientific assessments, in contrast, have traditionally focused on narrow slices of that complexity. But they increasingly can provide insights into the more complex realitiesthat are at the core of the most difficult choices confronting policy- makers. These tough choices involve trade-offs among different sectors, goals, or time frames. They often involve trade-offs between national andlocal benefits. And they involve actions to address the structural causes of problems like poverty, not just the symptoms. Can integrated ecosystem assessments and the information that they make available actually contribute to the real world of decision-making? Despite the growing pressures on ecosystems today, this period in history offers an unprecedented opportunity to modify the development paths beingpursued around the world to ones that will secure and sustain human well- being. The last decade has seen progress in understanding how to address environmental and development issues and how to decrease the impact ofindustry on the environment, but more progress needs to be made in ad- dressing environment and development simultaneously. Today, the world is on the threshold of an era in which integrated environmental manage-ment can become a central tool in achieving sustainable development goals. The factors that may have set the stage for this transition include: \u0084Advances in science. Considerable scientific progress has been made in the past several decades in understanding the complex interactions both within ecosystems and between ecosystems, human activities, and hu-man well-being. \u0084Advances in information technologies and improved access to information. Computers and data systems now allow analysts and decision-makers to better monitor ecosystems and predict the consequences of variouschanges; at the same time, they help provide stakeholders with accessto information they need for both decision-making and accountability. \u0084Changing paradigms of well-being and poverty. Historically, human well- being was largely defined in terms of income and consumption; it isnow recognized to include the material minimum for a good life, free-dom and choice, health, good social relations, security, and peace ofmind and spiritual experience. MA_CF-26-48.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 4748 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment \u0084Policy and institutional reform. Pressures on ecosystems may be exacer- bated by misguided policies and institutional arrangements, such as in-appropriate subsidies and inequitable patterns of ownership and accessto resources. Decision-makes are increasingly aware of the long-termcosts of these policies, and many countries are beginning to take stepsto reform them. \u0084Changing governance. The relative power of nation-states has dimin- ished with the growth of power and influence of a far more complexarray of institutions, including regional governments, multinationalcompanies, the United Nations, and civil society organizations. Many small stakeholders are also increasingly involved in decision-making. These economic, scientific, institutional, and technological changes have created a new environment for decision-making and action. It is an environment in which multiple users in governments, the private sector,and civil society all have needs for better scientific information and under- standing such as that provided through assessments like the MA. And it is an environment in which the general public can make use of informationto hold decision-makers accountable. It is also an environment in which it is possible to envision the emergence of new institutional and policy ar- rangements and changes in rights and access to resources that may be nec-essary to address fully the challenges of sustainable ecosystem manage- ment. In the words of United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his Millennium Report to the United Nations General Assembly: It is impossible to devise effective environmental policy unless it is based on sound scientific information. While major advances in data collection havebeen made in many areas, large gaps in our knowledge remain. In particular,there has never been a comprehensive global assessment of the world's majorecosystems. The planned Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, a major inter-national collaborative effort to map the health of our planet, is a response tothis need (Annan 2000). Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment describes the framework within which such an assessment of the health of the planet can be made. In 2005, the MA will release a series of global assessmentsundertaken through the application of that framework. MA_CF-26-48.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 482Ecosystems and Their Services EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \u0084An ecosystem is a dynamic complex of plant, animal, and microorganism com- munities and the nonliving environment, interacting as a functional unit. Hu-mans are an integral part of ecosystems. \u0084A well-defined ecosystem has strong interactions among its components andweak interactions across its boundaries. A useful ecosystem boundary is the place where a number of discontinuities coincide, for instance in the distribu-tion of organisms, soil types, drainage basins, or depth in a water body. At alarger scale, regional and even globally distributed ecosystems can be evalu-ated based on a commonality of basic structural units. \u0084Ecosystem services are the benefits p eople obtain from ecosystems. These include provisioning services such as food and water; regulating services suchas flood and disease control; cultural services such as spiritual, recreational,and cultural benefits; and supporting services, such as nutrient cycling, thatmaintain the conditions for life on Earth. \u0084Biodiversity is the variability among living organisms. It includes diversity withinand among species and diversity within and among ecosystems. Biodiversity is the source of many ecosystem goods, such as food and genetic resources, and changes in biodiversity can influence the supply of ecosystem services. \u0084People seek many services from ecosystems and thus perceive the condition of an ecosystem in relation to its ability to provide desired services. The abilityof ecosystems to deliver services can be assessed by a variety of qualitativeand quantitative methods. \u0084An assessment of the condition of ecosystems, the provision of services, andtheir relation to human well-being requires an integrated approach. This en-ables a decision process to determine which service or set of services is val-ued most highly and how to develop approaches to maintain services bymanaging the system sustainably. Introduction Millions of species populate Earth. The vast majority gain energy to sup- port their metabolism either directly from the sun, in the case of plants,or, in the case of animals and microbes, from other organisms through feeding on plants, predation, parasitism, or decomposition. In the pursuit of life and through their capacity to reproduce, organisms use energy, wa- 49 MA_CF-49-70.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:19 AM 4950 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment ter, and nutrients. Terrestrial plants obtain water principally from soil, while animals get it mainly from free-standing water in the environment or from their food. Plants obtain most of their nutrients from the soil or water, while animals tend to derive their nutrients from other organisms.Microorganisms are the most versatile, obtaining nutrients from soil, wa- ter, their food, or other organisms. Organisms interact with one another in many ways, including competitive, predatory, parasitic, and facilitativeways, such as pollination, seed dispersal, and the provision of habitat. These fundamental linkages among organisms and their physical and biological environment constitute an interacting and ever-changing sys-tem that is known as an ecosystem. Humans are a component of these ecosystems. Indeed, in many regions they are the dominant organism. Whether dominant or not, however, humans depend on ecosystem prop-erties and on the network of interactions among organisms and within and among ecosystems for sustenance, just like all other species. As organisms interact with each other and their physical environment, they produce, acquire, or decompose biomass and the carbon-based or or- ganic compounds associated with it. They also move minerals from the wa- ter, sediment, and soil into and among organisms, and back again into thephysical environment. Terrestrial plants also transport water from the soil into the atmosphere. In performing these functions, they provide materials to humans in the form of food, fiber, and building materials and they con-tribute to the regulation of soil, air, and water quality. These relationships sound simple in general outline, but they are in fact enormously complex, since each species has unique requirements forlife and each species interacts with both the physical and the biological environment. Recent perturbations, driven principally by human activi- ties, have added even greater complexity by changing, to a large degree,the nature of those environments. Ecosystem Boundaries and Categories Although the notion of an ecosystem is ancient, ecosystems first became aunit of study less than a century ago, when Arthur Tansley provided an initial scientific conceptualization in 1935 (Tansley 1935) and Raymond Lindeman did the first quantitative study in an ecosystem context in theearly 1940s (Lindeman 1942). The first textbook built on the ecosystem concept, written by Eugene Odum, was published in 1953 (Odum 1953). Thus the ecosystem concept, so central to understanding the nature of life on Earth, is actually a relatively new research and management approach. MA_CF-49-70.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:19 AM 50Ecosystems and Their Services 51 Tansley's formulation of an ecosystem included \"not only the organ- ism-complex, but also the whole complex of physical factors forming what we call the environment\" (Tansley 1935:299). He noted that ecosystems \"are of the most varied kinds and sizes.\" The main identifying feature of anecosystem is that it is indeed a system; its location or size is important, but secondary. Following Tansley and subsequent developments, we chose to use the definition of an ecosystem adopted by the Convention on Biological Di- versity (CBD): \"a dynamic complex of plant, animal and micro-organism communities and their nonliving environment interacting as a functionalunit\" (United Nations 1992:Article 2). Biodiversity and ecosystems are closely related concepts. Biodiversity is defined by the CBD as \"the variability among living organisms from allsources including, inter alia , terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosys- tems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems\" (United Na-tions 1992:Article 2). Diversity thus is a structural feature of ecosystems, and the variability among ecosystems is an element of biodiversity. The parties to the convention have endorsed the \"ecosystem approach\" as theirprimary framework for action. (See Box 2.1.) For analysis and assessment, it is important to adopt a pragmatic view of ecosystem boundaries, depending on the questions being asked. In one sense,the entire biosphere of Earth is an ecosystem since the elements interact. At a smaller scale, the guiding principle is that a well-defined ecosystem has strong interactions among its components and weak interactions across its boundaries. (See also Chapter 5.) A practical approach to the spatial de- limitation of an ecosystem is to build up a series of overlays of significant factors, mapping the location of discontinuities, such as in the distributionof organisms, the biophysical environment (soil types, drainage basins, depth in a water body), and spatial interactions (home ranges, migration patterns, fluxes of matter). A useful ecosystem boundary is the place where a numberof these relative discontinuities coincide. At a larger scale, regional and even globally distributed ecosystems can be evaluated based on the com- monality of basic structural units. We use such a framework in the MA forthe global analysis of ecosystem properties and changes. The global assessment being undertaken by the MA is based on 10 categories: marine, coastal, inland water, forest, dryland, island, moun-tain, polar, cultivated, and urban. (See Box 2.2.) These categories are not ecosystems themselves, but each contains a number of ecosystems.

For that reason, the ecosystem approach has been endorsed by the Convention on Biological Diversity(CBD) and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) conceptual framework is entirely consistent with this approach. The CBD defines the ecosystem approach as follows: The Ecosystem Approach is a strategy for the integrated management of land, water and living resources that promotes conservation and sustain-able use in an equitable way. Thus, the application of the ecosystemapproach will help to reach a balance of the three objectives of the Con-vention: conservation; sustainable use; and the fair and equitable sharingof the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources. An eco-system approach is based on the application of appropriate scientific meth-odologies focused on levels of biological organization, which encompassthe essential structure, processes, functions and interactions among or-ganisms and their environment. It recognizes that humans, with theircultural diversity, are an integral component of many ecosystems. According to the CBD, the term ecosystem can refer to any functioning unit at any scale. This approach requires adaptive management to deal with the complex and dynamic nature of ecosystems and the absence of complete knowledge or un-derstanding of their functioning. It does not preclude other management and con- servation approaches, such as biosphere reserves, protected areas, and single-species conservation programs, or other approaches carried out under existing national policyand legislative frameworks; rather, it could integrate all these approaches and other methodologies to deal with complex situations. As described in the CBD, there is no single way to implement the ecosystem approach, as it depends on local, provin-cial, national, regional, and global conditions. The conceptual framework of the MA provides a useful assessment structure that can contribute to the implementation of the CBD's ecosystem approach. By way ofanalogy, decision-makers would not make a decision about financial policy in a country without examining the condition of the economic system, since informa- tion on the economy of a single sector such as manufacturing would be insufficient.The same applies to ecological systems or ecosystems. Decisions can be improved by considering the interactions among the parts of the system. For instance, the drain- ing of wetlands may increase food production, but sound decisions also require in-formation on whether the potential added costs associated with the increased risk of downstream flooding or other changes in ecosystem services might outweigh those benefits. MA_CF-49-70.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:19 AM 52Ecosystems and Their Services 53 and do overlap. Ecosystems within each category share a suite of biologi- cal, climatic, and social factors that tend to differ across categories. More specifically, there generally is greater similarity within than between each category in: \u0084climatic conditions; \u0084geophysical conditions; \u0084dominant use by humans; \u0084surface (based on type of vegetative cover in terrestrial ecosystems or on fresh water, brackish water, or salt water in aquatic ecosystems); \u0084species composition; and \u0084resource management systems and institutions. The factors characterizing ecosystems in each category are highly in- terrelated. Thus, for example, grasslands are found in many areas where potential evaporation exceeds precipitation. Grasslands, in turn, tend tobe used by humans either as rangeland or for agricultural purposes. The areas used for rangeland tend to have pastoral, sometimes nomadic, re- source management systems. Thus these factors\u2014high potential evapora-tion relative to precipitation, grassland cover, use for livestock, and pasto- ral or nomadic management systems\u2014tend to be found together. (This is typical of the dryland system category in Box 2.2.) We use overlapping categories in the global MA analysis because this better reflects real-world biological, geophysical, social, and economic in- teractions, particularly at these relatively large scales. For example, an im-portant issue for ecosystems and human well-being in forested regions re- lates to the impact of forest harvest or conversion on the timing, quantity, and quality of water runoff. Given the importance of this interaction, it ishelpful to analyze an area dominated by forest land cover as a single ecosys- tem even if it contains some freshwater and agricultural areas within it, rather than analyzing the forest, agriculture, and freshwater ecosystems sepa-rately, since this allows for a more holistic analysis of these interactions. Ecosystem Services Ecosystem services are the benefits people obtain from ecosystems. Thisdefinition is derived from two other commonly referenced and representa-tive definitions: Ecosystem services are the conditions and processes through which natural ecosystems, and the species that make them up, sustain and fulfill human MA_CF-49-70.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:19 AM 5354 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment BOX 2.2 Reporting Categories Used in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Social and ecological systems can be categorized in an infinite number of ways. For the purposes of reporting the global Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) find- ings, we have developed a practical, tractable, sufficiently rich classification based on 10 systems. Thus, for example, the MA will report on \"forest systems,\" defined tobe areas with at least 40 percent canopy (tree) cover. Using this approach, a forest system will contain a variety of different types of ecosystems, such as freshwater ecosystems, agroecosystems, and so forth. But all areas within the boundaries of theforest system as defined here will tend to share a suite of biological, climatic, and social factors, so the system categories provide a useful framework for analyzing the consequences of ecosystem change for human well-being. Because the boundariesof these reporting categories overlap, any place on Earth may fall into more than one category. Thus a wetland ecosystem in a coastal region, for instance, may be examined both in the MA analysis of \"coastal systems\" as well as in the analysis of\"inland water systems.\" The following table lists the basic boundary definitions that will be used in the global MA analysis. In a number of cases the MA will also examine conditions andchanges in ecosystems with reference to more than one boundary definition. For example, although we use a boundary of 40 percent tree (canopy) cover as our basic definition of the forest category, another widely accepted definition of \"forests\" is atleast 10 percent canopy cover.

MA_CF-49-70.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:19 AM 5556 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment the tangible and the intangible benefits humans obtain from ecosystems, which are sometimes separated into \"goods\" and \"services\" respectively. Like the term ecosystem itself, the concept of ecosystem services is relatively recent\u2014it was first used in the late 1960s (e.g., King 1966;Helliwell 1969). Research on ecosystem services has grown dramatically within the last decade (e.g., Costanza et al. 1997; Daily 1997a; Daily et al. 2000; de Groot et al. 2002). It is common practice in economics both to refer to goods and services separately and to include the two concepts under the term services. Al- though \"goods,\" \"services,\" and \"cultural services\" are often treated sepa-rately for ease of understanding, for the MA we consider all these benefits together as \"ecosystem services\" because it is sometimes difficult to deter- mine whether a benefit provided by an ecosystem is a \"good\" or a \"ser-vice.\" Also, when people refer to \"ecosystem goods and services,\" cultural values and other intangible benefits are sometimes forgotten. Ecosystem services have been categorized in a number of different ways, including by: \u0084functional groupings, such as regulation, carrier, habitat, production, and information services (Lobo 2001; de Groot et al. 2002); \u0084organizational groupings, such as services that are associated with cer-tain species, that regulate some exogenous input, or that are related tothe organization of biotic entities (Norberg 1999); and \u0084descriptive groupings, such as renewable resource goods, nonrenewableresource goods, physical structure services, biotic services, biogeochemi-cal services, information services, and social and cultural services(Moberg and Folke 1999). For operational purposes, we will classify ecosystem services along func- tional lines within the MA, using categories of provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services. (See Figure 2.1.) We recognize that some of the categories overlap. Provisioning Services These are the products obtained from ecosystems, including: \u0084Food and fiber. This includes the vast range of food products derived from plants, animals, and microbes, as well as materials such as wood,jute, hemp, silk, and many other products derived from ecosystems. \u0084Fuel. Wood, dung, and other biological materials serve as sources of energy. MA_CF-49-70.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:19 AM 56Ecosystems and Their Services 57 \u0084Genetic resources. This includes the genes and genetic information used for animal and plant breeding and biotechnology. \u0084Biochemicals, natural medicines, and pharmaceuticals. Many medicines, biocides, food additives such as alginates, and biological materials arederived from ecosystems. \u0084Ornamental resources. Animal products, such as skins and shells, and flowers are used as ornaments, although the value of these resources isoften culturally determined. This is an example of linkages betweenthe categories of ecosystem services. \u0084Fresh water. Fresh water is another example of linkages between catego- ries\u2014in this case, between provisioning and regulating services. Regulating Services These are the benefits obtained from the regulation of ecosystem processes, including: \u0084Air quality maintenance. Ecosystems both contribute chemicals to and extract chemicals from the atmosphere, influencing many aspects of air quality.FIGURE 2.1 Ecosystem Services Ecosystem services are the benefits people obtain from ecosystems. These include provi- sioning, regulating, and cultural services that directly affect people and supporting services needed to maintain the other services. MA_CF-49-70.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 5758 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment \u0084Climate regulation. Ecosystems influence climate both locally and glo- bally. For example, at a local scale, changes in land cover can affectboth temperature and precipitation. At the global scale, ecosystems playan important role in climate by either sequestering or emitting green-house gases. \u0084Water regulation. The timing and magnitude of runoff, flooding, and aquifer recharge can be strongly influenced by changes in land cover,including, in particular, alterations that change the water storage po-tential of the system, such as the conversion of wetlands or the replace-ment of forests with croplands or croplands with urban areas. \u0084Erosion control. Vegetative cover plays an important role in soil reten- tion and the prevention of landslides. \u0084Water purification and waste treatment. Ecosystems can be a source of impurities in fresh water but also can help to filter out and decomposeorganic wastes introduced into inland waters and coastal and marineecosystems. \u0084Regulation of human diseases. Changes in ecosystems can directly change the abundance of human pathogens, such as cholera, and can alter theabundance of disease vectors, such as mosquitoes. \u0084Biological control. Ecosystem changes affect the prevalence of crop and livestock pests and diseases. \u0084Pollination. Ecosystem changes affect the distribution, abundance, and effectiveness of pollinators. \u0084Storm protection. The presence of coastal ecosystems such as mangroves and coral reefs can dramatically reduce the damage caused by hurri-canes or large waves. Cultural Services These are the nonmaterial benefits people obtain from ecosystems through spiritual enrichment, cognitive development, reflection, recreation, and aesthetic experiences, including: \u0084Cultural diversity. The diversity of ecosystems is one factor influencing the diversity of cultures. \u0084Spiritual and religious values. Many religions attach spiritual and reli- gious values to ecosystems or their components. \u0084Knowledge systems (traditional and formal). Ecosystems influence the types of knowledge systems developed by different cultures. MA_CF-49-70.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 58Ecosystems and Their Services 59 \u0084Educational values. Ecosystems and their components and processes pro- vide the basis for both formal and informal education in many societies. \u0084Inspiration. Ecosystems provide a rich source of inspiration for art, folk- lore, national symbols, architecture, and advertising. \u0084Aesthetic values. Many people find beauty or aesthetic value in various aspects of ecosystems, as reflected in the support for parks, \"scenic drives,\"and the selection of housing locations. \u0084Social relations. Ecosystems influence the types of social relations that are established in particular cultures. Fishing societies, for example, dif-fer in many respects in their social relations from nomadic herding oragricultural societies. \u0084Sense of place. Many people value the \"sense of place\" that is associated with recognized features of their environment, including aspects of theecosystem. \u0084Cultural heritage values. Many societies place high value on the mainte- nance of either historically important landscapes (\"cultural landscapes\")or culturally significant species. \u0084Recreation and ecotourism. People often choose where to spend their leisure time based in part on the characteristics of the natural or culti- vated landscapes in a particular area. Cultural services are tightly bound to human values and behavior, as well as to human institutions and patterns of social, economic, and politi- cal organization. Thus perceptions of cultural services are more likely todiffer among individuals and communities than, say, perceptions of the importance of food production. The issue of valuing ecosystem services is addressed in Chapter 6. Supporting Services Supporting services are those that are necessary for the production of all other ecosystem services. They differ from provisioning, regulating, and cultural services in that their impacts on people are either indirect or oc-cur over a very long time, whereas changes in the other categories have relatively direct and short-term impacts on people. (Some services, like erosion control, can be categorized as both a supporting and a regulatingservice, depending on the time scale and immediacy of their impact on people.) For example, humans do not directly use soil formation services, although changes in this would indirectly affect people through the im-pact on the provisioning service of food production. Similarly, climate MA_CF-49-70.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 5960 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment regulation is categorized as a regulating service since ecosystem changes can have an impact on local or global climate over time scales relevant to human decision-making (decades or centuries), whereas the production of oxygen gas (through photosynthesis) is categorized as a supporting ser-vice since any impacts on the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere would only occur over an extremely long time. Some other examples of supporting services are primary production, production of atmosphericoxygen, soil formation and retention, nutrient cycling, water cycling, and provisioning of habitat. A Multisectoral Approach Every part of Earth produces a bundle of ecosystem services. (See Box 2.3.) Human interventions can increase some services, though often at the expense of other ones. Thus human interventions have dramatically increased food provisioning services through the spread of agricultural tech-nologies, although this has resulted in changes to other services such as water regulation. For this reason, a multisectoral approach is essential to fully evaluate changes in ecosystem services and their impacts on people.The multisectoral approach examines the supply and condition of each ecosystem service as well as the interactions among them. The MA has adopted just such an approach. When assessing ecosystem services, it is often convenient to bound the analysis spatially and temporally with reference to the ecosystem service or services being examined. Thus a river basin is often the most valuableecosystem scale for examining changes in water services, while a particu- lar agroecological zone may be more appropriate for assessing changes in crop production. When looking at interactions among services, the com-bination of services provided by an ecosystem, or the variety of services drawn on by a society, the question of boundaries becomes more complex. Issues of boundaries, scale, and habitat heterogeneity are important andare dealt with in greater detail in Chapter 5. Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Habitat modification, invasion, and many other factors are leading tochanges in biodiversity across many taxa within most ecosystems. Recently, theoretical and empirical work has identified linkages between changes in biodiversity and the way ecosystems function (Schulze and Mooney 1993;Loreau et al. 2002). The MA will address how ecosystem services are af- fected by such linkages. MA_CF-49-70.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 60Ecosystems and Their Services 61 Among the most important factors identified is the degree of func- tional redundancy found within an ecosystem. This indicates the substi- tutability of species within functional groups in an ecosystem such that the impact created by the loss of one or more species is compensated for byBOX 2.3 Analysis of Ecosystem Services Any region of Earth produces a set of services that in turn influences human well- being. It also receives flows of energy, water, organisms, pollutants, and other mate- rials from adjacent regions and releases similar materials into those regions. Various strategies and interventions influence the quantity and quality of the services pro-vided. An ecosystem is typically composed of a number of different regions, such as forest, agriculture, and urban areas, each of which produces a different bundle ofservices. In an ecosystem assessment, both the production of services from each area and the flows of materials between areas must be assessed. MA_CF-49-70.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 6162 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment others (Naeem 1998). For example, in many ecosystems there are several species that fix nitrogen (known as a functional group of species). If the loss of any one of them is compensated for by the growth of others and there is no overall loss in nitrogen fixation, then there is functional re-dundancy in that ecosystem. Some species make unique or singular contributions to ecosystem func- tioning, however, and therefore their loss is of greater concern (Walker1992). Small changes in the biodiversity of diverse systems may lead to only small changes in the functioning of an ecosystem, including its pro- duction of services, providing no species with unique roles are lost (Joneset al. 1994; Power et al. 1996). But the possibility of significant losses of function increases as more species are lost and as redundancy is reduced\u2014 that is, there is an asymptotic relationship between biodiversity and eco-system functioning. For example, the high diversity of South African fynbos ecosystems ensures steady rates of production because many plant species can compensate for losses by growing when others cannot (Cowling et al.1994). Greater redundancy represents greater insurance that an ecosys- tem will continue to provide both higher and more predictable levels of services (Yachi and Loreau 1999). The MA will seek to evaluate biodiversity and potential declines in biodiversity for different ecosystems under a set of different scenarios for plausible changes in driving forces. This work will extend previous studiesthat developed scenarios for biodiversity change (Sala et al. 2000). For provisioning and supporting services, the MA will identify which ecosys- tem functions are associated with these services and link their response todeclining biodiversity, using the fundamental asymptotic relationship be- tween biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Both magnitudes and sta- bility responses to biodiversity loss can be considered using this funda-mental relationship. Ecosystem Condition and Sustainable Use People seek multiple and different services from ecosystems and thusperceive the condition of an ecosystem in relation to its ability to pro- vide the services desired. The ability of ecosystems to deliver particular services can be assessed separately with various methods and measures.An adequate assessment of the condition of ecosystems, the provision of services, and their implications for human well-being (see Chapter 3) requires an integrated approach. With such an assessment in hand, adecision process (see Chapter 8) can then determine which set of ser- MA_CF-49-70.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 62Ecosystems and Their Services 63 vices are valued most highly (see Chapter 6) and can manage the system in a sustainable way. In a narrow sense, the sustainability of the production of a particular ecosystem service can refer simply to whether the biological potential ofthe ecosystem to sustain the yield of that service (such as food produc- tion) is being maintained. Thus a fish provision service is sustainable if the surplus but not the resource base is harvested, and if the fish's habitatis not degraded by human activities. In the MA, we use the term \"sus- tained yield management\" to refer to the management and yield of an individual resource or ecosystem service. More generally, however, sustainability is used in the context of \"sus- tainable development\" to refer to a pattern of development that meets current needs without diminishing prospects for future generations. Weuse sustainability, and sustainable management, to refer to this goal of en- suring that a wide range of services from a particular ecosystem is sustained. The MA will consider criteria and methods to provide an integrated approach to ecosystem assessment. The condition and sustainability of each category of ecosystem services is evaluated in somewhat different ways, al- though in general a full assessment of any service requires considerations ofstocks, flows, and resilience. Condition of Provisioning Services The flows of provisioning services do not accurately reflect their condi- tion, since a given flow may or may not be sustainable over the long term.The flow is typically measured in terms of biophysical production, such as kilograms of maize per hectare or tons of tuna landings. The provisioning of ecological goods such as food, fuelwood, or fiber, depends both on theflow and the \"stock\" of the good, just as is the case with manufactured goods. (In economics, \"stock\" refers to the total merchandise kept on hand by a merchant; in this section, we use \"stock\" in its economic sense toshow how considerations of ecosystem goods can be incorporated into the economic framework of stocks and flows.) The quantity of goods sold by a manufacturer (the flow), for example, is an incomplete measure of a factory'sproductivity, since it could come from either the production of new goods or the depletion of built-up stocks. Indeed, production of biological re- sources has often been maintained in the short term at a higher rate thanits sustainable yield. In the long term, the production of overharvested resources will fall. Marine fisheries provide examples of an ecosystem service being de- graded even while output has been temporarily maintained or increased MA_CF-49-70.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 6364 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment by more intensive harvesting. Numerous fisheries around the world have been overharvested, exhibiting a general pattern of rapid growth in land- ings (production) followed by the eventual collapse of the fishery. (See Box 2.4.) Similar patterns can be found with virtually all other provision-ing services. Agricultural production, for example, can be maintained through the addition of fertilizers and through new crop varieties even while the pro-ductive potential of the ecosystem is degraded through soil erosion. Some 40 percent of agricultural land has been strongly or very strongly degraded in the past 50 years by erosion, salinization, compaction, nutrient deple-tion, biological degradation, or pollution even while overall global food production has increased (WRI et al. 2000). So long as manufactured capital can compensate for losses of the natural capital of the ecosystem, agricul-tural production can be maintained. In this case, however, manufactured and natural capital are not perfectly substitutable, and once a critical level of soil degradation is reached, agricultural output will decline. A completeaccounting of the condition of food production would reveal that it has been degraded because the underlying capability of the ecosystem to main- tain production has been degraded. Historically, it has not been common for environmental or resource assessments to include measures of the productive potential of biological resources when monitoring the condition of the resource. Thus althoughall countries have considerable information on the production of grain, fisheries, and timber, relatively little is known about the actual condition of these services since the productive potential of the resource has rarelybeen evaluated. The Pilot Analysis of Global Ecosystems, which was pre- pared by the World Resources Institute and the International Food Policy Research Institute to assist in the MA design, attempted to provide a morecomplete assessment of the condition of ecosystem services along these lines (Matthews et al. 2000; Revenga et al. 2000; White et al. 2000; Wood et al. 2000). Condition of Regulating, Cultural, and Supporting Services In the case of regulating services, as opposed to provisioning services, the level of \"production\" is generally not relevant. Instead the condition of the service depends more on whether the ecosystem's capability to regu-late a particular service has been enhanced or diminished. Thus if forest clearance in a region has resulted in decreased precipitation and this has had harmful consequences for people, the condition of that regulatory ser-vice has been degraded. MA_CF-49-70.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 64Ecosystems and Their Services 65 BOX 2.4 Collapse of the Atlantic Cod Fishery The Atlantic cod stocks off the east coast of Newfoundland collapsed in 1992, forcing the closure of the fishery after hundreds of years of exploitation. Until the late 1950s, the fishery was exploited by migratory seasonal fleets and resident in- shore small-scale fishers. From the late 1950s, offshore bottom trawlers began ex-ploiting the deeper part of the stock, leading to a large catch increase and a strong decline in the underlying biomass. Internationally agreed quotas in the early 1970s and, following the declaration by Canada of an Exclusive Fishing Zone in 1977,national quota systems ultimately failed to arrest and reverse the decline. Two factors that contributed to the collapse of the cod stock were the shift to heavy fishing offshore and the use of fishery assessment methods that relied toomuch on scientific sampling and models based on the relatively limited time series and geographical coverage of the offshore part of the fish stocks. Traditional inshore fishers, whose landings account for one third to one half of the total, had noticedthe decline in landings even before the mid-1980s, ahead of the scientists involved in fisheries assessment work but these observations could not be used in stock as- sessments because of technical difficulties in converting the catches into a suitableform. Finlayson (1994) noted that \"science will confer the status of 'valid' only on very specific forms of data presented in a very specialized format.\" Northern Cod Off Newfoundland, Canada (NAFO area 2J3KL) Source: Myers et al. 1995. The evaluation of the condition of cultural services is more difficult. Some cultural services are linked to a provisioning service (such as recre-ational fishing or hunting) that can serve as a proxy measure of the cul- tural service. But in most cases no such proxy exists. Moreover, unlike MA_CF-49-70.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 6566 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment provisioning or regulating services, assessing the condition of cultural ser- vices depends heavily on either direct or indirect human use of the service. For example, the condition of a regulating service such as water quality might be high even if humans are not using the clean water pro-duced, but an ecosystem provides cultural services only if there are people who value the cultural heritage associated with it. Information about the condition of cultural services can be obtained by identifying the specific features of the ecosystem that are of cultural, spiritual, or aesthetic significance and then examining trends in those fea- tures. For example, salmon are a totemic or revered species in almost allparts of the world where they are found, and thus the degradation of wild salmon stocks represents degradation of a cultural service provided by the ecosystem. But cultural service information such as this would be difficultto obtain and to quantify: tigers, for instance, remain totemic species even in areas where they have been extinct for decades. Recognizing that the concept of cultural services is relatively new, the MA will explore meth-ods for evaluating the condition and value of these services. Supporting services maintain the conditions for life on Earth but may affect people only indirectly (by supporting the production of another ser-vice, as soil formation supports food production) or over very long time periods (such as the role of ecosystems in producing oxygen). Because the link to human benefits is indirect, as opposed to the other ecosystem ser-vices just discussed, a normative scale for assessing the condition of a ser- vice is not always practical. For example, primary production is a funda- mental supporting service, since life requires the production of organiccompounds. But if global primary production were to increase by 5 per- cent over the next century, it would be difficult to categorize the change as an enhancement or degradation of the service, though it certainly wouldbe a significant change. In such cases the MA will report on the current biophysical state (production, flux, and stocks) of the supporting service. Variability, Resilience, and Thresholds in Services Whenever possible, individuals and governments generally invest in vari- ous types of insurance that can buffer human welfare against natural vari- ability. Such investments may be as basic as establishing limited stores of food, medicine, and potable water for disaster relief to more elaborate in-vestments such as building dams, levies, and canals to guard against 100- year floods. How, when, and where to invest in such insurance requires assessing not just mean levels of stocks and flows of ecosystem services butalso their dynamics or, more specifically, their variability and stability. MA_CF-49-70.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 66Ecosystems and Their Services 67 Three characteristics of ecosystem services are important in such an assessment: ecosystem variability, resilience, and thresholds. (See Box 2.5.) There are many other properties of stability in dynamic systems (such as resistance, sensitivity, persistence, reliability, predictability, and so forth),but the MA will limit its focus to these three important and well-studied stability properties. Variability in ecosystem services consists of changes in stocks or flows over time due to stochastic, intrinsic, and extrinsic factors, all of which must be disentangled to understand system behavior properly. Stochastic variability is due to random or uncontrolled factors creating variabilitythat is often considered background or \"white\" noise in system behavior. BOX 2.5 Dynamics and Stability in Ecosystem Services This figure illustrates the level of provisioning of an ecosystem service that has been perturbed twice. Hypothetically, such a service exhibits stochastic (random or un- controlled) and inherent variability (fluctuations above and below the two hori-zontal lines, which represent different system states). The system recovers after the first perturbation, with its resilience being measured by the duration of the recovery phase or return time to its first state. Note that crossing the threshold of the secondstate does not cause a shift when in the first state. The second perturbation causes the service to cross the second threshold, which leads to a regime shift or cata- strophic change to an alternative stable state. The long dashed lines illustrate twothresholds. Only when a system crosses a threshold does it switch to an alternate state. MA_CF-49-70.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 6768 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment In contrast, intrinsic (inherent) variability is due to the structural proper- ties of an ecosystem, such as oscillations in systems where predation or disease regulate the number of animals. Examples of extrinsic variability, due to forces outside the system, include seasonality in temperate systemsand longer-term climate systems such as El Ni\u00f1o-La Ni\u00f1a cycles. Resilience is most often considered a measure of the ability of a system to return to its original state after a perturbation\u2014a deviation in condi-tions that is outside the range experienced over a decade or more, such as a large-scale fire or an unusually severe drought. When the duration of the recovery phase is short in comparison to other systems, the system is con-sidered to be more resilient than the others. Thresholds or breakpoints in ecosystems represent dramatic, usually sudden (less than a decade) deviations from average system behavior. Suchdramatic shifts\u2014also known as regime shifts, catastrophic change, or en- tering alternative stable states\u2014are often primed by a steady change in internal or external conditions that increases a system's susceptibility tobeing triggered to enter an alternative state (Scheffer et al. 2001; Carpen- ter 2003). For example, on a global scale, small, steady increases in global warming may lead to a sudden reorganization of Earth's ocean circulationpatterns (Broecker 1997). On a local scale, the increase in grazing animals by ranchers or herders may be responsible for shifts in steppe (grass- dominated) to tundra (moss-dominated) ecosystems (Zimov et al. 1995). While management goals are often conceived in terms of stocks and flows, reducing system variability and improving predictability are often key parts of management strategies. Examples of such interventionsinclude irrigating crops during droughts, using biocides during pest out- breaks, controlled burning to prevent catastrophic fires, and culling herds to prevent a population explosion. Maintaining forests to prevent ero-sion or coral reefs to prevent wave impacts in the face of severe storms are examples of managing ecosystems for their insurance value. Ecosys- tem variability is often addressed through a variety of methods, butmanagement aimed at maintaining ecosystem resilience and avoiding thresholds is sometimes overlooked. In part this is because the mecha- nisms responsible for such behavior are seldom known, so it is difficultto design management that can deal with resilience or thresholds. In addition, there are no accurate assessments of the probability of perturba- tions, and the time frame over which such events occur is too long. The costs to human welfare of ecosystem deviation from its norms of behavior, however, are often severe, thus its inclusion in assessments and management is important. The MA will examine not only magnitudes of MA_CF-49-70.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 68Ecosystems and Their Services 69 ecosystem stocks and flows as they are related to ecosystem goods and services, but also their stability properties. Much of this will be done by extrapolation from expert assessment of paleo records (for instance, cli- mate records derived from ice cores) and historical records (such as long-term fisheries, forestry, or agricultural records) to obtain guidelines on the norms of system variability, resilience, known thresholds, and the envi- ronmental stresses that cause ecosystems to be triggered by perturbationsto enter into alternative states. Ecosystem Health and Other Related Concepts Ecosystem health is a concept that has often been applied to the evalua- tion of ecosystems (Rapport et al. 1995). This has become a subdisciplinein the life sciences, with its own journals and professional organizations, such as the International Society for Ecosystem Health (ISEH) and the Aquatic Ecosystem Health and Management Society. The term is usedsometimes to mean the links between ecosystems and human health. For example, the mission of ISEH is to \"encourage the understanding of the critical linkages between human activity, ecological change and humanhealth\" (Rapport et al. 1999:83). It is also used to refer to the health of the ecosystem itself: \"an ecological system is healthy...if it is stable and sus- tainable\u2014that is, if it is active and maintains its organization and au-tonomy over time and is resilient to stress\" (Costanza et al. 1992:9). This concept has generated debate and alternative approaches within the scientific literature (e.g., Reid 1996; de Leo and Levin 1997). Onemethod measures health as a departure from some preferred (often \"natu- ral\") state. Another, which is consistent with the approach used in the MA to examine the condition of ecosystem services, relates health to the abil-ity of an ecosystem within its surrounding landscape to continue to provide a particular set of services. This considers whether the ecosystem and its external inputs (such as energy or fertilizer) are sustainable in the longterm as well as whether the ecosystem can withstand or recover from per- turbations (resistance and resilience, respectively) and similar issues. The concept of ecosystem health is important both within the research community and as a means of communicating information about ecosys- tems to the general public. Although the MA has not adopted ecosystem health as its primary organizational framework, the concept could be use-fully applied within an assessment that used the MA framework. Several other concepts will also inform the MA without being adopted as organizational frameworks. For instance, ecosystem integrity has beendefined as \"the maintenance of the community structure and function MA_CF-49-70.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:20 AM 6970 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment characteristic of a particular locale or deemed satisfactory to society\" (Cairns 1977:56) or \"the capability of supporting and maintaining a balanced, in- tegrated, adaptive community of organisms having species composition, diversity, and functional organization comparable to that of natural habi-tats of the region\" (Karr and Dudley 1981:171). Another example is the \"ecological footprint,\" which expresses the impact of human activity on ecosystems in terms of areas required to provide the services used by anindividual or community. Substitution of Services Substitutes are available for some ecosystem services, although often the cost of a technological substitution will be high and it may not replace allthe services lost. For example, water treatment plants can now substitute for ecosystems in providing clean drinking water, although this may be expen- sive and will not overcome the impacts of water pollution on other compo-nents of the ecosystem and the services they provide. Another outcome of substitution is that often the individuals gaining the benefits are not those who originally benefited from the ecosystem services. For example, localcoastal fish production can be replaced by shrimp aquaculture in tropical regions, but the individuals making a living from capture fisheries are not those who would profit from the new shrimp aquaculture facilities. Therefore, a full assessment of ecosystems and their services must consider: \u0084information on the cost of a substitute, \u0084the opportunity cost of maintaining the service, \u0084cross-service costs and impacts, and \u0084the distributional impacts of any substitution. MA_CF-49-70.pmd 7/9/2003, and Human Well-being EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \u0084Human well-being has several key components: the basic material needs for a good life, freedom and choice, health, good social relations, and personal se-curity. Well-being exists on a continuum with poverty, which has definedas \"pronounced deprivation in well-being.\" \u0084How well-being and ill-being, or poverty, are expressed and experienced iscontext- and situation-dependent, reflecting local social and personal factorssuch as geography, ecology, age, gender, and culture. These concepts are com-plex and value-laden. \u0084Ecosystems are essential for human well-being through their provisioning,regulating, cultural, and supporting services. Evidence in recent decades ofescalating human impacts on ecological systems worldwide raises concernsabout the consequences of ecosystem changes for human well-being. \u0084Human well-being can be enhanced through sustainable human interactionwith ecosystems with the support of appropriate instruments, institutions, or-ganizations, and technology. Creation of these through participation and trans-parency may contribute to people's freedoms and choices and to increasedeconomic, social, and ecological security. \u0084Some believe that the problems from the depletion and degradation of eco-logical capital can be largely overcome by the substitution of physical andhuman capital. Others believe that there are more significant limits to suchsubstitutions. The scope for substitutions varies by socioeconomic status. \u0084We identify direct and indirect pathways between ecosystem change and hu-man well-being, whether it be positive or negative. Indirect effects are charac-terized by more complex webs of causation, involving social, economic, andpolitical threads. Threshold points exist, beyond which rapid changes to hu-man well-being can occur. \u0084Indigent, poorly resourced, and otherwise disadvantaged communities aregenerally the most vulnerable to adverse ecosystem change. Spirals, bothpositive and negative, can occur for any population, but the poor are morevulnerable. 71 MA_CF-71-84.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:19 AM 7172 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment \u0084Functioning institutions are vital to enable equitable access to ecosystem ser- vices. Institutions sometimes fail or remain undeveloped because of powerfulindividuals or groups. Bodies that mediate the distribution of goods and ser-vices may also be appropriated for the benefit of powerful minorities. \u0084For poor people, the greatest gains in well-being will occur through more eq-uitable and secure access to ecosystem services. In the long run, the rich cancontribute greatly to human well-being by reducing their substantial impactson ecosystems and by facilitating greater access to ecosystem services by thepoor. \u0084We argue ecological security warrants recognition as a sixth freedom of equalweight with participative freedom, economic facilities, social opportunities,transparency guarantees, and protective security. Introduction As noted in earlier chapters, the impacts of human activities on ecosys- tems have increased rapidly in the last few decades. While the majority of these can be considered beneficial to human well-being, there is growingevidence of adverse effects. Clear analysis of these undesirable impacts and their consequences for people has been difficult because of the numer- ous other causes of ecosystem change that operate and interact at differentsocial, geographical, and temporal scales. For some people, especially those buffered by relative affluence, the problem is scarcely visible\u2014or at least accorded low priority. Yet millions of others experience every day the det-rimental consequences of ecosystem changes. Consideration of purely local and overt environmental deficiencies, such as visible pollution, is no longer a sufficient framework to assess therelationship between the environment and human well-being. The re- cently evident larger-scale changes to the world's ecosystems must also be looked at closely (McMichael 2001). The dependence of humans on ecosystem services reflects directly the profound co-evolutionary processes that underlie the origins of Earth's bio- sphere. The biosphere and its ecosystems provide life support to all spe-cies, as described in Chapter 2. Further, the biosphere is itself the product of life on Earth. The composition of the atmosphere and soil, the cycling of nutrients through waterways, and many other ecological assets are allthe result of living processes\u2014and all are maintained and replenished by living ecosystems. The effects of adverse ecosystem changes on human well-being can be classed as direct and indirect. Direct effects occur with some immediacy, MA_CF-71-84.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:19 AM 72Ecosystems and Human Well-being 73 through locally identifiable biological or ecological pathways. For example, impairment of the water-cleansing capacity of wetlands may adversely af- fect those who drink that water. Building dams can increase mosquito- breeding and thus the transmission of malaria. The deforestation of hill-sides can expose downstream communities to the hazards of flooding. Indirect effects take a toll on well-being through more complex webs of causation, including through social, economic, and political routes. Somemay take decades to have an impact. For example, where farmlands under irrigation become saline, crop yields are reduced; this in turn may affect human nutritional security, child growth and development, and suscepti-bility to infectious diseases. Beyond threshold points, limited or degraded supplies of fresh water may exacerbate political tensions, impair local eco- nomic activity (and livelihoods)\u2014including industry\u2014and reduce aes-thetic amenity. These dynamic, interacting processes jeopardize various aspects of human well-being. The impacts of adverse ecosystem change do not fall evenly on human populations. Indigent, poorly resourced, and otherwise disadvantaged com- munities are generally the most vulnerable. Further, many poor rural popu- lations rely disproportionately on the integrity and functions of local eco-systems and are likely to lack the means to import ecosystem services. Impoverishment as a result of adverse ecosystem change may sometimes lead to a downwards spiral for such people. In all instances, the ability toachieve well-being is reduced by the diminished availability of ecosystem services. Key Components of Human Well-being There have been many formulations and definitions of human well-being(Alkire 2002). Most commentators would agree that it includes basic material needs for a good life, the experience of freedom, health, personalsecurity, and good social relations. Together, these provide the conditions for physical, social, psychological, and spiritual fulfillment. A distinction is sometimes made between the determinants of or means to well-being and its constituents\u2014that is, well-being as an end (Dasgupta 2001). In other words, well-being is experiential, what people value being and doing. The determinants are sometimes expressed as commodity in-puts, many of which are provided by ecosystem services. They include food, fiber, fuel, clean water, materials for shelter, marketed crops, live- stock, forest products, and minerals. Enabling physical, environmental,and social conditions and access\u2014for example, to resources and 7/9/2003, 6:19 AM 7374 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment are also relevant as determinants of or means to well-being. Viewed within this frame, some key elements of well-being can be both determinants and constituents. For example, education and health can be both ends in them- selves and the means to experience well-being. There is widespread agreement that well-being and poverty are the two extremes of a multidimensional continuum. In fact, the World Devel- opment Report 2000/01 defined poverty as \"the pronounced deprivation of well-being\" (World Bank 2001). How well-being and ill-being, or poverty, are expressed and experienced is context- and situation-dependent, reflecting local social and personalfactors such as geography, ecology, age, gender, and culture (Prescott-Allen 2001). Although these concepts are recognized as complex and value-laden, some elements are nevertheless widespread\u2014if not universal. This was evi-dent in the \"voices of the poor\" research (Narayan et al. 1999; 2000), in which poor people in 23 countries were asked to reflect, analyze, and ex- press their ideas of the bad and the good life. The respondents stressedmany aspects, including the importance of secure and adequate livelihoods, cultural and spiritual activities, and the ability to provide for their chil- dren. Repeatedly, they indicated five linked components (see Figure 3.1): \u0084the necessary material for a good life (including secure and adequate livelihoods, income and assets, enough food at all times, shelter, furni-ture, clothing, and access to goods); \u0084health (including being strong, feeling well, and having a healthy physi-cal environment); \u0084good social relations (including social cohesion, mutual respect, good gender and family relations, and the ability to help others and provide for children); \u0084security (including secure access to natural and other resources, safetyof person and possessions, and living in a predictable and controllable environment with security from natural and human-made disasters); and \u0084freedom and choice (including having control over what happens andbeing able to achieve what a person values doing or being). These five dimensions reinforce each other, whether positively or nega- tively. A change in one often brings about changes in the others. The shaded space in Figure 3.1 represents the experience of living and being\u2014 including stress, pain, and anxiety in the bad life and peace of mind andspiritual experience in the good life. MA_CF-71-84.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:19 AM 74Ecosystems and Human Well-being 75 In this multidimensional formulation, there are negative and positive webs of interactions. On the side of ill-being and the bad life, the double- headed arrows represent negative directions of causality: for example, poor people are vulnerable to sickness, which in turn makes them poorer; badsocial relations make people vulnerable to shocks, which in turn deepensmaterial poverty and so on; and all of these contribute to powerlessness. On the side of well-being and the good life, having materially enough facilitates physical strength, enabling a better livelihood, while good so-cial relations can provide security against stresses and shocks. In turn, se- curity is likely to increase material well-being and so on. And all of these enhance freedom of choice and action. Overall, development can thus be seen as the enhancement of well- being. It entails transitions for those who are deprived\u2014from conditions of ill-being or the \"bad life\" to well-being or the \"good life.\" One condition for personal well-being is the capability to adapt and achieve that which individuals value doing and being in situations of dy- namic change. At the social level this may contribute to conflicts, necessi-tating trade-offs between the well-being of different individuals and groups. Trade-offs may occur when, for example, material capital is accumulated at a cost of environmental security or cultural or spiritual values. This also hasa temporal dimension concerning the well-being of others in the future. Addressing these issues leads into the sphere of values. This is a realm for decision-makers. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) doesnot take a position, but we note that one proposed approach to these con-FIGURE 3.1 The Main Dimensions of Well-being and its Obverse, MA_CF-71-84.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:19 AM Framework for Assessment flicts and trade-offs is a framework that combines concepts of equity, sustainability, livelihood, capability, and ecosystem stewardship. These are related to a value-based notion of well-being in which socially and eco- logically responsible behavior plays a part (Chambers 1997a). This in turnrelates to the negative and positive effects of individuals' lives, actions, and non-actions on ecosystems and on other people\u2014both now and in the future. Negative effects manifest especially through the unsustainableconsumption of resources, the degradation of ecosystems, and the many impacts of the behaviors of people who are richer and more powerful on those who are poorer and weaker . Positive effects include sustainable rela- tionships between people and ecosystems, as well as the provision and enhancement of present and future livelihoods, capabilities, and human well-being. Linkages between Ecosystem Services and Human Well-being These formulations recognize that the relationship of ecosystem condi-tions and the flow of services to the well-being of groups of people as wellas individuals is diverse and complex. Further, it changes over time. Many ecosystem changes are planned, but many are inadvertent consequences of other human activities. Human interventions in nature have had unex-pected and surprising consequences, some of which have harmed and fur- ther impoverished those who are disadvantaged. Equitable and sustain- able well-being depends heavily on links with ecosystem services and onwho gains and who loses over time from their use. As noted in Chapter 2, the MA has identified four major categories of ecosystem services that bear directly on human well-being: provisioning, regulating, cultural, andsupporting services. The provisioning function of ecosystems supplies goods and other ser- vices that sustain various aspects of human well-being. By the same token,shortages of food, fiber, and other products have adverse effects on human well-being, via both direct and indirect pathways. Adverse impacts on livelihoods are of particular importance. In both social and environmen-tal contexts, livelihood sustainability has three aspects: \u0084a livelihood is sustainable \"when it can cope with and recover from stresses and shocks and maintain or enhance its capabilities and assetsboth now and in the future\" (DFID 1999); \u0084a livelihood is sustainable in a social context when it enhances or doesnot diminish the livelihoods of others; and MA_CF-71-84.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:19 AM 76Ecosystems and Human Well-being 77 \u0084a livelihood is sustainable when it does not deplete or disrupt ecosys- tems to the prejudice of the livelihoods and well-being of others now orin the future. Biodiversity is fundamental to many ecosystem services. For example, it provides sustainability and resilience vital for the livelihoods and cop-ing strategies of many people, especially the rural poor. They often obtain ecosystem services, and thereby reduce their vulnerability, through diverse and complex mixes of activities over the seasons. For them, biodiversityhas a stabilizing and buffering function. It provides multiple sources of ecosystem services, as well as fallback options for food and other resources when times are bad (Davies 1996; of ecosystems also affect human well-being in multiple ways. These include the purification of air, fresh water, reducedflooding or drought, stabilization of local and regional climate, and checks and balances that control the range and transmission of certain diseases, including some that are vector-borne. Without these regulatory functions,the varied populations of human and animal life are inconceivable. Thus changes to an ecosystem's regulatory function may have consequences for human health and other components of well-being. Ecosystems also have many consequences for human well-being through the cultural services they provide\u2014through, for example, totemic species, sacred groves, trees, scenic landscapes, geological formations, or rivers andlakes. These attributes and functions of ecosystems influence the aesthetic, recreational, educational, cultural, and spiritual aspects of human experi- ence. Many changes to these ecosystems, through processes of disruption,contamination, depletion, and extinction, therefore have negative im- pacts on cultural life and human experience. Supporting services are essential for sustaining each of the other three ecosystem services. Thus the link between supporting services and human well-being occurs indirectly. The diverse links between ecosystem services and the determinants and constituents of human well-being are illustrated in Figure 3.2. The spatial and temporal forms of these links, as well as their complexity, vary greatly. Some relationships are immediate; others are lagged. For instance,impairment of food production causes hunger today and malnutrition be- fore long, bringing lassitude, impaired ability to concentrate and learn, and increased vulnerability to infectious diseases. Examples of longer time-lags include the clearing of mangroves, and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment FIGURE 3.2 Ecosystem Services and Their Links to Human Well-being Ecosystem services are the benefits people obtain from ecosystems. These include provi- sioning, regulating, and cultural services, which directly affect people, and supporting services needed to maintain the other services. Changes in these services affect human well-being through impacts on security, the necessary material for a good life, health, andsocial and cultural relations. These constituents of well-being are in turn influenced by and have an influence on the freedoms and choices available to people. (See also Duraiappah 2002.) MA_CF-71-84.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:19 AM 78Ecosystems and Human Well-being 79 of fish stocks (Naylor et al. 2000), salinization created by badly managed shrimp aquaculture, depletion of groundwater for irrigation, and the im- pact of introduced species. Some larger-scale environmental stresses heighten tensions, leading to possible conflict, and threaten well-being by causing health problems (Homer-Dixon 1994). For example, Ethiopia and the Sudan, which are both upstream of Egypt, increasingly need the Nile's water for their owncrops. Worldwide, approximately 40 percent of the world's population, living in 80 countries, now faces some level of water shortage (Gleick 2000). The construction of large dams, though of benefit through irriga-tion and power generation, can create new stresses\u2014particularly in devel- oping countries\u2014by leading to increased levels of schistosomiasis (Fenwick et al. 1981) or displacing people through flooding (Roy 1999; World Com-mission on Dams 2000). The dual challenge for society is thus to retain and, indeed, sustain a sufficient level of ecosystem services in a way that contributes to the en-hancement of human well-being and the reduction of poverty. Explicit recognition of these links (see Box 3.1) and of substitutability among the various forms of capital will help policy-makers and other stakeholders tomake informed decisions. Those, in turn, may produce the most efficient and equitable outcome. Substitutability and Well-being Ecosystem services can be conceptualized as flows parallel to those fromphysical and human capital. Some of these services can also be partially replaced by using physical capital. For instance, limited amounts of cleanair and water can be obtained by air-conditioning a space or by using wa- ter filters. In other words, partial substitutability exists for at least some ecosystem services. Some commentators believe that the problems fromthe depletion and degradation of ecological capital can be largely over- come by the accumulation of knowledge and of manufactured and human capital. There are limits to substitution possibilities, however, and the scopefor substitutions varies by social, economic, and cultural conditions. In fact, the substitution possibilities open to a community depend criti- cally on economic status. A resource can be a luxury for others even whileit is a necessity for some. Politically, commercial demand can easily out- rank local needs, especially under nondemocratic regimes. If local biodiversity is lost, ecotourists can go somewhere else, where it still exists.International public opinion, not to mention pressure from a country's MA_CF-71-84.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:19 AM 7980 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment elite, is often at best tepid. Local needs are frequently overridden by out- siders' demands (Guard and Masaiganah 1997). When wetlands, forests, and woodlands are converted (for agriculture, for example, or urban development), local communities may suffer. For them, and especially the poorest, there are few substitutes or choices. For privileged others, whose \"ecological footprints\" dwarf those of the poorand weak (Wackernagel and Rees 1995), there are often substitutes\u2014some- thing else, often somewhere else. Issues of common and conflicting inter- ests and of reducing demands can be expected to surface. The questionthat may arise is whether long-term and secure well-being for the world's relatively affluent people will lie in living more lightly on Earth while ensuring a better life and a fairer share of ecosystem services for those whoBOX 3.1 Environment, Population, Poverty, and Well-being: A Complex Relationship The downward spiral that links environment, poverty, health, and well-being is complex. Both poverty and environmental degradation, via independent pathways, jeopardize well-being and health. Some commentators maintain that an approximate inverted U-shaped relation- ship exists between income and environmental degradation. That is, as the average income of a population increases, many forms of environmental degradation ini-tially increase before the availability of wealth, literacy, and regulatory institutions combine to reduce the problem (Grossman and Krueger 1995). The poor, however, derive their sustenance and livelihoods from healthy ecosys- tems such as grasslands, forests, and cropland. Why do they degrade the very assets that are the source of their own present and future incomes? Does their poverty make them barter the future for the present? Studies in the past decade from manyparts of the developing world show that this usually happens when local social insti- tutions that govern the use of \"the commons\" 2001). This may be due to theoperation of a combination of factors, including commercialization, population pres- sure, and bad governance. When appropriate sets of property rights are put in force, the process can be contained. Most of the documented examples of an inverted U-shaped relationship refer to local pollution such as river or air pollution. In contrast, the indices for many of today's larger-scale environmental problems (such as greenhouse gas emissions andthe release of activated nitrogen) display a continuous increase (Vitousek et al. 1997; Butler 2000). These are problems of the \"global commons\" (Dasgupta 1996; Buck 1998) for which there is not yet clear feedback in terms of perceived conse-quences that influence the richer populations. Finding appropriate interventions for them will require the agency of global institutions. MA_CF-71-84.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:19 AM 80Ecosystems and Human Well-being 81 are poor and deprived. In any case, there are vital policy questions about how to achieve well-being for all, and especially for those who experience it least. Balancing Priorities: Present Versus Future The relationship between ecosystem change and human well-being hasboth current and future dimensions. The overexploitation of ecosystems may temporarily increase material well-being and alleviate poverty, yet itmay prove unsustainable. That is, to solve today's pressing problems, soci- ety is often tempted to deplete tomorrow's ecological resource base. This can jeopardize future well-being and, in some cases, even survival. The World Commission on Environment and Development first pro- posed a now widely accepted definition of sustainable development as \"development that meets the needs of the present without compromis-ing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\" (WCED 1987:43). That is, each generation should bequeath to its successor at least as large a productive base as it inherited. Thus the concept of sus-tainable development incorporates not only intragenerational but also intergenerational equity. In practice, can the present generation be expected to pursue sus- tainable development policies? After all, parents care about both the current and future well-being of their children. Since their children's well-being will depend upon the well-being of their grandchildren\u2014andthat of their grandchildren will in turn depend upon their great- grandchildren's, and so on\u2014parents will tend to take at least some ac- count of the interests of their distant descendants, even if they are di-rectly interested only in their children. Such individual concerns find a reflection in societal preferences only when prevailing property rights and other institutional structures take theminto account. This is rarely the case. Instead, bad or weakly functioning institutions not only permit adverse consequences for human well-being from past and present actions but also hold no one to account. Often, thedamage to ecosystems is the result of elite and powerful groups, both do- mestic and international, extracting short-term values for quick gains, thereby overriding the often longer-term interest of individuals and localcommunities (Jepson et al. 2001). If property rights to local ecosystems are ill defined or inadequately protected, such actions can have long-term adverse effects on ecosystem services that no one is responsible for. MA_CF-71-84.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:19 AM 8182 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment Just as such actions can adversely affect contemporaries, they can have unintended consequences over time. For example, fish farms created by clearing mangroves can benefit economically the company that has cre- ated the farms, but the action will inflict future damage on those whowould otherwise have depended on the mangroves for provisioning, regu- lating, supporting, and cultural services (Gilbert and Janssen 1998; Ong 2002). Institutions and Freedoms Earlier sections demonstrated how many of the constituents or determi-nants of well-being were directly or indirectly provided by ecosystem ser-vices. It has also been shown that ecosystem services are not infinite and are subject to scarcity. Although there are potentials for substitutability with other forms of capital, thresholds exist beyond which substitutes arenot possible. For example, while many pharmaceuticals can be produced synthetically, the therapeutic potential of extinct, undiscovered species can never be developed. Scarcity and the chance to add value provide powerful incentives for individuals or groups to try to gain privileged access and rights-of-use to many ecosystems and their services. They do this by influencing the po-litical, economic, and social institutions that govern their access, man- agement, and informal\u2014mediate the link between ecosys- tem services and the constituents and determinants of human well-being. For example, institutions for community forest management in India havesuccessfully facilitated access to forest products for local communities (Chopra and Dasgupta 2002). In most cases, inequitable distribution of or access to ecosystems and their services occurs when formal or informal institutions break down (Binswager 1989; Jaganathan 1989; Duraiappah 1998). This happens either when institutions do not exist or when they are inefficient or inef-fective. There are many reasons for institutional failure. Commonly, pow- erful individuals or groups prevent the establishment of institutions. Existing bodies that mediate the distribution of goods and services mayalso be appropriated for the benefit of powerful minorities. Agricultural subsidies in western industrial countries are an example of this. Creating, revising, and modifying institutions is a social process. Cer- tain preconditions, or \"freedoms,\" are necessary to ensure that this process MA_CF-71-84.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:19 AM 82Ecosystems and Human Well-being 83 is equitable and fair. These freedoms, by permitting a fair and equitable social process, play a critical role in preventing or mitigating institutional failure. Five freedoms that have been identified are participative freedom, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees, and pro-tective security (Jordan 1996; Sen 1999; Chopra and Duraiappah in press). For example, access by the poor to credit at reasonable interest rates\u2014the provision of an economic facility\u2014has been facilitated by microcreditschemes, such as the Grameen Bank, a formal institution (Yunus 1998). We have, in this chapter, added a sixth freedom to the five just listed\u2014 ecological security. We define this as the minimum level of ecologicalstock (an ecological safety net), defined by respective communities through an open and participatory process, that is required to provide the support- ing services needed to ensure a sustainable flow of provisioning, regulat-ing, and cultural ecosystem services. We stress that ecosystems and their services are not only instrumental for improving well-being, but are also constitutive elements of well-being. For example, microbiologically ad-equate water, needed for good health, may also be valued for aspects such as its purity and ease of access. Contrary to the view that some of these freedoms are luxuries, defer- rable until some level of macroeconomic growth has been achieved, we argue that they are complementary, rather than substitutes. Social, politi- cal, economic, and ecological freedoms are essential if equity, fairness,justice, and choice are to be addressed. In order to take advantage of eco- nomic facilities, for instance, it is essential to have some social opportuni- ties, such as health and education, available (Dr\u00e8ze and Sen 2002). In asimilar fashion, it is necessary to have participative freedom and transpar- ency guarantees if ecological security is to truly benefit local communities. These six freedoms provide the space that allows individuals to define their rights\u2014legal, political, social, ecological\u2014and to create institutions to protect and oversee a fair and equitable distribution of these rights for all members of society. In this manner, individuals, especially the poor, aregiven the ability to make their own choices for self-determination. This process allows them to become agents of change. Conclusion The well-being of present and future human populations depends on eco-logically sustainable and socially equitable ways of living in the world. In determining how to achieve these, value judgments have to be made con-cerning equity and ecosystem stewardship. These are the sphere of MA_CF-71-84.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:19 AM 8384 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment makers. Depending on context, decision-makers are faced with questions of who gains and who loses in rights, access, and the ability to enjoy eco- system services. Toward these ends, and toward the reduction of poverty, an essential step is fuller understanding of the myriad ways in which human activities and well-being are related to ecosystem changes and services. Such under- standings will always be needed to inform and support responsible and far-sighted governance. It is implicit in this chapter that enhancing those understandings will be an essential and permanent part of human endeavor. To achieve sustainable well-being for all will be a perennial challenge.And in the constant flux and interaction of ecosystems and people, no answers can ever be final. MA_CF-71-84.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:19 AM 844Drivers of Change in Ecosystems and Their Services EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \u0084Understanding the factors that cause changes in ecosystems and ecosystem services is essential to the design of interventions that enhance positive andminimize negative impacts. \u0084A driver is any natural or human-induced factor that directly or indirectly causesa change in an ecosystem. A direct driver unequivocally influences ecosystemprocesses and can therefore be identified and measured to differing degreesof accuracy. An indirect driver operates more diffusely, often by altering one ormore direct drivers, and its influence is established by understanding its effecton direct drivers. \u0084Decision-makers influence some drivers and are influenced by other drivers.The first are the endogenous drivers and the latter are the exogenous ones.Conceptually, decisions are made at three organizational levels: by individualsand small groups at the local level who directly alter some part of the ecosys-tem; by public and private decision-makers at municipal, provincial, and na-tional levels; and by public and private decision-makers at the internationallevel. In reality, however, the distinction between these levels is often diffuseand difficult to define. \u0084The degree to which a driver is outside the influence of a decision-makingprocess depends to some extent on the temporal scale. Some factors may beexogenous in the short run but subject to change by a decision-maker overlonger periods. \u0084Local decision-makers can directly influence the choice of technology, changesin land use, and external inputs but have little control over prices and markets,property rights, technology development, or the local climate. National or re-gional decision-makers have more control over many indirect drivers, such asmacroeconomic policy, technology development, property rights, trade barri-ers, prices, and markets. 85 MA_CF-85-106.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:18 AM 8586 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment \u0084The indirect drivers of change are primarily demographic, economic, sociopolitical, scientific and technological, and cultural and religious. The in-teraction of several of these drivers in turn affects the overall level of resourceconsumption and disparities in consumption within and between countries.Clearly these drivers are changing: population and the global economy aregrowing, there are major advances in information technology and biotech-nology, and the world is becoming more interconnected. Changes in thesedrivers are projected to increase the demand for food, fiber, clean water, andenergy, which will in turn affect the direct drivers. The direct drivers are prima-rily physical, chemical, and biological, such as land cover change, climatechange, air and water pollution, irrigation, use of fertilizers, harvesting, and theintroduction of alien invasive species. \u0084Any decision can have consequences external to the decision framework. Theseare called externalities because they are not part of the decision-making cal-culus. Externalities can have positive or negative effects. The effect of an exter-nality is seldom confined to the environs of the decision-maker. External ef-fects extend to other parts of the ecosystem and even to other ecosystems. Itis possible for individually unimportant external effects to have dramatic re-gional and global consequences when many local decision-makers simulta-neously take decisions with similar unintended consequences. \u0084Multiple, interacting drivers cause changes in ecosystem services. There arefunctional interdependencies between and among the indirect and directdrivers of change, and, in turn, changes in ecological services lead to feed-backs on the drivers of changes in ecological services. Synergetic driver com-binations are very common. The many processes of globalization are leadingto new forms of interactions among drivers of changes in ecosystem services. Introduction A broad range of factors lead directly and indirectly to changes in ecosys- tems, ecosystem services, and human well-being. Many ecosystem changes are intended or unintended consequences of human decisions and theensuing actions. The drivers of those changes may be well defined, such as grain prices or local rainfall, but they may also involve more complex and diffuse interactions arising from institutional or cultural influences. Un-derstanding the factors that cause these changes in ecosystems and ecosys- tem services is essential to designing interventions that enhance positive and minimize negative impacts. Here, as in many parts of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA), the first challenge is to find terms that mean the same thing to many different users. The term \"driver,\" for example, is used widely in the eco-logical and other natural sciences but seldom used by economists. And even when the term is used, different meanings exist. The MA defines MA_CF-85-106.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:18 AM 86Drivers of Change in Ecosystems and Their Services 87 driver in the broadest possible sense: any natural or human-induced factor that directly or indirectly causes a change in an ecosystem. The approach adopted here is to distinguish between direct and indi- rect drivers. (See Box 4.1.) A direct driver unequivocally influences eco- system processes and therefore can be identified and measured to differingdegrees of accuracy. Indirect drivers operate more diffusely, from a dis- tance, often by altering one or more direct drivers. An indirect driver can seldom be identified through direction observation of the ecosystem; itsinfluence is established by understanding its effect on a direct driver. A decision-maker can influence certain driving forces (the endogenous drivers) but not others (the exogenous drivers). Endogenous drivers arethus under the direct control of a decision-maker at a certain level, while exogenous drivers are not. The MA explicitly focuses on who controls specific drivers. This helps to explain the role of responses in describing,understanding, and projecting changes in ecosystems, ecosystem services, and human well-being. Consider, for example, the case of wheat production in Europe. A wheat farmer in southern France can vary the amount of nitrogenous fertilizer to apply but has no influence on the price received for the wheat. Policy- makers in the European Union, however, can influence the price of wheatreceived by that farmer by imposing or eliminating wheat trade restric- tions. As the time and space scales expand, more drivers become endog- enous; that is, a different set of decision-makers has influence over theBOX 4.1 Typologies of Drivers Several typologies of drivers were considered for the Millennium Ecosystem Assess- ment conceptual framework\u2014primary versus proximate, anthropogenic versus bio- physical, dependent versus independent, primary versus secondary. The proximate and primary driver terminology, for example, is widely used in the land use changeand climate change literature (e.g., Turner II et al. 1995; IPCC 2002). Proximate and primary drivers are conceptually similar to direct and indirect drivers respec- tively, but tend to be used when analyzing specific spatial processes in which thehuman intent (primary) is linked with actual physical actions (proximate). The explicit cross-scale linkages and inclusion of physical activities of this typology made it too complex, however, for characterizing the drivers in the Millennium Ecosys-tem Assessment conceptual framework. Other typologies have been developed for specific purposes and have their limitations. The distinction between direct and indirect drivers, in contrast, provides an opportunity to include highly diverse typesof drivers and seemed acceptable to the broadest possible community. MA_CF-85-106.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:18 AM 8788 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment drivers. This distinction is especially important in identifying interven- tion points and strategies. Another key point is that any decision can have consequences external to the decision framework. These consequences are called exter-nalities because they are not part of the decision-making calculus. Externalities can have positive or negative effects. For example, a deci- sion to plow a dry field for crop production might result in substantialparticulate matter blowing into a nearby village, with negative health ef- fects. But it is also possible to have positive externalities. A beekeeper might be motivated by the profits to be made from selling honey, for in-stance, but neighboring orchards could produce more apples because of enhanced pollination arising from the presence of the bees. Previous Approaches on the Factors of Change During the late 1960s and early 1970s, debates began about the factorsthat lead humans to have adverse effects on the biophysical environment. A number of \"root\" causes were asserted: religion (White 1967), commonproperty institutions (McCay and Jentoft 1998), and capitalism and colo- nialism (O'Connor 1988). But none of these hypotheses of dominant cause could sustain empirical scrutiny. The IPAT formulation (Impacts = Popu-lation x Affluence x Technology) was an initial attempt to move beyond simple arguments about single causes by acknowledging: \u0084that there are multiple human drivers of environmental change, \u0084that their effects are multiplicative rather than additive, \u0084that increases in one driver can sometimes be mitigated by changes in another driver, and \u0084that assessing the effects of human drivers requires both theory and empirical evidence. For a history of IPAT and related arguments about drivers, see Dietz and Rosa (1994). IPAT continues to be used in discussions of the drivers of environmen- tal change (e.g., Waggoner and Ausubel 2002), and the IPAT accountingframework finds productive use in industrial ecology (Chertow 2001). However, formulations that build on IPAT are emerging. The impact of population growth and affluence on consumption continues to be exam-ined. A variety of studies demonstrate that population size has an effect on impacts but sometimes is less important than other factors (e.g., Palloni MA_CF-85-106.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:18 AM 88Drivers of Change in Their Services 89 1994; Rudel and Roper 1997; York et al. 2003). A substantial literature examines the effects of affluence on environmental impact (reviewed in Stern 1998; Nordstrom and Vaughan 1999), including a number of analy- ses that suggest that such effects depend strongly on context (Roberts andGrimes 1997). Research on drivers deploys the full repertoire of available methodologies, including statistical analyses, case studies, and simulation, and the literature is growing in both size and sophistication. Over the last decade, the approach has been further refined in many assessment models by adding such factors as specific sociopolitical, bio- physical, and cultural drivers. But these top-down approaches to environ-mental change still rely heavily on highly aggregated drivers, the value of which has recently been questioned (e.g., Barbier 2000; Contreras- Hermosilla 2000; Barrett et al. of Sci-ences et al. 2001; Lambin et al. 2001; Myers and Kent 2001; van Beers and de Moor 2001; Young 2002). For example, in a statistical analysis of the causes of deforestation, Geist and Lambin (2002) show that different localand regional drivers play an important role. But perhaps the most impor- tant recent advance in understanding is the elucidation of a broader vari- ety of interacting drivers that become more important in the local context. The individual importance of global drivers cannot be assessed in a simple way. There is no clear hierarchy of drivers that encompasses cause and effect. Individuals and societies try to influence their environmentand fulfill their needs by evaluating expected outcomes. If undesired im- pacts are foreseen, mitigating decisions can be made. This approach is made operational most clearly in the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) scheme that was developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD InterFutures Study Team 1979). Many assessments have followed this approach, at least in part. For example, the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change structured its assessment along these lines\u2014activities > emissions > concentration >climate change > impacts > mitigation and adaptation responses (IPCC 2002)\u2014recognizing that responses in turn alter activities (mitigation) and impacts (adaptation). The conceptual framework is a closed loop and dis-plays different interactions between drivers and components. In the MA, determining trade-offs and synergies between different decisions and other responses will be central. This requires that the assessment examines care-fully the interactions of drivers at specific scale levels and over varying spatial, temporal, and organizational dimensions. MA_CF-85-106.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:18 AM 8990 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment Recent advances in integrated assessment (e.g., Alcamo et al. 1998; Stafford-Smith and Reynolds 2002) and comprehensive analyses of envi- ronmental problems (e.g., Petschel-Held et al. 1999; Ostrom et al. 2002) have shown that analyzing causes of environmental change requires amultiscale and multidimensional assessment of major components of the system and their dynamics and interactions. An appreciation of the feed- backs, synergies, and trade-offs among these components in the past im-proves understanding of current conditions and enhances the ability to project future outcomes and intervention options. Drivers: An Overview In the MA, key elements of drivers that are assessed include: \u0084an explicit recognition of the role of decision-makers at different levels who directly or indirectly affect ecosystems and their services; \u0084identification of drivers that influence these decision-makers; \u0084the specific temporal, spatial, and organizational scale dependencies of these drivers; and \u0084the specific linkages and interactions among drivers. The MA approach assumes that decisions are made at three organiza- tional levels: \u0084by individuals and small groups at the local level (such as fields and forest stands) who directly alter some part of the ecosystem; \u0084by public and private decision-makers at regional levels (the munici- pal, provincial, and national level); and \u0084by international conventions and multilateral agreements that operate at the global level. For global drivers, we recognize that there is no explicit global govern- ing body. The United Nations proceeds, for example, through consensus building between national governments. And in reality, of course, the dis- tinction between these three levels is often diffuse and difficult to assess. Today a fairly consistent, agreed-upon list of global or \"big-picture\" drivers that change ecosystems, ecosystem services, and human well- being has emerged. Many of these are used as inputs to models that projectfuture energy and land use (e.g., Nak\u00edcenov\u00edc et al. 2000). However, many of these models use global aggregates, and distinct local and re- gional patterns in these drivers are not captured. The major global driv- MA_CF-85-106.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:18 AM 90Drivers of Change in Ecosystems and Their Services 91 ing forces used in many assessments, which the MA uses as a basis for analysis, are: and \u0084physical, biological, and chemical drivers. These globally aggregated drivers appear exogenous to decision- makers. Their current condition cannot be influenced effectively. Changes in these drivers are generally slow and are the cumulative effect of manydiverse local and regional decisions. But viewed with a longer perspective, these drivers become subject to the influence of human decisions (that is, become endogenous). For example, today's population can be closely esti-mated and is truly exogenous. Today's decision-makers have no influence over the number of people in the world now. However, national rates of population growth (determined by birth and death rates adjusted for mi-gration) could change substantially because of political decisions\u2014that is, become endogenous\u2014and could influence population half a century hence. The Decision-maker within the Ecosystem The influence of humans over ecosystems is most obvious at the locallevel. People living within an ecosystem undertake myriad activities thatalter its condition and capacity to deliver useful services. We highlight important elements of this interaction in Figure 4.1, which is based on the MA conceptual framework diagram. (See Chapter 1.) In the lower left,the ecosystem is represented by the background rectangle. A typical eco- system has many different decision-makers (farmers, fishers, households, local production communities) with control over some part of the system.We will refer to this unit as an agricultural field in this section for ease of exposition, but it could just as well be a lake, a forest district, or a marine region. The decisions made about the field, and the actions that follow,affect the condition of the ecosystem and the services it provides\u2014both within the field and elsewhere. The decision-making process is complex and multidimensional. The local decision-maker might be motivated by tradition (my family has farmed MA_CF-85-106.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:18 AM 9192 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment this land for centuries), by biophysical factors (this land and climate is the most productive throughout the year to grow flowers for the international market), by economic need (I sell crops at the local market to buy cloth- ing and medicine), or by familial responsibilities (my children need edu-cation for a better future). The actual decision is based on a combination of many different motives and influences\u2014some are observable, while oth- ers are not. It is also important to realize that it is the actions arising from the decision that ultimately drive changes in the ecosystem. It is useful to distinguish here between the resulting physical drivers of ecosystem change(direct drivers) and the signals that motivate the decision-making process (indirect drivers). Furthermore, some drivers are under the control of the decision-maker (endogenous drivers) and some are not (exogenous driv-ers). (See Box 4.2.) These categories are indicated by the boxes on the right side of Figure 4.1 and the arrows between the drivers, the ecosystem, and the decision process. As discussed elsewhere in this chapter, the condition of an ecosystem is influenced by natural drivers, such as climate and biological processes, over which the decision-maker has no control. These direct drivers alsocondition the decisions made. The natural capacity of an ecosystem is aFIGURE 4.1 Decision-making, Drivers, and Ecosystem Services at the Local Level MA_CF-85-106.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:18 AM 92Drivers of Change in Ecosystems and Their Services 93 function of abiotic (nonliving) and biotic (living) characteristics, includ- ing geomorphology, soil quality, weather conditions, and biodiversity. Thenatural capacity makes some potentially desirable ecosystem services bio- logically impossible (growing coffee in Canada, for instance) while others would require dramatic changes in the ecosystem. The natural capacitydiffers strongly between localities and regions. Coarse-scale patterns are largely determined by climate and parent material of the soil, while fine- scale patterns are defined by ecological, soil, and management processesand by land use history. The state of the natural capacity at the time a decision is taken sets the initial condition for the range, level, and quality of intended services that can be obtained. In addition, a potentially largenumber of local, sub-global, and global forces influence the decision pro- cess directly and therefore the drivers under control of the decision-maker. The effect of an externality (indicated by the arrows to the right of the decision consequences in Figure 4.1) is seldom confined to the environs of the decision-maker. External effects extend to other parts of the ecosys- tem and even to other ecosystems. It is possible for individually unimpor-BOX 4.2 Examples of Exogenous and Endogenous Drivers at the Local Level Selected exogenous local drivers include: \u0084indirect drivers that influence the decision-making process - institutions (such as property rights, community organizations, or market- ing regulations), - prices and markets, and - technology development. \u0084direct drivers that directly affect ecosystem condition and services - some ecosystem characteristics, and - local effects of regional and global environmental change (such as increased mean temperature from rising carbon dioxide concentrations or lower mean temperature from volcanic pollution). Selected endogenous local drivers include: \u0084indirect drivers that influence the decision-making process - technology adaptation (such as fish location technology or precision agriculture). \u0084direct drivers that directly affect ecosystem condition and services - changes in local land use and land cover, - species introductions and removals, and external inputs (such as fertilizer use, pest control, or irrigation water). MA_CF-85-106.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:18 AM 9394 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment tant external effects to have dramatic regional and global consequences when many local decision-makers simultaneously take decisions with simi- lar unintended consequences. Ecosystem Consequences of Decisions Outside anEcosystem The discussion thus far has focused on decision-making within an ecosys-tem and the decision-making process that directly affects the ecosystem and its services. But there are many decisions made to bring about out-comes that are not directed at a specific ecosystem or its services. What we call the regional level is intended to encompass all these other deci- sion-makers. One way to categorize these decision-makers is the distinction between private (entrepreneurs and business) and public (government and non- governmental organizations [NGOs]). As a generalization (albeit withmany exceptions), the private decision-maker has personal gain as a primary motive while public decision-makers are motivated by the well- being of the unit for which they are making decisions. Private decision-makers include individuals and communities that make collective decisions for local, national, and global businesses. Political decision-mak- ing takes place in units that include nations, sub-national units (county,district, municipal, province, or state), supra-national units (groups of na- tions such as the European Union that have some common legal, eco- nomic, and political institutions), and trading communities (such as theNorth American Free Trade Association or regional groupings such as the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation). Regardless of the motivation of these decision-makers, few if any of the units for which decisions are made are synonymous with an ecosystem. A county, state, or nation can encompass multiple ecosystems. Or a single ecosystem can cross multiple jurisdictional boundaries. As a result, effortsto mitigate negative externalities often require negotiations among mul- tiple decision-makers with differing interests. An almost limitless range of interactions is possible between the re- gional and the local levels. The ecosystem decision-maker at the local level uses inputs from the regional level in the process of enhancing provi- sioning and supporting ecosystem services. Ecosystem services from thelocal level, intended or unintended, are inputs into activities at the re- gional level. In turn, decisions made at the regional level can affect mul- tiple ecosystems. Some regional decisions are intended to influence eco-system conditions and services. Examples include land, water, and natural MA_CF-85-106.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:18 AM 94Drivers of Change in Ecosystems and Their Services 95 resource policies. Many other decisions taken at this level with no intent to affect an ecosystem nonetheless have consequences for it. The intent of these decisions is to influence activities in the domains over which they have some control\u2014a political, business, or community unit\u2014that doesnot necessarily correspond with an ecosystem or biome. A wide range of factors influences decisions at the regional level. Un- like local ecosystem decisions, however, many more factors at this levelare endogenous. The number of exogenous factors depends in part on the relationship among the various units involved. Although we refer to the region as a single level, it actually encompasses many nested and overlap-ping levels of control and decision-making. For example, most nations have sub-national political units (states or provinces), and these units are often further divided into counties, districts, and municipalities. The sub-national, national, international structure provides a natural hierarchy of endogenity for drivers. Decision-making at higher levels in- fluences factors that are exogenous to decision-makers at lower levels. Forexample, international grain markets collectively determine world wheat prices; national governments can influence prices that farmers receive with trade and production taxes and subsidies, but farmers treat those prices asexogenous. Or a national government can set air pollution standards that affect sulfur dioxide emissions from individual power plants. For the plant manager, the regulation is exogenous, and for the forest managers down-wind, the reduction in acid rain is exogenous. But this hierarchy is by no means exclusive. Some drivers are endog- enous at the local level but exogenous at the regional level. For example,land use management rules such as zoning regulations are frequently a local decision over which the state or national government has no con- trol. Furthermore, the degree to which a driver is outside the influence ofa decision-making process depends to some extent on the temporal scale. Some factors may be exogenous in the short run but subject to change by a decision-maker over longer periods. At the regional level, then, the endogenous drivers of decision-making often include: \u0084institutions (such as property rights or trade barriers), \u0084service and commodity prices and markets, \u0084technology development, and \u0084macroeconomic MA_CF-85-106.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:18 AM 9596 and for Assessment The exogenous drivers include: \u0084changes in land use and cover patterns, \u0084developments in basic science, and \u0084ecosystem characteristics. Drivers of Ecosystem Change The most important sets of drivers that the MA will use play out at all levels (global, regional, and local), but in differing time frames and combinations. Demographic Drivers The demographic variables that have implications for ecological systems include population size and rate of change over time (birth and death rates),age and gender structure of a population, household distribution by size and composition, spatial distribution (urban versus rural and by country and ecosystem), migration patterns, and level of educational attainment. The interactions among population and ecosystems are complex. Popu- lation size and other demographic variables influence the use of food, fi- ber, clean water, energy, shelter, transport, and a wide range of ecosystemservices. Increases in population decrease the per capita availability ofboth renewable and nonrenewable resources. When coupled with growing income and other factors such as urbanization and market development, population growth increases the demand for food and energy. Demographic projections suggest that future population growth rates will not be uniform throughout the world. At least 95 percent of the addi- tional 3 billion or so people likely to inhabit the planet in the next 50years will live in developing countries, and most will be in the tropics and sub-tropics. The U.S. Census Bureau projects a world population of 9.1 billion by 2050 (U.S. Census Bureau 2002), while the median projectionof the United Nations Population Bureau for 2050 is 8.9 billion (UN Popu- lation Division 2001). Other projections, however, cite both higher and lower numbers. In 1985, 75 percent of the world lived in developing coun-tries; this increased to 78 percent by 2000 and is projected to reach 86 percent by 2050 (UN Population Division 2001). Estimates are that the 49 lowest-income countries, which are mainly in the tropics and sub-tropics, will almost triple their population\u2014from 668 million to 1.86 bil- lion\u2014by 2050 (UN Population Division 2001). The location of the increases in population has important consequences for ecosystems at the local, regional, and global level. In the past 50 years, MA_CF-85-106.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:18 AM 96Drivers of Change in Ecosystems and Their Services 97 for example, on average 90 percent of food was produced in the country of consumption (FAO 2003). If there is no significant change in this ratio, and if the expected population growth in the tropics and sub-tropics ma- terializes, tropical and sub-tropical ecosystems will need to provide signifi-cantly more food in addition to the services they already provide. A further complication is that agricultural productivity in the tropics and sub-tropics is projected to suffer from human-induced climate change.Hence these ecosystems will be under considerable pressure in the coming decades. It should also be noted that nearly 50 percent of the current hu- man population live in the 12 megadiversity countries; where the popula-tion growth rate is expected to exceed that of the global average, these unique ecosystems will be under significant pressure (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity 2001). In contrast to the tropics and sub-tropics, the population of some re- gions, such as Eastern Europe, is projected to decrease over the next 50 years (U.S. Census Bureau 2002). The implications of negative populationgrowth on economic performance and ecological systems are uncertain. During the past 30 years, there has been a rapid increase in the per- centage of people living in urban centers, a trend that is expected to con-tinue over the next 30 years. In the period 2000-2030, world population is expected to increase by 2.2 billion people, of which 2.1 billion will be urban dwellers. In 1950, 30 percent of the population lived in urban areas;by 2000, the urban population increased to 47 percent, and it is projected to reach 60 percent by 2030 (UN Population Division 2002). In 1975, there were five megacities (with 10 million or more residents)\u2014two inindustrial countries and three in developing countries. By 2000, there were 19 megacities, of which 15 were in developing countries. And, by 2015, it is projected there will be 23 megacities, of which 19 will be in developingcountries (UNFPA 2002). Another important demographic dimension is the interaction between population growth and the distribution of income across individuals, coun-tries, and regions. A combination of extreme poverty for many, low na- tional income growth, and weak property rights can, in some instances, greatly increase pressure on fragile, marginal ecosystems. On the otherhand, wealthier societies are associated with high consumption patterns of energy and biological resources, which has its own implications for the demand for ecosystem services. Age, gender, and levels of education are also important demographic variables. Persons with different educational levels tend to vary in their impacts on the environment and in their vulnerability to environmental MA_CF-85-106.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:18 AM 9798 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment change. The number and distribution of households by size and composi- tion is important as well. Greenhouse gas emissions, and hence human- induced climate change, can be assumed to depend on the number of house- holds, not just the number of individuals (Roberts and Grimes 1997). The most crucial population variable in the long run is the rate of change both locally and globally, which is the nexus of birth, death, and migration rates. While the most hopeful dimension of the population equa-tion is that the global growth rate is falling as families around the world choose to have fewer children, a less hopeful sign is that life expectancy has declined dramatically in the Russian Federation due to changes ineconomic condition and in many sub-Saharan African countries due to HIV/AIDS. The bottom line is that demographic variables are critical drivers of the demand for ecosystem services and the capacity of the global ecosys- tem to provide them. Barring major dislocations, such as world war or pandemics, the number of people alive in 2050 and their geographic dis-tribution is an endogenous variable. Decisions made at national and sub- national levels can have a dramatic effect on population growth rates through their impact on sociopolitical and cultural factors\u2014in particular,in opportunities for education and the advancement of women and in urban-rural distribution. Decisions at the supra-national level can influ- ence migration across national boundaries. Economic Drivers Economic and social well-being are clearly affected by global economic growth and its distribution by country, sector, and individual. How growth is distributed determines the character of demand for ecosystem services.Global economic performance is more than simple changes in national economic activity. International trade, capital flows, and technology are crucial elements in global growth and its consequences for the world'secosystems. Moreover, the unprecedented rate of global interconnection is leading to dramatic changes in lifestyles and consumption patterns; the consequences of this for global ecosystems are not yet clear. Global economic trends that began in the last century will likely per- sist and probably strengthen as the twenty-first century unfolds. First, growth in international trade flows continues to exceed growth in globalproduction, and the differential may be growing. Between 1990 and 1998, for example, the 12 fastest-growing developing countries saw their exports of goods and services increase 14 percent and their output 8 percent (WorldBank 2002a). However, not all trade flows are equal in their effects on MA_CF-85-106.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:18 AM 98Drivers of Change in Ecosystems and Their Services 99 growth. Dollar and Collier (2001) found that the countries experiencing the most rapid trade-driven economic growth were trading a large share of high technology products. Therefore changes in the volume, value, direc- tion, and composition of trade must be carefully evaluated, along with thedegree of restrictions on flows. New and expanded regional and global trade agreements and institutions, such as the World Trade Organization, will likely increase the importance of international trade in global eco-nomic performance. Financial flows and policies affecting international capital movements are also critical. The trend of the late twentieth century toward more openeconomies led to greater uniformity in macroeconomic (monetary, fiscal, and exchange rate) policies across the world. This trend is manifested in increasing capital mobility and flexible exchange rate regimes, encour-aged by institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and regional development banks. But not all developing countries participated equally. For instance, the vast majority of private-sector capi-tal flows is concentrated in the 10 largest developing countries (World Bank 2002b). Identifying the key interactions among the rate of growth of an economy, the degree of inequality in the ownership of resources, and trade and capi- tal flows is crucial to understanding their impacts on land use patterns, resource extraction, water diversion and pollution, biodiversity losses, andthe landscape. Equally important is understanding the impact of sector- specific subsidies and taxes (on agriculture, energy, and so on), particu- larly in industrial countries, on local and global ecosystems. There is some controversy about whether the outcomes of global eco- nomic growth are sustainable. There is little question that some of the world's ecosystems have experienced unsustainable pressure. However, theevidence on which this statement is based could be improved consider- ably. There is a need for a systematic assessment of the potential negative impacts of growth on the resource base in both industrial and developingcountries. There is also evidence that the structure of economic growth has an impact on the extent of ecosystem pressure. Demand for services (as opposed to manufacturing), which tend to have fewer negative exter-nalities, rises with income. In addition, as per capita incomes rise, there is greater willingness to pay for mitigation and remediation. Sociopolitical Drivers \"Sociopolitical\" is a word that attempts to capture all the forces that lie in the large conceptual space between economics and culture that affect de- MA_CF-85-106.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:18 AM 99100 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment cision-making at all levels. Indeed, the distinction between sociopolitical and cultural factors blurs as the time scale is extended (Young 2002). Sociopolitical driving forces have been important in the past (e.g., Redman 1999; de Vries and Goudsblom 2002) and should be explicitly included inthe MA. Four categories of sociopolitical forces appear to be undergoing major changes at the beginning of the twenty-first century: \u0084The general role of the public in decision-making appears to be ex- panding, as evidenced by the extent of democratization. Despite somebacksliding, there is a declining trend in centralized, authoritarian gov-ernments and a rise of elected democracies. As well, there is some evi- dence of improving governance across the developing world. \u0084The voices that are heard and how they are expressed has changed, as evidenced in the changing role of women and the rise of civil society.Democratic institutions have also encouraged decentralized decision- making, with the intended beneficiaries having a greater say in the de- cisions made. This trend has helped empower local communities, espe-cially rural women and resource-poor households. Decentralizationtrends have also had an impact on decisions made by regional and in-ternational institutions, with the increasing involvement of NGOs andgrassroots organizations, such as traditional peoples groups. \u0084The mechanisms by which nations solve their disputes, peaceful andotherwise, are changing. Although the cold war has ended, the persis-tence of regional and civil wars and other international conflicts insome parts of the world continues to be a matter of concern. There is an urgent need to understand the driving forces behind such conflicts and their impact on sustainable livelihoods and the natural resource base. \u0084The declining importance of the state relative to the private sector\u2014asa supplier of goods and services, as a source of employment, and as a source of innovation\u2014is evident. The future functions of the state in provisioning public goods, security, and regulation are still evolving,particularly in the developing world. In both the developing and theindustrial world, the implications of privatization trends on the sus-tainable management of the local and global resource base are still notclear. Scientific and Technological Drivers The development and diffusion of scientific knowledge and technologies can have significant implications for ecological systems and human well- MA_CF-85-106.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:18 AM 100Drivers of Change in Ecosystems and Their Services 101 being. Rates of investment in research and development, rates of adoption of new technologies, changes in the productivity and extractive capabili- ties of new technologies, and the access to and dissemination of informa- tion through new technologies all have profound implications. The twentieth century saw tremendous advances in the understanding of how the world works physically, chemically, biologically, and socially and in the applications of that knowledge to human endeavors. From theintroduction of the automobile in the early years to commercialization of genetically modified crops and widespread use of information technology in the later years, many new products drew both praise and damnationregarding their effects on ecosystems. The twenty-first century is likely to see continued breathtaking advances in applications of materials science, molecular biology, and the information revolution\u2014with real potential toimprove human well-being around the planet. But these developments have uncertain consequences for ecosystems. Humans have been extremely successful in institutionalizing the pro- cess of scientific and technical change. The organizational structures that encourage researchers to make breakthroughs and use them to develop potentially valuable products\u2014such as research universities, publiclyfunded research centers, public-private collaborations for research and development, regulatory institutions, and international agreements that collectively determine intellectual property rules\u2014are either in place orbeing implemented in the industrial world. However, they are not in place in most developing countries. Furthermore, institutions to facilitate use of, and compensation for, indigenous knowledge are not well developed. Society's ability to manage the process of product dissemination\u2014 identifying the potential for adverse consequences and finding ways to minimize them\u2014has not always kept pace. This disparity became espe-cially obvious as the introduction of genetically modified crops met wide- spread opposition in many parts of the world. The protests in part resulted from the speed of advancement, as the rate of commercial adoptions ofthe first products of this new technology was unprecedented in a number of countries. At least 30 years passed between the development and wide- spread use of hybrid maize in industrial countries. For semi-dwarf rice andwheat in developing countries, a similar rate of use was reached only 15 years after development began (Babinard 2001). But use of genetically modified soybeans reached similar levels of use after only 5 years in Ar-gentina and the United States. The use of the Internet accelerated world- wide communication and the organization of protests. MA_CF-85-106.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:18 AM 101102 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment The state of scientific and technical knowledge at any given point in time depends on the accumulation of knowledge over time. Decision- makers can, however, affect the rate of change in scientific and technical knowledge through setting research priorities and changing levels of fund-ing. Domestic government funding for science and technology is driven by objectives such as scientific education, technology development, ex- port markets, commercialization and privatization, and military power.International donors strongly influence science and technology in devel- oping countries, primarily through the type of research they are willing to fund. The private sector responds to the perceived future for their prod-ucts, looking for those that will be the most acceptable and profitable. Drivers Determined by Cultural and Religious Values The word \"culture\" has many definitions in both the social sciences and in ordinary language. To understand culture as a driver of ecosystem change,it may be most useful to think of culture as the values, beliefs, and norms that a group of people share. In this sense, culture conditions individuals' perceptions of the world, influences what they consider important, andsuggests courses of action that are appropriate and inappropriate. And while culture is most often thought of as a characteristic of national or ethnic groups, this definition also acknowledges the emergence of cultures withinprofessions and organizations, along with the possibility that an individual may be able to draw upon or reconcile more than one culture. There is a substantial literature examining the role of culture in shap- ing human environmental behavior. It focuses primarily on variations within a nation rather than across nations, in part because it is extremely difficult to establish causal effects of a variable as broad in conceptualizationas culture. Two central concerns of the literature are the degree to which the environmentally salient parts of a culture are amenable to change and the degree to which culture actually influences behavior with regard tothe environment. There is considerable debate about the first concern. Again, broad generalizations are not warranted, but it is clear that some aspects of culture can change with great rapidity while other elements areinherently conservative. A substantial body of literature provides lessons on how policies and programs can most effectively produce cultural change around environ-mental behavior (Dietz and Stern 2002). Obviously, the relationship be- tween culture and behavior is context-specific. Indeed, one important les- son of research on this topic is that overarching generalizations are seldomcorrect, that the ability of culture to shape behavior depends on the con- MA_CF-85-106.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:18 AM 102Drivers of Change in Ecosystems and Their Services 103 straints faced by individuals, and that the effects of changing constraints on behavior depend on the culture of the individuals encountering the changes (Gardner and Stern 1995; Guagnano et al. 1995). At least since it was argued by White (1967) that environmental dis- ruption is a result of some elements of Judeo-Christian culture, there has been special interest in the role of religion in shaping environmental be- havior. Arguments that major world religions have led to national or re-gional differences in environmental impact have not been sustained. How- ever, there is a growing body of scholarship that examines how variations in religious beliefs within a society are related to environmental beliefsand values (Eckberg and Blocker 1989; Kempton et al. 1995; Eckberg and Blocker 1996). In addition, theologians have begun exploring in detail the teachings of the major world religious traditions with regard to theenvironment. Finally, religious precepts that prescribe acceptable and un- acceptable consumption patterns might have a significant impact on the demand for ecosystem services as population grows. Physical, Biological, and Chemical Drivers There are natural and human-induced physical, chemical, and biological drivers of change. Natural drivers include solar radiation, climate vari- ability and extreme weather events (such as droughts, floods, hurricanes,and cyclones), fires, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, pest and disease out- breaks, and natural biological evolution. The primary human-induced driv- ers include land use changes, climate change, air and water pollution, aciddeposition, soil erosion, soil salinization and fertility changes, irrigation, fertilizer use, harvesting, the use of persistent organic chemicals, and the introduction of non-native species. Key physical and biological characteristics include the living (plants, animals, and microorganisms) and nonliving (atmospheric composition, climate, soil, terrain, rivers, lakes, and oceans) components of the Earthsystem that sustain ecosystems and human life. Earth has evolved over millions of years through the interactions between living organisms and their environment. These interactions facilitated new life forms and land-scapes, and the current conditions of a life-supporting atmosphere. Human societies have for centuries affected the local environment through land use practices, domestication of plants and animals, and theintroduction of exotic species to an area, but the cumulative effect of their activities are now for the first time dominating many regional and global processes\u2014biodiversity, global biogeochemical cycles, and climate (IPCC2002)\u2014in part driven by increasing demand for food, fiber, clean water, MA_CF-85-106.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:18 AM 103104 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment energy, minerals, and transport. Understanding how human activity af- fects the basic geology and biology of the planet is crucial to assessing the future capacity of the global ecosystem. Many of these drivers are changing and are projected to continue to change in the coming decades in many parts of the world, as indicated by these examples: \u0084conversion and fragmentation of ecosystems in many parts of the world, as illustrated by an annual rate of tropical deforestation of about 0.7percent (Houghton et al. 2001); \u0084climate change, with the expectation of warmer temperatures, changes in precipitation, and increases in extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods, and droughts and associated fires and pest outbreaks(Houghton et al. 2001; McCarthy et al. 2001); \u0084a global rise in sea level (Houghton et al. 2001; McCarthy et al. 2001); \u0084degradation of air, water, and land, especially in many developing coun-tries (Stafford-Smith and Reynolds 2002); and \u0084planned and inadvertent nonnative species (Heywoodand Watson 1995; Dukes and Mooney 1999). Interactions among Drivers Changes in ecosystem services are always caused by multiple, interacting drivers originating from different levels of organization of the coupled human-environment systems. For example, many changes are driven by acombination of drivers that work over time (such as population growth and climate change) and drivers that happen intermittently (droughts, wars, or economic crises, for example). There are functional interdepen-dencies between the drivers of changes in ecosystem services, both at each organizational level (horizontal interplay) and between levels of organiza- tion (vertical interplay) (Young 2002). Moreover, the changes in ecosystem services lead to feedbacks on the drivers of changes. For example, changes in ecosystems create new oppor- tunities and constraints for land use, induce institutional changes fromlocal to global levels in response to perceived and anticipated resource degradation, and give rise to social changes in the form of income differ- entiation (as there are winners and losers in environmental change). MA_CF-85-106.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:18 AM 104Drivers of Change in Ecosystems and Their Services 105 The drivers of change may follow different modes of interactions: \u0084One cause may temporarily dominate other drivers in a certain period. For example, local changes in ecosystems are caused not by climatechange but by habitat loss. This fact has been used by non-biologists toargue that climate change is of little importance to ecosystems. This approach, however, effectively ignores small, systematic trends in driv- ers that may become important in the longer term (Parmesan and Yohe2003). \u0084Factors driving changes in ecosystem services can be connected as causal chains\u2014that is, interconnected in a way that one or more variables (in- direct drivers, mainly) drive one or more other variables (direct drivers). \u0084Different factors can intervene at the same time\u2014for instance, inde-pendent but synchronous operation of individual factors can lead to land change. \u0084Different factors may also intervene in synergetic factor combinations\u2014 that is, several mutually interacting variables drive changes in ecosys-tem services over time. Reviews of case studies reveal that the most common type of interac- tion is synergetic factor combinations (Geist and Lambin 2002). This implies combined action of multiple drivers that produces an enhanced or increased effect due to reciprocal action and feedbacks between drivers. The complexity in the interactions among drivers of changes in ecosys- tem services can be greatly reduced by recognizing that there are a limited number of ways in which these drivers are actually combined. For anygiven human-environment system, a restricted set of drivers is essential in order to predict the general trend in the ecosystem. This makes the prob- lem tractable. This idea is the basis, for example, of the syndrome approach(Petschel-Held et al. 1999), for the analyses of trajectories of environmen- tal criticality (Kasperson et al. 1995), of major spirals of household erishment and environmental degradation (Kates and Haarmann 1992),of pathways of land use change (Lambin et al. 2001), and of spatial eco- nomic models of land use change (Nelson and Geoghegan 2002). Models have captured some of the generalizable patterns of change that result from recurrent interactions among driving forces. For example, the environmental Kuznets curve describes the relationship between en- vironmental degradation and economic growth, which holds true for arange of ecological issues\u2014those at the local scale, which affect a popula- tion in the short term (Kuznets 1979). Case studies also identify specific MA_CF-85-106.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:18 AM 105106 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment sequences of events leading to changes in ecosystem services. Tropical deforestation sometimes results from a sequence of extraction of timber plus initial colonization, for instance, followed by the establishment of colonists with greater access to capital. Competition for access to landtakes place and leads to increasing land holdings for the winners, while the losers are pushed to expand the agricultural frontier further. If cattle provide the largest economic rewards for the winners, given market con-ditions and government subsidies, large-scale land conversion to pasture follows. This, in turn, drives up land prices, leading to further land con- solidation (Lambin et al. 2001). In other cases, macroeconomic declinegenerates large numbers of unemployed people who move into forest areas that are effectively open access. They survive by clearing forest patches of subsistence crops and converting wood to charcoal for sale (Cruz andRepetto 1992). Even though these sequences may play out differently at the detailed level in specific situations, their identification may confer some predictive power by analogy with similar pathways in comparableregional and historical contexts. The many processes of globalization lead to new forms of interactions among people and between drivers of changes in ecosystem services; theyamplify or attenuate the driving forces by removing regional barriers, weak- ening national connections, and increasing the interdependency among people and between nations. Globalization can either accelerate or bufferthe impact of sectoral drivers on ecosystems, but it always gives rise to a greater level of functional interdependencies among drivers between lo- cal, national, regional, and global levels. MA_CF-85-106.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:18 AM 1065Dealing with Scale EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \u0084There is seldom one, ideal scale at which to conduct an ecosystem assess- ment that will suit several purposes. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment(MA) advocates a multiscale approach. \u0084Many environmental problems originate from the mismatch between the scaleat which ecological processes occur and the scale at which decisions on themare made. Outcomes at a given scale are often critically influenced by interac-tions of ecological, socioeconomic, and political factors from other scales. Fo-cusing solely on a single scale is likely to miss such interactions, which arecritically important in understanding ecosystem determinants and their im-plications for human well-being. \u0084The choice of scale and boundaries of an assessment is not politically neutral.It can implicitly favor certain groups, systems of knowledge, types of informa-tion, and modes of expression. Reflecting on the political consequences ofscale and boundary choices is an important prerequisite to exploring howmultiscale and cross-scale analysis in the MA might contribute to decision-making and public policy processes at various levels. \u0084Ecosystem processes and the services they deliver are typically most stronglyexpressed, most easily observed, or have their dominant drivers or conse-quences at particular scales in space and time. The spatial and temporal scalesare often closely related, defining the scale domain of the process. \u0084Social, political, and economic processes can be more readily observed at some scales than others, and these may vary widely in terms of duration and extent.Furthermore, social organization has more- or less-discrete levels, such as thehousehold, community, and nation, that correspond broadly to particular scaledomains in time and space. \u0084Assessments need to be conducted within a sc ale domain appropriate to the processes or phenomena being examined. Those applicable to large areas gen-erally use data at coarse resolutions, which may not detect fine-resolution pro-cesses. Even if data are collected at a fine level of detail, presentation of thefindings at a larger scale means local patterns, anomalies, and the exceedingof thresholds disappear. \u0084A multiscale approach that simultaneously uses larger- and smaller-scale as-sessments can help identify important dynamics of the system that might otherwise be overlooked. Trends that occur at much larger scales, althoughexpressed locally, may go unnoticed in purely local-scale assessments. 107 MA_CF-107-126.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 107108 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment \u0084If an assessment covers a shorter time period than the time scale of important processes, it will not adequately capture variability associated with, for instance,long-term cycles such as climatic or economic trends. Slow changes are oftenharder to detect than rapid changes, given the short period for which data areavailable. \u0084Given the pervasive influence of scale on any conclusions reached, it is essen-tial that assessments be explicit regarding the geographic extent and periodof time for which the study is valid. The same applies for data sets that are usedin assessments. Introduction Scale refers to the physical dimensions, in either space or time, of phe- nomena or observations (O'Neill and King 1998). This is expressed in physical units, such as meters or years. In the Millennium Ecosystem As-sessment (MA), the word \"level\" is used to describe the discrete levels of social organization, such as individuals, households, communities, or na- tions (Gibson et al. 2000). A level of organization is not a scale, but it canhave a scale (Allen 1998; O'Neill and King 1998). It is necessary to distinguish the \"scale of observation\" from the \"scale of the phenomenon.\" The scale of observation is a construct based onhuman systems of measurement. Observation scale has three components: extent (or duration), resolution, and grain (Bl\u00f6schl and Sivapalan 1995; Bl\u00f6schl 1996). The extent is the total area or time over which a phenom-enon is observed, the resolution is the interval or distance between obser- vations, and the grain is the area or duration of an individual observation. These concepts are illustrated in Figure 5.1. Independent of the scales atwhich things are observed by humans and their instruments, there are characteristic scales at which both ecological and human processes occur. The characteristic scale of a process describes the typical extent or dura-tion over which the process is expressed\u2014that is, over which it has its impact. The scale domain of a process is defined in terms of both its char- acteristic space and time scales. The grain of a phenomenon is a conceptdistinct from the grain of observation, and refers to the smallest unit that is internally homogenous. In the MA, unless otherwise stated, the word \"scale\" means the extent or duration of observation, analysis, or process. For instance, an assess- ment can be said to be \"at the regional scale,\" or the time scale of the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon is \"at the decadal scale.\" The term indi-cates something of greater \"small conforms to the MA_CF-107-126.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 108Dealing with Scale 109 natural language usage of those phrases, although it is the opposite of com- mon usage in cartography. \"Long term\" and \"short term\" are used in arelative the time dimension, while \"higher level\" and \"lower level\" are used to reflect hierarchical institutional or social organizational levels. Higher levels have greater scope of operation or influence thanlower levels. Emergent properties may appear at some scales or levels of organiza- tion. The description of these properties is confined to those particularscales. An emergent property is a phenomenon that is not evident in the constituent parts of a system but appears when they interact as a system. For example, the cultural or recreational value of an ecosystem is often anFIGURE 5.1 Three Components of Scale of Observation The scale of observation can be described in terms of its extent, resolution, and grain. For example, in observing river discharge over time, grain refers to the time spent taking each sample, resolution refers to the time between observations, and extent refers to the total time period over which the samples were taken (based on Bl\u00f6schl 1996). Similarly, inobserving household expenditure in a particular area, grain refers to an individual house- hold, resolution refers to the density and distribution of observed households over space, and extent refers the total area over which observations were made. In the special cases ofcontinuous digital images or data recorders, grain is equal to resolution and in the former case is referred to as a pixel. Grain can also refer to the characteristics of the phenomenon itself\u2014the smallest unit that is internally homogeneous, independent of the observer. MA_CF-107-126.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 109110 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment emergent property at the scale of a landscape (a heterogeneous area con- sisting of a mixture of different patches, typically many kilometers in ex- tent). There is debate about whether emergent properties have objective reality or are just a useful way of understanding and describing a system(Giampetro in press). Scale is also related to variation and predictability: small-scale events show more variability than large-scale events do. This is because the ef-fects of local heterogeneity are averaged out at broader scales, so that pat- terns appear to be more predictable (Weins 1989; Levin 1992). Conversely, models or assessments focusing on broad-scale patterns lose predictive ac-curacy at specific points in space and time (Costanza and Maxwell 1994). Why Scale Matters In assessing ecosystem services, scale matters for two main reasons. First,ecological and social systems and processes operate at a wide variety of scales\u2014from very small and short to very large and long\u2014and between scales they can change in their nature and sensitivity to various drivingforces. It cannot be assumed that results obtained at one scale are auto- matically valid at another (Kremen et al. 2000; McConnell 2002). Thus if the impacts of processes are observed or assessed at scales sig- nificantly smaller or larger than their characteristic scale, there is a likeli- hood of drawing the wrong conclusion. For instance, it is inappropriate to draw any conclusions regarding long-term trends based on short-durationtime series data. People do not infer that the primary productivity of the world is declining just because in the Northern Hemisphere leaves die in the autumn; based on experience, it is obvious that this is part of a longer-term seasonal cycle. Nor can it be assumed that because a change is occur- ring at one location it is occurring equally at all locations. It is springtime in the Southern Hemisphere during autumn in the North. Second, cross-scale interactions exert a crucial influence on outcomes at a given scale. Focusing solely on a single scale can miss these interac- tions. Looking at a particular issue top-down, from the perspective of largerscales or higher institutional levels, can lead to different conclusions than looking at the same issue bottom-up, from the perspective of smaller scales or lower levels (Berkes 2002; Lovell et al. 2002). The scale of the assess-ment influences both the framing of an issue and the range of possible actions and institutional responses. Where cross-scale interactions in eco- logical and social systems occur, there should be no expectation of findinga single most appropriate level for response or policy. In most cases, mutu- MA_CF-107-126.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 110Dealing with Scale 111 ally supportive policy changes and responses at different levels are required in order to bring about desired results. Individual systems important to ecological and social change arise from different scale domains of nature and society (Clark 1985; Peterson andParker 1998). Scale has close connections with where, how, and by whom decisions are made regarding the use of ecosystem services. Scale also re- lates to how different actors learn about ecological change. Integratedunderstandings are of necessity nearly always place-based, and aggregates of observations drawn from smaller scales nearly always contain more de- tail than observations at a very general scale, offering opportunities forricher kinds of learning (e.g., Environment Canada 1997). The \"domain argument\" (Wilbanks and Kates 1999) for conducting a multiscale assessment becomes even more persuasive when taking intoaccount the many interactions across scales: \u0084Human rules and behavioral norms are embedded in scale-dependent institutional structures such as the boundaries of political jurisdictions. The spatial range of individual actions is restricted to the area of access rights: an agricultural plot, a forest patch, or a lake, for instance. Yet thesocial, economic, and political structures in which the actors are em-bedded are of larger scale\u2014provincial, national, or even global. A localassessment is \"local\" not because it considers only local constraints andprocesses but because even while it takes account of factors and deter- minants from different scales, it is framed from the point of view of local stakeholders and it considers decisions and actions taken at thatlevel. To be effective, local assessments must adequately reflect relevant factors and determinants from larger scales. \u0084Characteristic scales of ecological and human processes often do notmatch. Thus an integrated assessment of human-ecosystem interactionshas to synthesize across scales (Rotmans and Rothman in press). Forinstance, the characteristic time scale for effective adaptation in eco-system management depends on both human capabilities for changingmanagement practices and the processes of structural change in the ecosystem. \u0084Cross-scale interactions can reveal hierarchical systems\u2014that is, sys- tems that \"are analyzable into successive sets of subsystems\" (Simon1962:468). Hierarchical systems display a special type of nested orderli- ness and have particular resilience properties (Peterson 2000). The minimum requirement for an assessment of ecosystem services is that it should be explicit about the scale and resolution of analysis. The MA_CF-107-126.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 111112 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment MA aspires to go beyond this by considering interactions across scales and levels of social organization. From the outset, the MA has been conceived as a multiscale effort, with attention to processes at several scales in space and time and at various institutional levels. (See Box 5.1.) Changing Scales Observations drawn from studies at widely different scales are only com-parable with considerable care. Comparisons are valid only after carefultesting to ensure that scale dependencies have been accounted for. Vari- ables used to describe ecosystem services and their drivers can be thought of as belonging to one of three scaling categories: scale-independent, scale-dependent with known scaling rules, and non-scalable. Scale-independent variables exhibit conservation of mass or value and show no (or weak) spatial or temporal interdependencies. To make thenumerical values of such variables scale-independent, they can be divided by the measurement area (such as per square meter) or duration (per day, for instance). Population density (people per unit area) is an example.Scale-independent variables can be \"scaled\"\u2014that is, translated from the scale at which the data were collected to a larger or smaller scale\u2014in a very straightforward way through simple addition or proportionality. Anexample is biomass: the biomass of a hectare of forest is the simple sum ofBOX 5.1 The Rationale for Multiscale Assessments The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment is a multiscale assessment. The main rea- sons for introducing multiple scales in an already complicated assessment are the following: \u0084They permit individual ecological and social processes to be assessed at the scale at which they operate and to be linked to processes at different scales andlevels of social organization. \u0084They allow progressively greater spatial, temporal, or causal detail to beconsidered as the scale becomes finer. \u0084They allow for independent validation of larger-scale conclusions by smaller-scale studies and create a context at larger scales for findings at smaller scales. \u0084They permit reporting and response options to match the scales at whichsocial decision-making occurs, with which people can relate, and on which they can act\u2014the local community, the province, the nation, the regional bloc, and the planet. MA_CF-107-126.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 112Dealing with Scale 113 the biomass within each square meter of the forest. If the biomass is ho- mogeneous over the scale of extrapolation, then every piece of the forest does not need to be measured to get the total. It is simply the total area multiplied by the biomass per unit area in the sub-sample. In the second category, scale-dependent but with known (or poten- tially knowable) scaling rules, variables are \"scalable\"\u2014that is, they can be expressed in smaller or larger aggregated units. But they must first betranslated to a consistent scale, and the scaling rules may be complex and are often nonlinear. Transpiration is an example. Transpiration from a hectare of forest is not simply the transpiration measured at the scale of aleaf multiplied by the number of leaves in a hectare. This is because the transpiration from one leaf alters the humidity surrounding the leaves down- wind of it, and thus their transpiration rate. Scaling of evapotranspirationcan be achieved using an explicit model involving a nonlinear coupling constant (Jarvis and McNaughton 1986). Many social and ecological pro- cesses belong in this category. They tend to follow nonlinear or discon-tinuous scaling rules for a variety of reasons, including spatial or temporal interactions (especially feedbacks), organizational scope and the limits of institutional authority, and high heterogeneity or changes in the nature ofthe regulating factors as the scale changes. Terrestrial carbon balance is an example of a variable that can be ex- pressed in consistent physical units (grams of carbon per square meter peryear) at all scales, but its interpretation changes with temporal and spatial scale. At the time scale of a few minutes and the scale of a leaf, the bal- ance is called net photosynthesis (during the day) or respiration (at night).At the time scale of 24 hours or more, it is called net primary production (if considering plants only) or net ecosystem exchange (plants plus ani- mals plus microbes). Over a period of decades or centuries, rare but largefluxes due to disturbance are included (such as fire, storms, harvest, or pest outbreaks), and the balance is called net biome production. The numeri- cal value of net biome production is one hundredth or less the value of netphotosynthesis. Non-scalable variables or processes are those whose meaning is de- fined only at a particular scale. The process of decision-making within ahousehold, for instance, may not be scaled up to the nation: different prin- ciples apply. Such variables can only be \"qualitatively scaled\" by placing them in clusters with conceptually related variables at different scales. Assessments frequently compare or combine observations drawn from studies whose scales were determined independently. The main alterna- tives for doing so are to convert the observations to a single scale or to MA_CF-107-126.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 113114 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment seek a multiscale or meta-scale synthesis. Conceptually, it has been sug- gested that convergence approaches (that is, bringing everything to a com- mon scale) imply that process representations can be transferred seamlessly across scales, while multiscale approaches imply a rejection of that pointof view (Bauer et al. 1999). Converting scale-related information to a common metric often fo- cuses on an intermediate scale, which calls for \"downscaling\" data aboutglobal processes and \"upscaling\" data about local processes (Wilbanks in press). Scaling up can be as intricate and fundamental a problem as downscaling. Harvey (2000) distinguishes between the use of lumpedmodels, deterministically or statistically distributed models, and models with explicit spatial integration: lumped models use the same model rep- resentation for each scale, sometimes with implicit scaling in the form ofparameter changes (Bugmann et al. 2000); distributed models use the same equation on a spatially explicit grid; and explicit integration seeks to for- mulate a correct representation for the higher-scale processes. Scaling upis essentially an aggregation challenge, complicated by the fact that sim- ply adding smaller-scale values can give misleading results. For instance, the data may not meet standards for valid sampling, or they may fail tocapture stochastic (random) variability in processes. The challenges are especially acute when larger-scale values are being estimated from incom- plete local evidence. A number of technical alternatives for dealing withstatistical problems in upscaling have been summarized (Rastetter et al. 1992; Harvey 1997). Downscaling is a different challenge, involving collecting or estimat- ing data at finer scales (such as regional or local values) from processes studied at larger scale. Modelers use both numerical (model-based) and empirical (data-based) approaches for this (Bass and Brook 1997; Easterlinget al. 2000). Problems include limited data availability at detailed scales (and the costs of filling any gaps) and increasing complexity of causal relationships in more integrated, small-scale models. One of the forcesencouraging downscaling is the need to provide information relevant to public participation, decision-making, and action at a relatively local scale. Box 5.2 provides some practical guidance on dealing with scale-related data issues. Space and Time Domains One of the grand queries of science is understanding relationships betweenmacro-scale and micro-scale phenomena and processes, between short- MA_CF-107-126.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 114Dealing with Scale 115 term and long-term effects, and during implementation at different orga- nizational levels (Wilbanks and Kates 1999; Gibson et al. 2000; Kates etal. 2003). The time and space scales of a process are frequently correlated and are together referred to as the scale domain of the process (Bisonette 1997).\"Big\" processes are often \"slow,\" and \"small\" processes are often \"fast.\" (See Figure 5.2.) A fast process (or variable) is one that changes rapidly in relation to the life span of the organisms or entities that it is acting on. Aslow process changes only gradually relative to the internal dynamics of the system being analyzed. In a forest ecosystem, for example, small and fast scales are dominated by biophysical processes controlling individualplant physiology and morphology. At the scale of a patch (tens of meters), interspecific competition for nutrients, light, and water influence growth, species composition, and succession over a period of decades. At foreststand scales, consisting of many patches, disturbances such as fire and in- sect outbreaks determine landscape heterogeneity over centuries. At theBOX 5.2 Suggestions for Working with Information at Different Scales If possible, convert studies of scale-dependent variables to a compatible scale before comparing or combining them. If not, interpret the studies independently at their individual scales. Processes with nonlinear dynamics are seldom scale-independent: \u0084Weakly nonlinear processes may be approximated over limited parts of theirrange of scales by linear interpolation. \u0084For strongly nonlinear processes, a biased larger-scale estimate will becalculated if the inputs are averaged and then passed through the process. The correct approach is to calculate the output at each point for which input data are available, and then sum over space or time. In upscaling, to generate an unbiased aggregation of a sparsely sampled variable from an uneven environment, use a richly sampled indicator that covaries with the variable of interest (a scalar) to create a weighted average. In downscaling, a probabilistic spatially or temporally explicit disaggregation of a heterogeneous variable can be constructed using a scalar. It is not always necessary to drop to the finest resolution or to rise to the highest possible level of integration in order to represent cross-scale interactions adequately.To determine or illustrate the cause of a phenomenon, drop down to the next logi- cal scale; to determine the constraints on a process, move up to the next logical scale. This is a rule of thumb, not a rigorous result, but is a useful way to limit thescope of an analysis.

MA_CF-107-126.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 116Dealing with Scale 117 largest scales, climate processes alter structure and dynamics across hun- dreds of kilometers over thousands of years. There are analogous space-time domains in social systems. For example, adaptive responses and behavioral changes at the individual level takeplace within an individual's lifetime, while societal responses often occurs over generations. In neither social nor ecological systems, however, is there necessarily a relationship between scales in space and time: some wide-spread changes have occurred very rapidly, and some local processes can be slow to change. The correlation between space and time scales can be particularly weak or absent in many modern social processes. It is specu-lated that this is due to the reach and speed of modern transport and infor- mation systems (Goodchild and Quattrochi 1997). The correlation between large-scale ecosystem changes and long time frames presents a dilemma for ecosystem service assessments. To answer questions about the maintenance or resilience of these services in the fu- ture, long-term processes and their interaction with behavior on shortertime scales need to be understood. An implication is that global scale assessments, in particular, may need to consider historical and prehistorical data in order to gain the deeper time perspective necessary for a robustunderstanding of some large-scale processes. Furthermore, ecosystem as- sessments should strive to establish baselines against which future changes can be measured. The links between characteristic scales in time and space can be used, cautiously, to infer long-term consequences by examining patterns over a large space domain. This is called a space for time substitution. For ex-ample, because large scales are likely to include areas undergoing rare events, instead of measuring net biome production over long periods (which is at any rate often impossible, given the short historical record), measurementscan be done over large areas. Another example is the determination of long-term fire frequency. Many researchers have assumed that fire frequency is equal to the area fraction of the landscape burned per year. This will beuntrue if it is the same parts of the landscape that burn repeatedly. Inertia in Human and Ecological Systems Both human and ecological systems frequently exhibit a property analo-gous to inertia in physical systems: the tendency to continue along a path- way of change after the pressure driving that change has been removed. The reason is that many of the processes involved have long time delaysbuilt into them. For instance, a fishery catch may continue to rise for a MA_CF-107-126.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 117118 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment period after the point of sustainable catch has been exceeded, simply be- cause of the maturation of juvenile fish that were hatched before the sustainability limit was passed (Rothschild 1986). Another example is sea level rise in response to climate change: this will continue for centuriesafter the emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere have been radi- cally reduced (IPCC 2002). Inertia in the ecological system tends to mute the signals of impending problems and can lead to a tendency to overshoot the target once correc- tive action has been instituted. The inertia in human systems can cause the implementation of effective action to lag behind the first detection ofthe problem by years to decades. The combination of these two forms of inertia in coupled ecological-human systems has the potential to allow the system to transgress thresholds that are either ecologically unsustain-able or socially unacceptable, and the resultant changes may be irrevers- ible in realistic time frames. There is a hypothesis, as yet unproven, that the \"slow variables\" (those with the largest inertia), rather than the \"fast variables,\" are responsible for the resilience properties of a system (see papers in Gunderson and Holling 2002). Viewing a Particular Scale in Context Processes that operate at a particular scale are typically related to pro-cesses at other scales as well. One familiar example is land use at a localscale, which results from local institutions and actions but is shaped by national policy frameworks and global economic markets. At the same time, local actions may add up either as cumulative changes (such as spe-cies extinction) or as systemic changes at a larger scale (such as the effects of emissions of ozone-depleting gases on the stratosphere) (Turner II et al. 1990). Since pieces of a geographic mosaic are nested within larger pieces, and those are within still larger pieces, it is often useful to think of geo- graphic areas in terms of hierarchies of places and place-related processes.Such approaches lend themselves to the application of hierarchy theory (e.g., O'Neill 1988). Simon (1974) argued that semi-autonomous levels are formed from the interactions among a set of variables that share simi-lar speeds and spatial domains. In understanding social scales, it may be useful to consider the differ- ent forms of hierarchy. In inclusive hierarchies, groups of processes or ob- jects lower in the hierarchy are contained within groups ranked as higher MA_CF-107-126.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 118Dealing with Scale 119 in the systems (such as modern taxonomic classifications). In exclusive hierarchies, groups of objects or processes that are ranked as lower are not contained within the groups at a higher level (military ranking systems, for example). And in a constitutive hierarchy, groups and processes arecombined into new units with their own functions and emergent proper- ties (a stakeholder committee, for instance). Some important social processes do not neatly fit into this concept of nested hierarchies, with space and time strongly correlated. Social net- works can introduce very strong connections between places, resulting in interaction across spatial and institutional boundaries. An example is theflow of ideas and coordination of action in different countries through transnational civil society organizations that do not necessarily flow through successive layers of a nested hierarchy. For instance, the Chipko (treehugger) movement in India was a local-scale action that was quickly in- ternationalized and that inspired similar social environmental movements worldwide. Such flows of ideas or advocacy for coordinated action alsotend to be opportunistic, jumping over or skipping scales as they \"shop\" for the scale or forum that would provide the greatest chance of successful outcomes (Keck and Sikkink 1999). Transfer of technologies and investments or sharing of stages of the com- modity production chain through parts of a transnational corporation are other examples of crossing boundaries. Processes of diffusion of technologi-cal and institutional innovations are often critical factors in the use of eco- system services. Thus network-related concepts are likely to be important in the MA for understanding connections between proximate and primarydeterminants or causal factors and for identifying possible response options. Network-related concepts are important as well in considering response options at small scales that may be replicated in larger domains withoutpassing through the neat nested hierarchies of governance structures. Scales in Ecological and Human Systems The characteristic spatial scales of ecological systems are influenced bynumerous factors, including the home range of individual mobile organ- isms or the range of influence of non-mobile organisms, the geographic distribution of a population of interbreeding organisms, the area over whicha disturbance occurs, and the distance over which material is transported during the period for which it is ecologically active. For instance, the effective lifetime of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is several centu-ries\u2014during this time it can be transported all over the world. Hence its MA_CF-107-126.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 119120 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment characteristic scale is global. In contrast, tropospheric ozone can only be transported by wind currents over a few hundred kilometers before it is consumed by atmospheric reactions; thus its characteristic scale is regional. Characteristic temporal scales of ecological systems are influenced by the life span of organisms, the turnover rate of material pools, and the average period between disturbances at a location. An important distinc- tion, particularly for determining system resilience, is between fast andslow variables or processes. Thresholds of irreversibility are typically re- lated to changes in the slow variables (Gunderson and Holling 2002). Spatial scales of social, political, and economic processes or variables are shaped by the area of operation, influence, or access rights exercised by various levels of institutions or social organization. Socioeconomic time scales are determined by the response times of humans and their institu-tions; they may be very rapid (electronic trading of commodities) or rela- tively slow (institutional change, typically). For example, the characteris- tic scale of an individual household in a freehold tenure system may be thearea of land that the people own; for a community, it may be a village or municipal boundary; and for a country, it is the area included in the na- tional borders and the exclusive economic zone in the ocean. The spatialscales of economic processes typically have a political dimension and are determined by the area over which goods or services are traded, extracted, transported, or disposed of. Economic and political processes are, in turn,embedded within and permeated by sociocultural processes that operate at different institutional levels. Direct interactions between humans and ecosystems\u2014in agriculture, for example, or forestry or land use\u2014mostly occur at local or micro scales and often at lower institutional levels. (See Figure 5.3.) This can also ap- ply to indirect actions. For instance, although climate change is a globalphenomenon, the responses of ecosystems are determined by the changes in the local climate rather than the global average change. Moreover, di- rect mitigation measures and behavioral responses also typically occur atthe local level. Ecosystem services, though often meeting needs expressed over large scales such as nations, are generally actually delivered at the local scale. Thus an assessment of ecosystem services and their implications for human well-being at global or regional scales typically needs to: \u0084scale up the ecosystem, taking each service in turn using specific scal- ing rules, including competition between different actors and differentservices; and MA_CF-107-126.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 120Dealing with Scale 121 \u0084scale down impacts on ecosystems by scaling down either the environ- mental pressures (such as by regionalizing the estimates of global climate change) or the socioeconomic activities (by predicting, forexample, where a logging company will harvest trees within a largeconcession area). It is possible to assess ecosystem services and human well-being more readily at some spatial scales than others. For the MA, as an integratedassessment, these scales are determined by the characteristic scales of both ecological and socioeconomic processes. Thus the planet, the region (a fraction of Earth's surface corresponding to a biome or a major politico-economic bloc), the drainage basin, and the local community tend to emerge repeatedly as chosen scales for the MA. Temporal scale is an issue in understanding human societies and insti- tutions in a variety of ways. Perhaps the most familiar case is benefit-cost approaches to estimating the value of economic investments at different time scales. For example, in considering investment choices, how shouldlong-term payoffs be evaluated relative to short-term payoffs? The con-FIGURE 5.3 Overview of Some Commonly Used Institutional Levels and Ecological Scales Levels are arranged on a shared vertical axis representing spatial extent.

MA_CF-107-126.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 121122 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment ventional approach is to use a discount rate, which compares future re- turns from the investment with what could be earned from a neutral in- vestment such as a mutual fund. Use of a high discount rate reduces the estimated value of longer-term returns, however, and is therefore biased infavor of investments that yield returns in the immediate or short term. (See also Chapter 6.) Temporal scale is also a key consideration in historical studies, includ- ing studies of institutional, technological, and sociopolitical change. It is common to treat short-term, mid-term, and long-term forecasts differently in terms of methods and assumptions, because the longer term raises somany uncertainties about contextual assumptions. Quantitative forecasts of economic and demographic change are usually limited to time horizons of 25-30 years, if that; the longer term is considered the province of futur-ists rather than forecasters and is couched in terms of scenarios rather than predictions. Most analyses of human systems include multiple time frames. For in- stance, national politics has a short-term rhythm set by the schedule of elections, while longer-term trends move in such directions as privatization, devolution, and democratization. One subject of research has been whether long-term changes in hu- man systems show regular, predictable fluctuations. As an example, there may be a Kondratiev cycle of 50-60 years in macroeconomies, perhapsrelated to waves of technological change, and Kuznets cycles of 15-20 years related to infrastructure development (Berry 1991). Recent studies point to possible fundamental relationships between geophysical rhythmsand economic fluctuations (Berry 2000). Much of this work grows out of efforts to understand implications of natural climate variability over peri- ods of millennia, but it also addresses issues of seasonal, annual, decadal,and century-scale environmental change. Scale and Policy Politics of Scale The choice of scale is not politically neutral, because the selection may intentionally or unintentionally privilege certain groups. The adoption of a particular scale of assessment limits the types of problems that can be addressed, the modes of explanations that are allowed, and the generaliza-tions that are likely to be used in analysis. This applies to temporal and spatial scales as well as institutional levels. MA_CF-107-126.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 122Dealing with Scale 123 For example, the range of ecosystem services that are directly used and acknowledged as having important support functions is dependent on so- ciocultural contexts, and these are restricted in space. As the assessment is conducted at progressively larger scales, the number of ecosystem servicesthat are fully shared among places, and thus can be mapped \"wall-to-wall,\" drops. The local services that would be visible in a local assessment may no longer be visible in a regional or global assessment. The same basicecosystem processes (such as net primary production) can be seen as pro- viding different services at different scales\u2014timber at the local scale, but carbon sequestration at the global scale. These issues are critical for theMA because trade-offs between the services are likely. At various scales we need to ask: ecosystem services for whom? Analyzing these trade-offs requires understanding politics and markets. Many such cross-scale trade-offs are not perceived as such, but instead become conflicts or crises created by a more powerful group (often the state) around the provision of one favored form of ecosystem service fromwhich they can obtain rent or other benefits. Scale can be an argument that empowers state institutions. Most states view indigenous knowledge and institutions as local in scope, relevance, and power, whereas the rulesand knowledge of the state are viewed as bigger in scale, scope, and signifi- cance. As a consequence of this thinking, there is a strong tendency to override, minimize, or ignore local considerations, issues, or preferences.Many ecosystem management problems result from centralization and uniformity in bureaucratic operations that hinder local adaptation and learning. On the other hand, local adaptation is not universally good. Some-times a state is needed to deal with the externalities that may arise from local decisions or to arbitrate among competing local claimants to ecosys- tem services. Scale is thus critical for issues of governance of ecosystems,as discussed in the next section. Choice of time scales is equally important. If an assessment is focused on short-term concerns, then \"important\" ecosystem services are deemedto be those that are already or about to be threatened, such as freshwater resources for drinking, fuelwood supplies, or food production. On the other hand, if the users are more concerned with decisions that may have conse-quences over several decades or centuries, then issues of alterations of car- bon balance or opportunity and resilience costs of biodiversity loss be- come much more important. Adoption of a global scale immediately places issues such as climate change and carbon management at a much higher priority than, say, sani- tation or access to clean drinking water. The attractiveness of the multiscale MA_CF-107-126.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 123124 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment approach in the MA is that it provides the chance to think about problem identification and response options at more than one scale. It also allows for the analysis of spatial synergies and trade-offs among possible responses. Likewise, the choice of boundaries is not neutral but has political con- sequences. For example, setting boundaries as a watershed basin as op- posed to a geopolitical identity may make good sense from an ecological perspective, but it may be irrelevant for management if there is no politi-cal mechanism to deal with transboundary issues. Reflection on the political consequences of scale and boundary choices is an important prerequisite to exploring what multiscale and cross-scaleanalysis in the MA might contribute to decision-making and public policy processes. Designating the boundaries is best done through collaboration between scientists, decision-makers, and representatives from differentstakeholder groups. Institutional Fit and Interplay Many problems arise from the failure to recognize cross-scale interaction in both ecological and social systems (Young 1994). The effectiveness ofinstitutions governing the management and use of ecosystem services de- pends not only on their own characteristics but also on how they interact with other institutions. An important class of interactions is those thatoccur vertically across levels of governance; these often correspond to changes in spatial scale. The commonest forms of institutional interplay are those between state and local bodies. An emerging arena is the interplay between national institutions and new institutions at regional and international levels (Young 2002). These add a further layer of complexity to both future driving forcesof change as well as possible sources of rules and guidance for human choice. If cross-scale interactions in ecological and social systems affecting eco- system services are common, then it should not be expected that there isgenerally a single most appropriate level for response or policy. While re- sponses at certain levels or scales can have disproportionately greater sig- nificance or impact, appropriate responses at different levels are in generalneeded in concert to achieve desired results. Guidance for Multiscale Assessments Choosing the Appropriate Scales, Resolutions, and Boundaries Several different approaches have been suggested for determining the most appropriate scale for an assessment (Wilbanks in press). One seeks the MA_CF-107-126.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 124Dealing with Scale 125 scale at which data show maximum inter-zonal variability and minimum intra-zonal variability. Another seeks the scale that minimizes statistical error between observed and modeled phenomena (Easterling et al. 1998). A third weighs increased information from finer spatial resolution againstdifficulties of gathering and analyzing the information (Costanza and Maxwell 1994). The fact is, there is no single ideal scale for any instance of integrated assessment. The choice depends on the purposes of the analysis and is strongly conditioned by practical issues of data availability. The two most commonly used approaches are either to select a scale (often regional) onthe basis of empirical evidence about the process involved (e.g., Kasperson et al. 1995; Schellnhuber and Wenzel 1998) or to select scales that corre- spond to human systems for decision-making (Cash and Moser 1998). Despite the fact that the scale of a system is subjective (a function of the question being asked), the location of the boundaries should not be arbitrar y. There are more and less useful places to locate the boundaries. The guiding principle is that a well-defined system has key feedbacks in- cluded in it and weak, slow, constant, or unidirectional interactions across the boundaries. A practical approach to the spatial delimitation of an ecosystem is to build up a series of overlays of significant factors, mapping the location of discontinuities\u2014for instance, in the distribution of organisms, the bio-physical environment (soil types, drainage basins, shared markets), and spatial interactions (home ranges, migration patterns, fluxes of matter). A useful ecosystem boundary is one where a number of these relativediscontinuities coincide. An ecosystem boundary can move over time. For instance, a marine ecosystem may be associated with an upwelling, which develops, moves, and dissipates. Similar approaches can be used to delimithuman systems, such as the extent of particular patterns of land use or the political boundaries of a trade bloc. The systems addressed by the MA represent a pragmatic overlay of both ecosystem boundaries and humansystem boundaries. Not all ecosystem services need to be addressed at every assessment scale. If there is a substantial mismatch between the characteristic scale ofa process delivering a particular ecosystem service and the chosen scale of an assessment, it is preferable not to address that service then, leaving it to an assessment at a more appropriate scale (if such an evaluation exists). These considerations of scale are the key reasons for performing a multiscale assessment. Comprehensive assessments need to be sensitive to multiple scales in time and space rather than focused on a single scale, and MA_CF-107-126.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 125126 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment the local (or small-regional) end of the spectrum is often especially impor- tant. Processes at all relevant scales have to be included in the overall assessment, which requires appropriate methods to transfer, synthesize, and integrate information on data, variables, and processes between dif-ferent scales. If results of smaller-scale studies are to be aggregated to larger scales, the prospects are brighter if they follow similar practices in the questions asked, the measurement or estimation approaches used, and theformats used for reporting results. Since time is unidirectional, temporal explicitness is typically inherent in the way observations are made and results reported. Studies must be equally explicit in the spatial dimension,although they seldom are. The MA is designed as a collection of assessments, carried out partly independently at different scales, which are nested within one another insome cases. Effective approaches are needed for integrating top-down and bottom-up perspectives, particularly in the institutional domain, although the state of the art for such integration is not yet fully developed (Wilbanksin press). Integration across Scales Perhaps the greatest scale-related challenge to integrated, multiscale as- sessment is identifying, analyzing, and understanding linkages across scales.That they exist and are important is beyond question. The approach most often used is to analyze processes at several scales and then to examine how the findings at different levels correspond (e.g., Wu and Loucks 1995).An approach termed \"strategic cyclical scaling\" has been suggested in glo- bal change studies (Root and Schneider 1995). This calls for iterative cy- cling between upscaling and downscaling efforts, with each stage offeringinsights about the next as an understanding of cross-scale interactions grows. Other suggested approaches tend to be more theoretical than practical. For instance, it is possible to think about interaction across scales as anextension of hierarchy theory (Allen and Starr 1982; O'Neill 1988). Hier- archies of scale-related processes define \"constraint envelopes\" within which subordinate elements of the hierarchy operate. Other possible approachesinclude system dynamics and dynamic spatial simulation modeling. One relevant body of recent literature is associated with the work by the Resilience Alliance (Gunderson and Holling 2002). If systems areviewed at sufficiently long time scales, then the idea of an adaptive cycle (or configuration of states) may be valuable and can also be applied at various spatial scales. MA_CF-107-126.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 1266Concepts of Ecosystem Value and Valuation Approaches EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \u0084Decision-making concerning ecosystems and their services can be particu- larly challenging because different disciplines, philosophical views, and schoolsof thought conceive of the value of ecosystems differently. \u0084In the utilitarian (anthropocentric) concept of value, ecosystems and the ser-vices they provide have value to human societies because people derive util-ity from their use, either directly or indirectly (use values). People also valueecosystem services that they are not currently using (non-use values). \u0084Under the utilitarian approach, numerous methodologies have been devel-oped to try to quantify the benefits of different ecosystem services. These areparticularly well developed for provisioning services, but recent work has alsoimproved the ability to value regulating, supporting, and cultural services. Thechoice of valuation technique is dictated by the characteristics of each caseand by data availability. \u0084Non-utilitarian value proceeds from a variety of ethical, cultural, religious, andphilosophical bases. These differ in the specific entities that are deemed tohave value and in the interpreta tion of what having non-utilitarian value means. Notable among these are ecological, sociocultural, and intrinsic values. Thesemay complement or counter-balance considerations of utilitarian value. Thelegal and social consequences for violating laws or regulations based on anentity's intrinsic value may be regarded as a measure of the degree of thatvalue ascribed to them. \u0084The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment plans to use valuation as a tool thatenhances the ability of decision-makers to evaluate trade-offs between alter-native ecosystem management regimes and courses of social actions that al-ter the use of ecosystems and the services they provide. This usually requiresassessing the change in the mix of services provided by an ecosystem result-ing from a given change in its management. \u0084Most of the work involved in estimating the change in the value of ecosystembenefits concerns estimating the change in the physical flow of benefits (quan- tifying biophysical relations) and tracing through and quantifying a chain ofcausality between changes in ecosystem condition and human well-being. Acommon problem in valuation is that information is only available on some ofthe links in the chain, and often in incompatible units. 127 MA_CF-127-147.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:16 AM 127128 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment \u0084Ecosystem values in terms of services provided are only one of the bases on which decisions on ecosystem management are and should be made. Manyother factors, including notions of intrinsic value and other objectives thatsociety might have, such as equity among different groups or generations,will also feed into the decision framework. Introduction The importance or \"value\" of ecosystems is viewed and expressed differ- ently by different disciplines, cultural conceptions, philosophical views, and schools of thought (Goulder and Kennedy 1997). One important aimof the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) is to analyze and as much as possible quantify the importance of ecosystems to human well-being in order to make better decisions regarding the sustainable use and manage-ment of ecosystem services. Understanding the impact of ecosystem management decisions on hu- man well-being is an important objective. But if this information is pre-sented solely as a list of consequences in physical terms\u2014so much less provision of clean water, perhaps, and so much more production of crops\u2014 then the classic problem of comparing apples and oranges applies. Thepurpose of economic valuation is to make the disparate services provided by ecosystems comparable to each other, using a common metric. This is by no means simple, either conceptually or empirically. Society's ability todo so has increased substantially in recent years, however. Ecosystems have value because they maintain life on Earth and the services needed to satisfy human material and nonmaterial needs. In addi-tion, many people ascribe ecological, sociocultural, or intrinsic values to the existence of ecosystems and species. The MA recognizes these differ- ent paradigms, based on various motivations and concepts of value, alongwith the many valuation methods connected with them. Ecosystems and the provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services they provide have economic value to human societies because people derive utility from their actual or potential use, either directly or indirectly (known as use values). People also value ecosystem services they are not currently using (non-use values). This paradigm of value is knownas the utilitarian (anthropocentric) concept and is based on the principles of humans' preference satisfaction (welfare). Another set of values placed on ecosystems can be identified as the sociocultural perspective: people value elements in their environment based on different worldviews or conceptions of nature and society that are ethi- MA_CF-127-147.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:16 AM 128Concepts of Ecosystem Value and Valuation Approaches 129 cal, religious, cultural, and philosophical. These values are expressed through, for example, designation of sacred species or places, develop- ment of social rules concerning ecosystem use (for instance, \"taboos\"), and inspirational experiences. For many people, sociocultural identity isin part constituted by the ecosystems in which they live and on which they depend\u2014these help determine not only how they live, but who they are. To some extent, this kind of value is captured in the concept of \"cul-tural\" ecosystem services. To the extent, however, that ecosystems are tied up with the very identity of a community, the sociocultural value of eco- systems transcends utilitarian preference satisfaction. A different source of the value of ecosystems has been articulated by natural scientists in reference to causal relationships between parts of a system\u2014for example, the value of a particular tree species to control ero-sion or the value of one species to the survival of another species or of an entire ecosystem (Farber et al. 2002). At a global scale, different ecosys- tems and their species play different roles in the maintenance of essentiallife support processes (such as energy conversion, biogeochemical cycling, and evolution). The magnitude of this ecological value is expressed through indicators such as species diversity, rarity, ecosystem integrity (health),and resilience. With increasing scarcity of space, and with limited finan- cial resources, priorities have to be set regarding the conservation of the remaining biodiversity at all scale levels. The selection of protected areasand the determination of safe minimum standards regarding (sustainable) use of ecosystem services are based in part on these ecological values and criteria. The concept of ecological value is captured largely in the \"sup-porting\" aspect of the MA's definition of ecosystem services. Although the various value paradigms have no common denominator and may lack any basis for comparison, some valuation approaches corre-sponding to them overlap and interact in various ways. Human prefer- ences for all values can, to some extent, be measured with economic valu- ation methods, but ecological, sociocultural, and intrinsic value conceptshave separate metrics and should be used in the decision-making process in their own right. This chapter reviews the merits and deficiencies of these different valu- ation paradigms and how they complement or bound each other in assist- ing decisions and policy formulation for sustainable management and use of ecosystems. Ecological values are not discussed further here becausethey are dealt with extensively in Chapter 2. MA_CF-127-147.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:16 AM 129130 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment The Utilitarian Approach and Economic Valuation Methods The utilitarian paradigm of value is based on the fact that human beings derive utility from ecosystem services either directly or indirectly, whether currently or in the future. T wo aspects of this paradigm need to be stressed. First, the use that an individual human being derives from a given ecosys-tem service depends on that individual's motivations, including, for ex- ample, his or her needs and personal preferences. The utilitarian approach, therefore, bases its notion of value on attempts to measure the specificusefulness that individual members of society derive from a given service, and then aggregates across all individuals, usually weighting them all equally. Second, utility cannot be measured directly. In order to provide a com- mon metric in which to express the benefits of the widely diverse variety of services provided by ecosystems, the utilitarian approach usually at-tempts to measure all services in monetary terms. This is purely a matter of convenience, however, in that it uses units that are well recognized, saves the effort of having to convert values already expressed in monetaryterms into some other unit, and facilitates comparison with other activi- ties that also contribute to well-being, such as spending on education or health. It explicitly does not mean that only services that generate mon-etary benefits are taken into consideration in the valuation process. On the contrary, the essence of practically all work on economic valuation of environmental and natural resources has been to find ways to measurebenefits that do not enter markets and so have no directly observable monetary benefits. Motivations for Economic Valuation The most common reasons for undertaking a valuation of ecosystems are: \u0084to assess the overall contribution of ecosystems to social and economic well-being, \u0084to understand how and why economic actors use ecosystems as they do,and \u0084to assess the relative impact of alternative actions so as to help guidedecision-making. Numerous studies have assessed the contribution of ecosystems to cial and 1997; Hamilton and Clemens 1999). Eco- systems form part of the total wealth of nations and contribute flow ben- MA_CF-127-147.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:16 AM 130Concepts of Ecosystem Value and Valuation Approaches 131 efits, including social and cultural. But many ecosystem services are not traded, and hence their values are not captured in the conventional sys- tem of national accounts as part of total income. Moreover, in spite of the significant share of natural capital in total national wealth (World Bank1997), the value of its depletion or appreciation is typically not accounted for. As a result, conventional measures of wealth give incorrect indications of the state of well-being, leading to misinformed policy actions and ill- advised strategic social choices. For example, liquidation of natural assets to finance current consumption may appear to increase well-being whenit does not take into account the corresponding decline in the capacity of the natural system to sustain the flow of economic, ecological, social, and cultural benefits in the future. More appropriate indicators that accountfor the flow and asset values of ecosystems are crucial for accurate moni- toring of the implications of changes in ecosystem conditions for well- being. This is critical for the sustainable use and inter-temporal allocationof natural resources and for intergenerational equity. Valuation can help establish ecosystem values that allow correction of a country's national accounts (sometimes known as \"greening\") and construction of improvedindicators of changes in wealth and well-being. Better valuation of the services provided by a given ecosystem does not guarantee that it will be conserved, as the costs of conservation might still be found to exceed itsbenefits, but it will almost certainly result in a lower loss of ecosystem services than otherwise. Understanding why and how humans use ecosystems the way they do\u2014 for instance, why they cut natural forests, deplete soils, or pollute water surfaces\u2014is a second reason to undertake a valuation of ecosystems. Mar- kets guide the behavior and choices of individuals and public and privatedecisions. There is often a divergence, or wedge, between the market prices of goods and services as seen by individual economic agents and the social opportunity cost of using them. In particular, many services provided byecosystems tend to be underpriced or not priced at all, leading to the inef- ficient and, often, unsustainable use of resources. By showing the exist- ence and magnitude of differences between these private and social costsand benefits, valuation can help reveal policy and institutional failures (such as open access, public goods and externalities, or missing or incom- plete markets), providing useful policy information on alternative inter-vention options for correcting them, such as creating markets or improv- ing incentives. MA_CF-127-147.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:16 AM 131132 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment The MA plans to use valuation primarily for the third rationale for undertaking it: assessing the impacts\u2014the gains and losses\u2014of alterna- tive ecosystem management regimes. This provides a tool that enhances the ability of decision-makers to evaluate trade-offs between alternativeecosystem management regimes and courses of social actions that alter the use of ecosystems and the multiple services they provide. It must be stressed that the ecosystem values in the sense discussed in this section are only one of the bases on which decisions on ecosystem man- agement are and should be made. Many other factors, including notions of intrinsic value, as discussed later in this chapter, and other objectives thatsociety might have, such as equity among different groups or generations, will also feed into the decision-making framework. (See Chapter 8.) Total Economic Value The concept of total economic value (TEV) is a widely used framework for looking at the utilitarian value of ecosystems (Pearce and Warford 1993). (See Figure 6.1.) This framework typically disaggregates TEV into two categories: use values and non-use values. Use value refers to the value of ecosystem services that are used by humans for consumption or production purposes. It includes tangible and intangible services of ecosystems that are either currently used directly orindirectly or that have a potential to provide future use values. The TEV separates use values as follows:FIGURE 6.1 The Total Economic Value Framework MA_CF-127-147.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:16 AM 132Concepts of Ecosystem Value and Valuation Approaches 133 \u0084Direct use values. Some ecosystem services are directly used for con- sumptive (when the quantity of the good available for other users isreduced) or nonconsumptive purposes (no reduction in available quan-tity). Harvesting of food products, timber for fuel or construction, me-dicinal products, and hunting of animals for consumption from naturalor managed ecosystems are all examples of consumptive use. Nonconsumptive uses of ecosystem services include enjoying recre- ational and cultural amenities such as wildlife and bird-watching, watersports, and spiritual and social utilities that do not require a harvestingof products. This category of benefits corresponds broadly to the MAdescription of provisioning and cultural services. \u0084Indirect use values. A wide range of ecosystem services are used as inter- mediate inputs for production of final goods and services to humanssuch as water, soil nutrients, and pollination and biological control ser-vices for food production. Other ecosystem services contribute indi-rectly to the enjoyment of other final consumption amenities, such as water purification, waste assimilation, and other regulation services lead- ing to clean air and water supplies and thus reduced health risks. Thiscategory of benefits corresponds broadly to the MA notion of regulat-ing and supporting services. \u0084Option values. Despite the fact that people may not currently be deriv- ing any utility from them, many ecosystem services still hold value forpreserving the option to use such services in the future either by theindividual (option value) or by others or heirs (bequest value). Quasi-option value is a related kind of value: it represents the value of avoid-ing irreversible decisions until new information reveals whether cer- tain ecosystem services have values that are currently unknown. (Note that some analysts place option value as a subset of non-use value ratherthan of use value, but they do not otherwise treat it differently.) Thiscategory of benefits includes provisioning, regulating, and cultural ser-vices to the extent that they are not used now but may be used in thefuture. Non-use values are also usually known as existence value (or, some- times, conservation value or passive use value). Humans ascribe value to knowing that a resource exists, even if they never use that resource di- rectly. This is an area of partial overlap with the non-utilitarian sources ofvalue discussed later in this chapter. The utilitarian paradigm itself has no notion of intrinsic value. However, many people do believe that ecosys- tems have intrinsic value. To the extent that they do, this would be par-tially reflected in the existence value they place on that ecosystem, and so MA_CF-127-147.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:16 AM 133134 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment would be included in an assessment of its total economic value under the utilitarian approach. This kind of value is the hardest, and the most con- troversial, to estimate. Economic Valuation Methods Under the utilitarian approach, numerous methodologies have been de- veloped to attempt to quantify the benefits of different ecosystem services (Hufschmidt man III 1993; Dixon et al. 1994). As in the case of private market goods,a common feature of all methods of economic valuation of ecosystem ser- vices is that they are founded in the theoretical axioms and principles of welfare economics. These measures of welfare change are reflected inpeople's willingness to pay (WTP) or willingness to accept (WTA) com- pensation for changes in their level of use of a particular good or bundle of goods (Hanemann 1991; Shogren and Hayes 1997). Although WTP andWTA are often treated as interchangeable, there are important concep- tual and empirical differences between them. Broadly speaking, WTP is appropriate when beneficiaries do not own the resource providing the ser-vice or when service levels are being increased, while WTA is appropriate when beneficiaries own the resource providing the service or when service levels are being reduced. In practice, WTA estimates tend to be substan-tially higher than WTP estimates. For this reason, WTP estimates are often used, as they are more conservative. The methods commonly used to estimate the value of various services are shown in Figure 6.1. A number of factors and conditions determine the choice of measurement method. For instance, when an ecosystem ser- vice is privately owned and traded in the market, its users have the oppor-tunity to reveal their preferences for such a good compared with other substitutes or complementary commodities through their actual market choices, given relative prices and other economic factors. For such ecosys-tem services, a demand curve can be directly specified based on observed market behavior. Many ecosystem services are not privately owned or traded, however, and hence their demand curves cannot be directly ob-served and measured. Alternative methods have been used to derive val- ues in these cases. Different users and authors often classify the various methods of measuring ecosystem services values differently, but the group-ing and naming systems converge to a broad classification that basically depends on whether the measures are based on observed or hypothetical behavior. MA_CF-127-147.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:16 AM 134Concepts of Ecosystem Value and Valuation Approaches 135 The standard valuation approach that uses actual observed behavior data is further divided into direct and indirect observed behavior meth-ods. (See Box 6.1.) When they can be applied, these are generally consid- ered preferable to measures based on hypothetical behavior. The second valuation approach uses measures of economic value based on hypothetical behavior. In this category of methods, people's responses to direct questions describing hypothetical markets or situations are used to infer value. This group can also be divided into direct hypothetical(such as contingent valuation, in which respondents are asked directly how much they would be willing to pay for specified benefits) and indirect hypothetical measures of WTP or WTA (contingent ranking or conjointvaluation, which ask respondents to rank different bundles of goods). A final category of approach is known as benefits transfer. This is not a methodology per se but rather the use of estimates obtained (by whatevermethod) in one context to estimate values in a different context. For ex- ample, an estimate of the benefit obtained by tourists viewing wildlife in one park might be used to estimate the benefit obtained from viewingBOX 6.1 Valuation of Economic Services Through Observed Behavior \u0084Direct observed behavior methods. These methods derive estimates of value from the observed behavior of producers and consumers. They often use marketprices and are most often applicable in cases where the ecosystem services are privately owned and traded in functioning markets. This approach is most frequently applicable to consumptive use, where goods are extracted fromecosystems and traded on markets. \u0084Indirect observed behavior methods. This category also uses actual observed behavior data but not on the ecosystem service in question. In the absence of actual market behavior regarding that particular service, these methods use observations on actual behavior in a surrogate market, which is hypothesizedto have a direct relationship with the ecosystem service value. Examples in this category include hedonic pricing methods (which use statistical tech- niques to break down the price paid for a service into the implicit prices foreach of its attributes, including environmental attributes such as access to recreation or clean air) and travel cost methods (which use observed costs to travel to a destination to derive demand functions for that destination). Thisgroup also includes cost-based methods (such as replacement cost methods, which value services at the cost of replacing, for example, a water purification service provided by an ecosystem with a new water treatment plant) that donot exactly reflect welfare (benefit-based) measures of value. (They sometimes underestimate and sometimes overestimate value.) MA_CF-127-147.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:16 AM 135136 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment wildlife in a different park. Benefits transfer has been the subject of con- siderable controversy in the economics literature, as it has often been used inappropriately. A consensus seems to be emerging that benefits transfer can provide valid and reliable estimates under certain conditions. Theseinclude that the commodity or service being valued is identical at the site where the estimates were made and the site where they are applied and that the populations affected have identical characteristics. Of course, theoriginal estimates being transferred must themselves be reliable for any attempt at transfer to be meaningful. Each of these approaches has seen broad use in recent years, and an extensive literature exists on their application. These techniques can and have been applied to a wide range of issues, including the valuation of cultural benefits (Pagiola 1996; Navrud and Ready 2002). In general, moredirect measures are preferred to indirect ones. However, the choice of valu- ation technique in any given instance will be dictated by the characteris- tics of the case and by data availability. Several techniques have been specifically developed to cater to the characteristics of particular problems. The travel cost method, for example, was developed to measure the utility derived by visitors to sites such asprotected areas. The change in productivity approach, on the other hand, is quite broadly applicable to a wide range of issues. Contingent valuation is potentially applicable to any issue, simply by phrasing the questionsappropriately, and as such has become widely used\u2014probably excessively so, as it is easy to misapply and, being based on hypothetical behavior, is inherently less reliable. Data availability is a frequent constraint and oftenrestricts the choice of approach. Hedonic price techniques, for instance, require vast amounts of data, thus limiting their applicability. Putting Economic Valuation into Practice Whichever method is used for valuing a service, the analysis must begin by framing appropriately the question to be answered. In most policy- relevant cases, the concern is over changes in the level and mix of services provided by an ecosystem. At any given time, an ecosystem provides aspecific \"flow\" of services, depending on the type of ecosystem, its condi- tion (the \"stock\" of the resource), how it is managed, and its socioeco- nomic context. A change in management (whether negative, such as de-forestation, or positive, such as an improvement in logging practices) will change the condition of the ecosystem and hence the flow of benefits it is capable of generating. It is rare for all ecosystem services to be lost en-tirely; a forested watershed that is logged and converted to agriculture, for MA_CF-127-147.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:16 AM 136Concepts of Ecosystem Value and Valuation Approaches 137 example, may still provide a mix of provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural services, even though both the mix and the magnitude of specific services will have changed. Consequently, an assessment of the change in the value of services resulting from a given change in ecosystemmanagement typically is most relevant to decision-makers and policy- makers. Where the change does involve the complete elimination of eco- system services, such as the conversion of an ecosystem through urbanexpansion or road-building, then the change in value would equal the total economic value of the services provided by the ecosystem. (Measure- ments of total economic value of the services from a particular ecosystemcan also be useful to policy-makers as an economic indicator, just as mea- sures of gross national product or genuine savings provide policy-relevant information on the state of the economy.) An assessment of the change in value of ecosystem services can be achieved either by explicitly estimating the change in value or by sepa- rately estimating the value of ecosystem services under the current andthe alternative management regime and then comparing them. If the loss of a given service is irreversible, then the loss of the option value of that service will also be included. (An important caveat here is that the appro-priate comparison is between the ecosystem with and without the man- agement change; this is not the same as a comparison of the ecosystem before and after the management change, as many other factors will usu-ally also have changed.) The typical question being asked, then, is whether the total value of the mix of services provided by an ecosystem managed in one way is greater or smaller then the total value of the mix provided bythat ecosystem managed in another way. The actual change in the value of the benefits can be expressed either as a change in the value of the annual flow of benefits, if these flows arerelatively constant, or as a change in the present value of all future flows. The latter is equivalent to the change in the capital value of the ecosys- tem and is particularly useful when future flows are likely to vary substan-tially over time. (It is important to bear in mind that the capital value of the ecosystem is not separate and additional to the value of the flows of benefits it generates; rather, the two are intimately linked in that the capi-tal value is the present value of all future flows of benefits.) Estimating the change in the value of the flow of benefits provided by an ecosystem begins by estimating the change in the physical flow of ben-efits. This is illustrated in Figure 6.2 for a hypothetical case of deforesta- tion that affects the water services provided by a forest ecosystem. MA_CF-127-147.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:16 AM 137138 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment The bulk of the work involved in the exercise actually concerns quan- tifying the biophysical relationships. In many cases, this requires tracing through and quantifying a chain of causality. Thus, valuing the change inproduction of irrigated agriculture resulting from deforestation requires estimating the impact of deforestation on hydrological flows, determining how changes in water flows affect the availability of water to irrigation,and then estimating how changes in water availability affects agricultural production. Only at the end of this chain does valuation in the strict sense occur\u2014when putting a value on the change in agricultural production,which in this instance is likely to be quite simple, as it is based on ob- served prices of crops and agricultural inputs. The change in value result- ing from deforestation then requires summing across all the impacts. Clearly, following through a chain like this requires close collabora- tion between experts in different disciplines\u2014in this example, between foresters, hydrologists, water engineers, and agronomists as well as econo-mists. It is a common problem in valuation that information is only avail- able on some of the links in the chain, and often in incompatible units. The MA can make a major contribution by helping the various disciplinesinvolved to become more aware of what is needed to ensure that their work can be combined with that of others to allow a full analysis of such problems. In bringing the various strands of the analysis together, there are many possible pitfalls to be wary of. Inevitably, some types of value will prove impossible to estimate using any of the available techniques, either be-FIGURE 6.2 Valuing the Impact of Ecosystem Change Source: Adapted from Pagiola et al. in press. MA_CF-127-147.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 138Concepts of Ecosystem Value and Valuation Approaches 139 cause of lack of data or because of the difficulty of extracting the desired information from them. To this extent, estimates of value will be underes- timates. Conversely, there is an opposite danger that benefits (even if ac- curately measured) might be double-counted. As needed, the analysis can be carried out either from the perspective of society as a whole (\"social\" analysis) or from that of individual groups within society (\"private\" analysis). Focusing on a particular group usuallyrequires focusing on a subset of the benefits provided by an ecosystem, as that group may receive some benefits but not others. (Groups located within an ecosystem, for example, typically receive most of the direct use benefitsbut few of the indirect use benefits, whereas the opposite applies to down- stream users.) It will often also require using estimates of value specific to that group; the value of additional water, for example, will be differentdepending on whether it is used for human consumption or for irrigation. The analysis can thus allow distributional impacts and equity consider- ations to be taken into account, as well as overall welfare impacts on soci-ety as a whole. This type of disaggregation is also useful in understanding the incentives that particular groups face in making their ecosystem man- agement decisions. Many ecosystems are mismanaged, from a social per-spective, precisely because most groups that make decisions about man- agement perceive only a subset of the benefits the ecosystem provides. Similarly, estimating the impact of changes in management on future flows of benefits allows for intergenerational considerations to be taken into account. Here, too, the bulk of the work involved concerns predict- ing the change in future physical flows; the actual valuation in the nar-row sense forms only a small part of the work. Predicting the value that future generations will place on a given service is obviously difficult. Technical, cultural, or other changes could result in the value currentlyplaced on a service either increasing or decreasing. Often, the best that can be done is to simply assume that current values will remain un- changed. If trends suggest that a particular change in values will occur,that can be easily included in the analysis. Such predictions are notori- ously unreliable, however. Non-utilitarian Value From the perspective of many ethical, religious, and cultural points of view,ecosystems are valued even if they do not contribute directly to human well-being. Some ecosystems may be vital to a people's identity as a dis-tinct society or culture. Thus preserving the health of such ecosystems MA_CF-127-147.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 139140 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment may be a necessary condition for measuring changes in the collective wel- fare of those societies and cultures. Further, to the extent that a society's or a culture's ecocentric philosophical and ethical views recognize the in- trinsic value of nonhuman species and ecosystems, sociocultural value also reaches beyond human welfare considerations. Sociocultural Values For many people, ecosystems are closely associated with deeply held historical, national, ethical, religious, and spiritual values. A particularmountain, forest, or watershed may, for example, have been the site of an important event in their past, the home or shrine of a deity, the place of a moment of moral transformation, or the embodiment of national ideals.These are some of the kind of values that the MA recognizes as the cultural services of ecosystems. And to some extent they are captured by utilitarian methods of valuation. But to the extent that some ecosystems are essentialto a peoples' very identity, they are not fully captured by such techniques. These values fall between the utilitarian and intrinsic value paradigms. They might be elicited by using, for example, techniques of participatoryassessment (Campell and Luckert 2002) or group valuation (Jacobs 1997; Wilson and Howarth 2002). This evolving set of techniques is founded on the assumption that the valuation of ecological goods and services shouldresult from a process of open public deliberation, not from the aggregation of separately measured individual preferences. Using this approach, small groups of citizens are brought together in a moderated forum to deliberateabout the economic value of ecosystem goods or services (Wilson and Howarth 2002). The end result is a deliberative or \"group\" contingent valuation (CV) process (Jacobs 1997; Sagoff 1998). With a group CV , theexplicit goal is to derive an economic value for the ecological good or service in question. The valuation exercise is conducted in a manner very similar to a conventional CV survey\u2014using hypothetical scenarios andpayment vehicles\u2014with the key difference being that value elicitation is not done through private questioning but through group discussion and consensus building. The Intrinsic Value Paradigm Although the notion that nature has intrinsic value is a familiar one in many religions and cultures, it is unfamiliar in the context of modern ra- tional choice theory and economic valuation. Yet analysts do have a well-established and familiar metric for assessing the intrinsic value of human beings and their various aspects. This valuation method and its metric MA_CF-127-147.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 140Concepts of Ecosystem Value and Valuation Approaches 141 may then be extended to some nonhuman natural entities, including eco- systems. The notion that ecosystems have intrinsic value is based on a variety of points of view. Intrinsic value is a basic and general concept that isfounded upon many and diverse cultural and religious worldviews. Among these are indigenous North and South American, African, and Australian cultural worldviews, as well as the major religious traditions of Europe, theMiddle East, and Asia. In the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition of religions, human beings are alleged to be created in the image of God. On that basis, humans areattributed intrinsic value. The Bible also represents God as having created plant and animal species, and declares the things thus created to be \"good.\" Some commentators have argued that in doing so, God attributes intrin-sic value to them, and thus that plant and animal species and the other aspects of nature that God also declared to be good have intrinsic value by an act of divine fiat (Barr 1972; Zaidi 1981; Ehrenfeld and Bently 1985). In some American Indian cultural worldviews, animals, plants, and other aspects of nature are conceived as relatives, born of one universal Mother Earth and Father Sky (Hughes 1983). Thus they have the samevalue as human relatives: intrinsic value\u2014if not in name, then at least in pragmatic effect. You may not sell your mother at any price; even perform- ing a hypothetical economic valuation of your mother is questionable.And so, some American Indian elders have argued, neither should hu- mans sell Mother Earth\u2014that is, their tribal lands\u2014or even compromise the intrinsic value of Earth by carrying out an economic valuation of triballands (Gill 1987). Examples of other religious worldviews supporting the concept of in- trinsic value in nature abound. Basic to Hindu religious belief is the essen-tial oneness of all being, Brahman, which lies at the core of all natural things. The presence of Brahman in all natural things is the Hindu basis of intrinsic value (Deutch 1970). Closely related to this idea is the moralimperative of ahimsa, non-injury, extended to all living beings. The con- cept of ahimsa is also central to the Jain environmental ethic (Chapple 1986). Buddhism incorporates ahimsa as a central moral imperative as well (Chapple 1986). Also central to Buddhism is the overcoming of suffering by the cessation of desire. Absent desire, the natural world ceases to be referenced to a person as a pool of resources existing to satisfy desires orpreferences (Kalupahana 1985). The enlightened Buddhist is thus able to appreciate the intrinsic value of nature. MA_CF-127-147.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 141142 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment Taoism, a major philosophical and religious tradition of China, posits the Ta o or Way of nature as a norm of human action (Tu 1985). Taoism regards human economies as a subset of the economy of nature. In the Japanese Shinto religious tradition, the kami (gods), are closely associated with various aspects of nature (Odin 1991). As the kami have a greater- than-human dignity, the aspects of nature with which they are associated are also thought to have intrinsic value. In the Dreamtime narratives ofthe peoples indigenous to Australia, various features of the landscape are the places where the totemic Ancestors performed \"terraforming\" deeds (Stanner 1979). Such places are sacred and, in effect, have intrinsic value. These are but a few of the bases for intrinsic value in non-western religious and cultural worldviews (for a comprehensive summary, see Callicott 1994). It is important for decision-makers to assess empiricallythe actual ecosystem-oriented values\u2014intrinsic, sociocultural, and eco- logical, as well as utilitarian\u2014of those affected by ecosystem-oriented policy and decisions. The two main traditions of modern secular ethics in western culture are utilitarianism and Kantianism. In classical utilitarianism, aggregate \"happiness,\" understood as a greater balance of pleasure over pain, was theputative goal of social policy. Contemporary economics is derived from utilitarianism and posits \"preference satisfaction\" as the goal of rational choice (Sen 1987). If aggregate preference satisfaction is, correspondingly,the goal of social policy, this may sometimes be maximized at the cost of overriding the interests of a comparatively few individuals (Rawls 1971). The potential injustices of unbridled utilitarianism are checked by theassertion of individual rights\u2014most basically to life, liberty, and property. Economic valuation of ecosystem services has been variously criticized by different commentators (e.g., Bromley 1990; Costanza 2000; Heal 2000a;Heal 2000b; Ludwig 2000; Pritchard et al. 2000). Further, reducing all values to preferences has been contested (Sagoff 1988). A person may prefer chocolate to vanilla ice cream, but some find it demeaning to theintrinsic value of human life and human liberty to say that as a society humans collectively prefer not to stage gladiator shows or own slaves or that, as an individual, a person merely prefers honesty over perfidy or jus-tice over treachery. The counter-utilitarian idea that there is a difference between prefer- ences and values and that considerations of individual rights tempers calcu-lations of aggregate utility was most clearly and powerfully expressed by Kant, who wrote, \"Everything has either a price or a dignity . Whatever has a price can be replaced by something else as its equivalent; on the other hand, what- MA_CF-127-147.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:37 PM 142Concepts of Ecosystem Value and Valuation Approaches 143 ever is above all price, and therefore admits of no equivalent, has a dignity. But that which constitutes the condition under which alone something can be an end in itself does not have mere relative worth, i.e., a price, but an intrinsic worth, i.e., a dignity\" (Kant 1959 [1785]:53, italics in original). Because human rights, based on the dignity and intrinsic value of hu- man beings, has traditionally been used to check the excesses and poten- tial injustices of calculations of aggregate utility, many non-anthropocentricethical theorists have largely adopted the intrinsic value paradigm. They first extended it to cover various nonhuman animals (Regan 1983). Some have attempted to push this line of argument further, to argue that allorganisms have interests, goods of their own, natural goals, developments, and fulfillments and so should be accorded intrinsic value (Taylor 1986). Based on the seminal work of Aldo Leopold (1949), others have arguedthat transorganismic levels of biological organization (species, biotic com- munities, ecosystems) also have intrinsic value (Callicott 1989; Rolston III 1994). On whatever basis, intrinsic value has been attributed to vari-ous aspects of nature (genes, organisms, populations, species, evolution- arily significant units, biotic communities, ecosystems) and to nature as a whole (the biosphere). The basis on which intrinsic value is attributed to various entities may limit which ones can have intrinsic value. For example, if being rational is the property required for something to have intrinsic value, then onlyrational beings (effectively, only human beings) are recognized to be in- trinsically valuable. Non-anthropocentric theorists who have posited the criterion of \"having interests\" for ascribing intrinsic value thus limit it toindividual organisms. In traditional Judeo-Christian thinking, those who thought that intrinsic value should be based on the property of being cre- ated in the image of God also effectively limit intrinsic value to humanbeings. In the Dreamtime worldview of the peoples indigenous to Austra- lia, although landscape-level features have intrinsic value, individual plants and animals usually do not (except those associated with a person's owntotem). Aldo Leopold (1949) thought that the things deserving of human \"love and respect\" had intrinsic value. Theoretically someone can love and respect anything at all, but Leopold argued that among other things,\"biotic communities\" commended themselves to human capacity for love and respect. The Interactions of Political and Market Metrics Parallel to using the market or its surrogates to measure economic value, in democratic societies the modern social domain for the ascription of MA_CF-127-147.pmd 7/11/2003, 12:37 PM 143144 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment intrinsic value is the parliament or legislature (Sagoff 1988). In other so- cieties a sovereign power ascribes intrinsic value, although this may less accurately reflect the actual values of citizens than parliamentary or legis- lative acts and regulations do. The metric for assessing intrinsic value isthe severity of the social and legal consequences for violating laws prohib- iting a market in or otherwise compromising that which is recognized to be intrinsically valuable. In western societies long influenced by the Judeo-Christian worldview and Kantian moral philosophy, the highest intrinsic value is attributed to human life. Thus the severest of consequences are prescribed for murdering human beings. Each kind of value\u2014utilitarian, ecological, sociocultural, and intrin- sic\u2014is played out on a common and not always level playing field. Thus the various kinds of value intersect and interact in various ways. One com-mon effect of socially recognizing and legally institutionalizing something's intrinsic value is to take it off the open market, to insist that it has a dignity and therefore should have no price. The clearest and most obviousexample is human beings themselves. In most modern societies, there is no legal market in human beings; there is no open slave market. With the advent of human organ transplants, some societies have decided that thereshould be no legal market in human organs either; these are, by implica- tion, thus accorded intrinsic value. A black market often emerges in entities that are sufficiently well rec- ognized as having a dignity to register a signal in the political intrinsic value metric. Depending on the strength of that signal\u2014for instance, the social and legal consequences of pricing and trafficking in that entity\u2014the supply of such entities declines and the price rises. So one effect of the political intrinsic value metric on the market metric is analogous to the effect of an excise tax or tariff. Some things may arguably have both a dignity and a price\u2014human labor, for example. Society may protect the recognized intrinsic value of things that also have utility by assuring, among other things, that theirprice is right. This may be the ethical rationale for minimum-wage laws, legally mandated health insurance, and retirement benefits in societies that have provided such protections by law. Society may also constrainthe use of human labor with regulations designed to protect workers' health and safety. Laws and regulations recognizing the intrinsic value of such things as endangered species, biodiversity more generally, and ecosystems such as wetlands have created a regulatory environment to which market forces are beginning to respond. A legal market in conservation \"credits\" is emerg- MA_CF-127-147.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 144Concepts of Ecosystem Value and Valuation Approaches 145 ing. The red-cockaded woodpecker, for example, is a \"listed\" species pro- tected by the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA), administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). An agreement between Interna- tional Paper (IP) and the FWS permits the company to consolidate at onelocation the breeding pairs of red-cockaded woodpeckers on its properties in several southeastern states and intensively manage that location as habi- tat for the endangered species. The agreement permits IP to harvest tim-ber on the vacated sites and to sell credits to other owners of red-cockaded woodpecker habitat as the species recovers and the number of breeding pairs increases beyond a specified threshold (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Ser-vice 1999). Similarly, a company wishing to convert a wetland to a shop- ping mall faces regulatory constraints prohibiting wetland destruction. It can comply with those constraints by purchasing a credit from a distantlandowner whose property contains a comparable wetland that will be protected (Fernandez 1999). This provides a market incentive to wetlands owners to conserve them. Another effect of the political intrinsic value metric on the market metric is to shift the burden of proof away from those who would protect something with socially recognized and legally sanctioned intrinsic valueand toward those who would commercially exploit it. The debate about human embryonic stem-cell research in the United States is a case in point. As aspects of human being, human embryonic stem cells are alleged tohave a dignity and therefore should not be commercially exploited by the pharmaceutical industry, some have argued (with ambiguous political suc- cess). To overcome this argument, the pharmaceutical industry and itsscientific allies must successfully counterargue that the aggregate utility of human embryonic stem-cell research is so great as to warrant overriding the putative dignity of this aspect of human being (Orkin and Morrison2002). Just because something has publicly recognized intrinsic value does not mean that its value is absolute or inviolable. Even human beings can be\"converted\" in deference to other values. Soldiers, for example, are often placed in harm's way to advance a country's perceived national interests or even aggregate economic welfare. In such cases, the intrinsic value ofhuman beings seems sacrificed in favor of other values. But when intrinsic values are in zero-sum conflict with utilitarian values, the burden of proof rests with those advocating the latter. Perhaps the most interesting and relevant case in point of legislative ascription of intrinsic value to some aspect of nature\u2014and of the meeting of utilitarian and intrinsic value metrics\u2014is the U.S. Endangered Species MA_CF-127-147.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 145146 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment Act enacted in 1973. In giving absolute legal protection to listed endan- gered species, the ESA, in effect, gave them a dignity comparable in strength to the dignity accorded individual human life. As noted, even the dignity of human life can be legally overridden, but the burden of proof falls onthose who would do so. The ESA was amended in 1978 to create a Cabi- net-level Endangered Species Committee empowered to decide whether opportunity cost (measured on the market metric) of protecting a listedspecies was high enough to warrant overriding its dignity (measured on the political metric). This interaction between the political metric of intrinsic value and the market metric (and its surrogates) of utilitarian value has an analog in economic valuation called the safe minimum standard (SMS). Approach- ing the task of economically valuing ecosystem services by means of theSMS is practically equivalent to socially recognizing their intrinsic value and protecting them by law. Whereas benefit-cost analysis approaches each case and builds up a body of evidence about the benefits and costs of pres-ervation, the SMS approach starts with a presumption that the mainte- nance of the healthy functioning of any ecosystem is a positive good (lump- ing together economic, ecological, sociocultural, and intrinsic values). Theempirical economic question is, How high are the opportunity costs of satisfying the SMS? The SMS decision rule is to maintain the ecosystem unless the opportunity costs of doing so are intolerably high. The burdenof proof is thus assigned to the case against maintaining the SMS (Randall 1998). The quantitative threshold to which the opportunity costs must rise to warrant violating the SMS is left as an open empirical question. In prac- tice, such thresholds are set by the political metric. The economic thresh- old for violating the SMS for ecosystem health will depend in part on howsuccessful its advocates are in persuading voters that ecosystems have a dignity\u2014not necessarily instead of, but as well as a price\u2014and should be protected unless the opportunity costs of doing so are intolerably high.The question of how high is high enough will be indicated in part by the strength of laws and regulations enacted to protect ecosystems. In this case, however, the intrinsic value (assessed on the political metric) is aug-mented by the considerable utilitarian value of ecosystem services; their psycho-spiritual utilitarian values; their option, bequest, and existence utili- tarian and ecological and sociocultural values. MA_CF-127-147.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 146Concepts of Ecosystem Value and Valuation Approaches 147 Conclusion Human societies face important choices in how they manage ecosystems, affecting their conditions and the services they provide and thus ultimately human well-being. How decisions are made will depend on the systems of value endorsed in each society, the conceptual tools and methods at theirdisposal, and the information available. Making the appropriate choices requires, among other things, reliable information on actual conditions and trends of ecosystems and on the economic, political, social, and cul-tural consequences of alternative courses of action. The MA will provide decision-makers with relevant information to aid them in making appropriate ecosystem management decisions. Theimpact that these decisions will have on human well-being is of particular interest. In some cases, these impacts can be assessed with indicators, such as the impact on human health. When there are multiple impacts andwell-being is affected in many different ways, however, such unidimen- sional indicators will not be sufficient. In these cases, economic valuation will provide an important tool, as it will allow for different impacts to becompared and aggregated. Of course, the importance of ecosystems goes beyond their role for human well-being. Non-utilitarian sources of value must also be takeninto consideration in order to make appropriate management decisions. MA_CF-127-147.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:17 AM 1477Analytical Approaches EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \u0084The overall analytical approach to be used to achieve the goals of the Millen- nium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) has nine major tasks: identifying and cat-egorizing ecosystems and their services; identifying links between humansocieties and ecosystem services; identifying the direct and indirect drivers ofchange; selecting indicators of ecosystem conditions, services, human well-being, and drivers; assessing historical trends and the current state of ecosys-tems, services, and drivers; evaluating the impact of a change in services onhuman well-being; developing scenarios of ecosystems, services, and drivers;evaluating response options to deal with ecosystem changes and human well-being; and analyzing and communicating the uncertainty of assessment find-ings. \u0084The MA will rely on five major categories of data and indicators: core data sets(shared among all MA Working Groups), data and indicators for assessmentreports (closely targeted to individual analyses), indicators for summary andsynthesis reports (a smaller set of clear, policy-relevant indicators), new datasets (developed during the MA process for continued use), and metadata (datadocumenting all of these data sets). \u0084Although new synoptic data sets (for example, from remote sensing) enablemore comprehensive global assessments, they nevertheless have deficien-cies that need to be addressed. These include incomplete and inconsistentspatial and temporal data coverage, contradictory definitions of types of data,and the mismatch of ecological, geographic, and political boundaries. Someof these deficiencies will be addressed when the MA acts to assure the qualityof data used in the assessment. Various steps could be taken for data qualityassurance, such as setting up a data archive, sponsoring the development ofMA data sets, or using data already described in the scientific literature. \u0084Models will play an integrative role in the MA and will complement datacollection and analysis. Modeling will be used to analyze interactions amongprocesses, fill data gaps, identify regions for priority data collection, and syn-thesize existing observations into appropriate indicators. \u0084The MA will develop four or five scenarios of medium- to long-term changesin ecosystems, services, and drivers. The scenarios will have an explicitly eco-logical perspective and will explore such themes as ecological surprises andcross-scale ecological feedbacks. They will build on the social and economicinformation contained in existing global scenarios. 148 MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:15 AM 148Analytical Approaches 149 \u0084Scientists must make every effort to estimate the certainty of important find- ings. They must then distinguish and communicate which findings are robust,which are partially understood, and which are uncertain or even speculative.As a rule, uncertainties from all aspects of an assessment should be reportedin a consistent and transparent way. Introduction The analytical approach used to achieve the goals of the Millennium Eco- system Assessment (MA) must be suitable to the many disciplines in- volved in the MA and address the MA conceptual framework, synthesiz-ing the state of knowledge concerning the impact of ecosystem changes on human well-being. The management, analysis, and interpretation of information are key issues because of their relevance to maintaining highscientific standards in the assessment and because they can facilitate the accessibility and usefulness of MA results. Moreover, the effective man- agement of information is a vital requirement for providing a scientificrecord of a comprehensive global assessment of the world's ecosystems. There are nine major tasks in the analytical approach of the MA. (See Figure 7.1.) Note that few arrows are shown in Figure 7.1 to emphasize FIGURE 7.1 The Analytical Approach of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and Its Main Tasks MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:15 AM 149150 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment that many of the activities will be carried out simultaneously rather than in sequence, although at some junctures information will feed in from one task to another. \u0084Identify and categorize ecosystems and their attendant services. To facilitate the assessment of complex ecosystems, the MA will classify them into alimited number of categories as a basis for assessing the services theyprovide. Ecosystem services are identified and grouped into functionalcategories: provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting. (See Chap-ter 2.) \u0084Identify links between services and human societies. Here the links are de- scribed between human societies and the particular ecosystem servicesthat they use or benefit from. This includes defining the components ofhuman well-being that are affected by the services (such as health, live- lihood, culture, and equity), as well as the human activities that in turn affect ecosystems and the supply of services (such as population growth,consumption, and governance). (See Chapter 3.) \u0084Identify indirect and direct drivers. In this task a list of indirect and direct drivers of the state of ecosystems and their services is drafted. Indirect and direct drivers affect not only ecosystems and their services but alsoeach other. For example, demographic changes (an indirect driver) canaffect ecosystems though land use change (a direct driver) but also caninfluence other indirect drivers such as social values and institutions.(See Chapter 4.) \u0084Select indicators of ecosystem conditions, services, human well-being, anddrivers. A set of indicators is selected to assess the state of ecosystems, ecosystem services, human well-being, and drivers. As an example, ifthe ecosystem service is food provision, then a potential indicator for the ecosystem state would be area under cultivation; for the service, quantity of food produced; for human well-being, rates of malnutrition;and for drivers, population growth. Next, these indicators are quanti-fied or otherwise evaluated for use in the other analytical tasks. (SeeChapters 2, 3, and 4.) \u0084Assess historical trends and the current state of ecosystems and their servicesand drivers. The current state of ecosystems and their services is as- sessed by assembling and analyzing data on the indicators selected. Thedetails of how these data will be analyzed have not been completelyworked out, but some considerations are discussed in Chapter 2. Since ecosystems are dynamic, an important issue to be addressed is the mean- ing of \"current conditions.\" In some cases this will refer to the most MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:15 AM 150Analytical Approaches 151 recent data collected, but for most ecosystems it must take into account year-to-year and perhaps inter-decadal variability. (For example, it isnot useful to refer to the availability of fresh water for a particular yearbecause of its strong year-to-year variability.) \u0084Evaluate impact on human well-being. This is among the most challeng- ing tasks in the MA, since it involves the translation of informationlargely from the natural sciences (such as the state of fresh water, soil,and forests) into variables of concern to society (health, livelihoods,wealth, and security, for instance). One challenge is that a given ser-vice can affect several components of human well-being. Another chal- lenge lies in sorting out the many possible trade-offs among services. Finally, the distribution of service benefits among societal groups willneed careful consideration. \u0084Develop scenarios. The MA is concerned not only with the historical, present, and short-term future trends of ecosystems, but also with future trends over the medium and longer term. This information is needed toanticipate critical changes in ecosystems and to develop response strat-egies. The aim of this task is to identify a set of plausible futures or\"scenarios\" for ecosystems, services, and drivers. \u0084Evaluate possible responses. In this task the many possible \"response op- tions\" are identified for preventing the deterioration of ecosystem ser-vices or recovering lost services. This includes evaluating the success ofpast response options and developing guiding principles for designingneeded policies. Consistency is needed between the response strategies identified here and those used in the scenarios. (See Chapter 8.) \u0084Analyze and communicate uncertainty. Since the MA is concerned with a new and rapidly changing body of knowledge, it is clear that many ofthe findings will be uncertain. Assessing and communicating the level of certainty in a clear and consistent manner is therefore a central task of the MA. These nine tasks and Figure 7.1 do not pertain to any particular spatial or temporal scale. Nevertheless, assessments carried out on the sub-global scale might require some refinement of the tasks. For example, in a sub-global assessment the selection of ecosystem categories must take into ac- count the unique conditions of a region, such as its existing biogeographic zones. Another example is the selection of indirect and direct drivers,which should reflect the relevant temporal and spatial scales of the assess- ment, while also taking into account possible external global drivers. As a MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:15 AM 151152 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment general rule, the nine MA tasks described should be adjusted to the par- ticular needs of each sub-global assessment. At the global scale, the MA has distributed these tasks among three Working Groups. The Condition and Trends Working Group is concernedwith the first six tasks, the Scenarios Working Group builds on these to focus on the seventh task, and the Responses Working Group builds on all the earlier tasks to focus on the eighth task. All three Working Groupsare centrally concerned with the analysis and presentation of uncertainty and with incorporating uncertainty into decision-making. The MA Working Groups also focus on distinct time intervals. The Condition and Trends Working Group will assess current conditions and historic trends, typically over the last 40 years. This group will also con- sider issues of sustainability, presenting short-term projections (typicallyover the next 10 years) of changes in ecosystems, ecosystem services, and associated human well-being. The Scenarios Working Group will con- sider plausible futures over the next 25, 50, and 100 years. The ResponsesWorking Group will assess the success of past and current responses and will use these assessments to evaluate available future responses. The conceptual issues surrounding these nine tasks are discussed fur- ther in previous chapters, and the specific methodologies involved in ac- complishing them will be better described and applied in the Working Group reports. The remainder of this chapter describes several of the ma-jor cross-cutting issues in the MA analytical approach: \u0084data, \u0084units of analysis and reporting, \u0084modeling, \u0084scenarios, and \u0084scale and uncertainty. Data A global assessment of world ecosystems and their services obviously re-quires an enormous amount of data. These needs have been summed upinto five broad categories in the MA sub-group report, Core Data Sets and Indicators : \u0084Core data sets. Core data sets are those with wide potential application in the MA. They could cover, for example, land use, land cover, fresh-water resources, marine resources, population, and infrastructure. Es- MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:15 AM 152Analytical Approaches 153 tablishing common core data sets for use by all Working Groups and scientists within the MA will maximize consistency among analyses. Ingeneral, the MA will ensure timely access for all participants to suchcore data sets via an online data archive. Core data sets could be dataalready available or data developed specifically for an assessment. \u0084Data and indicators for assessment reports. Each chapter of the MA will necessarily make extensive use of published data and indicators. In ad-dition, it is likely that some chapters will develop new indicators tomeet their particular needs, recalculate existing indicators based on theagreed-upon core data sets (for example, recalculate a measure of fish production based on an updated marine ecosystem classification), or extend indicators developed for specific regions to the global scale. \u0084Indicators for summary and synthesis reports. Compared with the many indicators used in the full MA reports, only a small number can be included in the Summaries for Decision-makers or the Synthesis Re- ports. These key indicators (perhaps 10-15) either will be selected fromthe larger number or will be compound indicators incorporating severalothers. An enormous weight will fall on these indicators in communi-cating the core MA findings to decision-makers. They must generallybe highly relevant to policy-makers, easily understood, and effectively convey the bottom-line findings concerning the consequences of eco- system change on human well-being. Given the pivotal role these indi-cators will play with respect to the perception and impact of the MAbeyond the scientific community, they will be explicitly identified andtargeted for development. \u0084New data sets. The existence of the MA will probably stimulate the production of new data sets that may be less useful to the MA itself(because of their timing, perhaps, or their resolution) yet would be valu-able for other institutions. These data sets could be helpful, for example,in building the capacity of institutions to undertake their own regional, national, or sub-national integrated assessments of ecosystems and their services. For instance, the United States has promised to provide theMA with complete global terrestrial cover from Landsat 7 for the year2000. Although it is unlikely these data will be fully available in timefor the MA, they will ensure that geo-referenced Landsat data will beavailable at low cost to any country or institution interested in under- taking a more fine-grained analysis of land cover change. \u0084Metadata. For both scientific and technical purposes, it is important to document the data used in the MA (so-called metadata) and to makethe documentation widely available. This need arises in part from the MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:15 AM 153154 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment scientific responsibility to make the work of the assessment transpar- ent, traceable, and reproducible. But there are also reasons of datamanagement, given the breadth and diversity of data used in globalassessments (for instance, gathering sufficient information to define theorigin of the data and assess its reliability). It is becoming more com-mon that software behind, for example, geographic information sys- tems and Web browsers uses standardized metadata descriptions to organize and search for information. Standards for metadata shouldinclude the number and format of data description fields, original datagrain and extent, and the selection of appropriate searchable keywords. To facilitate access to both core data sets and metadata, the MA will establish a data archive. The archive will receive computer support overseveral years and have the appropriate technical characteristics for conve- niently storing and transferring large data sets. Challenges in Using Data There has been a recent proliferation of data sets of differing geographic extent relevant to the work of the MA. They describe the location, ex- tent, and condition of ecosystems, the provision of ecosystem services, and, less frequently, the relationships among drivers and ecosystem ser-vices or among ecosystem services and human well-being. Some of these are based on remote sensing and other relatively recent technologies, while others are from new field programs. These data sets will allow the MA toconduct more rigorous, inclusive, and globally consistent assessments than would have been possible perhaps 10-15 years ago. Nevertheless, the MA faces several difficult issues in using these data effectively. First, the data are incomplete in coverage and are often col- lected by many different researchers who sometimes use incompatible methods. Second, data often have inconsistent spatial scales and time pe-riods, use distinctive definitions and characterization approaches, and are rarely adequately documented, particularly in terms of describing the ac- curacy and reliability of data sets and models. Third, the reality is thatwidely accepted data sets for many important aspects of the world's ecosys- tems are simply not available. For example, land cover derived from differ- ent global data sources (different remote sensing instruments and ground-truthing techniques) often provides conflicting information, none of them match national land use statistics, and time series data of global land cover have never been produced. Perhaps the greatest challenge is that the MA aims to be a global and integrated assessment, yet the available and relevant data continue to be MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:15 AM 154Analytical Approaches 155 of uneven quality in terms of geographic and temporal extent as well as resolution, taxonomy, and economic sector. (For example, crop data are of generally better quality than fisheries or livestock data, which in turn are likely to be better than fuelwood or biodiversity statistics.) Unfortunately,from a geographical perspective, the completeness and reliability of data are often inversely related to the rate of ecosystem change and to levels of human welfare. Data on subjects as varied as species diversity patterns, deforestation rates, invasive plant distributions, human demographic trends, and eco- nomic indicators are often more accessible, of greater reliability, and ofhigher spatial and temporal resolution in richer countries. For example, reliable estimates of crop areas in nearly all counties of the United States can be downloaded from the Internet free of charge, whereas it is some-times difficult to obtain any reliable data for a state or province (much coarser spatial units) in poorer countries where statistical bureaus lack adequate support. At a smaller geographic scale, much of the informationon species distributions, crop yields, resource degradation, and so on is gathered from the most accessible areas near, for example, roads, research stations, and other human centers. The MA will need to carefully accountfor these biases at all scales, and may need to focus many analyses on re- gional and sub-regional case studies where adequate data are available. Another type of bias arises from the tendency of scientists to collect data about \"popular\" taxa such as birds, mammals, butterflies, and trees at the expense of a more balanced coverage for all taxa (although the data coverage of even these popular taxa may suffer from geographic biases).Indeed, these popular taxa can be less important from the standpoint of ecosystem services than neglected groups such as bees, microbes, fungi, and aquatic plants. Not only are the spatial distributions of microbes andother such groups often poorly understood, but their ecological role in relation to ecosystem function and services is also not well documented. As a result, the MA may need to focus on case studies involving well-chosen indicator taxa as proxies and illustrative examples. Other biases also have influenced the type of ecosystem data collected. For example, some types of data tend to be more abundant because theyare easier to measure than others (point source wastewater discharges tend to be better documented in most watersheds, for instance, even though non-point discharges can also have a large influence on the state of waterquality) or because they have a more direct effect on human welfare (for example, more data tend to be available about a river's impact on society during droughts and floods than under less catastrophic circumstances). MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:15 AM 155156 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment Differences in collection periods also present a challenge to data inte- gration and quality. For instance, global initiatives on biodiversity assess- ment and soil degradation present different snapshots in time compiled from local data. While such data have their own quality problems, it is actuallythe change in such factors over time that is central to the concerns of the MA. But analyzing the change in ecosystems over time obviously requires time series data, which are often not available. Consequently, the MA mayhave to rely on only short-term trends, whose temporal resolution may or may not match those of the processes being studied. (See Chapter 5.) The MA's integrated approach requires data on a wide variety of eco- system services, their drivers, and their effects on human welfare. Yet the quality and coverage of these data vary greatly from one service to an- other. An example is the difference in data availability for provisioningversus supporting services of food production. The provisioning services are well described by abundant and relatively reliable data on crop and livestock production and on per capita food consumption. By comparison,the supporting services that make agricultural production possible, such as pollination and climate regulation, are much more poorly described. Nev- ertheless, for the sake of completeness, the MA must attempt to describeall aspects of ecosystem services, even those with poor data coverage. Although current services of an ecosystem can be estimated, the MA must also determine whether these services can be sustained. But it is dif-ficult and sometimes impossible to use current data to estimate the long- term sustainability of an ecosystem. As an example, it is possible to esti- mate the current production of a fishery, but nearly impossible to deducefrom these data whether and for how long this production can be main- tained. Hence we need information on the thresholds of sustainable pro- duction of natural resources. Sometimes this information can be providedby models that simulate the long-term dynamics of an ecosystem, as de- scribed later in this chapter. In addition, assessing the contribution of ecosystem services to human well-being requires data that are usually not available. In particular, infor- mation is lacking on the material resources of individuals, their social re- lations, the state of governance, the role of freedoms and choices, and thestate of equity. Moreover, available data are usually inadequate for analyz- ing temporal trends or for comparing one part of the world with another. Another challenge for the MA is the use of traditional knowledge and undocumented experience. Because this information comes from sources outside of peer-reviewed publications, it needs to be critically assessed by other methods before being used. As an example, sometimes the quality of MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:15 AM 156Analytical Approaches 157 information (say, on the change in abundance over time of a particular plant or animal species) can be cross-checked from more than one source. Another step for controlling its quality would be to publicly archive the source and type of information. Archiving will also ensure that all re-searchers have access to this information. Data Quality Assurance Although quality assurance of data is obviously needed in any global as- sessment of world ecosystems and their services, there are different ways ofachieving this. The method to be used within the MA has to take some special factors into account. First, global assessments typically rely on the voluntary efforts of numerous scientists and experts throughout the world.Second, the coordinators of global assessments normally do not have the capacity to examine carefully all the data sets to be used. In other words, the MA has neither the strong authority nor the capacity to intervene inthe details of data analysis of its scientists. This does not mean that it should give up on quality control. On the contrary, the Intergovernmen- tal Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has shown that de facto qualitycontrol of data can be achieved without a formal quality assurance pro- gram. The following actions have made this possible: \u0084Most data used or cited by the IPCC stem from peer-reviewed scientific publications. It is expected that major deficiencies in data sources wouldbe identified and \"filtered out\" in the course of peer-review. \u0084Some data sets come from large national or international organizations such as the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the Center for International Earth Science Information Networks of Co-lumbia University, or the United Nations Environment Programme(UNEP) World Conservation Monitoring Centre, that have internalprocedures for maintaining quality control. \u0084Some data sets are assembled according to IPCC guidelines (such asemission inventories and estimates of carbon flux to forests). Data qualitycontrol is one of the aims of these guidelines. To assure the quality of the data, the MA will build on the experience of the IPCC and insist on the use of data published in the scientific litera-ture where possible. It will draw on the data of large organizations with their own data-control procedures and sponsor the development of its own data sets, as described earlier. Another step for quality control will be toset up a data archive containing metadata and some full data sets, as men- tioned. This will give assessment coordinators an overview of much of the MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:15 AM 157158 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment data being used in the assessment. Archiving would also help assure the quality of information coming from traditional knowledge and undocu- mented experience, as indicated earlier. Indicator Selection Global assessments of ecosystems and their services by definition involve the handling and evaluation of a huge number and variety of data and themes. It is clear that an assessment is only manageable if experts can focus on a limited number of representative indicators of ecosystems andtheir services. Because of the great weight these indicators hold, they must be carefully chosen. Earlier we described some of the particular types of indicators needed in an MA-type assessment. Here we pose the question,What are the characteristics of a \"good indicator\"? This depends on who is using the indicator and for what purpose, but three characteristics are com- mon to all purposes: representativeness, reliability, and feasibility (Hardiand Zdan 1997; Prescott-Allen 2001). For an indicator to be representative , it must cover the most important aspects of ecosystems and their services. As an example, consider the dif-ferent possible indicators for \"human health.\" \"Life expectancy at birth\" is not a bad indicator because it reflects all the causes of death that a typical person would be exposed to throughout life. \"Healthy life expectancy atbirth\" is an even better indicator, however, because it subtracts the num- ber of years likely to be lost to illness and injury. For an indicator to be representative it must also be a sign of the degree to which an objective of an ecosystem service is met. For example, the indicator \"healthy life expectancy at birth\" shows the extent to which \"having a long life in good health\" has been attained, whereas immuniza-tion rates, health expenditures, and numbers of doctors are indirect indi- cators of this objective. Finally, to be representative, an indicator must illustrate trends in ecosystems and their services over time, as well as dif-ferences between places and groups of people. An indicator is likely to be reliable if it is well founded, accurate, and measured in a standardized way using an established or peer-reviewedmethod and sound and consistent sampling procedures. And an indicator is feasible if it depends on data that are readily available or obtainable at reasonable cost. The quality of potential indicators depends on how well they meet the above criteria. If no indicator can be found that adequately meets all these, then the component should be excluded from an assessment and its exclu-sion clearly noted. MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:15 AM 158Analytical Approaches 159 The choice of components and indicators and their underlying meth- odologies must also be clearly documented. The more rigorous and system- atic the choice of indicators, the more likely an indicator-based assessment will be transparent, consistent, and useful for decision-making. And themore involved decision-makers and stakeholders are in the selection of indicators, the greater will be their acceptance of results of the assessment. But a potential problem needs to be noted here: the time and technicalskills required for selecting indicators might make it difficult for decision- makers and stakeholders to participate fully in the selection of indicators. This could work against the goal of maintaining an open process in theMA. (See Chapter 8.) At the same time, experts carrying out the assess- ment have the responsibility to ensure that the selection of indicators and the assessment as a whole are technically and scientifically sound. Hencein the area of indicators, as in other areas of the MA, a way must be found to maximize both the technical excellence of the assessment and the en- gagement of participants from government, civil society, and industry. Units of Analysis and Reporting Ecosystem Boundaries Because the MA is concerned fundamentally with ecosystems and their functioning, it is necessary to describe these ecosystems and their spatialextent in as consistent a way possible, reflecting the state of scientific un- derstanding. Indeed, many of the tasks described at the beginning of this chapter require an up-to-date characterization and mapping of the world'secosystem types. For example, assessing the current state of ecosystems and their services or evaluating the impact of changes in these services on human well-being requires a consistent global overview of ecosystems. At the most basic level, there are two fundamentally different ecosys- tem classifications: those based on actual ecosystem extent and those based on \"original\" or \"potential\" extent. The first type delineates ecosystemtypes based on their current distributions, including, for example, various agricultural and urban ecosystems developed by people through conver- sion of natural systems. The practical approach to assessing the locationand extent of contemporary ecosystems at the regional scale has been through land cover interpretation of satellite data. For example, the Inter- national Geosphere-Biosphere Programme has identified 17 land covertypes (deciduous broadleaf forest, for example, and cropland) using satel- lite data of 1-kilometer resolution (Belward 1996). These are widely ac- cepted as proxies of aggregate ecosystem types. MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:15 AM 159160 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment Classifications of the second type, based on original or potential eco- system extent, attempt to depict the ecosystems that would occur without human modification\u2014in other words, due to prevailing biotic and abiotic conditions. For example, the World Wide Fund for Nature has developeda global system of 871 terrestrial ecoregions, nested within 14 biomes and 8 biogeographic realms, based largely on patterns of potential natural veg- etation (Olson and Dinerstein 1998). Of course, marine ecosystems pro-vide special problems in defining ecosystem boundaries. Nevertheless, at least two marine classification systems exist, and they provide an estimate of boundaries between biogeochemical provinces and large marine eco-systems in the world's oceans (Longhurst 1991; Sherman and Duda 1999). Ecosystem classifications of both types are likely to be useful to the MA. Current ecosystem data are essential for determining the services that eco-systems provide today as well as for establishing a baseline against which changes in land cover and services will be assessed using scenarios or in future assessments. At the same time, data on the original extent of ecosys-tems places patterns of land use change into ecological context. In fact, comparing the two types of classifications, especially where they differ, can yield insights into the relative extent of conversion of original habitat types. Several issues must be considered. First, because factors defining eco- systems vary continuously in space, the boundaries of any set of ecologi- cally defined units will necessarily represent zones of transition instead ofsharp boundaries. As a result, the precise location of these ecosystem bound- aries should be downplayed, and the meaning of the changes occurring across those lines emphasized. Second, the appropriate ecosystem classification often will depend on the ecosystem service being considered. For example, in a mountainous region, analyses of fresh water would tend to link upland areas via streamand groundwater flow to the rest of the river basin below. Terrestrial analy- ses, in contrast, would link these same upland areas to areas of similar elevation on the other side of the divide, based on similarity of vegetation,fauna, and climate. Third, ecosystem services operate at wide range of characteristic scales. (See Chapter 5.) Matching the scale of ecological assessment (and thusthe units used) to the scale of the service considered will be an important, and often difficult, aspect of the MA's task. Finally, even if ecosystems can be delineated with confidence, ecosys- tem processes and services often transcend local ecological units and bound- aries or involve interactions among them. For example, services provided by mangrove ecosystems (such as water purification, sediment capture, MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:15 AM 160Analytical Approaches 161 and habitat for juvenile fish) will be best maintained by proper manage- ment of both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. In addition, modern trans- portation systems have allowed ecosystems to provide services to people living far away, complicating and broadening the \"ecological footprint\" ofhuman population centers. Recognizing some of these difficulties in describing the location and extent of broad ecological systems, the MA has adopted definitions forsuch systems that allow for overlap in their extents. (See Chapter 2.) Thus areas of forest fragmented by patches opened up for agriculture are dealt with, from a systems perspective, in both the forest systems and the culti-vated systems chapters of the Condition and Trends Reports, while cross- system summary tables control for possible double-counting of the ecosys- tem services provided. Relating Ecological and Human-centered Units An ecosystem's function and its ability to supply services to a particular human population are often best evaluated across its full extent, not only in the political unit in which that population lives. For example, waterquality for a given municipality may depend more on the condition of the upstream portions of the watershed than on the areas within the city lim- its. At the same time, evaluating the importance of these ecosystem ser-vices to human welfare, as well as formulating policy to better manage them, will necessarily be conducted within the context of political units such as counties, cities, or provinces (Balvanera et al. 2001). As a result, the MA conceptual framework will require frequent trans- lation between ecological units and political or other society-centered units, particularly when linking indirect to direct drivers or ecosystem servicesto human well-being. For instance, demographic shifts may be an impor- tant indirect driver of many ecosystem changes, such as deforestation or soil erosion. Analyzing this relationship, however, will require relatingdemographic information collected for political units (such as counties) to ecological data necessarily assembled on ecological units (such as forest types). In addition, relating ecosystem services to human well-being, as inthe water quality example, requires the reverse translation: from ecologi- cal units (watersheds) to political entities (cities). Because ecological and political boundaries rarely overlap exactly, these translations among units are often difficult. For instance, it is hard to at- tribute human population densities collected on a national level to the country's ecosystems accurately. MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:15 AM 161162 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment Reporting Units In order to best inform and assist the various users of MA products, it will be important to report assessment findings in units most relevant to those users. Many findings will be relevant to national and sub-national govern- ments, and thus MA findings need to be reported in a form useful to thesegovernments. In addition, the MA's scope and mandate clearly overlaps with those of existing international organizations and with previous sci- entific assessments (such as the Convention on Biological Diversity andthe Convention to Combat Desertification). Hence, special efforts will be made to report MA findings in terms of the established units and frame- works used by these organizations. Translating MA findings into various reporting units presents many challenges. In particular, the need to summarize the same findings in dif- ferent forms has required careful collection and collation of informationfrom the very start. Modeling Issues Models play an essential role in global assessments of ecosystems and theirservices. They can be used to analyze interactions between processes, fill data gaps, identify regions for data collection priority, or synthesize exist- ing observations together into appropriate indicators of ecosystem services.They also provide the foundations for elaborating scenarios. As a result, models will play a synthesizing and integrative role in the MA, comple- menting the data collection and analysis efforts. It is relevant to note that all models have built-in uncertainties linked to inaccurate or missing input data, weaknesses in driving forces, uncer- tain parameter values, simplified model structure, and other intrinsic modelproperties. One way of dealing with this uncertainty in the MA is to en- courage the use of alternative models for computing the same ecosystem services and then compare model results. Having at least two independentsets of calculations can add confidence in the robustness of the model calculations, although it will not eliminate uncertainty. To summarize the use of models in the MA, we have grouped them into two categories: environmental system models and human system models. The distinction between these two classes is somewhat blurred, however. What we call \"environmental system models\" often contain de-scriptions of some aspects of the human system, and \"human system mod- els\" in turn often include aspects of environmental systems. Within each MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:15 AM 162Analytical Approaches 163 category, we identify some, although by no means all, classes of models that could be used in a global assessment. Environmental System Models A large number of freshwater resource models already exist and are used from local (small catchments), regional (watersheds and river networks),continental (large drainage basins), and global scales (e.g., V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty et al. 1989; Coe 2000; Donner et al. 2002; Alcamo et al. 2003). Included in this general class are the water balance and water transport models thatconsider the flow of water through plants, soil, underground, and storage systems. A new class of integrated water resource models expands these to include water use by society. These models can be used to assess how changesin a given component of the system affect the ability of other parts to provide ecosystem services associated with freshwater systems. New models of marine resources are becoming available that can pro- vide quantitative input to the assessment of ecosystem services provided by the marine environment. A representative of this group is the frame- work of models developed at the Fisheries Centre of the University ofBritish Columbia (Walters et al. 1997; Pauly et al. 1998). Their approach, incorporated in the widely used Ecopath with Ecosim suite of software, is structured around a mass-balance concept that allows a simplified param-eterization of the dynamics of freshwater and marine fisheries. These new models can be used to develop fisheries scenarios constrained by the feed- ing interactions within an ecosystem, thus leading to more realistic sce-narios than the traditional fisheries management approaches, where such constraints are ignored. The modeling framework of the University of Brit- ish Columbia also depicts fishery dynamics on a spatial grid of the world'soceans, thus providing a spatially explicit estimate of changes in the eco- system services associated with the world's marine resources. There are numerous models of terrestrial ecosystem processes that are appropriate for analyses at the local, regional, and global scale (Prentice et al. 1992; Melillo et al. 1993; Alcamo et al. 1994; Foley et al. 1996; Kucharik et al. 2000). Biogeochemistry models describe the flow of energy, water,and nutrients in the biosphere and are used to estimate essential proper- ties such as productivity, carbon storage, and other functional aspects of ecosystems. At a more general level, biogeography models are used to de-scribe patterns of plant distribution with respect to climate and soils and can be used to test the impact of changes in those variables. Land cover models provide insights in land cover change by analyzing the relation-ship between the various drivers of the process; such models are often MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:15 AM 163164 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment spatially explicit and can help in assessing the impact of decisions affect- ing the use of land. Finally, integrated global ecosystem models provide a dynamic framework for studying changes in ecosystem structure and func- tion under changing pressures. These models have largely focused on naturalvegetation systems but are starting to turn to managed ecosystems. A wide variety of climate models exists, and some of them can be used to quantify relationships between ecosystems and climate (Cox et al. 2000;Foley et al. 2000; Wang and Eltahir 2000). In particular, they help in ex- amining both how ecosystems contribute to climate regulation and, con- versely, how changes in climate may affect the capacity of ecosystems toprovide goods and services in the future. General circulation models (GCMs) have been the traditional working tool for climate research, but up to now their linkage with ecosystems has been limited mostly to theirrepresentation of the influence of surface albedo on energy fluxes. Fully coupled climate-biosphere models are extensions of GCMs; they simulate physical and biogeochemical interactions between ecosystems and the cli-mate system. These models, which can be of varying complexity, are more relevant to the MA. For the most part, each genre of environmental models can be applied at various scales\u2014local, regional, continental, and global. Their useful- ness at various scales depends on their capability to capture input data and processes at a resolution that is consistent with processes at play at thosescales. At local scales, models may be used to demonstrate the character- istic dynamics of ecosystems in different geographic areas where observa- tional data are lacking. At regional and continental scales, models canassist in making up for observational data deficiencies and addressing biome- wide issues. At the global scale, models could be used to describe, among other subjects, changes in vegetation cover and biodiversity, linkages be-tween global hydrology and water use, and food and crop production in a changing economic or climatic context. They also provide a standardized method for computing ecosystem indicators everywhere in the world. (Seealso Chapter 5.) Human System Models Social scientists model human behavior at various levels of aggregation, such as at the household level, the sub-national sectoral level, and thenational and international level. Although these models strive toward quantification, purely conceptual models also play an important role in social science thinking and policy decision-making. MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:15 AM 164Analytical Approaches 165 Household models examine the impact of changes in the external en- vironment on production, consumption, and investment decisions. They have been used in particular to analyze differences between households in their access to resources. By comparison, sectoral models describe the vari-ous components of a complete economic sector. Sectoral models are used to address questions about the relationship between external factors and the performance of the sector\u2014for example, anticipating the impact of afalling global wheat price on wheat production in Asia. Recently researchers have begun to apply sectoral models to the question of the impact of a particular economic sector on natural resources, as in the case of the im-pact of agricultural production on the availability of land and water (and vice versa) (e.g., Rosegrant et al. 2002). Some human system models, particularly economic models, are avail- able at the national and international level. They describe either a par- ticular sector (for instance, energy or agriculture) at this level or a group- ing of sectors. A particular class of national and global models is made upof the computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, which trace through economy-wide linkages of changes that are targeted to particular sectors. CGE models have the potential to be used for assessing the consequencesof environmental change, but few examples of such use exist. It should be stressed that the majority of \"human system models\" focus on economic efficiency and the economically optimal use of natural re-sources. Thus the broader issues of human well-being addressed by the MA, including such factors as freedom of choice, security, and health, will require a new generation of models. At a minimum, the present cadre ofmodels needs to be extended to address these critical constituents of hu- man well-being and their links to ecosystem services. Integrated Models There is also a small set of global integrated models that combine descrip- tions of the environmental system with the human system (e.g., Alcamo et al. 1996; Edmonds et al. 1996; Kainuma et al. 2003). These models relate demographic, economic, and technological factors with globalchanges in climate, natural vegetation, agricultural production, water re- sources, and other aspects of the Earth system. Some take into account feedbacks from the environmental system to the human system. Suchmodels can be used in the MA to fill in data gaps in describing the current state of ecosystem services and for generating scenarios of future ecosys- tem services. MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:15 AM 165166 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment Scenario Analysis The MA is concerned not only with assessing the current state and his- torical trends of ecosystems but also with developing medium- and long- term scenarios. This is because decision-making involves not only imme- diate options but also their consequences for the future (Carpenter 2002).Known or potentially long-lasting effects (decades or longer) must be ex- plicitly taken into account in the decision-making process. Of particular relevance are situations where management decisions lead to irreversiblechanges in ecosystem conditions and processes. In these cases the policy decision must be informed by the probability of reaching such an irrevers- ible threshold in the set time frame. Ecology has many methods for anticipating the future of ecosystems (Clark et al. 2000). These include prediction, forecasting, and projecting, each with its own methods for estimating ecological outcomes, probabili-ties, and uncertainties. Ecological forecasts themselves are insufficient for the needs of the MA, however. (See Box 7.1.) Although the MA will use forecasts and other types of model projections where possible, additionalmethods are needed to provide a more comprehensive coverage of future ecological change in a format useful for decision-making. Scenarios are one of those alternatives. Scenarios for Ecological Services The MA will use scenarios to summarize and communicate the diverse trajectories that the world's ecosystems may take in future decades. Sce- narios are plausible alternative futures, each an example of what mighthappen under particular assumptions. They reveal the dynamic processes and causal chains leading to different outcomes of the future (Rotmans et al. 2000). Scenarios can be used as a systematic method for thinkingcreatively about complex, uncertain futures. In this way, they help us to understand the upcoming choices that need to be made and highlight developments in the present (Rotmans et al. 2000). In our case, we areparticularly concerned with scenarios that deal with changes in ecosystem services and their impact on human well-being. The MA Scenarios Working Group will develop scenarios that con- nect possible changes in drivers (which may be unpredictable or uncon- trollable) with human demands for ecosystem services. The scenarios will link these demands, in turn, to the futures of the services themselves andthe aspects of human welfare that depend on them. The scenario building exercise will break new ground in several areas: MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:15 AM 166Analytical Approaches 167 \u0084development of scenarios for global futures linked explicitly to ecosys- tem services and the human consequences of ecosystem change, \u0084consideration of trade-offs among individual ecosystem services withinthe \"bundle\" of benefits that any particular ecosystem potentially pro-vides to society, \u0084assessment of modeling capabilities for linking socioeconomic driversand ecosystem services, and \u0084consideration of ambiguous futures as well as quantifiable uncertainties. Review of Scenario Types and Approaches Scenario analysis was first used for strategic planning during the early cold war period. However, scenarios about long-term sustainability of naturalresource use did not emerge until the 1970s. These studies included the well-known report by Meadows et al. (1972) in which the authors dis- cussed limits to human population growth. Scenarios were also being usedby some businesses at this time, including Royal Dutch/Shell (Wack 1985), that have since become leaders in the field of scenario use for business and other uses.BOX 7.1 Ecological Forecasting While ecological forecasting has had notable success in a limited number of well- studied cases (Clark et al. 2000; Carpenter 2002), scientists' ability to forecast eco- logical change and its probability distributions has important limitations. Often the amount of information available for projecting ecosystem behavior is insufficient.Some particularly large changes in ecosystems occur only infrequently and are there- fore difficult to study, characterize, and predict (Turner and Dale 1998). Other changes are simply random. The dynamics of socioecological systems are especiallychallenging, and most of the systems of interest to the Millennium Ecosystem As- sessment are socioecological ones. Last, many of the current and anticipated changes in ecosystems, and in human use of ecosystems, are new, and there is therefore nohistorical experience on which to base forecasts. For these reasons, the probability distributions of ecological predictions or fore- casts frequently cannot be characterized (Ludwig et al. 2001; Carpenter 2002). Eco-logical forecasts may also have many dimensions or contingencies, which means that a large number of potential outcomes must be considered. The multiplicity, contingency, and complexity of these many potential outcomes may be a barrier tounderstanding that limits the usefulness of the forecasts for decision-makers or the general public. MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:15 AM 167168 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment TABLE 7.1 Overview of Some Global Scenario Projects Name Description Citation Global Scenario Group (GSG) Examines global scenarios based on three classes: conventional worlds, barbarization, and great transitions Gallopin 1997, Raskin et al. 1998, Raskin et al. 2002 Global Environmental Outlook 3 (GEO-3) Similar to GSG, with emphasis on regional texture UNEP 2002 World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Scenarios aimed at helping corporate members reflect on the business risks and opportunities of the sustainable development challenge (FROG!, GEOpolity, and Jazz) WBCSD 1997 World Water Vision (WWV) Three global water scenarios focusing on water supply and demand, including water requirements for ecosystems Cosgrove and Rijsberman 2000, Gallopin and Rijsberman 2000 IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) Greenhouse gas emissions scenarios to the year 2100; axes of change are sustainable to unsustainable, and globally integrated to globally fragmented SRES 2000 Since 1995, there has been widespread use of scenarios to assess the status of the global environment. The MA intends to build on these ex- amples, such as the reports of the Global Scenarios Group, UNEP's Global Environmental Outlook , the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios released by the IPCC, the scenarios of the World Business Council on Sustainable Development, the World Water Vision Scenarios of the World Water Com- mission, and the scenarios computed with the IMAGE model, to explorelong-range dynamics of global environmental change. (See Table 7.1.) In general, scenarios contain a description of step-wise changes, driv- ing forces, base year, time horizon and time steps, and a storyline (Alcamo2001). They are often classified by the method used to develop them, the goals and objectives, or the output. One classification of scenarios dis- criminates between \"exploratory\" and \"anticipatory\" scenarios. Exploratoryscenarios are descriptive: they begin in the present and explore trends into the future. Anticipatory scenarios start with a vision of the future that could be optimistic, pessimistic, or neutral and work backwards in time toimagine how society might reach that future. The MA approach to devel- opment scenarios is likely to be a mixture of exploratory and anticipatory approaches. Scenarios can be built around qualitative information, quantitative in- formation, or a combination of both. Qualitative scenarios include quali- tative information and use a narrative text to convey the main scenariomessages. This can be helpful when presenting information to a nonscien- tific audience. Quantitative scenarios usually rely on models based on quan- MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:16 AM 168Analytical Approaches 169 titative information to calculate future developments and changes; they are presented in the form of graphs and tables (Alcamo 2001). Both sce- nario types can be combined to develop internally consistent storylines based on quantification with models, which are then disseminated in anarrative form. This approach will be used to develop the MA scenarios. That is, we will develop a general qualitative storyline supported by quan- tification. Scenario development will be an iterative process, involvingdevelopment of zero-order storylines, quantification of driving forces and indicators, and revision of the storylines together with various scenario user groups. According to Alcamo (2001), good scenarios fulfill the objectives of the exercise; are sufficiently documented; are plausible; are internally con- sistent; challenge the beliefs and broaden the understanding of readers(experts, policy-makers, and laypeople); and convey complex interactions in the socioecological system. We will attempt to meet these goals through a participatory process that involves dialogue among scenario experts, sci-entists, decision-makers, user communities, and others. The MA Approach to Scenario Analysis At the most general level, the MA scenarios should connect possible changes in drivers with human demands for ecosystem services and, inturn, to the futures of the ecosystem services themselves and the aspects of human welfare that depend on them. This is a complex task. Some of the drivers that might be considered ambiguous and uncon- trollable include governance, economic globalization, climate, or emer- gence of disease. For example, the MA scenarios could consider the impli- cations of increasing interconnectedness of economies at the global scale.How will such global economic changes affect the capacity of ecosystems to produce food and fiber, provide fresh water, and sustain biodiversity? What are the impacts of these ecological changes for the alleviation ofpoverty? And what are the implications for ecosystem services of changes in human welfare? Such feedbacks are at the heart of MA scenarios. The Scenarios Working Group developed the following objectives to guide its scenario-building work: \u0084to illustrate that global changes are connected to ecosystem services at every scale, from global to local, and that these changes have implica- tions for human well-being; Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment \u0084to illustrate the effectiveness of different policies in making ecosystem services available and maintaining these services, including evaluatingthe effectiveness of policies at different scales; and \u0084to fulfill the objectives of scenario users. The objective of the scenario-building exercise can also be summed up by the question, What are the possible co-evolutions of humanity and Earth's ecosystems? Several other more specific questions follow logically from this first one: \u0084How will ecosystem services support human well-being in the future? \u0084What are the major threats to the world's ecosystems? \u0084What are the trade-offs (in space, between current and future use, between ecosystem services, and so on)? \u0084What can be done to harmonize human welfare and production ofecosystem services? \u0084What are the appropriate incentive structures to ensure that ecosys-tems are used wisely? \u0084What are the signatures of different drivers of ecosystem goods andservices and human well-being? \u0084What are the threats and opportunities for provision of ecosystemservices? \u0084What are the appropriate scales for addressing ecosystem services,drivers, and interventions? The current proposal under consideration by the Scenarios Working Group is to develop four or five scenarios. The group first evaluated five \"zero-order\" (very preliminary) scenarios found in previous global scenario exercises. (See Table 7.2.) Although the previous scenarios are detailedand carefully constructed, their focus is largely on social and economic issues. Environmental changes enter into many of them, both directly (for example, in the IPCC scenarios on global climate change) and indirectly(as drivers of societal change, for instance), but the many complex feed- backs that characterize real ecosystems are not explored or tested in detail in any existing global scenario. The MA will approach the construction of global scenarios from an explicitly ecological perspective. That is, we will draw on previous sce- narios but will focus on ecological surprises and cross-scale ecological feed-backs. MA scenarios should address branch points in global dynamics that are related to changes in ecosystem services. For example, how would the MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:16 AM 170Analytical Approaches 171 global system change if ecosystems are more fragile than expected, or more robust than expected? Scenarios will be developed for the global system. Quantitative out- puts of the scenarios will be aggregated from regional data. As with previ-ous global scenarios, a regional breakdown of quantitative outputs will be provided in some cases. Quantification will be accomplished using a com- bination of the models developed for other global scenarios projects, asdescribed in this section. (See Table 7.3.) Indicators will be chosen so that they reflect user needs, integrate in- formation across ecosystem types, connect clearly to human well-being,are compelling, have scientific legitimacy, and are scalable. They should also be useful in estimating the vulnerability of society to changes in eco- system services, including society's ability to cope and adapt to thesechanges. Models to Support Scenario Analysis As noted, part of the MA strategy for scenario analysis calls for the use of models to \"quantify\" the scenarios\u2014that is, to generate quantitative as-pects of the scenarios. For this task a wide range of models will be needed, as large a variety as described earlier for filling in data gaps. Models will be used to \"translate\" the language of the scenarios into quantitative illustrations of changes in ecosystem services.

For ex- ample, changes in climate, land use patterns, and water demand may be fed into watershed models to assess changes in freshwater availability, wa-ter quality, and aquatic habitats. Likewise, changes in forest cover and climate could be used to drive models of habitat loss in order to assess changes in biological diversity. Because the MA is a multiscale assessment, and because the scenarios will be evaluated at multiple scales, modeling will be performed at local, regional, and global scales. At the global scale, gross changes in ecosystemservices may be responding to changes in climate, atmospheric chemistry, and patterns of land use. Such modeling exercises could help pinpoint changes in freshwater availability, crop production, carbon sequestration,and habitat. At regional scales, modeling exercises could help illustrate more detailed outcomes of the scenarios: changes in water flows, agricul- tural systems, disease pathways, and water quality may be addressed atthese scales. Finally, at local scales, questions related to community access to natural resources, as well as the relationships between environmental conditions and human health, may be best addressed. Ultimately, models provide the means of translating the storylines of scenarios into quantitative assessments of changing ecosystem services. The degree of quantification that is performed will likely be somewhatTABLE 7.3 Matching of Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Scenarios with Earlier Scenario Exercises Earlier Exercises Models EGS-1 EGS-2 EGS-3 EGS-4 EGS-5 communalism Fortress world SRES AIM, AIM, WaterGap Globio Markets Sustainability first \u2014 Security first WWV PoleStar, WaterGap IFPRI TEC TEC VAL \u2014 BaU FROG!

Overarching Issues Matters of Scale The issue of scale arises in nearly all aspects of an MA-type of assessment. By the \"scale issue\" we mean the question of whether data analyses and data comparisons correctly take into account the different aggregation levels by which ecosystems can be described. Here we only mention some of the mainpoints of this issue, as Chapter 5 covers these questions more completely. The scale issue is critical to the analytical approach of the MA because ecosystems operate and are measured and observed at different scales. Ateach scale researchers characterize the extent, pressures, conditions, and trends of ecosystem types. For any size patch other than the global scale, there will be a set of factors external to the ecosystem that influence howit functions and, in turn, there will be flows of mass and energy between the patch and the larger scales. On one hand, the larger the scale, the more inclusive the description of mass and energy flows. On the otherhand, the larger the scale, the rougher the description of the ecosystem. Hence part of the scale issue is determining the correct spatial and tempo- ral coverage and resolution to assess ecosystems and their services anddrivers. Other examples of scale issues that must be addressed by the MA include the following: \u0084There needs to be as close a match as possible between the scale used to map ecosystems and the scale required to characterize ecosystem ser- vices. \u0084Ecosystem services themselves are described at different scales. For ex-ample, some services (such as providing fresh water) tend to operate more locally than others (such as climate regulation). The differences in scales must be taken into account in comparing the value of differentecosystem services. \u0084Many scale issues arise when models are used to provide information for an assessment. For example, coarse-scaled output from global cli- mate models may be difficult to apply to local decisions or to use asinput to finer-scaled local vegetation models. \u0084The analysis of response options also raises complex issues of scale. Of- ten the management of natural resources such as forests or fisheries involves many different political and economic actors (local and na- MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:16 AM 173174 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment tional governments, for instance, and local and multinational compa- nies) operating at many different spatial and organizational scales. Review and Validation Procedures The MA assessment reports will undergo two rounds of peer-review in- volving experts and governments. An independent Review Board has also been established to oversee this review process and to ensure that the re- view comments received are handled appropriately by the assessment au-thors. Much of the information contained in the assessment reports will be based on published scientific literature, which in turn has been through a formal process of peer review. However, the MA also seeks to incorpo-rate information from traditional knowledge, practitioners' knowledge, and undocumented experience. This is particularly important in the case of the MA sub-global assessments\u2014particularly the community-scale ones\u2014since much of the information available for these may not be in the form of published scientific articles. Each of the MA sub-global assessments will develop a process to validate unpublished information, including many,if not all, of the following features: \u0084self-critical review notes or reflective diaries\u2014the researcher should record information on his or her own perceptions of where information being recorded may be incomplete, biased, or in error; \u0084triangulation\u2014multiple sources of information should be obtained, par- ticularly for critical pieces of information; \u0084review by communities\u2014where the information involves local or tra-ditional knowledge, members of the community should be given anopportunity to review the findings prior to finalization of the assess-ment; and \u0084review by stakeholders at higher and lower scales\u2014individuals who maynot have detailed local knowledge of the area being assessed, but withknowledge of the region in which the assessment is located, should begiven an opportunity to review the findings prior to finalization of theassessment. In addition, when unpublished information is included in the global MA assessment reports, detailed information concerning the source of the information (such as names of people interviewed, dates and types of notes recorded, the presence or absence of a researcher's self-critical review notes,and other sources of information validating the information) will be made available to the co-chairs of the Working Group. MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:16 AM 174Analytical Approaches 175 Analysis of Uncertainty This section draws heavily on the document developed for handling uncertainty in IPPC assessments (Moss and Schneider 2000). An assessment of the relative credibility of the range of ecosystem con- ditions, processes, and outcomes should be a major goal of assessmentreports. It is important to adopt a consistent approach for assessing, characterizing, and reporting uncertainties. This will help improve com- munication between the research community and decision-makers regard-ing what is known and unknown (and to what degree) about the relevant issues covered in the assessment. The scientific community must bear in mind that users of assessment reports are likely to estimate for themselves the extent of uncertainties if authors do not provide uncertainty estimates. Hence it is desirable for experts to give their best estimates of these uncertainties (e.g., Morganand Henrion 1990). An \"uncertain estimate\" can mean different things to different experts, ranging from an estimate just short of complete certainty to an informedguess or speculation. Sometimes uncertainty results from a lack of infor- mation; on other occasions it is caused by disagreement about what is known or even knowable. Some categories of uncertainty are amenable toquantification, while other kinds cannot be sensibly expressed in terms of probabilities. (See Schneider et al. 1998 for a survey of the literature on characterizations of uncertainty.) Uncertainty is not unique to the domains of biophysical and socioeco- nomic research. Uncertainties also arise from such factors as linguistic imprecision, statistical variation, measurement error, variability, approxi-mation, subjective judgment, and disagreement. These problems can be compounded, however, by additional characteristics of environmental change research, such as potentially long time lags between driving forcesand response at larger scales. Moreover, because environmental change and other complex, sociotechnical policy issues are not just scientific top- ics but also matters of public debate, it is important to recognize that evengood data and thoughtful analysis may be insufficient to dispel some as- pects of uncertainty associated with the different standards of evidence and degrees of risk aversion or acceptance that individuals may hold (Mor-gan 1998; Casman et al. 1999). In many cases, a \"Bayesian\" or \"subjective\" characterization of prob- ability will be appropriate (Gelman et al. 1995; Bernardo and Smith 2000).The Bayesian paradigm is a formal and rigorous method for calculating probabilities, and is often used in the \"rational\" analysis of decisions MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:16 AM 175176 Human Well-being: A for Assessment (Lindley 1985; Pratt et al. 1995). Bayesian statistics can be used to calcu- late probability distributions in the absence of information by using prior distributions that represent best estimates by the scientists making the calculations. This is a different type of subjectivity, which must be ad-dressed in a straightforward and transparent way in the MA calculations. Although \"science\" itself strives for objective empirical information to test theory and models, \"science for policy\" must be recognized as a differ-ent enterprise, involving being responsive to policy-makers' needs for expert judgment at a particular time, given the information currently available, even if those judgments involve a considerable degree of subjec-tivity. Such subjectivity should be both consistently expressed (linked to quantitative distributions when possible), and explicitly stated so that well- established and highly subjective judgments are less likely to get confoundedin policy debates. The key point is that authors should explicitly state what sort of approach they are using in a particular case. Transparency is the key in all cases. Vague or broad statements of \"medium confidence\" that are difficult to support or refute should be avoided. For example, scientists could have at least medium confidence that \"desalinization could alter biodiversity.\" Sucha statement is not particularly informative unless the degree of desaliniza- tion and the direction and severity of the biodiversity change are speci- fied. The point is to avoid conclusions that are essentially indifferent state-ments based on speculative knowledge. The procedure for carrying out an uncertainty analysis depends very much on the data and information available about a particular subject.Where the amount of information is relatively rich, the following proce- dure can be followed: \u0084For each major finding, identify the most important factors and uncer- tainties that are likely to affect the conclusions. \u0084Document ranges and distributions from the literature, including sourcesof information on the key causes of uncertainty and the types of evi- dence available to support a finding. \u0084Make an initial determination of the appropriate level of precision\u2014 determine whether quantitative estimates are possible, or only qualita-tive statements. \u0084Specify the distribution of values that a parameter, variable, or out-come may take in either quantitative or qualitative form. Identify endpoints of the range and provide an assessment of the central tendencyand general shape of the distribution, if appropriate. MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:16 AM 176Analytical Approaches 177 \u0084Rate and describe the state of scientific information on which the con- clusions or estimates in the preceding step are based. \u0084Prepare a \"traceable account\" of how the estimates were constructed,describing reasons for adopting a particular probability distribution. Note that some of these steps (particularly those having to do with estimating the probability distributions of parameters and variables) some- times must be omitted because of lack of information or time to carry out a full analysis. Not only is the method for assessing uncertainty important, so is the communication of uncertainty. Among the effective ways to communi- cate uncertainty is to present it in clear graphical form. Various approachesfor graphical presentation of uncertainties are available, involving trade- offs between simplicity and sophistication, particularly in the choice of the number of dimensions to use in presenting the information. Usingvarious approaches, the degree to which experts agree on the uncertainty estimates can also be depicted. Conclusion The aim of this chapter has been to provide a road-map for how the MAwill be carried out. We have pointed out that such a complex and compre- hensive assessment will raise many difficult issues about data handling,data analysis, uses of modeling, scenario analysis, and so on. Although some of these issues will only be resolved in the course of implementing the MA, this chapter suggests many useful actions for resolving these is-sues. Taken together, these actions make up a coherent analytical approach for achieving the goals of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. MA_CF-148-177.pmd 7/9/2003, 6:16 AM 1778Strategic Interventions, Response Options, and Decision-making EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \u0084Decision-making processes and institutions operate across spatial scales and organizational levels\u2014from the village to the planet. Decision processes arevalue-based and combine political and technical elements to varying degrees.Desirable properties of decision-making processes include equity, attentionto vulnerability, transparency, accountability, and participation. \u0084Strategies and interventions that will help meet societies' goals for the con-servation and sustainable use of ecosystems include incorporating the valueof ecosystems in decisions, channeling diffuse ecosystem benefits to decision-makers with focused local interests, creating markets and property rights, edu-cating and dispersing knowledge, and investing to improve ecosystems andthe services they provide. \u0084The choice among options will be greatly influenced by the temporal andphysical scale of the problem or opportunity, the uncertainties, the culturalcontext, and questions of equity. \u0084Mechanisms for accomplishing these interventions include conventions, laws,regulations, and enforcement; contracts, partnerships, and collaboration; andprivate and public action. \u0084Institutions at different levels have different response options available to them,and special care is required to ensure policy coherence. Decision-making pro-cesses combine problem identification and analysis, policy option identifica-tion, policy choice, policy implementation, and monitoring and evaluation inan iterative fashion. \u0084A range of tools is available to choose among response options\u2014from cul-tural prescriptive rules to cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis. In theselection of an analytical tool and in the evaluation of response options, thesocial, economic, environmental, and historical context should be taken intoaccount. \u0084Policies at each level and scale need to be adaptive and flexible in order tolearn from past experience, to hedge against risk, and to consider uncertainty.However, trade-offs between the responsiveness and the stability of the policyenvironment need to be considered. 178 MA_CF-178-200.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:40 PM 178Strategic Interventions, Response Options, and Decision-making 179 \u0084Intermediate indicators may be required to link policies and actions and their impacts on ecosystems and human well-being. Quantitative indicators makethe trade-offs in policy-making explicit, but qualitative information is valuablewhere measurement is not possible. Traditional and practitioner knowledgeare important sources in addition to science. \u0084\"Boundary organizations\" that synthesize and translate scientific research andexplore the policy implications can bridge the gap between science and deci-sion-making. Journalists have a similar bridging responsibility to ensure thatscience and policy information is transmitted to the public in ways that areboth objective and engaging. Introduction The context of decision-making about ecosystems is changing rapidly. World population continues to grow and become more urban, consump- tion is increasing, the climate is changing, and human actions increas-ingly influence major biogeochemical cycles and the majority of ecosys- tems. In addition, the ecosystems people depend on for services are more tightly coupled to each other and to human systems and in many cases aremore stressed. At the same time, however, scientists and others are devel- oping a far better understanding of how ecosystems function, how they generate ecosystem services, how those services may contribute to humanwelfare, and how values can be assigned to the services. Thus the new challenge to decision-making is to make effective use of new information and tools in this changing context in order to improvethe decisions that intend to enhance human well-being and provide for a sustainable flow of ecosystem services. It seems clear that the choices of the past may not be the most appropriate strategy for the future, and thateven the way people think about intervening in ecosystems must be re- vised to take account of new information, new tools, and new contexts. In addition, some old challenges must still be addressed. Perhaps the most important traditional challenge is the complex trade- off faced when making decisions about how to alter ecosystems with the goal of enhancing the flow of services. Increasing the flow of one servicefrom a system, such as provision of timber, may decrease the flow from others, such as carbon sequestration or the provision of habitat. In addi- tion, benefits, costs, and risk are not allocated equally to everyone, so anyintervention will change the distribution of human well-being\u2014another trade-off. These trade-offs are related to a second ongoing problem: some ben- efits of ecosystem services are easily captured by those who have access to MA_CF-178-200.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:40 PM 179180 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment the system, while others are harder to capture locally. For example, it may be relatively easy for local people to capture the direct use value of timber in a forest via market prices\u2014they are capturing the value of provisioning services. At the same time, people around the world may benefit fromcarbon sequestration by the forest\u2014an indirect use value of a supporting service. Under many institutional arrangements, the people near the for- est have no way to capture this other value. Further, some cultural servicesof ecosystems and the existence value of biodiversity are global and thus difficult for local people to capture. Because the direct use value\u2014 revenues from logging\u2014can easily be converted into income for localpeople, for local and national governments, and for local, regional, and multinational firms, there is a strong incentive to log the forest. In con- trast, the indirect use and existence value\u2014carbon sequestration andappreciation of old-growth forests\u2014are much harder to translate into in- come for anyone. As a result, there will be a tendency for decisions to favor the direct use even though a full analysis of the total value of ecosys-tem services might favor preserving or enhancing the indirect use and existence values by not logging. The characteristics of the ecosystem, the technologies available for using it and monitoring such use, and the institutional arrangements that distribute values across groups all have consequences for what decisions are made (Ostrom et al. 1999; Dietz et al. 2002b). A great deal is under-stood about these problems, and the state of the science often provides guidance on the design of institutions to promote capturing the full value of an ecosystem (Costanza and Folke 1996; Stern et al. 2002). Decision-making Processes The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) must look carefully at de-cision-making processes for choosing among alternative intervention strat-egies. Process influences the intervention chosen. It can also influence those who bring about or respond to an intervention and who facilitate or retard the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Of course, decision-making processes vary across jurisdictions, institutions, and cultures. But broadly accepted norms regarding decision-making and analyses of how decision processes handle information and influence implementation(Hemmati 2001; Petkova et al. 2002; Dietz 2003) suggest some regarding: \u0084use of the best information, MA_CF-178-200.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:40 PM 180Strategic Interventions, Response Options, and Decision-making 181 \u0084transparency and participation, \u0084equity and vulnerability, \u0084cognitive and organizational strengths and weaknesses, \u0084lessons from past decisions and the protection of options, \u0084accountability, \u0084efficiency, and \u0084cumulative and cross-scale effects. The MA is motivated by recent improvements in information about ecosystems, the services they provide, the impact of those services on hu- man well-being, the value of those services, and the design of institutions,programs, and policies to shape behavior. In addition, new tools to use that understanding are being developed. Current decision-making practices of- ten do not reflect these important developments. For example, relativelyfew decisions take account of indirect use value and very few take explicit account of existence values. As a result, many decisions about interven- tion into ecosystems are not based on the best possible information. Notethat information about both facts and values is required and that informa- tion used to make decisions about ecosystems will always be uncertain and involve risk. Thus knowledge about uncertainty and risk is itself an impor-tant component of the decision-making process, as discussed later in the chapter. Processes that are transparent and that involve all those who will be affected by the decision are more likely to be seen as legitimate and to find support when implemented (U.S. National Research Council 1999; U.S. EPA Science Advisory Board 2000). Further, the management of ecosys-tems requires locally grounded knowledge (often referred to as \"traditional ecological knowledge\") and must address questions that can emerge only from an understanding of local situations (Stern and Fineberg 1996; Dietzand Stern 1998; Berkes 2002). That knowledge can be obtained only by interaction with those who have local experience. Finally, since non-use values are an important contribution of many ecosystems to human wel-fare, people who are not local to an ecosystem but who benefit from its non-use values must also be engaged. This implies that decision-making processes should involve stakeholders effectively, a principle that has be-come central to risk analysis. Although no universal prescriptions on how best to do this are pos- sible, a growing literature on public participation in environmental 1994; Renn et al. 1995; Slocum et al. 1995; Stern 1999; Beierle and Cayford 2002). Sometimes formal negotiation and conflict resolution pro- cesses are helpful, but in almost all cases careful design of participationmechanisms is important to good decision-making. In terms of equity and vulnerability, changing the provision of ecosys- tem services very often produces \"winners\" and \"losers.\" For effective imple-mentation, the benefits, costs, and risks across groups must be balanced in an equitable way (Agrawal 2002; McCay 2002). Given that many changes in ecosystems can have important impacts on the poor, special attentionto the most vulnerable populations is also warranted, as is special atten- tion to human health. Individuals, groups, communities, and organizations have varying strengths and weaknesses in processing information (Kahneman et al. 1982; but see Cosmides and Tooby 1996; Wilson 2002). Decision processes will be most effective if they make use of the kinds of decision tools describedin this chapter to compensate for limits and weaknesses. The understanding of ecosystem dynamics will always be limited, so- cioeconomic systems will continue to change, and outside determinantscan never be fully anticipated. As Campbell (1969) noted over three de- cades ago, all policies are experiments. Decisions should consider whether or not a course of action is reversible and should incorporate, wheneverpossible, procedures to evaluate the outcomes of actions and learn from them. That is, people should try to learn from these experiments and use that knowledge in designing new ones. Debate about how exactly to dothis continues in discussions of adaptive management, social learning, safe minimum standards, and the precautionary principle (Gunderson et al. 1995b; Yohe and Toth 2000). But the core message of all approaches is thesame: acknowledge the limits of human understanding, give special con- sideration to irreversible changes, and evaluate the impacts of decisions as they unfold. In terms of accountability, the consequences of decisions do not always redound directly to those who make them. As noted earlier, those who might decide to harvest timber from a forest may not bear any of the con-sequences of disrupting the flow of supporting and cultural services and so will not take such services into consideration in making their decision. This problem is exacerbated in the face of uncertainty and risk\u2014the rela-tionship between a decision and its consequences is hard to see. Effective decision-making can develop only if the people making decisions are ac- countable for the results (Perrow 1984). Unfortunately, in many circum- MA_CF-178-200.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:40 PM 182Strategic Interventions, Response Options, and Decision-making 183 stances the lack of accountability removes the incentive for decision-makers to use the best information available. In a world of scarce resources\u2014fiscal, human, and natural\u2014efficiency should be an important criterion for choosing among intervention op-tions. This is a central tenet of environmental and resource economics, and there are numerous effective tools for examining the efficiency of vari- ous options, as described later. In reality, the goals of equity, encouraginglearning, and protecting options need to be considered together with the goal of maximizing efficiency. This typically leads to a multicriteria deci- sion problem. Many decisions about interventions into ecosystems are made at a lo- cal level. As noted earlier, this involves balancing locally concentrated costs and benefits against those that are more widely distributed and harderto capture. Another way to think about this is that decisions based only on a local analysis can miss cumulative effects of the same kind of decision being taken in multiple localities. Thus, too narrow a scope of analysisresults in decisions that are less than optimal from a larger perspective (Olson 1965). Appropriate decisions emerge only when all relevant scales are considered. Although these eight features of decision processes seem consequen- tial and deserve serious attention, it is unclear exactly how they influence decisions and implementation and especially how the impact varies acrosscontexts. Analysis of how the characteristics of the decision process influ- ence changes in ecosystem services and human well-being deserves care- ful attention in the MA. Response Options and Strategic Interventions There are many options for responding to the need to protect and restoreecosystems and the services they provide and to ensure the equitable dis-tribution of the benefits of those services. Fundamentally, these options can be characterized as interventions that stimulate or suppress certain human activities and those that create knowledge or investment. Theycan take the form of prescriptions of behavior (that is, \"command and control\" or assignment of accountabilities), incentives and disincentives (that is, creating or assigning property rights or establishing markets, sub-sidies, and taxes), education and knowledge sharing, or direct investment and expenditure (Kaufmann-Hayoz et al. 2001; Dietz and Stern 2002). The range of response options and strategic interventions that should be applied to a particular problem will depend on such factors as its na- MA_CF-178-200.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:40 PM 183184 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment ture (economic, environmental, or social), its scale (temporal, spatial, or institutional), and the capacity of the actor or decision-maker to make change. The MA will evaluate the use and effectiveness of various response options and strategic interventions within this context. For example, as knowledge and understanding of the value of ecosystem services increases, the merits of investments to improve or restore ecosystems may becomeapparent. But in order to attract the financial, human, and social capi- tal\u2014whether public or private\u2014needed to pursue such opportunities, in- centives may be required that include the assignment of \"property rights\"in ecosystem services. In addition, mainstream economics suggests that a set of property rights that is comprehensive, exclusive, enforceable, and transferable is neces-sary for efficient outcomes. Yet many of the problems in the economics of the environment can be understood in terms of the failure of systems of property rights to meet this ideal. The failures range from theoverexploitation of open access resources to the creation of nuisance or enjoyment to others without compensation (called externalities in the language of economics). Efficient economic outcomes also require perfectinformation, so that all participants have the same complete information, including about the consequences of their actions. Less-than-perfect in- formation about the functioning of ecosystems can be a significant ob-stacle to effective choices. Although there is a tendency to think of property rights in terms of private property, many institutional arrangements in fact create propertyrights that are not fully private. The sort of village-level institutions that many societies have developed to allocate the rate and intensity of use of common property such as pastureland is an example of this. It is the break-down or failure of these institutions to evolve that can lead to exploita- tion of the commons. There is growing understanding of the functioning of common prop- erty resource regimes (Ostrom et al. 2002). Points to consider about the community using the resource include its size and cultural homogeneity, the options for mobility in and out of the community, the frequency ofcommunication between individuals, the density of social networks, prac- tices of reciprocity, and the degree of adherence to shared norms. The characteristics of the resource itself must also be looked at, such as itsmobility, its capacity to be stored, and the clarity of its boundaries. These considerations influence the ease and cost of monitoring resource users' behavior and the state of the resource. The continuing state of the com- MA_CF-178-200.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:40 PM 184Strategic Interventions, Response Options, and Decision-making 185 mon property is the result of all these factors and the ease and cost of enforcing rules about its use. Gaining access to economic rents from resources in the absence of ef- fective allocation of property rights can be a powerful motivator for manyindividuals and groups. In many cases, central governments\u2014as the own- ers of natural resources on behalf of a nation\u2014attempt to monopolize these rents. This may make perfect sense for highly concentrated resources likeminerals or crude oil, but for dispersed resources such as forests, control by the central government may stop communities from using local resources. Not surprisingly, people with no property right in local forest resources seelittle benefit in managing these resources in a sustainable manner. The pursuit of resource rents helps to explain much of the political economy of the use of ecosystems. Because returns on investment are highwhen external costs are disregarded, the powerful and those with access to capital have strong incentives to seek these rents. The exercise of political power by individuals, families, and groups in pursuit of resource rents leadsto many of the inequities observed in access to and use of natural resources. In addition, where the powerful have the means to exploit natural re- sources but no legitimate property right, many of the problems ofsustainability, of overriding cultural and intrinsic values, and even of effi- ciency (in terms of broader social welfare) can be explained. Response options and strategic interventions that align property rights in ways thatconsider all stakeholders or that internalize all costs will be a focus of the MA. Response options and strategic interventions can be implemented through a number of mechanisms, including international conventions; multilateral and bilateral treaties; national and local laws, regulations, and enforcement; institutional change and changes in governance structures;governmental and industrial policies; contractual agreements, partnerships, and collaboration; and private and public action. International agreements concerned with ecosystems range from gen- eral principles, such as those contained in global framework conventions, to detailed regulatory arrangements with compliance provisions. When negotiated and approved by sovereign states, in principle these agreementsconstitute the boundary conditions for all related prevailing social, eco- nomic, and political national policies. In many cases, however, these con- ditions will depend on enactment and enforcement of laws and regula-tions that are designed to implement a nation's responsibilities under the agreement. A literature is emerging on the implementation and effective- ness of such treaties and conventions (Victor et al. 1998). MA_CF-178-200.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:40 PM 185186 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment National-level decision-making has a special role in several respects. First, even the best-designed local or regional actions are likely to be inef- fective in the absence of proper coordination (for example, a stringent and enforced protective measure in one region may simply shift a harmfulactivity to another region). Second, key legislative power often is anchored at the national level (although the distribution between the national and sub-national levels varies among nations). Finally, nations are the recog-nized parties in the increasing number of international negotiations and agreements. Nevertheless, they face domestic constraints with respect to policy-making because of the ability of sub-national entities\u2014regional orsectoral, and government or nongovernmental\u2014to influence processes and outcomes. Government policies to protect ecosystems can fail if they are at odds with the prevailing social reality: poverty-stricken communitieshave little to lose by ignoring laws on protected areas if no alternative source of living is provided and if enforcement is weak. There also are many policies emerging among networks of private- sector firms that may have substantial impact on ecosystems and their services (Dietz and Stern 2002). These include a variety of agreements that set standards and codes of practice for the extraction of resources andthe production of goods. Such policies are sometimes applied within a single nation, but there are an increasing number of international agree- ments as well. They are voluntary but are often coordinated with govern-ments, international agencies, and environmental nongovernmental organizations. Just as with national and international policies, the private-sector agreements may be undermined by local economic circum-stances, by a lack of technical capacity at the local level, or by conflicting performance standards within and between private firms. One important type of strategic intervention that requires assessment is incorporation of the value of ecosystem services into decision-making. Decisions and actions that have direct or indirect effects on ecosystems are usually taken with human well-being in mind, but it is not certain thathuman well-being (taken broadly) has been enhanced if ecosystem effects have not been taken into consideration. For example, it is useful to think of two kinds of human actions that affect ecosystems and their services:local action that changes ecosystem services directly, and the actions of a number of individuals across a locale, region, or the planet, which produce effects that can be cumulative, dispersed, indirect, but in fact systematic.Humans change biological and chemical cycles, disperse both synthetic and natural chemicals in new ways, and alter planetary processes such as climate and the incidence of ultraviolet radiation. These cumulative or MA_CF-178-200.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:40 PM 186Strategic Interventions, Response Options, and Decision-making 187 indirect effects are often unintentional, but they can have substantial im- pacts on ecosystems throughout the globe. The bulk of the ecosystem degradation literature is concerned with direct interventions, but it is increasingly important to consider how indi-rect actions influence ecosystems, how these changes interact with direct changes, and how to develop policies and management strategies to deal with each. Conversely, many decisions that influence ecosystems made atthe local level are shaped by regional, national, and global conditions (Vayda 1988; Dietz and Rosa 2002). When an ax swings to cut a tree in a forest, there is a sense in which the decision to clear land is made locally.But that decision is influenced by physical infrastructure (such as roads and mills) and by institutions (markets, enforcement of property rights, and land protection regimes) that are in turn shaped by regional, national,and global circumstances. So while decision-making is local, the local ac- tion can be shaped by global forces and have global implications. The extent to which a full range of costs and benefits, including eco- system services and effects, both direct and indirect, are incorporated in decision-making processes\u2014that is, are felt by the decision-maker\u2014 determines the quality of those processes. Therefore, the efficacy and needfor strategic interventions that aggregate and focus these costs and ben- efits on the \"local decision-maker\" should be assessed. In this regard, as the full costs of action have been concentrated in this way, markets willpass them to ultimate consumers to help them become informed about ecosystem effects and influenced in their consumption behavior. Markets for carbon emissions and sequestration credits are an interesting exampleof capturing costs and benefits that are otherwise external and making them available to local decision-makers. Usable Knowledge A simplified picture of the role of knowledge in decision-making is shownin Figure 8.1, which portrays three interacting processes: monitoring, the decision-making cycle, and the flow of information to and from stake-holders. Policy-making starts by identifying a problem, then it defines policy options and their choice, formulation, and implementation, and ideally it finishes with monitoring and evaluation of the results of executed actions.The process is interactive and iterative and takes place within a specific institutional structure. At all stages, decisions are based on the values, preferences, intuitions, prejudices, and social situations of the organiza-tions and individuals who make them. The process engages all \"stakehold- MA_CF-178-200.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:40 PM 187188 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment ers,\" including effective delivery of essential information to decision- makers, communication among stakeholders, and multidirectional exchanges among information providers and information users. Measurement assembles information from regular monitoring (the outer cycle in Figure 8.1) and other sources. The identification, analysis, and advocacy of issues all require comprehensive and detailed knowledge ofhuman (socioeconomic) and environmental conditions and major trends, including the nature, distribution, and impact of direct and indirect driv- ers. Hence they need to draw on accounts, spatial assessments, a compre-hensive indicator-based assessment, and sometimes also a science assess- ment. (See Box 8.1.) The same tools are required for the analysis of options and the choice of actions or policies. They provide the detailed knowledge necessary to examine which issues to address and in what ways, taking account of fea- sibility, cost-effectiveness, and the likely impacts of different options onsocioeconomic and environmental conditions as well as on particular stake- holders. Policies are implemented through institutions. An institutional analy- sis is necessary to identify the constraints on implementation and what needs to be done to overcome them. Because implementation depends heavily on the active support and participation of stakeholders, they needFIGURE 8.1 Information in the Decision-making Cycle See text for explanation. MA_CF-178-200.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:40 PM 188Strategic Interventions, Response Options, and Decision-making 189 BOX 8.1 Accounts and Assessments Accounts are assemblages of numerical data, converted to a common unit (money, weight, area, or energy). They can produce valuable composite indicators (con- structed directly from data), such as the gross domestic product, genuine saving, and the ecological footprint. Spatial assessments are assemblages of spatial data. They use geographic informa- tion systems to show the location, size, pattern, condition, and ecological, eco- nomic, or cultural values and characteristics of land and water areas. They providebasic information for the allocation of uses and are a means of compiling useful composite indicators, such as the status of ecosystem diversity, the extent and secu- rity of ecosystem protection, and the extent and severity of land degradation. Indicator-based assessments are assemblages of indicator variables. Because they rely on representative indicators, they can be selective, and thus they can cover the wide array of issues necessary for an adequate portrayal of human well-being, envi-ronmental conditions, and human-environment interactions. Indicators of success are derived: \u0084in the biophysical/ecological sciences from different kinds of environmental data, \u0084in sociology and anthropology from concepts of social stability or resilienceamong individuals or higher organizational units, \u0084in political sciences from the efficiency with which policies are implemented, \u0084in jurisprudence from the extent of compliance with law, and \u0084in economics from the impacts of policy on social welfare. Because of the confusing and often conflicting signals sent by a large number of individual indicators, assessment methods that produce indexes (compound indica-tors or combinations of lower-level indicators) are much easier to interpret and can provide decision-makers with clearer and more compelling information. Examples are the Human Development Index prepared annually by the United Nations De-velopment Programme and the Wellbeing Index put together by the International Development Research Centre of Canada and others. Science assessments use a mixture of numerical data, spatial data, and indicator variables to formulate a scientific consensus on major issues. Whereas other evalu- ations are conducted regularly, science assessments tend to be produced occasion- ally, as the need arises. A recent example is the reports of the IntergovernmentalPanel on Climate Change. Similarly, European Environment Agency reports col- lect, analyze, and report data on the state and direction of environmental quality in the entire European region. Models and integrated assessments conducted for theConvention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution give feedback to nego- tiators on policy options. They can have many different impacts on the policy pro- cess: change the terms of a debate (by introducing new policy options, for example),prompt new participants to be concerned about an issue, or change the interests, behavior, or strategies of current participants. MA_CF-178-200.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:40 PM 189190 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment to be informed and feedback should be obtained from them at every stage in the decision-making cycle. Monitoring and indicator-based assessments track implementation, re- cording: \u0084whether actions or policies were implemented, \u0084whether they achieved their intended results, and \u0084whether new factors have arisen, in which case the entire cycle is re- peated. Failure to implement requires examining whether the policy was cor- rect, the necessary constituency developed, the instruments put in place,and\u2014if all that happened\u2014the instruments were appropriate. If the rel- evant indicators used by the indicator-based assessment are unlikely to change in time, one or more intermediate or proximate indicators will beneeded to establish a causal link between the actions or policies and the intended results in terms of their impacts on ecosystems and human well- being. This may be complex, as changes in the state of ecosystems andprovisioning of services can be caused by several factors operating simul- taneously, such as parallel policies, or by external factors such as changes in economic activities. Also, ecosystems are dynamic by nature, and hu-man-induced changes cannot always be distinguished from natural ones. Time lags between responses and ecosystem improvement or change can be considerable, and therefore it is important to evaluate impacts on di-rect and indirect drivers as well. Analytical frameworks, such as that developed by the European En- vironmental Agency (EEA), can be built upon in a MA-type assessmentof response options (EEA 2001). The EEA framework distinguishes be- tween the various components of policy development, implementation of measures, strategies, interventions, and ultimate impacts on ecosys-tems and society. It also indicates some of the key issues or questions that need to be addressed. The design and structure of objectives affect the resource requirements (financial and human), which in turn willaffect the efficiency of policy outputs. In this framework, the needs of society, the impacts on the environment, and the outcomes of policies are external to the policy development process. The evaluation of differ-ent responses is always in terms of relevance of objectives and the ulti- mate welfare of society as a result of implementation of these responses. (Issues related to evaluating the policy-making process are discussed inthe first section of this chapter.) MA_CF-178-200.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:40 PM 190Strategic Interventions, Response Options, and Decision-making 191 To be usable, knowledge needs to address the particular concerns of a user. In the context of the MA, information should have a clear connec- tion to direct and indirect drivers, ecosystem services, and human well- being. General characteristics of good indicators are described in Chapter7; other characteristics of indicators useful for policy-making are that they: \u0084relate directly to policy options, goals, or targets (such as the Millen- nium Development Goals); \u0084capture change over early warning; or \u0084characterize the optimal, sufficient, or insufficient level of a given eco- system service. It is important to keep in mind that usable knowledge deals with differ- ent spatial scales, time frames, and organizational levels. The principal findings are seldom easily transferable from one scale or level to another.Indeed, in most cases the transfer of information across scales needs a special effort. One example is an evaluation of the regional or local im- pact of global climate change or other global phenomena. The recentlystressed notion of a \"place-based\" science for sustainability\u2014which should be relevant for local policy-making\u2014points in this direction (ICSU 2002a). It is equally important\u2014and difficult\u2014to translate long-term impacts thatmay affect only future generations into terms relevant to day-to-day deci- sion-making. The MA will produce a wealth of policy-relevant, preferably quantita- tive data. This does not mean that everything must be quantified. Indeed, as noted earlier, some elements of sustainable development are intrinsi- cally hard to quantify, and not everything can be turned into numericaldata or graphical expressions. This is also true of information and knowl- edge on some social and economic assets. It is impossible to express in a credible way and in quantitative terms the intrinsic value of biodiversityor the nature of social relationships. But to avoid neglecting them, it is necessary to provide qualitative ways of gathering and communicating information, such as ethnographies of collective actors, assessment of cul-tural dimensions, case studies, qualitative studies of corruption, and quali- tative surveys. But the majority of \"usable knowledge\" is in the form of numerical or other quantitative information (ICSU 2002b). Among various forms of such information, indicators play an important role. Indicators provide MA_CF-178-200.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:40 PM 191192 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment the basis for assessing progress toward sustainable development. Long-term targets only have meaning as policy goals if progress toward them can be assessed objectively. This requires targets expressed in precise terms. Care- ful measurement will also improve the ability to identify interactions be-tween different policies and deal with possible trade-offs. These are al- ready a part of policy-making, but the advantage of measurement is that trade-offs are made explicit and transparent. The MA aims to incorporate both formal scientific information and traditional or local knowledge. Traditional societies have nurtured and refined systems of knowledge of direct value to those societies but also ofconsiderable value to assessments undertaken at regional and global scales. This information often is unknown to science, and can be an expression of other relationships between society and nature in general and of sustain-able ways of managing natural resources in particular (ICSU 2002c). To be credible and useful to decision-makers, all sources of information, whether scientific or traditional, must be critically assessed and validatedas part of the assessment process through procedures relevant to the form of knowledge. The findings of an assessment are likely to be used if they are accept- able to potential users or if the users at least regard the sources and process to be legitimate. A legitimate source is one judged to be so by the knowl- edge system concerned, whether a scientific discipline, a government, or atradition. (Science has a way of establishing the legitimacy of its knowl- edge, and traditional societies have ways of establishing the legitimacy of the knowledge within a particular culture. But methods that apply acrosscultures or to science and traditional knowledge together do not yet ex- ist.) A legitimate assessment process is one that satisfies users that it is fair and that their interests have been taken into account. So-called globalassessments may be questioned by less powerful countries, for instance, because they feel their input was not included or that their interests were ignored; this corresponds to a lack of legitimacy (EEA 2001). This appliesalso to information of other kinds at national or local levels. In some cases, wide gaps may exist between the sources of usable knowl- edge and the potential users. Organizations that synthesize and translatescientific research and explore its policy implications are able to bridge this gap. They are sometimes called \"boundary organizations\" because they facilitate the transfer of usable knowledge between science and policy andthey give both policy-makers and scientists the opportunity to cross the boundary between their domains. Journalists have a similar bridging re- sponsibility to ensure that science and policy information is transmitted MA_CF-178-200.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:40 PM 192Strategic Interventions, Response Options, and Decision-making 193 to the public in ways that are both objective and engaging. Capacity build- ing is desirable in both these areas. Dealing with Risk and Uncertainty Risk refers to the probability that certain actions or decisions will result inharm to humans or have adverse effects on their well-being. Since risk is inherent in all human activity and is usually associated with efforts to secure greater benefits for human well-being, it cannot be eliminated fromhuman progress, technology development, or social innovation. But the assessment of risk, including ecological risk assessment, now has an ad- vanced set of tools for comparing apparently dissimilar environmentalthreats, options for balancing risks and benefits and the potential trade- offs, and means for ensuring equitable management policies or actions aimed at enhancing the situations of the poor and other vulnerable groups(Jaeger et al. 2001; Dietz et al. 2002a). Risk assessment has significant potential for informing the decision process, particularly when decisions are highly complex and uncertain. The assessment process has several functions. The first is analysis, to provide the knowledge base needed to support sound decisions. This should draw, as noted throughout this report, on both scientific and traditional orlay sources of knowledge to identify and characterize the benefits and risks that various human actions or decisions will have for ecosystem services and human well-being. It should also identify alternative decision optionsaimed at enlarging benefits, minimizing or eliminating risks, or securing greater fairness in the distribution of benefits and risks. Such analysis should include specific appraisal of the types and magnitudes of uncertainty asso-ciated with the estimates. A second function of assessment is that of deliberation, which is an important attribute of the process (Stern and Fineberg 1996; Dietz andStern 1998). Deliberation refers to the consultative process and stake- holder involvement, which helps ensure completeness and inclusiveness in the values that different people attach to potential benefits and risks. Many decisions involved in the management of ecosystems involve high levels of uncertainty or even ignorance. This has led to increased interest in a certain strategy of decision process, which can be described asadaptive management. This approach begins with the recognition that the decision situation or the management challenge is only partly knowl- edge, and that high levels of uncertainty or ignorance will continue tocharacterize the situation. In such cases, there are many advantages to MA_CF-178-200.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:40 PM 193194 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment structuring the decision process as on ongoing set of interventions that are essentially experiments, as described earlier, and then learning about the relationships based on the outcomes of the decision. This assumes that surprises and unexpected events occur and that management needsto be highly responsive and flexible rather than attempting to control and eliminate variability and uncertainty. The principles of adaptive management and the relevant experience in the Columbia River Basinhave been examined by Lee (1993) and elaborated by others (Gunderson et al. 1995b). Concern that the large uncertainties accompanying the threats to eco- systems and related human well-being will lead to long delays in decision- making and management response has led to increased use of the precau- tionary principle. As defined in Principle 15 of the 1992 Rio Declaration,this means that \"[w]here there are threats of serious or irreversible dam- age, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for post- poning cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation\"(United Nations 1992:3). A variety of versions of this principle are now in use, with differing implications for assessment and decision-making. Though some commentators have viewed the precautionary principle asan alternative to risk analysis, it is in effect an ethical principle for par- ticular decision situations that is largely compatible with risk analysis. Risk assessment provides valuable knowledge for when to invoke the precau-tionary principle and the form it might take, but this should not preclude the continuing development of risk-related knowledge to be used in future decisions. Risk assessment and risk management techniques are often used in the broader processes of environmental impact assessment and strategic envi- ronmental assessment. The former is the process of evaluating possibleenvironmental impacts of a proposed project, covering all possible harm- ful and favorable socioeconomic, cultural, and health-related impacts. Most countries have legislation requiring an environmental impact statementbefore a project or development is authorized, but the enforcement, prac- tice, and quality requirements for the process vary widely across countries and even across regions within a country. Strategic environmental assess-ments identify and evaluate the possible environmental implications of proposed policies, broader programs, or large-scale plans in a comprehen- sive and systematic manner. Their scope ranges from overall sectoralpolicies (such as a national water policy) to comprehensive regional de- velopment strategies. They often provide the context and the background information for project-specific environmental impact assessments. MA_CF-178-200.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:40 PM 194Strategic Interventions, Response Options, and Decision-making 195 At a more comprehensive level, communities, nations, groups of na- tions, or international organizations regularly produce State of the Envi- ronment reports to assess environmental trends and conditions and the performance of existing environmental regulations as well as to help for-mulate new or revised environmental targets and policies. Such reports often identify newly emerging issues or dangerous trends that would be investigated in a strategic environmental assessment in more detail. Ac-cordingly, the three types of activities are closely related and represent key features of the decision-making processes dealing with the interactions between people and ecosystems. Decision Analytical Frameworks and Tools The diverse characteristics of the decision-making situations associatedwith ecosystem and biodiversity management imply the need for a rangeof decision analytical frameworks (DAFs) and tools. A decision analytical framework is defined as a coherent set of concepts and procedures aimed at synthesizing available information from relevant segments of an ecosys-tem management problem in order to help policy-makers assess conse- quences of various decision options. DAFs organize the relevant informa- tion in a suitable framework, apply a decision criterion (based on someparadigms or theories), and identify the best options under the assump- tions characterizing the analytical framework and the application at hand. It is important to note that none of the frameworks can incorporate thefull complexity of decision-making; hence their results supply only part of the information shaping the outcome. And there are always hidden value judgments involved in the selection and application of DAFs. A broad range of frameworks can be used in principle and has been used in practice to provide information for policy-makers concerned with ecosystem-related decisions at various levels. Based on Toth (2000), Table8.1 provides an exemplary rather than an all-encompassing list. (See the MA Methods report for concise descriptions of these frameworks.) Many DAFs overlap in practice. Further, one method of analysis often requiresinput from other methods. As a result, a clear classification of methods and their application to real-world problems is sometimes difficult. DAFs can be divided into several types: normative DAFs, such as deci- sion analysis and cost-benefit analysis, that deal more directly with valua- tion and commensuration; descriptive DAFs that consider outcomes that may result from certain actions, such as game theory; and deliberativeDAFs that deal with the discovery of information from people and by MA_CF-178-200.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:40 PM 195196 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment people, such as simulation-gaming. A number of DAFs, such as behavioral decision theory or portfolio theory, have elements that may be described as either normative or descriptive. Finally, there are the DAFs in traditionaland transitional societies that can be typified as ethical and cultural. Several factors determine what type of DAF can be applied and what sort of framework can provide useful information for decision-making. Thecontext of the decision incorporates social, economic, and environmental dimensions. Most of the decisions affecting ecosystems are private ones made by individuals (as owners, operators, or users) or by firms focusing onTABLE 8.1 Decision Analytical Frameworks Decision Principles Treatment of Uncertainty Framework Optimization/ Efficiency Precautionary Principle Equity Rigor Form Level of Application Domain of Application Decision analysis * + + * St X B Cost-benefit analysis * - + + * SA Sc X D Cost-effectiveness analysis * + + + * SA Sc X D Portfolio theory * + - * St X D Game theory + - + + * SA St X I Public finance theory * - * - SA N-R D Behavioral decision theory - + + - Sc N-M B Policy exercises + + + + Sc X B Focus groups - + + - Sc R-M B Simulation-gaming - + + + Sc X B Ethical and cultural prescriptive rules - + + - Sc N-M D Compatibility with/usability of decision principles in DAFs: - weak but not impossible + possible but not central * essential feature of DAF Level of application: G = Global I=Inter/Supra-national N=National R = Regional/Sectoral (Sub-national) L=Local (community) M = Micro (Family, firm, farm) X = All Typical domain of application: D=Direct intervention I=Indirect influence B=Both Uncertainty Interventions, Response Options, and Decision-making 197 efficiency and attempting to maximize expected returns. Such decisions are heavily influenced by the prevailing social norms and aspirations, how- ever, and by existing rules and institutions. An important part of the context in which private decisions take place is the existing set of rules and regulations put in place by public policies. Modern (as opposed to traditional) societies have established procedures to assess the environmental, social, and economic implications of differ-ent public decision options. They also tend to have legally prescribed or routinely adopted decision analytical frameworks to choose among the options according to widely accepted criteria for public policy. But theseprocedures are usually restricted to decisions of an immediate nature (such as building concessions or emission rights). Impacts from diffuse sources and cumulative impacts such as excessive land depletion are generally dealtwith less efficiently. In contrast, many societies in transition economies and in developing countries do not have such established procedures; eco- system decisions therefore appear to be more arbitrary. In many countries,both industrial and developing, short-sighted or outright flawed public policies often lead to private actions with disastrous consequences for eco- systems. Complex management situations and severe ecosystem disrup-tions arise from the clashes of traditional and modern societies and during the transition from the former to the latter. The criteria considered important in any decision situation form dif- ferent decision-making principles. The predominant criteria for a so- cially desirable or at least widely accepted decision outcome are rooted deeply in the historical traditions of managing the given ecosystem, inthe prevailing social conditions (ranging from the values local actors attach to ecosystem services to the existence and enforceability of prop- erty rights and government regulations), and in the economic condi-tions (level of development, distribution of income, and access to resources and social services). These factors need to be considered care- fully when determining the decision-making principles to guide the choiceof a decision analytical framework. These principles can be used indi- vidually or in combinations as DAFs are adopted to address specific ecosystem problems. Table 8.1 indicates some general decision-makingprinciples and their compatibility with relevant DAFs. It is clear that some DAFs can accommodate some decision principles better than others, but full incompatibility is rare. Key characteristics of ecosystem decision problems are the spatial and temporal scales involved. They determine the jurisdictional level at which the frameworks appear to be most helpful. Table 8.1 also contains en- MA_CF-178-200.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:40 PM 197198 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment tries regarding the decision-making level at which the given DAF can be applied. There are many ways to affect individual and social behavior deter- mining ecosystem management. Some decision analytical frameworks aremore suitable in support of decisions to regulate management directly; others are more helpful in sorting out decisions that will affect broader behavioral choices. Accordingly, another series of entries in Table 8.1 in-dicates whether the DAF at hand is applicable to decisions concerned with ecosystem management directly or for broader policies that influ- ence primary or proximate drivers. Additional key features of the ecosystem decision problem are related to the level of complexity and uncertainty involved and the availability of data. Two columns in Table 8.1 provide indications of the ability of the framework to address uncertainties. The first series indicates the level of rigor (high, good, or moderate/low) at which the given framework can treat uncertainties. The second class of entries shows the typical formadopted for uncertainty analysis in the framework (inherent in the model structure, as in classic decision analysis; parametric or Monte Carlo-based sensitivity analysis; or scenarios). There is no formal assessment or \"decision analysis\" in traditional soci- eties. In some circumstances, environmental, demographic, economic, and technological forces lead to unsustainable practices in traditionalsocieties (e.g., Krech III 1999). But many indigenous peoples have been managing their ecosystems in a sustainable manner for centuries or even millennia (Ostrom et al. 2002). The information basis of their manage-ment practices was grounded in long-standing experience, conscious observation, and inadvertent \"experiments\" triggered by natural events or human incidence. The guidelines distilled from these very long-term ob-servations were incorporated into religious rules, cultural rituals, and other social-behavioral principles. From time to time, collisions between tradi- tional societies and ecosystems led to ecosystem degradation (mostly tem-porary, sometimes permanent) or to social disruptions that were resolved by changing management practices, technologies, or social arrangements. Rapid socioeconomic changes overwhelming the institutional capaci- ties of ecosystem management have caused the largest shifts in ecosystem structure, function, diversity, and productivity. This situation character- ized the period when modern societies first encountered previously un-known regions. The inadvertent introduction of alien species, ranging from microscopic pathogens (against which local people and ecosystems were not immune) to mammals (for example, rodents abundant on ships), and MA_CF-178-200.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:40 PM 198Strategic Interventions, Response Options, and Decision-making 199 the deliberate introduction of new value systems (precious metals), man- agement practices (cut and run), and technologies (chain saw) disrupted traditionally established balances between society and ecosystems. Simi- lar processes can still be observed in the \"transition\" societies of manydeveloping countries: the old values and rule systems concerning ecosys- tem management have broken down but no new rules or enforcement capacities have been put in place. These societies and social situationsclearly require assessment and decision analytical capacities in order to establish the new ecosystem management rules and organize their enforce- ment, but there is hardly any sign of such efforts due to the lack of re-sources and, often, interest. Only recently has the need to integrate indigenous ecological knowl- edge into ecosystem assessments and into developing resource manage-ment plans been recognized (e.g., Agrawal 1995; Appiah-Opoku and Mulamoottil 1997; Hellier et al. 1999). Often this recognition comes late. Actual efforts undertaken are characterized by varying degrees of integrityand intensity. The increasing assimilation of indigenous peoples, even in remote rural regions, into the modern socioeconomic system has greatly eroded traditional ecological knowledge\u2014in many regions, irreversibly. Ifindigenous institutions of ecosystem management (social, political, and judicial institutions and religious beliefs, norms, and practices) have also largely disappeared, it does not make much sense to attempt to reincar-nate them. A more sensible strategy is likely to be to firmly establish mod- ern institutions and regulatory mechanisms in order to prevent further degradation and possibly to promote restoration of ecosystem quality andservices. Given the lack of modern monitoring equipment and scientific data about ecosystems, traditional ecological knowledge may well make valuable contributions to the development of modern management strat-egies in these areas. In contrast, in regions where indigenous institutions and knowledge are still reasonably intact and play a significant role in using ecosystemservices, it is worth considering how to incorporate them into the modern institutional and regulatory framework. Taboos rooted in religion, har- vesting rules overseen by the community, and penalties imposed by theindigenous judicial system are likely to be more effective ways to protect and use ecosystems sustainably than reliance on disrespected, ill-enforced, or corruption-plagued government regulation. Yet in the dynamics of the real world, as social change and economic transformation are proceeding inexorably, the co-management of ecosys- tems by traditional rules and modern regulation faces new challenges from MA_CF-178-200.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:40 PM 199200 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment time to time. Downs (2000) argues that cultural acceptability of any alter- native practice is key, especially at the local scale of the village or indig- enous population, so including them in the decision-making is important to achieve sustainability. The selection of DAFs to help craft socially just,acceptable, environmentally effective, and economically efficient policies becomes a particularly delicate task. It is all the more complex because indigenous perceptions and management of ecosystems are far from ho-mogenous. Atran et al. (2002) observe that three groups who live in the same rain forest in Guatemala show profoundly different behaviors, cog- nition, and social relations in relation to the forest. In some regions where indigenous communities have persisted on the periphery of modern societies (in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Mexico), there has been increasing concern in recent years aboutintegrating traditional values and knowledge in modern assessment and decision analytical frameworks (Goma et al. 2001; Paci et al. 2002). The ultimate objective is to step beyond assessment and, by acknowledgingthe rights and incorporating the environmental knowledge of indigenous communities, to make progress towards co-management of ecosystems (Faust and Smardon 2001). In summary, the choice of the decision analytical framework to support the formulation of policies and measures regarding ecosystem manage- ment is influenced by a large number of factors. They range from the so-cial, economic, and cultural context to the geographical and related juris- dictional scale, and from the complexity and uncertainty characteristics of the problem to the preferred nature of the intervention. Advanced ana-lytical frameworks (such as multicriteria decision analysis or cost-benefit analysis) have been widely and successfully used to select among policy options in public and private sectors in many industrial countries. In con-trast, some regions with severe environmental problems and high risks of ecosystem degradation are ones in which traditional ecological knowl- edge and management schemes have faded away but new assessment pro-cesses and management systems are still weak or hardly established. In many countries, increasing attempts to combine modern analytical tech- niques with traditional ecological knowledge, where it still exists, indicatea promising future direction.

Baseline: A set of reference data sets or analyses used for comparative purposes; it can be based on a reference year or a reference set of (standard) conditions. Bayesian probability: A subjective characterization of probabilities of outcomes arising from a certain decision. Benefits transfer: Economic valuation approach in which estimates obtained (by whatever method) in one context are used to estimate values in a different context. This approach is widely used because of its ease and low cost, but is risky because values are context-specific and cannot usually be transferred. Bias: Systematic error in a data set due to approaches and methods and their application in sampling, investigation, measurement, classification, or analysis. Biodiversity: The variability among living organisms from all sources including terrestrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part;this includes diversity within and among species and diversity within and among ecosys- tems. Biomass: The mass of living tissues in either an individual or cumulatively across organisms in a population or ecosystem. Boundary organizations: Public or private institutions that synthesize and translate scientific research and explore its policy implications to help bridge the gap between science and decision-making. Capability: The combinations of doings and beings from which people can choose to lead the kind of life they value. Basic capability is the capability to meet a basic need. Capacity building: A process of strengthening or developing human resources, institutions, or organizations. Capital value (of an ecosystem): The present value of the stream of future benefits that a ecosystem will generate under a particular management regime. Present values are typicallyobtained by discounting future benefits and costs; the appropriate rates of discount are often a contested issue, particularly in the context of natural resources. Change in productivity approach: Economic valuation techniques that value the impact of changes in ecosystems by tracing their impact on the productivity of economic production processes. For example, the impact of deforestation could be valued (in part) by tracing theimpact of the resulting changes in hydrological flows on downstream water uses such as hydroelectricity production, irrigated agriculture, and potable water supply. Characteristic scale: The typical extent or duration over which a process is most significantly or apparently expressed. 208 MA_CF-201-250.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:36 PM 208Glossary 209 Command and control: The policy framework in which environmental (e.g., emission stan- dards for each source and each pollutant) and resource (catch or logging limits for each site or species) management rules are prescribed by the regulator, leaving little flexibility foractors in the implementation. Common pool resource: A valued natural or human-made resource or facility in which one person's use subtracts from another's use and where it is often necessary but difficult to exclude potential users from the resource. See also common property resource . Common property resource: A good or service shared by a well-defined community. See also common pool resource . Constituents of well-being: The experiential aspects of well-being, such as health, happiness, and freedom to be and do, and, more broadly, basic liberties. Conservation value: See existence value . Consumptive use: The reduction in the quantity or quality of a good available for other users due to consumption. Contingent valuation (CV): Economic valuation technique based on the stated preference of respondents regarding how much they would be willing to pay for specified benefits. A detailed description of the good or service involved is provided, along with details about how it will be provided. CV is designed to circumvent the absence of markets by presentingconsumers with hypothetical markets in which they have the opportunity to buy the good or service in question. The methodology is controversial, but widely accepted guidelines for its application have been developed. Core data set: Data sets designated as having wide potential application throughout the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment process. These data sets will be made available to all workinggroups and scientists within the program, and their common use will maximize consistency among analyses. Examples include land use, land cover, and population data sets. Cultural landscape: See landscape . Cultural services: The nonmaterial benefits people obtain from ecosystems through spiritual enrichment, cognitive development, reflection, recreation and aesthetic experience, in- cluding, for example, knowledge systems, social relations, and aesthetic values. Decision analytical framework (DAF): A coherent set of concepts and procedures aimed at synthesizing available information from relevant segments of the given ecosystem manage- ment problem in order to help policy-makers assess consequences of various decisionoptions. DAFs organize the relevant information in a suitable framework, apply decision criteria (both based on some paradigms or theories), and thus identify options that are better than others under the assumptions characterizing the analytical framework and theapplication at hand. Decision-maker: A person whose decisions and actions can influence a condition, process, or issue under consideration. Decomposition: The ecological process carried out primarily by microbes that leads to a trans- formation of dead organic matter into inorganic mater; the converse of biological produc- tion. For example, the transformation of dead plant material, such as leaf litter and dead wood, into carbon dioxide, nitrogen gas, and ammonium and nitrates. Determinants of well-being: Inputs into the production of well-being, such as food, clothing, potable water, and access to knowledge and information. MA_CF-201-250.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:36 PM 209210 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment Direct use value: In the total economic value framework, the benefits derived from the goods and services provided by an ecosystem that are used directly by an economic agent. These include consumptive uses (e.g., harvesting goods) and nonconsumptive uses (e.g., enjoy-ment of scenic beauty). Agents are often physically present in an ecosystem to receive direct use value. Compare indirect use value . Domain (of scale): The combined range of characteristic scales for a given process in both space and time. Downscaling: The process of converting data or information at a course resolution to a finer resolution. Driver: Any natural or human-induced factor that directly or indirectly causes a change in an ecosystem. Driver, direct: A driver that unequivocally influences ecosystem processes and can therefore be identified and measured to differing degrees of accuracy. Driver, endogenous: A driver whose magnitude can be influenced by the decision-maker. The endogenous or exogenous characteristic of a driver depends on the organizational scale. Some drivers (e.g., prices) are exogenous to a decision-maker at one level (a farmer) butendogenous at other levels (the nation-state). Driver, exogenous: A driver that cannot be altered by the decision-maker. See also endogenous driver . Driver, indirect: A driver that operates by altering the level or rate of change of one or more direct drivers. Ecological footprint: The area of productive land and aquatic ecosystems required to produce the resources used and to assimilate the wastes produced by a defined population at a speci- fied material standard of living, wherever on Earth that land may be located. Ecological security: A condition of ecological safety that ensures access to a sustainable flow of provisioning, regulating, and cultural services needed by local communities to meet their basic capabilities. Ecosystem: A dynamic complex of plant, animal, and microorganism communities and their nonliving environment interacting as a functional unit. Ecosystem approach: A strategy for the integrated management of land, water, and living resources that promotes conservation and sustainable use in an equitable way. An ecosys-tem approach is based on the application of appropriate scientific methodologies focused on levels of biological organization, which encompass the essential structure, processes, functions, and interactions among organisms and their environment. It recognizes thathumans, with their cultural diversity, are an integral component of many ecosystems. Ecosystem assessment: A social process through which the findings of science concerning the causes of ecosystem change, their consequences for human well-being, and management and policy options are brought to bear on the needs of decision-makers. Ecosystem boundary: The spatial delimitation of an ecosystem, typically based on discontinuities in the distribution of organisms, the biophysical environment (soil types, drainage basins, depth in a water body), and spatial interactions (home ranges, migration patterns, fluxes ofmatter). Ecosystem function: An intrinsic ecosystem characteristic related to the set of conditions and processes whereby an ecosystem maintains its integrity (such as primary productivity, food chain, biogeochemical cycles). Ecosystem functions include such processes as decomposi- tion, production, nutrient cycling, and fluxes of nutrients MA_CF-201-250.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:36 PM 210Glossary 211 Ecosystem health: A measure of the stability and sustainability of ecosystem functioning or ecosystem services that depends on an ecosystem being active and maintaining its organiza- tion, autonomy, and resilience over time. Ecosystem health contributes to human well-being through sustainable ecosystem services and conditions for human health. Ecosystem interactions: Exchanges of materials and energy among ecosystems. Ecosystem properties: The size, biodiversity, stability, degree of organization, internal exchanges of materials and energy among different pools, and other properties that characterize anecosystem. Ecosystem services: The benefits people obtain from ecosystems. These include provisioning services such as food and water; regulating services such as flood and disease control; cul- tural services such as spiritual, recreational, and cultural benefits; and supporting services such as nutrient cycling that maintain the conditions for life on Earth. The concept \"eco-system goods and services\" is synonymous with ecosystem services. Ecosystem stability: A description of the dynamic properties of an ecosystem. An ecosystem is considered stable if it returns to its original state shortly after a perturbation (resilience), exhibits low temporal variability (constancy), or does not change dramatically in the face of a perturbation (resistance). Emergent property: A phenomenon that is not evident in the constituent parts of a system but that appears when they interact in the system as a whole. Equity: Fairness of rights, distribution, and access. Depending on context, this can refer to resources, services, or power. Existence value: The value that individuals place on knowing that a resource exists, even if they never use that resource (also sometimes known as conservation value or passive usevalue). Extent: The length or area over which observations were made or for which an assessment was made or over which a process is expressed. Externality: A consequence of an action that affects someone other than the agent undertak- ing that action and for which the agent is neither compensated nor penalized. Externalities can be positive or negative. Forecast: See prediction . Freedom: The range of options a person has in deciding the kind of life to lead. Freedom is similar to the concept of capability and can be used interchangeably. Functional redundancy: A characteristic of species within an ecosystem in which certain spe- cies contribute in equivalent ways to an ecosystem function such that one species may substitute for another. Note that species that are redundant for one ecosystem function may not be redundant for others. Geographic information system (GIS): A computerized system organizing data sets through a geographical referencing of all data included in its collections. A GIS allows the spatialdisplay and analysis of information. Global scale: The geographical realm encompassing all of Earth. Good social relations: Social cohesion, mutual respect, good gender and family relations, and the ability to help others and provide for children. Grain (of a phenomenon): A spatial unit that can be considered internally homogenous. Grain (of observation) is the fundamental (that is, the smallest) unit of observation. MA_CF-201-250.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:36 PM 211212 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment Habitat: Area occupied by and supporting living organisms. Also used to mean the environ- mental attributes required by a particular species or its ecological niche. Health: Strength, feeling well, and having a good functional capacity. Health, in popular idiom, also connotes an absence of disease. The health of a whole community or population is reflected in measurements of disease incidence and prevalence, age-specific death rates,and life expectancy. Hedonic price methods: Economic valuation methods that use statistical techniques to break down the price paid for goods and services into the implicit prices for each of their at- tributes, including environmental attributes such as access to recreation or clean air. Thus the price of a home may be broken down to see how much the buyers were willing to pay fora home in a neighborhood with cleaner air. Herbivory: The consumption of plants by animals. Hierarchical systems: Systems that can be analyzed into successive sets of nested subsystems. Indicator: Information based on measured data used to represent a particular attribute, charac- teristic, or property of a system. Indirect use value: The benefits derived from the goods and services provided by an ecosystem that are used indirectly by an economic agent. For example, an agent at some distance from an ecosystem may derive benefits from drinking water that has been purified as it passedthrough the ecosystem. Compare direct use value . Institutions: The rules that guide how people within societies live, work, and interact with each other. Formal institutions are written or codified rules. Examples of formal institutions would be the constitution, the judiciary laws, the organized market, and property rights. Informal institutions are rules governed by social and behavioral norms of the society, fam-ily, or community. Instrumental: A means to an end. Interventions: See responses . Intrinsic value: The value of someone or something in and for itself, irrespective of its utility for someone else. Irreversibility: The quality of being impossible or difficult to return to, or to restore to, a former condition. See also option value , precautionary principle , resilience , and threshold . Kantianism: A theory of ethics that ascribes intrinsic value to rational beings and is the philo- sophical foundations of contemporary human rights and the extended ascription of intrinsic value to a wide spectrum of nonhuman natural entities, including ecosystems. Land cover: The physical coverage of land, usually expressed in terms of vegetation cover or lack of it. Influenced by but not synonymous with land use . Land use: The human utilization of a piece of land for a certain purpose (such as irrigated agriculture or recreation). Influenced by but not synonymous with land cover . Landscape: An area of land that contains a mosaic of ecosystems, including human-dominated ecosystems. The term cultural landscape is often used when referring to landscapes contain-ing significant human populations. Length of growing period: For the purposes of the system definitions used in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, this is defined for terrestrial ecosystems as the total number of days in a year during which rainfall exceeds one half of potential evapotranspiration. Level: The discrete levels of social organization, such as individuals, households, communities, and nations. See also scale. MA_CF-201-250.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:36 PM 212Glossary 213 Market failure: The inability of a market to bring about the allocation of resources that best satisfies the wants of society. In particular, the overallocation or underallocation of re- sources to the production of a particular good or service caused by spillovers or informa-tional problems or because markets do not provide desired public goods. Megadiversity country: One of 17 countries (Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philip- pines, Papua New Guinea, South Africa, United States, and Venezuela) home to the largest fraction of known species in the world. Metadata: The collection of information related to the type and characteristics of data sets and their location in a data archive. Open access resource: A good or service over which no property rights are recognized. Opportunity cost: The benefits forgone by undertaking one activity instead of another. Option value: The value of preserving the option to use services in the future either by oneself (option value) or by others or heirs (bequest value). Quasi-option value represents the value of avoiding irreversible decisions until new information reveals whether certain eco- system services have values society is not currently aware of. Parasitism: The consumption of one individual by another in which the consumer resides on (ectoparasite) or within (endoparasite) the body of its host or victim. Passive use value: See existence value . Pastoral system: The use of domestic animals as a primary means for obtaining resources from habitats. Policy failure: A situation in which government policies create inefficiencies in the use of goods and services. Policy-maker: A person with power to influence or determine policies and practices at an international, national, regional, or local level. Pollination: The completion of the sexual phase of reproduction in some plants by the transpor- tation of pollen. In the context of ecosystem services, pollination generally refers to animal- assisted pollination, such as that done by bees, rather than wind pollination. Precautionary principle: The management concept stating that in cases \"where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reasonfor postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation,\" as defined in the Rio Declaration. Precision: The ability of a measurement to be consistently reproduced. Also, the degree of accuracy. Predation: The consumption of animals by other animals. Prediction (or forecast): The result of an attempt to produce a most likely description or estimate of the actual evolution of a variable or system in the future. See also projection and scenario . Primary production: Assimilation (gross) or accumulation (net) of energy and nutrients by green plants and by organisms that use inorganic compounds as food. Private costs and benefits: Costs and benefits directly felt by individual economic agents or groups as seen from their perspective. (Externalities imposed on others are ignored.) Costs and benefits are valued at the prices actually paid or received by the group, even if theseprices are highly distorted. Sometimes termed \"financial\" costs and benefits. Compare social costs and benefits . MA_CF-201-250.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:36 PM 213214 Ecosystems and Human Well-being: A Framework for Assessment Probability distribution: A distribution that shows all the values that a random variable can take and the likelihood that each will occur. Projection: A potential future evolution of a quantity or set of quantities, often computed with the aid of a model. Projections are distinguished from \"predictions\" in order to emphasize that projections involve assumptions concerning, for example, future socioeconomic andtechnological developments that may or may not be realized; they are therefore subject to substantial uncertainty. Property rights: An institution that gives someone possession rights to use things and to pre- vent others from using them; includes private, collective, common, public, and state prop- erty rights. Provisioning services: The products obtained from ecosystems, including, for example, ge- netic resources, food and fiber, and fresh water. Rangeland: An area where the main land use is related to the support of grazing or browsing mammals, such as cattle, sheep, goats, camels, or antelope. Regulating services: The benefits obtained from the regulation of ecosystem processes, includ- ing, for example, the regulation of climate, water, and some human diseases. Reporting unit: The spatial or temporal unit at which assessment or analysis findings are re- ported. In an assessment, these units are chosen to maximize policy relevance or relevanceto the public and thus may differ from those upon which the analyses were conducted (e.g., analyses conducted on mapped ecosystems can be reported on administrative units). Resilience: The capacity of a system to tolerate impacts of drivers without irreversible change in its outputs or structure. Resolution (of observation): The spatial or temporal separation between observations. Responses: Human actions, including policies, strategies, and interventions, to address spe- cific issues, needs, opportunities, or problems. In the context of ecosystem management, responses may be of legal, technical, institutional, economic, and behavioral nature and may operate at local or micro, regional, national, or international level and at various timescales. Risk: The probability or probability distribution of an event or the product of the magnitude of an event and the probability of its occurrence. Safe minimum standard: A decision analytical framework in which the benefits of ecosystem services are assumed to be incalculable and should be preserved unless the costs of doing so rise to an intolerable level, thus shifting the burden of proof to those who would convert them. Scale: The physical dimensions, in either space or time, of phenomena or observations.. See also level. Scenario: A plausible and often simplified description of how the future may develop, based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about key driving forces (e.g., rateof technology change, prices) and relationships. Scenarios are neither predictions nor pro- jections and sometimes may be based on a \"narrative storyline.\" Scenarios may be derived from projections but are often based on additional information from other sources. Security: Access to resources, safety, and the ability to live in a predictable and controllable environment. MA_CF-201-250.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:36 PM 214Glossary 215 Social costs and benefits: Costs and benefits as seen from the perspective of society as a whole. These differ from private costs and benefits in being more inclusive (all costs and benefits borne by some member of society are taken into account) and in being valued at socialopportunity cost rather than market prices, where these differ. Sometimes termed \"eco- nomic\" costs and benefits. Compare private costs and benefits . Spatial resolution: See resolution . Stakeholder: An actor having a stake or interest in a physical resource, ecosystem service, institution, or social system, or someone who is or may be affected by a public policy. Statistical variation: Variability in data due to error in measurement, error in sampling, or variation in the measured quantity itself. Strategies: See responses . Supporting services: Ecosystem services that are necessary for the production of all other eco- system services. Some examples include biomass production, production of atmosphericoxygen, soil formation and retention, nutrient cycling, water cycling, and provisioning of habitat. Sustainability: A characteristic or state whereby the needs of the present and local population can be met without compromising the ability of future generations or populations in other locations to meet their needs. Taxa: Nested groups of species that reflect similarity. Familiar taxa are birds (which belong to the class Aves ) and fig trees (which belong to the genus Ficus ). Taxonomy: A system of nested categories ( taxa) reflecting evolutionary relationships or mor- phological similarity. Threshold: A point or level at which new properties emerge in an ecological, economic, or other system, invalidating predictions based on mathematical relationships that apply atlower levels. For example, species diversity of a landscape may decline steadily with in- creasing habitat degradation to a certain point, then fall sharply after a critical threshold of degradation is reached. Human behavior, especially at group levels, sometimes exhibitsthreshold effects. Thresholds at which irreversible changes occur are especially of concern to decision-makers. Time series data: A set of data that expresses a particular variable measured over time. Total economic value framework: A widely used framework to disaggregate the components of utilitarian value, including direct and indirect use value , option value , quasi-option value and existence value . Travel cost methods: Economic valuation techniques that use observed costs to travel to a destination to derive demand functions for that destination. Developed to value the recre- ational use of protected areas, they have limited applicability outside this context. Uncertainty: An expression of the degree to which a future condition (e.g., of an ecosystem) is unknown. Uncertainty can result from lack of information or from disagreement aboutwhat is known or even knowable. It may have many types of sources, from quantifiable errors in the data to ambiguously defined terminology or uncertain projections of human behavior. Upscaling: The process of aggregating or extrapolating information collected at a fine resolu- tion to a courser resolution or greater extent. Utilitarian: An approach that focuses on the satisfaction of human preferences. In some cases, this is taken further and made the basis of a moral viewpoint. See also utilitarianism . MA_CF-201-250.pmd 7/8/2003, 10:36 PM A Framework for Assessment Utilitarianism: A creed that accepts utility or the greatest happiness as the foundation of morals and holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness. Utility: In economics, the measure of the degree of satisfaction or happiness of a person. Value: The contribution of an action or object to user-specified goals, objectives, or condi- tions. Value systems: Norms and precepts that guide human judgment and action. Valuation: The process of expressing a value for a particular good or service in a certain con- text (e.g., of decision-making) usually in terms of something that can be counted, oftenmoney, but also through methods and measures from other disciplines (sociology, ecology, and so on). Well-being: A context- and situation-dependent state, comprising basic material for a good life, freedom and choice, health, good social relations, and security.

Leading scientists from more thannations are conducting the assessment through working groups chaired by members of the Millennium Assessment Panel, with oversight by a Board com-prised of representatives of international conventions, United Nations agencies,scientic organizations,and leaders from the pri-vate sector, civil society, and indigenous groups.The MA was launched byUN Secretary-GeneralKoAnnan in June . The full assessment re-ports will be released in .
