I gently & lovingly access their energy & bring forth unfinished business & messages for my client. We may even start a dialogue and new relationship with from the other side. This relieves the anxiety of not knowing what really happened around the death & what it means for the future. Like Stacy Peacock mentioned you can go by their site or a book. Finding a flower essence practitioner is also helpful. Sometimes diagnosing ourselves can be difficult. With hypnotherapy, you are able to have communication between your consciousness and your subconsciousness, with the help of your superconscious, or higher self. Usually, your consciousness is only awake when you are physically awake, and your subconsciousness is only awake when you are physically asleep. But during hypnosis, they both are and can effectively work together in order to deeply heal and reprogram traumas from this lifetime and before, as well as old habits that you want to change as well, such as smoking, over-eating and other deeply set habits. When working with my Age Regression Hypnosis clients, I am able to help them completely change the way events unfolded for them in their past, not by changing the way they remember them, but by removing the trauma from them! They are able to bring their wise adult self into those times and find deep and true release. And then they are able to find full forgiveness for others, along with themselves, and set themselves up for a bright and brilliant future that they even get to map out through the process! I have reports of clients feeling more release and healing from 3 sessions than from 6 years of talk therapy. Hypnotherapy is a valuable tool that works when a person relaxes enough to access deeply held negative beliefs blocking your life & health. Fears can get in the way of this process, so addressing fears around this issue & having trust in your practitioner is vital. Reiki is a subset of energy work, involving the channeling of Reiki, or Universal Energy. Being Reiki-attuned means you have taken steps to channel this specific energy in healing. Reiki is intelligent and only does what is good for the person. Intuitive healing uses the intuition to direct energy, also with the intention of promoting the highest good of the client. This is a more broad term. Often, the tools used are ones that the individual practitioner has developed in order to deal with certain issues. For example, I would use my energetic toolbox and intentions to remove an energetic weapon and dispose of it, and also channel Reiki to heal and fill the area with good energy and seal the aura. No two practitioners are the same, although many use similar tools. An intuitive session consists of an intuitive tapping into Source energy and/or your energy field to receive messages. Now, every intuitive travels to different densities and dimensions based on their frequency. The way an intuitive poses a question is an absolute game changer when it comes to reading energy. There is not one place intuitives go to in the astral world. The nature of your energetic field will affect the way I frame a question and travel to other densities. Meaning the more one is open, receptive and in a state of love, the more one will receive because the responses of questions have to meet your energetic rhythm too, hence why every reader and client has their own unique session. My goal is to help you understand your past and present to make more empowered decisions in your future. I meet you where you are at and help you get on your highest and most fulfilling timeline! Inner child healing involves working with the subconscious patterns that were imprinted in our brain as a child. Our subconscious mind operates off learned memory patterns and controls most of our behavior. Prior to age 7 we lack the ability to reason which means our perceptions are directly downloaded into our subconscious minds without context. This is an influential time in our lives as it programs our minds and drives our actions and behavior throughout our lives. Inner child healing involves developing an awareness of the deeply imprinted feelings and beliefs within us. When we bring these deeply embedded belief systems into our conscious, reasoning mind we can reprogram our brain. Our inner child wants nothing more than to be seen and heard. When we carry wounds from our childhood those pieces within us cry out for attention, holding us back in our lives and creating symptoms within our bodies. A key part of our healing journey involves making these parts feel seen and heard so we can feel whole again and back in charge of our lives. Nutrition can address the root cause by investigating what's triggering the dermatitis in the first place. Other body parts contribute - weak adrenals prevent healing, weak detox mechanisms prevent the trigger from being properly removed and weak skin is simply more prone to dermatitis. Food, supplements and lifestyle therapies can be used to stop the trigger and strengthen the adrenal, detox and skin systems to prevent and heal dermatitis. Great question. Thank you for sharing. What if you changed the focus point and instead ask, how do I make me happy? The shift is subtle. Did you catch it? What can you do for yourself and in your life to make you happy. Rather than searching for happiness on the outside, get in touch with yourself from within and fulfill yourself. Wonderful, and very common, question! There are many ways to support IBS and the best way will look different for everyone based on their personal situation. I feel that a often over-looked, yet highly impactful, factor is HOW you are eating. Are you scarfing your food down? Eating in a distracted way? Not paying attention to hunger and satiety cues. These are harder to tackle than a simple diet switch but when practiced regularly, they can lay a beautiful foundation to find long-term relief. Some simple strategies to begin to incorporate: -pause for a few deep/slow breaths before eating -put away the distractions (phone, TV, reading material...) -put your fork down between bites and savor the flavors -pay attention to the flavors, textures -take note of how your stomach feels as it begins to fill with food. These are just for starters. Choose 1 or 2 that land for you and begin to practice. It takes time but again, it is a necessary foundation to build in order to find long term success. There are many pathways -- the first I'd say to you is Awareness. Often times it has to do with misplaced energy that needs to be aligned and or recalibrated. As a Practitioner that works with clients on their inner equilibrium, breath patterns, and the like using the GYROKINESIS\u00ae Expansion System (which organically brings that back into \"reset\") -- we observe standing, posture, and walking patterns to help them with those inner-operatives and balance. Try it Today! From my perspective, I believe that spiritual hypnotherapy mostly has to do with soul work and aligning the client with their own soul/higher self and gaining resolutions in their lives leading them to becoming complete and whole. This is something I specialize in and find it extremely liberating for everyone involved. Harmonyum is a powerful, elegant, spiritual healing system that was developed with the aim of making self-healing possible. It addresses disease at the mental and emotional level so that it may no longer exist in the physical body. Harmonyum leads to glowing health, vigor, happiness and increased longevity through the slowing of the aging process. HOW HARMONYUM CAN HELP YOU Harmonyum promotes excellent health in the body and spirit by nurturing and strengthening one's primal essence. It promotes profound states of deep relaxation and restores the body to an ideal state of balance and harmony. Continuous treatments release the body's innate healing wisdom and bestow the effects of years of meditation, bringing you into a higher cycle of manifestation. SCIENCE Harmonyum is a gentle hands-on healing system directed at the spine, brain and internal organs. Now available as Harmonyum at a distance via zoom, skype, facetime Harmonyum employs the ancient art of utilizing the acupuncture meridians via the body's electromagnetic field. According to Chinese meridian theory, meridians are the communication structure for energy in the same way that veins and arteries are the communication for blood throughout the body and nerve tracks are the communication for neural messages. The energy that travels through meridians influences all other body fluids such as blood and hormones and all other systems such as the nervous system, immune system and cardiovascular system. The Harmonyum Healing System floods the meridians with the highest vibrations causing a cascade of revitalization to the body and advancement of the mind. HARMONYUM IN CLINICAL SETTINGS Religious and Spiritual Neutrality Harmonyum is a safe and appropriate therapeutic modality for hospitals and medical offices serving patients and clients of all philosophical and spiritual backgrounds. It integrates easily with health plans that include psychology, psychiatry, internal medicine, acupuncture, chiropractics and physical therapy as an allied healing modality. Empowering the Self Healing Mechanism and not Diagnosing The primary goal of a Harmonyum Healing Treatment is to empower the self healing mechanism inside each person. The philosophy behind the Harmonyum experience is that it is a time when the practitioner and client release the connection to the health disturbance and focus on complete balance. For this reason, during certification programs, practitioners are guided to maintain spiritual neutrality toward all clients. Additionally, they are instructed not to discuss emotional, spiritual or psychological issues and not to diagnose their clients. While the Harmonyum treatment was developed through a certain spiritual tradition, its mechanism for effectiveness requires no need of belonging or participating in those spiritual activities. Theoretical Framework While research on the effectiveness and mechanisms for the effects of Harmonyum are currently under way, the following three areas show the most promise: Acupuncture Meridians, Spinothalamic Tract of the Nervous System and Meditation. Attribution One of the cornerstones of academic integrity is the adherence to attributing credit to the source of information. In medical science this is especially important as the collective knowledge base is built upon the shoulders of previous researchers and thinkers. Documenting the lineage of current wisdom provides the ability to more deeply understand and more thoroughly critique that which is being posited. We urge that this same academic rigor must be applied to the indigenous and spiritual thinkers who have made significant contribution to modern medical practices and discoveries. The first academics were often spiritual thinkers. In many communities, the spiritual leader was also the medical care provider and theorist. The great discoveries that allowed humanity to survive were made within a spiritual paradigm of thought. Many vital techniques that are integral to modern medicine were developed and discovered in direct association with their spiritual belief system. For example, herbal medicine, is the basis of modern pharmacology. In 2003, it was reported that approximately 80% of all antimicrobial, cardiovascular, immunosuppressive, and anticancer drugs are of plant origin (Pan, 2013). In her article documenting the statistical success rate of pharmaceutical development, Si-Yuan Pan states the following, \"Given that the development of synthetic chemicals for therapeutic use is, by and large, a random process that might result in serendipitous discovery, many pharmaceutical companies are now focused on the development of plant-derived drugs (2013).\" Other modern branches of medicine owe tribute to early, spiritually based systems. For example the bone setters of China (Zhigang, 1996), Native American healers, the Curanderas of Mexico and South America and the tuina therapists of China contributed to the field of orthopedics, chiropractics and physical therapy. The field of neuroscience has developed much interest in the role the mind plays in health. There has been a surge in research on benefits of meditation in recent years. In 2013, a successful result was achieved in research on breast cancer survivors and meditation's effect on sleep and fatigue (Lev-ari, 2013). Another positive result was obtained on anxiety and systolic blood pressure in nursing students (Chen, Y, 2013). Meditation is the direct descendent of the spiritual systems throughout the world. To benefit from the discoveries brought forth from the developers of meditation and not give credit to the spiritual systems that developed them over the years would be a direct violation of the scientific standard of attribution. Physicians such as Dr. Lawrence Bohun (1610-11) and Dr. John Tennent (1736) were just a few documented physicians who observed the Native American herbalists (Vogel, 1970). It is the opinion of our organization, based upon legal president, that during the course of a Harmonyum session, it is not an obligation of the practitioner to discuss the origin of the therapy. However, if a direct inquiry is made, it is the obligation of the practitioner to provide this information. The Relationship between Medicine and Spirituality While our organization promotes the right of every patient or client to receive medical care free from religious pressure or promotion, it is also recognized that very little that happens in medicine that was developed independent of spirituality. The difference between performing a spiritual ritual and utilizing a healing system that was derived from spiritual sources is defined in the following way by our organization. A spiritual ritual is an action taken on the part of one or more individuals to delve into a particular form of spirituality for primarily worship and devotional purposes. The act of utilizing a healing system that is derived from a spiritual source implies that the recipient and practitioner are engaged in the prescribed steps that produce a particular physical response intended for physical healing. For example, during an acupuncture treatment, the practitioner may think in a Taoist paradigm for the purposes of diagnosing and deciding upon a needling strategy. This does not mean that the recipient, in any way, becomes Taoist or is prompted to explore Taoism. In a Harmonyum treatment, no spiritual advice is provided, no promotion of engagement in a religious activity or affiliation is involved. The treatment session is said to be spiritually neutral. This makes Harmonyum an appropriate healing modality regardless of the spiritual, philosophical or religious affiliation of the recipient. Energy Medicine Energy medicine has received recent interest as is evidenced by the increase in research dedicated to the topic. It has been conducted for the purposes of understanding its existence, mechanism, determine its effectiveness. Harmonyum falls into the category of energy and touch medicine. There are parts that require soft and superficial touch along the spine and other parts that involve projecting an electromagnetic force from the hands. This skill is little understood and the idea that it is even possible is controversial for scientists and the general public. This capacity is often tied to the existence of energy meridians that are capable of absorbing and emitting electromagnetic fields. Joines, Bawmen and Kruth investigated the existence of electromagnetic emission from humans during focused intent. They found that certain individuals, who called themselves healers or meditators, were able to control the emission of measureable and significant levels of electromagnetism (2012). In 2013, Baldwin, Fullmer and Schwartz conducted research comparing physical therapy with energy healing for improving range of motion in subjects with restricted shoulder mobility. Other researchers such as Juliano in 2011, Moga and Bengston in 2010, Yin Lo in 2012, Baldwin in 2013 and numerous others have conducted research on energy healing and over time it has become increasingly accepted in the medical fields. Acupuncture is a form of energy medicine that works on the energy meridians. It is now considered an essential health benefit in most states of the union and the Affordable Care Act now dictates that all health insurance packages cover acupuncture. According to the American Hospital Association, 15% of American hospitals (more than 800 facilities) offered Reiki as a hospital service in 2007. A joint publication by the American Holistic Nurses Association and American Nurses Association lists Reiki as an accepted form of treatment (Baldwin, 2013). Yes. It restores a sense of trust to your bodily experience without the mind's anticipation, urge to flight/fight and calms/brings you to a state of peace that you'll need through the procedure. Yes, there are ways to manage social anxiety and this can allow your introversion to become an incredible asset. Introversion can be a powerful gift in social settings. I know it may not always feel like it. But it is often an indicator of your sensitivity and perceptiveness. It can help you listen intently and ask intriguing questions. It can help you truly connect at a deep level with others around you. It can help you have incredible insights about situations and offer amazing guidance and advice to others. The trouble can be that our anxiety can get in the way of our ability to fully tap in and access the gifts of our introversion. But there are things you can do for relief. I did a one hour workshop all about how to feel less anxious - this may help you. You can access it for free by going to https://www.beliefseed.com/free.

My email is Lisa@beliefseed.com. Hi Constance, thank you for your question. It's difficult to suggest an approach to treating PTSD without knowing the person who is suffering with it. There are several approaches that are helpful including Hypnosis, EMDR, Somatic Experiencing, EFT, Yoga, & Mindfulness and a skilled practitioner will be able to help find the best one for each individual. All the best to you! Past life regressions can help find answers to problems in this lifetime for sure. In my work I usually focus on the issue or problem, and if past life comes up, then the reason hence the solution for the issue/problem is from there. If scenes from this life come up, then the reason hence the solution for the issue/problem is from this life. Of course there can be overlap. I often have clients wanting a past life regression because of issues or problems, but they are open to going back wherever their subconscious wants to take them, and often they actually go back to scenes in this lifetime. I think it is partly (or entirely) due to the fact that as human beings we are automatically suppressing and dissociating from trauma and stressful situations in our life that are often the reason for issues/problems in life, so when we are at the stage that we realize we need professional help, we don't have any sense or awareness anymore of the issues/problems having their source in this life. Sugar cravings can mean that you're craving sweetness in your life that has nothing to do with actually eating sweets. Maybe you're craving love, which would indicate a heart chakra issue. When you heal that issue and allow yourself to receive/give in a healthy way the love/sweetness you crave, your sugar cravings will go away. Thanks for asking this question. I imagine this is causing a good deal of frustration. Of course, this is not a simple answer as there could be a variety of factors playing a role but I think a good place to start is by addressing your expectations. By doing what you are doing, what are you expecting? What are you hoping for and what factors might indicate that you are moving in the right direction (i.e. increased energy, improved mood and focus, feeling purposeful). And most importantly, what else allows you to feel like that so you don't put all the pressure on these changes. Hope that makes sense! While genetic testing is viable, it is yet to be a preventive standard. Currently, genetic testing is per request by your medical doctor from a specific medical concern. Single gene, panel, and large-scale genetic or genome testing are the primary types. For general information about testing, you can go to the Center For Disease Control & Prevention's page: https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/gtesting/genetic_testing.htm About risks, genetic markers can reveal predispositions of conditions or diseases before the symptoms occur. However, as Dr. Joyce Rockwood noted, plant-based diets can significantly protect you from many diseases, including those that are inherited. Why plant-based foods? For our bodies to function optimally, plant-based foods contain most of the nutrients our bodies require. When our gut is healthy, we are healthier. In addition to our genetic disposition, there are many environmental factors to consider too. For example, the quality of the air, water, and food interact with our genes, producing modifications, noted by Dr. Val Prahl, by way of epigenetics. Suffice to state that you can influence your genetics through routine activities. For example, ask yourself, is there anything you can do each day to promote your health? Ultimately, you are the decider. Of course, there is more to health than the physical. From a 3P view, your health begins in the psyche. Each of us thinks our way through life with a conscious mind. Our experience may vary each moment, yet there is a direct link between spirit and body. In this sense, our genetics, such as its modifications, rely on our well-being. For example, did you know that your immune system is more robust when you are happy and absorb nutrients more efficiently than sad? An attitude of gratitude can make a difference in your life and is a powerful remedy to genetically inherited diseases. "}
