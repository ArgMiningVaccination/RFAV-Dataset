God ] [ had been graciously preparing me during many ] [years for the reception of this final revelation of the ab] [6solute divine Principle of scientific mental healing. ] [ This apodictical Principle points to the revelation of ] [Immanuel, \"God with us,\" \u2014 the sovereign ever-pres] [9Mission of Christian Scienceence, delivering the children of men from ] [every ill \"that flesh is heir to.\" Through ] [Christian Science, religion and medicine are ] [12inspired with a diviner nature and essence; fresh pinions ] [are given to faith and understanding, and thoughts ac] [quaint themselves intelligently with God. ] [15 Feeling so perpetually the false consciousness that life ] [Discontent with lifeinheres in the body, yet remembering that in ] [reality God is our Life, we may well tremble ] [18in the prospect of those days in which we must say, \"I ] [have no pleasure in them.\" ] [108:1 Whence came to me this heavenly conviction, \u2014 a con] [viction antagonistic to the testimony of the physical senses? ] [3According to St. Paul, it was \"the gift of the grace of ] [God given unto me by the effectual working of His power.\" ] [It was the divine law of Life and Love, unfolding to me ] [6the demonstrable fact that matter possesses neither sen] [sation nor life; that human experiences show the falsity ] [of all material things; and that immortal cravings, \"the ] [9price of learning love,\" establish the truism that the ] [only sufferer is mortal mind, for the divine Mind cannot ] [suffer. ] [12 My conclusions were reached by allowing the evidence ] [of this revelation to multiply with mathematical certainty ] [Demonstrable evidenceand the lesser demonstration to prove the ] [15greater, as the product of three multiplied by ] [three, equalling nine, proves conclusively that three times ] [three duodecillions must be nine duodecillions, \u2014 not ] [18a fraction more, not a unit less. ] [ When apparently near the confines of mortal existence, ] [standing already within the shadow of the death-valley, ] [21Light shining in darknessI learned these truths in divine Science: that ] [all real being is in God, the divine Mind, and ] [that Life, Truth, and Love are all-powerful and ever-] [24present; that the opposite of Truth, \u2014 called error, sin, ] [sickness, disease, death, \u2014 is the false testimony of false ] [material sense, of mind in matter; that this false sense ] [27evolves, in belief, a subjective state of mortal mind which ] [this same so-called mind names matter, thereby shutting ] [out the true sense of Spirit. ] [30New lines of thought My discovery, that erring, mortal, misnamed ] [mind produces all the organism and action of ] [the mortal body, set my thoughts to work in new channels, 109 ] [109:1and led up to my demonstration of the proposition that ] [Mind is All and matter is naught as the leading factor in ] [3Mind-science. ] [ Christian Science reveals incontrovertibly that Mind ] [ is All-in-all, that the only realities are the divine Mind ] [6Scientific evidence and idea. This great fact is not, however, seen ] [to be supported by sensible evidence, until its ] [divine Principle is demonstrated by healing the sick and ] [9thus proved absolute and divine. This proof once seen, ] [no other conclusion can be reached. ] [ For three years after my discovery, I sought the solu] [12tion of this problem of Mind-healing, searched the Scrip] [Solitary researchtures and read little else, kept aloof from so] [ciety, and devoted time and energies to dis] [15covering a positive rule. The search was sweet, calm, and ] [buoyant with hope, not selfish nor depressing. I knew ] [the Principle of all harmonious Mind-action to be God, ] [18and that cures were produced in primitive Christian ] [healing by holy, uplifting faith; but I must know the ] [Science of this healing, and I won my way to absolute ] [21conclusions through divine revelation, reason, and dem] [onstration. The revelation of Truth in the understand] [ing came to me gradually and apparently through divine ] [24power. When a new spiritual idea is borne to earth, the ] [prophetic Scripture of Isaiah is renewedly fulfilled: ] [\"Unto us a child is born, . . . and his name shall be ] [27called Wonderful.\" ] [ Jesus once said of his lessons: \"My doctrine is not ] [mine, but His that sent me. If any man will do His will, ] [30he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or ] [whether I speak of myself.\" (John vii. 16, 17.) ] [ The three great verities of Spirit, omnipotence, omni110] [110:1presence, omniscience, \u2014 Spirit possessing all power, ] [filling all space, constituting all Science, \u2014 contradict ] [3God's allness learnedforever the belief that matter can be actual. ] [These eternal verities reveal primeval exist] [ence as the radiant reality of God's creation, ] [6in which all that He has made is pronounced by His wis] [dom good. ] [ Thus it was that I beheld, as never before, the awful ] [9unreality called evil. The equipollence of God brought ] [to light another glorious proposition, \u2014 man's perfecti] [bility and the establishment of the kingdom of heaven on ] [12earth. ] [ In following these leadings of scientific revelation, ] [the Bible was my only textbook. The Scriptures were ] [15Scriptural foundationsillumined; reason and revelation were recon] [ciled, and afterwards the truth of Christian ] [Science was demonstrated. No human pen nor tongue ] [18taught me the Science contained in this book, Science ] [and Health; and neither tongue nor pen can over] [throw it. This book may be distorted by shallow criti] [21cism or by careless or malicious students, and its ideas ] [may be temporarily abused and misrepresented; but the ] [Science and truth therein will forever remain to be dis] [24cerned and demonstrated. ] [ Jesus demonstrated the power of Christian Science to ] [heal mortal minds and bodies. But this power was lost ] [27The demonstration lost and foundsight of, and must again be spiritually dis] [cerned, taught, and demonstrated according ] [to Christ's command, with \"signs following.\" ] [30Its Science must be apprehended by as many as believe ] [on Christ and spiritually understand Truth. ] [ No analogy exists between the vague hypotheses of 111 ] [111:1agnosticism, pantheism, theosophy, spiritualism, or Chris] [3Mystical antagoniststian Science; and I find the will, or sensuous ] [reason of the human mind, to be opposed to ] [the divine Mind as expressed through divine Science. ] [6 Christian Science is natural, but not physical. The ] [Science of God and man is no more supernatural than ] [Optical illustration of Scienceis the science of numbers, though departing ] [9from the realm of the physical, as the Science ] [of God, Spirit, must, some may deny its right to ] [the name of Science. The Principle of divine metaphysics ] [12is God; the practice of divine metaphysics is the utiliza] [tion of the power of Truth over error; its rules demon] [strate its Science. Divine metaphysics reverses perverted ] [15and physical hypotheses as to Deity, even as the ex] [planation of optics rejects the incidental or inverted ] [image and shows what this inverted image is meant to ] [18represent. ] [ A prize of one hundred pounds, offered in Oxford Uni] [versity, England, for the best essay on Natural Science, ] [21Pertinent proposal\u2014 an essay calculated to offset the tendency of ] [the age to attribute physical effects to physical ] [causes rather than to a final spiritual cause, \u2014 is one of ] [24many incidents which show that Christian Science meets ] [a yearning of the human race for spirituality. ] [ After a lengthy examination of my discovery and its ] [27demonstration in healing the sick, this fact became evi] [Confirmatory testsdent to me, \u2014 that Mind governs the body, ] [not partially but wholly. I submitted my ] [30metaphysical system of treating disease to the broad] [est practical tests. Since then this system has gradually ] [gained ground, and has proved itself, whenever scien112] [112:1tifically employed, to be the most effective curative agent ] [in medical practice. ] [3 Is there more than one school of Christian Science? ] [Christian Science is demonstrable. There can, there] [fore, be but one method in its teaching. Those who de] [6One school of Truthpart from this method forfeit their claims to ] [belong to its school, and they become adher] [ents of the Socratic, the Platonic, the Spencerian, or some ] [9other school. By this is meant that they adopt and ad] [here to some particular system of human opinions. Al] [though these opinions may have occasional gleams of ] [12divinity, borrowed from that truly divine Science which ] [eschews man-made systems, they nevertheless remain ] [wholly human in their origin and tendency and are not ] [15scientifically Christian. ] [ From the infinite One in Christian Science comes one ] [Principle and its infinite idea, and with this infinitude ] [18Unchanging Principlecome spiritual rules, laws, and their demon] [stration, which, like the great Giver, are \"the ] [same yesterday, and to-day, and forever;\" for thus are ] [21the divine Principle of healing and the Christ-idea charac] [terized in the epistle to the Hebrews. ] [ Any theory of Christian Science, which departs from ] [24what has already been stated and proved to be true, af] [On sandy foundationsfords no foundation upon which to establish ] [a genuine school of this Science. Also, if any ] [27so-called new school claims to be Christian Science, and ] [yet uses another author's discoveries without giving that ] [author proper credit, such a school is erroneous, for it ] [30inculcates a breach of that divine commandment in the ] [Hebrew Decalogue, \"Thou shalt not steal.\" ] [ God is the Principle of divine metaphysics. As there 113 ] [113:1is but one God, there can be but one divine Principle of ] [all Science; and there must be fixed rules for the demon] [3Principle and practicestration of this divine Principle. The letter ] [of Science plentifully reaches humanity to-day, ] [but its spirit comes only in small degrees. The vital part, ] [6the heart and soul of Christian Science, is Love. With] [out this, the letter is but the dead body of Science, \u2014 ] [pulseless, cold, inanimate. ] [9 The fundamental propositions of divine metaphysics ] [are summarized in the four following, to me, self-evident ] [Reversible propositions propositions. Even if reversed, these proposi] [12tions will be found to agree in statement and ] [proof, showing mathematically their exact relation to ] [Truth. De Quincey says mathematics has not a foot to ] [15stand upon which is not purely metaphysical. ] [18 3. God, Spirit, being all, nothing is matter. ] [ 4. Life, God, omnipotent good, deny death, evil, sin, ] [disease. \u2014 Disease, sin, evil, death, deny good, omnipo] [21tent God, Life. ] [ Which of the denials in proposition four is true? Both ] [are not, cannot be, true. According to the Scripture, ] [24I find that God is true, \"but every [mortal] man a ] [liar.\" ] [ The divine metaphysics of Christian Science, like the ] [27method in mathematics, proves the rule by inversion. ] [Metaphysical inversionsFor example: There is no pain in Truth, and ] [no truth in pain; no nerve in Mind, and no ] [30mind in nerve; no matter in Mind, and no mind in mat] [ter; no matter in Life, and no life in matter; no matter ] [in good, and no good in matter. ] [114:1 Usage classes both evil and good together as mind; ] [ therefore, to be understood, the author calls sick and sin] [3Definition of mortal mindful humanity mortal mind, \u2014 meaning by this ] [term the flesh opposed to Spirit, the human ] [mind and evil in contradistinction to the divine Mind, or ] [6Truth and good. The spiritually unscientific definition ] [of mind is based on the evidence of the physical senses, ] [which makes minds many and calls mind both human and ] [9divine. ] [ In Science, Mind is one, including noumenon and phe] [nomena, God and His thoughts. ] [12 Mortal mind is a solecism in language, and involves an ] [improper use of the word mind. As Mind is immortal, ] [Imperfect terminologythe phrase mortal mind implies something un] [15true and therefore unreal; and as the phrase ] [is used in teaching Christian Science, it is meant to ] [designate that which has no real existence. Indeed, if ] [18a better word or phrase could be suggested, it would ] [be used; but in expressing the new tongue we must ] [sometimes recur to the old and imperfect, and the new ] [21wine of the Spirit has to be poured into the old bottles of ] [the letter. ] [ Christian Science explains all cause and effect as men] [24tal, not physical. It lifts the veil of mystery from Soul and ] [Causation mentalbody. It shows the scientific relation of man ] [to God, disentangles the interlaced ambiguities ] [27of being, and sets free the imprisoned thought. In divine ] [Science, the universe, including man, is spiritual, harmoni] [ous, and eternal. Science shows that what is termed mat] [30ter is but the subjective state of what is termed by the ] [author mortal mind. ] [ Apart from the usual opposition to everything new, 115 ] [115:1the one great obstacle to the reception of that spiritual] [ity, through which the understanding of Mind-science ] [3Philological inadequacycomes, is the inadequacy of material terms for ] [metaphysical statements, and the consequent ] [difficulty of so expressing metaphysical ideas as to make ] [6them comprehensible to any reader, who has not person] [ally demonstrated Christian Science as brought forth in ] [my discovery. Job says: \"The ear trieth words, as the ] [9mouth tasteth meat.\" The great difficulty is to give the ] [right impression, when translating material terms back ] [into the original spiritual tongue. ] [Divine synonymsGod: Divine Principle, Life, Truth, Love, ] [Soul, Spirit, Mind. ] [15Divine imageMan: God's spiritual idea, individual, [fect, eternal. ] reflectionIdea: An image in Mind; the immediate ] [18object of understanding. \u2014 Webster. ] [21Physical. Evil beliefs, passions and appetites, fear, ] [depraved will, self-justification, pride, envy, de] [Unrealityceit, hatred, revenge, sin, sickness, disease, ] [24death. ] [Second Degree: Evil beliefs disappearing. ] [Transitional honesty, affection, com] [27passion, hope, faith, meekness, temperance. ] [ In the third degree mortal mind disappears, and man as ] [God's image appears. Science so reverses the evidence ] [6Spiritual universebefore the corporeal human senses, as to make ] [this Scriptural testimony true in our hearts, ] [\"The last shall be first, and the first last,\" so that God ] [9and His idea may be to us what divinity really is and ] [must of necessity be, \u2014 all-inclusive. ] [ A correct view of Christian Science and of its adapta] [12tion to healing includes vastly more than is at first seen. ] [Aim of ScienceWorks on metaphysics leave the grand point ] [untouched. They never crown the power of ] [15Mind as the Messiah, nor do they carry the day against ] [physical enemies, \u2014 even to the extinction of all belief in ] [matter, evil, disease, and death, \u2014 nor insist upon the fact ] [18that God is all, therefore that matter is nothing beyond an ] [image in mortal mind. ] [ Christian Science strongly emphasizes the thought that ] [21Divine personalityGod is not corporeal, but incorporeal, \u2014 that is, ] [bodiless. Mortals are corporeal, but God is ] [incorporeal. ] [24 As the words person and personal are commonly and ] [ignorantly employed, they often lead, when applied to ] [Deity, to confused and erroneous conceptions of divinity ] [27and its distinction from humanity. If the term personality, ] [as applied to God, means infinite personality, then God is ] [ infinite Person, \u2014 in the sense of infinite personality, but ] [30not in the lower sense. An infinite Mind in a finite form ] [is an absolute impossibility. ] [117:1 The term individuality is also open to objections, be] [cause an individual may be one of a series, one of many, ] [3as an individual man, an individual horse; whereas God ] [is One, \u2014 not one of a series, but one alone and without ] [an equal. ] [6 God is Spirit; therefore the language of Spirit must ] [be, and is, spiritual. Christian Science attaches no physi] [Spiritual languagecal nature and significance to the Supreme ] [9Being or His manifestation; mortals alone do ] [this. God's essential language is spoken of in the last ] [chapter of Mark's Gospel as the new tongue, the spir] [12itual meaning of which is attained through \"signs ] [following.\" ] [ Ear hath not heard, nor hath lip spoken, the pure lan] [15guage of Spirit. Our Master taught spirituality by simili] [The miracles of Jesustudes and parables. As a divine student he ] [unfolded God to man, illustrating and demon] [18strating Life and Truth in himself and by his power over ] [the sick and sinning. Human theories are inadequate to ] [interpret the divine Principle involved in the miracles ] [21(marvels) wrought by Jesus and especially in his mighty, ] [crowning, unparalleled, and triumphant exit from the ] [flesh. ] [24 Evidence drawn from the five physical senses relates ] [Opacity of the sensessolely to human reason; and because of opaci] [ty to the true light, human reason dimly re] [27flects and feebly transmits Jesus' works and words. Truth ] [ is a revelation. ] [ Jesus bade his disciples beware of the leaven of the ] [30Leaven of TruthPharisees and of the Sadducees, which he de] [fined as human doctrines. His parable of the ] [\"leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures 118 ] [118:1of meal, till the whole was leavened,\" impels the infer] [ence that the spiritual leaven signifies the Science of Christ ] [3and its spiritual interpretation, \u2014 an inference far above ] [the merely ecclesiastical and formal applications of the ] [illustration. ] [6 Did not this parable point a moral with a prophecy, ] [foretelling the second appearing in the flesh of the ] [Christ, Truth, hidden in sacred secrecy from the visi] [9ble world? ] [ Ages pass, but this leaven of Truth is ever at work. It ] [must destroy the entire mass of error, and so be eternally ] [12glorified in man's spiritual freedom. ] [ In their spiritual significance, Science, Theology, and ] [Medicine are means of divine thought, which include spirit] [15The divine and human contrastedual laws emanating from the invisible and in] [finite power and grace. The parable may ] [import that these spiritual laws, perverted by ] [18a perverse material sense of law, are metaphysically pre] [sented as three measures of meal, \u2014 that is, three modes ] [of mortal thought. In all mortal forms of thought, dust ] [21is dignified as the natural status of men and things, and ] [modes of material motion are honored with the name of ] [laws. This continues until the leaven of Spirit changes ] [24the whole of mortal thought, as yeast changes the chemical ] [properties of meal. ] [ The definitions of material law, as given by natural ] [27science, represent a kingdom necessarily divided against ] [Certain contradictionsitself, because these definitions portray law as ] [physical, not spiritual. Therefore they con] [30tradict the divine decrees and violate the law of Love, in ] [which nature and God are one and the natural order of ] [heaven comes down to earth. ] [119:1 When we endow matter with vague spiritual power, \u2014 ] [that is, when we do so in our theories, for of course we ] [3Unescapable dilemmacannot really endow matter with what it does ] [not and cannot possess, \u2014 we disown the Al] [mighty, for such theories lead to one of two things. They ] [6either presuppose the self-evolution and self-government ] [of matter, or else they assume that matter is the product ] [of Spirit. To seize the first horn of this dilemma and con] [9sider matter as a power in and of itself, is to leave the cre] [ator out of His own universe; while to grasp the other ] [horn of the dilemma and regard God as the creator of ] [12matter, is not only to make Him responsible for all disas] [ters, physical and moral, but to announce Him as their ] [source, thereby making Him guilty of maintaining perpet] [15ual misrule in the form and under the name of natural ] [law. ] [ In one sense God is identical with nature, but this na] [18ture is spiritual and is not expressed in matter. The law] [God and naturegiver, whose lightning palsies or prostrates in ] [death the child at prayer, is not the divine ideal ] [21of omnipresent Love. God is natural good, and is repre] [sented only by the idea of goodness; while evil should be ] [regarded as unnatural, because it is opposed to the nature ] [24of Spirit, God. ] [ In viewing the sunrise, one finds that it contradicts ] [the evidence before the senses to believe that the earth ] [27The sun and Soulis in motion and the sun at rest. As astron] [omy reverses the human perception of the ] [movement of the solar system, so Christian Science re] [30verses the seeming relation of Soul and body and makes ] [body tributary to Mind. Thus it is with man, who ] [is but the humble servant of the restful Mind, though it 120 ] [120:1seems otherwise to finite sense. But we shall never under] [stand this while we admit that soul is in body or mind in ] [3matter, and that man is included in non-intelligence. ] [Soul, or Spirit, is God, unchangeable and eternal; and ] [man coexists with and reflects Soul, God, for man is God's ] [6image. ] [ Science reverses the false testimony of the physical ] [senses, and by this reversal mortals arrive at the funda] [9Reversal of testimonymental facts of being. Then the question in] [evitably arises: Is a man sick if the material ] [senses indicate that he is in good health? No! for matter ] [12can make no conditions for man. And is he well if the ] [senses say he is sick? Yes, he is well in Science in which ] [health is normal and disease is abnormal. ] [15 Health is not a condition of matter, but of Mind; nor ] [can the material senses bear reliable testimony on the sub] [Health and the sensesject of health. The Science of Mind-healing ] [18shows it to be impossible for aught but Mind ] [ to testify truly or to exhibit the real status of man. There] [fore the divine Principle of Science, reversing the testi] [21mony of the physical senses, reveals man as harmoniously ] [existent in Truth, which is the only basis of health; and ] [thus Science denies all disease, heals the sick, overthrows ] [24false evidence, and refutes materialistic logic. ] [ Any conclusion pro or con, deduced from supposed sen] [sation in matter or from matter's supposed consciousness ] [27of health or disease, instead of reversing the testimony of ] [the physical senses, confirms that testimony as legitimate ] [and so leads to disease. ] [30 When Columbus gave freer breath to the Historic illustrations ] [globe, ignorance and superstition chained the ] [limbs of the brave old navigator, and disgrace and star121] [121:1vation stared him in the face; but sterner still would have ] [been his fate, if his discovery had undermined the favor] [3ite inclinations of a sensuous philosophy. ] [ Copernicus mapped out the stellar system, and before ] [he spake, astrography was chaotic, and the heavenly fields ] [6were incorrectly explored. ] [ The Chaldean Wisemen read in the stars the fate of ] [empires and the fortunes of men. Though no higher ] [9Perennial beautyrevelation than the horoscope was to them dis] [played upon the empyrean, earth and heaven ] [were bright, and bird and blossom were glad in God's ] [12perennial and happy sunshine, golden with Truth. So ] [we have goodness and beauty to gladden the heart; but ] [man, left to the hypotheses of material sense unexplained ] [15by Science, is as the wandering comet or the desolate ] [star \u2014 \"a weary searcher for a viewless home.\" ] [ The earth's diurnal rotation is invisible to the physical ] [18eye, and the sun seems to move from east to west, instead ] [Astronomic unfoldingsof the earth from west to east. Until rebuked ] [by clearer views of the everlasting facts, this ] [21false testimony of the eye deluded the judgment and in] [duced false conclusions. Science shows appearances often ] [to be erroneous, and corrects these errors by the simple ] [24rule that the greater controls the lesser. The sun is the ] [central stillness, so far as our solar system is concerned, ] [and the earth revolves about the sun once a year, besides ] [27turning daily on its own axis. ] [ As thus indicated, astronomical order imitates the ] [action of divine Principle; and the universe, the reflec] [30tion of God, is thus brought nearer the spiritual fact, and ] [is allied to divine Science as displayed in the everlasting ] [government of the universe. ] [122:1 The evidence of the physical senses often reverses the ] [real Science of being, and so creates a reign of discord, \u2014 ] [3Opposing testimonyassigning seeming power to sin, sickness, and ] [death; but the great facts of Life, rightly un] [derstood, defeat this triad of errors, contradict their false ] [6witnesses, and reveal the kingdom of heaven, \u2014 the actual ] [reign of harmony on earth. The material senses' re] [versal of the Science of Soul was practically exposed nine] [9teen hundred years ago by the demonstrations of Jesus; ] [yet these so-called senses still make mortal mind tributary ] [to mortal body, and ordain certain sections of matter, such ] [12as brain and nerves, as the seats of pain and pleasure, ] [from which matter reports to this so-called mind its status ] [of happiness or misery. ] [15 The optical focus is another proof of the illusion of ] [material sense. On the eye's retina, sky and tree-tops ] [Testimony of the sensesapparently join hands, clouds and ocean meet ] [18and mingle. The barometer, \u2014 that little ] [prophet of storm and sunshine, denying the testimony of ] [the senses, \u2014 points to fair weather in the midst of murky ] [21clouds and drenching rain. Experience is full of instances ] [of similar illusions, which every thinker can recall for ] [himself. ] [24 To material sense, the severance of the jugular vein ] [Spiritual sense of lifetakes away life; but to spiritual sense and ] [in Science, Life goes on unchanged and ] [27being is eternal. Temporal life is a false sense of ] [existence. ] [ Our theories make the same mistake regarding Soul ] [30 and body that Ptolemy made regarding the solar system. ] [They insist that soul is in body and mind therefore tribu] [tary to matter. Astronomical science has destroyed the 123 ] [123:1false theory as to the relations of the celestial bodies, and ] [Christian Science will surely destroy the greater error as ] [3Ptolemaic and psychical errorto our terrestrial bodies. The true idea and ] [Principle of man will then appear. The Ptole] [maic blunder could not affect the harmony of ] [6being as does the error relating to soul and body, which ] [reverses the order of Science and assigns to matter the ] [power and prerogative of Spirit, so that man becomes ] [9the most absolutely weak and inharmonious creature in ] [the universe. ] [ The verity of Mind shows conclusively how it is that ] [12Seeming and beingmatter seems to be, but is not. Divine Science, ] [rising above physical theories, excludes matter, ] [resolves things into thoughts, and replaces the objects of ] [15material sense with spiritual ideas. ] [ The term Christian Science was introduced by ] [the author to designate the scientific system of divine ] [18healing. ] [ The revelation consists of two parts: ] [ 1. The discovery of this divine Science of Mind-] [21healing, through a spiritual sense of the Scriptures and ] [through the teachings of the Comforter, as promised by ] [the Master. ] [24 2. The proof, by present demonstration, that the so-] [called miracles of Jesus did not specially belong to a ] [dispensation now ended, but that they illustrated an ] [27ever-operative divine Principle. The operation of this ] [Principle indicates the eternality of the scientific order ] [and continuity of being. ] Scientific basis [30 Christian Science differs from material sci] [ence, but not on that account is it less scien] [tific. On the contrary, Christian Science is pre-emi124] [124:1nently scientific, being based on Truth, the Principle of ] [all science. ] [3 Physical science (so-called) is human knowledge, \u2014 a ] [law of mortal mind, a blind belief, a Samson shorn of his ] [Physical science a blind beliefstrength. When this human belief lacks organ] [6izations to support it, its foundations are gone. ] [Having neither moral might, spiritual basis, ] [nor holy Principle of its own, this belief mistakes effect ] [9for cause and seeks to find life and intelligence in matter, ] [thus limiting Life and holding fast to discord and death. ] [In a word, human belief is a blind conclusion from material ] [12reasoning. This is a mortal, finite sense of things, which ] [immortal Spirit silences forever. ] [ The universe, like man, is to be interpreted by Science ] [15from its divine Principle, God, and then it can be under] [Right interpretationstood; but when explained on the basis of ] [physical sense and represented as subject to ] [18growth, maturity, and decay, the universe, like man, is, ] [and must continue to be, an enigma. ] [ Adhesion, cohesion, and attraction are properties of ] [21Mind. They belong to divine Principle, and support ] [All force mentalthe equipoise of that thought-force, which ] [launched the earth in its orbit and said to the ] [24proud wave, \"Thus far and no farther.\" ] [ Spirit is the life, substance, and continuity of all ] [things. We tread on forces. Withdraw them, and ] [27creation must collapse. Human knowledge calls them ] [forces of matter; but divine Science declares that they ] [belong wholly to divine Mind, are inherent in this ] [30Mind, and so restores them to their rightful home and ] [classification. ] [ The elements and functions of the physical body and 125 ] [125:1of the physical world will change as mortal mind changes ] [its beliefs. What is now considered the best condition ] [3Corporeal changesfor organic and functional health in the human ] [body may no longer be found indispensable ] [to health. Moral conditions will be found always har] [6monious and health-giving. Neither organic inaction ] [nor overaction is beyond God's control; and man will ] [be found normal and natural to changed mortal thought, ] [9and therefore more harmonious in his manifestations than ] [he was in the prior states which human belief created and ] [sanctioned. ] [12 As human thought changes from one stage to an] [other of conscious pain and painlessness, sorrow and ] [joy, \u2014 from fear to hope and from faith to understand] [15ing, \u2014 the visible manifestation will at last be man gov] [erned by Soul, not by material sense. Reflecting God's ] [government, man is self-governed. When subordinate ] [18to the divine Spirit, man cannot be controlled by sin or ] [death, thus proving our material theories about laws of ] [health to be valueless. ] [21 The seasons will come and go with changes of time and ] [tide, cold and heat, latitude and longitude. The agri] [The time and tideculturist will find that these changes cannot ] [24affect his crops. \"As a vesture shalt Thou ] [ change them and they shall be changed.\" The mariner ] [will have dominion over the atmosphere and the great ] [27deep, over the fish of the sea and the fowls of the air. ] [The astronomer will no longer look up to the stars, \u2014 ] [he will look out from them upon the universe; and the ] [30florist will find his flower before its seed. ] [ Thus matter will finally be proved nothing more ] [than a mortal belief, wholly inadequate to affect a man 126 ] [126:1through its supposed organic action or supposed exist] [ence. Error will be no longer used in stating truth. The ] [3Mortal nothingnessproblem of nothingness, or \"dust to dust,\" will ] [be solved, and mortal mind will be without ] [form and void, for mortality will cease when man beholds ] [6himself God's reflection, even as man sees his reflection ] [in a glass. ] [ All Science is divine. Human thought never pro] [9jected the least portion of true being. Human belief ] [A lack of originalityhas sought and interpreted in its own way ] [the echo of Spirit, and so seems to have ] [12reversed it and repeated it materially; but the human ] [mind never produced a real tone nor sent forth a positive ] [sound. ] [15 The point at issue between Christian Science on the ] [one hand and popular theology on the other is this: Shall ] [Antagonistic questionsScience explain cause and effect as being ] [18both natural and spiritual? Or shall all that ] [is beyond the cognizance of the material senses be called ] [supernatural, and be left to the mercy of speculative ] [21hypotheses? ] [ I have set forth Christian Science and its application ] [to the treatment of disease just as I have discovered them. ] [24Biblical basisI have demonstrated through Mind the effects ] [of Truth on the health, longevity, and morals ] [of men; and I have found nothing in ancient or in modern ] [27systems on which to found my own, except the teachings ] [and demonstrations of our great Master and the lives of ] [prophets and apostles. The Bible has been my only au] [30thority. I have had no other guide in \"the straight and ] [narrow way\" of Truth. ] [ If Christendom resists the author's application of the 127 ] [127:1word Science to Christianity, or questions her use of the ] [word Science, she will not therefore lose faith in Chris] [3Science and Christianitytianity, nor will Christianity lose its hold upon ] [her. If God, the All-in-all, be the creator of ] [the spiritual universe, including man, then everything ] [6entitled to a classification as truth, or Science, must be ] [comprised in a knowledge or understanding of God, for ] [there can be nothing beyond illimitable divinity. ] [9 The terms Divine Science, Spiritual Science, Christ ] [Science or Christian Science, or Science alone, she em] [Scientific termsploys interchangeably, according to the re] [12quirements of the context. These synony] [mous terms stand for everything relating to God, the in] [finite, supreme, eternal Mind. It may be said, however, ] [15that the term Christian Science relates especially to ] [Science as applied to humanity. Christian Science re] [veals God, not as the author of sin, sickness, and death, ] [18but as divine Principle, Supreme Being, Mind, exempt ] [from all evil. It teaches that matter is the falsity, not ] [the fact, of existence; that nerves, brain, stomach, lungs, ] [21and so forth, have \u2014 as matter \u2014 no intelligence, life, nor ] [sensation. ] [ There is no physical science, inasmuch as all truth ] [24proceeds from the divine Mind. Therefore truth is not ] [No physical sciencehuman, and is not a law of matter, for matter ] [is not a lawgiver. Science is an emanation of ] [27divine Mind, and is alone able to interpret God aright. ] [It has a spiritual, and not a material origin. It is a divine ] [utterance, \u2014 the Comforter which leadeth into all truth. ] [30 Christian Science eschews what is called natural science, ] [in so far as this is built on the false hypotheses that matter ] [is its own lawgiver, that law is founded on material con128] [128:1ditions, and that these are final and overrule the might of ] [divine Mind. Good is natural and primitive. It is not ] [3miraculous to itself. ] [ The term Science, properly understood, refers only to ] [the laws of God and to His government of the universe, ] [6Practical Scienceinclusive of man. From this it follows that ] [business men and cultured scholars have found ] [that Christian Science enhances their endurance and ] [9mental powers, enlarges their perception of character, ] [gives them acuteness and comprehensiveness and an ] [ability to exceed their ordinary capacity. The human ] [12mind, imbued with this spiritual understanding, becomes ] [more elastic, is capable of greater endurance, escapes ] [somewhat from itself, and requires less repose. A knowl] [15edge of the Science of being develops the latent abilities ] [and possibilities of man. It extends the atmosphere of ] [thought, giving mortals access to broader and higher ] [18realms. It raises the thinker into his native air of insight ] [and perspicacity. ] [ An odor becomes beneficent and agreeable only in pro] [21portion to its escape into the surrounding atmosphere. ] [So it is with our knowledge of Truth. If one would ] [not quarrel with his fellow-man for waking him from ] [24a cataleptic nightmare, he should not resist Truth, which ] [banishes \u2014 yea, forever destroys with the higher testi] [mony of Spirit \u2014 the so-called evidence of matter. ] [27 Science relates to Mind, not matter. It rests on fixed ] [Principle and not upon the judgment of false sensation. ] [Mathematics and scientific logicThe addition of two sums in mathematics must ] [30always bring the same result. So is it with ] [logic. If both the major and the minor propo] [sitions of a syllogism are correct, the conclusion, if properly 129 ] [129:1drawn, cannot be false. So in Christian Science there ] [are no discords nor contradictions, because its logic is as ] [3harmonious as the reasoning of an accurately stated syl] [logism or of a properly computed sum in arithmetic. ] [Truth is ever truthful, and can tolerate no error in ] [6premise or conclusion. ] [ If you wish to know the spiritual fact, you can dis] [Truth by inversioncover it by reversing the material fable, be the ] [9fable pro or con, \u2014 be it in accord with your ] [preconceptions or utterly contrary to them. ] [ Pantheism may be defined as a belief in the intelli] [12gence of matter, \u2014 a belief which Science overthrows. ] [Antagonistic theoriesIn those days there will be \"great tribulation ] [such as was not since the beginning of the ] [15world;\" and earth will echo the cry, \"Art thou [Truth] ] [come hither to torment hypnotism, spiritualism, theosophy, agnos] infidelity are to true ] [being and fatal to its demonstration; and so are some ] [other systems. ] [21 We must abandon pharmaceutics, and take up ontol] [ogy, \u2014 \"the science of real being.\" We must look deep ] [Ontology neededinto realism instead of accepting only the out] [24ward sense of things. Can we gather peaches ] [from a pine-tree, or learn from discord the concord of ] [being? Yet quite as rational are some of the leading ] [27illusions along the path which Science must tread in its ] [reformatory mission among mortals. The very name, ] [illusion, points to nothingness. ] [30 The generous liver may object to the author's small ] [estimate of the pleasures of the table. The sinner sees, ] [in the system taught in this book, that the demands of 130 ] [130:1God must be met. The petty intellect is alarmed by con] [stant appeals to Mind. The licentious disposition is dis] [3Reluctant guestscouraged over its slight spiritual prospects. ] [When all men are bidden to the feast, the ex] [cuses come. One has a farm, another has merchandise, ] [6and therefore they cannot accept. ] [ It is vain to speak dishonestly of divine Science, which ] [Excuses for ignorancedestroys all discord, when you can demonstrate ] [9the actuality of Science. It is unwise to doubt ] [if reality is in perfect harmony with God, divine Principle, ] [\u2014 if Science, when understood and demonstrated, will ] [12destroy all discord, \u2014 since you admit that God is om] [nipotent; for from this premise it follows that good and ] [its sweet concords have all-power. ] [15 Christian Science, properly understood, would dis] [abuse the human mind of material beliefs which war ] [Children and adultsagainst spiritual facts; and these material ] [18beliefs must be denied and cast out to make ] [place for truth. You cannot add to the contents of a ] [vessel already full. Laboring long to shake the adult's ] [21faith in matter and to inculcate a grain of faith in God, \u2014 ] [an inkling of the ability of Spirit to make the body har] [monious, \u2014 the author has often remembered our Master's ] [24love for little children, and understood how truly such as ] [they belong to the heavenly kingdom. ] [ If thought is startled at the strong claim of Science ] [27for the supremacy of God, or Truth, and doubts the su] [All evil unnaturalpremacy of good, ought we not, contrari] [wise, to be astounded at the vigorous claims ] [30of evil and doubt them, and no longer think it natural to ] [love sin and unnatural to forsake it, \u2014 no longer imagine ] [evil to be ever-present and good absent? Truth should 131 ] [131:1not seem so surprising and unnatural as error, and error ] [should not seem so real as truth. Sickness should not seem ] [3so real as health. There is no error in Science, and our ] [lives must be governed by reality in order to be in har] [mony with God, the divine Principle of all being. ] [6 When once destroyed by divine Science, the false evi] [dence before the corporeal senses disappears. Hence the ] [The error of carnalityopposition of sensuous man to the Science of ] [9Soul and the significance of the Scripture, \"The ] [carnal mind is enmity against God.\" The central fact of ] [the Bible is the superiority of spiritual over physical power. ] [ Must Christian Science come through the Christian ] [churches as some persons insist? This Science has come ] [15Churchly neglectalready, after the manner of God's appoint] [ing, but the churches seem not ready to re] [ceive it, according to the Scriptural saying, \"He came ] [18unto his own, and his own received him not.\" Jesus once ] [said: \"I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and ] [earth, that Thou hast hid these things from the wise ] [21and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even ] [so, Father, for so it seemed good in Thy sight.\" As afore] [time, the spirit of the Christ, which taketh away the cere] [24monies and doctrines of men, is not accepted until the ] [hearts of men are made ready for it. ] [ The mission of Jesus confirmed prophecy, and ex] [27plained the so-called miracles of olden time as natural ] [John the Baptist, and the Messiahdemonstrations of the divine power, demonstra] [tions which were not understood. Jesus' works ] [30established his claim to the Messiahship. In ] [reply to John's inquiry, \"Art thou he that should come,\" 132 ] [132:1Jesus returned an affirmative reply, recounting his works ] [instead of referring to his doctrine, confident that this ] [3exhibition of the divine power to heal would fully an] [swer the question. Hence his reply: \"Go and show ] [John again those things which ye do hear and see: the ] [6blind receive their sight and the lame walk, the lepers ] [are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, ] [and the poor have the gospel preached to them. And ] [9blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.\" In ] [other words, he gave his benediction to any one who ] [should not deny that such effects, coming from divine ] [12Mind, prove the unity of God, \u2014 the divine Principle ] [which brings out all harmony. ] [ The Pharisees of old thrust the spiritual idea and the ] [15man who lived it out of their synagogues, and retained ] [Christ rejectedtheir materialistic beliefs about God. Jesus' ] [system of healing received no aid nor approval ] [18from other sanitary or religious systems, from doctrines ] [of physics or of divinity; and it has not yet been gener] [ally accepted. To-day, as of yore, unconscious of the ] [21reappearing of the spiritual idea, blind belief shuts the ] [door upon it, and condemns the cure of the sick and sin] [ning if it is wrought on any but a material and a doctrinal ] [24theory. Anticipating this rejection of idealism, of the ] [true idea of God, \u2014 this salvation from all error, physi] [cal and mental, \u2014 Jesus asked, \"When the Son of man ] [27cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?\" ] [ Did the doctrines of John the Baptist confer healing ] [power upon him, or endow him with the truest concep] [30John's misgivingstion of the Christ? This righteous preacher ] [once pointed his disciples to Jesus as \"the ] [Lamb of God;\" yet afterwards he seriously questioned 133 ] [133:1the signs of the Messianic appearing, and sent the inquiry ] [to Jesus, \"Art thou he that should come?\" ] [3 Was John's faith greater than that of the Samaritan ] [Faith according to workswoman, who said, \"Is not this the Christ?\" ] [There was also a certain centurion of whose ] [6faith Jesus himself declared, \"I have not found so great ] [faith, no, not in Israel.\" ] [ In Egypt, it was Mind which saved the Israelites from ] [9belief in the plagues. In the wilderness, streams flowed ] [from the rock, and manna fell from the sky. The Israelites ] [looked upon the brazen serpent, and straightway believed ] [12that they were healed of the poisonous stings of vipers. ] [In national prosperity, miracles attended the successes of ] [the Hebrews; but when they departed from the true ] [15idea, their demoralization began. Even in captivity ] [among foreign nations, the divine Principle wrought ] [wonders for the people of God in the fiery furnace and ] [18in kings' palaces. ] [ Judaism was the antithesis of Christianity, because ] [Judaism engendered the limited form of a national or ] [21Judaism antipathetictribal religion. It was a finite and material ] [system, carried out in special theories concern] [ing God, man, sanitary methods, and a religious cultus. ] [24That he made \"himself equal with God,\" was one of the ] [Jewish accusations against him who planted Christianity ] [on the foundation of Spirit, who taught as he was in] [27spired by the Father and would recognize no life, intelli] [gence, nor substance outside of God. ] [ The Jewish conception of God, as Yawah, Jehovah, ] [30Priestly learningor only a mighty hero and king, has not quite ] [given place to the true knowledge of God. ] [Creeds and rituals have not cleansed their hands of 134 ] [134:1rabbinical lore. To-day the cry of bygone ages is re] [peated, \"Crucify him!\" At every advancing step, truth ] [3is still opposed with sword and spear. ] [ The word martyr, from the Greek, means witness; but ] [those who testified for Truth were so often persecuted ] [6Testimony of martyrsunto death, that at length the word martyr ] [ was narrowed in its significance and so has ] [come always to mean one who suffers for his convictions. ] [9The new faith in the Christ, Truth, so roused the hatred ] [of the opponents of Christianity, that the followers of ] [Christ were burned, crucified, and otherwise persecuted; ] [12and so it came about that human rights were hallowed ] [by the gallows and the cross. ] [ Man-made doctrines are waning. They have not waxed ] [15strong in times of trouble. Devoid of the Christ-power, ] [Absence of Christ-powerhow can they illustrate the doctrines of Christ ] [or the miracles of grace? Denial of the possi] [18bility of Christian healing robs Christianity of the very ] [element, which gave it divine force and its astonishing and ] [unequalled success in the first century. ] [21 The true Logos is demonstrably Christian Science, the ] [natural law of harmony which overcomes discord, \u2014 not ] [Basis of miraclesbecause this Science is supernatural or pre] [24ternatural, nor because it is an infraction of ] [divine law, but because it is the immutable law of God, ] [good. Jesus said: \"I knew that Thou hearest me al] [27ways;\" and he raised Lazarus from the dead, stilled the ] [tempest, healed the sick, walked on the water. There ] [is divine authority for believing in the superiority of ] [30spiritual power over material resistance. ] [ A miracle fulfils God's law, but does not violate that ] [law. This fact at present seems more mysterious than 135 ] [135:1the miracle itself. The Psalmist sang: Ye mountains, ] [that ye skipped like rams, and ye little hills, ] [like lambs? Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the ] [6Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob.\" The miracle ] [introduces no disorder, but unfolds the primal order, ] [establishing the Science of God's unchangeable law. ] [9Spiritual evolution alone is worthy of the exercise of ] [divine power. ] [ The same power which heals sin heals also sickness. ] [12This is \"the beauty of holiness,\" that when Truth heals ] [Fear and sickness identicalthe sick, it casts out evils, and when Truth ] [ casts out the evil called disease, it heals the ] [15sick. When Christ cast out the devil of ] [dumbness, \"it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, ] [the dumb spake.\" There is to-day danger of repeating ] [18the offence of the Jews by limiting the Holy One of Israel ] [and asking: \"Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?\" ] [What cannot God do? ] [21 It has been said, and truly, that Christianity must be ] [Science, and Science must be Christianity, else one or the ] [The unity of Science and Christianityother is false and useless; but neither is unim] [24portant or untrue, and they are alike in demon] [stration. This proves the one to be identical ] [with the other. Christianity as Jesus taught it was not ] [27a creed, nor a system of ceremonies, nor a special gift ] [from a ritualistic Jehovah; but it was the demonstration ] [of divine Love casting out error and healing the sick, ] [30not merely in the name of Christ, or Truth, but in demon] [stration of Truth, as must be the case in the cycles of ] [divine light. ] [136:1 Jesus established his church and maintained his mission ] [on a spiritual foundation of Christ-healing. He taught ] [3The Christ-missionhis followers that his religion had a divine ] [Principle, which would cast out error and heal ] [both the sick and the sinning. He claimed no intelli] [6gence, action, nor life separate from God. Despite the ] [persecution this brought upon him, he used his divine ] [power to save men both bodily and spiritually. ] [9 The question then as now was, How did Jesus heal the ] [sick? His answer to this question the world rejected. ] [Ancient spiritualismHe appealed to his students: \"Whom do ] [12men say that I, the Son of man, am?\" That ] [is: Who or what is it that is thus identified with casting ] [out evils and healing the sick? They replied, \"Some ] [15say that thou art John the Baptist; some, Elias; and ] [others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.\" These prophets ] [were considered dead, and this reply may indicate that ] [18some of the people believed that Jesus was a medium, ] [controlled by the spirit of John or of Elias. ] [ This ghostly fancy was repeated by Herod himself. ] [21That a wicked king and debauched husband should have ] [no high appreciation of divine Science and the great work ] [of the Master, was not surprising; for how could such ] [24a sinner comprehend what the disciples did not fully ] [understand? But even Herod doubted if Jesus was con] [trolled by the sainted preacher. Hence Herod's I beheaded: but who is this?\" No ] [wonder Herod desired to see the new Teacher. ] [ The disciples apprehended their Master better than ] [30Doubting disciplesdid others; but they did not comprehend all ] [that he said and did, or they would not have ] [questioned him so often. Jesus patiently persisted in 137 ] [137:1teaching and demonstrating the truth of being. His stu] [dents saw this power of Truth heal the sick, cast out evil, ] [3raise the dead; but the ultimate of this wonderful work ] [was not spiritually discerned, even by them, until after the ] [crucifixion, when their immaculate Teacher stood before ] [6them, the victor over sickness, sin, disease, death, and ] [the grave. ] [ Yearning to be understood, the Master repeated, ] [9\"But whom say ye that I am?\" This renewed inquiry ] [meant: Who or what is it that is able to do the work, so ] [mysterious to the popular mind? In his rejection of the ] [12answer already given and his renewal of the question, ] [it is plain that Jesus completely eschewed the narrow ] [opinion implied in their citation of the common report ] [15about him. ] [ With his usual impetuosity, Simon replied for his ] [brethren, and his reply set forth a great fact: \"Thou ] [18A divine responseart the Christ, the Son of the living God!\" ] [That is: The Messiah is what thou hast de] [clared, \u2014 Christ, the spirit of God, of Truth, Life, and ] [21Love, which heals mentally. This assertion elicited from ] [Jesus the benediction, \"Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-] [jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, ] [24but my Father which is in heaven;\" that is, Love hath ] [shown thee the way of Life! ] [ Before this the impetuous disciple had been called ] [27only by his common names, Simon Bar-jona, or son of ] [The true and living rockJona; but now the Master gave him a spir] [itual name in these words: \"And I say also ] [30unto thee, That thou art Peter; and upon this rock [the ] [meaning of the Greek word petros, or stone] I will build ] [my church; and the gates of hell [hades, the under-138] [138:1world, or the grave] shall not prevail against it.\" In ] [other words, Jesus purposed founding his society, not ] [3on the personal Peter as a mortal, but on the God-] [power which lay behind Peter's confession of the true ] [Messiah. ] [6 It was now evident to Peter that divine Life, Truth, and ] [Love, and not a human personality, was the healer of the ] [Sublime summarysick and a rock, a firm foundation in the realm ] [9of harmony. On this spiritually scientific basis ] [Jesus explained his cures, which appeared miraculous to ] [outsiders. He showed that diseases were cast out neither ] [12by corporeality, by materia medica, nor by hygiene, but by ] [the divine Spirit, casting out the errors of mortal mind. ] [The supremacy of Spirit was the foundation on which ] [15Jesus built. His sublime summary points to the religion ] [of Love. ] [ Jesus established in the Christian era the precedent for ] [18all Christianity, theology, and healing. Christians are ] [New era in Jesusunder as direct orders now, as they were then, ] [to be Christlike, to possess the Christ-spirit, to ] [21follow the Christ-example, and to heal the sick as well as ] [the sinning. It is easier for Christianity to cast out sick] [ness than sin, for the sick are more willing to part with ] [24pain than are sinners to give up the sinful, so-called pleas] [ure of the senses. The Christian can prove this to-day as ] [readily as it was proved centuries ago. ] [27 Our Master said to every follower: \"Go ye into all the ] [world, and preach the gospel to every thy neighbor as ] [30thyself!\" It was this theology of Jesus which ] [healed the sick and the sinning. It is his theology in this ] [book and the spiritual meaning of this theology, which 139 ] [139:1heals the sick and causes the wicked to \"forsake his way, ] [and the unrighteous man his thoughts.\" It was our Mas] [3ter's theology which the impious sought to destroy. ] [ From beginning to end, the Scriptures are full of ] [accounts of the triumph of Spirit, Mind, over matter. ] [6Marvels and reformationsMoses proved the power of Mind by what men ] [called miracles; so did Joshua, Elijah, and ] [Elisha. The Christian era was ushered in with signs and ] [9wonders. Reforms have commonly been attended with ] [bloodshed and persecution, even when the end has been ] [brightness and peace; but the present new, yet old, re] [12form in religious faith will teach men patiently and wisely ] [to stem the tide of sectarian bitterness, whenever it flows ] [inward. ] [15 The decisions by vote of Church Councils as to what ] [should and should not be considered Holy Writ; the man] [Science obscuredifest mistakes in the ancient versions; the ] [18thirty thousand different readings in the Old ] [Testament, and the three hundred thousand in the New, ] [\u2014 these facts show how a mortal and material sense stole ] [21into the divine record, with its own hue darkening to some ] [extent the inspired pages. But mistakes could neither ] [wholly obscure the divine Science of the Scriptures seen ] [24from Genesis to Revelation, mar the demonstration of ] [ Jesus, nor annul the healing by the prophets, who foresaw ] [that \"the stone which the builders rejected\" would be] [27come head of the corner.\" Atheism, pantheism, theosophy, and agnosticism are ] [opposed to Christian Science, as they are to ordinary re] [30Opponents benefitedligion; but it does not follow that the profane ] [or atheistic invalid cannot be healed by Chris] [tian Science. The moral condition of such a man de140] [140:1mands the remedy of Truth more than it is needed in most ] [cases; and Science is more than usually effectual in the ] [3treatment of moral ailments. ] [ That God is a corporeal being, nobody can truly affirm. ] [The Bible represents Him as saying: \"Thou canst not ] [6God invisible to the sensessee My face; for there shall no man see Me, ] [and live.\" Not materially but spiritually we ] [know Him as divine Mind, as Life, Truth, and Love. We ] [9shall obey and adore in proportion as we apprehend the ] [divine nature and love Him understandingly, warring no ] [more over the corporeality, but rejoicing in the affluence ] [12of our God. Religion will then be of the heart and not of ] [the head. Mankind will no longer be tyrannical and pro] [scriptive from lack of love, \u2014 straining out gnats and ] [15swallowing camels. ] [ We worship spiritually, only as we cease to worship ] [materially. Spiritual devoutness is the soul of Chris] [18The true worshiptianity. Worshipping through the medium of ] [matter is paganism. Judaic and other rituals ] [are but types and shadows of true worship. \"The true ] [21worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in ] [truth.\" ] [ The Jewish tribal Jehovah was a man-projected God, ] [24liable to wrath, repentance, and human changeableness. ] [Anthropo] [morphismThe Christian Science God is universal, eter] [nal, divine Love, which changeth not and caus] [27eth no evil, disease, nor death. It is indeed mournfully ] [true that the older Scripture is reversed. In the begin] [ning God created man in His, God's, image; but mor] [30tals would procreate man, and make God in their own ] [human image. What is the god of a mortal, but a mortal ] [magnified? ] [141:1 This indicates the distance between the theological and ] [ritualistic religion of the ages and the truth preached by ] [3More than profession requiredJesus. More than profession is requisite for ] [Christian demonstration. Few understand or ] [adhere to Jesus' divine precepts for living and ] [6healing. Why? Because his precepts require the disci] [ple to cut off the right hand and pluck out the right eye, ] [\u2014 that is, to set aside even the most cherished beliefs ] [9and practices, to leave all for Christ. ] [ All revelation (such is the popular thought!) must come ] [from the schools and along the line of scholarly and eccle] [12No ecclesiastical monopolysiastical descent, as kings are crowned from a ] [royal dynasty. In healing the sick and sinning, ] [Jesus elaborated the fact that the healing effect ] [15followed the understanding of the divine Principle and ] [of the Christ-spirit which governed the corporeal Jesus. ] [For this Principle there is no dynasty, no ecclesiastical ] [18monopoly. Its only crowned head is immortal sover] [eignty. Its only priest is the spiritualized man. The ] [Bible declares that all believers are made \"kings and ] [21priests unto God.\" The outsiders did not then, and ] [do not now, understand this ruling of the Christ; there] [fore they cannot demonstrate God's healing power. ] [24Neither can this manifestation of Christ be com] [prehended, until its divine Principle is scientifically ] [understood. ] [27 The adoption of scientific religion and of divine heal] [ing will ameliorate sin, sickness, and death. Let our ] [A change demandedpulpits do justice to Christian Science. Let ] [30it have fair representation by the press. Give ] [to it the place in our institutions of learning now occu] [pied by scholastic theology and physiology, and it will 142 ] [142:1eradicate sickness and sin in less time than the old systems, ] [devised for subduing them, have required for self-estab] [3lishment and propagation. ] [ Anciently the followers of Christ, or Truth, measured ] [Christianity by its power over sickness, sin, and death; ] [6Two claims omittedbut modern religions generally omit all but one ] [of these powers, \u2014 the power over sin. We ] [must seek the undivided garment, the whole Christ, as our ] [9first proof of Christianity, for Christ, Truth, alone can ] [furnish us with absolute evidence. ] [ If the soft palm, upturned to a lordly salary, and archi] [12tectural skill, making dome and spire tremulous with ] [Selfishness and lossbeauty, turn the poor and the stranger from the ] [gate, they at the same time shut the door on ] [15progress. In vain do the manger and the cross tell their ] [story to pride and fustian. Sensuality palsies the right ] [hand, and causes the left to let go its grasp on the divine. ] [18 As in Jesus' time, so to-day, tyranny and pride need to ] [be whipped out of the temple, and humility and divine Sci] [Temple cleansedence to be welcomed in. The strong cords of ] [21scientific demonstration, as twisted and wielded ] [by Jesus, are still needed to purge the temples of their ] [vain traffic in worldly worship and to make them meet ] [24dwelling-places for the Most High. ] [ Which was first, Mind or medicine? If Mind was ] [27first and self-existent, then Mind, not matter, must have ] [Question of precedencebeen the first medicine. God being All-in-] [all, He made medicine; but that medicine was ] [30Mind. It could not have been matter, which departs ] [from the nature and character of Mind, God. Truth 143 ] [143:1 is God's remedy for error of every kind, and Truth de] [stroys only what is untrue. Hence the fact that, to-day, ] [3as yesterday, Christ casts out evils and heals the ] [sick. ] [ It is plain that God does not employ drugs or hygiene, ] [6nor provide them for human use; else Jesus would have ] [Methods rejectedrecommended and employed them in his heal] [ing. The sick are more deplorably lost than ] [9the sinning, if the sick cannot rely on God for help and ] [the sinning can. The divine Mind never called matter ] [medicine, and matter required a material and human be] [12lief before it could be considered as medicine. ] [ Sometimes the human mind uses one error to medi] [cine another. Driven to choose between two difficulties, ] [15Error not curativethe human mind takes the lesser to relieve the ] [greater. On this basis it saves from starva] [tion by theft, and quiets pain with anodynes. You ] [18admit that mind influences the body somewhat, but ] [you conclude that the stomach, blood, nerves, bones, ] [etc., hold the preponderance of power. Controlled by ] [21this belief, you continue in the old routine. You lean on ] [the inert and unintelligent, never discerning how this de] [prives you of the available superiority of divine Mind. ] [24The body is not controlled scientifically by a negative ] [mind. ] [ Mind is the grand creator, and there can be no power ] [27except that which is derived from Mind. If Mind was ] [Impossible coalescencefirst chronologically, is first potentially, and ] [must be first eternally, then give to Mind the ] [30glory, honor, dominion, and power everlastingly due its ] [holy name. Inferior and unspiritual methods of healing ] [may try to make Mind and drugs coalesce, but the two will 144 ] [144:1not mingle scientifically. Why should we wish to make ] [them do so, since no good can come of it? ] [3 If Mind is foremost and superior, let us rely upon Mind, ] [which needs no cooperation from lower powers, even if ] [these so-called powers are real. ] [ 6Naught is the squire, when the king is nigh; ] [Withdraws the star, when dawns the sun's brave light. ] [ The various mortal beliefs formulated in human philoso] [9phy, physiology, hygiene, are mainly predicated of matter, ] [Soul and senseand afford faint gleams of God, or Truth. ] [The more material a belief, the more obstinately ] [12tenacious its error; the stronger are the manifestations of ] [the corporeal senses, the weaker the indications of Soul. ] [ Human will-power is not Science. Human will belongs ] [15to the so-called material senses, and its use is to be con] [Will-power detrimentaldemned. Willing the sick to recover is not the ] [metaphysical practice of Christian Science, but ] [18is sheer animal magnetism. Human will-power may in] [fringe the rights of man. It produces evil continually, ] [and is not a factor in the realism of being. Truth, and ] [21not corporeal will, is the divine power which says to ] [disease, \"Peace, be still.\" ] [ Because divine Science wars with so-called physical ] [24science, even as Truth wars with error, the old schools ] [Conservative antagonismstill oppose it. Ignorance, pride, or prejudice ] [closes the door to whatever is not stereotyped. ] [27When the Science of being is universally understood, ] [every man will be his own physician, and Truth will be ] [the universal panacea. ] [30 It is a question to-day, whether the ancient inspired ] [healers understood the Science of Christian healing, or 145 ] [145:1whether they caught its sweet tones, as the natural ] [musician catches the tones of harmony, without being ] [3Ancient healersable to explain them. So divinely imbued ] [were they with the spirit of Science, that the ] [lack of the letter could not hinder their work; and that ] [6letter, without the spirit, would have made void their ] [practice. ] [ The struggle for the recovery of invalids goes on, not ] [9between material methods, but between mortal minds ] [The struggle and victoryand immortal Mind. The victory will be on ] [the patient's side only as immortal Mind ] [12 through Christ, Truth, subdues the human belief in ] [disease. It matters not what material method one may ] [adopt, whether faith in drugs, trust in hygiene, or reliance ] [15on some other minor curative. ] [ Scientific healing has this advantage over other meth] [ods, \u2014 that in it Truth controls error. From this fact ] [18Mystery of godlinessarise its ethical as well as its physical ef] [fects. Indeed, its ethical and physical effects ] [are indissolubly connected. If there is any mystery ] [21in Christian healing, it is the mystery which godliness ] [always presents to the ungodly, \u2014 the mystery always ] [arising from ignorance of the laws of eternal and unerr] [24ing Mind. ] [ Other methods undertake to oppose error with error, ] [and thus they increase the antagonism of one form of ] [27Matter versus mattermatter towards other forms of matter or error, ] [and the warfare between Spirit and the flesh ] [goes on. By this antagonism mortal mind must con] [30tinually weaken its own assumed power. ] [ The theology of Christian Science includes healing ] [the sick. Our Master's first article of faith propounded 146 ] [146:1to his students was healing, and he proved his faith by ] [his works. The ancient Christians were healers. Why ] [3How healing was losthas this element of Christianity been lost? ] [Because our systems of religion are governed ] [more or less by our systems of medicine. The first idol] [6atry was faith in matter. The schools have rendered ] [faith in drugs the fashion, rather than faith in Deity. By ] [trusting matter to destroy its own discord, health and ] [9harmony have been sacrificed. Such systems are barren ] [of the vitality of spiritual power, by which material sense ] [is made the servant of Science and religion becomes ] [12Christlike. ] [ Material medicine substitutes drugs for the power of ] [God \u2014 even the might of Mind \u2014 to heal the body. ] [15Drugs and divinityScholasticism clings for salvation to the per] [son, instead of to the divine Principle, of the ] [man Jesus; and his Science, the curative agent of God, ] [18is silenced. Why? Because truth divests material drugs ] [of their imaginary power, and clothes Spirit with suprem] [acy. Science is the \"stranger that is within thy gates,\" ] [21remembered not, even when its elevating effects prac] [tically prove its divine origin and efficacy. ] [ Divine Science derives its sanction from the Bible, ] [24and the divine origin of Science is demonstrated through ] [Christian Science as old as Godthe holy influence of Truth in healing sick] [ness and sin. This healing power of Truth ] [27 must have been far anterior to the period in ] [which Jesus lived. It is as ancient as \"the Ancient of ] [days.\" It lives through all Life, and extends throughout ] [30all space. ] [ Divine metaphysics is now reduced to a system, to a ] [form comprehensible by and adapted to the thought of 147 ] [147:1the age in which we live. This system enables the ] [Reduction to systemlearner to demonstrate the divine Principle, ] [3upon which Jesus' healing was based, and ] [the sacred rules for its present application to the cure of ] [disease. ] [6 Late in the nineteenth century I demonstrated the divine ] [rules of Christian Science. They were submitted to the ] [broadest practical test, and everywhere, when honestly ap] [9plied under circumstances where demonstration was hu] [manly possible, this Science showed that Truth had lost ] [none of its divine and healing efficacy, even though cen] [12turies had passed away since Jesus practised these rules ] [on the hills of Jud\u00e6a and in the valleys of Galilee. ] [ Although this volume contains the complete Science of ] [15Mind-healing, never believe that you can absorb the whole ] [Perusal and practicemeaning of the Science by a simple perusal ] [ of this book. The book needs to be studied, ] [18 and the demonstration of the rules of scientific healing ] [will plant you firmly on the spiritual groundwork of ] [Christian Science. This proof lifts you high above the ] [21perishing fossils of theories already antiquated, and en] [ables you to grasp the spiritual facts of being hitherto ] [unattained and seemingly dim. ] [24 Our Master healed the sick, practised Christian heal] [ing, and taught the generalities of its divine Principle to ] [A definite rule discoveredhis students; but he left no definite rule for ] [27demonstrating this Principle of healing and ] [preventing disease. This rule remained to be discovered ] [in Christian Science. A pure affection takes form in good] [30ness, but Science alone reveals the divine Principle of ] [goodness and demonstrates its rules. ] [ Jesus never spoke of disease as dangerous or as difficult 148 ] [148:1to heal. When his students brought to him a case they ] [had failed to heal, he said to them, \"O faithless gen] [3Jesus' own practiceeration,\" implying that the requisite power ] [to heal was in Mind. He prescribed no drugs, ] [urged no obedience to material laws, but acted in direct ] [6disobedience to them. ] [ Neither anatomy nor theology has ever described man ] [as created by Spirit, \u2014 as God's man. The former ex] [9The man of anatomy and of theologyplains the men of men, or the \"children of ] [men,\" as created corporeally instead of spir] [itually and as emerging from the lowest, in] [12stead of from the highest, conception of being. Both ] [anatomy and theology define man as both physical and ] [mental, and place mind at the mercy of matter for every ] [15function, formation, and manifestation. Anatomy takes ] [up man at all points materially. It loses Spirit, drops the ] [true tone, and accepts the discord. Anatomy and the] [18ology reject the divine Principle which produces harmo] [nious man, and deal \u2014 the one wholly, the other primarily ] [\u2014 with matter, calling that man which is not the counter] [21part, but the counterfeit, of God's man. Then theology ] [tries to explain how to make this man a Christian, \u2014 how ] [from this basis of division and discord to produce the con] [24cord and unity of Spirit and His likeness. ] [ Physiology exalts matter, dethrones Mind, and claims ] [to rule man by material law, instead of spiritual. When ] [27Physiology deficientphysiology fails to give health or life by this ] [process, it ignores the divine Spirit as unable ] [or unwilling to render help in time of physical need. ] [30When mortals sin, this ruling of the schools leaves them ] [to the guidance of a theology which admits God to be ] [the healer of sin but not of sickness, although our great 149 ] [149:1Master demonstrated that Truth could save from sickness ] [as well as from sin. ] [3 Mind as far outweighs drugs in the cure of disease as ] [in the cure of sin. The more excellent way is divine ] [Blunders and blunderersScience in every case. Is materia medica a ] [6science or a bundle of speculative human ] [theories? The prescription which succeeds in one in] [stance fails in another, and this is owing to the different ] [9mental states of the patient. These states are not com] [prehended, and they are left without explanation except ] [in Christian Science. The rule and its perfection of opera] [12tion never vary in Science. If you fail to succeed in any ] [case, it is because you have not demonstrated the life of ] [Christ, Truth, more in your own life, \u2014 because you have ] [15not obeyed the rule and proved the Principle of divine ] [Science. ] [ A physician of the old school remarked with great ] [18gravity: \"We know that mind affects the body some] [Old-school physicianwhat, and advise our patients to be hopeful ] [and cheerful and to take as little medicine as ] [21possible; but mind can never cure organic difficulties.\" ] [The logic is lame, and facts contradict it. The author ] [has cured what is termed organic disease as readily as she ] [24has cured purely functional disease, and with no power ] [but the divine Mind. ] [ Since God, divine Mind, governs all, not partially but ] [27supremely, predicting disease does not dignify therapeutics. ] [Tests in our dayWhatever guides thought spiritually benefits ] [mind and body. We need to understand the ] [30affirmations of divine Science, dismiss superstition, and ] [demonstrate truth according to Christ. To-day there ] [is hardly a city, village, or hamlet, in which are not to 150 ] [150:1be found living witnesses and monuments to the virtue ] [and power of Truth, as applied through this Christian ] [3system of healing disease. ] [ To-day the healing power of Truth is widely demon] [strated as an immanent, eternal Science, instead of a ] [6The main purposephenomenal exhibition. Its appearing is the ] [coming anew of the gospel of \"on earth peace, ] [good-will toward men.\" This coming, as was promised ] [9by the Master, is for its establishment as a permanent ] [dispensation among men; but the mission of Christian ] [Science now, as in the time of its earlier demonstration, ] [12is not primarily one of physical healing. Now, as then, ] [signs and wonders are wrought in the metaphysical heal] [ing of physical disease; but these signs are only to demon] [15strate its divine origin, \u2014 to attest the reality of the higher ] [mission of the Christ-power to take away the sins of the ] [world. ] [18 The science (so-called) of physics would have one be] [lieve that both matter and mind are subject to disease, ] [Exploded doctrineand that, too, in spite of the individual's pro] [21test and contrary to the law of divine Mind. ] [This human view infringes man's free moral agency; and ] [it is as evidently erroneous to the author, and will be to ] [24all others at some future day, as the practically rejected ] [doctrine of the predestination of souls to damnation or ] [salvation. The doctrine that man's harmony is gov] [27erned by physical conditions all his earthly days, and that ] [he is then thrust out of his own body by the operation of ] [matter, \u2014 even the doctrine of the superiority of matter ] [30over Mind, \u2014 is fading out. ] [ The hosts of \u00c6sculapius are flooding the world with ] [diseases, because they are ignorant that the human mind 151 ] [151:1and body are myths. To be sure, they sometimes treat ] [the sick as if there was but one factor in the case; but ] [3Disease mentalthis one factor they represent to be body, not ] [mind. Infinite Mind could not possibly create ] [a remedy outside of itself, but erring, finite, human mind ] [6has an absolute need of something beyond itself for its ] [redemption and healing. ] [ Great respect is due the motives and philanthropy of ] [9the higher class of physicians. We know that if they un] [Intentions respectedderstood the Science of Mind-healing, and were ] [in possession of the enlarged power it confers ] [12to benefit the race physically and spiritually, they would ] [rejoice with us. Even this one reform in medicine would ] [ultimately deliver mankind from the awful and oppres] [15sive bondage now enforced by false theories, from which ] [multitudes would gladly escape. ] [ Mortal belief says that death has been occasioned by ] [18fright. Fear never stopped being and its action. The ] [Man governed by Mindblood, heart, lungs, brain, etc., have nothing ] [to do with Life, God. Every function of the ] [21real man is governed by the divine Mind. The human ] [mind has no power to kill or to cure, and it has no con] [trol over God's man. The divine Mind that made man ] [24maintains His own image and likeness. The human ] [mind is opposed to God and must be put off, as St. Paul ] [declares. All that really exists is the divine Mind and ] [27its idea, and in this Mind the entire being is found har] [monious and eternal. The straight and narrow way is to ] [see and acknowledge this fact, yield to this power, and ] [30follow the leadings of truth. ] [ That mortal mind claims to govern every organ of the ] [mortal body, we have overwhelming proof. But this so-152] [152:1called mind is a myth, and must by its own consent yield ] [to Truth. It would wield the sceptre of a monarch, but ] [3Mortal mind dethronedit is powerless. The immortal divine Mind ] [ takes away all its supposed sovereignty, and ] [saves mortal mind from itself. The author has endeavored ] [6to make this book the \u00c6sculapius of mind as well as of ] [body, that it may give hope to the sick and heal them, ] [although they know not how the work is done. Truth ] [9 has a healing effect, even when not fully understood. ] [ Anatomy describes muscular action as produced by ] [mind in one instance and not in another. Such errors ] [12All activity from thoughtbeset every material theory, in which one ] [statement contradicts another over and over ] [again. It is related that Sir Humphry Davy once ap] [15parently cured a case of paralysis simply by introducing ] [a thermometer into the patient's mouth. This he did ] [merely to ascertain the temperature of the patient's body; ] [18but the sick man supposed this ceremony was intended ] [to heal him, and he recovered accordingly. Such a fact ] [illustrates our theories. ] [21 The author's medical researches and experiments had ] [prepared her thought for the metaphysics of Christian ] [The author's experiments in medicineScience. Every material dependence had ] [24failed her in her search for truth; and she can ] [now understand why, and can see the means ] [by which mortals are divinely driven to a spiritual source ] [27for health and happiness. ] [ Her experiments in homopathy had made her skep] [tical as to material curative Jahr, attenuationsAconitum to Zincum oxydatum, enumerates ] [the general symptoms, the characteristic ] [signs, which demand different remedies; but the drug 153 ] [153:1is frequently attenuated to such a degree that not a ves] [tige of it remains. Thus we learn that it is not the drug ] [3which expels the disease or changes one of the symptoms ] [of disease. ] [ The author has attenuated Natrum muriaticum (com] [6mon table-salt) until there was single saline property ] [Only salt and waterleft. The salt had \"lost his savour;\" and yet, ] [with one drop of that attenuation in a goblet of ] [9water, and a teaspoonful of the water administered at in] [tervals of three hours, she has cured a patient sinking in ] [the last stage of typhoid fever. The highest attenuation ] [12of homopathy and the most potent rises above matter into ] [mind. This discovery leads to more light. From it may ] [be learned that either human faith or the divine Mind is ] [15the healer and that there is no efficacy in a drug. ] [ You say a boil is painful; but that is impossible, for ] [matter without mind is not painful. The boil simply ] [18Origin of painmanifests, through inflammation and swell] [ing, a belief in pain, and this belief is called a ] [boil. Now administer mentally to your patient a high ] [21attenuation of truth, and it will soon cure the boil. The ] [fact that pain cannot exist where there is no mortal mind ] [to feel it is a proof that this so-called mind makes its ] [24own pain \u2014 that is, its own belief in pain. ] [ We weep because others weep, we yawn because they ] [yawn, and we have smallpox because others have it; but ] [27Source of contagionmortal mind, not matter, contains and carries ] [the infection. When this mental contagion is ] [understood, we shall be more careful of our mental con] [30ditions, and we shall avoid loquacious tattling about ] [disease, as we would avoid advocating crime. Neither ] [sympathy nor society should ever tempt us to cherish 154 ] [154:1error in any form, and certainly we should not be error's ] [advocate. ] [3 Disease arises, like other mental conditions, from as] [sociation. Since it is a law of mortal mind that certain ] [diseases should be regarded as contagious, this law ob] [6tains credit through association, \u2014 calling up the fear that ] [creates the image of disease and its consequent manifes] [tation in the body. ] [9 This fact in metaphysics is illustrated by the following ] [incident: A man was made to believe that he occupied a ] [Imaginary cholerabed where a cholera patient had died. Imme] [12diately the symptoms of this disease appeared, ] [and the man died. The fact was, that he had not caught ] [the cholera by material contact, because no cholera patient ] [15had been in that bed. ] [ If a child is exposed to contagion or infection, the ] [mother is frightened and says, \"My child will be sick.\" ] [18Children's ailmentsThe law of mortal mind and her own fears gov] [ern her child more than the child's mind gov] [erns itself, and they produce the very results which might ] [21have been prevented through the opposite understanding. ] [Then it is believed that exposure to the contagion wrought ] [the mischief. ] [24 That mother is not a Christian Scientist, and her affec] [tions need better guidance, who says to [27need medicine.\" ] [ Such a mother runs to her little one, who thinks she has ] [hurt her face by falling on the carpet, and says, moaning ] [30more childishly than her child, \"Mamma knows you are ] [hurt.\" The better and more successful method for any ] [mother to adopt is to say: \"Oh, never mind! You're not 155 ] [155:1hurt, so don't think you are.\" Presently the child forgets ] [all about the accident, and is at play. ] [3 When the sick recover by the use of drugs, it is the law ] [of a general belief, culminating in individual faith, which ] [Drug-power mentalheals; and according to this faith will the effect ] [6be. Even when you take away the individual ] [confidence in the drug, you have not yet divorced the drug ] [from the general faith. The chemist, the botanist, the ] [9druggist, the doctor, and the nurse equip the medicine ] [with their faith, and the beliefs which are in the majority ] [rule. When the general belief endorses the inanimate ] [12drug as doing this or that, individual dissent or faith, un] [less it rests on Science, is but a belief held by a minority, ] [and such a belief is governed by the majority. ] [15 The universal belief in physics weighs against the high ] [and mighty truths of Christian metaphysics. This errone] [Belief in physicsous general belief, which sustains medicine and ] [18produces all medical results, works against ] [Christian Science; and the percentage of power on the ] [side of this Science must mightily outweigh the power of ] [21popular belief in order to heal a single case of disease. The ] [human mind acts more powerfully to offset the discords ] [of matter and the ills of flesh, in proportion as it puts less ] [24weight into the material or fleshly scale and more weight ] [into the spiritual scale. Homopathy diminishes the ] [drug, but the potency of the medicine increases as the ] [27drug disappears. ] [ Vegetarianism, homopathy, and hydropathy have ] [diminished drugging; but if drugs are an antidote to ] [30Nature of drugsdisease, why lessen the antidote? If drugs ] [are good things, is it safe to say that the ] [less in quantity you have of them the better? If drugs 156 ] [156:1possess intrinsic virtues or intelligent curative qualities, ] [these qualities must be mental. Who named drugs, and ] [3what made them good or bad for mortals, beneficial or ] [injurious? ] [ A case of dropsy, given up by the faculty, fell into ] [6my hands. It was a terrible case. Tapping had been ] [Dropsy cured without drugsemployed, and yet, as she lay in her bed, the ] [patient looked like a barrel. I prescribed ] [9the fourth attenuation of Argentum nitratum with occa] Sulphuris. She im] [proved perceptibly. Believing then somewhat in the ] [12ordinary theories of medical practice, and learning that ] [her former physician had prescribed these remedies, I ] [ began to fear an aggravation of symptoms from their ] [15prolonged use, and told the patient so; but she was ] [unwilling to give up the medicine while she was re] [covering. It then occurred to me to give her un] [18medicated pellets and watch the result. I did so, and ] [she continued to gain. Finally she said that she would ] [give up her medicine for one day, and risk the ] [21effects. After trying this, she informed me that she ] [could get along two days without globules; but on ] [the third day she again suffered, and was relieved by ] [24taking them. She went on in this way, taking the ] [unmedicated pellets, \u2014 and receiving occasional visits ] [from me, \u2014 but employing no other means, and she was ] [27cured. ] [ Metaphysics, as taught in Christian Science, is the ] [next stately step beyond homopathy. In metaphysics, ] [30A stately advancematter disappears from the remedy entirely, ] [and Mind takes its rightful and supreme ] [place. Homopathy takes mental symptoms largely 157 ] [157:1into consideration in its diagnosis of disease. Christian ] [Science deals wholly with the mental cause in judging and ] [3destroying disease. It succeeds where homopathy fails, ] [solely because its one recognized Principle of healing is ] [Mind, and the whole force of the mental element is em] [6ployed through the Science of Mind, which never shares ] [its rights with inanimate matter. ] [ Christian Science exterminates the drug, and rests on ] [9Mind alone as the curative Principle, acknowledging that ] [The modus of homopathythe divine Mind has all power. Homopathy ] [mentalizes a drug with such repetition of ] [12thought-attenuations, that the drug becomes ] [more like the human mind than the substratum of this so-] [called mind, which we call matter; and the drug's power ] [15of action is proportionately increased. ] [ If drugs are part of God's creation, which (according ] [to the narrative in Genesis) He pronounced good, then ] [18Drugging unchristiandrugs cannot be poisonous. If He could cre] [ate drugs intrinsically bad, then they should ] [never be used. If He creates drugs at all and designs ] [21them for medical use, why did Jesus not employ them ] [and recommend them for the treatment of disease? ] [Matter is not self-creative, for it is unintelligent. Erring ] [24mortal mind confers the power which the drug seems to ] [possess. ] [ Narcotics quiet mortal mind, and so relieve the body; ] [27but they leave both mind and body worse for this sub] [mission. Christian Science impresses the entire corpore] [ality, \u2014 namely, mind and body, \u2014 and brings out the ] [30proof that Life is continuous and harmonious. Science ] [ both neutralizes error and destroys it. Mankind is the ] [better for this spiritual and profound pathology. ] [158:1 It is recorded that the profession of medicine originated ] [in idolatry with pagan priests, who besought the gods to ] [3Mythology and materia medicaheal the sick and designated Apollo as \"the god ] [of medicine.\" He was supposed to have dic] [tated the first prescription, according to the ] [6\"History of Four Thousand Years of Medicine.\" It is ] [here noticeable that Apollo was also regarded as the sender ] [of disease, \"the god of pestilence.\" Hippocrates turned ] [9from image-gods to vegetable and mineral drugs for heal] [ing. This was deemed progress in medicine; but ] [what we need is the truth which heals both mind and ] [12body. The future history of material medicine may ] [correspond with that of its material god, Apollo, who was ] [banished from heaven and endured great sufferings ] [15upon earth. ] [ Drugs, cataplasms, and whiskey are stupid substitutes ] [for the dignity and potency of divine Mind and its effi] [18Footsteps to intemperancecacy to heal. It is pitiful to lead men into ] [temptation through the byways of this wil] [derness world, \u2014 to victimize the race with intoxicating ] [21prescriptions for the sick, until mortal mind acquires an ] [educated appetite for strong drink, and men and women ] [become loathsome sots. ] [24 Evidences of progress and of spiritualization greet us ] [on every hand. Drug-systems are quitting their hold on ] [Advancing degreesmatter and so letting in matter's higher stra] [27tum, mortal mind. Homopathy, a step in ] [advance of allopathy, is doing this. Matter is going out ] [of medicine; and mortal mind, of a higher attenuation ] [30than the drug, is governing the pellet. ] [ A woman in the city of Lynn, Massachusetts, was ] [etherized and died in consequence, although her physi159] [159:1cians insisted that it would be unsafe to perform a needed ] [surgical operation without the ether. After the autopsy, ] [3Effects of fearher sister testified that the deceased protested ] [against inhaling the ether and said it would kill ] [her, but that she was compelled by her physicians to take ] [6it. Her hands were held, and she was forced into sub] [mission. The case was brought to trial. The evidence ] [was found to be conclusive, and a verdict was returned that ] [9death was occasioned, not by the ether, but by fear of ] [inhaling it. ] [ Is it skilful or scientific surgery to take no heed of men] [12tal conditions and to treat the patient as if she were so ] [Mental conditions to be heededmuch mindless matter, and as if matter were ] [the only factor to be consulted? Had these ] [15unscientific surgeons understood metaphysics, ] [they would have considered the woman's state of mind, ] [and not have risked such treatment. They would either ] [18have allayed her fear or would have performed the opera] [tion without ether. ] [ The sequel proved that this Lynn woman died from ] [21effects produced by mortal mind, and not from the disease ] [or the operation. ] [ The medical schools would learn the state of man ] [24from matter instead of from Mind. They examine the ] [False source of knowledgelungs, tongue, and pulse to ascertain how ] [much harmony, or health, matter is permit] [27ting to matter, \u2014 how much pain or pleasure, action or ] [stagnation, one form of matter is allowing another form ] [of matter. ] [30 Ignorant of the fact that a man's belief produces dis] [ease and all its symptoms, the ordinary physician is ] [liable to increase disease with his own mind, when he 160 ] [160:1should address himself to the work of destroying it through ] [the power of the divine Mind. ] [3 The systems of physics act against metaphysics, and ] [vice versa. When mortals forsake the material for the ] [spiritual basis of action, drugs lose their healing force, ] [6for they have no innate power. Unsupported by the ] [faith reposed in it, the inanimate drug becomes ] [powerless. ] [9 The motion of the arm is no more dependent upon the ] [direction of mortal mind, than are the organic action and ] [Obedient musclessecretion of the viscera. When this so-called ] [12mind quits the body, the heart becomes as tor] [pid as the hand. ] [ Anatomy finds a necessity for nerves to convey the man] [15date of mind to muscle and so cause action; but what does ] [Anatomy and mindanatomy say when the cords contract and be] [come immovable? Has mortal mind ceased ] [18speaking to them, or has it bidden them to be impotent? ] [Can muscles, bones, blood, and nerves rebel against mind ] [in one instance and not in another, and become cramped ] [21despite the mental protest? ] [ Unless muscles are self-acting at all times, they are ] [never so, \u2014 never capable of acting contrary to mental ] [24direction. If muscles can cease to act and become rigid ] [of their own preference, \u2014 be deformed or symmetrical, ] [as they please or as disease directs, \u2014 they must be self-] [27directing. Why then consult anatomy to learn how mor] [tal mind governs muscle, if we are only to learn from ] [anatomy that muscle is not so governed? ] [30Mind over matter Is man a material fungus without Mind ] [ to help him? Is a stiff joint or a contracted ] [muscle as much a result of law as the supple and 161 ] [161:1elastic condition of the healthy limb, and is God the ] [lawgiver? ] [3 You say, \"I have burned my finger.\" This is an ] [exact statement, more exact than you suppose; for mor] [tal mind, and not matter, burns it. Holy inspiration ] [6has created states of mind which have been able to nullify ] [the action of the flames, as in the Bible case of the three ] [young Hebrew captives, cast into the Babylonian furnace; ] [9while an opposite mental state might produce spontaneous ] [combustion. ] [ In 1880, Massachusetts put her foot on a proposed ] [12tyrannical law, restricting the practice of medicine. If ] [Restrictive regulationsher sister States follow this example in har] [mony with our Constitution and Bill of Rights, ] [15they will do less violence to that immortal sentiment of the ] [Declaration, \"Man is endowed by his Maker with certain ] [inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the ] [18pursuit of happiness.\" ] [ The oppressive state statutes touching medicine re] [mind one of the words of the famous Madame Roland, ] [21as she knelt before a statue of Liberty, erected near the ] [guillotine: \"Liberty, what crimes are committed in thy ] [name!\" ] [24 The ordinary practitioner, examining bodily symptoms, ] [telling the patient that he is sick, and treating the case ac] [Metaphysics challenges physicscording to his physical diagnosis, would natu] [27rally induce the very disease he is trying to cure, ] [even if it were not already determined by mor] [tal mind. Such unconscious mistakes would not occur, if ] [30this old class of philanthropists looked as deeply for cause ] [and effect into mind as into matter. The physician agrees ] [with his \"adversary quickly,\" but upon different terms 162 ] [162:1than does the metaphysician; for the matter-physician ] [agrees with the disease, while the metaphysician agrees ] [3only with health and challenges disease. ] [ Christian Science brings to the body the sunlight of ] [Truth, which invigorates and purifies. Christian Science ] [6Truth an alterativeacts as an alterative, neutralizing error It changes the secretions, expels hu] [mors, dissolves tumors, relaxes rigid muscles, restores ] [9carious bones to soundness. The effect of this Science is ] [to stir the human mind to a change of base, on which it ] [may yield to the harmony of the divine Mind. ] [12 Experiments have favored the fact that Mind governs ] [the body, not in one instance, but in every instance. The ] [Practical successindestructible faculties of Spirit exist without ] [15the conditions of matter and also without the ] [false beliefs of a so-called material existence. Working ] [out the rules of Science in practice, the author has re] [18stored health in cases of both acute and chronic disease in ] [their severest forms. Secretions have been changed, the ] [structure has been renewed, shortened limbs have been ] [21elongated, ankylosed joints have been made supple, and ] [carious bones have been restored to healthy conditions. I ] [ have restored what is called the lost substance of lungs, and ] [24healthy organizations have been established where disease ] [was organic. Christian Science heals organic disease as ] [surely as it heals what is called functional, for it requires ] [27only a fuller understanding of the divine Principle of ] [Christian Science to demonstrate the higher rule. ] [Testimony of medical teachers With due respect for the faculty, I kindly ] [30quote from Dr. Benjamin Rush, the famous ] [Philadelphia teacher of medical practice. He ] [declared that \"it is impossible to calculate the mischief 163 ] [163:1which Hippocrates has done, by first marking Nature ] [with his name, and afterward letting her loose upon sick ] [3people.\" ] [ Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse, Professor in Harvard Uni] [versity, declared himself \"sick of learned quackery.\" ] [6 Dr. James Johnson, Surgeon to William IV, King of ] [England, said: ] [ \"I declare my conscientious opinion, founded on long ] [9observation and reflection, that if there were not a single ] [physician, surgeon, apothecary, man-midwife, chemist, ] [druggist, or drug on the face of the earth, there would be ] [12less sickness and less mortality.\" ] [ Dr. Mason Good, a learned Professor in London, ] [said: ] [15 \"The effects of medicine on the human system are in ] [the highest degree uncertain; except, indeed, that it has ] [already destroyed more lives than war, pestilence, and ] [18famine, all combined.\" ] [ Dr. Chapman, Professor of the Institutes and Practice ] [of Physic in the University of Pennsylvania, in a published ] [21essay said: ] [ \"Consulting the records of our science, we cannot ] [help being disgusted with the multitude of hypotheses ] [24obtruded upon us at different times. Nowhere is the ] [imagination displayed to a greater extent; and perhaps ] [so ample an exhibition of human invention might gratify ] [27our vanity, if it were not more than compensated by the ] [humiliating view of so much absurdity, contradiction, ] [and falsehood. To harmonize the contrarieties of med] [30ical doctrines is indeed a task as impracticable as to ] [arrange the fleeting vapors around us, or to reconcile the ] [fixed and repulsive antipathies of nature.

Much ] [yet remains to be said and done before all mankind is ] [15saved and all the mental microbes of sin and all diseased ] [thought-germs are exterminated. ] [ If you or I should appear to die, we should not be ] [18dead. The seeming decease, caused by a majority of ] [human beliefs that man must die, or produced by mental ] [assassins, does not in the least disprove Christian Science; ] [21rather does it evidence the truth of its basic proposition ] [that mortal thoughts in belief rule the materiality mis] [called life in the body or in matter. But the forever fact ] [24remains paramount that Life, Truth, and Love save from ] [sin, disease, and death. \"When this corruptible shall have ] [put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on ] [27immortality [divine Science], then shall be brought to pass ] [the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in ] [victory\" (St. Paul). ] "}
