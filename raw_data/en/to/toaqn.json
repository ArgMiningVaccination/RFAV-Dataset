Moreover, diabetes is a rising concern as it leads to diseases What is the projected demand for workers in the health care field over the next 20 years? The number one killer in the United States today is heart disease or also known as cardiovascular disease (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2015). As death rates begin to rise due to cardiovascular disease, in 1948 the Framingham Heart Study became a joint project of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and Boston University to pinpoint the most common factors that play a role in cardiovascular disease and strokes (Framingham Heart Study, 2015). Over several years, the Framingham study has identified several risks factors that are believed to increase the likelihood of a person being diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. These risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and physical While screening tests are tremendously vital and have proved life-saving on countless occasions to ensure that individuals do not unknowingly have a certain disease, they are not always necessary. For example, this is seen in the screening test for Prostate cancer, called the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) blood test. As of today, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) does not universally recommend that men get screened for Prostate cancer. The USPSTF is an important and relevant organization to follow for screening guidelines because it works to improve the health of all Americans through striving to make accurate, up-to-date, and relevant recommendations about preventative services in primary care. Splenic artery aneurysm is the third most common aneurysm in the abdomen and the most common type to affect the internal organs. The spleen is an abdominal organ that forms part of the immune system. It has a large artery that supplies blood to it. When a portion of this artery balloons or widens because of weakness in its walls, an aneurysm develops. Other more common intra-abdominal aneurysms affect the aorta and the iliac arteries. In 2010, the uninsured rate for adults aged 18-34 years was approximately double the uninsured rate for adults aged 45-64 years. In Grey's Anatomy, Denny Duquette Jr. is a middle-aged man who abandoned his family and friends in preparation of for his death. His ailment? Heart disease. Denny finds himself at Seattle Grace Hospital where he meets one of the doctors, Isobel Stevens, and falls in love with her. After many failing treatments, Denny eventually gets a heart transplant and proposes to Isobel, but he dies that same night. Even Denny's new heart could not support his love and he died leaving Isobel similarly to the way he abandoned his family. As people age, health becomes more of a concern as people more prone to health problems. Four major blood vessel supply blood to the brain. They join together at the circle of willis at the base of the brain. Smaller arteries leave the circle and branch out to supply brain cells with oxygen and nutrients.Artery junction points may become weak causing a ballooning of the blood vessel wall to potentially form a small sac or aneurysm.Cerebral aneurysms are common but most are asymptomatic and are found incidentally at autopsy. A 75 year old female patient alert and oriented X 3, weigh 115 Lbs, her height 5?8??, has a hearing aid and wear glasses for reading. The presented Patient has a history of hypertension diagnosed with CHF on 2013, positive for Hepatitis B due to contaminated blood transfusion. Had a cervical dysplasia on 1994 resolved by a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy the following year. The patient was diagnosed for polyps and multiple diverticula at the age of 68. The Patient suffers of painful osteoarthritis of both knees, shoulder hips. Patient?s mother deceased at the age of 79 from breast cancer and her father deceased at the age of 54 from heart attack. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) encompass diverse types of tumors arising from neuroendocrine (enterochromaffin) cells found throughout the body. While NETs often have a relatively indolent course, there is a propensity for metastasis to the liver producing the classic carcinoid syndrome of diarrhea and flushing. Metastasis to other sites such as the peritoneum and mesentery is also common {Woodside 2004; Akerstrom 2005} however primary mesenteric NET is rare. We present a 64 year-old man with mesenteric NET without any other primary site. Prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer in Australia as reported by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (2015). Despite the high survival rates in Australia (93%), it is estimated that the number of male deaths from prostate cancer will increase in 2015 (AIHW 2015). This disease has been recognized for high rates of mortality in elderly men of particular ethnicities. This report aims to adopt a Marxist perspective to analyse the issue of prostate cancer, in proposing that The goal of this essay is to persuade people to become educated about their health, and to take action to lead a healthier lifestyle. In order to be successful, this essay need to convince the reader that taking a health screening is a safe and effective way to learn about their health, and to save I chose to use the Health Belief Model, borrowed from the behavioral sciences, which explain the health behavior of the individuals. According to Rosenstock (1988), Health Belief Model contains six constructs: 1) perceived susceptibility, 2) perceived severity, 3) perceived benefits, 4) perceived barriers, 5) cues to action, and 6) self-efficacy. During the care of the obstetric (OB) patient throughout labor, delivery, and postpartum, obstetric departments work to provide safe outcomes for mothers and infants. To do so, nurses must be prepared to act upon any adverse event associated with increased maternal or neonatal morbidity or mortality. However, staff are challenged to implement evidence-based practice when these events occur so infrequently. This is especially challenging for nurses who are new to obstetric care and have little, if any, exposure to adverse scenarios or events. For these reasons, newly hired nurses who have less than 1-2 years' experience in obstetrics nursing could benefit from a high-risk OB class that incorporates topics including postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) to assist in earlier recognition, response, and ultimately improved patient care.
