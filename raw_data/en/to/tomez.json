It's a pleasure to welcome you to my website [Mindbody Therapies](https://mindbody-therapies.com/get-started/how-a-mindbody-therapy-session-works/) that focuses on holistic health & well-being as well as the important process of transforming past traumas into strength and inner freedom. The healing practice I offer is based on ancient knowledge from the Himalayas, \"Rang Dr\u00f6l\" and \"Thoba Khujatag\", which you could say is the the Tibetan version of Reiki and craniosacral therapy (CST) respectively. I learned these methods from my precious teachers from both the East and the West. They help your mind and body to correct imbalances in order to heal themselves naturally. I do not focus on a specific disease or diagnosis, rather assist you in restoring overall balance and harmony. Many of my [clients have experienced relief from a wide variety of symptoms](https://mindbody-therapies.com/client-testimonials/) after only a few treatment sessions, which speaks for how profound and dynamic these modalities are; they increase energy and create clarity in the mind, which can also help enhance spiritual awareness. I am not a doctor, and treatments with me will not replace your doctor's visit. Nevertheless, my clients do report that after our sessions they experience quick and lasting results: Chronic pain, headaches, migraines, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, and other conditions that affect so many people today can resolve. Holistic health, physical & mental wellness, balance, and an overall sense of well-being can improve far more than most of us believe. About My Healing Journey I was born in [Berlin, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin) in the 1970s and grew up in a beautiful green suburb outside the city. My childhood friends and I enjoyed an open and safe environment, a seemingly endless emerald forest to run & play freely in, ride our bikes and even horses. However, all this freedom & beauty was abruptly overshadowed by the sudden loss of my father when I was only 7 years old. He was one of the many brave firefighters, who unfortunately died on duty far before his time. As a result of my father's passing, I experienced several decades of minor and major illnesses, and (until very recently) unresolved family trauma, which we did not even address for years after his passing. However, I was one of the fortunate few to have a wonderful step-father, who has been there for my mother and me until today. The main methods that helped me resolve and heal my own pain from this tragic loss was learning about the nature of mind (from many wonderful Tibetan Buddhist Lamas) as well as the mind-body therapies that I am very happy to share with others now. I found ways to \"heal myself\" that I will gladly share with you so that you can also heal any current or lingering physical or emotional injuries. My Path to Recovery with Western Medicine & Positive Transformation After the Unexpected Loss of a Parent In the early 2000s, after seeing many different \"specialists\", I finally found an MD in Berlin, who was completely different than all other Western doctors I had previously consulted. He utilized a comprehensive [holistic approach](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/holistic) that integrated kinesiology, acupuncture, and naturopathic dental work in his treatments. He always took special care and extra time to speak with me in order to thoroughly go through all issues (not just the physical), which is necessary to find out where the illness actually originated and where/what to specifically test for in the body. He advised against amalgam in dental fillings and against flu shots. At this point, some of you might be thinking, \"Wait a sec? Why?\" Well, he taught me that exposure to mercury - which is part of most modern vaccines - is a toxin to the body and that the flu virus in the annual vaccine is always the virus from the previous year, which has most-likely already mutated. He was not completely \"anti-vaccines\" (nor am I), however he was very selective. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in Combination with an Organic Diet, Meditation & Yoga This holistic Western doctor was the first to really help me heal in a fundamental way. The recommendations he provided were always very precise, based on the situation at hand, and [specifically tailored to the body as a whole as well as the psyche](https://mindbody-therapies.com/get-started/how-a-mindbody-therapy-session-works/). I finally realized how essential organic, non-processed, fresh, seasonal, and regional food is for a balanced lifestyle and well-being. When combined with proper sleep (minimum of 8 hours a night), limited alcohol consumption, and family-constellation work (e.g., by Bert Hellinger), we can all transform our lives for the better. Here it is important to note for my clients that food is our \"fuel\" and can act either as a medicine or a poison. If your diet consists strictly of processed foods, including added chemicals, preservatives, refined sugars, and pesticides like roundup, which is found in most non-organic fruits, vegetables, and grain products, the results you get from mind-body treatments might not last as long as they would if you were on a more beneficial, organic, mainly plant-based diet. Back to the story: At one point, my Western doctor in Berlin sent me to a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner for getting the right herbs. Surprisingly, he also sent me to a \"mindbody worker\" who started the real break through on more profound emotional levels. This \"healer\" would later become one of my first mind-body therapy teachers. Several years later, I met my main mind-body therapies teacher in the Heart Land of the U.S. (of all places ;-), and she has guided my education and regular training until today. What took me well over 30 years does not have to take you that long! About My Education & Corporate Career in International Operations & Human Resources (HR) throughout Europe & the United StatesAlong my own healing path, which included a tremendous amount of world travel, of course daily life never went away. After graduating with an MBA equivalent in Berlin, with a wonderful 13-month exchange program in San Jose, California's Silicon Valley (which I really enjoyed), I jumped all the way into the deep end of the so-called \"corporate world.\" I only mention this here so that my fellow brothers & sisters of office culture will know that I am very well aware of everything a 9-5 desk job entails as well as what \"road-warriors\" have to deal with all the time. I have worked as an entry-level secretary at Siemens to a BASF International Change & Project Manager for Europe-wide HR training management system centralization, and as the Director of Operations for Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in Berlin, Germany. Currently, I am very happy to be working with a local start-up, with a lot of heart, in beautiful Austin, Texas as their Director of People & Ops. Concerning my post-graduate studies: While completing the German equivalent of a master's degree in Business Administration, which led to the very time-intensive roles above, I also took four semesters of Western psychology. It was during that time when I met my first Tibetan Buddhist teachers. Over the following years, I started a traditional Tibetan Buddhist meditation practice and learned many of the ancient healing bodywork modalities that I utilize with my international clientele today. The Principles of Marina's holistic mind-body therapies The underlying principle of mind-body therapy is the understanding that what we call \"mind & form\" are inseparable. When we are in balance, [both the mind and the body have an innate ability to heal](https://mindbody-therapies.com/get-in-touch/). The methods I apply are not massage therapy. During a session, my clients lie on their backs on a massage table in comfortable clothing. Depending on what the mind-body needs in order to heal itself, I will gently place my hands on different areas of the body in specific ways, and without or only very gently manipulating the tissue. In essence, mind-body therapy is an active practice of loving kindness, compassion, and wisdom, and the primary goal is to help you overcome any limitations you experience in your body or mind at that moment. As a result, chronic pain and other issues may finally resolve, and well-being, health, and balance increase. "}
