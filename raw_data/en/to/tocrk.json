Here, we investigated direct inflammatory functions of major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. We observed that spike (S) protein potently IFNs in human and mouse macrophages. No such inflammatory response was observed in response to membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. When stimulated with extracellular S protein, human and mouse lung epithelial cells also produced inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Interestingly, epithelial cells expressing S protein intracellularly were non-inflammatory, but elicited an inflammatory response in macrophages when co-cultured. Biochemical studies revealed that S protein triggers inflammation via activation of the NF-B pathway in a MyD88-dependent manner. Further, such an activation of the NF-B pathway was abrogated in Tlr2-deficient macrophages. Consistently, and IL-1 in wild-type, but not Tlr2-deficient mice. Notably, upon recognition of S protein, TLR2 dimerizes with TLR1 or TLR6 to activate the NF-B pathway. Taken together, these data reveal a mechanism for the cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that TLR2 could be a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19. Editor's evaluation Your paper provides an important advance regarding the role of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as an inducer of the innate inflammatory cascade in both epithelial cells and macrophages. This is an important early event in development of the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 and may be of therapeutic relevance. [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68563.sa0](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68563.sa0) Introduction Coronavirus induced disease (COVID)19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emerged as a major public health crisis since December 2019 ( [Zhou et al., 2020b](#bib54); [Wu et al., 2020](#bib47); al., 2020](#bib19)). SARS-CoV-2 is a positive sense single-stranded RNA virus. Like other coronaviruses, such as SARS (retrospectively named SARS-CoV-1) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes infection in the respiratory tract, leading to either asymptomatic infection or a range of symptoms including cough, fever, pneumonia, respiratory failure, along with other complications like diarrhea and multi-organ failure ( [Vabret et al., al., 2020](#bib29); [Gu et al., 2005](#bib14)). In the absence of effective therapies, COVID-19 has caused over 4 million deaths worldwide by the end of 2021. Although our knowledge is still evolving, immunopathology caused by the cytokine storm plays a decisive role in COVID-19 pathogenesis ( [Vabret et al., 2020](#bib2)). SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells through its Spike (S) protein, which binds to the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), expressed on alveolar epithelial cells, allowing endocytosis of the viral particle ( [Zhou et al., 2020b](#bib54); [Hoffmann et al., 2020](#bib17)). Following endocytosis, the viral genome is replicated using both viral and host machineries, leading to the death of virally infected cells ( [Walls et al., 2020](#bib44)). The pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung is further worsened with inflammatory responses of innate immune cells such as macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils, which are activated by viral components and products of apoptotic and necrotic cells ( [Huang et al., 2020](#bib19)). While the innate immune response is essential for antiviral host defense, excessive inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are cytotoxic for respiratory epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells ( [Xu et al., 2020](#bib50)). Indeed, the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 is marked by higher concentrations of al., 2020](#bib46); [Mehta et al., 2020](#bib31)). Disease severity and death of COVID-19 patients have been correlated to the elevated expression of IL-6 and TNF ( [Huang et al., 2020](#bib19); [Hadjadj et al., 2020](#bib15)). However, our understanding of the precise mechanism of the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines during SARS-CoV-2 infection is very limited. The innate immune inflammatory response is initiated with the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and like receptors (RLRs). Activated PRRs involve multiple signaling adapters to activate transcription factors, such as NF-B, AP1, and IRF3, which regulate the expression of genes involved in immunity and inflammation. RNA sensing receptors such as TLR7, RIG-I, and MDA5 play a central role in antiviral immunity by inducing type I interferons (IFN and IFN) contribution of RNA sensing pathways in SARS-CoV-2-mediated immunopathology is yet to be explored, previous studies reported that macrophages and dendritic cells infected with SARS-CoV-1 produce proinflammatory chemokines, et al., 2005](#bib6); [Law et al., 2005](#bib27)). Consistently, inflammatory responses in severe COVID-19 patients are characterized by high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, but poor type I interferon response ( [Blanco-Melo et al., 2020](#bib2); [Hadjadj et al., 2020](#bib15)). Beyond these phenotypic observations, the precise mechanism of the hyperinflammatory response during SARS-CoV-2 infection is poorly understood. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus consisting of four major structural proteins\u2014S, nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelop (E) ( [de Wit et al., 2016](#bib7)). S protein binds to the receptor-binding domain of ACE2 through its S1 subunit allowing proteasomal cleavage of S protein and fusion of the S2 subunit with the host cell membrane ( [Hoffmann et [Walls et 2011](#bib1); [Shirato et al., 2011](#bib37)). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins are likely to be exposed to PRRs located on the cell membrane, endosome, and cytosol of the infected cell. However, our knowledge of the role of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins in the innate immune response is very limited. Here, we investigated the inflammatory properties of S, M, N, and E proteins and revealed that S protein, but not M, N, and E proteins, is a potent viral PAMP, which stimulates macrophages, monocytes, and lung epithelial cells. We demonstrated that S protein is sensed by TLR2, leading to the activation of the NF-B pathway and induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This study provides critical insight into the molecular mechanism that may contribute to cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results SARS-CoV-2 S protein induces inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in macrophages and monocytes Macrophages play a central role in the hyperinflammatory response during SARS-CoV-2 infection ( [Grant et al., 2021](#bib13)). To understand whether SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins can activate macrophages and monocytes, we stimulated human monocytic cell THP1-derived macrophages with recombinant S1, S2, M, N, and E proteins. Interestingly, both S1 S2 proteins induced proinflammatory cytokines IL6, TNFA, and being and monocytes recruit T lymphocytes and other immune cells in the inflamed tissue, aggravating inflammatory damage ( [Vabret et al., et three other structural proteins\u2014M, on cytokine production when cells were incubated with them together ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B](/articles/68563/figures#fig1s1)). However, other structural proteins, including M, N, and E, had no effect on S-induced inflammatory responses ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B](/articles/68563/figures#fig1s1)). Interferons are critical for adaptive response and antiviral immunity ( [Park and Iwasaki, 2020](#bib34)). However, THP1 cells and IFNB) and type-II (IFNG) interferons in SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins ( [Figure 1A](#fig1)). Notably, THP1 cells are not defective in producing interferons when activated by PolyI:C, cytokines and chemokines in response to S protein was dose dependent ( [Figure 1B](#fig1)). Similarly, S protein-induced inflammatory response was time dependent, with highest being at 8 hr post stimulation ( [Figure 1C](#fig1)). Notably, heat-denatured S2 protein failed to stimulate THP-1 cells, confirming the specificity of S protein and the requirement of its native structural configuration in inducing inflammatory response ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D](/articles/68563/figures#fig1s1)). S1 and S2 proteins from a different source (R&D) were equally potent in inducing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines 1\u2014figure supplement 1E](/articles/68563/figures#fig1s1)). To obtain direct evidence that S protein can induce inflammatory mediators in human immune cells, we stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with S2. There [Figure 1D](#fig1)). SARS-CoV-2 does not infect mouse cells since S protein does not bind with mouse ACE2 receptor. To understand whether recognition of S protein by ACE2 is required for induction of inflammatory molecules, we stimulated mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (mBMDMs) with S1 and S2. Surprisingly, not produce type-I and type-II interferons 2A](/articles/68563/figures#fig1s2)). Murine macrophage cell Il1b ( [Figure examine the role of ACE2 in S-induced inflammatory response, we stimulated THP1 cells with S1 or S2 in the presence or absence of ACE2 inhibitor (MLN-4760). Interestingly, inhibition of ACE2 did not affect production in response to S protein ( [Figure 1E](#fig1)). Taken together, SARS-CoV-2 S chemokines in macrophages and monocytes in an ACE2-independent manner. Epithelial cells produce inflammatory mediators in response to SARS-CoV-2 S protein SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects epithelial cells of the lung, kidney, intestine, and vascular endothelial cells ( [Hoffmann et al., 2004](#bib16); [Varga et al., 2020](#bib43)). However, it is poorly understood whether SARS-CoV-2-infected epithelial cells produce proinflammatory cytokines and contribute to cytokine storm of COVID-19 patients. To address this concern, we stimulated human lung epithelial cells A549 with S1 or S2 proteins. However, there IL1B, TNFA, CXCL1, and CXCL2 in A549 cells in S proteins at 4 hr post-stimulation ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/68563/figures#fig2s1)). Given that epithelial cells are weaker than innate immune cells in expressing inflammatory mediators, we wondered whether the expression of inflammatory molecules in epithelial cells is delayed. We, therefore, measured cytokines and chemokines in A549 cells following stimulation with S1 and S2 at 12 and 24 hr. Interestingly, both and hr post-stimulation ( [Figure 2A](#fig2)). Similarly, Calu3 cells, a commonly used human lung epithelial cell line, and mouse primary lung epithelial cells produced IL6, IL1B, TNFA, CXCL1, and CXCL2 ( [Figure 2B and C](#fig2)). We confirmed the expression of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF at protein levels in Calu3 and primary lung epithelial cells by ELISA ( [Figure 2D and E](#fig2)). [see all](/articles/68563/figures#fig2) Epithelial cells expressing S protein trigger inflammation in macrophages We next verified whether cytosolic S protein can stimulate epithelial cells to produce inflammatory molecules. Therefore, we transfected A549, Calu3, and HEK293T cells with plasmids expressing S protein or green fluorescent protein (GFP). The expression of S protein in HEK293T, A549, and Calu3 cells was confirmed by Western blotting ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A](/articles/68563/figures#fig3s1)). However, cytosolic S protein any cytokines 1B-D](/articles/68563/figures#fig3s1)). These data suggest that cytosolic S protein does not trigger inflammation in epithelial cells. Since airway and other epithelial cells are primary targets for SARS-CoV-2, we wondered whether virally infected epithelial cells trigger inflammatory response in macrophages and monocytes in a paracrine manner. To address this concern, we collected culture supernatant of A549-S, Calu3-S, or HEK293T-S cells and in culture ( [Figure 3A](#fig3)). However, culture supernatants of epithelial cells expressing S protein failed to induce cytokines IL6, IL1B, 3\u2014figure supplement 2A](/articles/68563/figures#fig3s2)). In fact, S protein was not detectable in the culture supernatant of HEK293T and A549 cells expressing S protein ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B](/articles/68563/figures#fig3s2)). Flow cytometric analysis suggested that S protein is primarily located in the cytoplasm, not on the cell surface ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C](/articles/68563/figures#fig3s2)). [see all](/articles/68563/figures#fig3) We then sought to examine whether innate immune cells become activated when they physically interact with S protein-expressed epithelial cells. Hence, we co-cultured S protein expressing A549, Calu3, or HEK293T [Figure and protein concentrations of IL-6, IL-1, and TNF in the culture supernatants of [Figure 3G to [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B](/articles/68563/figures#fig3s2), S protein was not detected in the culture supernatant of co-cultured cells as measured by ELISA (data not shown), suggesting that THP1 cells are activated by S protein-transfected epithelial cells through an unknown mechanism. To further confirm that cytosolic S protein expressed in epithelial cells can stimulate macrophages, we lysed HEK293T-S cells, and added the cell lysates culture ( [Figure 3\u2014figure HEK293T-S cells efficiently inflammatory cytokines in THP1 cells while no such induction was observed in response to cell lysate of HEK293T-GFP cells ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2G](/articles/68563/figures#fig3s2)). Taken together, these data imply that SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cells may stimulate macrophages and monocytes in a paracrine manner to produce inflammatory mediators. S protein activates the NF-B pathway Inflammatory genes are transcriptionally regulated by transcription factors that are activated by signaling pathways such as NF-B, MAPK, STAT3, and AKT. To obtain further insight into how S protein induces the expression of inflammatory mediators, we stimulated THP1 cells with S2 protein. Cell lysates collected at various times following stimulation were analyzed for the activation of these inflammatory pathways by Western blotting. As shown in [Figure 4A](#fig4), P65 and IB were phosphorylated MAPK pathways, including ERK, P38, and JNK, are often activated concomitant to the NF-B pathway. Surprisingly, there was no activation of ERK and JNK in S2 stimulated cells ( [Figure 4A](#fig4)). There was also no activation of the AKT pathway ( [Figure 4A](#fig4)), but STAT3 was phosphorylated ( [Figure 4A](#fig4)). Inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, can activate STAT3; thus, the observed activation of STAT3 could be a secondary response of S protein-mediated activation of the NF-B pathway. S2 protein also activated in cells ( confirm that S protein-induced inflammation was NF-B dependent, we inhibited the NF-B pathway using Sc514, an inhibitor of IKK, during stimulation with S protein. As expected, inhibition of the NF-B pathway abrogated inflammatory the NF-B pathway is TLR2 dependent Upon recognition of diverse PAMPs at the cell surface or in the endosome, TLRs activate the NF-B and MAPK pathways through the adapter protein MyD88. To verify if TLR pathways are involved in S protein-mediated activation of the NF-B pathway, we stimulated WT and Myd88/ BMDM with S2. Interestingly, there was no NF-B pathway in Myd88/ BMDM ( [Figure upon stimulation with S2 protein ( [Figure 5B](#fig5)). This observation suggests that S protein-mediated activation of the transcription factor NF-B involves TLR/MyD88 signaling axis. We then interrogated which TLR senses S protein. Since S is a glycoprotein, we anticipated that TLR2, a receptor for lipoprotein, or TLR4, which senses lipopolysaccharide and several other stimuli ( [Kawai and Akira, 2006](#bib23)), could be the immune sensor for S protein. Therefore, we stimulated Tlr2/ and Tlr4/ BMDMs with S2 protein and measured the activation of the NF-B pathway. There was no activation of the NF-B pathway in Tlr2/ BMDM, while activation of this pathway was intact in macrophages ( [Figure 5C](#fig5)). We confirmed in sensing Pam3CSK4, a ligand for TLR2, while they were fully TLR4 [Figure 5\u2014figure Tlr2/ macrophages ( 5D](#fig5)). Consistent to the defective activation of the NF-B pathway, there was no S S-tri is also sensed by TLR2, but not TLR4, as Tlr2/ macrophages failed to induce cytokines in response to S-tri, while no such defect in inflammatory response was observed in Tlr4/ macrophages ( [see all](/articles/68563/figures#fig5) Finally, to understand whether S protein induces inflammation in vivo and the role of TLR2 in this process, we administered S1 and S2 proteins into WT or Tlr2/ mice intraperitoneally (i.p.). 16 hr following administration of S protein, we measured the cytokine IL-6, IL-1, and TNF in the serum by ELISA. The concentrations of IL-6, IL-1, and TNF were elevated following administration of S proteins in WT mice, whereas no such induction was observed in Tlr2/ mice ( [Figure 5H](#fig5)). These data suggest that TLR2 is an innate immune sensor for SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and recognition of S protein by TLR2 leads to the activation of NF-B and induction of inflammatory mediators. TLR2 requires heterodimerization with TLR1 or TLR6 for sensing S protein It is known that TLR2 forms a heterodimer with either TLR1 or TLR6 on the cell surface that promotes ligand binding and propagation of signaling to the downstream kinases ( [Buwitt-Beckmann et al., al., 2008](#bib10); [Jin al., 2007](#bib21)). We, therefore, asked whether TLR1 or TLR6 is involved in sensing S-mediated inflammatory response. To this end, we used engineered HEK293T cells which selectively express TLR2 for NF-B stimulated reporter HEK-Blue cells with S1, S2, or S-tri, all activated NF-B HEK-Blue-TLR2, HEK-Blue-TLR1/2, and HEK-Blue-TLR2/6 6A and NF-B in TLR2, TLR1/2, and TLR2/6 cells by Western blotting. As shown in [Figure 6C](#fig6), NF-B was activated in S2 stimulated HEK-Blue-TLR2, HEK-Blue-TLR2/6 cells but not in HEK-Blue-Null and HEK-Blue-TLR4 cells. Consistently, the S-induced expression of IL6 and IL1B observed that both HEK-Blue-TLR1/2 and HEK-Blue-TLR2/6 cells responded to S protein, we wanted to clarify whether TLR1 or TLR6 can sense S protein independent of TLR2. To this end, we inhibited TLR2 in HEK-Blue-TLR cells with C29 during stimulation with S protein. C29 completely blocked S-mediated and confirming the essential role of TLR2 in S-mediated innate immune response. Notably, no activation of the reporter gene was observed in HEK-Blue-TLR2 or HEK-Blue-TLR4 cells stimulated with M, N, and E proteins ( [Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A, B](/articles/68563/figures#fig6s1)), further confirming that S, but not other structural proteins, is primarily responsible for the inflammatory response. With the above observation, we interpreted that TLR1 and TLR6 plays a redundant role or these co-receptors are dispensable in S-induced inflammatory response. To examine these possibilities, we knocked out TLR1, TLR2, TLR6, or both B](/articles/68563/figures#fig6s2)). On stimulation different TLR knockout cells with S2, TLR1-KO and TLR6-KO cells showed no defect in the inflammatory responses ( [Figure 6G](#fig6)). Interestingly, TLR1 and TLR6 double KO cells failed to induce any cytokine during stimulation with S protein ( [Figure 6G](#fig6)). Taken together, these data suggest that TLR2 requires dimerization with either TLR1 or TLR6 for sensing S protein and inducing subsequent inflammatory responses. Discussion Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and aberrant host immune responses are responsible for COVID-19 pathogenesis ( [Vabret et al., al., 2020](#bib2); [Grant et al., 2021](#bib13)). The initial host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection involves innate immune cells, such as macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic Cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory mediators produced by these cells inhibit virus replication, heal the damage, and activate the adaptive immune system. However, uncontrolled release of cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species often exert pathological consequences such as tissue injury, systemic inflammation, and organ failure ( [Vabret et al., 2020](#bib42); [Tay et al., 2020](#bib40); [Blanco-Melo et al., 2020](#bib2)). Non-surviving COVID-19 patients exhibited a massive influx of macrophages and neutrophils, but reduced T cells in their blood ( [Liao et al., 2020](#bib30)), pointing to the association of hyperactivation of innate immune cells with COVID-19 pathogenesis. Indeed, the innate immune response is heightened in the lung of COVID-19 patients ( [Zhou et al., 2020a](#bib53); [Xiong et al., 2020](#bib49)). A better understanding of the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 stimulates innate immune cells and activates inflammatory signaling pathways is key to finding better treatment regimens for COVID-19. Our finding that SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a potent viral PAMP involved in the induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines via TLR2-dependent activation of the NF-B pathway, therefore, is a valuable addition to the tremendous scientific effort aiming at combating COVID-19. Being an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 may activate RNA sensors TLR7, RIG-I, and MDA5, which are primarily responsible for production of type I interferons ( [Kawasaki and Kawai, 2014](#bib24)). Interestingly, the type I interferon response is attenuated in COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2 infected cells ( [Blanco-Melo et al., of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and PBMCs of COVID-19 patients also demonstrated higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, but not type I interferons ( [Xiong et al., 2020](#bib49)). Our knowledge of the type I interferon response of SARS-CoV-2 infected macrophages is limited. However, previous studies on SARS-CoV-1, which share 80% similarity with SARS-CoV-2, showed that macrophages and dendritic cells infected by SARS-CoV-1 produce chemokines CCL2, et al., 2005](#bib6); [Law et al., 2005](#bib27)). Lack of an interferon response can be explained by the fact that several structural and non-structural proteins including M, N, PLP, ORF3b, ORF6, and NSP1 inhibit type I interferon et al., [Frieman et al., 2007](#bib11); [Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007](#bib26)). Despite this evidence, the precise mechanism of excessive production of inflammatory cytokines along with reduced expression of type I interferons in COVID-19 patients remains elusive. In this regard, our findings that SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a potential trigger for proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines help understand why the inflammatory response in COVID-19 is marked by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, but poor type I interferon response. Our findings suggest that S protein of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 shares similar inflammatory function ( [Wang et al., 2007](#bib45); [Dosch et al., 2009](#bib9)). Further studies are required to clarify the relative contributions of S protein, viral RNA, and other non-structural proteins in COVID-19-associated cytokine storm. Inflammatory responses of COVID-19 patients are mostly contributed by innate immune cells, but they weakly express ACE2 ( [Ropa et al., 2021](#bib36)). There is no strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infects and propagates infection in immune cells. Thus, it is intriguing how innate immune cells become activated to produce inflammatory mediators during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We propose three mechanisms involved in hyperinflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, innate immune cells like macrophages and monocytes recognize S protein of SARS-CoV-2 at the cell surface through TLR2, leading to the activation of the NF-B pathway. Immune sensing of S protein is independent of ACE2 since mouse macrophages, whose ACE2 receptor does not bind to S protein, express inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to S protein. Further, inhibition of ACE2 does not impair S-induced inflammatory response, indicating that immunostimulatory function of S protein is independent of ACE2. Second, innate immune cells get activated by virally infected epithelial cells. Our data suggest that epithelial cells expressing S protein in the cytosol can activate macrophages when they physically interact. Although the underlying mechanism is not clear, macrophages may engulf or recognize cell surface molecules expressed on SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cells. In a third mechanism, like myeloid cells, epithelial cells can be activated by S protein extracellularly, leading to the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Although inflammatory responses of epithelial cells are weaker than that of innate immune cells, epithelial cell-derived chemokines recruit neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes in SARS-CoV-2-infected lungs and thereby contribute to immunopathology of COVID-19 patients. Our data demonstrate that TLR2 is the innate immune sensor for the S protein. Being a sensor for lipopeptides and lipoproteins, TLR2 plays a critical role in host defense against many bacterial and viral infections ( [Oliveira-Nascimento et al., 2012](#bib33)). Unlike other TLRs, 2006](#bib3); et 2007](#bib21)). Since an absence of either TLR1 or TLR6 does not impair S-induced inflammatory response, it seems that TLR2/1 and TLR2/6 heterodimers play redundant roles in sensing S protein. However, S protein failed to induce inflammatory response in macrophages defective in either TLR2 or both TLR1 and TLR6, suggesting that TLR2 alone cannot sense S protein, but requires dimerization with either TLR1 or TLR6. Although TLR2/1 and are considered receptors for tri-acylated and di-acylated lipopeptides, respectively, it is not uncommon that both TLR1 and TLR6 co-receptors can sense a particular PAMPs. For example, both TLR2/1 and TLR2/6 heterodimers are involved in the inflammatory response to core and NS3 proteins of hepatitis C virus ( [Chang et Like other MyD88-dependent TLR pathways, ligation of TLR2 leads NF-B and AP-1 ( [Kawasaki and Kawai, 2014](#bib24)). Interestingly, was activation of NF-B, AP-1 upstream signaling kinases such as ERK and JNK were not seen activated by S proteins. SARS-CoV-1 S protein activates the NF-B pathway al., 2007](#bib45); [Dosch et al., 2009](#bib9)). COVID-19 patients also exhibited increased activation of the NF-B pathway ( [Hadjadj et al., 2020](#bib15)). Interestingly, in contrast to these findings, a separate study reported that SARS-CoV-1 S protein-expressing baculovirus [Chang et al., 2004](#bib4)). Future studies dissecting the signaling pathway regulated by S protein of SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2 may reveal further insights into the mechanisms of S protein-induced inflammation. Given the importance of understanding the mechanism of hyperinflammatory response during COVID19, other research groups are also focused in exploring SARS-CoV-2 ligands and pathways involved in inflammatory et al., 2021](#bib51); [Zheng et al., 2021](#bib52)). The finding of two recent studies showing that S protein triggers inflammatory response is in agreement with our study ( [Shirato and Kizaki, 2021](#bib38); [Zhao et al., 2021](#bib51)). But, unlike our data, these studies showed that S protein is sensed by TLR4 instead of TLR2. However, a separate study demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 induces inflammation via TLR2, but not TLR4, supporting our data ( [Zheng et al., 2021](#bib52)). Interestingly, it was shown that E protein, but not S protein, is immunostimulatory ( [Zheng et al., 2021](#bib52)). While these studies greatly contributed to our understanding of the mechanism of COVID19 pathogenesis, some of these findings are inconsistent and conflicting. It appears that the recombinant S and E proteins used in those studies were generated in Escherichia coli. Thus, it is possible those recombinant proteins were contaminated by bacterial PAMPs. We used recombinant proteins produced in mammalian cell HEK293T, ensuring that the proteins are not contaminated by bacterial PAMPs. Using the endotoxin assay, we further confirmed that the recombinant S proteins are endotoxin-free. In summary, this study documents a potential mechanism for the inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a potent viral PAMP that upon sensing by TLR2 activates the NF-B pathway, leading to the expression of inflammatory mediators in innate immune and epithelial cells. The effort so far in combating the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented, making it possible for the development of a number of vaccines within a year of outbreak. Since S protein is being targeted by most of the vaccine candidates, it is important to consider its inflammatory function in vaccine design. Moreover, it is critically important to investigate whether TLR2 polymorphisms are associated with COVID19 pathogenesis and the role of TLR2 in antibody production against SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Considering the fact that new variants of SARS-CoV-2 with mutations in the S protein spread more easily and may confer more severe disease, the effectiveness of current vaccines remain uncertain ( [Plante et al., 2021](#bib35)). Thus, the importance of developing therapeutic drugs for COVID-19 remains high. This study suggests that TLR2 or its downstream signaling adapters could be therapeutically targeted to mitigate hyperinflammatory response in COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods Mice C57BL6/J (WT), Myd88/, Tlr2/, and Tlr4/ mice (all C57BL6/J strain), purchased from Jackson Laboratory were used in this study.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work. Decision letter after peer review: Thank you for submitting your article \"SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces inflammation via TLR2-dependent activation of the NF-B pathway\" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Coy Allen (Reviewer #2). The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Essential revisions: 1) The authors should discuss why their finding regarding TLR4 signaling appear to differ from those of other groups. 2) Repeat experiments with concurrent exposure to S1, S2, M, N, and E proteins would provide a more comprehensive picture of viral infection, and a nice comparison to S1 and S2 alone. 3) Experiments should be repeated in Calu-3 cells which are permissive to SARS-CoV-2. 4) The authors should probe the mechanisms of cytokine production in macrophage via TLR2. Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors): As mentioned above, in general the studies are well done and the data supports the overall conclusions of the manuscript. However, the following comments should be considered in an effort to strengthen the work presented: 1) TLR2 signals as a heterodimer. Thus, it is not clear if the mechanism proposed is associated with the TLR1/2 or the TLR2/6 heterodimer. This is critical information necessary to confidently define the mechanism proposed. 2) A549 cells are refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection (multiple sources, including The Lancet, 2020). Thus, their use here lacks significant physiological relevance. The epithelial cell studies should be conducted or at least confirmed in a more relevant cells line, such as the Calu-3 cells. 3) The direct connection between the TLR2/MyD88 mechanism in the mouse studies and the human cell line studies is lacking. The team states in the methods that they utilize C29 to attenuate TLR2 function in THP1s. However, the data provided is minimal. These studies should be repeated in all cell lines and include full panels of controls (such as polyI:C and PAM3) and evaluated across a time frame. A stronger study would be adding knockdown data in their cell lines to confirm the mouse studies. Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors): The findings of this study are of potential importance. However, they are preliminary in nature and the biologic relevance of these findings remains unclear. A number of potential approaches could be taken to show biological relevance. Do macrophages infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus induce cytokine production in a TLR2 dependent manner? Are human TLR2 polymorphisms associated with disease severity or response to vaccination? Is TLR2 required for effective vaccine responses for vaccines based on the spike protein? [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68563.sa1](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68563.sa1) Author response Essential revisions: 1) The authors should discuss why their finding regarding TLR4 signaling appear to differ from those of other groups. Thank you for the suggestion. Two recent publications reported that spike protein is sensed by TLR4 (Shirato K, Heliyon, 2021; Zhao Y, Cell Res, 2021), while another paper showed that SARS-CoV-2 triggers inflammation via TLR2 (Zheng M, Nat Immunol, 2021). We believe that the discrepant results of those studies are possibly due to endotoxin contamination of the recombinant proteins used in those studies as they were generated in E. coli. To avoid this problem, we used recombinant proteins generated in mammalian HEK293T cells. We have now included a discussion on this issue in page 16. 2) Repeat experiments with concurrent exposure to S1, S2, M, N, and E proteins would provide a more comprehensive picture of viral infection, and a nice comparison to S1 and S2 alone. As per recommendation, we have performed additional experiments in which we measured the effect of concurrent exposure of all structural proteins. The new data are now presented as Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B. Our data suggest that other structural proteins do not have any positive or negative influence on S-induced inflammatory responses. 3) Experiments should be repeated in Calu-3 cells which are permissive to SARS-CoV-2. We appreciate the reviewers' and editor's suggestion of repeating crucial experiments in Calu3 cells. We have now included a series of studies using Calu3 cells. The new studies are now presented as Figures 2B, 2D, 3C, 3F, 3H, Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2. 4) The authors should probe the mechanisms of cytokine production in macrophage via TLR2. We have demonstrated that S protein triggers inflammation via TLR2. Since TLR2 heterodimerizes with TLR1 or TLR6, it is a valid concern whether these coreceptors are involved in S-induced cytokine production. To address the reviewer's concerns, we have used engineered HEK293T cells expressing TLR2, TLR2/TLR1or TLR2/TLR6 and showed that S protein can be sensed by both TLR2/1 and TLR2/6 heterodimers. Further, we knocked down and TLR6 together in RAW264.7 macrophages. Following stimulation with S protein, we observed that cytokine production was abrogated when TLR2 and TLR1/6 were knocked out. These data suggest that upon ligation with S protein TLR2 in association with either TLR1 or TLR6 activates the downstream NF-B pathway. Our new findings are shown in Figure 6, Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 and Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2. Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors): As mentioned above, in general the studies are well done and the data supports the overall conclusions of the manuscript. However, the following comments should be considered in an effort to strengthen the work presented: We greatly appreciate the reviewer's insightful comments on this manuscript. We found that the reviewer's comments and concerns were very constructive and helped us improve the quality of our studies. We have performed a series of additional studies to thoroughly address all of the concerns. 1) TLR2 signals as a heterodimer. Thus, it is not clear if the mechanism proposed is associated with the TLR1/2 or the TLR2/6 heterodimer. This is critical information necessary to confidently define the mechanism proposed. The reviewer has pointed out an important concern. To understand whether heterodimerization with TLR1 and TLR6 is required for TLR2 in sensing S protein, we used HEK293T reporter cells overexpressing TLR2, TLR2/TLR1 or TLR2/TLR6. Interestingly, all three cells were responsive to S1, S2, and S-tri (Figure 6A-D). The inflammatory response of these reporter cells was inhibited when TLR2 was blocked by C29 (Figure 6E and F), suggesting that TLR2 is essential for sensing S protein. Given that HEK293T cells express low level of TLR1 and TLR6, but not TLR2, our data suggest that TLR2 heterodimerizes with either TLR1 or TLR6 in sensing S protein. To further verify this interpretation, we knocked out TLR2, TLR1, TLR6 or both TLR1 and TLR6 in the macrophage cell line. Following stimulation with S protein, we observed that cytokine production was abrogated in TLR2-KO and TLR1/6-double KO cells (Figure 6G, Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2). These data suggest that upon ligation with S protein TLR2 in association with either TLR1 or TLR6 activates the downstream NF-B pathway. 2) A549 cells are refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection (multiple sources, including The Lancet, 2020). Thus, their use here lacks significant physiological relevance. The epithelial cell studies should be conducted or at least confirmed in a more relevant cells line, such as the Calu-3 cells. We appreciate the reviewer's valuable suggestion. We have now included a series of studies using Calu3 cells. The new studies are now presented as Figures 2B, 2C, 3F, 3H, and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A and 1C, and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2. These experiments demonstrated that, like A549 cells, Calu3 cells are stimulated by S proteins to produce cytokines and chemokines. 3) The direct connection between the TLR2/MyD88 mechanism in the mouse studies and the human cell line studies is lacking. The team states in the methods that they utilize C29 to attenuate TLR2 function in THP1s. However, the data provided is minimal. These studies should be repeated in all cell lines and include full panels of controls (such as polyI:C and PAM3) and evaluated across a time frame. A stronger study would be adding knockdown data in their cell lines to confirm the mouse studies. We agree with the reviewers that additional controls should be included in studies where TLR2 was blocked by C29. We repeated the study including controls such as LPS and Pam3CSK4. Our data shown in Figure 5G confirms that C29 only inhibits the TLR2 pathway. As per reviewer's recommendation, we also evaluated the effect of C29 in Calu3 cells. Our data showed that C29 inhibits S-mediated cytokine production in Calu3 cells (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2). Finally, we show that RAW264.7 cells do not respond to S protein when TLR2 was knocked out with CRISPR/Cas9 (Figure 6G). All these data consistently and rigorously support the conclusion that TLR2 is the innate immune receptor for S protein and is involved in inflammatory response. Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors): The findings of this study are of potential importance. However, they are preliminary in nature and the biologic relevance of these findings remains unclear. A number of potential approaches could be taken to show biological relevance. Do macrophages infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus induce cytokine production in a TLR2 dependent manner? Are human TLR2 polymorphisms associated with disease severity or response to vaccination? Is TLR2 required for effective vaccine responses for vaccines based on the spike protein? We greatly appreciate the reviewers' insightful comments and finding our study potentially important. We completely agree with the reviewer that showing inflammatory response of macrophage to live SARS-CoV2 is TLR2 dependent would make our finding more compelling. Due to the limitation of available resources for working with live SARS-CoV2, we were not able to perform such an experiment. However, a recent study has already addressed this concern showing that macrophages from Tlr2-/- mice are defective in cytokine production when infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Zheng M, Nat Immunol, 2021). The reviewer's comments on the role of TLR2 in vaccine response and an association of TLR2 polymorphism in severity of COVID19 are insightful and important. However, addressing these concerns is out of scope of this study, but we are working on these topics which will be reported in our future studies. We briefly discussed this issue in page 18.

The striking difference in functional output with other IRFs is that IRF1 also drives the expression of various cell cycle inhibiting factors, making it an important tumor suppressor. Thus, it is critical to regulate the abundance of IRF1 to achieve a 'Goldilocks' zone in which there is sufficient IRF1 to prevent tumorigenesis, yet not too much which could drive excessive immune activation. Using genetic screening, we identified the E3 ligase receptor speckle type BTB/POZ protein (SPOP) to mediate IRF1 proteasomal turnover in human and mouse cells. We identified S/T-rich degrons in IRF1 required for its SPOP MATH domain-dependent turnover. In the absence of SPOP, elevated IRF1 protein levels functionally increased IRF1-dependent cellular responses, underpinning the biological significance of SPOP in curtailing IRF1 protein abundance. "}
