In this unique multicultural setting, the University offers a rich variety of academic programs andoutstanding support services, providing academic excellence for students.UTEP, the second oldest academic component of The University of Texas System, was established in 1914 as the Texas State School of Mines and Metallurgy toprepare professionals for the mining industry of the southwestern U.S. and Mexico. From its inception, the campus has featured architecture derived from theHimalayan kingdom of Bhutan. UTEP's unique buildings are the only examples of this ancient architecture in the Western Hemisphere. The motif, characterized bythick, sloped outer walls accented with a band of elaborate brickwork, was suggested by Kathleen Worrell, the wife of the college's first dean, after she sawphotographs of Bhutanese monasteries in an issue of National Geographic. Noted El Paso architect Henry Trost designed the first buildings, and architects havecontinued the theme through more than 90 years of campus expansion.The college's curriculum expanded in 1927 with the addition of liberal arts courses. The first Master of Arts degree was established in 1940. The institution wasrenamed Texas Western College in 1949 and the University of Texas at El Paso in 1967.

Lastupdated May 17, 2006.TUITION REBATES FOR CERTAIN BACCALAUREATE RECIPIENTSThe Texas Legislature has authorized a $1,000 tuition rebate for students who complete baccalaureate degrees with no more than three credits in excess of those required for theirdegrees. The purpose of the program is to provide a financial incentive for students to prepare for university studies while completing their high school work, avail themselves of academiccounseling, make early career decisions, and complete their baccalaureate studies with as few courses outside the degree plan as possible. Minimizing the number of courses taken by astudent results in financial savings to students, parents, and the state.The Texas Education Code, Section \u00a754.0065, authorizes UTEP to provide a tuition rebate to students who meet all of the following conditions:The Texas Education Code, Section \u00a754.0065, authorizes UTEP to provide a tuition rebate to students who:a. Enrolled at UTEP for the first time in the fall semester of 1997or later;b. Have requested a rebate for semester credit hours achieved toward their first baccalaureate degree;c. Have been Texas residents, have attempted all course work at a Texas public institution of higher education, and have been entitled to pay resident tuition at all times while pursuingthe baccalaureate degree;d. If enrolled for the first time in fall 2005 or later, graduate within four calendar years with a four-year degree or within five calendar years with a five-year degree if the degree is inarchitecture, engineering, or any other program determined by the Board to require more than four years to complete;e. Have attempted no more than three hours in excess of the minimum number of semester credit hours required to complete the degree in the catalog under which they were graduated.Hours attempted include transfer credits, course credit earned exclusively by examination (except that, for the purposes of this program, only the number of semester credit hours earnedexclusively by examination in excess of nine semester credit hours is treated as hours attempted), courses dropped after the official census date, for credit developmental courses,optional internship and cooperative education courses, and repeated courses. Courses dropped for reasons that are determined by UTEP to be totally beyond the control of the studentshall not be counted; andf. Have applied for rebates prior to receiving their baccalaureate degrees.Teaching CertificatesFor purposes of the $1,000 tuition rebate, students concurrently earning a baccalaureate degree and a Texas teaching certificate, required teacher education courses shall not becounted to the extent that they are over and above the free electives allowed in the baccalaureate degree program.Outstanding Student LoanTuition rebates shall be reduced by the amount of any outstanding student loan, including an emergency loan, owed to or guaranteed by the state, including the Texas GuaranteedStudent Loan Corporation.For more details about the Tuition Rebate Program, eligibility, and responsibilities, students should contact the Registration and Records Office, Academic Services Building, Room123 (915-747-5544). Further information on the Tuition Rebate Program can be found on the following websites:1. www.thecb.state.tx.us/rules/13/13F.htm2. www.capitol.state.tx.usTUITION LIMIT IN CASES OF CONCURRENT ENROLLMENTWhen a student registers at more than one public institution of higher education at the same time, tuition charges shall be determined in the following manner:1. The student shall pay the full tuition charge to the first institution at which he is registered; and in any event he shall pay an amount at least equal to the minimum tuition specified in thiscode.2. If the minimum tuition specified in this code for the first institution at which the student is registered is equal to or greater than the minimum tuition specified in this code for the secondinstitution at which the student is registered concurrently, the student shall not be required to pay the specified minimum tuition charge to the second institution in addition to the tuitioncharge paid to the first institution, but shall pay only the hourly rates, as provided in this code, to the second institution.3. If the minimum tuition specified in this code for the first institution at which the student is registered is less than the specified minimum tuition charge at the second institution (that is, ifthe second institution has a higher minimum tuition charge specified in this code), then the student shall first register at the institution having the lower minimum tuition and shall pay to thesecond institution only the amount equal to the difference between his total tuition charge at the second institution and his total tuition charge at the first institution, but in no case shall thestudent pay to the second institution less than the hourly rates as provided in this code.4. If a student is considered to be a Texas resident and therefore qualified to pay Texas resident tuition rates by one institution at which he is registered, that student shall be considered aTexas resident at each of the institutions at which he is concurrently registered for the purposes of determining the proper tuition charges. Nothing in this subsection shall be so construedas to allow a nonresident to pay resident tuition except at institutions covered by Section 54.060 of this code.GENERAL DEBTS OF STUDENTS OR ORGANIZATIONSThe University is not responsible for any debts contracted by individual students or by student organizations.

The University of Texas at El Paso | Terms Of Use | Privacy Statement | Required LinksRegister | Login Home Financial Information Academic Regulations Student Services Undergraduate Studies and University College Colleges and Degree Programs Text/HTML Residency for Tuition Purposes The Office of Admissions and Recruitment is responsible for determining residency status of students for tuition purposes. The Office is guided by the Texas Education Code, the Rules and Regulations for Determining Residence Status of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, and University regulations. Under the State statutes and regulations, a student or prospective student is classified as a resident of Texas, non-resident, or foreign student. A resident is an individual who is either a U.S. citizen, national, permanent resident alien, or an alien who has been permitted by Congress to adopt the U.S. as his or her domicile while in the United States and who has otherwise met the State requirements for establishing residency for tuition purposes. A non-resident is a citizen, national, or permanent resident of the U.S. or an alien who has been permitted by Congress to adopt the U.S. as his or her domicile while in this country and who has not met the State's requirement for establishing residency for tuition purposes. A foreign student is an alien who is not a permanent resident of the U.S. or has not been permitted by Congress to adopt the U.S. as his/her domicile. While these State requirements for establishing residency are complex and should be referred to in each particular circumstance, they generally require that an independent individual (18 years of age or older) establish a domicile in Texas and reside in the State for a period of 12 months prior to the census date of the academic term in which the person is enrolled. For minors and dependents, the parents or court- appointed legal guardian must have established a domicile and meet the residency requirements. The minor or dependent must be eligible to be claimed by the parent or court- appointed legal guardian on their federal income tax. An individual may also be classified as a Texas resident if the individual (1) graduated from a public or private high school or received the equivalent of a high school diploma in Texas; and (2) resided in Texas for at least three years as of the date the person graduated from high school or received the equivalent of a high school diploma; and (3) continuously resided in Texas for one year prior to the census date of the academic term in which the person is enrolled. An individual is classified as a Texas resident until the individual establishes a residence outside of the state of Texas. The following visa holders are eligible to establish a domicile in the United States and have the same privilege of qualifying for Texas residency as U.S. citizens: A-1, A-2, A-3, E- 1, E-2, G-1, G-2, R-1, R-2, V, OP-1, I-551, or I-688/A/B visas that have not expired. In order for these cardholders to be eligible for resident tuition, residency must be established. An individual who is classified as a non-resident or foreign student may qualify, under certain exceptions, for resident tuition rates and other charges while continuing to be classified as a non-resident or a foreign student. Military Certain military personnel, spouse and dependent children, are eligible to pay resident tuition rates as provided through Texas Education Code Section 54.058 (b)-(c). These provisions provide for nonresident members of the U.S. Armed Forces, members of Texas units of the Army or Air National Guard, or Commissioned Officers of the Public Health Service who are assigned to duty in Texas to pay the resident tuition rate for themselves, their spouses and dependent children. To qualify, the student must submit a statement once a year from an authorized officer in the services, certifying that he or she (or a parent or court-appointed legal guardian) will be assigned to duty in Texas at the time of enrollment and is not a member of the National Guard or Reserves who will be in Texas only to attend training with Texas units. In addition, Texas Education Code Section 54.058 (d) also provides resident tuition rates for a spouse or dependent child of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States, who is not assigned to duty in Texas but who has previously resided in Texas for a 6 month period if the member has provided at least one year preceding the first day of the term or semester a document with the applicable military service that is in effect on the first day of the semester. The document must indicate the member's permanent residence address in Texas and designates Texas as the member's place of legal residence for the purpose of income tax purposes. In addition, the member provides documentation that he or she has been registered to vote in Texas for the entire year preceding the first day of the semester and satisfies at least one of the following requirements: 1) has owned real property in Texas for the entire year preceding the first day of the semester and 2) has had an automobile registered in Texas for the entire year preceding the first day of the semester or at least one year preceding the first day of the semester executed a will that has not been revoked or superseded indicating that the member is a resident of Texas and deposited the will with the county clerk of the county of the member's residence under Section 71, Texas Probate Code. Other Exceptions Waivers of non-resident tuition for non-residents and foreign students are available for Participants in the Academic Common Market Residents of the eight New Mexico counties that border on Texas Recipients of competitive University scholarships of $1,000 or more Students whose families transferred to Texas as part of the State's plan for economic development U.S. Foreign Service Officers assigned to posts in Mexico Mexican citizens with demonstrated financial need Military stationed in Texas and their dependents NATO forces stationed in Texas and their dependents Teaching and research assistants and their dependents Higher education teachers and professors and their dependents Registered nurses enrolled in postgraduate nursing degree programs STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES Reclassification as a Non-Resident Persons who have been classified as residents of Texas will be reclassified as non-resident students whenever they report, or there is found to exist, circumstances indicating a change in legal residence to another state. If students who have been classified as residents of Texas are found to have been erroneously classified as a result of an omission or falsification will be reclassified as non-residents and will be required to pay the difference between resident and non-resident fees for the semesters for which they were erroneously classified. Reclassification as a Resident Persons classified as non-residents upon first enrollment may request reclassification. In order to have residence status reconsidered, students must complete the Core Residency Questions and submit it with the appropriate documentation regarding residency to the Office of Admissions and Recruitment prior to the first day of class of the semester for which the change is sought. After the form and documentation are reviewed, students are notified in writing of the residence decision. If students have been erroneously classified as non-residents and subsequently prove to the satisfaction of the University's residency official that they should have been classified as resident students, they will be reclassified as residents of Texas and will be entitled to a refund of the difference between the resident and non-resident fees for the semesters in which they were erroneously classified. All students are expected to pay the tuition assessed on or before the payment date for each semester as established by the University. All residence questionnaires and forms verifying non-resident tuition exemption status must be submitted prior to the first day of class of the term for which the change is sought. To prevent any delay in enrollment, students are encouraged to submit all forms at least two weeks before registration. Students should consult the Class Schedule for specific information concerning the submission of non- resident exemption forms. Non-Compliance with Institutional Rules and Regulations If students have obtained residency classification by virtue of deliberate concealment of facts or misrepresentation of facts, they may be required to repay the difference in tuition rates and may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, in accordance with the rules and regulations of The University of Texas at El Paso. For questions on residency or to update residency status, please contact the Office of Admissions and Recruitment at (915) 747-5890.

A new student will have the late registration fee waived as long as registration is made prior to the first day of class for the term. Late registrants are subject to the same regulations and course requirements as students who enroll on time. Each class missed because of late registration will be counted as an absence, and class or laboratory work missed will be counted as a zero unless the instructor grants permission to make up the work.

Audit fees: a. $10.00 per course for students concurrently enrolled at UTEP. b. $30.00 per course for students not concurrently enrolled at UTEP. c. No charge for students over 65 years of age. 7. Students should not register for courses they plan to audit. Course registration does not guarantee a seat as an auditor. Registering for the course will result in assessment of regular tuition and fees, in addition to the audit fees noted above. Dropping Courses and Complete Withdrawals Students may drop individual courses or completely withdraw from the University as described below. Refer to the on-line Academic Calendar at www.utep.edu/calendar or to the Class Schedule to identify the dates during which adds, drops, withdrawals, and pass/fail registration changes may occur. Student-initiated Drops It is the student's responsibility to officially drop a course that s/he no longer wishes to take. Failure to do so may result in a grade of \"F\" on the student's academic record. Athletes must receive permission from the Miner Athletic Advising Center before dropping a course. International students with F or J visas must receive permission from the Office of International Programs before dropping a course. Administrative Drops During registration periods for upcoming semesters, students will be dropped from registered courses for failure to meet prerequisites or corequisites after final grades have been posted for the current semester and before the beginning of late registration for next semester. A student may petition the department chair of the course in question for a prerequisite or corequisite waiver. At the discretion of the instructor, a student may be dropped from a course because of excessive absences or lack of effort. Students may also be administratively withdrawn from a course during the semester for other reasons, with the concurrence of the academic dean or department chair. A grade of \"W\" will be assigned before the course drop deadline and a grade of \"F\" after the course drop deadline. A grade of \"F\" received due to disciplinary action imposed by the University overrides a grade of \"W\" received through a student-initiated or faculty drop. Students will be notified of their drop through their UTEP e-mail account. Six Course Drop Limit Under section 51.907 of the Texas Education Code, beginning Fall 2007, all first-year students enrolled for the first time at any Texas public college or university are limited to six course drops during their academic career. This includes student and faculty initiated drops and courses dropped at other Texas public institutions. This policy does not apply to courses dropped prior to census day or to complete withdrawal from all courses for the semester. Students are encouraged to discuss options with their professors and advisors and to make use of campus resources before deciding to drop a course. Once the six-drop limit has been reached, subsequent course drops will be recorded with grades of WF. First-time, first-year students must meet with their academic advisor (or department chair of their major if they do not have an advisor) before dropping a course. The advisor will determine if the drop will count toward the six-drop limit prior to the course drop deadline. After the course drop deadline, the faculty member will determine if the drop will count toward the six-drop limit. There are exemptions that may allow a student to drop a course without having it counted toward the six-drop limit, but it is the student's responsibility to demonstrate good cause. Exemptions for good cause may include, but are not limited to: 1. A severe illness or other debilitating condition that affects the student's ability to satisfactorily complete the course; 2. The student's responsibility for the care of a sick, injured, or needy person if provision of that care affects the student's ability to satisfactorily complete the course; 3. The death of a person who is considered to be a member of the student's family or who is otherwise considered to have a sufficiently close relationship to the student that the person's death is considered to be a showing of good cause*; 4. Active duty service as a member of the Texas National Guard or armed forces of the United States of either the student or a person who is considered to be a member of the student's family or who is otherwise considered to have a sufficiently close relationship to the student that the person's active military service is considered to be a showing of good cause; 5. A change in the student's work schedule that is beyond the student's control and that affects the student's ability to satisfactorily complete the course; 6. Other good cause as determined by the University in consultation with the advisor; or 7. Other reason as described by the student. *The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board has specified \"family member\" to include spouse, child, grandchild, father, mother, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, aunt, uncle, nephew, niece, first cousin, step-parent, step-child, or step-sibling. \"Sufficiently close relationship\" includes a relative within the third degree of consanguinity plus close friends including, but not limited to, roommates, housemates, classmates, or others identified by the student and approved by the institution. The importance of a relationship is both highly individual and highly subjective. The Course Drop Form contains the exemption request and should be submitted to the advisor no later than the last day of class for the semester in question. Appeals to the denial of exemption requests may be made to the student's academic dean. A UTEP drop that counts toward the six course drop limit is noted on the academic transcript by a grade of WC. Transfer work that counts toward the limit is noted by a grade of TWC. The statement \"(#) Drops Count Toward the Six Course Drop Limit (Sec. 51.907, Texas Education Code)\" appears at the end of the UTEP transcript. This number reflects only UTEP drops. For further information, contact the Registration and Records Office, 123 Academic Services Building, or call (915) 747-5544. Complete Withdrawal From All Courses for the Semester Students who withdraw from all courses for the semester must do so in person through the Registration and Records Office. Students who cannot drop in person may submit a fax with signature or an e-mail using their UTEP e-mail account. Athletes must receive permission from the Miner Athletic Advising Center before dropping all classes. International students with F or J visas must receive permission from the Office of International Programs before dropping all classes.Students who drop all courses for the semester re-enroll based on their last academic standing as described in the Standards of Academic Performance section of this catalog. Students who were enrolled in professional programs such as Social Work, Clinical Laboratory Science, Nursing, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, and Speech Language Pathology should check with their major department to determine their eligibility for re-enrollment in the program. Complete withdrawal from all courses for a semester does not count toward the six-drop limit for first-time, first-year students who enter Fall 2007 or thereafter. A student who withdraws from all classes for the semester immediately loses access to services and privileges available to enrolled students. Complete Withdrawal Due to Academic Performance After final grades have been posted for the current semester, and before late registration begins for the next semester, students whose academic standing makes them ineligible to re-enroll will be withdrawn from all their classes for the next semester. For further details, refer to the Standards of Academic Performance section in this catalog. Complete Withdrawal Due to Medical Reasons A student who must withdraw completely due to medical reasons must submit a letter to the Student Business Services Office from the attending physician, clinical psychologist, or licensed clinical practitioner on official letterhead with an original signature, stating the date(s) within the semester that the student was under medical care and that the student must withdraw due to the medical condition. This letter must be submitted within the semester (or no later than 90 days after the end of the term for which the withdrawal is being requested). If the student is unable to act on his or her own behalf, a representative may do this for the student. Complete Withdrawal Due to Medical Condition s of a Family Member A student who must withdraw completely due to a medical condition of an immediate family member must submit a letter to the Student Business Services Office from the family member's attending physician, clinical psychologist, or licensed clinical practitioner. The letter must be submitted on official letterhead with an original signature, state the date(s) within the semester that the student's immediate family member was under medical care, and confirm that the student must withdraw to attend to the immediate family member's medical condition. This letter must be submitted within the semester (or no later than 90 days after the end of the term for which the withdrawal is being requested). If the student is unable to act on his or her own behalf, a representative may do this for the student. \"Immediate family member\" may be defined as a husband, wife, parent, sibling, child, legal guardian, or grandparent; other relationships may be considered on a case by case basis. Complete Withdrawal Due to Death of a Family Member A student who must withdraw because of the death of an immediate family member must submit an official death certificate to the Student Business Services Office during the semester (or no later than 90 days after the end of the term for which the withdrawal is being requested). \"Immediate family member\" is defined as a husband, wife, parent, brother, sister, son, daughter, legal guardian, or grandparent. Once documentation has been received, the student will be withdrawn and grades assigned. Complete Withdrawal Due to Death of Student Upon the death of a student, the student's parent, spouse, or legal guardian must submit an official death certificate to the Student Business Services Office within the semester (or no later than 90 days after the end of the term) so that the student can be withdrawn from all classes and grades assigned. Information concerning a refund can be found in the Refund of Tuition and Fees section of this catalog. Complete Withdrawal Due to Active Military Service Students who have to withdraw because they have been called to active military service must provide a copy of their military orders covering the affected semester to the Student Business Services Offices. Grades will be assigned as described below. Military personnel may select one of the withdrawal options below according to the Texas Education Code, Chapter 54, Subchapter A, Sec. 54.006: 1 . Receive a refund of the tuition and fees paid for the withdrawn semester (see NOTE below); 2 . If eligible, receive grades of Incomplete (I) from instructors, with the notation \"Withdrawn - Military\" appearing on the academic transcript (see section on Incomplete or In- progress Work in this catalog); or 3 . Receive an appropriate final grade or credit if the instructor determines that a substantial amount of coursework has been satisfactorily completed and sufficient mastery of the course material has been demonstrated. Grade Assignment for Drops and Withdrawals Grades will be assigned as follows when a student drops a course or completely withdraws from the University : 1. If a student drops a course before the official census date of a semester, neither the course nor a grade will appear on the student's academic record. 2. If a student drops from a course after the census date but before the student-initiated course drop deadline listed in the Class Schedule , a grade of \"W\" will be assigned. 3. If the student drops after the student-initiated course drop deadline, instructors will determine a grade of \"W\" or \"F\" for each course. A grade of \"W\" is considered only under exceptional circumstances and must be approved by the instructor and department chair for the course. A student may petition for a grade of \"W\" in writing with the necessary supporting documentation. Financial information concerning drops and withdrawals can be found in the Refund of Tuition and Fees section of this catalog. STUDENT EDUCATIONAL RECORDS Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) , 20 U.S.C. \u00a71232g and the Texas Public Information Act , Texas Government Code, \u00a7 552.001 et seq. are federal and state laws that provide students with the following rights with respect to their student educational records: To inspect and review the student's education records To consent to disclosure of the student's education records to third parties, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent To request amendment of the student's education records to ensure that they are not inaccurate or misleading To be notified of the student's privacy rights under FERPA To file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The University of Texas System and The University of Texas at El Paso have implemented a student records policy that adheres to these laws. Annual Notification The University will notify its students annually of their rights according to FERPA and of the procedures for exercising their rights. Definitions A \"student\" is an individual who is attending or has attended The University of Texas at El Paso. It does not include individuals who have been admitted but have not attended. \"Attendance\" includes attendance in person, by correspondence, online, and during periods when the student is working on an internship program. \"Education Records\" include records directly related to a student that are maintained by the University. Education records do not include: Records of instructional, administrative, and educational personnel that are in the sole possession of the maker (i.e. file notes of conversations), are used only as a personal memory aid, and are not accessible or revealed to any individual except a temporary substitute Records of the University campus police Student medical and counseling records created, maintained, and used only in connection with provision of medical treatment or counseling to the student, that are not disclosed to anyone other than the individuals providing the treatment. (While a student may not inspect his or her medical records, these records may be reviewed by a physician of the student's choice) Employment records unrelated to the student's status as a student Alumni records. \"Directory Information\" means information in a student's education record that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. UTEP designates the following minimum information as directory information: student's name; local and permanent address; e-mail address; telephone number; date and place of birth; field of study; dates of attendance; enrollment status; student classification; degrees, certificates and awards (including scholarships) received; photographs; participation in officially recognized activities and sports; weight and height of members of athletic teams; and the most recent previous educational agency or institution attended. \"University official with a legitimate educational interest\" is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit and health staff); a person or company with whom the University has contracted or affiliation (such as an attorney, auditor, collection agent, or clinical facility); a member of Board of Trustees; or a person assisting another University official in performing his or her tasks; who needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. Disclosure of Education Records Disclosure without Prior Consent of the Student The University will not disclose personally identifiable information from a student's education records without prior written consent of the student, except as authorized by FERPA. FERPA's authorizations for release without consent include the following: Directory Information. Directory information (as defined above) may appear in public documents and may otherwise be disclosed without student consent unless a student submits a written request to the registrar during the first 12 days of class of a long semester, or the first day of the minimester, or the first four class days of a summer session, to withhold such information from disclosure. Requests to withhold directory information will be honored by the University for only the current enrollment period; therefore, a request to withhold Directory Information must be filed each semester or term in the Registration and Records Office. University Officials . University officials with legitimate educational interests in the student's education records are allowed access to student education records. Inter-institutional disclosures may be made between institutions that administer or participate in joint programs or activities, in accordance with legitimate educational interest criteria. For example, if a student is concurrently enrolled in one component of the University of Texas and in another institution, or in two components of the University, or receives services from one component of the University and from another institution, or from two components of the University (or UT System), information from the student records of that individual may be disclosed by one University component to the other, or by the University component to the other institution, without obtaining the written consent of the student in accordance with legitimate educational interest criteria. This provision includes institutions participating in UT TeleCampus Programs. Other Institutions . The University may release a student's education records to officials of other educational institutions in which that student seeks or intends to enroll or is enrolled. Audit or Evaluation of Federal or State Education Programs. Authorized representatives of the Comptroller General of the United States, the Attorney General of the United States, the Secretary of Education, and state and local educational authorities may have access to student records in connection with the audit and evaluation of federal or state supported education programs, or in connection with the enforcement of federal law which relates to such programs. Financial Aid.

Organizations Conducting Studies . The University may release a student's education records to organizations conducting studies for, or on behalf of, educational agencies or institutions for the purpose of developing, validating, or administering predictive tests, administering student aid programs, and improving instruction, if such studies are conducted in a manner which will not permit the personal identification of students and/or their parents by individuals other than representatives of the organization, and the information will be destroyed when no longer needed for the purposes for which the study was conducted. The term \"organizations\" includes, but is not limited to, federal, state, and local agencies, and independent organizations. Accrediting Organizations . The University may release a student's education records to accrediting organizations in order to carry out their accrediting functions. Parents of Dependents . Parents of a student who is a dependent for federal tax purposes, as defined by Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, may have access to that student's education records without prior consent of the student. Parents may demonstrate the tax dependency of a student only by submitting to the University a copy of their most recently filed federal income tax return. Alternatively, a student may demonstrate tax dependency, and thus allow parental access to the student's records without prior consent of the student, by submitting to the University a signed statement of his or her tax dependency. If a dependent student's parents are divorced, both parents may have access to the student's records, so long as at least one parent claims the student as a dependent. Judicial Order or Subpoena . Information concerning a student shall be released in response to a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena. The University will make reasonable efforts to notify the student of an order or subpoena before complying with it. However, the University shall not notify a student of a subpoena if it is from a federal grand jury or is for law enforcement purposes, and it provides that the University shall not disclose to any person the existence or contents of the subpoena or any information furnished in response to the subpoena. Education records may be disclosed to the U. S. Attorney General or his or her designee in response to an ex parte order concerning an authorized investigation or prosecution of domestic or international terrorism, without prior notice to the student. Health and Safety. The University may disclose student information to persons in an emergency in order to protect the health and safety of the student or others in the University community. Disciplinary Hearing Results Disclosure to Victims: The University may disclose to an alleged victim of any crime of violence (as that term is defined in Chapter 1, Section 16 of Title 18, United States Code), or a non-forcible sex offense, the final results of any disciplinary proceeding conducted by the University against the alleged perpetrator of such crime or offense, regardless of whether the alleged perpetrator was found responsible for violating the University's rules or policies with respect to such crime or offense. Disclosure to Third Parties: The University may disclose the final results of any disciplinary proceeding against a student who is an alleged perpetrator of any crime of violence or non-forcible sex offense (as those terms are defined in 34 C.F.R. 99.39), if the student is found responsible on or after October 7, 1998, for violating the University's rules or policies with respect to such crime or offense.

The University may disclose to a parent or legal guardian of a student information regarding any violation of any federal, state, or local law, or of any rule or policy of the University, governing the use or possession of alcohol or a controlled substance, regardless of whether that information is contained in the student's education records, if the student is under the age of 21 at the time of disclosure to the parent, and the University determines that the student is responsible for a disciplinary violation with respect to such use or possession. Disclosure to the Student The student has the right, on request to the appropriate University official, to review all materials that are in the student's education records, except: Financial information submitted by the student's parent Confidential letters and recommendations associated with admissions, employment or job placement, or honors, to which the student has waived rights of inspection and review (the University is not required to permit students to inspect and review confidential letters and recommendations placed in their files prior to January 1, 1975, provided those letters were collected under established policies of confidentiality and were used only for the purposes for which they were collected) Education records containing information about more than one student, in which case the University will permit access only to that part of the record that pertains to the inquiring student. The Vice President for Business Affairs is the official custodian of UTEP records, and that office maintains a list of those individuals responsible for education records, which are maintained at the campus locations listed below. Requests for access to specific student records should be made in writing to the University official responsible for the particular record. Records covered by FERPA will be made available within forty-five days of the request. 1.

These copies will be made at the student's expense at rates authorized in the Texas Public Information Act, except that official transcripts will cost $ 5.00. Official copies of academic transcripts will not be released for students who have a delinquent financial obligation or financial \"hold\" at the University. Disclosure with Prior Consent of the Student With the student's prior consent, the University will release personally identifiable student information in education records or allow access to those records. Such consent must be written, signed and dated, and must specify the records to be disclosed, the party to whom the records are to be disclosed, and the purpose of the disclosure.

Requests to Amend Records A student who believes that his or her education records are inaccurate or misleading, or that the records violate his or her privacy rights, may informally discuss amendment of the record with the University office concerned with the particular record. If agreement is reached with respect to the student's request, the appropriate records will be amended. [Note: The substantive judgment of a faculty member about a student's work, expressed in grades and/or evaluations, is not within the purview of this right to seek amendment of education records.] If the record is not amended pursuant to the student's request, the University will inform the student of its decision and of the student's right to request a formal hearing. The request must be made in writing to the UTEP Vice President for Business Affairs who, within a reasonable period of time after receiving such request, will inform the student of the date, place, and time of the hearing. A student may present evidence relevant to the issues raised and may be assisted or represented at the hearing by one or more persons of the student's choice, including attorneys, at the student's expense. The hearing officer that will adjudicate such challenges will be appointed by the President. The decision of the hearing officer will be final, will be based solely on the evidence presented at the hearing, and will consist of a written statement summarizing the evidence and stating the reasons for the decision, and will be delivered to all parties concerned.

The University of Texas at El Paso | Terms Of Use | Privacy Statement | Required LinksRegister | Login Home Financial Information Academic Regulations Student Services Undergraduate Studies and University College Colleges and Degree Programs Text/HTML Curriculum and Classroom Policies COURSE INFORMATION Texas Common Course Numbering (TCCN) System The University of Texas at El Paso participates in the Texas Common Course Numbering (TCCN) System, which was developed to facilitate the transfer of general academic courses among Texas colleges and universities. Common courses are those freshman and sophomore level courses taught throughout Texas which correspond with the general description of courses or category of courses included in the Lower Division Academic Course Guide Manual . A UTEP course determined to be equivalent to a course listed in the Guide has the common course number listed below the UTEP course title in the individual course description of this catalog and a Texas state symbol is to the left of the course prefix and number. Students interested in transferring can refer to the common course number in each college or university catalog to determine course transferability among institutions. Course Numbering System Each course offered by The University of Texas at El Paso is identified by a four-digit course number. The first number indicates the level: 0 = developmental, 1 = freshman, 2 = sophomore, 3 = junior, 4 = senior, 5 or 6 = graduate. The second number indicates the semester credit hour value of the course. The last two numbers identify the course within its particular department. Lower-Division Courses are designated by a 1 or 2 as the first digit of the course number. Upper-Division/Advanced Courses are designated by a 3 or 4 as the first digit of the course number. The student should refer to the departmental and college requirements for specific conditions, if any, imposed on registration in advanced courses. Graduate Courses are designated by a 5 or 6 as the first digit of the course number. Maximum Course Load A student is permitted to register each term for the maximum number of semester credit hours listed below. Written permission from the academic dean must be obtained to take more than the maximum load. Students must have a grade point average above 2.0 to request permission. Term Maximum Hours Fall = 21 Spring (Wintermester) = 24 (combined terms), or 21 for Spring, or 6 for Wintermester. Summer (Maymester) = 15 (combined terms), or 9 for Summer, or 6 for Maymester. Enrollment Status Fall and Spring Hours Per Semester/Term Full-time = 12 or more Part-time = fewer than 12 Maymester and Wintermester Full-time = 3 or more Part-time = fewer than 3 Summer Sessions Full-time = 6 or more, or 3 in summer I and 3 in 8-week, or 3 in summer II and 3 in 8-week, or3 in summer I and 3 in summer II Part-time = fewer than 6 Students who are not eligible to enroll without conditions, who are on academic probation or academic suspension/dismissal, who have been readmitted or reinstated from such conditions, or who are in the START Program will have course load conditions imposed by their advisor or dean. Students should see the section entitled Standards of Academic Performance. Enrollment Verification For enrollment verification to financial aid, scholarships, loan agencies, insurance companies, etc., the following categories will be followed. Students are encouraged to enroll in the appropriate number of credit hours as required/specified by the agencies. Veteran students are recommended to consult with the campus Veterans Affairs Office. Fall and Spring: Hours Per Semester/Term Full-time = 12 or more 3/4 time = 9 - 11 1/2 time = 6 - 8 Less than 1/2 time = fewer than 6 Maymester and Wintermester: Full time = 3 or more 1/2 time = 2 Less than 1/2 time = 1 Summer Sessions: Full-time = 6 or more 3 in summer I and 3 in 8-week, or 3 in summer II and 3 in 8-week, or 3 in summer I and 3 in summer II 3/4 time = 4 - 5 1/2 time = 3 Less than 1/2 time = fewer than 3 Students participating in the Career and Professional Development Services Cooperative Education Program and are only enrolled in a CO-OP course will be classified as full- time for the semester/term. Limits on Undergraduate Course Enrollment In most instances, a student may enroll in an undergraduate class a maximum of three times; further enrollment requires PERMISSION OF THE STUDENT'S ACADEMIC DEAN . A student may enroll more than three times in a variable-topic, studio, performance, workshop, or other course that is identified as \"may be repeated for credit.\" This includes enrollments that result in a grade of \"W,\" \"F,\" \"D,\" or \"P.\" It does not apply to courses taken prior to a student's re-enrolling under \"Option 2\" as described under the Reinstatement After Extended Absence or Academic Fresh Start portions of this catalog. Individual colleges may have more restrictive policies. A student may not enroll in a course in which a grade of \"C\" or higher has been previously earned (except for a variable-topic, studio, performance, workshop, or other course that is identified as \"may be repeated for credit\"). Moreover, a student may not enroll in a course in which he or she has an unresolved grade of \"I\". Courses Taken on a Pass/Fail Basis Some courses are graded only on a Pass/Fail basis (grade of \"S\" or \"U\"). Check with the appropriate academic department for a listing of these courses. These courses may be used to fulfill degree requirements if so specified on the student's degree plan. In addition, an undergraduate student whose cumulative grade point average is 2.0 or higher may take courses on a Pass/Fail basis with the following conditions: 1. A maximum of four courses attempted on a Pass/Fail basis may be used to fulfill degree requirements, as free electives only. 2. Such courses may not be reserved for graduate credit. 3. Not more than two such courses may be taken in a long semester or one in a summer session. 4. Courses taken on a Pass/Fail basis may not be counted toward the minimum residency requirements. 5. To obtain credit for the course, the student must meet the minimum standard and do all assigned work required for the grade of \"A,\" \"B,\" \"C,\" or \"D.\" 6. No course graded Pass/Fail may be used to fulfill any degree requirement in the College of Engineering. 7. Business majors may not take any course offered by the College of Business Administration on a Pass/Fail basis. To enroll on a Pass/Fail basis in courses that are not normally graded Pass/Fail, a student must: 1. Obtain a Pass/Fail form and approved signature from the academic dean of his/her college. 2. Submit the approved form to the Records Office by the submission deadline listed in the Class Schedule . Election of the Pass/Fail option is irrevocable after the submission deadline. Pass/Fail courses are not included in the grade point average calculation. There is no assurance that Pass/Fail courses will be accepted as transfer credit by another institution. Reservation of Work by Undergraduates for Graduate Credit Ordinarily, undergraduates are not eligible to take graduate courses. A student who already has a baccalaureate degree is not eligible to reserve courses for graduate credit, but it is possible for seniors to register in graduate courses in their last semester under the following conditions: 1. The undergraduate must need no more than 12 semester hours (or six semester hours in summer session) of work to complete all requirements for the first baccalaureate degree and must have a grade point average of at least 3.0 in junior and senior-level courses.2. These 12 hours (or less) must all be completed in the same semester or summer session in which the graduate courses are taken. 3. Total registration for all work must not exceed 15 semester hours (or 9 hours in a summer session). 4. Enrollment in graduate courses must be approved prior to registration by the graduate advisor of the department, the undergraduate dean, and the Dean of the Graduate School. 5. This option is limited to one term. An undergraduate cannot count credit for graduate courses toward the baccalaureate degree. It will be reserved for credit toward a graduate degree. A form for reserving courses is available in the Graduate School. Approval to reserve work for graduate credit neither constitutes nor implies admission to any graduate program. Repetition of Courses Students may repeat courses at UTEP under either of the following conditions: 1. Repetition of UTEP freshman level courses (1XXX): grade of \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", or \"F\" is earned when the course is repeated for the first time, the previously earned grade is automatically excluded from the GPA calculation. Both grades earned remain on the academic record and the record will be annotated with the symbol (E-Excluded) next to the first grade. The last grade earned is the official grade for a course. 2. Repetition of UTEP freshman level courses (1XXX) after the first time and repetition of non-freshman level courses (2XXX, 3XXX, 4XXX): All grades earned remain on the academic record and are included in the GPA calculation. Exceptional circumstances may be reviewed by the student's academic dean in consultation with the appropriate faculty member. Grade replacement and GPA recalculation may not occur after graduation. A grade received as a result of disciplinary action is not eligible for grade replacement for GPA recalculation. The record will be annotated with the symbol (D) next to the grade. Note : Students are cautioned that courses taken at UTEP and repeated at another college or university are not eligible for GPA recalculation, even if it is the first-time repetition of freshman-level courses (1xxx). Transfer courses are not calculated in a student's UTEP GPA. Class Attendance The student is expected to attend all classes and laboratory sessions. It is the responsibility of the student to inform each instructor of extended absences. When, in the judgment of the instructor, a student has been absent to such a degree as to impair his or her status relative to credit for the course, the instructor may drop the student from the class with a grade of \"W\" before the course drop deadline and with a grade of \"F\" after the course drop deadline. Excused Absences for University-Recognized Activities Students who will be absent while representing the University in officially recognized University activities (sports, band, professional conferences, etc.) must notify the Dean of Students not less than ten days prior to the absence. The Dean of Students will provide the student with a letter of excuse for the professors. It is the student's responsibility to give the letter to the professors prior to the official recognized activity. Students following these procedures will be permitted to make up both assignments and examinations in consultation with faculty. Absence for Religious Holy Days \"Religious holy day\" means a holy day observed by a religion whose places of worship are exempt from property taxation under Section 11.20, Tax Code . Section 51.9111of the Texas Education Code related to absences by students for observance of religious holy days states that the institution shall excuse a student from attending classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day, including travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused under this subsection may not be penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment from which the student is excused within a reasonable time after the absence. The student must provide written notice to the instructor of each course that he/she will be absent for a religious holy day not less than 10 days prior to the absence . If a student and an instructor disagree about the nature of the absence being for the observance of a religious holy day as defined therein, or if there is similar disagreement about whether the student has been given a reasonable time to complete any missed assignments or examinations, either the student or the instructor may request a ruling from the Provost or his or her designee. The student and instructor shall abide by the decision of the Provost or his/her designee. Military Leave Section 51.9111, Texas Education Code, provides that students be excused from scheduled classes or other required activities if the student is called to and participates in active military service for a reasonably brief period and that the student shall be allowed to complete an assignment or exam within a reasonable time after the absence. Students called to active military service must provide a copy of their military orders to the instructor of each course. Further information is available under Complete Withdrawal Due to Active Military Service. Absence from Examinations A student absent from a test during the semester is graded zero unless another policy is set by the instructor. Dead Day This specific day will be scheduled one day after the last day of classes during the fall and spring semesters. The following policy will be observed: 1. No classes will be held on this day, except classes which meet once a week on that day 2. Make-up exams should be left to the discretion of each individual instructor 3. All student work (i.e., research papers, lab reports, term paper, etc.) should be due prior to this day 4. If a comprehensive final is given, no new material, quizzes, or exams should be given two calendar days prior to Dead Day, and attention should be given to review of semester material. Implementation of this recommendation is to be left to the discretion of the individual instructor. Final Examinations Exemption from final examinations may not be given. Final examinations are scheduled to be two hours, forty-five minutes in length and take place during the final examination period. It is the policy of the University not to administer a second final examination in a course. It is also University policy that students shall not have more than two final examinations in a single day. In the unlikely event that the examination schedule results in a student having three final examinations on a single day, the faculty member upon the request of the student shall reschedule the second of that student's three examinations. Academic Integrity The University of Texas at El Paso prides itself on its standards of academic excellence. In all matters of intellectual pursuit, UTEP faculty and students must strive to achieve excellence based on the quality of work produced by the individual. In the classroom and in all other academic activities, students are expected to uphold the highest standards of academic integrity. Any form of academic dishonesty is an affront to the pursuit of knowledge and jeopardizes the quality of the degree awarded to all graduates of UTEP. It is imperative, therefore, that the members of this academic community understand the regulations pertaining to academic integrity and that all faculty insist on adherence to these standards. Any student who commits an act of academic dishonesty is subject to discipline. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, collusion, the submission for credit of any work or materials that are attributable in whole or in part to another person, taking an examination for another person, and any act designed to give unfair advantage to a student or the attempt to commit such acts. Proven violations of the detailed regulations, as printed in the Handbook of Operating Procedures (HOP) , and available in the Office of the Dean of Students and on the homepage of the Dean of Students at www.utep.edu/dos, may result in sanctions ranging from disciplinary probation, to a failing grade on the work in question, to a failing grade in the course, to suspension or dismissal, among others. GRADES AND GRADE POINT AVERAGES Grade Point Value Grade Meaning per Semester Hour A Excellent 4 B Good 3 C Average 2 D Below Average but Passing 1 F Failure 0 WC Assigned to a dropped course that will count toward the Six Course Drop Limit 0 WF Assigned to a dropped course that exceeds the Six Course Drop Limit 0 Courses in which the above grades were earned are included in the grade point average (GPA), which is calculated as follows: (1) determine grade points by multiplying the number of semester hours each course is worth by the grade point value of the grade received; (2) divide the total number of grade points earned by the total number of semester hours attempted in which the above grades were earned. (Total Grade Points/Total Attempted Hours = GPA) The following grades are not included in grade point average calculations: Grade Meaning I Incomplete S Satisfactory, in a Pass/Fail course U Unsatisfactory, in a Pass/Fail course P In Progress W Withdrawal CR Transfer credit or credit by examination A* Satisfactory B* Satisfactory Unsatisfactory N A temporary administrative grading notation often meaning not reported by the faculty or some other administrative problem TWC Assigned to a dropped undergraduate transfer course taken at another Texas public college or university; counts toward the Six Course Drop Limit. Midterm Grades for Freshmen At mid-semester, all students with fewer than 30 semester hours will receive midterm grades. This midterm grade report is designed to give beginning students an early indication of their academic progress. Midterm grades are not recorded on the student's academic record, computed in the cumulative grade point average, or in the academic standing. Incomplete or In-Progress Work Assignment of the grade \"I\" is made only in exceptional circumstances and requires the instructor to file an outline of the work to be completed and the time span (not to exceed one calendar year) allowable for completion with the academic dean. In no case may repetition of the course be assigned as work to be completed. If the work has not been completed at the end of the specified time, the \"I\" will be changed to an \"F.\" A student may not enroll in a course in which he/she has an unresolved grade of \"I.\" The grade of \"P\" (in progress) is limited to specific courses in which re-enrollment is required. This includes all thesis courses (5398-5399, 6320-6321), graduate internships, and certain undergraduate courses. Grade ChangesAll student-initiated grade reviews and grade appeals shall be made no later than one year after the official grade has been released to the student; for a student who has graduated , the deadline is three months following the semester in which the degree was awarded. Any student may request that the faculty member review and re-evaluate a grade previously given. The student may then seek assistance from the department chair or the academic dean in obtaining a grade review. After a grade review, a formal grade appeal process is available in cases in which a student wishes to appeal a grade assigned by the instructor. The formal appeal shall be officially filed with the Student Welfare and Grievance Committee no later than one year after the official grade has been released to the student; for a student who has graduated, the filing deadline is three months following the semester in which the degree was awarded. See Student Life Policies and Procedures section-Student Grievance Procedures in this Catalog for additional information. Grades may be changed as a result of (1) grade change initiated by the instructor and approved by the appropriate department chair; (2) grade change initiated by the department chair for cases in which the instructor cannot be contacted and there exists clear and convincing evidence for a grade change; (3) grade change due to disciplinary action imposed by the Dean of Students or Hearing Officer for violation of university rules; or (4) action taken by the Student Welfare and Grievance Committee in grade appeal procedures. Grades determined as a result of actions taken in items (3) or (4) above are final and not subject to change. No other grade change shall occur without the consent of the instructor. The Registrar shall notify the student and the instructor of any change of grade. College/Major Academic Standing Selected colleges or majors may also require students to maintain a 2.0 GPA for courses taken within the college or within the major. A student whose college/major GPA falls below a 2.0 after completing a specified minimum number of hours of the designated course work in the college/major will be placed on probation within the college/major. This minimum shall be nine hours unless specified differently on the degree requirements for the college/major. If the student's college/major GPA remains below a 2.0 after completing nine additional hours of course work in the college/major [or the designated college/major probationary period (students should refer to the individual degree requirements to determine the applicable probationary period)], the student will be placed on suspension from the college/major for a minimum of one semester. A student who is on suspension from a college/major may continue to enroll in the University if the student changes majors and meets the GPA requirements of the new college/major. A change to a new major in the same college will require permission from the dean. A student who wishes to re-enroll in the same major after a suspension must submit a Petition for Reinstatement to the College/Major to the student's academic dean. If the petition is approved, the student will be permitted to re-enroll under academic probation, plus any special conditions which may be imposed by the academic dean. It is recommended that students who are suspended from the college/major receive career counseling through the University Counseling Center. Students who have been suspended for a period of one semester and have been allowed to re-enroll in that college/major must attain a GPA of 2.0 in the college/major after the completion of nine additional hours of course work in the college/major [or the designated college/major probationary period (student should refer to the individual degree requirements to determine the applicable probationary period)]; failure to do so will result in suspension from the college/major for a minimum of one year. A student who is allowed to re-enroll after this suspension and does not achieve a 2.0 GPA in the college/major [or the designated college/major probationary period (student should refer to the individual degree requirements to determine the applicable probationary period)] will be dismissed from the college/major. A change of major will be required if the student wishes to continue to enroll in the University. Any appeal from the regulations governing academic performance shall be directed to the dean of the college in which the student is a major, who is empowered to grant relief in unusual cases if the circumstances warrant such action. This policy is in addition to the policies concerning academic standing within the University. Any penalties concerning eligibility to re-enroll arising from the University's academic standing policy shall take precedence over any provisions within this policy. Standards of Academic Performance Undergraduate students are expected to maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.0 (\"C\" average) for all work attempted at UTEP, and at least a GPA of 2.0 for all course work required in the major field of study. These are University-wide minimum requirements for the conferral of any bachelor's degree, but higher minimum standards of performance are required in some programs. When final grades of each term are posted to the student academic record, both term GPA (for the semester or session just ended) and cumulative GPA (for all work attempted at UTEP) are included. In addition, designations appropriate to the student's past academic performance and eligibility to re-enroll at the University are included. These designations are as follows: Eligible to Re-enroll A student whose cumulative GPA is 2.0 or higher is eligible to re-enroll. Academic Probation A student whose cumulative GPA falls below 2.0 will be placed on academic probation. A student on academic probation must have permission to re-enroll. Students in an entering student program should seek this permission from their entering student advisor. Other students should seek this permission from their academic dean. A student will remain on academic probation as long as the term GPA is at least 2.0 and the cumulative GPA is below 2.0. Academic Suspension for One Semester A student on academic probation whose term GPA is below 2.0 will be placed on academic suspension for one semester. A student thus suspended MAY NOT re-enroll at the University until one long semester or full summer session has elapsed. Academic Suspension for One Year A student on academic probation who has already been placed on academic suspension for one semester, and whose term GPA is less than 2.0, will be placed on academic suspension for one year. A student thus suspended MAY NOT re-enroll at the University until one full calendar year has elapsed. Academic Suspension for Two Years A student who has been placed on academic suspension for one year and whose semester and cumulative GPA is below 2.0 will be placed on academic suspension for two years. A student thus suspended MAY NOT re-enroll at the University until two full calendar years have elapsed. Re-enrollment Following Academic Suspension A student wishing to re-enroll after his/her academic suspension period is over must submit a Petition for Reinstatement with the academic dean of the previous major or, if the student is selecting a new major, the dean of the intended new major. If reinstated, the student will be permitted to re-enroll under academic probation, plus any special conditions of the Petition for Reinstatement. Any appeal from the regulations governing academic performance shall be directed to the dean of the college in which the student is a major, who is empowered to grant relief in unusual cases if the circumstances warrant such action. Any student who attempts to circumvent the academic performance regulations is subject to disciplinary action.Reinstatement of Students after Extended Absence At the time of reinstatement to the University after an absence of at least two academic years, a student has the option of: 1. Continuing with the academic record and GPA as they stand, and completing all remaining requirements for graduation; or 2. Beginning anew, with no courses attempted earlier at UTEP counted toward the degree, nor counted in the cumulative GPA calculations. This option may be elected only once. If Option 1 is chosen, the GPA will be computed according to rules in force at the time of re-entry. If Option 2 is chosen, notation will be made in the student's record indicating that portion of the record which is to be involved in computing requirements for graduation. There is no assurance that courses attempted prior to this option will be accepted as transfer credit by another institution. In either case, all courses taken and grades earned will remain on the official academic record. Pursuit of the degree under either option does not exempt the student from the provisions of the \"seven-year rule\" (students should refer to the Catalog Requirements section). If the student was not eligible to re-enroll at the end of the last period of enrollment at the University, submission of a Petition for Reinstatement with the academic dean of either the previous or intended major is required at the time of reinstatement. The petition will specify which of the two options has been chosen.

All students, regardless of when originally enrolled, are required to abide by current academic regulations. RESIDENCE Work counting toward the degree must be completed in residence at the University as follows: 1. A total of at least 25% of the semester hours (a minimum of 30 semester hours) 2. Twenty-four of the last 30 semester hours 3. Twelve semester hours of advanced courses in the major subject must have been completed not more than three years prior to the date of graduation CATALOG GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS In order to graduate, a student must fulfill the specific course and degree requirements of the catalog in effect at the time of his/her admission, or of any subsequent catalog in effect during his/her enrollment with the approval of the academic dean, provided that the required courses are still being offered. A student must complete all requirements within seven years or be subject to the degree requirements of a subsequent catalog. The seven-year period begins with the year the catalog was issued, regardless of the student's first semester of enrollment. Students entering the University for the first time during a summer session are subject to the requirements of the catalog for the next fall term, or of a later catalog. A student transferring from a Texas two-year institution may select a catalog that was in effect prior to the first semester of enrollment at UTEP, as long as the student was following UTEP's degree plan while enrolled at the community college. DEGREE PLAN Students are advised to obtain and follow their major's degree plan when they first enroll at the University. Students are required to select a major and file a degree plan with the academic dean of that major by the time they complete 60 semester hours. CHANGE OF MAJOR A student who wishes to change majors must obtain permission of the dean of the college of the new major. CONCENTRATIONS AND MINORS Students interested in pursuing a concentration or minor in an area of study should refer to the college curriculum in the catalog or consult with their major advisor for further details. COMPLETION OF FRESHMAN-LEVEL COURSES All freshman-level courses that are required by specific course number must be completed before the student has completed 90 hours toward the degree. No credit for these freshman-level courses will be granted toward fulfilling the minimum credit hour requirements for the degree even though the courses must be completed. ONE-HOUR COURSES No more than six one-hour courses may be counted toward completion of the minimum total hours required for a degree (unless degree requirements specify otherwise), except with specific approval of the academic dean. MAJOR EXAMINATIONS At the discretion of the department concerned, a comprehensive examination may be required in the major subject under the following conditions: 1. Four hours written, or three hours written and one hour oral.2. The department fixes the time and place, and supervises the examination. 3. In case of failure, the student may take another examination on a date determined by the department. GRADE POINT AVERAGE REQUIRED FOR GRADUATION A minimum grade point average of 2.0 must be achieved in all course work at The University of Texas at El Paso and in all transfer work counted toward the degree. The UTEP cumulative grade point average consists of all grades earned at this institution regardless of their applicability toward a degree. Transfer credits may be counted toward meeting degree requirements, but transfer grades and grade points do not enter into UTEP grade point average calculations. A minimum grade point average of 2.0 is required in the major. This is intended as a University-wide minimum and does not prevent a college from requiring a higher GPA in specific majors or programs, provided appropriate approvals have been obtained. GRADUATION Degrees are conferred at the end of each long semester (December, May) and each summer session (July). Formal commencement ceremonies are held in May for all candidates who complete degree requirements during the spring semester and in December for fall candidates. Summer candidates may participate in the May commencement ceremony if no more than 6 hours are needed to complete the degree during the summer session. Summer candidates names will not appear in the May program. Summer candidates who do not participate in May commencement may participate in December commencement. Summer graduates' names will only appear in the December program. Students must apply for graduation and pay the appropriate fee in order to be considered candidates for graduation. The application process begins with the academic dean and should be initiated during the next-to-last semester or session and completed no later than the published deadline in the Class Schedule. Summer candidates participating in May commencement must complete the application process by the published deadline for May graduation. The paid graduation application form will be collected by the Student Business Services Office for processing by the Registration and Records Office. SECOND BACHELOR'S DEGREE Applicants for a second baccalaureate degree must complete at least 24 semester hours at The University of Texas at El Paso, in addition to those counted toward the baccalaureate degree requiring the higher number of semester hours of credit. These additional hours must include at least 6 advanced hours in the major subject of the second degree. A student working toward a second bachelor's degree will register as an undergraduate senior. A student who earned the first bachelor's degree at another institution must complete at least 30 hours at UTEP, including completion of the legislative requirements of 6 hours of American History and 6 hours of Political Science covering the Constitutions of the United States and Texas. POSTHUMOUS DEGREE A posthumous degree may be awarded only if the student was enrolled in courses that would have allowed the student to complete all work for the degree, and if the student had the appropriate grade point average in the required areas. For further information, individuals may contact the appropriate dean's office.

Phone: (915) 747-5858 honors@utep.edu https://www.utep.edu/honors DIRECTOR: Jaime Mendez The University Honors Program offers students a richer, more intense and challenging academic experience, as well as closer, more personalized contact with faculty and fellow students. Enrollment in Honors classes is limited to 20, and students must apply to participate in the program. To be eligible, entering freshmen must have graduated in the top 10% of their high school class or have obtained a 1030 on the SAT or 22 on the ACT. A cumulative 3.3 grade point average is the criterion for admitting current or transfer students. Participants must complete a minimum of one Honors course per year and maintain a 3.3 GPA to remain active in the program. The program offers two options: the University Honors Degree or the University Honors Certificate. Both options are described below. University Honors Degree Candidates earn Honors in the areas specified below and complete either 6 hours of upper-division Honors credit or a 6-hour Honors Senior Project in their major. Recipients of the University Honors Degree must complete Honors courses in the following areas: ENGL 1311-1312 At least 3 hours of English must be taken for Honors credit. Entering freshmen who place beyond ENGL 1312 take an Honors sophomore or upper-division English course. HIST 1301-1302 At least 3 hours of History must be taken for Honors credit. POLS 2310-2311 At least 3 hours of Political Science must be taken for Honors credit. 8 hours of courses given by the departments of Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Geological Sciences, or Physics. At least 3 hours of science must be taken for Honors credit. 6 hours of upper-division work for Honors credit. Three of these hours may be satisfied through approved independent study. OR A 6-hour Honors Senior Project (HON 4395-4396). In several departments, completion of the Honors Senior Project may also qualify the student for Departmental Honors recognition: Political Science, Psychology, History, Chemistry, Biological Sciences, Geological Sciences, and Physics. AND Additional Honors credits as required to bring the total to 30 hours; the hours may be earned by enrolling in Honors sections or by contracting for Honors credit in non-Honors courses. With approval of a student's departmental advisor and the University Honors Program Director, a maximum of 6 of these 30 hours may be taken on a Pass/Fail basis. Credits obtained on this basis may be used only for elective credit if approved by the student's academic department. Courses taken on a Pass/Fail basis are disregarded in determining the grade point average, thereby encouraging Honors students to enroll in a course for which they might otherwise feel inadequately prepared. Completion of the above requirements with a cumulative GPA of 3.3 or higher at the time of graduation entitles the student to receive the University Honors Degree. The notation \"University Honors Degree\" will be added to the permanent academic record and the diploma, and all Honors courses completed will be designated with (H). University Honors Certificate Students who wish to pursue a less comprehensive Honors curriculum may elect to obtain the University Honors Certificate by completing 18 hours of Honors course work. At least 6 hours must be upper-division, and 3 of these may be by approved independent study. A maximum of 3 Honors hours may be taken on a Pass/Fail basis, with the same restrictions described for such courses in the University Honors Degree option. Upon graduation with a cumulative GPA of 3.3 or higher, the notation \"University Honors Certificate\" will appear on the permanent academic record and on the diploma, and all Honors courses completed will be designated with (H) on the transcript. Honors Contract Credit Honors Program members enrolled in a non-honors section of a course may arrange for special additional work under the supervision of the instructor. If the contract work isHonors Program members enrolled in a non-honors section of a course may arrange for special additional work under the supervision of the instructor. If the contract work is completed and evaluated as Honors quality by the instructor and a grade of \"A\" or \"B\" is earned for the course, Honors credit for the class will be awarded. Detailed guidelines and contracts are available at the Honors House. Honors Transfer Credit If an Honors course is completed elsewhere, at an institution accredited by the Association for Colleges and Schools, and transfers as the equivalent of a course offered at UTEP, the Honors course will be counted toward hours needed to earn the University Honors Degree or Certificate. If the Honors course completed elsewhere transferred to UTEP as TR (transfer elective), then the course must be evaluated on an individual basis by the Honors Director in consultation with the Honors Advisory Committee and a decision made based on course content. A minimum of 50% of the credits required for the Honors Degree or Certificate must be completed at UTEP. Honors Recognition at Commencement The Honors Degree candidate is recognized at commencement by the wearing of a gold stole. The Honors Certificate candidate is recognized at commencement by the wearing of a lilac cord. Students completing a senior thesis/project are recognized at commencement by wearing a dark green cord. Honors (HON) 3300 Honors Colloquium (3-0) Examination of a special topic or interdisciplinary area. May be repeated once for undergraduate credit as subject varies. Course approved for undergraduate or graduate credit. 4395 Honors Senior Thesis (0-0-3) 4396 Honors Senior Thesis (0-0-3) Students will conduct an Honors Senior Project under the direction of a faculty member in their major department and report the findings, usually in thesis form. During the first semester (HON 4395), a prospectus prepared by the student describing the proposed project will be filed with the Honors office. The completed project will be defended orally. Prerequisite : Department approval. National Student Exchange Program (Texas Education Code, 51.930) UTEP is a member of the National Student Exchange (NSE) Program that is a consortium of more than 170 state-supported colleges and universities. The program offers students the opportunity to broaden their academic and cultural awareness in different geographic settings across the United States and its territories and Canada. Students are able to enroll at a host university for up to one academic year and pay in-state tuition rates. To qualify, a student must be full-time at the time of the application and the semester prior to the exchange, have a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.5, and be a sophomore or junior at the time of the exchange. For more information, interested individuals should contact the NSE Coordinator at the Honors House at (915) 747-5858 or log onto http://www.buffalostte.edu/nse. OTHER HONORS PROGRAMS Departmental Honors Program A student who wishes to earn departmental Honors must complete a senior thesis, senior project, or other special requirement, depending on the department. A departmental faculty member directs the project or thesis. The director, along with a departmental honors committee, judge the student's work, and outside referees may be consulted if deemed appropriate. Students may include departmental honors credits with University honors credits, upon consultation with the University Honors Program Director, in order to earn Honors at both levels. The following offer Departmental Honors: Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Geological Sciences, History, Physics, Political Science, and Psychology.. Dean's List At the end of each fall and spring semester, the Registration and Records Office prepares a Dean's List for each undergraduate college of all full-time undergraduate students who have completed at least 12 collegiate hours and have earned a minimum semester grade point average of 3.5. This honor is noted on the student's academic record. Academic Honors The University of Texas at El Paso offers three opportunities for students to achieve special recognition for academic performance at graduation. Graduation with any of these honors adds a special distinction to academic records and diplomas and may enhance the prospects for graduating seniors to enter graduate and professional schools or the job market. To be eligible for the following recognitions and/or programs, candidates must be among the most able and intellectually curious of students and must meet minimum GPA requirements. Upon graduation, honors in the following categories will be awarded for each baccalaureate degree conferred upon students who have completed at least sixty (60) of the total required credit hours for their degrees at The University of Texas at El Paso: 1. Summa Cum Laude (Highest Honors) will be awarded to students who attain a minimum UTEP grade point average of 3.90. 2. Magna Cum Laude (High Honors) will be awarded to students who attain a minimum UTEP grade point average of 3.80, but who do not qualify for Highest Honors. 3. Cum Laude (Honors) will be awarded to students who attain a minimum UTEP grade point average of 3.50, but who do not qualify for High or Highest Honors. In computing the minimum grade point average for academic honors at graduation, only grades earned at UTEP applied to the degree will be included. Requirements for honors for a second degree include the above requirements with the additional stipulation that the student completes thirty (30) hours beyond the original baccalaureate requirements. Honors cords worn at commencement recognize the following academic achievements: University Academic Honors- Highest Honors........... Gold High Honors.................

The handbook supplements the rules and regulations of the Board of Regents and covers student conduct and discipline, use of University facilities, student organizations, educational records, and student publications. The Rules and Regulations of the Board of Regents of The University of Texas System are at http://www.utsystem.edu/bor/rules. The President has delegated responsibility for the administration of student discipline (academic dishonesty and general misconduct) to the Dean of Students. STUDENT CONDUCT While enrolled at the University, a student neither loses the rights nor escapes the responsibilities of citizenship. Any student who engages in conduct that is prohibited by the Board of Regents' Rules and Regulations or University rules, or by federal, state, or local law is subject to discipline whether such conduct takes place on or off campus or whether civil or criminal penalties are also imposed for such conduct. All students are expected and required to obey the law, to show respect for properly constituted authority, and to observe correct standards of conduct. The University of Texas at El Paso administers student discipline according to established procedures of due process. Procedures are defined and described in the Rules and Regulations of the Board of Regents, Rule 50101, and in the Handbook of Operating Procedures (HOP). Students should check with appropriate departments whose policy or regulation is of concern. If necessary, students need to refer to the rules in the Regents' Rules ( http://www.utsystem.edu/bor/rules ) and the HOP. The Office of the Dean of Students can assist on this matter. This set of rules is available at http://hoop.utep.edu. OTHER PROHIBITED CONDUCT Computer usage violations, use of alcoholic beverages, dishonesty, gambling, defacing of property, endangering the health or safety of others, use of obscene and threatening language, altering of records, possession or use of firearms, failure to respond promptly to official notices, etc. will subject the student to disciplinary action. Penalties, which may be imposed in conjunction with the approved disciplinary procedures, include the following: written warning, disciplinary probation, withholding of grades, withholding of official transcript or degree, restitution, failing grade, denial of degree, suspension and expulsion, revocation of degree and withdrawal of diploma, or other penalty as deemed appropriate under the circumstances. In addition, certain privileges may be withdrawn consistent with the severity of the offense and the rehabilitation of the student. These penalties may be imposed singularly or in any combination upon individuals, groups, or organizations. ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES POLICY The use, possession, or sale of any illegal drugs or narcotics including any amount of marijuana on the campus of the University is a violation of Regents' Rules and Regulations and of University policies governing student conduct, as well as a violation of State Law. In addition to possible criminal prosecution, student offenders will be subject to disciplinary action by the University. The minimum disciplinary penalty that will be imposed is suspension from the University for a specified period of time and/or suspension of rights and privileges. DISRUPTIVE ACTS POLICY The obstruction or disruption of any teaching, research, administrative, disciplinary, public service, or other authorized activity on campus or under the authority of the University or on property owned or controlled by the University is prohibited and will subject the student or group of students to disciplinary action. HAZING POLICY Hazing in state educational institutions is prohibited by both state law ( Sections 51.936 and 37.151 et seq., Texas Education Code ) and by the Regents' Rules and Regulations (Rule 50101). Individuals or organizations engaging in hazing could be subject to fines and charged with criminal offenses. Additionally, the law does not affect or in any way restrict the right of the University to enforce its own rules against hazing. The law defines hazing as any intentional, knowing, or reckless act, occurring on or off the campus of an educational institution, by one person alone or acting with others, directed against a student, that endangers the mental or physical health or safety of a student for the purpose of pledging, being initiated into, affiliating with, holding office in, or maintaining membership in any organization whose members are or include students at an educational institution. Hazing includes but is not limited to: 1. Any type of physical brutality, such as whipping, beating, striking, branding, electronic shocking, placing of a harmful substance on the body, or similar activity; 2. Any type of physical activity, such as sleep deprivation, exposure to the elements, confinement in a small space, calisthenics, or other activity that subjects the student to an unreasonable risk or harm or that adversely affects the mental or physical health or safety of the student; 3. Any activity involving consumption of food, liquid, alcoholic beverage, liquor, drug, or other substance which subjects the student to an unreasonable risk or harm or which adversely affects the mental or physical health of the student; 4. Any activity that intimidates or threatens the student with ostracism; that subjects the student to extreme mental stress, shame, or humiliation; or that adversely affects the mental health or dignity of the student or discourages the student from entering or remaining registered in an educational institution; or that may reasonably be expected to cause a student to leave the organization or the institution rather than submit to acts described in this subsection; 5. Any activity that induces, causes, or requires the student to perform a duty or task which involves a violation of the Penal Code.5. Any activity that induces, causes, or requires the student to perform a duty or task which involves a violation of the Penal Code. Activities which under certain conditions constitute acts that are dangerous, harmful, or degrading, in violation of Rules include but are not limited to: calisthenics, such as sit-ups, push-ups, or any other form of physical exercise; total or partial nudity at any time; the eating or ingesting of unwanted substance; the wearing or carrying of any obscene or physically burdensome article; paddle swats, including the trading of swats; pushing, shoving, tackling, or any other physical contact; throwing oil; syrup, flour, or any other individual interrogation; forced consumption of alcoholic beverages either by threats or peer pressure; lineups intended to demean or intimidate; transportation and abandonment (road trips, kidnaps, walks, rides, drops); confining individuals in an area that is uncomfortable or dangerous (hot box effect, high temperature, too small); any type of personal servitude that is demeaning or of personal benefit to the individual members; wearing of embarrassing or uncomfortable clothing; assigning pranks such as stealing, painting objects, harassing other organizations; intentionally messing up the house or room for clean up; demeaning names; yelling and screaming; and requiring boxing matches or fights for entertainment. The University regards any form of hazing as a major violation, and any individual and/or registered student organization participating in such activities will be held responsible for those actions. According to the law, a person can commit a hazing offense not only by engaging in a hazing activity, but also by soliciting, directing, encouraging, aiding, or attempting to aid another engaging in hazing; by intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly allowing hazing to occur; or by failing to report first-hand knowledge that a hazing incident is planned or has occurred in writing to the Dean of Students or other appropriate university officials. The fact that a person consented to or acquiesced in a hazing activity is not a defense to prosecution for hazing under this law. An organization can commit a hazing offense if the organization condones or encourages hazing or if an officer or any combination of members, pledges, or alumni of the organization commits or assists in the commission of hazing. In an effort to encourage reporting of hazing incidents, the law grants immunity from civil or criminal liability to any person who reports a specific hazing event in good faith and without malice to the Dean of Students or other appropriate university officials, and It immunizes a person from participation in any judicial proceeding resulting from that report. SOLICITATION In general, solicitation is prohibited in any building, structure, or facility of the UTEP campus. Certain university activities are permitted as defined in the Handbook of Operating Procedures. This handbook is available for review in the Office of the Dean of Students and on the homepage of the Dean of Students at https://studentaffairs.utep.edu/dos.

Although certain immunizations are required only of students enrolled in specific health-related courses and programs, all students are strongly encouraged to obtain them for their own protection. Students may obtain information regarding the consequences of outdated immunizations for certain diseases, the age groups most vulnerable to these vaccine preventable diseases, and local providers of immunization services from the Student Health Center located on campus. Immunizations are available at the Student Health Center. To obtain information call (915) 747-5624. In accordance with State law, the following immunizations are required for all students enrolled in health-related courses which will involve direct patient contact in medical or dental care facilities or who come in contact with human biological fluids or tissue. Students enrolled at UTEP are charged a reasonable fee for all immunizations. Measles : proof of two doses of measles vaccine administered on or after the first birthday and at least 30 days apart or proof of immunity; Mumps : proof of one dose of mumps vaccine administered on or after the first birthday or proof of immunity; Rubella : proof of one dose administered on or after the first birthday or proof of immunity; Tetanus/diphtheria : proof of one \"booster\" dose of tetanus/diphtheria (within 10 years); Hepatitis B virus (HBV) : proof of serologic immunity to HBV or certification of immunization with a complete series of Hepatitis B vaccine.

For further information, students should contact the Student Health Center or the academic department responsible for the courses or programs requiring immunizations. A form on which the required immunizations can be documented is available from the Admissions Office or the Student Health Center. Since most secondary schools are required by law to maintain similar records, a copy of the high school immunization record may be submitted. The Student Health Center is responsible for maintaining a record of those students who comply with these requirements and may recommend the placement of an administrative hold on records if they have not been met. The Student Health Center provides the required immunizations for all academic programs; however no X-ray screening is available.

To demonstrate its commitment, UTEP has adopted a policy and procedural steps to protect both the rights and well being of those students, employees, and patients who may be infected with HIV or HBV as well as to prevent the spread of infection. No individual with HIV or HBV infection will be discriminated against in employment, admission to academic programs, health benefits, or access to facilities. Students with HIV or HBV infection may attend all classes without restriction, as long as they are physically and mentally able to participate and perform assigned work and pose no health risks to others.

BACTERIAL MENINGITISThis information is being provided to all new college students in the state of Texas. Bacterial Meningitis is a serious, potentially deadly disease that can progress extremely fast-so take utmost caution. It is an inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. The bacterium that causes meningitis can also infect the blood. This disease strikes about 3,000 Americans each year, including 100-125 on college campuses, leading to 5-15 deaths among college students every year. There is a treatment, but those who survive may develop severe health problems or disabilities. What are the symptoms ? High fever Rash or purple patches on skin Light sensitivity Confusion and sleepiness Lethargy Severe headache Vomiting Stiff neck Nausea Seizures There may be a rash of tiny, red-purple spots caused by bleeding under the skin. These can occur anywhere on the body. The more symptoms, the higher the risk, so when these symptoms appear, seek immediate medical attention. How is Bacterial Meningitis diagnosed? Diagnosis is made by a medical provider and is usually based on a combination of clinical symptoms and laboratory results from spinal fluid and blood tests. Early diagnosis and treatment can greatly improve the likelihood of recovery. How is the disease transmitted? The disease is transmitted when people exchange saliva (such as by kissing, or by sharing drinking containers, utensils, cigarettes, toothbrushes, etc.) or come in contact with respiratory or throat secretions. How do you increase your risk of getting Bacterial Meningitis? Exposure to saliva by sharing cigarettes, water bottles, eating utensils, food, kissing, etc. Living in close conditions (such as sharing a room/suite in a dorm or group home). What are the possible consequences of the disease? Death ( in 8 to 24 hours from perfectly well to dead ) Permanent brain damage Kidney failure Learning Disability Hearing loss, blindness Limb damage (fingers, toes, arms, legs) that requires amputation Gangrene Coma Convulsions Can the disease be treated? Antibiotic treatment, if received early, can save lives and chances of recovery are increased. However, permanent disability or death can still occur. Vaccinations are available and should be considered for: Those living in close quarters College students 25 years old or younger Vaccinations are effective against 4 of the 5 most common bacterial types that cause 70% of the disease in the U.S. (but does not protect against all types of meningitis). Vaccinations take 7-10 days to become effective, with protections lasting a minimum of 8 years. The cost of the vaccine varies, so check with your health care provider. Vaccination is very safe-most common side effects are redness and minor pain at injection site for up to two days. Vaccination is available at the UTEP Student Health Center, on a walk-in basis.

STUDENT RIGHT-TO-KNOW AND CAMPUS SECURITY ACT In compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Police and Campus Crime Statistics Act of 1998, the University of Texas at El Paso collects specified informationIn compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Police and Campus Crime Statistics Act of 1998, the University of Texas at El Paso collects specified information on campus crime statistics, campus security policies, and institutional completion or graduation rates. Pursuant to the federal law, alleged victims of violent crime are entitled to know the results of campus student disciplinary proceedings concerning the alleged perpetrators. UTEP makes timely reports to the campus community on crimes considered to be a threat to students and employees, and crimes are reported to campus police or local police agencies. Every October, UTEP publishes and distributes an annual report of campus security policies and crime statistics to all current students and employees, provides copies of the report to applicants for enrollment or employment upon request, and submits a copy of the report to the Secretary of Education upon request. The annual campus crime statistics report references crimes which occur on the campus property owned or controlled by UTEP or within a contiguous geographic area of the institution. Statistics for off-campus buildings or property owned by student organizations that are registered by the institution are also reported when such statistics are available from local police departments. In addition, UTEP publishes in the annual security report its policy regarding sex-related offenses, including sexual assault prevention programs, education programs to promote awareness of sex offenses, administrative disciplinary procedures and sanctions for offenders, and counseling and student services for victims. UTEP annually calculates and discloses institutional completion or graduation rates for undergraduate students to all prospective and current students. (The federal requirement for calculation of a completion or graduation rate applies only to institutions of higher education that admit undergraduate students who are enrolling for the first time at an institution of higher education and have not enrolled previously at any other institution of higher education.) Prior to the offer of athletically-related student aid to a potential student athlete, UTEP provides certain information on graduation rates specified by the Act to the prospective student and to the student's parents, guidance counselor, and coach.

You should consult with the appropriate department to determine what other requirements must be met.. The following first-year and transfer admission sections apply to citizens and permanent residents of the United States. Our international students should refer to the section on International Student Admission for admission and testing requirements. First-year Admission Documents Required If you have never attended another college or university, have been enrolled in dual credit programs, have earned credit by examination, or may have earned college credit through non-traditional methods (i.e. some military credit or credit from specialized schools), you should apply for freshman admission.

High School Graduation We welcome your application if you are a graduate of a high school recognized by state, private, or regional accrediting agencies and have the academic preparation necessary to pursue a baccalaureate degree.

For early notification of acceptance, you should have verification of test scores, expected date of graduation, and a transcript sent directly from the high school to the Office of Admissions and Recruitment. After graduation, a final, official transcript must be submitted. High School Preparation If you are a high school student and intend to enroll at the University, you must take a college preparatory curriculum. All of our new first-year students admitted to UTEP within five years of graduation from a Texas high school must have completed the Recommended High School Program. The Recommended Program consists of 24 credits, including 16 credits in the core areas. Completion of the Recommended High School Program also makes you eligible for consideration for the need-based TEXAS Grant Program. Our graduates of non-Texas high schools, private schools, or home schools must meet the 16-credit core requirement, in addition to any other requirements set by their high schools. If your high school preparation varies from that described, you will be reviewed on an individual basis. SUBJECT CREDITS * English 4 Mathematics (Algebra I and II and Geometry) 3 Students interested in Science and Engineering need an additional year of 1 Pre-calculus, Trigonometry, Analytic Geometry or Elementary Analysis.

(The Recommended High School Program also includes credits in Health and Physical Education, Fine Arts, Speech, Technology Applications, and Electives.) You may satisfy the requirement above if your official high school transcript or diploma states that you completed the portion of the recommended curriculum that was available, but you were unable to complete the remainder of the curriculum solely because courses necessary to complete it were unavailable to you as a result of course scheduling, lack of enrollment capacity, or another cause not within your control. Admission Pathways There are three pathways to admission for our first-time first-year students who wish to attend The University of Texas at El Paso. Path 1: Top 10% Graduates You are admissible to the University as a first-time, first-year student if you graduated from a Texas high school in the top 10% of your class and you submit all required credentials, including SAT or ACT scores, by the appropriate due date. You must also have either (1) successfully completed the curriculum requirements for the recommended or advanced high school program or its equivalent (described above); (2) satisfied the ACT's College Readiness Benchmarks that apply to you on the ACT assessment; or (3) earned a combined verbal, math, and writing score of at least 1,500 out of 2,400 on the SAT assessment. After admission, you must take the ACCUPLACER to determine first-semester course placement in reading, writing, and mathematics. You must register for these courses with the approval of your advisor. Path 2: High School Rank and Test Scores If you are a Texas high school graduate or a graduate of an out-of-state high school, you are admissible as a first-time, first-year student if you meet any of the criteria listed below: HS Rank in Class Minimum SAT Combined Score (Verbal + Math) Minimum ACT Composite Score Top 25% No minimum, but scores must be submitted No minimum, but scores must be submitted Second 25% 920 19 Third 25 % 970 20 Fourth 25%, 1010 21 No HS rank, GED, unaccredited HS, or home school program 1010 21 After admission, you must take the ACCUPLACER to determine first-semester course placement in reading, writing, and mathematics. You must register for these courses with the approval of your advisor. If you are a Texas resident and do not meet these criteria, you may qualify for provisional admission into the START Program. Our non-residents may qualify through individual review, outlined later in this chapter. Path 3: College Readiness Many of our graduates of public high schools in Texas Educational Service Center Region 19 take the ACCUPLACER placement examination in their junior or senior year as a component of the El Paso Region College Readiness Initiative (CRI). If you took the ACCUPLACER during your junior or senior year and qualified to take UTEP college-level courses in English and mathematics, you will be admitted as a first-time, first-year student once you have submitted all required documents, including SAT or ACT scores. The ACCUPLACER scores required to take college-level courses are: Reading = 78-120 Writing: Essay = 5 + Sentence Skills = 80-120 or Essay = 6-8 College Math = 20-80 Our graduates of private high schools, home schools, public schools outside of Region 19, or those who have a GED may also take the ACCUPLACER to be admitted to UTEP using the College Readiness standard. This may be done locally at UTEP, at El Paso Community College, or at ACCUPLACER test sites around the country. To find an ACCUPLACER test site outside of El Paso, check with college and university testing offices in your area, or call the College Board toll-free at (866) 607-5223. If you do not meet the College Readiness standard, you may qualify through Individual Review, described later in this chapter. START Program If you are a first-time, first-year student who is a resident of Texas, and who does not meet the requirements for admission as stated above, you are eligible for provisional admission through the University's START Program. Our START students enroll in the College of Liberal Arts as START majors. If you are admitted as a START student, you must attend orientation, be advised in the Academic Advising Center, and earn a minimum 2.0 grade point average in at least 9 hours of prescribed University courses. We recommend summer enrollment for our START students. During the first semester at UTEP, you must complete at least 9 semester hours with a minimum grade of \"C\" or \"S\" in each course selected from at least two of the following areas: English, Mathematics, Natural Science, Foreign Language, Social Sciences, or Humanities. A minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must also be maintained. Once these requirements have been met, you will be fully admitted to the University and may change majors. If you do not clear provisional admission during the first semester, but have at least a 1.5 cumulative GPA, an additional START semester will be allowed to clear the admission conditions. If you do not satisfy the conditions of your provisional admission, you have two options if you wish to re-enroll at UTEP: 1. Apply for readmission and reinstatement by the Academic Advising Center after 2 calendar years have elapsed since the end of the last period of attendance; or 2. Apply for readmission to the Office of Admissions and Recruitment after attending another college or university where a minimum of 12 semester hours of college-level work with grades of \"C\" or better in each course were earned and a minimum cumulative 2.0 GPA was maintained. If you experience extenuating circumstances, you may petition for reinstatement through the Academic Advising Center. Testing Requirements for Students Whose High School Language of Instruction Was Not English High school instruction in a language other than English .

If you are admitted on the basis of the PAA, you must enroll as a Programa Interamericano Estudiantil ( PIE ) major in the College of Liberal Arts and enroll in bilingual and ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) courses. Once ESOL 1610 has been completed with a grade of \"C\" or better, students may change majors.

Individual Review If you do not meet the requirements for transfer admission described above, you may seek admission as outlined in the Reviewed Admissions section of this catalog. TRANSFER POLICIES Evaluation of Transfer Credit Once you have been admitted to the University as a transfer student, the Office of Admissions and Recruitment will provide you with a generic evaluation of courses that are transferable to the University. Credits transfer into the University in several ways, including as elective credits. Acceptance of transfer credit by the University does not constitute approval of the credit for use toward a particular degree program. The applicability of transfer courses toward your degree is determined by your academic dean or designate. You should request a degree plan from your academic department or dean's office by the time 60 semester hours have been earned. Transfer credits are awarded according to the following policies: 1. Transfer credit is generally awarded for academic courses completed at regionally accredited or nationally recognized institutions, or from institutions that are candidates for regional accreditation if the credit was earned during the candidacy period. 2. In general, only academic courses that are comparable in content to those offered at UTEP are transferable, and transfer credit carries the same value as work completed at UTEP. Whenever possible, equivalent course numbers are given; if there are no numerical equivalents, elective (TR) credit is given. 3. Only courses with grades of \"A,\" B,\" \"C,\" \"D,\" \"Credit,\" or \"Pass\" are evaluated, and quarter hours are converted to semester hours by multiplying the quarter hours by two-thirds. 4. Courses classified below freshman level by the sending institution are not transferable. 5. Courses from two-year lower division institutions transfer as lower division credit. 6. Undergraduate courses from four-year institutions transfer at the same level (lower-to-lower and upper-to-upper division). 7. Graduate-level coursework is not transferable as undergraduate credit. 8. There is no limit on the total number of hours that can be transferred from other institutions. However, a maximum of 66 semester hours of credit from two-year lower division institutions is applicable toward a degree at UTEP. 9. Grades earned at other institutions are not averaged into the UTEP grade point average. A transfer grade point average is not computed, and only credit hours transfer to the University. 10. Equivalent transfer credit for engineering courses is granted only for work completed at ABET-accredited institutions. 11. Equivalent transfer credit for upper division business courses is granted only for work completed at AACSB-accredited institutions. 12. Completion of the core curriculum, or blocks within the core, at another Texas institution is considered as completion of the core, or appropriate blocks within the core, at UTEP. 13. UTEP does not award university credit for professional certificates or life experience. Resolution of Transfer Disputes If the University refuses to accept lower-division credit earned at another Texas public institution of higher education, you and your previous institution will be given written notice that the transfer credit was denied. If you wish to dispute the non-transfer of credit, the University will attempt to resolve the issue with you and your sending institution according to applicable rules and guidelines of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. If the dispute is not resolved to your satisfaction or to the satisfaction of your sending institution within 45 days of the initial notification, the University will notify the Coordinating Board of the denial of the transfer credit and the reason for the denial. The Coordinating Board will resolve the dispute and notify us of its findings. Questions concerning the evaluation of transfer credit should be referred to the Office of Admissions and Recruitment. UTEP students who have difficulty having UTEP credit accepted at other Texas public institutions should contact the Director of Admissions and Recruitment at UTEP for initiation of the transfer dispute resolution process. Reviewed Admission If you do not meet the requirements for first-year or transfer admission described above or your individual circumstances are highly unusual with respect to your academic credentials, you may apply to be reviewed on an individual basis. This review gives consideration to your high school and college record, the strength of academic preparation, types of courses taken, and grades earned in specific courses. Performance on standardized tests is also considered. You may submit additional material or an essay for consideration in evaluating your potential for success at UTEP. Such material can document, for example, your work experience; achievements, honors and awards; responsibilities while attending school, including child or elder care or other major responsibilities; bilingual proficiency; socioeconomic background; residency status; involvement in community and extra-curricular activities; whether you are a first-generation college student; commitment to a particular field of study; strengths and talents that might not be apparent from the academic record, and experiences in surmounting obstacles in pursuit of higher education. Letters of recommendation from high school teachers, counselors, supervisors, and activity leaders are also appropriate. INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ADMISSION The University welcomes applications from qualified international students whose academic backgrounds indicate a high probability of success in desired academic programs. You must complete high school preparation, or its equivalent, that would qualify you for admission to recognized universities in your home country. Your admission credentials will be evaluated on the basis of the admission requirements described below. If you have attended other colleges or universities, you should also refer to the Transfer Policies section of this catalog for additional information about the transferability of credit. Documents Required. The University must receive complete, official, or school-certified transcripts of high school and university work sent directly from each institution that you attended.

Go Centers are located in local area high schools and staffed by UTEP Students with the assistance of high school counselors. The Centers have information regarding admission to colleges and universities, financial aid, scholarships, and other materials necessary to help foster the idea that higher education is attainable, affordable, and can be achieved. Financial Aid 204 Academic Services Building Phone: (915) 747-5204 Fax: (915) 747-5631 financial@utep.edu www.utep.edu/financialaid DIRECTOR: Raul H. Lerma The Office of Student Financial Aid assists qualified students to meet the costs of college education. No person is excluded from participating on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, veteran status, disability, or sexual orientation. We welcome inquiries by mail, e-mail, telephone and visits. Appropriate forms are available at El Paso area high schools in the counselors' offices and at our office. FINANCIAL AID POLICY The amount and type of financial assistance provided through educational loans, grants, and college work-study follow existing federal, state, and local regulations and policies governing financial aid programs. Priority is given to our undergraduate students with documented need, who meet academic eligibility criteria, who are enrolled on a full-time basis (12 hours or more), and whose applications are received by the priority date of March 15. Financial aid awards are based on financial need and academic merit. To apply, you are required to submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to determine your financial need for the aid period. The cost of attending the University is your student budget. Your financial resources, combined with those of your parents if you depend on them, are called your student/family contribution. Financial assistance for you includes all non-Title IV Scholarships, grants, loans, or other assistance not received under Title IV, for example Veterans Educational Benefits. The difference between your student budget, family contribution, and financial assistance determines your financial need. For a detailed breakdown of direct and indirect educational costs, students should contact the Financial Aid Office for written material. APPLICATION PROCESS March 15 is the application submission priority date for each school year. All forms and required documents are due and must be completely processed by the Office of Student Financial Aid by this date for you to be considered for the maximum aid available. You should be aware that the processing of financial aid documents may take at least four weeks. Late applications will be considered on the basis of available funds. Information that we obtain from your need analysis is used to determine your financial need and the types of awards for which you are qualified. Awards fall into two categories: (1) gift aid, which includes grants and (2) self-help funds, which include the College Work Study Program and long-term educational loans. The amount of aid awareded to you, combined with the student's resources (your student/family contribution), cannot exceed your student budget. Once documented need is established, the Office of Student Financial Aid will make every effort to meet your need. The financial aid award will be packaged from a variety of sources and will be based on the financial need, program eligibility, and availability of funds. In some instances, your total award may be less than your documented need due to fund limitations, program eligibility requirements, or other factors. If you wish to apply for financial assistance for the spring semester, you will be considered based on the availability of funds after we receive your finacial aid documents. You should refer to the Tuition and Fees Emergency Loan section of this catalog for non-need emergency loan fund programs. I If you are subject to Selective Service registration, you are required to file a statement indicating whether you have registered for or are exempt from service registration, in order to be eligible to apply for federal or state financial aid. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS (SAP) CRITERIA The University of Texas at El Paso is mandated to establish minimum standards of \"satisfactory progress\" for our students receiving financial assistance. This requirement applies to your entire academic history, whether financial aid was received or not. It also applies to all types of aid: grants, loans, and work-study. The standards for determining progress include three measurements: grade point average, measurable progress, and accumulated hours, as described below. Grade Point Average Grade point average (GPA) is the quantitative measurement used for academic work at this University. For financial aid purposes, you must maintain at least a 2.0 GPA as an undergraduate student, 2.5 as a candidate for certificate/endorsement, and 3.0 as a graduate student. Measurable Progress Measurable progress is the completion of 75% of attempted hours each academic year. An academic year is defined as two long semesters plus the summer session. Should you attempt to repeat courses to improve your GPA, we caution you that, in some cases, previously earned hours remain on your record but are NOT counted toward total hoursyou attempt to repeat courses to improve your GPA, we caution you that, in some cases, previously earned hours remain on your record but are NOT counted toward total hours earned and therefore could affect their measurable progress. In addition, the following grades do not contribute to credit hours completed: F-Failure N-No Grade P/F-Pass/Fail I-Incomplete P-In Progress Hours Our students receiving aid at UTEP are allowed 170 attempted undergraduate hours to complete a baccalaureate degree. As a Master's candidate, you are allowed 45 attempted and are allowed 80 attempted hours as a Doctoral candidate to complete your degree. Transfer hours, as well as all UTEP hours, are used in determining attempted hours. You are responsible for determining the courses in which you should enroll to comply with this requirement. Special Consideration 1. Non-Degree Seeking - To be considered for financial aid, you must be enrolled in a degree granting program. 2. As a student enrolled in an elementary or secondary teacher certification program required by a state you may only apply for a Stafford Loan. 3. Second Degree Seeking - As a student who is enrolled in a program which leads to a second undergraduate or graduate degree, you are eligible to apply for state grants and a Stafford Loan and is subject to satisfactory progress requirements. 4. Transfer Students - Financial aid eligibility of our transfer students is identical to that of UTEP students with comparable credit hours. All transfer hours accepted by the Admissions Office will be added to UTEP hours whether they are used in the current degree plan or not. 5. Option II/Academic Fresh Start - As a student who chooses Option II or Academic Fresh Start, we caution you that previous semesters in which you received financial aid affect your measurable progress. Appeal Process An appeal process is available to you if you are ineligible for continued aid and may have had extenuating circumstances that prevented your completion of satisfactory progress. If there are grounds for an appeal, you must submit an appeal application, a degree plan if you have completed sixty hours or more, and a typed explanation of the circumstances which brought about the ineligibility and actions that you have taken to remedy the situation, to the Office of Student Financial Aid. An appeal is not available if you have already attempted or will reach150% of the total number of hours required for the degree. All documents are to be presented to a Student Financial Aid Administrator (FAA). If your appeal is denied by the FAA, it may be forwarded to the Financial Aid Internal Review (FAIR) Committee at your request. The committee meets monthly and makes its recommendations to the Director of the Office of Student Financial Aid, who will make the final decision. The appeal decision is made available within a week. If you are planning to appeal, you should be prepared to pay your own registration fees in the event that the appeal is denied or is approved after the deadline for paying registration fees.

Ph.D. The Bachelor of Multidisciplinary Studies (BMS) degree offers you a broad interdisciplinary studies opportunity rather than a traditional specialized major. As an individualized program of study, the BMS emphasizes a broad learning experience and a wider perspective than that provided by traditional undergraduate majors. As a BMS student you will focus on an interdisciplinary theme, period, set of problems, specialization, or perspective not currently available through traditional majors and minors. The BMS degree encourages you to select courses from the entire university course inventory, tailoring your study to your own personal and professional interests and needs. The degree provides you with a fundamental knowledge of skills necessary to competently express yourself, think creatively, solve problems, and understand the nature and function of people and the environment. The interdisciplinary degree plan developed by you and your advisor is reviewed by a program review committee composed of academic faculty and a University College representative. Admissions Requirements As a new, transfer, continuing, or returning student, you may declare your intention to work toward a BMS degree if you meet UTEP's admission requirements. All of our students who are admitted into the BMS program are required to meet regularly with a BMS advisor to select their concentrations and electives. Bachelor of Multidisciplinary Studies Degree Requirements The Bachelor of Multidisciplinary Studies degree requires a minimum of 120 semester hours, including at least 45 hours at the advanced/upper division (junior and senior) level. In addition to completing the 42 semester hour University core curriculum, you will define, in consultation with a BMS advisor, three areas of concentration totaling 45 semester hours, including a minimum of 27 hours of advanced work. Each area of concentration includes 15 hours, 9 hours of which must be advanced. The goal of the concentration is to give you an interdisciplinary foundation that satisfies your individual educational and professional goals while maintaining academic rigor and integrity. The academic areas comprising the concentrations require the approval of the faculty program review committee. Thirty-three hours of electives, 18 of which must be advanced, bring the degree total to a minimum 120 semester hours.

The University of Texas at El Paso | Terms Of Use | Privacy Statement | Required LinksRegister | Login Home Financial Information Academic Regulations Student Services Undergraduate Studies and University College Colleges and Degree Programs Text/HTML College of Engineering Engineers enjoy one satisfaction that not everyone can claim--they can point to tangible evidence of their efforts. Every modern structure, computer, jet aircraft, power-generating plant, or new automobile design is a lasting testimonial to the engineers responsible for it. Thus, to a great extent, our current standard of living and high level of technology are due to the diligent and innovative efforts of engineers. Future accomplishments could help increase energy and food supplies, develop more contamination-free power plants, aid in medical science's fight against disease, and expand our computational and design skills beyond imagination. A noted researcher once summarized the engineer's career satisfaction by pointing out that while scientists \"explore what is,\" engineers \"create what never has been.\" The future for engineering graduates remains very bright. Our rapid pace of technological and industrial developments has established an ever-increasing need for highly talented and qualified professional engineers. In addition, the increasing demand for goods and services has imposed new challenges to present and future engineers. To provide these things and, at the same time, conserve resources and minimize environmental impact, engineers must recognize that solutions to long-standing societal problems are only found by thorough planning and study. With a capacity for problem solving, engineers may be the best-qualified persons to address society's problems. The complexities of today's economy and environment are such that all resources must be used in an optimal manner. Thus, the College of Engineering, through its curricula, strives to educate and train engineers who have the desire to learn and the breadth of vision to formulate and solve the problems of today and tomorrow. It is expected that a student who applies himself or herself and successfully completes one of the engineering or computer science programs will not only be technically prepared but also broadly educated, and thus ready to make a significant contribution. The College offers many programs of study that should be selected on the basis of personal ambitions, interests, and abilities. The student may choose the traditional BS degree and also consider advanced research-oriented graduate programs leading to the MS and PhD degrees. Within the College, the undergraduate programs in civil, electrical, industrial, mechanical, and metallurgical and materials engineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, 111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, Maryland 21202-4012; telephone: (410) 347-7700. The breadth of modern computer technology is covered by BS and MS degrees in Computer Science and a computer engineering concentration in Electrical and Computer Engineering. The program leading to the BS in Computer Science is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, 111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, Maryland 21202-4012; telephone: (410) 347-7700. To recognize outstanding achievement and encourage professional activities, each program has one or more active student sections of the appropriate professional and honor societies. Additionally, there are campus chapters of professional societies that cover all fields of engineering. Participation in these groups provides a valuable educational and professional experience and students are encouraged to participate to the extent of their eligibility. College Vision Statement The Vision of the College of Engineering at the University of Texas at El Paso is to change the face of engineering. College Mission Statement The Mission of the College of Engineering at the University of Texas at El Paso is access to excellence.

The lower-division course block is comprised of English, science, engineering, and mathematics courses listed in the freshman and sophomore years. a. Enrollment in upper-division courses prior to completion of the lower-division requires permission of the student's program head. b. Substitutions of lower-division course requirements require the permission of the student's program head. 2. Completion of the lower-division block also requires a minimum 2.0 GPA for the lower-division courses designated by the program and a \"C\" or better in certain specified courses. 3. Any student who does not satisfy the \"C\" minimum rule in the appropriately designated courses must repeat those courses. 4. Any student who has not met the requirements for satisfactory completion of the lower-division block as stated above or who fails to make satisfactory progress toward a degree will be denied subsequent enrollment in the College of Engineering. Pre-Engineering Program The Entering Students Program for Engineering and Science Circles of Learning for Entering Students (CircLES) Program Description Circles of Learning for Entering Students (CircLES) is a comprehensive retention program targeting first-time freshman and first-time transfer students in the sciences, engineering and mathematics (SEM). The goals of CircLES are to increase retention, improve academic performance, and add value to a student's education through the creation of an environment where students make connections with the university, the colleges, faculty, upper-division students, and their peers. A learning environment is emphasized in the first year where entering students can be successful and begin to develop lifelong learning habits. There are four major foci within the CircLES Program, all coordinated by the Director of the Entering Student Program: 1) a mandatory college-specific orientation program in the summer prior to matriculation; 2) mandatory placement in learning communities (clusters) in the first year; 3) strong developmental advising and early intervention; 4) leadership development. Since its inception, the CircLES program has become recognized as a model on campus and elsewhere for creating a strong foundation for entering students to springboard them toward a successful college and (eventually) professional career. Students wishing to major in engineering or computer science will be classified as pre-engineering students for not less than one semester after admission to the University. Students must fulfill all Pre-Engineering requirements and must: 1. Complete the specified orientation program. 2. Meet with a pre-engineering advisor each semester. 3. Complete an approved program of study that may include one or more of the following courses: UNIV the pre-engineering program, some of these courses do not meet departmental degree requirements. Check with your CircLES advisor. 4. Maintain a minimum overall GPA of 2.0 in all designated courses. 5. Complete certain specified courses with a \"C\" or better. 6. Make satisfactory progress toward completion of the pre-engineering program. Upon completion of the pre-engineering program requirements, students will petition for a change of major into a selected engineering program. Limit on Engineering Course Enrollments The maximum number of times an engineering or computer science course can be taken is three. All enrollments in a course that result in a grade of \"A,\" \"B,\" \"C,\" \"D,\" \"F,\" or \"W\" will be counted. Once a student has reached the maximum of three enrollments, he or she will not be allowed to enroll in the course a fourth time. If the course is required in the student's degree plan, the student will not be able to complete the requirements for that degree. Once a student has obtained a \"C\" or better in an engineering or computer science course, that course may not be repeated for credit. Enrollment in Engineering/Computer Science Courses by Non-Majors Enrollment in nearly all engineering and computer science courses is restricted to students with the appropriate majors. Students from outside the engineering college wishing to take engineering/computer science courses should request permission from the head of the program offering the course. Double Majors Students in the College of Engineering may pursue more than one undergraduate degree. However, all requirements for each degree must be completed before the degree can be awarded. Cooperative Education Cooperative education is a program which integrates a student's formal academic study with special periods of practical work experience in business, industry, government, or professional or service organizations. These work experiences are an integral part of the student's education, supplementing academic knowledge and promoting and encouraging personal development and professional preparation. The academic value of work completed under the cooperative education program is recognized by allowing credit to be earned for completion of three work periods and submission of required reports. Contact the Dean of Engineering for information on the availability of co-op work assignments. Five-Year Bachelor/Master of Science Program The College of Engineering provides an opportunity for qualified students to participate in a five-year bachelor/master of science degree program. The program is structured to allow qualified engineering students to enter a graduate research or design program during the senior year of the bachelor's degree. During this fourth year, the student may reserve certain courses for graduate credit, work actively on a research project for nine months, or be considered for employment as a teaching or research assistant at the appropriate salary. Both the bachelor's and master's degrees can be completed in five academic years. Graduate Study The traditional Master of Science (MS) degree is available in civil engineering, computer engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, industrial engineering, manufacturing engineering, mechanical engineering, and metallurgical and materials engineering. This degree is research-oriented, normally requiring a thesis and up to 27 hours of graduate course work.

Every modern structure, computer, jet aircraft, power-generating plant, or new automobile design is a lasting testimonial to the engineers responsible for it. Thus, to a great extent, our current standard of living and high level of technology are due to the diligent and innovative efforts of engineers. Future accomplishments could help increase energy and food supplies, develop more contamination-free power plants, aid in medical science's fight against disease, and expand our computational and design skills beyond imagination. A noted researcher once summarized the engineer's career satisfaction by pointing out that while scientists \"explore what is,\" engineers \"create what never has been.\" The future for engineering graduates remains very bright. Our rapid pace of technological and industrial developments has established an ever-increasing need for highly talented and qualified professional engineers. In addition, the increasing demand for goods and services has imposed new challenges to present and future engineers. To provide these things and, at the same time, conserve resources and minimize environmental impact, engineers must recognize that solutions to long-standing societal problems are only found by thorough planning and study. With a capacity for problem solving, engineers may be the best-qualified persons to address society's problems. The complexities of today's economy and environment are such that all resources must be used in an optimal manner. Thus, the College of Engineering, through its curricula, strives to educate and train engineers who have the desire to learn and the breadth of vision to formulate and solve the problems of today and tomorrow. It is expected that a student who applies himself or herself and successfully completes one of the engineering or computer science programs will not only be technically prepared but also broadly educated, and thus ready to make a significant contribution. The College offers many programs of study that should be selected on the basis of personal ambitions, interests, and abilities. The student may choose the traditional BS degree and also consider advanced research-oriented graduate programs leading to the MS and PhD degrees. Within the College, the undergraduate programs in civil, electrical, industrial, mechanical, and metallurgical and materials engineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, 111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, Maryland 21202-4012; telephone: (410) 347-7700. The breadth of modern computer technology is covered by BS and MS degrees in Computer Science and a computer engineering concentration in Electrical and Computer Engineering. The program leading to the BS in Computer Science is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, 111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, Maryland 21202-4012; telephone: (410) 347-7700. To recognize outstanding achievement and encourage professional activities, each program has one or more active student sections of the appropriate professional and honor societies. Additionally, there are campus chapters of professional societies that cover all fields of engineering. Participation in these groups provides a valuable educational and professional experience and students are encouraged to participate to the extent of their eligibility. College Vision Statement The Vision of the College of Engineering at the University of Texas at El Paso is to change the face of engineering . College Mission Statement The Mission of the College of Engineering at the University of Texas at El Paso is access to excellence . Mathematics Preparation In addition to the usual preparatory work, applicants to the College of Engineering are expected to have at least two years of algebra, one year of geometry, and one semester of trigonometry or Pre-Calculus in preparation for their freshman year. Transfer Course Work A student may transfer a maximum of 66 semester hours, limited to lower-division courses, from two-year junior or community colleges. A maximum of 100 semester hours of courses is transferable from accredited U.S. colleges and universities. Transfer credit for engineering courses is restricted to ABET-accredited curricula or is awarded on the basis of departmental recommendation. Transfer students may be required to take competency exams and/or take specified courses that the department feels they must have in order to establish the quality of their degree. Credit for upper division engineering courses will be given only on the basis of departmental recommendation. The academic records of all transfer students are reviewed by the College of Engineering to determine eligibility for admission into an engineering program. International students must meet the additional requirement of an overall minimum GPA of 3.0 in mathematics, chemistry, physics, and engineering for all institutions attended. All transfer credit that is to be applied toward undergraduate engineering degree requirements must be approved by the Dean of Engineering. Transfer credit evaluation should be completed when the student transfers to the College or before completion of the lower-division requirements. Change of Major 1. All petitions for change of major to or within the College of Engineering are subject to the approval of the head of the program gaining the student. 2. Any student enrolled in a non-engineering program at the University may change his or her major to a program in the College of Engineering if he or she has demonstrated an aptitude for the engineering or computer science profession and is qualified to enroll for MATH 1411 in his or her first semester of engineering or computer science. 3. Any student enrolled in an engineering program at the University may change his or her major to another program in the College of Engineering if he or she has a minimum overall GPA of 2.0 and earned a minimum GPA of 2.0 in the semester previous to applying for the change of major. 4. All students entering the College of Engineering must follow the catalog (or a later catalog) that is in effect at the time of their transfer. Lower-Division Program1. A student entering the College of Engineering must complete the designated lower-division course block prior to enrolling in the upper-division engineering or computer science sequence or any junior/senior classes. The lower-division course block is comprised of English, science, engineering, and mathematics courses listed in the freshman and sophomore years. a. Enrollment in upper-division courses prior to completion of the lower-division requires permission of the student's program head. b. Substitutions of lower-division course requirements require the permission of the student's program head. 2. Completion of the lower-division block also requires a minimum 2.0 GPA for the lower-division courses designated by the program and a \"C\" or better in certain specified courses. 3. Any student who does not satisfy the \"C\" minimum rule in the appropriately designated courses must repeat those courses. 4. Any student who has not met the requirements for satisfactory completion of the lower-division block as stated above or who fails to make satisfactory progress toward a degree will be denied subsequent enrollment in the College of Engineering. Pre-Engineering Program The Entering Students Program for Engineering and Science Circles of Learning for Entering Students (CircLES) Program Description Circles of Learning for Entering Students (CircLES) is a comprehensive retention program targeting first-time freshman and first-time transfer students in the sciences, engineering and mathematics (SEM). The goals of CircLES are to increase retention, improve academic performance, and add value to a student's education through the creation of an environment where students make connections with the university, the colleges, faculty, upper-division students, and their peers. A learning environment is emphasized in the first year where entering students can be successful and begin to develop lifelong learning habits. There are four major foci within the CircLES Program, all coordinated by the Director of the Entering Student Program: 1) a mandatory college-specific orientation program in the summer prior to matriculation; 2) mandatory placement in learning communities (clusters) in the first year; 3) strong developmental advising and early intervention; 4) leadership development. Since its inception, the CircLES program has become recognized as a model on campus and elsewhere for creating a strong foundation for entering students to springboard them toward a successful college and (eventually) professional career. Students wishing to major in engineering or computer science will be classified as pre-engineering students for not less than one semester after admission to the University. Students must fulfill all Pre-Engineering requirements and must: 1. Complete the specified orientation program. 2. Meet with a pre-engineering advisor each semester. 3. Complete an approved program of study that may include one or more of the following courses: UNIV the pre-engineering program, some of these courses do not meet departmental degree requirements. Check with your CircLES advisor. 4. Maintain a minimum overall GPA of 2.0 in all designated courses. 5. Complete certain specified courses with a \"C\" or better. 6. Make satisfactory progress toward completion of the pre-engineering program. Upon completion of the pre-engineering program requirements, students will petition for a change of major into a selected engineering program. Limit on Engineering Course Enrollments The maximum number of times an engineering or computer science course can be taken is three. All enrollments in a course that result in a grade of \"A,\" \"B,\" \"C,\" \"D,\" \"F,\" or \"W\" will be counted. Once a student has reached the maximum of three enrollments, he or she will not be allowed to enroll in the course a fourth time. If the course is required in the student's degree plan, the student will not be able to complete the requirements for that degree. Once a student has obtained a \"C\" or better in an engineering or computer science course, that course may not be repeated for credit. Enrollment in Engineering/Computer Science Courses by Non-Majors Enrollment in nearly all engineering and computer science courses is restricted to students with the appropriate majors. Students from outside the engineering college wishing to take engineering/computer science courses should request permission from the head of the program offering the course. Double Majors Students in the College of Engineering may pursue more than one undergraduate degree. However, all requirements for each degree must be completed before the degree can be awarded. Cooperative Education Cooperative education is a program which integrates a student's formal academic study with special periods of practical work experience in business, industry, government, or professional or service organizations. These work experiences are an integral part of the student's education, supplementing academic knowledge and promoting and encouraging personal development and professional preparation. The academic value of work completed under the cooperative education program is recognized by allowing credit to be earned for completion of three work periods and submission of required reports. Contact the Dean of Engineering for information on the availability of co-op work assignments. Five-Year Bachelor/Master of Science Program The College of Engineering provides an opportunity for qualified students to participate in a five-year bachelor/master of science degree program. The program is structured to allow qualified engineering students to enter a graduate research or design program during the senior year of the bachelor's degree. During this fourth year, the student may reserve certain courses for graduate credit, work actively on a research project for nine months, or be considered for employment as a teaching or research assistant at the appropriate salary. Both the bachelor's and master's degrees can be completed in five academic years. Graduate Study The traditional Master of Science (MS) degree is available in civil engineering, computer engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, industrial engineering, manufacturing engineering, mechanical engineering, and metallurgical and materials engineering. This degree is research-oriented, normally requiring a thesis and up to 27 hours of graduate course work. The Master of Science in Environmental Engineering (MSEnE) and the Master of Engineering in Environmental Engineering (MEEnE) are also offered. Ph.D. degrees are offered in civil engineering, computer engineering, computer science, materials science and engineering, and environmental science and engineering. Students who rank high in their undergraduate class should give serious consideration to developing their full intellectual potential in engineering by continuing with advanced studies at the graduate level. For those students interested in the practice of professional engineering, the Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) degree should be given serious consideration. The program involves 33 hours of coursework without a thesis. Possible areas of specialization include business management, operations research, computer science, and others. Graduate programs are more fully discussed in the Graduate Catalog. Degree Plans For degree plans, please click here and select your desired major.

Campbell, Room 500 (915) 747-7270 ot@utep.edu CLINICAL ASSISTANT PROFESSOR: Capshaw Occupational Therapy is a dynamic profession and an integral part of modern comprehensive health care. Occupational therapy is the use of purposeful activity or interventions designed to achieve functional outcomes which promote health, prevent injury or disability, and which develop, improve, sustain or restore the highest possible level of independence of any individual who has an injury, illness, cognitive impairment, psychosocial dysfunction, mental illness, developmental or learning disability, physical disability, or other disorder or condition. It includes assessment by means of skilled observation or evaluation through the administration and interpretation of standardized or nonstandardized tests and measurements. Occupational Therapy services are provided in a variety of settings, ranging from medical facilities to community health agencies, schools, and private practice. The Occupational Therapy Program offers a Masters Degree in Occupational Therapy. While acceptance into the Masters Degree Program does not require prior completion of an undergraduate degree, the competitive nature of the admissions process makes it imperative that interested undergraduates follow a traditional undergraduate major (e.g., Health Promotion, Kinesiology, Biology, Psychology, Social Work, Anthropology, etc.) as they complete the program prerequisites and electives. In addition, undergraduates should be aware of the University Core Curriculum and its requirements as they plan a course of study that may lead to consideration for admission to the Masters Degree in Occupational Therapy. Candidates with a Bachelor's degree will be given preference. NOTE: In order to engage in clinical rotations, which are a crucial element in the curriculum, Occupational Therapy students must pass a background check. Therefore, applicants accepted to the Occupational Therapy Masters Degree program will be required to undergo and pass a background check prior to matriculation. Degree Requirements The Bachelor of Science in Occupational Therapy is no longer offered in the United States. Students interested in pursuing a Masters in Occupational Therapy will be designated as Pre-Occupational Therapy (P-OT). Students are encouraged to select a program and complete the degree requirements for a major which is closely aligned to the Occupational Therapy Program (e.g., Health Promotion, Kinesiology, Biology, Psychology, Social Work, Anthropology, etc.). When planning a course of study that may lead to consideration for the Occupational Therapy Program, students must take courses that apply to the University Core Curriculum, meet requirements for a regular academic major, and satisfy specific program prerequisites. University Core Requirements (44 semester credit hours). All courses used to satisfy the core curriculum must be completed with a \"C\" or better.

Physical therapists apply scientific principles to prevent and treat acute and chronic movement disorders. Physical therapy encompasses areas of specialization and includes the development of new approaches to more effectively meet existing and emerging health care needs. Other areas in which physical therapists participate include research, education, and administration. The Physical Therapy Program offers a Masters Degree in Physical Therapy. (The first doctoral class [DPT] is expected to enter in Summer 2009.) Twenty-four students are selected each year and begin their studies in the Fall. Successful completion of the academic and clinical components of the Masters Degree makes the graduate eligible to take the Texas (and other State) licensure examination in Physical Therapy. Successful completion of that examination allows the graduate to practice Physical Therapy. The program with its academic and clinical components is two and one-half calendar years in length (eight consecutive semesters). The semesters are sequential and require full- time attendance. Included in the program are a total of thirty (30) weeks of full-time clinical internships and a research project. NOTE: In order to engage in clinical rotations, which are a crucial element in the curriculum, Physical Therapy students must pass a background check. Therefore, applicants accepted to the Physical Therapy program will be required to undergo and pass a background check prior to matriculation. Applicants will be responsible for the costs in obtaining a background check report. Admissions requirements include an earned bachelor's degree and 49 semester hours of prerequisites. The Required Course List is attached. Note that a minimum overall GPA of 3.0 on four point scale, and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in prerequisite courses are required. In addition, 50 clock hours of volunteer or paid experience in a physical therapy setting is required, and must be supervised by a licensed physical therapist. The Graduate Record Exam (GRE) is also required, and while there is no minimum score required, the score will be considered in the competitive admissions process. All science (biology, chemistry, physics) and math courses must have been completed in the last 10 years. Prerequisite Courses Forty-nine semester hours are required prerequisite courses.

The final selection is competitive and based on academic course work and the other requirements. Admissions Process: There are two deadlines for submission of admission packets each year. To be considered for Fall interviews, all materials must be received by November 1. To be considered for Spring interviews, all materials must received by February 1. Students should apply when they are within 2 semesters of completion of course requirements for admission. Our objective is to fill the class with students who complete all course requirements by the end of the Spring Semester of the year for entrance into our program. Completed applications will be reviewed semiannually in November and February. Interviews for qualified applicants will be scheduled in November and February/March for qualified applicants. Following the November interviews, exceptionally well-qualified students will be immediately accepted to the program. Other qualified applicants will be placed in a \"pool\", will remain in competition for class slots, and will be compared to subsequent applicants in March. The application process will close February 1 for all admissions. Applications remain open for one year (i.e., from date application fee is received by Graduate School).

Campbell, Room 107 (915) 747-7250 scphlang@utep.edu DIRECTOR: Anthony P. Salvatore PROFESSORS EMERITI: The Program in Speech-Language Pathology offers an innovative five-year plan that culminates with the Master of Science Degree. Students who complete the plan fulfill academic course work and clinical practicum requirements for the Texas License, as well as the Certificate of Clinical Competence in Speech-Language Pathology. The plan includes 97 semester credit hours of undergraduate course work and 33 required semester hours, in addition to registering for five semesters of clinical practicum (15 semester hours), all of which may be completed in five years. Undergraduate students selecting this program will be designated as pre-Speech-Language Pathology majors. Students with a BS/BA in Speech Language Pathology from another university are encouraged to apply for admission to the Graduate program. Since the plan of study culminates with the Master of Science Degree, undergraduates should be aware of the following: 1. A GPA minimum of 3.0 in upper-division preparatory SPLP undergraduate courses and acceptable GRE scores on the Verbal, Quantitative and Written section are required for acceptance into the Graduate School. A GPA higher than 3.0 may offset low GRE scores; high GRE scores may enhance consideration. A description of the Master of Science program is in the Graduate Catalog . Admission is competitive. The number of students admitted each year is dependent on available program resources. 2. Undergraduate students must take the GRE and apply to the Graduate School prior to the completion of the prescribed 97 undergraduate hours. 3. Students whose grades in SPLP courses do not appear to demonstrate the potential for success in Graduate School should discuss the advisability of continuing in the Speech- Language Pathology Program with their advisor prior to beginning the third year. 4. In order to engage in clinical rotations, which are a crucial element in the curriculum, Speech Language Pathology students must pass a background check. Therefore, applicants accepted to the Master of Science in Speech Language Pathology program will be required to undergo and pass a background check prior to matriculation. Degree Requirements The Bachelor of Science in Speech Language Pathology is not offered. Students interested in pursuing a Master of Science in Speech Language Pathology will be designated as Pre-Speech Language Pathology (PSHL). Students with a BS/BA in Speech Language Pathology from another university are encouraged to apply for admission to the Graduate program. University Core Requirements (44 semester credit hours).

The purpose of professional social work education is to enable students to integrate the knowledge, values, and skills of the social work profession into competent practice. Fully accredited by the Council on Social Work Education, the Social Work Program at UTEP prepares students for beginning professionally supervised practice. Social Work Program Mission The mission of the Social Work Program is derived from UTEP's own statement of purpose, the standards of accreditation of the Council on Social Work Education, and the region served by the University. More specifically, the Social Work Program at UTEP has as its primary mission the training of culturally competent generalist social work practitioners capable of providing an array of social services to the unique bicultural, bi-national populations living within the service areas identified by the University. More specifically, the program seeks to achieve its mission through the fulfillment of the following goals: 1. Providing students with liberal-arts based entry-level generalist knowledge, skills, and values related to professional social work practice with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities from a cultural competence/social justice perspective. 2. Preparing entry-level generalist social workers equipped with knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary for culturally competent professional practice within the bi-national, multicultural context of a borderlands region. 3. Preparing graduates who are able to use knowledge of mechanisms of oppression to empower client systems at any level to promote social justice through achievement of optimal systems' functioning. 4. Preparing entry level generalist social work students with an understanding of the utility and process of scientific inquiry as a basis for evidence-based practice, including the evaluation of programs and individual practice. 5. Preparing BSW students for graduate education in social work. 6. Producing high quality professional BSW graduates able to meet the needs of human service agencies of a borderlands region. Bachelor of Social Work Degree Professional social work advisement allows for early and periodic evaluation of each student's performance and guides students in selecting areas of course work. Professional academic advising is therefore essential for all students (pre-professional, transfer, and admitted) to ensure that course work complies with the current BSW degree plan. Professional academic advising for social work and pre-social work majors may be done only by UTEP social work faculty. The BSW degree plan is designed to assure coverage of CSWE accreditation mandated curriculum content. This degree plan is based on the building block analogy of Social Work education. The freshman year is considered the liberal arts year. The sophomore year is the pre-professional year. The junior year is the foundation professional year. The senior year is the advanced professional year. Students shall be considered pre-professionals if they have completed at least 30 hours in the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum and have officially declared Social Work as their major. Social Work classes are sequentially offered and include content on values, ethics, diversity, social and economic justice, populations at risk, human behavior and the social environment, social welfare policy and services, social work practice, research, and field practicum. The Social Work program places a strong value on community involvement and students begin early in their course of study to gain practical experience through volunteer hours in approved agencies. In the foundation professional (junior) year, a pre-internship experience of 60 hours is incorporated into SOWK 3355 Introduction to Generalist Practice I. BSW Admissions Policy All students who wish to graduate from the BSW Degree Program at UTEP must apply for a separate admission into the Program and gain either clear or conditional acceptance. This acceptance is granted through the Social Work Program office. Only students who have been admitted into the BSW Degree Program and have completed all degree plan requirements in both the liberal arts core and the social work major will be recommended for graduation with a BSW degree. All UTEP students who completed course work before the program was accredited in June 1995 and transfer students should review the Policy on Certification of Coursework to ensure that social work courses comply with the requirements of the current BSW degree plan. While a criminal background check is not required for admission to or completion of the program, student internships associated with this program may require students to complete a criminal background check prior to work at an agency.

Rivera CLINICAL Anaya, Loya, Salcido, Sias COORDINATORS: Ho, Reilly, Rudder The University of Texas at Austin College of Pharmacy, in cooperation with The University of Texas at El Paso, offers a six-year curriculum leading to the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree. This program offers a course of study in the pharmaceutical and clinical sciences designed to provide the community with pharmacists who are scientifically trained and clinically competent to deliver a full spectrum of pharmaceutical services in all areas of practice. The Pharm.D. degree is designed to prepare men and women whose abilities and career aspirations suggest significant potential for innovative leadership in professional practice. In addition, this degree will prepare students to practice pharmacy in a contemporary setting, whether in a community or hospital pharmacy, in a long-term care facility, or in the pharmaceutical industry. This objective is met through a balanced program of study in pharmaceutics, pharmaceutical and natural products chemistry, pharmacology, therapeutics, pharmacy administration, natural and social sciences, and the humanities, as well as a structured clinical and professional practice experience program. In addition, the curriculum is aimed at inculcating an understanding of the basic sciences sufficient to prepare the student for graduate study in the pharmaceutical sciences. The Cooperative Pharmacy Program is designed to facilitate access to the College of Pharmacy at Austin by providing opportunities to fulfill pre-pharmacy requirements in El Paso. The Pharmacy Scholars Program (PSP), which is an integral part of the Cooperative Pharmacy Program, provides highly qualified high school seniors conditional admission to The University of Texas College of Pharmacy and supplements the usual application process for admission to UT College of Pharmacy. A select number of students will be chosen to enroll in the program each year. These undergraduates will select the pre-pharmacy major and are encouraged to take advantage of the diversity and many opportunities at UTEP. Students selected for this program attend UTEP for approximately two years to complete their pre-pharmacy curriculum (e.g., organic chemistry, calculus, and physics) and, after obtaining required criteria, will move to Austin to attend the College of Pharmacy for approximately two years. The final approximately two years of the six-year curriculum will be completed in El Paso, and successful candidates will receive their degree from The University of Texas at Austin College of Pharmacy, in cooperation with the Cooperative Pharmacy Program at UTEP.

Martin, McGee Deutsch, Staudt ASSOCIATE PROFESSORS: Best, Dailey, Rodr\u00edguez, Weaver ASSISTANT PROFESSORS: Martin STUDENT ADVISOR: J.D. Marquez ARTIST-IN-RESIDENCE: Robert Snead The African American Studies Program provides for individuals of all backgrounds a humanistic lens and course of study for analysis of the Black experience. Research, teaching, and related academic and social activities focus on African American history and culture and attendant complexities of \"race\" relations in Texas, the American southwest, the nation, and the Diaspora. The program's curriculum centers on the African American experience as it relates primarily to past, present, and future issues of (1) economic and business development; (2) leadership and service; (3) changing family structures and values; (4) gender politics; (5) the rapidly changing world of science and technology; and the importance of these issues in the local and global consciousness and behavior of African Americans and others of African descent. Students explore these issues using the interdisciplinary approach, comparative methodology, and computer literacy to acquire the critical thinking skills and knowledge for leadership, involvement in community development, preparation for graduate school, and to meet the personal and professional challenges of the 21st century. Individuals minoring in African American Studies and mastering the subject matter acquire empowering knowledge and self-awareness with respect to race and ethnicity. They are equipped intellectually to become better citizens in their towns, cities, nations, and global communities based on their understanding and problem solving abilities when faced with the damaging and debilitating manifestations of bigotry, segregation, and other discordant \"isms.\" Those seeking employment as teachers, ministers, engineers, scientists, musicians, athletes, aviators, scholars, public servants, social workers, filmmakers, and military personnel will find the African American Studies Program an excellent complement to their major course of study. To earn a minor in African American Studies, students are required to complete the following core courses: AFST 2300 Introduction to African American Studies AFST 2301 Theories in African American Studies AFST 3390 Topics in African American Studies With the permission of the director of the African American Studies Program and the chair of the relevant department, the student may substitute an independent study course for \"Topics in African American Studies.\" If the option is selected, the student is strongly encouraged to do an independent study course in some aspect of local, regional, state, national, or global history impacting on the past or present lives of African Americans or their endeavors to envision new societal changes or improvements. The final three courses for completion of the minor may be selected from the vast variety of General Courses that are listed below, provided that at least six hours are at the upper-division (3300-4300) level. The student is urged, however, to select at least one course that will combine both the major and minor fields of study to address a pertinent and pressing praxis problem in the history of African Americans or those of African descent; their interactions with other groups (Asians, Native Americans, Hispanics, or Anglos); or a national or global aspect of contemporary \"race\" relations issues. The student may also earn three credits by designing a practicum course that permits him or her to do field work in the community, nation, or a foreign country using cognitive skills, comparative methodologies, or theoretical perspectives acquired while minoring in African American Studies.

We emphasize the rigorous study of literature alongside the acquisition of skills in the writing of fiction, poetry, essays, plays, screenplays and literary translation. As such, our degree plan strikes a balance between theory and practice, between critical and imaginative thinking. As students progress in their degree plan, they are free to place emphasis on or specialize in the study and writing of a specific genre. Another feature of our undergraduate degree is the possibility for qualified students to write a creative honors thesis.

Canfield Courses offered by this department are designed to offer qualified students an opportunity to become a commissioned Army officer. The curriculum provides opportunities for leadership training and experience that are not duplicated in other college courses. Instruction encourages the development of resource management skills, self-assurance, confidence, personal discipline, executive abilities, personal responsibility, professional ethics, physical stamina, bearing, and other fundamental qualities required of an Army officer. These same qualities will enhance any civilian career. The first two years (MS I and MS II) comprise the Basic Course which offers an introduction to Military and Confidence Building Skills, First Aid and Survival Skills, Land Navigation, and Leadership Assessment and Managerial Skills. Basic Courses are normally taken during the freshman and sophomore years without any military obligation. The last two years (MS III and MS IV) constitute the Advanced Course and are normally taken during the student's junior and senior years. All MS courses require a non-credit Leadership Lab. Additionally, Advanced Course students are required to satisfactorily complete selected courses in Written Communication, Human Behavior, Computer Literacy, Math Reasoning, and Military History prior to commissioning. Eligibility Basic Course Enrollment in the Basic Course is open to all students at any academic level. Credit for all or part of the Basic Course may be granted by the Professor of Military Science (PMS) for participation in high school ROTC or for active military service of four or more months. This is done on a case-by-case basis. Two-Year Program Students who did not enroll in the Basic Course, or who cannot be given credit for the Basic Course by virtue of active military service or participation in Junior ROTC (high school), may qualify for the Advanced Course by attending a four-week summer training course (Leaders' Training Course, located at Fort Knox, Kentucky). Applicants for the camp should visit the Department of Military Science no later than May 1 st to obtain application forms and schedule a physical examination. Students must have a minimum of four semesters remaining prior to completion of a baccalaureate or advanced degree. Advanced Course Admission requires approval of the PMS based on medical fitness, an acceptable degree plan, a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher, and military qualification under one of the following plans: 1. Prior military service 2. Completion of the Basic Course requiring MS 1101, 1103, 2202, and 2204 3. Completion of Leaders' Training Course at Fort Knox, Kentucky 4.

Interested high school seniors should obtain application requests from their counselors and submit the request by January 1st. Application forms are also available at the Military Science Department. Students majoring in nursing may apply for dedicated nursing scholarships. Three-Year Scholarships The Professor of Military Science awards these scholarships to college freshmen. Freshmen, including those not enrolled in Military Science, may apply through the Military Science Department. Applications may be submitted from mid-November through mid-April. Nursing students may apply for a three-year dedicated nursing scholarship. Two-Year Scholarships The Professor of Military Science awards these scholarships to college sophomores. Sophomores who have not been in ROTC must attend Summer Camp at Fort Knox, Kentucky where they will receive the \"hands on\" foundation of the basic ROTC course. Applications may be submitted from mid-November through the end of May. Pay and AllowancesPay and Allowances All students enrolled in Army ROTC are furnished uniforms, textbooks, and equipment on a loan basis. All advanced course cadets are paid $450 per month during the Junior year and $500 during the Senior year, for a maximum of ten months, excluding the five-week Advanced Leadership Course. The U.S. Government pays the tuition, required fees, textbooks, and essential classroom supplies for Army ROTC scholarship students. Additionally, four-year and three-year ROTC scholarship recipients are paid $300-350 per month during the fall and spring semesters of their freshman and sophomore years. Additional Programs Qualified cadets may attend Airborne School, Air Assault School, Cadet Field Training, Drill Cadet Leader Training, Mounted Maneuver Training, Army Science Board, Northern Welfare Cadet Orientation, Combat Survival Training, United Officer Training, and ROTC nurse summer training. Additionally, Advanced Course cadets may attend Cadet Troop Leadership Training (CTLT), serving a two to three-week tour with an active Army unit upon completion of the National Advanced Leadership Camp. Commissions Offered Upon successful completion of all Military Science studies and requirements for a baccalaureate degree, a cadet is awarded a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army or Army Reserve/National Guard and may be required to serve on active duty not to exceed three years (four years for ROTC scholarship students). Since UTEP offers a general Military Science curriculum, a commission in most branches of the Army is possible. Following graduation, newly commissioned officers are sent to an Officer Basic Course (OBC) to qualify for a specific branch, and then complete a tour of active duty through a variety of challenging assignments.

The program offers both: 1) interdisciplinary courses studying a range of issues that cross disciplines and 2) courses which deal with the impact of gender within individual disciplines, such as History, Political Science, and Sociology, to name a few. While the Women's Studies Program was created in 1981, UTEP has offered individual courses in Women's Studies since the early 1970's. The program's primary goal is to foster gender equality in scholarship, the workplace, and in society as a whole. Women's Studies courses offer students a rigorous education in theories of women's oppression, diverse gender roles and sexual identities, the history of gender relations, contemporary economic and social policies affecting women and men, and the creative work of women in the United States, Mexico, and around the globe. Women's Studies courses also demonstrate that knowledge is created both in and outside of the University; therefore, many courses integrate the knowledge and experience of community activists, community organizations, and women in the El Paso/Ju\u00e1rez region. A minor in Women's Studies complements any major at the University and will prepare students for a wide range of careers. Whether a student plans to be a lawyer, a journalist, business executive, social worker, educator, or political official, women's studies courses can help students learn about the specific challenges women face and develop solutions to gender inequity. If a student plans to attend graduate school, the minor in Women's Studies will prepare her or him for advanced study as a Women's Studies scholar.

All lower- division courses in the major must be completed with a \"C\" or better. Minor: Specific disciplines may require a minor. Those disciplines that require a minor have requirements with respect to total hours and how many of these must be in upper division hours. Some disciplines prescribe courses that fulfill the minor requirements, whereas others allow wide latitude in the courses selected. Students should check the selections of the catalog dealing with minor fields for their major as well as their minor department. All lower-division courses in the minor must be completed with a \"C\" or better. Each degree plan specifies acceptable minors and College of Science minors are listed by each department. Secondary teacher certification requires a minor in secondary education. Elective Courses: In addition to the above requirements, elective courses of general interest or relevance to the major field of the student as needed to complete the required 120 semester hours credit and the minimum 37 upper-division semester hours of credit are required. Students should consult with their advisor in selecting electives that will be appropriate for their career path. Courses in which the material is repetitive of, or included within, courses required by the Department or College may not be applied as elective credit toward the BS degree. Major Fields The College of Science offers BS degrees in the following disciplines: Applied Mathematics, Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Earth Science, Geological Sciences, Geophysics, Mathematics, Microbiology, Physics, and Psychology. The specific requirements for these disciplines and various options may be found in the academic department sections of this catalog (Psychology is listed under the College of Liberal Arts). In addition, BS degrees are offered in the following interdisciplinary areas: Environmental Science, and Interdisciplinary Studies. Students planning to obtain a degree in the College of Science must major in one of the above fields. Students planning to enter medical or dental schools normally obtain a BS or BA degree in science and, for this reason, should declare a major field (pre-medical and pre-dental are not major fields). Double Majors A student who fulfills requirements for two majors prescribed by academic departments in the College of Science (or any other college) may earn a degree with a double major. Double majors in a single department are not allowed. Double majors must satisfactorily complete all course work required of the major in each department/college. A course of study requiring more than 120 semester credit hours may well result from seeking a double major; students should seek advice from their principal advisor before beginning. Second Baccalaureate Degrees Students who have earned a baccalaureate degree at an accredited institution may be eligible to enroll as candidates for a second baccalaureate degree in the College of Science. This degree will be awarded upon satisfactory completion of all Bachelor of Science degree requirements in the College of Science. Students seeking a second baccalaureate degree must complete at least 24 semester hours, specified by the department, following the award of the first baccalaureate degree. Students may petition the Dean of Science to reserve up to 9 semester hours taken during the last semester of the initial degree work for credit toward the second BS degree. Students may not obtain a second baccalaureate degree in the same academic department as the first degree. Pre-Science Program Circles of Learning for Entering Students (CircLES) The Entering Students Program for Engineering and Science Engineering Bldg., Room E-229 Phone: (915) 747-6083 Fax: (915) 747-8878 Program Description Circles of Learning for Entering Students (CircLES) is a comprehensive retention program targeting first-time freshman and first-time transfer students in the sciences, engineering and mathematics (SEM). The goals of CircLES are to increase retention, improve academic performance, and add value to a student's education through the creation of an environment where students make connections with the university, the colleges, faculty, upper-division students, and their peers. A learning environment is emphasized in the first year where entering students can be successful and begin to develop lifelong learning habits. There are four major foci within the CircLES Program, all coordinated by the Director of the Entering Student Program. Areas of focus include: 1) a mandatory college-specific orientation program in the summer prior to matriculation; 2) mandatory placement in learning communities (clusters) in the first year; 3) strong developmental advising and early intervention; 4) leadership development. Since its inception, the CircLES program has become recognized as a model on campus and elsewhere for creating a strong foundation for entering students to springboard them toward a successful college and (eventually) professional career. Vision The CircLES Program wants to be a recognized model for creating a strong foundation for entering students to springboard them toward a successful college and professional career. Mission Statement The CircLES Program is dedicated to: 1) providing pre-engineering and pre-science students with the skills and knowledge to become successful college students; 2) developing leadership skills and self-awareness in entering and other students to foster their success; and 3) connecting entering students to the university, the Colleges of Engineering and Science faculty, and each other. Educational Objectives for the CircLES Program 1. To provide pre-engineering and pre-science students with the motivation, skills and knowledge to become successful college students and to become successful engineering and science students. 2. To introduce pre-engineering and pre-science students to team building and group dynamic skills. 3. To begin developing leadership skills in pre-engineering and pre-science students. 4. To increase the awareness of pre-engineering and pre-science students of the opportunities available to engineering and science graduates.4. To increase the awareness of pre-engineering and pre-science students of the opportunities available to engineering and science graduates. Students wishing to major in science will be classified as pre-science students for not less than one semester after admission to the University. Students must fulfill all pre- science requirements and must: 1. Complete the specified orientation program. 2. Meet with a pre-science advisor each semester. 3. Complete an approved program of study that may include one or more of the following courses: UNIV the pre-science program, some of these courses do not meet departmental degree requirements. Check with your CircLES advisor. 4. Maintain a minimum overall GPA of 2.0 in all designated courses. 5. Complete certain specified courses with a \"C\" or better. 6. Make satisfactory progress toward completion of the pre-science Program. Upon completion of the pre-science program requirements, students will petition for a change of major into a selected science department. Advising All students enrolled in the College of Science must be advised prior to registration. Students should follow the directions for obtaining academic advice outlined in the Class Schedule under the Advising: College of Science section. Although the Department of Psychology may not require advising, it is strongly recommended that students seeking the BS in psychology obtain degree plan advice from the Office of the Dean of Science. In particular, these students are advised not to postpone the required courses in mathematics. Students planning a career in Clinical Laboratory Science, Nursing, Physical Therapy, Pharmacy, or other allied health fields are referred to the College of Health Sciences section of this catalog and should be advised in that College. Pre-professional Advice The Office of the Dean of Science sponsors a Medical Professions Institute, which houses the Preprofessional Advisor. Students should work closely with this advisor if they are interested in entering medical, dental, veterinary or physician assistant schools. These professions normally require a baccalaureate degree. No particular major is required for entrance, although a minimum of two years of biology, two years of chemistry (including a year of organic chemistry), a semester of calculus, and one year of physics are required for admission to most health professional schools. Thus, a major in Chemistry, Biological Sciences, Microbiology, or Physics might be appropriate. Secondary Teacher Certification (8-12) The College of Science encourages students to consider teaching in the secondary schools as a career goal. The College realizes that better prepared mathematics and science teachers will result in better prepared freshmen enrolled at UTEP. Certification for teaching in the secondary schools is available in the following BS degree fields: Mathematics Certification, Mathematics/Physics Certification, Science 8-12 (formerly known as Composite Certification) (Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science, or Interdisciplinary Studies), Life Science Certification (Biological Sciences or Interdisciplinary Studies), Physical Science Certification (Chemistry or Interdisciplinary Studies). All majors leading to high school teacher certification require a minor in secondary education. Science 8-12 Certification where the major is in Biological Sciences, Chemistry, or Environmental Science includes a minor in Secondary Education and 19-20 additional hours in science. Science 8-12 Certification where the major is Interdisciplinary Studies requires 58 hours in the sciences. Physical Science Certification where the major is in Chemistry requires 11 additional hours in physics. Physical Science Certification where the major is Interdisciplinary Studies requires 52 hours in chemistry and physics courses. Life Science Certification where the major is Biological Sciences requires 20 additional hours in science. Life Science Certification where the major is Interdisciplinary Studies requires 56 hours of science. Mathematics Certification requires 46 hours in mathematics and an additional 8 hours in science. Mathematics/Physics Certification requires 43 hours in mathematics and 14 hours in physics. Students planning to teach mathematics may also obtain certification with a BA degree Mathematics (offered by the College of Liberal Arts). In addition, those who already hold a baccalaureate degree in mathematics or a science may obtain a post-baccalaureate or alternative secondary teacher certification in the College of Education. Students should refer to the College of Education section of this catalog for details on these programs. Students of mathematics and sciences considering teaching should inform themselves on these options and decide which is best for them. Minors in Secondary Education Secondary certification requires a minor in Secondary Education. Secondary Education minors for BS degrees in Mathematics or Science consist of 21 semester hours. The following courses are required for the minor: EDPC 3300 Developmental Variations RED 3342 Reading and Study in the Content Areas SCED 3311 Curriculum Planning in the Secondary School SCED 3317 Multicultural Education in the Secondary School SCED 4691 Student Teaching in the Secondary School. The minor for Mathematics students includes: SCED 4367 Teaching Math in Secondary School The minor for Science students includes: SCED 4368 Teaching Science in Secondary School Admission to Secondary Teacher Education The College of Education secondary education professional development program may be started prior to admission to teacher education. However, in order to enroll in three of the courses, including the internship, a student must be admitted to secondary teacher education, which requires the following: 1. Credit for ENGL 1311, ENGL 1312, and COMM 1301 with a grade of \"C\" or better 2. Credit for MATH 1508 or higher with a grade of \"C\" or better 3. Completion of a minimum of 60 hours of college courses with a minimum overall GPA of 2.5 and minimum major GPA of 2.5. Application for admission to the program is completed with the Secondary Education Advisor in the College of Science and filed in the College of Education Student Services Office, Education Room 412. Additional requirements may be found in the College of Education section of this catalog. Secondary Teacher Preparation Programs Students preparing to teach are advised to carefully plan their course work to allow for the completion of their major coursework before the Internship Semester. The Internship Semester consists of SCED 4691 and SCED 3317. Students are interns in secondary schools for 4 and one-half days a week and take SCED 3317 during the remaining one-half day. Because students are in the schools everyday, it is almost impossible to complete upper-division majors courses during this semester.

Minors Outside the College of Science Approved College of Science minors of Biology, Chemistry, Geology, Mathematics, and Physics are detailed in the academic department sections of this catalog. These minors are approved minors for the BS in Psychology. In addition to these minors, the following minors outside the College of Science are approved for the listed BS degrees: Accounting (BS in Applied Mathematics and Mathematics) Students should refer to the College of Business Administration section of this catalog. Anthropology (BS in Biological Sciences and Geological Sciences) Students should refer to the Department of Sociology and Anthropology, College of Liberal Arts section of this catalog. Computer Science (BS in Applied Mathematics, Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Geological Sciences, Mathematics, and Psychology) Students should refer to the Department of Computer Science, College of Engineering section of this catalog. Economics (BS in Applied Mathematics and Mathematics) Students should refer to the College of Business Administration section of this catalog. Environmental Science (BS in 4384, or MICR 3328-MICR 3128. (The additional the major of minor, cannot include BIOL 1305-BIOL 1106.) General Business (BS in Mathematics) Students should refer to the College of Business Administration section of this catalog. Management (BS in Mathematics) Students should refer to the College of Business Administration section of this catalog. Psychology (BS in Biological Sciences) Students should refer to the Department of Psychology, College of Liberal Arts section of this catalog. (PSYC 1303 is waived if STAT 2380, STAT 2182, and STAT 2381 are completed with a \"C\" or better.) Secondary Education/Mathematics (BS in Mathematics) Students should refer above. Secondary Education/Science (BS in Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Environmental Science, Mathematical Science) Students should refer above. Degree Plans Degree plans are the major tools by which students, their advisors, their departments, and the College of Science track academic progress. Generalized degree plans are available on-line at the College of Science website. However, any student who has completed 60 credit hours and is calculus-ready is required to file for an individualized degree plan that is specific to their personal academic history. The degree plan also lists the outstanding requirements for graduation, and must be obtained from the Office of the Dean of the College of Science (Dean of the College of Liberal Arts for the BA degree). A copy of the degree plan will also be filed with the student's major department. The degree plan must be updated following the completion of 90 credit hours. Each student is required to obtain confirmation of their standing from the Office of the Dean of the College of Science prior to registering for the semester in which all course work for a degree will be completed. The academic dean (Science, Liberal Arts) is therefore the final gatekeeper for determining if all requirements for a degree have been met and the student may proceed to graduate. Lower-Division Courses The prerequisite structure in science programs requires careful attention to course sequences. These courses should be completed before the student reaches Junior standing (60 semester credit hours). These and all freshman courses specified as required for the degree must be completed before Senior standing (90 semester credit hours) in order to count toward the minimum hours required for the degree. Enrollment in MATH 1411 or equivalent is required in order to declare a major. It is to the student's advantage to continue enrolling in the other required mathematics courses since success in these courses largely depends upon what was learned in the previous course and delaying enrollment in higher level courses often requires considerable review. Required Lower-Division Courses in the Major and Minor should be completed with a grade of \"C\" or better before enrollment in upper-division courses. These lower-division courses are listed below. Other lower-division College of Science courses required for the various degree plans are included in brackets. These courses should also be completed with a \"C\" or better before enrolling in upper-division courses if the discipline is the minor. Applied Mathematics MATH 1411, MATH 1312, MATH 1411, MATH 1312 (or STAT 2380 - STAT 1182, STAT 2381)] Chemistry CHEM 1305 - CHEM 1105, CHEM 1306 - 1106, 1411, 1312 (or 1411, MATH - 1182, STAT 2381)] Upper-Division Courses A minimum of 37 semester hours of upper-division course work is required. The various majors have different requirements for upper-division course work in the major and minor. See those respective sections. Upper-division courses are not often offered each semester and summer. Students are cautioned to plan ahead in terms of when these courses are generally offered and what prerequisites are needed.

Secondary Education Concentration : Biological sciences majors wishing to achieve secondary education certification as they complete the B.S. degree must minor in Secondary Education and follow certification tracks for either Science or Life Science for grades 8-12. The major and minor requirements for these tracks are the same, but the additional science requirements are different for the Science versus Life Science certification. Adequate scores on State-administered examinations after completion of all coursework are also required for teacher certification. Major (a minimum of 38 semester hours including 22 semester hours of upper division course work): BOT 2410, MICR 2440, ZOOL 2406, or be selected from BIOL 3427, BIOL 4198, BIOL 4225, or from any of the menu courses listed above. Minor The minor in secondary education requires the following courses: EDPC 3300 (Requires Admittance College of Education catalog for information concerning the admittance to the Teacher Education Program. Additional Science : Certification is offered in two areas, Science 8-12 and Life Science 8-12. Science 8-12 (21 semester hours): CHEM 1305 are required, plus one additional semester hour in either Chemistry, Geological Sciences, or Physics. Life Science 8-12 (21 semester hours): CHEM 1305 - CHEM 1105, 1403, are required, plus one additional semester hour. BS in Microbiology The requirement for the BS degree in Microbiology consists of the general College of Science requirements plus the following specific requirements: Major (a minimum of 42 semester hours including 30 semester hours of upper-division course (19 semester hours of Chemistry course work including 11 semester hours of upper-division course work): CHEM 1305 - CHEM 1105, CHEM 1306 CHEM 1106, CHEM 3324 - CHEM 3124, CHEM 3325 - CHEM 3125, and CHEM 4330 or CHEM 4332 are required. Under exceptional circumstances, other acceptable minors are (18 semester hours, including at least 6 semester hours of upper-division course work) in Computer Science, Geological Sciences, Mathematics, Physics, and Psychology. Additional Science: The additional science is restricted to PHYS highly recommended. BA in Biological Sciences Students should refer to the College of Liberal Arts section of this catalog for the general requirements for the BA degree. The major requirements are the same as for the BS in Biological Science. The minor requirements follow the requirements of the College of Liberal Arts. Biology as a Minor Field for Other Majors A minor in biology requires BIOL 1305-BIOL 1107, BIOL 1306-BIOL 1108, and an additional minimum of 10 semester hours, including at least 6 (9 for a BA degree) upper- division hours of organized courses in the Department of Biological Sciences. Because of the breadth of biology as an academic discipline, no single suite of such electives is identified as appropriate for a general minor. Student selection of these 10 semester hours should therefore be guided by their major advisor and home department policies. Advising/Placement Biological Sciences and Microbiology majors are required to consult with and have their enrollment approved by a departmental advisor. This advising takes place prior to registration in each semester, ideally as soon as the Schedule of Classes for that term becomes available. An entering freshman with at least one year of high school biology may take an advanced placement examination given by the Student Assessment and Testing Office covering BIOL 1305 and BIOL 1306 (but not BIOL 1107 and 1108, which still must be taken). It is recommended that students taking the placement examination have an SAT combined score of at least 1000. Departmental Honors in Biological Sciences Any UTEP student having at least 90 hours of undergraduate credit, and a GPA of at least 3.3 in either in Biological Sciences or Microbiology, and an overall GPA of at least 3.3, may apply for admission to the program. The Departmental Honors Committee retains the right to accept or not accept a qualified student, taking into consideration the number of applicants, the number of available faculty, and the competence of the individual student. The main requirements for Departmental Honors in Biological Sciences or Microbiology will be the satisfactory completion of an Honors Thesis based upon research in Biological Sciences or Microbiology, maintenance of an overall 3.3 GPA or better until graduation, and the presentation of a seminar on the thesis topic. The student will register for two semesters of BIOL 4398, and the research will be carried out under the direction of a member of the faculty in Biological Sciences. The satisfactory completion of the Honors Thesis will be judged by the thesis-research director and the Departmental Honors Committee. Departmental Honors may be awarded with or without other currently awarded honors. Pre-professional Advice Information about entrance requirements to professional schools may be obtained from the Pre-professional Advisor in the Office of the Dean of Science. Students should seek this advice by the time they have completed 60 hours of credit toward a degree. A degree in the Department of Biological Sciences provides excellent preparation for postgraduate study in a number of professions related to biology. While a degree in the Biological Sciences is not required for admission to professional schools and postgraduate programs, the following academic backgrounds are strongly recommended: 1. Medicine, Dentistry, or Veterinary Medicine - A minimum of one year of biology, two years of chemistry including one year of organic chemistry, one year of physics, and one semester of calculus are required for admission to most professional schools. A BS in Microbiology or Biological Sciences (Biomedical Track option) provides an excellent overall preparation for these careers. 2. Physical Therapy - The Pre-professional curriculum includes one year each of biology, chemistry, physics, and psychology; and one semester each of physiology, statistics, and technical writing. Students are strongly recommended to follow the requirements for a BS in Microbiology or Biological Sciences (Biomedical Track option) until they are admitted to the professional program. Specific requirements for the UTEP physical therapy program may be found in the Graduate Catalog . 3. Fisheries, Wildlife, Forest, and Range Sciences - The BS in Biological Sciences (Ecology/Evolutionary Biology Track option) is strongly recommended as the best preparation for careers in these fields.

In 1976, the School of Nursing became an integral part of The University of Texas at El Paso and was organized as a College of Nursing. In 1979 the Allied Health Program was transferred to the College and shortly thereafter, the name was changed to the College of Nursing and Allied Health. In 1999, the college was renamed the College of Health Sciences with two separate Schools, one for Nursing and another for Allied Health. On September 1, 2006, Nursing again became its own independent unit and is now known as The University of Texas at El Paso School of Nursing. The School of Nursing is located approximately one mile from the main UTEP campus, at 1101 North Campbell Street, and is housed in a large, modern building which includes classrooms, laboratories, faculty offices, and lounges for both students and faculty. The School of Nursing provides undergraduate nursing programs leading to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree (Traditional 4 year BSN; RN to BSN Option and Fast Track accelerated program for students with a previous degree) as well as the graduate program culminating in the Master of Science in Nursing degree.

An individual who practices nursing illegally may jeopardize his/her future as a licensed professional. A student employed in an agency has the responsibility, personally and professionally, to engage in only those activities which fall within the job description for non-professional workers, and has a responsibility to refuse to participate in activities which he or she has not been legally licensed to perform. Nursing Student Organization All enrolled students are eligible for membership in the Nursing Student Organization, an affiliate of the Texas Nursing Students' Association and the National Student Nurses' Association. The UTEP Chapter has goals consistent with those of the National Student Nurses' Association. Its purpose is to aid in the development of the individual student, the profession of Nursing and the delivery of health care. Sigma Theta Tau Delta Kappa Chapter of Sigma Theta Tau was chartered at The University of Texas at El Paso in 1980. The purposes of Sigma Theta Tau are to recognize the achievement of scholarship of superior quality, to recognize the development of leadership qualities, to foster high professional standards, to encourage creative work, and to strengthen commitment on the part of individuals to the ideals and purposes of the profession of nursing. Each year invitations to membership are extended to selected students in either the undergraduate or graduate programs who are within the upper one-third of their graduating class and who have a minimum 3.00 GPA. Financial Aid Students enrolled in the School of Nursing are eligible to apply for all forms of financial assistance available to other majors. Specific information can be obtained from the Financial Aid Office at http://academics .utep.edu/Default.aspx?alias=academics.utep.edu/finaid. Armed Services The United States Armed Services view the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) as an exceptionally valuable source for officers who have an appreciation of nursing's contribution to the defense of the nation. ROTC offers programs whereby nursing students may earn a commission while they complete their nursing curriculum. Scholarships that provide for tuition, books, and supplies are available. Monthly stipends are offered to advanced students. In addition to financial assistance, ROTC offers leadership/management courses which are valuable assets in a nursing career.

Note: The Student Health Center (SHC) is the only repository for health clearance information. Clearances must be valid through the entire semester for which the student is registering and must be on file 10-14 days PRIOR to the start of the semester.(See Compliance Web Page for deadline dates). Students who are newly admitted and are to register for the first time should take documentation of the health items directly to the Student Health Center . The SHC will create a file for them so that they may have permission to register and pay fees. No other services may be provided until the student has paid appropriate SHC fees at the time of registration. 2. Clinical Clearance: The following items are required to be turned into the Compliance Office in the Student Support Center. Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) certification is required and must be current as indicated by the certifying body. The certification is required and must be current until the end of the semester for which the student is registering. It must be American Heart Association Healthcare Provider or its recognized equivalent. Students must submit a copy of both sides of the CPR card . If the CPR expires during a semester, students must renew immediately to avoid being dropped from clinical courses. Professional liability insurance must be purchased annually during Fall registration. Students beginning in the Spring or Summer semesters must purchase prorated liability insurance. All upper division students enrolling in nursing courses will be required to show evidence of professional liability insurance coverage of at least a minimum amount of $1,000,000 limit each claim and $3,000,000 limit aggregate.

Multiple hours of preparation are required beyond the classroom periods and clinical experiences. Students must be willing to accept this as a condition of succeeding in the program. Course Repeat Policy Repeating a nursing course due to failure or withdrawal is not automatic. The student must request permission from Undergraduate Nursing Administration to repeat a course by using the designated form found at https://academics.utep.edu/Portals/297/Repeat%20 course%20form.doc. The decision to give permission to retake is based on the following: 1. Space availability 2. Nursing GPA 3. Previous failures 4. Previous withdrawals 5. Course faculty recommendation (which takes into consideration attendance, following remediation plans within the course, etc.) Progression Students must successfully complete all prerequisite courses to progress through the curriculum sequence. Repeating a course disrupts the normal timeline of progression. Successful completion of a failed course does not guarantee automatic progression into succeeding courses . Students who vary from the normal timeline are placed in subsequent courses on a space available basis each semester. Course Withdrawal and Failure In accordance with University policy, a Nursing course may only be attempted twice. A withdrawal from a course that results in a \"W\" counts as an attempt. Students are not encouraged to withdraw from nursing courses as this impedes progress in the completion of the degree plan, but if a student chooses to withdraw from a course, this should be in writing (See Student Handbook). A School of Nursing student may repeat or withdraw from a nursing course only once. Recommendation of the faculty, the student's written request, space availability and approval by the Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Education are needed to retake courses. Failure to successfully complete a Nursing course in two attempts results in dismissal from the School of Nursing. In addition to the two attempt limit, any two failing grades in the Nursing curriculum and/or a faculty recommendation to not allow a student to repeat a course results in dismissal from the School of Nursing. Safe and Effective Nursing Practice Policy All nursing students must perform within the limits of safe practice. A faculty member may drop a student from a course with an \"F\" (regardless of grades received) if the student's nursing practice is deemed to be unsafe as defined in the Safe Practice Policy of the School of Nursing, a copy is posted on the Official Bulletin Board in the School of Nursing. Retention/ Conferences Retention in the major is taken seriously. A retention action plan (RAP) is in place in the SON. Faculty and/or students may initiate the process. A retention action plan will help determine areas of difficulty and recommendations for the student to apply to improve potential success. Students are advised to discuss academic progress and/or situations first with the immediate faculty member, then with the faculty member with overall responsibility for the specific course (the course manager). Faculty members are available to confer with students outside of class according to posted office hours. The Director of the School of Nursing and the Undergraduate Program Director are prepared to confer with students as needed. Student Support staff are also available for referrals to appropriate UTEP student services. Graduation Requirements 1. To be eligible for graduation, a student must have attained a minimum 2.0 Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) in the baccalaureate degree plan and a minimum Grade Point Average (GPA) of 2.0 in the Nursing Major. 2. A candidate must successfully complete the prescribed curriculum and must meet all other requirements of the University, College, and School. Testing Program In order to assist faculty with academic advisement of students, and to provide a means of ongoing evaluation of the School of Nursing curriculum, nursing students are required to participate in a testing and evaluation program in addition to course examinations. Students are required to successfully complete the RN Assessment Examination as part of the NURS 4612 course requirements (see NURS 4612 syllabus for further details). Licensure as a Professional Nurse Graduates seeking licensure must successfully complete the National Council of State Boards of Nursing-Registered Nurse Examination (NCLEX-RN) which is administered by the Board of Nurse Examiners (BNE) for the State of Texas. BSN graduates must complete the BSN licensure application which includes criminal background check information. The SON Director will verify the eligibility status of applicants. All students are required to read and sign the Licensure Eligibility Notification Form prior to being admitted into the clinical courses. (Usually completed during the 4 th semester). Students who have a reason to believe that they may be ineligible for licensure may petition the Board of Nurse Examiners for a Declaratory Order as to eligibility. The Declaratory Order Request form can be downloaded from the BNE web site. The website to review current rules and regulations is: www.bne.state.tx.us.

As an individualized program of study, the BMS emphasizes a broad learning experience and a wider perspective than that provided by traditional undergraduate majors. Students focus on an interdisciplinary theme, period, set of problems, specialization, or perspective not currently available through traditional majors and minors. The BMS degree encourages students to select courses from the entire university course inventory, tailoring their study to their own personal and professional interests and needs. The degree provides students with a fundamental knowledge of skills necessary to competently express themselves, think creatively, solve problems, and understand the nature and function of people and the environment. The interdisciplinary degree plans developed by students and their advisors are reviewed by a program review committee composed of academic faculty and a University College representative. Admissions Requirements New, transfer, and returning students may declare their intention to work toward a BMS degree if they meet UTEP's admission requirements. All students admitted into the BMS program are required to meet regularly with a BMS advisor to select their concentrations and electives. Bachelor of Multidisciplinary Studies Degree Requirements The Bachelor of Multidisciplinary Studies degree requires a minimum of 120 semester hours, including at least 45 hours at the advanced/upper division (junior and senior) level. In addition to completing the 42 semester hour University core curriculum, each student defines, in consultation with a BMS advisor, three areas of concentration totaling 45 semester hours, including a minimum of 27 hours of advanced work. Each area of concentration includes 15 hours, 9 hours of which must be advanced. The goal of the concentration is to give students an interdisciplinary foundation that satisfies individual educational and professional goals while maintaining academic rigor and integrity. The academic areas comprising the concentrations require the approval of the faculty program review committee. Thirty-three hours of electives, 18 of which must be advanced, bring the degree total to a minimum 120 semester hours.

This involvement combines academic classroom-based activities with practical and/or research experience.

To provide additional support for entering students, University Studies also coordinates learning communities. UNIVERSITY COURSES University 1301 and University 2350 are courses taught by faculty and staff from various departments across campus. University 1301: Seminar in Critical Inquiry is a discipline- based, theme-driven course designed to engage students in the University community. Enrollment in University 1301 is restricted to students with fewer than thirty hours of earned credit the semester in which they are taking the course. University 2350: Interdisciplinary Technology and Society is designed to engage students in a critical examination of technology and its effects. Entering students must take either University 1301 or University 2350 to satisfy Block IX of the Core Curriculum. By successfully completing either of these courses, students gain credit toward graduation. The course descriptions identify the innovative nature of the two courses. University Courses (UNIV) 1301 Seminar in Critical Inquiry This course will engage entering students in critical inquiry concerning one or more related academic topics. The seminar will increase students' knowledge of the role of technology in the academic community. Information acquisition, critical thinking, and communication will be integrated in an active learning environment. Students will conduct library and electronic research to support one or more academic projects. Specific topics may vary with instructor. 2350 Interdisciplinary Technology and Society Students in this course will be introduced to approaches to technology assessment and will examine social, cultural, and environmental consequences of technology. The course will include problem solving in small groups assigned to research, analyze, discuss, and arrive at possible solutions for a broad range of topics related to technology and society. Specific topics may vary with instructor. Strategies for effective uses of electronic technology in support of research are emphasized. Prerequisite: ENGL 1312 or ENGL 1313 or ESOL 1312. UNIVERSITY LEARNING COMMUNITIES University Studies also coordinates learning communities for entering students. Learning communities connect students through linked courses. Students enrolled in learning communities attend two, three, or more courses together; for example, a \"community\" of students might be enrolled together in an English and a history class. Sharing courses in this way increases students' opportunities to make friends, form study groups, work closely with faculty, and connect ideas across courses. Look in the class schedule for a list of learning communities offered each semester. The University of Texas at El Paso | Terms Of Use | Privacy Statement | Required Links "}
