State legislatures that remove non- medical exemptions do so with the hope o f increasing vaccination rates. However, there are serious concerns about this knee- jerk legislative reaction. Removing non- medical exemptions can l ead to anti-vaccination sentiment and interference with parental autonomy. This article argues that instead of removing non- medical exemptions, states should implement evidence -based public health solutions in order t o increas e vaccination rates. One examp le of an evidence -based solution is the Community Guide, a resource that contains reviews by a Task Force on a wide array of health interventions. Policymakers should consult these health interventions in order to understand what programs have been scienti fically proven to be effective. In order to successfully implement health interventions, policymakers should follow the framework suggested in this article. First, it is important to determine the target population. The two target populations explored incl ude clustered and low -income communities, as they are the most common to have lower vaccination rates. The type of intervention policymakers choose to implement will take into consideration the resources available and the characteri stics of the target population. The article focuses on three Task Force recommendations: vaccination programs, client reminder and recall systems, and client or family incentive rewards. Each implementation is analyzed as applied to the two target populations to demonstrate these implementations are more effective than legislative action. SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 294 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 10 :293 I. INTRODUCTION On January 5, 2015, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) was informed of a potential measles outbreak; an unvaccinated eleven -year-old child contracted the disease while visiting the Disneyland theme park.1 Two days later, seven California residents had contracted measles, all of which attributed their exposure period to time spent in the park.2 Between December 28, 2014 and February 8, 2015, CDPH identified 125 Uni ted States (U.S.) residents as having contracted measles.3 All of these cases were connected to the Disneyland outbreak.4 One hundred and ten of these people were from California, and thirty -five percent of them had been exposed after visiting the Disney t heme park during this time period.5 As the outbreak progressed, fifteen other cases related to the Disneyland theme park exposure were reported in seven other states, specifically those bordering California, including Arizona and Oregon.6 Out of the 110 Ca lifornia residents who were confirmed with measles, forty -nine people were unvaccinated, several others had only initial doses of some vaccines, and forty -seven people had unknown or undocumented vaccination status.7 Twenty -eight people were unvaccinated due to personal belief exemptions, eighteen of which were children.8 The California measles outbreak is representative of a broader trend currently plaguing the United States. Fewer people are getting vaccinated, which has led to an increase in disease outbreaks across the country.9 Health care officials indicate in the last decade, vaccine- preventable diseases have re- emerged due to lower vaccination rates, despite significant evidence supporting their effectiveness. 10 By 2000, the United States nearly eradi cated the existence of measles through the use of the vaccination.11 However, during the January 4, 2015 through April 2, 2015 research period, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) noted 159 measles cases in U.S. 1.

Based on data compiled by the CDC between 2006 and 2011 , the percentage of people who received non -medical exemptions (NMEs) has practically doubled.17 Nearly all of the recent increased rates of vaccination exemptions are attributable to parents requesting NMEs for their children, which include religious, philosophical, and personal belief exemptions.18 Subsequent to the highly publicized Disneyland measles outbreak in 2015, the California legislature had a knee -jerk reaction \u2014it responded by officially removing both the religious and personal belief exemptions.19 California law now mandates that before a child can be admitted into any elementary or secondary school or day care center, the child must satisfy the immunization requirements, unless he or she receives a medical exemption.20 One of the reasons the state legislature passed the new bill was the fact that the \"rates of 12.

State legislatures that remove exemptions with fortitude believe it is a \"legislative victory\" because it protects the population's herd immunity against vaccine -preventable diseases.24 The main argument behind removing NMEs comes from evidence that when states allow children to receive philosophical exemptions, they not only have higher exemption rates, but also higher rates of disease illness outbreaks.25 Other states observed the responses by state legislatures in Mississippi, West Virginia, and now California and have begun to consider the benefits of stricter policies or allowing only medical exemptions. Immediately following the California legislature's elimination of NMEs, the Vermont legislature also removed its philosophical exemption in the hopes new legislation would result in increased vaccination rates. 26 Additionally, other states like Texas and Washington have proposed legislation and held hearings in order to tighte n their state vaccination laws.27 State legislatures that have removed NMEs believe legislative action is a defensible decision. Health officials in both Mississippi and West Virginia report, \"overwhelming majorities of the public support their policies and that opposition comes [only] from a very small number of people who are extremely vocal and persistent.\"28 The health care profession also supports the elimination of NMEs because non- vaccinated persons unnecessarily increase risks to the community due to the fact vaccines can potentially prevent illness outbreaks in the first place. 29 Close relationships between health care officials, 21.

Some public health representatives strongly support NMEs because they act as a \"safety valve,\" permitting people who strongly oppose vaccinations to legally avoid government compulsion. 32 Enforcing compulsory vaccination could imaginably \"erode trust in vaccines and public health more generally.\"33 Another persuasive argument against removing NMEs is that the choice to receive an exemption is politically popular across the nation.34 Some Americans believe parents should have more weight than the government in decis ions involving the health and wellness of their children. Adamant defenders of NMEs ultimately contend parental autonomy outweighs the public health consequences resulting from exemptions motivated by personal beliefs.35 Parents feel their individual judgme nts about how to take care of their own children should be at the forefront, and the most proactive method of affirming their parental rights is through obtaining exemptions. 36 From a legal standpoint, NMEs help strike a balance between respect for parental autonomy, the health and well -being of children, and governmental mandates that encourage public health.37 Parents have become incredibly concerned about vaccine safety, which is playing a significant role in their vaccine refusal or delay.38 Prevailing concerns involve the belief that vaccines can harm children or the misconception that there is a causal relationship between vaccines and 30.

[with too many shots].\"41 While removing the NME option and compelling parents to vaccinate their children would naturally reduce the rates of exemption and vaccine -preventable diseases, it could create serious political animos ity. In the wake of a highly publicized measles outbreak, California's decision to legislatively eliminate NMEs is not necessary in order to improve state childhood vaccination rates. There are effective strategies that have been statistically proven to su ccessfully eliminate low vaccination rates and protect herd immunity. 42 States need not wait for reactive legislative efforts motivated by dramatic events that generate public support to increase state vaccination rates. Additionally, states need not risk s parking public backlash challenging the lack of exemptions for reasons such as parental autonomy in their children's health care decisions. Swift revocation of a legal right \"that people have previously enjoyed presents a different set of political circums tances than maintaining a status quo in which the right has never existed.\" 43 Instead, state policymakers can take smaller administrative actions that are proven effective and are likely to be long lasting from the evidence -based systematic review of the Co mmunity Guide Task Force (Task Force) . Section II explains important background information about the significance of NMEs, and some data reflecting state -by-state comparisons of vaccination rates to identify whether states with stricter laws always result in higher vaccination rates. It also describes a policy approach called evidence- based public health and a review board called the Community Guide, which will be two important mechanisms in implementing successful vaccination policies. Section III then enumerates a framework for adopting new policy implementations. The necessary steps before implementation first require locating problematic communities that are refusing or failing to vaccinate their children, then tailoring the implementation to meet their needs. To be most successful, the implementation should focus specifically on these target populations. This section subsequently describes in detail some of the different 39.

II. NON-MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE COMMUNITY GUIDE \"Childhood vaccinations are one of the most significant public health interventions of all time\" because vaccinations \"reduce the risk of contracting dangerous vaccine -preventable childhood diseases on the individual level and, when immunization coverage is high enough, confer herd immunity at the population level for those diseases that are contagious.\" 44 Despite the importance of vaccinations, the United States, interestingly, does not have a federally mandated vaccination requirement. 45 In order to incentivize people to vaccinate their children, state legislatures implement vaccination r equirements within the educational system.46 All fifty states require parents to provide documentation of immunization for admission into school and day care, a mandate crucial to achieving widespread vaccination. 47 State vaccination requirements mandate that all children are vaccinated before entering school, but they allow for children with medical contraindications to obtain an exemption.48 Some states also permit NMEs for religious reasons or philosophical beliefs.49 Medical exemptions are permissible, for example, for children with \"compromised immune systems, prior adverse reactions following vaccination, allergies to vaccine components, and certain types of moderate or severe illness.\"50 Children who obtain medical exemptions are protected from the dangers of illness due to the \"unlikelihood that they will be exposed to the disease.\"51 However, a more common use of an exemption by parents is the religious exemption, or a choice 44.

Mississippi and West Virginia have the most restrictive laws regarding NMEs but, surprisingly, are not the states with the highest vaccination rates in ever y vaccine category.55 A Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) indicated Mississippi led the nation with the highest vaccination rates with regard to MMR and varicella vaccinations, but not all vaccinations. 56 West Virginia was below the average U.S. percentage in all categories but one.57 This is noteworthy because it would be expected that Mississippi and West Virginia would have the highest rates across the board because of their lack of NMEs. Furthermore, a 2015 CDC report indicated Maine had some of the highest vaccination rates in different categories of both vaccination types and series.58 This data is significant because Maine allows for NMEs, and the exemption process seems to be fairly easy to fulfill. Maine vaccination laws do not require a sep arate exemption application for each vaccine, parental notarization, or affidavit in the exemption process, and the application does not first have to be approved by the health department.59 Another example of a state that has stricter laws associated with lower vaccination rates is Wyoming, which 52.

Contrary to initial belief, states with the highest exemption rates are not always the states with the lowest vaccination rates. 61 Conversely, low exemption rates (particularly in states with stricter laws) do not automatically result in high percentages of vaccinated children within the state.62 Another confounding factor is \"exemption status does not always reflect vaccination status.\"63 A child who qualifies for an exemption might actua lly have received at least some vaccines.64 Additionally, a child may be fully vaccinated, but parents or guardians may have found it easier to obtain an exemption rather than submitting their child's vaccination information.65 The vaccination and exemption status described in the MMWR reflects a \"child's status at the time of assessment or at an earlier point in the school year\", so it is possible a child could later receive the rest of the required vaccines, but his or her status may not reflect the update.66 Another issue complicating state vaccination percentages is that there can be concentrated pockets of communities with high exemption rates despite overall high state -level vaccination coverage\u2014later discussed as clustering .67 The overall state coverage m ay meet vaccination goals, but there are geographic pockets with unvaccinated children that fall below the average percentage of vaccinated children statewide.68 However, 60.

The current anti -vaccination sentiment in America co uld, in part, be due to the fact that vaccine -preventable diseases have essentially become eradicated; people of this generation have not been exposed to the serious consequences of acquiring such diseases. Younger generations of people have not seen a baby with chicken pox or rubella; \"[t]hey have never heard a baby gasping for air during a spell of whooping cough, or watched a child lapse into convulsions due to brain swelling as a complication of measles.\" 87 Lack of experience and understanding of the consequences of such diseases has resulted in fewer parents feeling compelled to vaccinate their children.88 The answer to increasing vaccination rates in the United States is not by eliminating NMEs, but instead to incentivize vaccination and improve attitude s towards vaccines in general. There are limited resources, especially finite finances and political capital; therefore, policymakers should do what has been proven to be successful. Otherwise, their efforts will only be successful short -term. Considerable weight should be given to the best scientific evidence available as policymakers and health care professionals are \"implementing [new] programs, developing policies, and evaluating progress\" of programs and policies. 89 Policy should follow the evidentiary trends because the data reveals what works. III. THE FRAMEWORK & POLICY IMPLEMENTATIONS This c omment argues for following a framework when applying the Community Guide recommendations in target populations. The framework for implementing new policies to increase vaccination rates must first begin with identifying the characteristics of the target population. Policymakers should initially determine what level they are interested in implementing the policy. For instance, policymakers may desire to address i ssues at the state level, county level, or an individual school district. To assure the implementation adequately meets the needs of the population, the next element is to understand why this certain community is failing to reach adequate immunization leve ls. A phenomenon called clustering could be influencing the elevated numbers of exemption rates in certain geographic locations. Clustering is a phenomenon in which a \"proportion of people who seek exemption to mandatory vaccination is higher in a particul ar locality than it is for the broader 87.

The people within clusters typically file NMEs for two m ain reasons: (1) strong refusal based on fears of vaccination safety or (2) the convenience of filing an exemption so their children can enter school on time.94 Given that vaccine exemptions are clustered within certain sub -populations of the state, it is necessary for policymakers to first determine what types of people are hesitant and where their communities are located.95 The next step is to determine what aspects of vaccinations are causing their concerns.96 Most parental concern is some variation of vaccine safety, whether it is particular to one single vaccine or the effects of vaccines generally.97 For example, a 2012 study in Utah found the top five reasons for personal exemptions were \"(1) issues regarding parental perceptions about vaccine harm. . ., (2) health care systems issues. . ., (3) chronic disease concerns. . ., (4) immune system concerns. . ., [and] (5) adverse reaction concerns.\"98 Ultimately, the reason most parents choose to fulfill an exemption is based on concerns about potential harmful effects for their children, even though there is evidence supporting the value of vaccinations to improving public health.99 The second reason parents obtain NMEs is related to health care system issues.100 This often occurs when parents submit a NME form bec ause it is easier than obtaining the child's vaccination documentation. These parents are concerned about getting their children enrolled in school so they file the NME 90. May & Silverman, supra note 16. 91.

In addition to white, college -educated populations, another targeted population worth considering before implementation of new vaccination policies is low -income communities. His torically, there have been indisputable disparities in childhood vaccination coverage.105 In a MMWR from the 2014- 2015 school year, evidence showed \"[c]hildren from households classified as below the federal poverty level had lower estimated coverage for alm ost all of the vaccinations assessed, compared with children living at or above the [federal] poverty level.\" 106 Vaccination coverage also varies by demographic characteristics. Over the past twenty years, while disparities in vaccination coverage between racially ethnic children and white children have declined, they still exist.107 The August 2015 CDC report found lower vaccination coverage for racially ethnic children compared to white children for several vaccinations.108 The CDC also recommended targeting interventions in areas where there are families and children living below the poverty level.109 Vaccination interventions will not only help eradicate health care disparities between populations, but it will also increase herd immunity protection.110 The CDC sup ports evidence -based strategies as a possible method for success.111 101.

The decision whether or not to implement any of the Task Force recommendations may depend on the characteristics of the target population and any restrictions that may make those problems difficult to overcome.112 Not every single recommendation will be successful in every single population in which it is introduced. The following policy implementations are just a few of those recommended by the Task Force. Each selected implementation will be explained in detail, supported by effectiveness data, and then followed by an explanation of their success in c luster and low -income populations. A. Vaccination Programs in Schools 1. The Community Guide Recommendation One implementation reviewed by the Task Force was vaccination programs in schools and organized child care centers using on- site vaccination deliver y. 113 The studies concluded this intervention was effective at increasing vaccination rates, thus the Task Force recommended implementation.114 School -based vaccination programs have the advantage of widening access to vaccination services and increasing the d emand for treatment.115 To be considered empirically effective at increasing vaccination rates, vaccination programs included at least two of the following: \"(1) immunization and education promotion, (2) assessment and tracking of vaccination status, (3) referral of under -immunized school or child care attendees to vaccination providers, and (4) provision of vaccinations.\"116 In order to reduce costs for the schools and day care centers, vaccination programs are often established by 112.

They are less expensive and more convenient than vaccines provided in other health care settings, making this implementation effectiv e.123 Vaccinating children at school eliminates issues of lost time, cost of transportation, and waiting at the office often associated with visits to primary care providers. These constraints disproportionately affect low -income parents who cannot afford to lose time and money, likely resulting in the reduced coverage in their children. 124 School vaccination programs provide children with the vaccinations they need without forcing parents to adjust their schedules in order to take their children to the doctor.125 Two interests are served: the children get the necessary immunizations, and the parents avoid financial loss. Children spend between eight to ten hours a day at school, so it makes logical sense to \"bring[] the vaccines to where the kids are'\" and minimi ze resources exhausted by parents.126 Cost savings is an additional benefit to this implementation.

Therefore, the school's clinic must be organized and communicative about the vaccination status of each enrolled child. 129 Depending on the location of the school, consent could be difficult to obtain. If the school is located in a clustered community of disgruntled anti - vaccination parents, this implementation may require a more tailored approach to persuade these parents of the importance of vaccinations. The Community Guide identifies recognizable barriers to the vaccination programs, which will be necessary for policymakers to take into consideration when determining if they will use this policy implementation. A potential harm is the possibility that families may begin to rely on the school program as their main source of health care, and children w ill lose contact with their primary health care providers for routine care.130 Additionally, some schools and child care centers lack the necessary resources to implement the programs.131 The components of school vaccination programs have been outlined by the Community Guide recommendations, and the following section applies the effectiveness data to the identified targeted populations. 2. Implementation of Vaccination Programs in the Target Populations Vaccination programs will be successful in both clustered and low -income communities. The underlying advantages of school -based vaccination programs and the reasons the Community Guide found a significant increase in vaccination rates are the convenience and lower cost to parents. 132 These factors are what will mak e vaccination programs highly successful in schools within communities where many of the children and families are below the poverty line and may not be able to afford the costs included in getting vaccinated. Before giving the vaccinations, school health care clinics must obtain consent from parents, which can be challenging in clustered populations with 127. TASK FORCE ON CMTY.

Implementing vaccination programs on -campus c an be costly, so not all schools can realistically support this program in their health 133. See Schlay et al., supra note 120, at 541. 134.

Extramural programs provide resources to schools that either do not have adequate health centers to support a vaccination program or are limited in available r esources.144 Ultimately, extramural programs are successful because they \"increase uptake of vaccines and decrease absenteeism due to noncompliance with vaccine requirements for school entry.\"145 The extramural clinics often engage in a partnership with the sc hools, but allow the schools to make major decisions about implementation since they are responsible for maintaining the programs. 146 The partnership proved incredibly vital to the success of the vaccination rates, emphasizing open, honest communication in a collaborative manner.147 The teamwork approach of bringing together different health care organizations will help increase access to and quality of vaccinations. In conclusion, the roles of school nurses or health care personnel in school - based vaccination programs will help increase parental consent for vaccinations, especially within clustered communities that are hesitant to vaccinate their children. School -based vaccination programs are also advantageous for low -income communities because time and financial concerns weighing against taking children to their health care providers are eliminated by the ease and convenience of only having to drop children off at school where they will be vaccinated. B. Client Reminder and Recall Systems 1. The Community Guide Recommendation Another intervention the Community Guide recommends is client reminder and recall interventions, both alone and in combination with other intervention systems. There is evidence this implementation is effective at increasing childhood vacc ination rates in a variety of populations. 148 The effectiveness data revealed client reminder and recall systems alone increased coverage by almost eight percentage points, and when combined with other activities, coverage increased by about sixteen percentage points.149 Client reminders 144.

The Community Gui de's review found parents were more likely to schedule visits when they received numerous reminders and when their reminders were personalized or signed by the physician.155 Multiple, specific reminders are especially influential since child immunization rates in certain populations continue to be problematic due to parents forgetting or being unable to take their child to get vaccinated.156 One factor behind missed vaccinations is a result of recently developed immunization schedules that can be complex and often require strict, timely injections.157 New additions to routine vaccination schedules may leave parents unaware their child is not fully immunized, but reminders relieve problems related to lack of parental knowledge in order to ensure children are gettin g appropriate vaccinations.158 The advantage of using client reminders and recalls is that notifications can reach a significant amount of people without expending many provider 150.

The Community Guide recommends this policy implementation for all populations;165 however, the next section will explain its influence on clustered and low -income communitie s. 2.

Providers are able to send messages to \"hundreds or thousands of patients with minimal additional costs or personnel time, particularly compared with paper mailings.\"173 It typically costs providers no more than thirty cents per message.174 Health care providers typically absorb the costs of these text messages, which greatly benefit families who are limited in financial resources.175 Ultimately, text messages are one of the most effective methods for local health departments or health care organizations to inform large numbers of families when and where to be vaccinated. 176 A study representative of the Community Guide's findings tested the impact of text message reminders, specifically on childhood immunization rates in the first six months of life, and found even despite other barriers like access to care and concern about potential issues following vaccination, the reminders were critical in achieving increased vaccination rates.177 Another study focused on the use of text messages relating to the MMR vaccine.178 The study revealed the reminders were greatly beneficial for children who were not previously scheduled for their one -year check up. 179 This is worth noting because it \"illustrate[s] a potential target population that may benefit most 168.

While client reminder and recalls could be highly effective in low -income communities, this implementation alone may not be as effective in clustered communities of higher socioeconomic status. This is because the purpose behind reminders and recalls is to provoke parents to get their children vaccinated through repetitive nudges. 187 In clustered communities, parents who would be receiving these reminders and recalls typically hold strong anti - vaccination opinions.188 The reminders and recalls do not focus directly on vaccine education or in -depth communications with parents to make them understand the consequences of failing to vaccinate their children.189 This does not indicate remind ers and recalls will not work in these communities because, in fact, the data proves otherwise; it simply suggests policymakers may want to consider this implementation in combination with another method if introduced 180.

Client or Family Incentive Rewards 1. The Community Guide Recommendation The Task Force recommends using client or family incentive rewards because the evidence shows they are successful means of improving vaccination rates in children.190 The Task Force based its recommendation on a combination of studies from a Community Guide systematic review in 2011 and another study conducted during a research period from 2009 to 2012, which determined the percentage of vaccination increase was close to eight percentage points.191 The use of incentives is based on the notion that parents are more likely to seek vaccinations for their children if they receive rewards in return or if they are penalized for failure to do so.192 Programs typically offer either positive or negative incentives.193 Additionally, the \"[r]ewards may be monetary or non- monetary, and they may be given to [parents] or families in exchange for keeping an appointment, receiving a vaccination, returning for a vaccination series, or producing documentation of vaccination status.\"194 Rewards are typically small in monetary value. Examples of rewards include \"food vouchers, gift cards, lottery prizes, [or] baby products.\"195 The typical gifts that were highly effectiv e included fifty -dollar grocery vouchers, $175.00 in monetary prizes, or ten- dollar gift cards for baby products.196 One study, reviewed in the Community Guide findings, was conducted in a Medicaid managed care group and was targeted specifically towards fam ilies with low socioeconomic status and young children.197 Participants received ten -dollar gift certificates whenever vaccinations were obtained.198 For the MMR vaccination, the study resulted in a seven percent increase in the experimental group that was inc entivized with the reward compared to the control group that 190.

While financial incentives have been successful in promoting the uptake of vaccinations, critics argue incentives have the potential to impede the patient's informed dec ision -making process. 202 However, financial incentives are more ethically responsible if \"the problems addressed are perceived to be serious, other interventions are ineffective, and the necessary behaviors [would otherwise be] particularly difficult to achieve.\" 203 There may also be economic concerns about how viable this intervention program may be for certain populations. The Community Guide conducted an economic review and found the average cost of providing incentives was $372.00 per person per year.204 For some communities, the financial resources involved in effectuating this implementation may be limited, and this may not be a sustainable method. Policymakers should do an in- depth financial assessment to determine if this implementation is possible given c ommunity or state resources. The Community Guide explains the basic process of using rewards to change behavior by both hesitant parents and those who may not see the benefits of vaccination. The next section analyzes the use of incentive rewards in vaccin ation uptake of clustered and low -income communities. 2. Implementation of Incentive Rewards in Target Populations A financial - and resource -based rewards intervention is very effective for low coverage pockets where families need the most assistance in achieving quality health care, and the incentives are tailored to the needs of the population. People with low levels of \"health literacy\" may need a push in the right direction because they often are unable to understand benefits of a 199. Id. at 13 6 tbl.

The level of family \"[i]ncome has the potential to influence the response [rate] of individuals to financial incentives.\"206 A small cash payment, for example, could mean enough to someone with low income that he or she would be willing to get his or her child vaccinated. 207 Amount of income can also be reflected in a parent's willingness \"to incur the costs of responding to financial incentives.\"208 In order to receive the reward, parents exhaust time and transportation costs, which are the biggest constraints on low -income persons.209 To be effective, the value of the reward must outweigh the losses forfeited in obtaining it. Low-income communities tend to rely on Women, Infant, and Children (WIC) services, thus WIC benefits from providers in return for vaccinations would be motivational in low -income communities.210 WIC services have been linked to vaccination uptake since 1996, when the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) implemented WIC service incentives to increase vaccination rates among preschool -aged children. 211 The ACIP and CDC recommend ed, \"s tate and local vaccination and WIC programs collaborate [with incentives] to ensure that young children receive [both vaccination and WIC services.]\" 212 The incentive program required that in order to continue in the WIC program, families had to comply with immunization requirements.213 Many WIC programs use voucher restrictions or monthly voucher pickups for children who are behind on immunizations, which require families to return on-site monthly until the child is up to date on v accinations.214 The WIC 205.

There are also incentives for vaccination in school -implemented vaccination programs. Typical incentives in school programs include extra credit, school supplies, or class coupons in exchange for students who return parental consent forms. 217 These studies found that \"peer incentives\" such as class pizza or ice cream parties for all students who turn in parental consent forms to the program center are also highly effective.218 The school -based programs will be influential in both low -income and clustered communities because chil dren of both socioeconomic statuses would enjoy these incentives. The use of financial rewards to incentivize parents to vaccinate their children has proven successful in increasing vaccination rates because it motivates parents, especially those who other wise may not have been inclined to take their children in to be vaccinated. While financial rewards and incentives have been statistically proven to positively change behavior in low -income communities, the application in clustered communities will need to be adjusted, specifically the type of reward. A twenty -five-dollar lottery ticket likely does not mean the same thing to a family living under the poverty level as it does to a family living comfortably in a suburban, gated community.219 As mentioned previo usly, the clusters of people requesting NMEs tend to be higher in education and socioeconomic status; therefore, if this type of incentive is incorporated in those populations, the rewards would need to appropriately reflect interests of that targeted population to be most effective. The combination of school -based vaccination programs and incentives in clustered communities would result in an increase in vaccination attitudes and uptake. IV. CONCLUSION Public health policy should always be based on evidentiary findings. Due to all of the finite financial and human capital involved in political decisions, policymakers should do what has been scientifically proven to work instead of using an iron- fisted approach of eliminating a privilege many Americans 215.

Parents are responsible for their children's health and want to feel that their beliefs are being taken into consideration when making decisions.220 The methods proven to be successful are rooted in EBPH.221 The Community Guide is the gold standard of EB PH in practice because the members of the Task Force panel are unbiased third party researchers with nothing at stake in the results.222 The Task Force results should be given the highest credence in a state's health care policy decisions instead of purely l egislative action or political agendas. Communities that obtain exemptions due to anti -vaccination beliefs or fear of vaccine safety may be best targeted with communication -based interventions, like school vaccination programs and school programs in combination with either reminders and recalls or client rewards. Educating clinic providers, school staff, and nurses at school vaccination programs about how to conduct these conversations with parents will be monumental. Some parents may need the data broken down into ideas they can understand and then logically come to the conclusion that vaccination is a better decision than a potential outbreak. Fostering communication and dispelling myths associated with vaccination between parents and representatives of vaccination programs will help convince these parents about the necessity of vaccination. In addition to the educational information, a combination of providers sending reminders and recalls and the use of incentives will be a strong, successful approach towards getting parents on board with vaccinating their children since they will concurrently be exposed to the importance of vaccinating their children. Low-income communities, with limited access and resources to quality health care systems, will benefit fr om all policy implementations explored: vaccination programs, reminder and recall systems, and incentive rewards. Due to expenses of vaccination, including travel and time off from work, vaccinating children at school alleviates constraints on parents and, most importantly, gets children vaccinated, preventing the likelihood of serious illness later in life. As for reminders and recalls, cell phones have become widespread in society today, and the efficiency of text messages proves to be the most effective way to get in contact with parents to remind them of upcoming vaccination dates or any missed opportunities. 223 When providers frequently reach out to parents until they schedule an appointment, it will reduce the chances of simply forgetting about when chil dren need certain vaccines; or with notice, parents can plan for necessary transportation.

Most parents in these communities m ust take time off work and organize transportation in order to take their children to vaccination appointments; in other words, the incentive must be worthwhile. Policymakers should use the information provided by the Community Guide once they have determi ned which target populations are problematic, where they are located, and why they have failed to reach appropriate vaccination rates. Each recommendation by the Community Guide is proven successful on its own; thus, if a community has sufficient resources , a combination of programs will be most effective. Ultimately, instead of removing NMEs, making parents question governmental action and encouraging public backlash, states should implement these interventions along with the others recommended by the Task Force to successfully increase childhood vaccination rates.
