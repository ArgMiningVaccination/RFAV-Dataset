Read the [previous installments](https://www.politico.eu/tag/health-2024/). Populism [has entered](https://www.politico.eu/article/europes-populist-contagion-vaccines-infectious-diseases/) the realm of public health, with [nearly half](https://www.politico.eu/article/poll-48-percent-of-europeans-believe-false-claims-on-vaccines/) of Europeans convinced that inoculations can be dangerous to humans. In this installment of Health Care 2024 \u2014 [a series of symposiums](https://www.politico.eu/2019-european-elections/spotlight-health-care-2024/) asking leading experts to weigh in on the health care priorities for the next European Commission \u2014 POLITICO asks: What can be done to counter vaccine skepticism and convince Europeans that vaccines are safe and beneficial? Tackle populism at its roots Jonathan Kennedy is lecturer in global health at Queen Mary University of London. You may like The science is clear: The benefits of vaccines far outweigh the risks. Sadly, however, scientific evidence has little or nothing to do with concerns about vaccine safety. Increasing vaccine hesitancy is one manifestation of a broad surge in anti-establishment anger and suspicion toward elites and experts of all kinds, including doctors and public health authorities. Indeed, the two are closely correlated. Western European countries with the highest levels of support for populist parties, like Greece, Italy and France, have the lowest levels of vaccine confidence. Support for vaccines is strongest in countries like Portugal, where populists are weak. To effectively address vaccine hesitancy, we must address its root causes. The populist surge is in large part a consequence of the breakdown of the post-Second World War social contract. A significant chunk of the population in liberal democracies feels politically disenfranchised and economically marginalized. Reversing this trend will require the construction of fairer and more inclusive societies \u2014 in other words, a new social contract for the 21st century. Since such a fundamental reform is unlikely to happen in the near future, perhaps the only way that skeptics will be convinced of the importance of vaccines is when they are jolted out of their complacency by the inevitable increase in deadly and devastating preventable diseases. Promote the benefits of vaccines European Commissioner for Health Vytenis Andriukaitis is a cardiologist and former health minister of Lithuania. As a medical doctor, I find it unacceptable that in the EU children die from diseases when effective and cost-efficient vaccines are available. This resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases has given our public health community a devastating, yet necessary, wake-up call. At the European Commission, we have been seeking solutions to increase confidence in vaccines. A recent EU-wide survey showed citizens trust the advice of health care professionals, and so in response, we have set up a Coalition for Vaccination to support and empower frontline workers in maintaining this trust. Equally, the upcoming Vaccines Information Portal will provide transparent, objective advice about vaccines, and help convince Europeans that getting immunized is safe and effective. In September we are organizing a Global Vaccination Summit. The objective is to provide a highly visible political endorsement of vaccines and to endorse and promote the benefits of vaccination as an incredibly successful public health measure, one that saves millions of lives every year. I want to make sure that I did everything in my power to make sure that the #VaccinesWork message is heard. Engage skeptics in conversation Lois Privor-Dumm is director of policy, advocacy and communications at the International Vaccine Access Center, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, United States. To tackle vaccine skepticism, we must begin by recognizing that doubts about vaccines are most often rooted in good intentions. We need to be trained to listen before responding and not be judgmental when someone's perceptions don't align with our own. Individuals have different reasons for skepticism and every skeptic does not behave the same way. Understanding the nature of the various concerns and places where they exist is an important first step. This can be done through surveys or by keeping a look out for concerns, delays or refusals of vaccinations. Big data and conversation trends in digital media are another good source of information. Once we've identified our interlocutors, social scientists can help us better understand the underlying concerns and develop strategies to communicate in ways that are compelling to diverse communities. Respectful listening can go a long way. This is time consuming and, for some, difficult \u2014 but it's also essential. A lecture can sometimes cause its recipients to dig in deeper. A real conversation can uncover innovative answers within communities and point to solutions that take into account the underlying concerns of vaccine skeptics. Teach people to identify fake news David Robert Grimes is a cancer researcher, physicist and science writer. We tend to think of the anti-vaccine movement as a relatively recent phenomenon, but opposition to immunization is ideologically driven and has been a problem since the time of Edward Jenner, the British physician who pioneered the first vaccine in the 18th century. The modern incarnation is more pronounced and insidious, and the ability of anti-vaccine campaigners to dominate social media has been a major factor in this. The biggest driver of vaccine hesitancy is exposure to anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. We are collectively dreadful at distinguishing the reputable from the dubious. Anti-vaccine activists implicitly understand this, bombarding the unsuspecting with scaremongering claims. It doesn't matter that these messages are extremely mendacious; their sheer ubiquity alters public perception. In the long term, the solution is to teach people how to differentiate reliable from reprehensible sources. In tandem with this, European health services need to be proactive, providing authoritative information on vaccination and quickly countering disinformation. Vaccines have become a victim of their success. It's imperative we reframe vaccination as a bulwark against disaster, and remind people why it matters. To dispel the phantom dangers put forward by the skeptics, we need to remind people of the very real tragedies that vaccination can prevent. Don't mandate vaccines Rakhee Shah is a pediatric registrar based in London. To counter vaccine skepticism, don't forget what's worked in the past. That includes giving people information needed to weigh up the benefits and risks of immunization, training health professionals to communicate effectively, and enlisting local community organizations, parent groups and religious leaders as advocates. Improving the infrastructure and access to vaccinations for certain marginalized groups such as the Roma in Central European countries is also important. That doesn't mean we should ignore the recent changes to the information landscape. Real-time monitoring of social media can provide early warnings of rising skepticsm, providing opportunities for specialists to intervene earlier. Tech giants can be enlisted to battle fake news. Proponents of vaccines can also take a page from the anti-vax movement and use emotive stories of successful public health interventions to win over vaccine-resistant parents, breaking down online echo chambers. Mandatory vaccination should be avoided. This policy option is rising in prominence with every outbreak of measles in Europe, but evidence for its effectiveness is inconclusive. There is a strong chance it could increase distrust in scientists, health care professionals and the government, and therefore feed anti-vax views. Mandatory vaccines also risk widening health inequalities especially if the unvaccinated children of poorer, less educated populations are prevented from attending school. "}
