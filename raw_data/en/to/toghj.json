This report details the activities of our divisions in clinical care, education, and research. We have an additional annual report to the community, which focuses on the people and facilities of the Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital, as well as some of our patients. Since our last department report, we have continued to experience significant faculty growth, having welcomed 28 new pediatric or affiliated faculty. This growth has allowed us to expand capacity in most of our clinical programs, as well as undertake a number of new initiatives. Our gastroenterology program, for example, has raised the bar for children with inflammatory bowel disease by becoming part of a national consortium, ImproveCareNow. We are the only such center in the state outside of New York City, and are approaching 200 children under care. This has brought a standardized approach to these very complicated children, while allowing us to benchmark our care to top national programs. As another example, the cystic fibrosis program in our pulmonology division was selected by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for its Learning and Leadership Collaborative, a multicenter quality improvement consortium. This has helped to bring additional resources and expertise to the care of these children and their families. Our education programs continue to prepare the next generation of pediatricians and pediatric specialists. We have recently begun to examine innovative ways in which we can provide more direct and relevant continuing education to the practitioners caring for children in our region. One of these will be Project ECHO, a program in coordination with the American Academy of Pediatrics which will allow real-time, teleconferenced, patient-centered education to providers. The report also demonstrates the growth in our research programs, with 147 presentations at scientific meetings and 157 publications in peer-reviewed journals. Several of our investigators have received recognition, including a Fulbright Scholarship for Dr. William Kerr, the Murphy Family Professor of Children's Cancer Research. We always welcome and value your feedback. You can continue to keep up with our programs through our newsletter at: http://www.upstate.edu/gch/education/newsletters.php or through our website: http://www.upstate.edu/gch/ . Thomas R. Welch, MD Stanley A. August Professor and Chair Department of Pediatrics Upstate Medical University Medical Director Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital 2 DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS DEPARTMENT LEADERSHIP We have a group of vice chairs who have primary responsibilities for a variety of functions within the department. This group meets weekly and together acts as a deliberative body to set policy and direction. Each of these individuals is also empowered to make independent decisions within his or her area of responsibility. Although I am always available to speak with referring physicians regarding hospital or department issues, these individuals may also be contacted directly in regard to matters within their respective purviews. Ann Botash, MD (botasha@upstate.edu) is Vice Chair for Educational Affairs , with ultimate responsibility for all aspects of education in the department: undergraduate, graduate, and continuing. The enormous growth in our education services is outlined in the education section of this report. Ann also serves the institution in several educational roles. Ann is a well-known figure in pediatrics nationally. She has received the Advocacy Award from the Ambulatory Pediatrics Association, is past-president of the Helfer Society, and is a child abuse pediatrician. Scott Schurman, MD (schurmas@upstate.edu) continues to serve as our Vice Chair for Clinical Affairs . Scott also directs our highly-regarded and growing program in kidney diseases. In his Vice Chair role, Scott has ultimate responsibility for all inpatient and outpatient activity in the department. He has played an important role in our recent growth in faculty and programs. As we have grown and expanded into new ambulatory areas, Scott has overseen these as medical director. Leonard Weiner, MD (weinerl@upstate.edu) rounds out the department leadership team as Vice Chair for Academic Affairs. A former interim chair of our department, with a national reputation for clinical care and research in infectious diseases, Len is well suited for this role. In addition to responsibility for the department's faculty promotion and tenure process, Len has overall responsibility for our research programs. We have made some steady strides in this area, as indicated by the individual division and section reports. A recent bequest to establish a Pediatric Research Institute will lead to further growth in this important area. The leadership team is supported by Cherlynn Clarry (clarryc@upstate.edu), department office manager, Barbara Delaney (delaneyb@upstate.edu) , assistant to the chair, and Leo Sawyer, business manager. Bonnie Miner, MS, RN, CNS acts as our patient safety officer and is important in coordinating our collaborative safety projects. James Peacock, MS, plays a very important role in the department as Education Program Administrator, especially with residents and medical students.DEPARTMENT REPORT 3 PEDIATRICS BY THE NUMBERS A few pertinent metrics provide a summary of our child health care activity during the period of this review.

Patients are cared for in a 15 bed pediatric ICU (PICU) by a multidisciplinary team led by the intensivist. The team consists of dedicated PICU nursing, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, dietitians, and child life personnel. Surgical patients are co-managed with various surgical teams and include, among others, trauma, cardiothoracic, general surgery, neurosurgery, urology, otolaryngology and orthopedic patients. The PICU has access to a full complement of pediatric sub-specialists. The faculty of the PICU provide technologically advanced care across the full range of ICU therapies. Available therapies include, but are not limited to, invasive and non-invasive ventilation, ECMO, renal-replacement therapy, invasive cardiovascular monitoring, and neurocritical monitoring. The division is also responsible for the management of a regional transport system dedicated to bringing critically ill children (non-trauma) from referral hospitals to Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital. The transport team utilizes specially trained nurses and respiratory therapists for this service. Our specialized pediatric transport team allows us to bring the resources and expertise of our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital to a critically ill child at another hospital. EDUCATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS The division provides a variety of educational programs. The division participates in the education of pediatric residents from the Department of Pediatrics. This activity begins with a yearly series of lectures to the residents and continues at the bedside during the 3 months that residents spend in the PICU during their residency. We have past pediatrics residents successfully training in fellowships for Pediatric Critical Care. The division also provides training for residents from the Emergency Medicine Residency and fellows from the Pediatric Emergency Medicine Fellowship. Both spend time in the PICU as part of their education. 1 Dr. Seidberg also serves as Chief Medical Informatics Officer for Upstate Medical University 2 Dr. Hannan also serves as a member of the Division of Pediatric Rheumatolog y and Integrative Medicine 3 Dr. Sachdeva also serves as Senior Vice President of Strategic Affairs for Upstate Medical UniversityDEPARTMENT REPORT 5 The division provides an advanced class for students at the Upstate Medical University School of Medicine. This \"acting-internship\" allows students to take on many of the responsibilities of pediatric residents. The course exposes the students to a broad range of illness and teaches a physiologically based, developmentally appropriate approach to caring for ill children. Additionally, Dr. Newmyer has been made co-director for the second-year block covering renal, reproductive and endocrinology systems. The division also plays a role in educating nurses and services such as the respiratory therapy. We have begun a program using the simulation lab to provide advanced training to nurses and therapists that function as a part of our transport system. The division also oversees a mock code program to provide ongoing readiness training to residents and staff in the Children's Hospital. DIVISION HIGHLIGHTS The Division of Pediatric Critical Care has expanded and now consists of 7 faculty members. The division continues to look to provide up to date care at the highest levels. To continue this mission, recent initiatives have begun to improve renal-replacement therapy, update ultrasound capabilities and continue to improve the capabilities of our transport system. The critical care transport team medical director is now Dr. Newmyer, who started with our division in July 2015 coming to us from Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Through outreach to referring hospitals, new education initiatives for our team, new equipment, a new data collection and quality initiative, and ongoing work with area ground and air medical transport systems, Dr. Newmyer and the team hope to expand our capabilities to bring the resources of our PICU beyond our walls to those who need it. The Department of Respiratory Therapy has named Dr. Fernandez the Medical Director for Pediatric Respiratory Therapy. Dr. Fernandez will work to enhance the education of pediatric respiratory therapists and will assist with the creation and implementation of new techniques as they become available. Dr. Fahy has an additional expertise in quality improvement and has begun several initiatives both locally and as a part of national PICU quality programs. CLINICAL SNAPSHOT Number of admissions 2015: 680 2016: 682 Types of patients The PICU admissions are equally divided between medical and surgical diagnoses.6 DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS EDUCATION PROGRAM IN GENERAL PEDIATRICS FACULTY Vice Chair for Educational Affairs Ann S.

Peacock, MS , Education Program Administrator Patricia Mondore, MA , Residency Program Coordinator Carol Plumley , Clerkship Assistant, Syracuse Campus Melissa Rowley, Clerkship coordinator, Binghamton Campus OVERVIEW The education faculty represents a variety of pediatric specialists as well as general pediatricians. The team works closely with residents, chief residents, students and other faculty to ensure attention to the educational needs of our learners. Learners include students, residents, faculty and staff. Graduate Medical Education For seventy years, the Department of Pediatrics has maintained a residency training program in general pediatrics that provides residents with a strong foundation in primary care pediatrics, acute care medicine and all subspecialties. Our collegial environment allows a \"hands on\" approach with a low faculty to resident ratio. Due to the large catchment area served by the department, residents directly care for patients with a vast array of medical problems. Residents are actively involved in varied learning experiences such as resident run journal clubs, research and pathophysiology conferences, case-based ambulatory care and subspecialty conferences, daily rounds with faculty, weekly grand rounds, DEPARTMENT REPORT 7 and regular discourse with visiting professors. Our curriculum has prepared residents for fellowship training in subspecialties and careers in primary care pediatrics across the country. The residency program has a full five-year accreditation from the ACGME with no citations. The residency curriculum: The curriculum enables residents to become competent in all areas of general pediatrics. In addition, we offer 4 Career Focused Pathways as choices for residents, allowing them to choose unique experiences for electives that will prepare each resident for their future careers. These pathways are chosen by the end of the intern year and include: International/Underserved Pathway Primary Care Pathway Subspecialty/Fellowship Pathway Critical Care/Hospitalist Pathway Some highlights of the curriculum in general pediatrics include: Seminars - The core curriculum for residents offers an innovative approach to learning. The faculty translated the core curriculum to an on-line environment that is available to the residents anytime and anywhere. The material is contained within Blackboard and resident participation in the online curriculum is monitored. Residents participate in a case based series of seminars for a blended learning experience, including online and in-person. The sessions reinforce and complement the on-line lectures and offer a relevant approach to learning through cases. Residents complete quiz materials online that can be used for preparation for the board examination. Primary care - Primary care training is based at the University Pediatric and Adolescent Center (UPAC). Residents also have the option of participating in a longitudinal outpatient clinical experience at the Onondaga Nation Clinic during their third year and may choose the Primary Care Pathway to enhance this experience. Community Health Center - A 3 year funded grant through Doctor's Across New York to provide clinical learning experiences at the local community health center was completed in June 2016. Residents that have taken advantage of this experience have gone on to practice in underserved areas. Critical Care - The Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital PICU is the setting for training in Pediatric Critical Care Medicine. Residents provide direct patient care for the sickest children in Central New York, with a wide- range of acute conditions. Emergency Medicine - Residents are the front line for children up to 19 years of age who come with medical or surgical emergencies to the area's only Pediatric Emergency Department. More than 25,000 annual visits are seen, and supervised by board certified Pediatric Emergency Medicine faculty. Developmental Pediatrics -This rotation takes advantage of some of the outstanding community resources in child development, as well as those at our Center for Neurodevelopmental Pediatrics. The Center is home to services for children with developmental and behavioral problems, including the autistic spectrum disorders, as well as those with complex medical conditions, such as spina bifida, cerebral palsy, and genetic disorders. Inpatient - Dedicated hospitalists provide oversight and direct care for the inpatients at the Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital. They also provide consultative care to other medical and surgical patients. A great deal of the education of residents and medical students is provided by these inpatient specialists. The program utilizes I-PASS for handoffs and continues to monitor quality of communication. 8 DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS Subspecialties - The curriculum provides comprehensive training in the pediatric subspecialties. Clinical instruction is available in all the major pediatric medical and surgical subspecialties. Residents are provided with elective time that allows them to create additional experiences in focused areas of the subspecialties. In the third year, residents are able to spend a clinical rotation away from the medical center. The Subspecialty/Fellowship Pathway provides a more in-depth approach to subspecialties based on resident (and their advisor) choices. Systems Based Care - A program of learning advocacy, established in 1995 as the Community Oriented Advocacy Training program, was one of the first such advocacy training programs nationally. The curriculum includes experiences in systems based care which are embedded in 3 intern rotations as well as an intern- only conference series which provides education and experiences for a wide range of advocacy skills and community related topics. Teaching Skills for Housestaff - This monthly seminar series has been offered for over 20 years and is designed to meet the needs of residents as teachers. The series addresses topics such as: delivering effective lectures, teaching at the bedside, providing feedback, evaluating students and serving as a role model. Residents also have an option of an elective in teaching skills. Evidence Based Medicine/Journal Club - The housestaff present and participate in a series of conferences designed to analyze recent literature and demonstrate possible effects on practice. These workshops are held once each month and utilize a curriculum in evidence based medicine. Global Health - Residents and students have the opportunity to participate in international health activities including Medical-Spanish immersion programs in Central America such as AMOS Health and Hope or the Enlace Project in Nicaragua and the Center for Global Health & Translational Science summer opportunities in Ecuador. Research - Many of our residents participate in active research with faculty. Residents are encouraged to write cases for publication and many manuscripts reported throughout this document were authored or co-authored by our residents and students. Residents and students have an opportunity to pursue international research through the Center for Global Health & Translational Science. Quality Improvement - All residents are required to complete a quality improvement project prior to graduation. All residents are also members of inpatient quality improvement teams. Most participate in the multidisciplinary Solutions for Patient Safety teams. There is a dedicated Quality Improvement conference series for residents throughout the year. Resident Teaching Awards - Residents are honored by the department on an annual basis through student (clerkship) identification of exemplary resident teachers. These are awarded each year at the resident graduation ceremony. We have expanded our residency program for 2016-17 to include 15 residents per year (previously 13). Undergraduate Medical Education Our 5-week clerkship provides pediatric education to approximately 160 students every year. Students participate in in- patient (2.5 weeks) and out-patient (2.5 weeks) experiences. Students are assigned to the Syracuse or the Binghamton campus. Medical students rotating through our pediatric clerkship are assigned to an outpatient program either on-site or in the community. At the Syracuse campus, they are also assigned to one of two teaching inpatient services. The hospitalists in our Inpatient Pediatrics Division oversee the inpatient curriculum. The clerkship objectives include six domains - Patient Care, Medical Knowledge, Interpersonal Communication skills, Practice Based Learning, Systems Based Practice and Professionalism. Students actively participate in patient care, teaching rounds, evidence based medicine conferences, adolescent conferences and case-based learning. Students provide a reflective narrative regarding professionalism and systems based practice issues that are reviewed by faculty DEPARTMENT REPORT 9 and the Chair and inform discussion. These narratives also form a basis for discovery of the hidden curriculum and cases for resident teaching skills and faculty development. Docs for Tots - Students in the first and second year of medical school are invited to participate in a pediatric club offering seminars, mentoring, physical examination skills rounds and advocacy/fund raising events for children. This program has grown in recent years and generally includes 25-40 students. Pediatric Growing Pains Seminars (Peds GPS) is a series of workshops provided by the education faculty to support fourth year students planning a career in pediatrics. Pediatric electives are offered in all specialties, including \"unique\" electives and concurrent electives. Selected Continuing Medical Education and Scholarly Products The department offers weekly Pediatric Grand Rounds provided to local pediatric healthcare practitioners in the Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital community. One Grand Rounds per month is dedicated to a morbidity and mortality case. Yearly special events include funded visiting professorships provided by nationally recognized invited speakers: Part 2 ABP MOC: Evaluating Child Sexual Abuse , an interactive educational activity for the practitioner about child sexual abuse examination and treatment, was developed by Dr. Ann Botash and provides 20 Part 2 MOC credits. Pediatric Hematology/Oncology: Provides bi-monthly sessions for \"Tumor Board\" with CME. Evaluation Application: Hi-Pass Student Evaluation Systems is an app for real-time feedback from preceptors to medical students, which is currently in Beta testing. Dr. Botash, author, creative copyright; Developer: AppHammer, Inc. Peds Points : This weblog was developed in 2016 to support Upstate's pediatric clerkship preceptors as a source for medical education materials and suggestions. The blog offers, \"shared wisdom from Upstate's pediatric clerkship\" through teaching tips, resources, news and announcements. Student feedback is featured regularly and the URL is blogs. upstate.edu/pedspoints . EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES Graduates of our residency program go on to careers in primary care practice and in academic medicine, in the subspecialties and in general pediatrics. In the past five years, the percentage of residents pursuing academic fellowships has ranged between 20- 60%. These have included all specialties. Our residents have joined primary care practices in the Syracuse area as well as various communities in New York State, around the country and the world. Many have joined academic faculties directly upon completion of the residency. We have recruited between 1-3 chief residents each year. Our pass rate for the American Board of Pediatrics Certifying Examination (2015-16) on the first attempt is 70-75%. On the NBME subject exam in pediatrics, the total test equated percent correct score mean was 75.4 (SD= 9.0) for first time test takers. This is above the national mean for those taking a 5 week rotation; 75.2 (SD 8.6). Both Syracuse and Binghamton students scored on average within one standard deviation of the national mean for all content areas. RESIDENT RESEARCH Pediatric Residents have the opportunity to participate in research projects with faculty. In 2015 and 2016, four residents authored seven peer-reviewed publications. In 2015, eleven residents presented posters at national meetings or SUNY Upstate's research events including Beyond the Doctorate Research Day. In 2016, fifteen residents presented posters at national meetings or SUNY Upstate's research events including Beyond the Doctorate Research Day. A list of scientific presentations can be found at the end of the report, organized by division. Residents names are denoted with an asterisk*. 10 DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS Education Budget: The departmental educational budget, including faculty, staff and other (non-personnel) expenses are just under $1 million.

CLINICAL SNAPSHOT Outpatient AND NUTRITION FACULTY Marcus Rivera, MD , Interim Division Chief, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics Mirza Beg, MD , Associate Professor of Pediatrics Manoochehr Karjoo, MD , Professor of Pediatrics, Director Emeritus Pediatrics Prateek Wali, MD, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics CLINICAL OVERVIEW The division of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition is comprised of 4 board certified pediatric gastroenterologists, who provide comprehensive outpatient and inpatient care for children with disorders related to the gastrointestinal and hepato-biliary systems. Our team also includes an incredibly dedicated nursing staff, working alongside a division-dedicated nutritionist to provide multidisciplinary care to a growing number of children. This expertise and teamwork allows us to provide our patients an exceptional level of personalized care and treatment. Patients are seen in the outpatient GI offices located on the 5th floor of the Physician's Office Building. Inpatients are cared for both in the Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital and the Crouse Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Endoscopic services are provided in the Center for Children's Surgery located on the 3rd floor in the University Hospital. Examples of disorders that we treat include: Allergic Colitis Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) Helicobacter Pylori (H. Pylori) infection Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C (HCV) infection Hyperbilirubinemia and Jaundice Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Crohn's disease, and Ulcerative colitis (UC) Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) Stomach and Duodenal Ulcers Stomach Pains Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN)16 DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS The division also operates an expanding Intestinal Failure/Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) and TPN management program under the supervision of Dr. Rivera. Working with home care providers and outpatient pharmacies, we now provide comprehensive multidisciplinary gastrointestinal, nutrition, and surgical care to these complex patients. Our division is also an active participant in ImproveCareNow, a national collaborative effort focused on managing pediatric patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). As a burgeoning Center of Excellence and one of only 3 children's Hospitals in New York to participate in this effort, we are proud to offer our families of children with IBD a unique, comprehensive, state of the art approach to IBD care. EDUCATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS The gastroenterology faculty are involved in a variety of educational activities. The pediatric residency lecture series, in which our faculty actively participate, provides the fundamental knowledge basis for recognizing and treating common GI diseases. In addition, faculty members provide residents and medical students pathways to understanding the pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of most gastrointestinal and liver diseases seen in pediatrics. Medical students have the option for an elective rotation in the division, which has become a favorite among students and has historically excellent reviews. The faculty also serves as mentors and faculty advisors to those students who elect to rotate through the division. Resident physicians from the Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital pediatric and family medicine residency programs partake in a required clinical rotation in our division, seeing both inpatients and outpatients. For many, this month- long rotation inspires them to pursue the specialty as a career. There are also opportunities to participate in clinical academic projects and potential for publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at local and national meetings. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS The division's clinical program for children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), under the supervision of Dr. Wali, has generated a number of research studies. The Protect Trial is an NIH-sponsored multicenter program examining the diagnosis and management of IBD in children. Dr. Wali is also collaborating with Dr. Kerr studying the role of SHIP expression in children with IBD. Also, as above, our involvement in the ImproveCareNow program has enabled us to actively participate in a national research and patient care initiative, recognized for its scope and success in management of pediatric IBD. The division has also been awarded a grant through the Children's Miracle Network to fund a parents' support group, which is an integral part of the care of our Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients.

In addition to serving the greater Syracuse area, we also provide care to 17 surrounding counties in Central New York. Our program is the regional sickle cell center as well as the regional hemophilia and bleeding disorders treatment center. Consultative services are available immediately for primary care physicians. Outpatient care is provided in the Waters Center for Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders located in the Upstate Cancer Center which opened in 2014. The clinic is located on the third floor in a space designed for children. The Outpatient Infusion Center is also located in this facility and serves all pediatric subspecialty patients. The physicians of the division are ready available to care for any infusion-related reactions for all children in the Center. A pediatric nurse practitioner is onsite and helps in the supervision of the care of the other subspecialty infusion patients. Inpatient care is provided in a dedicated unit in the Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital. This unit and it's nursing staff provides care for children receiving care for cancer and blood disorders. We also provide care for children undergoing autologous stem cell transplants, immunotherapy, and other biotherapy treatments. Consultative services are available throughout Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital and is also available to the infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Crouse Hospital. The Center for Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders is an active member of the Children's Oncology Group (COG). COG is an international clinical trials group supported by the National Cancer Institute and is the world's largest organization devoted exclusively to pediatric cancer research. This allows us to provide the most current therapy while keeping the children and their parents close to the support of family and friends at home. These trials include frontline treatment for many types of childhood cancers, studies aimed at determining the underlying biology of these diseases, and trials involving new and emerging treatments, supportive care, and survivorship. Our participation in the COG also allows us to contribute to the steady improvement in therapies that is now allowing nearly 80% of children diagnosed with cancer to survive.DEPARTMENT REPORT 21 Our pediatric hematology/oncology program is committed to quality which is measured by our commitment to best practices, outcomes, and our ability to prevent infections. A formal chemotherapy safety program has been implemented to aid in the establishment of standardized procedures and event tracking. We hold multidisciplinary pediatric tumor boards that meet twice monthly to discuss our patients in active treatment. A separate multidisciplinary neuro-oncology tumor board is held on a monthly basis. Ongoing quality projects include measurement of time to antibiotics for patients with febrile neutropenia, tracking of seasonal influenza vaccination rates for our active chemotherapy and sickle cell patients and working with our Children's Hospital Safety team on the tracking of our CLABSI rates in the pediatric oncology/SCT population. The Dubowy Brain Tumor Center is a multidisciplinary neuro-oncology program. The center is directed by Dr. Gloria Kennedy. The focus of the center is a dedicated clinic that is focused on the pediatric brain tumor survivor with support from the educational specialist, family therapist, and social worker. There is additional support for patients from close collaborations with pediatric neurology, pediatric neurosurgery, radiation oncology and pediatric endocrinology. The visits focus not only on the medical care and management of long term complications but also on the psychosocial and educational needs of these unique and rapidly growing group of patients. It has been well recognized that the management of children with pediatric brain and spinal cord tumors is complex and requires a special multidisciplinary team. With the addition of Dr. Melanie Comito, who brings 16 years of experience in pediatric neuro-oncology, the mission has been expanded to treat all pediatric neuro-oncology patients in the context of a specialized program. Our Comprehensive Sickle Cell Treatment Program is a state-designated center providing care to children and adolescents with sickle cell disease. The program staff is responsible for the care of all infants identified in our region by New York State's newborn screening program. Throughout the continuum of care of childhood, the care is focused on the prevention and treatment of complications. Under the guidance of Dr. Kathryn Scott, a multidisciplinary clinic is held with involvement by a dedicated nurse coordinator, educational specialist and social work support. Our Survivor Wellness Center provides comprehensive follow-up care, into adulthood, for all children, adolescents and young adults who have successfully completed their cancer therapy. Great advances in the detection and treatment of childhood cancers are helping thousands of children live longer and become long term survivors, however treatments such as radiation or chemotherapy that were used to cure the cancer have impacted the lives of survivors in many ways including physically, socially, cognitively, vocationally, spiritually, and financially. The Survivor Wellness Program educates patients about their disease and its treatment, promotes preventive medicine and provides ongoing consultation with the patients' primary care providers. We also strive to improve treatment of childhood cancers as well as management of long-term complications of therapy through clinical and laboratory research. As part of the Children's Oncology Group, the staff networks with similar programs around the world. We are able to provide information gained from the most recent clinical studies, and also contribute to scientific knowledge by performing original research.

SNAPSHOT NEPHROLOGY FACULTY Scott Schurman, MD, Associate Professor of Pediatrics, Section Head Dongmei Huang, MD, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics Thomas Welch, MD , Professor of Pediatrics, Chair, Department of Pediatrics CLINICAL OVERVIEW The Section of Nephrology provides inpatient consultation and acute dialysis care, including peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, and hemofiltration at the Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital (GCH). Outpatient dialysis care, both peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis, has long been provided at the University Dialysis Center in Syracuse. However, all outpatient dialysis care, including patient/family training will be moving to a new GCH facility as of 2017. Other outpatient services are provided in our offices at 725 Irving Ave, Suite 805, directly across the street from GCH. The section evaluates and treats infants, children, and adolescents with the full spectrum of disorders of the urinary tract. This activity includes basic nephrology, disorders such as nephrotic syndrome, glomerulonephritis, and all stages of chronic renal insufficiency. However, the section's activity has few limits. We have an established expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of children with hypertension, including 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. We care for patients with mineral metabolism disorders and metabolic bone disease, including inherited and acquired forms of rickets, osteogenesis imperfecta, and osteoporosis. Metabolic evaluations of children with urolithiasis are performed, stressing dietary measures that can minimize risk of recurrence. The section provides coordinated care to infants and children with simple and complex urologic abnormalities, including prenatal visits. Patients with congenital or other hydronephrosis and vesicoureteral reflux are evaluated and followed. We work closely with our section of pediatric urology, including a monthly combined case review. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS Role of Local Complement Synthesis in the Kidney Dr. Welch has a long-standing interest in the role of locally synthesized complement components in the progression of glomerulonephritis to end stage kidney disease. He has developed an animal model of immune glomerulonephritis, and has demonstrated the importance of tubular synthesis of several complement proteins to the clinical and histologic progression of the disorder. This corresponds with similar observations he previously made in human material. Most recently, he has been working with Dr. Middleton in the Neuroscience and Physiology Department to define the patterns of renal gene expression as the disease progresses. This has led to understanding of the role of angiotensin converting enzyme therapy in attenuating the progression of glomerulonephritis by down regulating the expression of several collagen genes. Research in Dr. Welch's laboratory includes development of a murine model of diarrhea-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Using mice injected with purified Shiga toxin, he has been able to very closely reproduce the histologic appearance of HUS. Once the time course of this model is defined more precisely, a variety of therapeutic interventions will be employed to see if the course of the disease can be modified. DEPARTMENT REPORT 31 Scope Collaborative The Pediatric Nephrology Center at GCH participates in the Standardizing Care to Improve Outcomes in Pediatric ESRD (SCOPE) Collaborative. A Quality Transformation Network, the SCOPE Collaborative has focused on catheter-related infection prevention by implementing evidence-based catheter care bundles: peritoneal dialysis catheter bundles were implemented beginning September 2011, and bundles expanded to hemodialysis catheters in September 2013. SCOPE is a large scale QI project involving 29 pediatric nephrology centers through the US. The collaborative has achieved substantial improvement in prevention of catheter related infection and hospitalization.

CLINICAL SNAPSHOT Total Pediatric Arthritis 2015: ................. 1245 N/A 2016: ................. 50 DEPARTMENT SPECIALTIES PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIOLOGY FACULTY Full-Time: Bettina Smallman, MD, Professor of Anesthesiology and Pediatrics, Division Jadwiga Bednarczyk, MD , Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology Rahila Bilal, MD , Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology Joseph Resti, MD, Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology Jan Wong, MD, Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology Part-Time: Richard Beers, MD , Professor of Anesthesiology Tracy Buckingham, MD , Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology Robert Calimlim, MD , Associate Professor of Anesthesiology Elizabeth Demers-Lavelle, MD, Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology Fenghua Li, MD, Associate Professor of Anesthesiology Jeremy McKay, MD, Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology David Romano, MD, Associate Professor of Anesthesiology CLINICAL OVERVIEW The Division of Pediatric Anesthesia in the Department of Anesthesiology has been experiencing significant growth. Surgeons from all specialties provide care for children requiring surgery in the Olivia Louise Pietrafesa Center for Children's Surgery (CCS). In addition, the demand for procedures conducted outside the operating room environment (CT, MRI, Interventional Radiology, Radiation Therapy and Nuclear Medicine) continues to grow steadily. The pediatric medical specialties, such as pulmonology and gastroenterology, have increased their procedural volume, and the pediatric oncologists have continued to utilize pediatric anesthesiology services frequently for interventional procedures. As one of the few referral centers in Central New York for children undergoing MRIs and CTs, we have been able to streamline the process, making it safe and efficient to accommodate an ever-increasing demand. The section of pediatric Anesthesia participates actively in anesthesia coverage at the Upstate Ambulatory Surgical Center. With the arrival of new pediatric surgeons and pediatric urologists many pediatric patients are cared for in the outpatient setting. The Pediatric Anesthesia Division continued to show a strong commitment to the education of our anesthesiology residents and medical students. In addition to active participation in patient care, residents rotating in pediatric anesthesiology undergo a series of didactic lectures and journal clubs. Our team also teaches basic pediatric airway skills to Pediatric and Emergency Medicine residents and fellows who rotate through the CCS.40 DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS PEDIATRIC CARDIOVASCULAR-THORACIC SURGERY FACULTY George Alfieris, MD , Assistant Professor of Clinical Surgery and Pediatrics Francisco Gensini, MD, Assistant Professor of Clinical Surgery CLINICAL OVERVIEW For a city of its size, Syracuse is very fortunate to have a high quality, nationally known program in congenital cardiac surgery. Part of the reason this program has been successful is the innovative arrangement Dr. Alfieris has developed with the University of Rochester, by which his time is shared between both institutions. This has enabled both programs to benefit from skilled surgery and has allowed Dr. Alfieris to undertake a higher volume of cases than he would at either center alone. PEDIATRIC SURGERY FACULTY Andreas H. Meier, MD, MEd , Michael and Rissa Ratner Professor of Surgery and Pediatrics, Division Director, General Surgery Residency Program Director and Vice Chair for Education, Department of Surgery Tamer A. Ahmed, MD , Assistant Professor of Surgery and Pediatrics, Liaison Surgeon for the Children's Oncology Group Jennifer D. Stanger, MD, MSc , Assistant Professor of Surgery and Pediatrics, Pediatric NSQiP Champion Surgeon Kim G. Wallenstein, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Surgery and Pediatrics, Director, Pediatric Trauma Program CLINICAL OVERVIEW Members of the Division of Pediatric Surgery provide care to children at the Golisano Children's Hospital as well as the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Crouse Hospital. Our neonatal patients demonstrate a wide range of congenital anomalies as well as those conditions acquired in the very early days of infancy. Close rapport with our neonatal colleagues has been the hallmark of our neonatal effort for the past 40 years. At the Golisano Children's Hospital, our patients comprise the full range of the surgical problems of infancy and childhood and the division performs close to 2,000 operations per year. A close working relationship with the Division of General Pediatrics as well as all pediatric medical subspecialties affords the close collaboration that patients with these complex issues deserve. In addition, excellent relationships with all pediatric surgical subspecialties exists leading to a wide array of treatments necessary for the care of the children of Central New York. We have developed a significant interest in intestinal failure and severe constipation and have worked closely with our colleagues in the section of pediatric gastroenterology. Both inpatient and outpatient procedures are performed at the Pietrafesa Center for Children's Surgery, a separate operating suite for children in the University Hospital. Our outpatient clinic is located at 725 Irving Ave. with many other pediatric specialty programs. Since 2014, the Pediatric Trauma program has been accredited by the American College of Surgeons as a pediatric level 1 trauma center. Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital was the first pediatric hospital in New York State to receive this accreditation and there are currently only four programs in the state. Under the leadership of Dr. Wallenstein, we are currently undergoing the recertification process that will end in February 2017.DEPARTMENT REPORT 41 Dr. Jennifer Stanger, who joined us in the fall of 2014, has already established a busy clinical practice. She has focused on scholarly activity and quality improvement efforts for surgical care within Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital. In this role she will also be the champion surgeon for the pediatric National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQiP) which will begin collecting data this fall. Our educational efforts focus on teaching third and fourth year medical students as well as our junior and senior level general surgery residents. We are also pleased to participate in the educational efforts of the pediatric residency program. Second year residents from this program join us for a month to get exposure to our inpatient and outpatient activities. Overall we are pleased that our educational efforts are valued highly by all of these learners. We have had a long history of successful matches into pediatric surgery fellowships which is considered extremely competitive. Since October 2014, Dr. Meier has taken on the leadership of the General Surgery Residency as its program director. In this role, he has participated in multiple research projects on surgical education and co-authored multiple publications. PEDIATRIC NEUROSURGERY FACULTY Zulma Tovar-Spinoza MD , Associate Professor of Neurosurgery and Pediatrics, Director of Pediatric Neurosurgery Satish Krishnamurthy MD, MCh , Professor of Neurosurgery, Director Minimally Invasive Surgery CLINICAL OVERVIEW The Pediatric Neurosurgery division provides care for children with structural disorders of the brain and spinal cord. Our patients are from the regional community with some referrals from other states including from other countries. We enjoy collaborating with expert pediatric neurologists, neuroradiologists, neonatologists and intensivists. We participate regularly with the Pediatric Epilepsy Center, Spina Bifida Program, Cranio-facial Center, Center for Development, Trauma, Behavior and Genetics and the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Programs. The division has expertise in the treatment of brain and spine tumors, congenital and developmental malformations, epilepsy, hydrocephalus, nervous system vascular lesions, pediatric brain trauma, and spasticity. Neurosurgeons in the division provide a complete array of pediatric services including: Surgical treatment of congenital and developmental lesions of the nervous system [Spina bifida, Chiari Malformation, Cranio cervical spine abnormalities, tethered cord] Surgical treatment of brain and spine tumors [Open surgery and endoscopic] Surgical treatment of craniosynostosis [skull reconstructive surgery] Surgical treatment of epilepsy [invasive monitoring and resection of the brain area producing epilepsy] Surgical treatment of hydrocephalus [shunts and endoscopic third Dorsal Rhizotomies] Surgical treatment of arterio-venous malformations, Moyamoya disease] Dr. Zulma Tovar-Spinoza has also established the only center in Upstate New York to offer MRI Guided laser ablation surgery as an option for patients with brain tumors and epilepsy. The use of other new technologies are incorporated to improve the endoscopic and minimally invasive treatment of brain tumors, including lesions seen in tuberous sclerosis complex. 42 DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS The Spina Bifida program has been consolidated with a multidisciplinary team lead by Dr. Nienke Dosa. The team includes Dr. Danielle Katz (pediatric orthopedics), Dr. Jonathan Ridell (pediatric urology), and Dr. Tovar-Spinoza. The faculty has participated in educational sessions with patients and families and created a network of communication to keep the care of these complex patients up-to-date. The division has established a continuous and active pre-natal consultation for the parents of individuals identified with central nervous system lesions. That allows correct preparation of the family as well as the discussion of possible immediate surgical procedures. Faculty provide surgical solution to patients with craniosynostisis, as well as treating patients with plagiocephaly in our clinic. In conjunction with Dr. Sherard Tatum (Otolaryngology) we provide a multidisciplinary approach to these patients. The faculty are active colleagues in the operation of the pediatric trauma program. Endoscopic surgery for simple and complex hydrocephalus continues to be the preferred approach in our division. However, when this is not an option and shunts need to be used, optimization of these devices are utilized. Dr. Krishnamurthy continues his research on using a sensor to determine if a shunt has a normal or dysfunctional flow. Faculty have reviewed the St. Louis Children's and the Vancouver protocols for patients with spastic diplegia and developed improved protocols. The division opened a Tone Management Program in conjunction with Drs. Turk and Kanter from the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and offers a comprehensive plan for the treatment of these patients.
