This is to be valued in thatof all factors affecting health in the United States, none is moreimportant than nutrition. This can be argued from variousperspectives, including health promotion, disease prevention, andtherapeutic management. In all cases, serious consideration ofnutrition related issues in the practice is seen to be one means toachieve cost-effective medical care. These modules were developed toprovide more practi:al knowledge for health care providers, and inparticular primary care physicians. This module is designed to helpprimary care physicians become ci:itical reviewers of nutritionalinformation. These skills will help the physician to be able tocritique nutritional claims and teach patients how to assess faddiets and popular nutritional products. Included are learning goalsand objectives, a self-check of achievement with regard to goals, andreferences for the physician and for the physician to recommend topatients. Appendices include patient handouts concerning avoidance ofnutritional quackery, and the dangers of herbal teas.

Newspaper ads lurepeople to purchase products for treatment of self-diagnosed ailments. Magazines andbooks promote claims that manipulation of the diet and use of \"supplements\" areessential to hea.th. Supermarkets for their customers' \"benefit.\" And nearly every shopping center contains ahealth food store with rows of high-priced products and scores of pamphlets which tellthe consumer what to buy.Physicians recognize that nutrition fallacies, fad diets, and bogus nutrition products arecommonplace in our society. However, patients often do not have the knowledge toevaluate diets and nutrition products. How can you guide patients away from use of faddiets and nutrition products which are not beneficial' How can you help patientsevaluate non-scientific nutrition literature which is used to support nutrition fallacies?The answers to these and other questions are included in this module. The goal of this module is to help the primary care physician become a critical reviewerof nutrition information. As a patient advocate, the physician will be able to critiquenutritional claims and teach patients how to assess fad diets and popular nutritionalproducts. ObjectivesUpon completion of this module, you will be able to:1.Evaluate fad diets and the claims of nutrition products in a scientific manner.2.Inform patients h w to determine potential dangers and benefits of fad diets andnutrition supplements.3.Compile a data base of sound sources of diet and nutrition product information forpersonal and patient education.4.Guide patients away from use of unnecessary nutrition products.S.Teach patients how to make sound decisions when confronted with fad diets andclaims.6.Evaluate and apply scientific nutritior literature to clinical practice. Nutrition in Health Promotion Identifying Sound, Scientific Literaturein Order to Evaluate Nutrition ClaimsAs a physician, you can help protect your pa-tients from nutrition fallacies by identifyingfaulty conclusions from the literature and ex-plaining their pitfalls during office visits. Anec-dotal evidence and epidemiological research donot determine cause/effect relationships. Con-trols are needed so that only one variable ischanged at a time before cause and effect is avalid conclusion. Freedom of the press allows publication of any pointof view, regardless of how inaccurate or outrageous itmight be. Often, misinformation or claims designed tosell a product reach the public via the media. Lay peoplemay not understand how to evaluate evidence to deter-mine if a claim or conclusion has merit. They frequent4,accept as \"truth\" that which sounds logical to them.Physicians need to be able to identify sound, scientificevidence if they are to evaluate popular nutrition claimsand help patients avoid nutrition fallacies.Many nutrition fallacies are based upon anecdotalevidence. Such evidence should not be interpreted toprove cause and effect because variables are not con-trolled. It is appropriate to use anecdotal evidence, suchas a series of case reports, to generate hypotheses. How-ever, each hypothesis must be tested by an observationalstudy which utilizes comparison groups. Only aftercompletion of an observational study can an experimentbe designed which attempts to identify cause and effect.Some fad claims are based upon epidemiologicalstudies which attempt to correlate factors between twoor more populations. Scientists agree that such studiescannot be used to determine cause-effect relationshipsbecause controls are hard to achieve. When populationsare compared, one should ask, \"What factors are differ-ent between the populations in the study?\" Differencesin genetics, climate, lifestyle, and food intake areexamples of variables which can skew the interpretationof epidemiological research.If populations used in an epidemiological study are assimilar as possible, one should ask, \"How important isthe influence of one variable upon another?\" This can beapproximated by squaring the correlation coefficient.For example, a correlation coefficient of 0.4 wouldsuggest that 0.16 or 16% of the variation of one factorcould be attributed to the other factor; i.e., 84% of thevariation would be due to some oche' factor(s).When experimental studies are critiqued, one shouldask, \"How many variables were changed and how werethey changed during the study?\" One should also ask,\"Are the conclusions appropriate?\" It is obviously mis-,leading to test one variable experimentally and thenapply the conclusions to another untested variable. Yetthis kind of error often appears in the scientific literature.When scientific literature is interpreted, regardless ofwhich type of research is reported, health professionalsmust ask whether or not results are in conflict withknowledge already known about the subject. If not inconflict, results can be used to extend current knowledge.If results are in conflict, one must consider two possi-bilities: either reexamination of previous knowledge isnecessary, or the authors have made an error in studydesign or interpretation. Careful review of the assump-tions, approach, and interpretation should help deter-mine which of these possibilities is most likely.Recent articles which promote nutrition fallacies havebegun to list references from journals which \"support\"their claims. Often, the studies cited contain conclusionswhich have been taken out of context. Some quotationsare made from journals which were published a long timeago and ignore more recent research which does notsupport claims made. Other references cited are publishedin journals which are not subject to peer review. If thepublic is to be protected from such shams, the physicianmust be skilled at identifying faulty conclusions from theliterature and explaining their pitfalls to patients. Why There Are So Many Fad Diets0111111wMIiNiM.Most patients have followed one or more faddiets in an effort tc achieve quick weight loss.Fad diets attempt to cure a weight problem, butthey often do not change eating habits or pro-mote lasting weight control. Understandingwhy fad diets are popular is a first step inredirecting patients toward healthful weight-control methods.il.Bookstore shelves are crowded with books whichpromise \"quick, easy, guaranteed\" weight loss. People Decoding Fad Diets 3 try one diet after another in search of \"the diet\" whichwill allow them to achieve their goal. There are manyreasons why diet books continue their widespread popu-larity even though little, if any, vieigltt loss is achievedand maintained.'.. Cultural Pressure. Many people have a strong culturalvalue that they must be \"thin\" to be act.cpted, success-ful, or beautiful. Often, this is an emotional issue.2. Unrealistic Expectations. Most people search for a\"magic cure\" which is relatively easy and promisesquick results. They want to believe that easy weightcontrol is possible. \"I just haven't found the rightdiet yet.\"3. Advertising Pressure. Advertising suggests that fa-mous celebrities have achieved their success and at-tractive figures by following such plans. Consumersoften believe these claims.4. Peer Pressure. Peer pressure may convince people that\"everyone goes on diets.\"5. Unrealistic Plans. Unrealistic plans for weight main-tenance result in weight gain once \"the diet\" isstopped. People become trapped in a vicious cycle asthey try diet after diet in an effort to find one whichproduces lasting results.Diets are viewed by most people as a temporary changein behavior. They perceive them as a quick and easyapproach which allows them to continue to eat whateverappeals to them in unlimited quantities. Fad dietsattempt to correct a weight problem, but they areunsuccessful because they do not permanently changeeating habits.Two plausible reasons fad diets may not point\" theory and the \"visualization\" theory.The \"setpoint\" theory suggests that people have aninternal mechanism which regulates body weight. Faddiets generally do not effectively lower or maintainweight below the setpoint. Internal mechanisms appearto continuously work to return weight to the predeter-mined setpoint level. Regular exercise, however, mayhelp lower the setpoint, while a diet of high -fat foodsmay raise the setpoint.'The \"visualization\" theory suggests that people mustbe able to \"visualize\" themselves at their weight goal. Ifthey do not do this, they will subconsciously find ways toregain weight to achieve the weight which they picturefor \"themselves.\" This occurs even if they consciouslywish to weigh less.' Fad diets us,ally do not help peoplelearn to visualize themselves at their weight goal.Most fad diets fail because they are based on gimmickswhich defy laws of energy and biochemistry. Some sug-gest weight can be lost by eating unlimited quantities ofcertain foods. Others explain the weight loss processusing bizarre descriptions of how the human body digestsfood and stores or loses fat. Such descriptions may soundlogical to those who are not familiar with digestion,absorption, and metabolism. Fad diets often fail becausethey are monotonous, unpalatable, socially unacceptable,and/or cause and sometimes sideeffects.Diets Which Are SoundSound weight-reduction diets are ones whichare individualized to a patient's usual way ofeating, to lifestyle, and to food preferences.Behavior modification, visualization, dietfollow-up, and an exercise program are criticalcomponents of successful, permanent-weight-loss diet programs. Sound weight-reduction diets are ones which do notpromise miraculous cures but which are individualized toa patient's usual way of eating, to lifestyle, and to foodpreferences. A well-planned weight-reduction diet musttake into account a patient's physical activity level whencalculating the number of calories allowed for the day'sintake. Certainly calories ingested must be less thancalories expended, or the patient will not lose weight.Sound weight-reduction diets should promcite no morethan 1-2 pounds of fat loss per week, and in generalshould not be less than 1000-1200 kcal/day for womennor less than 1200-1500 kcal/day for men. At levelsless than these, meeting the RDA for vitamins, minerals,and protein is difficult. Recommendations from theGuide to Good Eating3 are good to keep in mind whenplanning sound weight-reduction diets. The recommen-dations in the Guide will provide approximately 1200kcal/day. Itis also wise to remember that weight-reduction diets should contain a minimum of 100 gramsof carbohydrate daily in order to prevent ketosis, unlessthe patient is monitored frequently for various bloodtests. Behavior modification, visualization, diet follow-up, and an exercise program are critical components ofsuccessful, permanent-weight-loss diet programs.The physician can ask seveial questions to determine ifa diet is not sound. If the answer is \"yes\" to any of the I () 4 Nutrition in Health Promotion following questions, the diet may not promote perma-nent weight control and may result in undesirable sideeffects:Does it promote quick, effortless weight loss?Does it claim that unlimited quantities of food canbe eaten?Does it claim that the rate of weight loss can beincreased by use of certain \"supplements\" and/orcombinations of foods?Does it claim success based solely on anecdotalevidence and testimonials?Does it claim that \"spot weight reduction\" of bodyparts such as thighs and tummy is possible? Is theterm \"cellulite\" used?Does it contain a limited variety foods? Is thecalorie level less than 1000-1200 kcal/day? Doesit contain less than 0.8 gm of protein per kg of idealbody weight? Does it provide less than 100 gm ofcarbohydrate per day?Does it emphasize one type of food at the expenseof other foods?Does it recommend periods of fasting?Does it promote use of diuretics or laxatives?Does it focus on diet without emphasizing the needfor permanent changes in eating (and exercise)habits? Does it fail to include a plan for weightmaintenance?Does itfailto encourage frequent follow-upcounseling sessions with a dietitian or physiciantrained in nutrition and behavior modification?Does it fail to use weight-control support groupswhen indicated?Does itfail to teach people how to visualizethemselves at their weight goal?TA is impossible to keep up with the amount of fadweight-loss diets and diet pills which appear yearly. Overthe past several years, diets have generally divided them-selves into six bask categories. Table 20-1 has beendeveloped to assist you in classifying old diets, currentfad diets, and \"yet to be developed\" fad diets for weightloss. Without knowing everything about the diet you canidentify advantages, possible problems, and fallaciesconcerning these diets. Table 20-2, in similar format,contains information that you should know concerningover-the-counter diet pills for weight reduction.It is often appropriate to refer patients for assistance inweight loss to one of several community self-help groupsor group diet programs. Table 20-3 provides an identifi-cation of tile most popular weight-loss groups and offersa critique of each program for assistance in helping youfit patients into a group if appropria Redirecting the Patient to Use SoundWeight-Control PlansBefore the patient can make the critical choiceof a sound weight-reduction diet over a fadweight-loss diet, a caring relationship betweenthe physician and the patient must be estab-lished. Some patients may be skeptical of profes-sional opinions about fad diets. Fad diets shouldbe discredited without insulting the patient'sintelligence. As the physician, you are always in the business ofhealth promotion and prevention of disease by directingpatients to assume responsibility for their own health.Nowhere is this more evident than ')y assisting patientsin achieving an appropriate weight for height. Fromexperience you have learned that there are many positiveways (and there are other less positive ways) to approachpatients regarding needed weight loss. Because it isessential to obtain the patient's consent and boost moti-vation to follow a well-planned weight-reduction dietbefore success can be achieved, the following importantpoints should be remembered:1. Patients must recognize that you care about them. Agood relationship must be built before beliefs about`dieting\" should be challenged.2. Emotional needs of the patient must be met beforescientific knowledge can be successfully used to dis-credit fad dieting.3.It is helpful for you to identify benefits the patientexpects from the fad diet. Alternatives can then beoffered which help the patient achieve these benefitsby using sound weight-control plans instead of faddiets.4. The patient should be encouraged to compare thebenefits of sound weight-control plans with thedrawbacks and dangers of fad diets.

The diet providesapproximately 1000 kcal/day and is combined with daily counselingif desired by the client. People are encouraged to take a DietCenter Supplement four times a day. The supplement contains B-vitamins (at megadose levels), protein, and sugar and is supposedraise the blood sugar to a level which decreases appetite. Noscientific evidence indicates that such a supplement is effectiveother than to provide a short-term placebo effect. The expense ofthe supplement is probably not justified. This type of programtends to teach people that weight control is a temporary effortrather than a life-long change in eating habits. This program ismore expensive than weekly visits to a registered dietitian forweightcontrol counseling. Nutri-System Clients who follow this program eat Nutri-System's prepackaged mealsto control their caloric intake. Food preparation and menu planningare done for clients, thus they do not learn how to make wise foodchoices.This is a major drawback which \"sets the client up\" forrebound weight gain once the program is discontinued. Weeklycounseling is provided for an additional fee. This program is moreexpensive than weekly visits to a registered dietitian for weight-control counseling. Overeaters Anonymous People who belong to this organization view overeating as anaddiction which cannot be cured. Meetings are modeled afterAlcoholics Anonymous and may appeal only to those who \"compulsive eaters.\" Low-calorie diets may be giveto members,but the majority of time is spent discussing ways to control eatingbehaviors.Members may not learn how to make wise food choices.There is no set fee. TOPS (Taking Off Pounds Sensibly) Members of this women's organization attend weekly meetings toreceive group support and set weight-loss goals. Quality of groupsessions varies depending upon the skills of the leader. People maybe \"turned off\" by weekly weigh-ins which are not kept confidential.Those who do not lose weight may be \"put on the spot\" andembarrassed. Members frequently admit that they avoid eating anddrinking the day prior to a meeting so they lose weight. It is notuncommon for groups to go out for dessert after each r,eeting tocelebrate by overeating! Unfortunately, this approach does notpromote change in eating habits. Weight Watchers, Inc. This organization offers several diet plans which are based upon thediabetic diet exchange lists. Many health professionals recommendthis program.Safe weight loss is encouraged. Members attendweekly meetings to obtain group support, recipes, and weight-losstips.Weight maintenance diets are provided when weight goals arereached.The company sells a variety of lower calorie foods,cookbooks, and magazines which members may be encouraged to buy.Cost of the program varies depending upon the number of productspurchased by the client. 2, to 12 Nutrition in Health. Promotion cost, long-range ineffectiveness, and potential harmto health are factors which may help convince thepatient.5. Patience and reinforcement of weight loss duringseveral office visits will probably be necessary.6. A confrontation with the patient should be avoided ifat all possible when trying to change erroneousbeliefs.7. Some patients will be skeptical of professionalopinions about fad diets. The public has been led tobelieve that physicians discredit fad diets becausethey conspire to withhold \"the key\" for weight loss.These are the most difficult patients to work withand require more effort before they trust youropinion.'The material in Appendix A may help even the mostskeptical of patients to consider the merits and possibleproblems of fad diets. This handout should be of value toyour patients in educating them to decide for themselveswhether or not what they read or hear regarding specificnutrition and food claims is or is not valid. Fad Diets and Adolescent GirlsAn ExampleUse of fad diets is of particular concern amongadolescents. Physicians can be instrumental inguiding adolescent patients away from fad dietstoward use of healthful weight-control meas-ures. Development of sound attitudes about thepitfalls of fad diets can benefit adolescentsthroughout their lives. As a result of \"thin is in\" peer pressure, as many as onein three teenage girls is on a \"diet.\" Often, one crash dietafter another will be tried as girls search for an easy,magical route to achieve their perceptions of \"idealweight.\" Fad diets are used by overfat teenagers as well asthose who are not significantly overfat but are preoccu-pied with their body image.Adolescence is a period of growth and is not theappropriate time for restrictive caloric intake. While it isdifficult to objectively determine damage to healthcaused by teenage fad diets, inadequate intake of nutri-ents and calories cannot promote optimum development.At least 1600 kcal/day should be eaten by girls who areactively growing and have not yet reached menarche.For overfat teens, the goal should be to preventadditional weight gain and allow them to \"grow into\"their weight (for example. a 5'1\", 140 pound, 10-year-old can achieve a more desirable level of fatness bymaintaining weight at 140 pounds while growing to 5'5\"at 14 years of age). Girls who have reached their adultheight should eat at least 1200 kci,l/day.Prevention of obesity or overfatness in teens may bestbe accomplished by regular aerobic exercise rather thandiet.' This is especially true for children who are soinactive that overfatness occurs even though food intakeis normal.'Diet recommendations should be limited to use of leanmeats, low-fat dairy products, fruits, vegetables, breads,and cereals. Frequent use of calorie-dense foods (desserts,soda pop, chips, high-fat foods) which provide fewvitamins and minerals should be discouraged. Lowercalorie alternatives which appeal to teens include sugar-free soda pop, beverages sweetened with aspartame(Nutra-Sweet), frozen pudding bars, frozen gelatin pops,unbuttered popcorn, and angel food cake.Exercise provides several benefits for weight control.With exercise, food intake may decrease or increaseslightly (but usually not enough to offset the energyexpenditure of exercise). Metabolic rate increases duringexercise and results in greater caloric expenditure. Asregular exercise increases the percentage of lean bodymass, metabolic rate is elevated. Exercise also mayregulate fat cell size and delay or inhibit increases in fatcell numbers during adolescent growth)\" Yet anotherbenefit of exercise isits abi:ay to lower the body'ssetpoint (the theoretical control mechanism which regu-lates body weight and fat). The following guidelines maybe helpful when recommending an exercise program foradolescents':Exercise should be fun, vigorous, and focused onactivities that can be easily practiced throughoutlife so that the habit of regular exercise is developed.Frequency and duration of exercise are moreimportant than the speed at which it is done. One-half hour of aerobic exercise done 3-4 times a week(or more often) is desirable.Walking, bicycling, and swimming are good exer-cises for those who arc out of condition.Group exercises such as aerobic dance may appealto some. Groups which meet 2-3 times a week forworkouts which include flexibility, warm-up,aerobic, and cool-down exercises are effective.24 Decoding Fad Diets Helping Patients Avoid NutritionQuackery711=1,It is helpful if the physician understands whypatients, including adolescents, believe nutri-tion misinformation. Once a trusting relation-ship is established, the physician can reinforcepositive behaviors and encourage the patient toselect nutrition therapies that are based uponscientific evidence and which can be practicedfor a lifetime. There are several reasons nutrition misinformation isprevalent. Well-meaning people believe they help otherswhen they give testimonials explaining their \"success\"using \"nutritional therapies.\"People may be encouraged to self-diagnose and treat\"conditions\" or potential illnesses. \"Diseases\" may beinvented which explain minor aches, pains, and symp-toms. Magical cures often are more reassuring than scien-tific facts. Justification for use of \"nutrition products\"may contain a few facts woven togetly_-- with muchnonsense, all of which may sound surprisingly logical.Some may not recognize that many minor ailmentsimprove with time, regardless of the treatment (or lackof treatment) used. They often assume that \"theremedy\" caused the cure when actually they would haverecuperated without treatment. Lack of understandingof the placebo effect compounds this problem. Somebelieve, \"Just because it didn't work for you doesn'tmean that it might not work for me.\"12Promoters of nutrition misinformation appeal topersonal concerns and make every effort to meet cus-tomers' needs. The media often perpetuate nutritionfallacies. Media personnel and non-medical personsseldom challenge the credentials of self-prc,:laimedexpects or demand that claims be subject to peer review.Also, when results of scientific studies are reported, thesepersons may misinterpret, twist, or exaggerate claims.Patients' beliefs about nutrition and use of nutrition\"supplements\" are deep-seated and ditficult to change.The most effective method is a common-sense approachwhich takes into account the patient's beliefs aboutnutrition and dieting.Once a trusting relationship between patient andphysician is established, the physician can encourageattitude change while reinforcing positive behaviors.Confrontation of an undesirable practice may make thepatient even more resistant to change. See the section,\"Redirecting the Patient to Use Sound Weight-ControlPlans\" for more ideas, and Appendix A for a usefulpatient handout.Evaluating Claims About NutritionProducts111011:11-VAnswers to key questions are useful when evalu-ating claims made about nutrition products.Claims such as \"richest source of a toxic side effects\" should be redflags to physicians and patients that the productmay not be legitimate.=M=II1OLAdvertisements and labels for nutrition supplementsand products make claims which cften seem quite logical.However, each product should be evaluated according tothe following questions to determine if claims arelegitimate. 1.Is the product really a good source of nutrients?Even though a supplement is a rich source of nutrients,it may not contribute significantly to the overallnutriture of a person. Determine how much of theproduct one would have to take to replace a food sourcewhich is rich in the same nutrient. For example, pro-ponents of bee pollen claim it contains more protein thanbeef, eggs, or cheese. Information obtained from productliterature suggests one would have to take approximatelyeight tablespoons of bee pollen to provide the sameamount of protein found in one ounce of cheese. Twotablespoons is the seller's recommended dose per day.This is hardly a significant contribution to protein intake(and is an expensive protein source)!2. Are nutrients provided by the t oduct actuallydeficient in the user's diet?Once an adequate intake has been achieved, additionalnutrients are unnecessary and do not participate in theirusual functions. For example, excess proteins (aminoacids) are burned for energy or F!ored as fat; vitaminstaken in excess will produce a pharmacologic action.3. What words are used to describe the product?Many products are labeled \"natural\" or \"organic.\"25 14 Nutrition in Health Promotion These terms have no real meaning. The human bodycannot tell the difference between a natural or syntheticsource -f a nutrient. Organic products supposedly havebeen grown in soil which has not been exposed topesticides and herbicides. There are no laws whichgovern use of the term \"organic,\" and products labeledas such are of ten from the same fields as products notlabeled \"organic.\" The cost of \"organic\" products maybe 2 to 6 times that of a similar \"non-organic\" product.4. Does the product claim its nutrients are more potentthan those from other food sources?The body recognizes nurricilis by their chemicalstructure. For ex-Ample, in general there is only onechemical formula for f.ach vitamin which the body recog-nizes and can use. It is not possible to create more potentforms of vitamins, minerals, protein, and other nutrients.Product labels which claim \"high potency\" benefits aremeaningless and mislead the consumer. In addition,some products are inactive, although advertisements maysay they function as active substances. Some products areeven made up of substances which are falsely advertisedto be essential to humans. While it is true that there aredifferent forms of some substances (calcium, for exam-ple. as calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, and cal-cium gluconate) many advertisements do not differen-tiate between these forms nor indicate they are absorbedto various degrees.S. Do claims make sense when compared to mechanismsof human digestion, absorption, and metabolism?Many fad products, if they were effective, would haveto distort or contradict laws of biochemistry whichregulate utilization of food in humans. Literature of one\"digestive aid\" claims that people should use the productwhen they overeat to \"supplement\" the body's digestivesecretions. Health professionals know that people pro-duce more digestive enzymes than are needed, even if theyhave eaten too much. En7vmes taken by mouth aredigested(like any protein) and have no enzymaticactivity. Such a digestive supplement would be of no use.6. What kind of evidence is propagated to justify usefad products?Fad products usually rely on anecdotal information,testimonials, and uncontrolled studies to support use ofthe products. Some companies include impressive refer-ence lists with citations from respected protessionaljournals in their product literature. U.ifortunately, manyof these studies have been taken out of context or havebeen used to make premature conclusions from insuf-ficient data.7. What is the potential for harm?Undesirable effects from use of fad products vary.Some products cause no physical problems, but they mayencourage self-diagnosis and treatment of known medi-cal problems. Other products cause significant sideeffects. For example, lecithin (used by maturing adults toimprove memory) can cause gastrointestinal distress,dizziness, anorexia, depression, and other symptoms.Potential for provoking such side effects underscores theimportance of asking questions about use of nutritionalsupplements and products when interviewing patients.Table 20-4, Nutritional Supplements Fact orFiction, includes information which will help youevaluate several popular nutrition supplements.Little Known Dangers of Herbal TeasThe physician should be familiar with the po-tential dangers of herbal teas. There are noregulations which ban the sale of potentiallydangerous herbal products. Physicians shouldadvise patients to avoid herbal teas unless in-gredients are listed, and to drink only thosewhich are safe. Popularity of some herbal teas should be cause forconcern among health professionals. Health food storesand some supermarkets sell a wide variety of herbs andherbal teas, including some which can be dangerous orcause undesirable side-effects. Unfortunately, the publicbelieves that all herbal teas are wholesome. Actually,there are no regulations which ban the sal: of potentiallydangerous herbal products.Companies are not required to list herbal tea ingredi-ents, and many do not. There are no standards of quality,and various samples of the same herb .iiixture maycontain different quantities of ingredients. The bestadvice a physiciar can offer is to suggest patients buyonly those hetproducts w Bch list all ingredients.People shouldid herbs listedin the patient ?,..adout (Appendix B).The literature reports several cases of illness resultingfrom use of herbal tea.

Whileseveral other factors could have contributed to herproblem, use of the tea probably had a major effect.26Use of herbal teas in the clear liquid diet for manage-ment of acute diarrhea should be discouraged sinceseveral herbs can aggravate diarrhea. Patients with per-plexing symptoms should be questioned about theirconsumption of herbal teas. If heavy usage has occurred,it may be of value to have the product analyzed todetermine the presence of pharmacologic substanceswhich could trigger the problems. Table 20-5 includes asummary of some pharmacologic effects caused by herbs.SummaryUse of fad diets and nutrition supplernen :s can beharmful to health and, at the very least, in many cases,they are a waste of money. Americans spend millions ofdollars each year on the false belief that they are attain-ing a higher degree of health by use of such diets andproducts. Physicians can be influential in helping pa-tients make wise decisions when they are confrontedwith nutrition claims. The prosperity of nutritionquackery can be reduced significantly if consumers,through their physicians, learn how to better evaluatediet and nutrition products. 3 Pi 22 Nutrition in Health Promotion Table 20-5Pharmacologic Actions of Commonly Used Herbs NERDS AND PHARNACOLOGIC ACTIONS ADDITIONAL TOXIC EFFECTSAbortifacients Can induce spontaneous abortion in pregnant women.----UWE' rootDevil's rootPennyroyal Allergenic AgentsChamomileChamomile may trigger allergic to ragweed, asters, chrysanthemums, or other members ofGoldenrod this plant family.

To raise your level of awareness of your patient's \"nutrition environment,\"do the following exercises, then discuss them with fellow residents, faculty, andavailable nutrition specialists.1. Get to know your surroundings. Check the yellow pages of your phone directoryfor the presence of health food centers and diet and weight-loss clinics in your area.Visit some of these centers and clinics. Remember, if a center of clinic is in yourpractice area, it means there is a market for its services. Also visit supermarkets inyour area. Many supermarkets now contain diet and health food sections. As youvisit these centers, clinics, and stores, ask the following questions:A. What types of claims are being made for products and services offered?B.Are the services and/or products being offered of value?C. Are the services antrr products being offered priced appropriately?D. Would you in general, classify the environment in which your patients live asone whicL., encourages nutrition faddism?Visit your local bookstores, magazine stands, and supermarkets. Buy arrd readsome of the \"diet\" books being promoted. Look for references to diets in popularmagazines. Assess the quality and quantity of nutrition information available toyour patients via the popular media.3. Prepare a display for your office waiting room, presenting your own set of nutri-tion do's and don'ts. Include a recommended diet book and diet article list andother information which may be used in patient education.a. 1.

Many \"supplements\" and \"c: tts\"are of little or no value and may even be harmful. Peopleneed to ask questions before they select a nutritionproduct or diet. The following questions will help youmake wise decisions.1.Is the evidence based upon a story (personal exper-ience) rather than on scientific studies?2. Has it been proven safe? Don't assume that allnutrition supplements, herbs, and diets are safe.3. What is the motive of the promoter? If profit is theonly motive, \"Watch Out!\"What kind of claims are made? Are they vague andmisleading? Are they based upon testimonials anucase histories? The quack's position is \"Prove I'mwrong\" instead of \"Here is scientific proof that I'mright.\"5. Do experts in the field use it? Would an expertencourage a relative to use the product or diet?6. Does your doctor think the claim makes sense?7. Does it claim that a nutrient, food group, orsupplement is the \"key\" to rapid weight loss? Doesit blame certain foods for causing problems? If so,then look elsewhere.8. Is it a revolutionary idea? This trick has been usedfor years to mislead the public.9. Does it claim 100% success) No product or dietwhich is sound will do so.10.

As many as 30,000 prematuredeaths per year in the U.S. are due to the primary or secondary effects of osteoporosis.The annual cost has been estimated to be $3.8 billion, a figure which is likely to climbsubstantially as the result of r pid increases in the geriatric pcpu!ation.1Although relatively little can be done to reverse osteoporosis once there is an onsetof fractures, there can be a great deal accomplished by focusing on the preventivemeasures effective against this debilitating disease.For a review, sections on the processes which regulate bone metabolism have beenincluded. Throughout this module, an attempt has been made to relate the clinicalprocesses to the underlying physiological and biochemical processes in \"olved in bonemetabolism. GoalThe goal of this module is to encourage the primary care physician to stress to patientsthat osteoporosis is avoidable; however, measures such as adequate daily calciumintake, exercise, and rational drug use need to be instituted as a matter of daily habitearly in life rather than as a short-term treatment once a problem has been diagnosed.Answers will be provided to commonly asked questions regarding bone and teethdevelopment, prevention of osteoporosis and dental caries, and the role of nutrition/diet in maintenance of healthy bones and teeth. ObjectivesUpon completion of this module, you will be able to:1.Discuss normal metabolism and pathological processes of bones and teeth.2.Identify which population groups are at greatest risk for osteoporosis.3.Recognize the need for calcium at various stages of the life cycle and distinguishbetween the needs of males and females.4.Determine when preventive measures should be started to preserve teeth andbones.S.Identify which dietary, drug, and exercise measures are most effective in main-taining teeth and bones.6.Educate patients as t 3 the factors which contribute to the good health of bonesand teeth.7.Counsel patients as to how to obtain the proper amount of calcium in the diet.8.Determine which drugs, diseases, and treatment regimens exacerbate problemswith bones and teeth. 8 Nutrition in Health Promotion Definition of Osteoporosis and the Popu-lation at Risk.CIMMI1IC MIN11.Osteoporosis is the loss of bone mass which results in an increased number of fractures,primarily of the spine, hips, and forearms.ilIIMiMMINIIWMINIOsteoporosis is the most common skeletal disorder inthe world and is characterized by a lowered bone mass,with the remaining bone normally mineralized. Althoughthe osteoporotic process may be slowed or stopped, theexistent damage is irreversible. This malady, osteo-penia, is or.,.. of four subcategories of the loss of bonemass; the other three subcategories are osteomalacia,endocrinopathies, and marrow packing disorders, someof which are reversible.The decrease ;n bone mass due to osteoporosis leads toan increased number of fractures, with the spine, hips,and forearms being mcst susceptible. Spinal compressionfractures after such minor trauma as stepping down froma step, coughing, or receiving an enthusiastic hug arecommon. Different subgroups of osteoporotic individ-uals may have greater or lesser incidence of fractures atvarious bone sites. 1.1===.=10Osteoporosis not only hasan extreme economicimpact, but it also can affect the overall generalhealth of its victims. Thesame factors whichmaintain good bone healthare also responsiblefor maintenance of sound teeth. In the U.S. alone, osteoporosis is implicated in nearly200,000 hip fractures and 100,000 wrist fractures peryear, affecting predominantly women, in particularabout 15-25% of all postmenopausal women. In thespine, th., lower thoracic and upper lumbar regions aremost affected. In addition to being painful and tempo-rarily debilitating, these types of fractures can have long-term consequences (Table 21-1).The lowered thoracic and abdominal volume maylower appetite and decrease lung volume, thereby impair-ing ability to exercise. The yearly costs in the U.S. fromthe acute problems of osteoporosis alone are staggering,in the order of billions of dollars.2 This figure does notinclude requirements for chronic ore, long-term disabil-ity, of lowered quality of life. Table 21-1.Consequences of Osteoporosis1. Reduced stature2. Dowager's hump3. Alteration of rib position leading toa. Lowered thoracic volumeb. Lowered abdominal volume Although osteoporosis does not include strictly dentalproblems such as peridontal disease, the same factorswhich help to maintain strong bones also affect thesoundness of teeth. The calcified tissues in teeth are theenamel, dentin, and cementum. These tissues are moreinfluenced by external factors during the developmentalperiod than after the teeth have erupted. When bones of the jaw deteriorate, however, teeth may loosen andeventually be lost. Thus, throughout this discussion itshould be borne in mind that the discussion also appliesto teeth. Because of the pervasiveness of osteoporosis, itis important to understand the mechanisms for thedevelopment of the disease and the pre% entive measureswhich may be taken to reduce or eliminate the problem.11=11= 11111MMIMMMISusceptibility to osteoporosis may be related topeak bone mass which is attained at approxi- mately age 35 in bothsexes. ANNIIIMMBone mineral mass peaks at roughly ag, 35 for bothsexes and declines at a greater rate for females than formales; it is particularly accelerated after menopause. Themajor determinant for osteoporosis in old age may be thepeak bone mass attained early in adult life.' Therefore,measures aimed at preventing osteoporosis should bedirected not only at the older segments of the populationbut also at children and young adults who have not yetattained peak bone mass. Factors affecting peak bonemass will be discussed in various sections of this module.Bone Composition and StructureBones are 65% mineral, with a calcium and phosphorus crystal type callek hydroxyapatitebeing the majorcomponent. There are two Protecting Bone aril Teeth 3 types of bone in the skeleton, tubular andcancellous, and it is the cancellous type which issubject to osteoporosis.11=1111111MY11=Bone is composed of minerals, water, and an organicmatrix consiLting of 95% collagen and 5% cxtracellularfluid and mucoprotein. The mineral component of bone(65% of total weight) is composed mostly of hydrox-yapatite, CA,0(1)04),(OH)2; amorphous cal-cium types like octacalcium phosphate, CA81-12(PO4)H205. Of the approximately 600 gm of phosphorus in theadult human, 85% of it is in the skeleton. Teeth containsimilar types of crystals, but the percentages of each typevary in the three kinds of calcified tissue of the teeth.The skeleton has two kinds of bonetubular andcancellous. Tubular bone has a cortex and a fewunderlying trabeculae (bone spicules or the fibrousframework) and is found predominantly in the appen-dicular skeleton. Cancellous or spongy bone, on the otherhand, has a thin cortex: numerous trabeculae providesupport. Cancellous bone is found mostly in the axialskeleton in the spine, in the head and neck of the femur,and in the distal radius. It is the cancellous bone which ispreferentially subject to osteoporosis. Radiologists canquantitate the degree of bone loss by the Singh index,which is based upon the disappearance of trabeculaefrom the neck and head of the femur.4 However, up to30% bone loss may occur before overt losses can bedetected radiographically. Tooth formation begins in utero, with cal-cification beginning at .S months of gestation.The final stages of tooth development occur inthe early twenties with the eruption of thewisdom teeth. A number of factors can influence the health of a toothlong before the tooth actually erupts above the gum line.The tooth buds form in utero at 4-6 weeks of gestation.Calcification of the teeth begins at S months ofgestation. After birth, the permanent teeth begin tocalcify as early as 4-6 months of age, even though theeruption of these teeth does not occur until approxi-mately 6 years of age; the process continues until theearly twenties with the eruption of the wisdom teeth.Proper tooth development requires adequate dietaryintake of calcium, phosphorus, protein, and otheressential minerals. Vitamin A deficiency in utero mayresult in inadequately developed tooth enamel, a circum-stance which leaves teeth more susceptible to decay later.Vitamin D deficiency delays tooth eruption and results inpitted, thin, or absent tooth enamel. Vitamin C defi-ciency impairs collagen formation and compromises thehealth of the gums.Tooth decay (dental caries) occurs when bacteriametabolic food stuck to the surfaces of the teeth produc-ing organic acids which destroy the tooth enamel. Anewly erupted tooth has the greatest susceptibility todevelopment of caries. The frequency of caries can bereduced by1. brushing teeth after eating and using doss daily,2. avoiding sugar-containing snacks unless toothbrushing follows promptly,3. avoiding sticky foods such as caramels which holdcarbohydrate-containing fonds next to the teeth,4. rinsing the mouth with warm water if brushingcannot be accomplished immediately,S. drinking fluoridated water or using a fluoridatedrinse with the advice of a dentist, and6. having regular dental check-ups and professionaltooth cleaning.Another problem that can affect teeth in young chil-dren is the \"nursing bottle\" syndrome. Persons who puttheir children to bed with a bottle of milk or fruit juicemay encounter this problem which leads to massivedecay of the upper flora teeth. As the child falls asleep,saliva production ceases and the milk or juice poolsaround the front top teeth. Bacterial growth withresultant acid production ther occurs, promoting cariesin the upper teeth. The lower teeth, protected by thetongue, are seldom involved. The practice of puttinginfants to bed with a bottle should be discouraged.Further, soft drinks or other high-sugar drinks should notconstitute part of a diet for an infant. Osteoblasts are involved in bone formation;osteoclasts are active in bone resorption; andosteocytes are resting bone cells embedded in themineral matrix. In order to understand the factors that result information and maintenance of strong, fracture-resistant .1111MMOMMI=11111011M111Nutrition in Health Promotion bones, it is first necessary to examine processes involvedin metabolic bone formation. An excellent two -partreview has appeared recently.\" The process will beexamined only briefly here.The major functioning cells of bone (osteoblasts,osteoclasts, and osteocytes) originate from a commonmesenchymal stem cell. Their functions are summarizedin Table 21-2.Together osteoblasts and osteoclasts constitute 95%of the bone cells. Osteoblasts have several importantroles in bone formation. Procollagen is hydroxylation osteoblasts, procollagenis attacked by a protease to form collagen which is thenformed into fibrils stabilized by lime- and intermole-cular crosslinks. Mineralization can then occur. Osteo-blasts are also responsible for synthesizing other proteinsimportant to the bone matrix, such as a calcit:m-bindingprotein, osteocalcin (whose synthesis is vit amin K- andvitamin D-dependent), and osteonectin (a phosphopro-tein capable calcium). Asnew bone matrixisbuilt,the osteoblasts becomeembedded in the bone and become resting cells or osteo-cytes. The final type of cells important to bone strengthare the osteoclasts; time are involved in bone resorption.They are multinucleated cells which secrete proteolyticenzymes and organic acids (citrate and lactate) which areinvolved in the breakdown of existing bone. Teeth, ofcourse, have the added insult of organic acids, such asthose produced by bacteria in plaque, which erode theteeth from the surface. Bone synthesis and remodelling are constLatprocesses.Through cell processes, communication among bonecells is maintained. There are two modes of osteogenesis:endochondral, wherein new bone develops from previ-ously formed cartilage; and membranous, wherein newbone arises from connective tissue rather than cartilage.A reasonably constant bone mass is maintained by care-fully balancing the relative activities of osteoblasts andosteoclasts. It is important to remember that bone is aliving tissue which is constantly synthesized and re-modelled. Regulation of Bone Formation and Re-modellingA number of regulatory factors are involved in theoverall control of bone formation and remodelling. Thetypes of factors involved are listed in Table 21-3.Mechanisms must also exist to mediate effects of exerciseand stress on bone. Hcw these are mediated, however, isnot at all clear. MM..-.111MMIIMOne of the body's very crucial needs is to main-tain serum calcium levels within a narrowrange. As the major pool of calcium, bones playan active role in the maintenance of serumcalcium levels. Although bone growth and remodelling are importantto structural integrity, the larger and more importantrole is that of providing calcium homeostasis.Serum calcium levels are tightly maintained between 9and 11 mg% (4.5-5.5 mEq /l) and excursions in eitherdirection result in death. Therefore, it is necessary for thebody to have a multiplicity of acute and chronic regula- 21-2.Formation and Degradation of BoneCell which have becomeembedded in bone matrixSecrete proteolytic enzymesSecrete organic acids 11 Protecting Bone and Teeth 5 Table 21-3.Regulators of Bone Formationand Bone-derived growth factor tory mechanisms to ensure that bone, which is the majorpool of body calcium (99% or 1200-1400 gm in a typi-cal adult human), is maintained at a reasonably constantlevel. Half of the calcium in blood is present as \"free\"calcium (1mM), and half is bound to small molecules orplasma proteins. Calcium plays a role in muscle contrac-tion, nerve conduction, and hormone secretion by coup-ling an appropriate stimulus with calcium mobilizationin the secreting cell and intracellular communication;therefore, it is necessary that regulation of changes in themineral composition of bone be intimately connected tothe physiological processes in the rest of the body.Because maintenance of stable calcium levels is socrucial to life, it seems reasonable that a number ofregulatory processes and tissues should be involved in theoverall control of calcium metabolism. Intake and ex-cretion of calcium contribute to overall calcium balance,and there is considerable turnover of calcium throughoutthe body (calcium in extracellular fluid turns overbetween 40 and 50 times a day). In 'aver and heart theturnover is six times a day; in skeletal muscle the turn-over is twice a year. While 50-00 gm of calcium in bone isreadily exchangeable, the total bone turnover of calciumis on the order of 3%/year. Clearly, if the turnoverprocessis not balanced, a significant loss of boneminerals can occur, even in as short a period as 10 years.An overall description of the regulation of calcium levelsis shown in Table 21-4.Table calcium, indicates a 1,.11 Effects of Parathyroid HormoneParathyroid serum calcium levelsby calcium, and of 1,25 dihydroxy-cholecalci ferol.MI=MEMIMIr.Parathyroid hormone is responsible for maintainingadequate levels of serum calcium. The hormone is re-leased from the Parathyroid glands as the precursorhormone, proparathyroid hormone (proPTH, 94aa) orparathyroid hormone (PTH). Additional proteolyticmodification of PTH takes place in various peripheraltissues. Release of PTH is stimulated by a fall in caiciumor a rise in the antagonistic hormone, calcitonin, whichwillbe discussed later. PTH fun ions by severalmechanisms: it stimulates bone resorption, reabsorptionof calcium and synthesis of dihy-droxycholecalciferol [1,25 (OH)2D3] which evaluatesintestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and itselfstimulates bone resorption.The effects of PTH on the kidney are likely mediatedvia adenylate cyclase-cyclic AMP but, in addition,require the presence of calcium. PTH has a very rapidJ2 6 Nutrition in Health Promotion Table 21-5.

It individuals withPTH-secreting tumors, there is a rise in blood calciuciivi'lich cannot be effectively treated by diet. Treatmentissues will be discussed later. The role of PTH is sum-marized in Table 21-5. Effects of CalcitoninSteAIMMIN=M111- 1111WCalcitonin is responsiole for lowering serumcalcium by stimulating bone and cal-cium and phosphate excretion. Calcitonin, which lowerf serum calcium levels, issecreted from the parafollicular cells ,f the thyroid glandai.4is known as thyrocalcitonin in older literature.Support of the notion that calcitonin plays a role inoverall calcium metabolism comes from the observationtat people with calcitonin-secreting tumors have hyper-plastic parathyroid glands. Further, calcitonin levels areaffected by dietary calcium intake; the k 'els rise when acalcium-rich meal is fed after a fast. Young animals areapparently more sensitive to calcitonin than olderanimals, making it tempting to speculate that calcitonininsensitivity may play a role of osteoporosis. ,:alcitoninrapidly decreases the number of ostcoclasts and theamounts of lactate and citrate produced by the o teo-cytes. It also increases the ability of the osteoblastr, tosynthesize collagen matrix necessary for mineralization.Paradoxically, calcitonin lowers the actual number ofosteoblasts. This may explain is effectivein Paget's disease, a pathologic bone resorption condi-tion, for only a short period of time. Like PTH,calcitonin elevates urinary phosphate excretion and alsoincreases calcium excretion. This is consistent with itslowering plasma calcium, bui. this part of its actioncounteracts its contribution to bone mineralization. Therole of calcitonin is summarized in Table 21 -S. Effects of Vitamin DVitamin D has become a required nutrient be-cause of our lifestyle. It is converted to its activeform in a series of reactions to 1,25 dihydroxy-cholecalciferol [1,25(OH)2D3]. Vitamin D has been said to be a hormone which ourlifestyle has made into a vitamin. Under conditions ofadequate exposure to sunlight, vitamin D can be com-pletely synthesized endogenously, travel to a target tissuevia the bloodstream, and exert its actions in minutequant; tiesall of the qualifications of a hormone. TheRecommended Dietary Allowance for vitamin D isshown in Table 21-6.13 Protecting Bone and Teeth Table 21-6 Infants Children Males Females PregnantLactatingCalcium, Phosphorus, and I.U. of vitamin D.Adapted from Food Science and Nutrition Board, Nat.onal Academy of SuenLesNational Research Council Recommended DietaryAllowances,Revised 1980. Vitamin D is an excellent example of the interaLtionof a variety of tissues and regula ory mechanisms. Thesynthetic scheme for the active form of vitamin D isshown in Figure 21-1. Disease in any of the tissuesinvolved in the synthesis and conversions of vitamin Dshould be expected to contribute to osteoporosis. Forexample, renal disease can prevent adequate formationof 1,25 (OH)2D3 or other metabolites, and diarrhea mayprevei., adequate calcium absorpr on, even in the presenceof sufficient vitamin D. High plasma calcium concentra-tions inhibit the 1-hydroxylase enzyme, and PTH may berequired for the synthesis of the 1-hydroxylase. Anothervitamin D metabolite is also formed by the kidney24,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol. Only the 1,25 formstimulates uptake of calcium oy the intestine, but bothforms can stimulate mobilization of bone calcium. It ispossible that the 24,25 hydroxylated form may beinvolved in feedback inhibition of PTH Whenthere is adequate calcium, hydroxylation in the 24position dominates; when calcium reserves are low, the 1position is preferentially Iv, droxylated. There is a thirdmetabolite, 1,24,25 (OH)3D3, whose role is still unclear.It may be a form of the vitamin marked for excretion bythe liver. The role of vitamin D is summarized in Table21-5. Rickets in children and osteomalacia in adultscan be prevented by adequate vitamin D andphosphate, or by 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol[1,25(OH)2D3]. Use of certain anticonvulsantsor antibiotics may increase the risk of rickets. Without adequate vitamin D, bone mineralization isincomplete, causing rickets in children or osteomalaciain adults. There is hypocalcemia and often secondaryhyperparathyroidism.

Teeth which are formed during a period of ricketsare abnormally calcified,leading to a greater incidence of caries in later life.Fortunately, vitamin D 0-ficiency rickets is now rare inWestern societies. Theie are, however, vitamin D-resistant forms of rickets which may respond to acombined treatment of vitamin D and phosphate supple-mentation or to the addition of 1,25 (OH)2D3. This maybe accomplished with Calciferol, available in 50,000USP unittablets or 500,000 USP,' - inoilin-jections. This compound should not be given J patientswith hypercalcemia or evidence of vitamin D toxicity,such as weakness, headache, vomiting, muscle or bonepain, loss of appetite, hypertension, or cardiac arrhyth-mias. Several types of phosphate supplements are availa-ble, but they may cause vomiting or diarrhea. In somecases, such as in children or adults receiving certainanticonvu 'sant drugs (e.g., phenytom) osteomalacia ma/develop as the result of stimulation of the ei.zymesysiem responsible for vitamin D breakdown. These drugsshould be used in the lowest effective dosages possibleand for the shortest time periods neteled to producetherapeutic effects. Certain antibiotics, such as tetracy-cline, may tie up calcium in the gastrointe-tinal tra,t.Chronic renal disease may also precipitate bone loss as aconsequence of failure to hydroxylate 25(OH)D3 to1,25 (OH)2D3 in the kidney. There may ofthe 25(OH)D3 form or other v'tamin D metaboliteswhich themselves may interfere 'ith normal calciumhomeostasis. Likewise, liver disorders may result in alack of sufficient hydroxylation in the 25 position to form the 25(0' ) intermediate. There are some condi-tions which may be confused with rickets.' Usually,however, there is some method for differentiating otherdisorders from rickets (see Table 21-7).

Bone demineralization may occurin diabetic metabolic acidosis. Another group of hormones which affects bonemetabolism are those hormones which ordinarily reg-ulate nutrient homeostasis.' Among these are insulin,growth hormone, thyroid hormone, the sex steroids, andglucocorticoids. Some of the actions of these hormone_son bone may be secondary or tertiary to their impact or.other target tissues, and certainly many of their inter-actions with bone are not well understood. For example,in insulin deficiency in children, there is generalizedgrowth retardation, but it is not clear whether the effectis e-_of generalized nutrient deficiency or whether thereare more direct actions on bone cells. Since insulin isknown to alter intracellular calcium pools in some cells,it is also possible that insulin could affect bone calciumdistribution in a direct way. Bone demineralization mayoccur during periods of metabolic acidosis in diabetics.The goal for such patients should be to prevent ketosisand acidosis by maintaining good blood glucose control.(See the Guide Index for other modules which outlinedietary strategies for the diabetic.) Effects of Growth Hormone-Growth hormone is necessary for bone growth,and insufficiency leads to reduced stature and perhaps to sexual immaturity. Excesses areequally detrimental, producing gigantism in theyoung and acromegaly in adults.10111.1111=MMEffects of growth hormone on bone are direct,producing dose responses in bone growth. Lack of thehormone during developmental periods leads to a failureto achieve full stature (dwarfism), while excesses duringthis period result in abnormal excess growth (gigantism).Pituitary dwarfism is the result of the failure of thepituitary to produce growth hormone, either as part ofan overall lack of hormones from the pituitary (panhy-popituitarism) or as a particular deficiency of growthhormone (sexual ateliotic d iarfism). Those with panhy-popituitarism will not mature sexually and will showsigns of hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency. Lackof only growth hormone, however, impairs attainmentof full stature and not sexual maturity. After fusion ofthe epiphyseal plates, additional bone growth is limitedto areas of responsive cartilage such as the jaw, hands,and feet, leading to the characteristic deformities ofacromegaly. The effects of growth hormone on bone areapparently mostly on calcification and chondrogenesiswithout speeding up the bone maturation process and thefusion of the epiphyseal prates. It is generally believedthat growth hormone exerts its actions on bone I, la thesomatomedins, among which isinsulin-like growthfactor I. Effects of Thyroid Hormone111111Hypothyroidism slows bone turnover whilehyperthyroidism increases bone turnover andleads to negative calcium and phosphatebalances. Thyroid hormone appears to have dramatic inter-actions with bone. In hypothyroidism bone turnover isslowed, while in hyperthyroidism it is increased. Duringdevelopment, hypothyroidism leads to impairment ofskeletal growth. Bone resorption by osteoclasts has beenshown to occur in vitro in response to thyroid hormone.There are associated increases in serum calcium and a decrease in PTH and 1,25 (OH)2D3, as would beexpected. Cartilage growth may be stimulated. Unlikegrowth hormone, thyroid hormone promotes bonematuration. Excesses of thyroid hormone lead to nega-tive calcium and phosphate balances and to decreasedabsorption from the intestine. Hyperthyroid patientsshould be monitored closely to determine that they arereceiving adequate dietary calcium. Effects of Sex HormoneAndrogens and estrogens are involved in bonematuration and fusion of the epiphyseal plates.111111Clearly, the sex steroids (androgen and estrogens)must also be involved in skeletal maturation and main-tenance. Skeletal size of males is usually greater than171 Protecting Bone and Teeth 11 females, while the female skeleton provides a necessaryreserve of calcium to support pregnancy and lactation.Further, in postmenopausal women there is a dramaticloss of bone mass which can be slowed by estrogensupplementation(discussedingreater fusion of the epiphyseal plates. The mechanismsof action of these hormones are unknown. It has beenpostulated that part of the androgen effect is duesecondarily to increased muscle mass, which seems tofavor increased bone mass. Other effects may be medi-ated by changes in calcium absorption from the intestine,alterations in 1,25 (OH)2D3 synthesis, or stimulation ofcalcitonin secretion in order to inhibit bone resorption.Androgens have been used to promote bone healing inaging patients, but their effects are short-term. Besidesproducing virilism in patients, androgens maycause hepatic dysfunction. will be discussedlater in this module. Effects of GlucocorticoidsGlucocorticoid effects on bone are beneficial atphysiological concentrations but detrimental athigh concentrations. The effects of glucocorticoids depend upon th, con-centrations; i.e., whether they are present in physiologi-cal or pharmacological amounts. In excess, the glucocor-ticoids diminish calcium and phosphate uptake from theintestine and increase their excretion from the kidney.There is increased bone turnover and a precipitous dropin the number of osteoblasts at sites of new bone forma-tion resulting in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.Patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy for adult res-piratory distress syndrome, organ transplants, or neo-plastic diseases may all experience incr sed bone turn-over as a result of the high glucocorticoid levels. Atnormal concentrations, however, the glucocorticoidshave beneficial effects on skeletal growth. At normalconcentrations, there is actually a period of stimulationof bone collagen synthesis by glucocorticoids in bonecultures. Glucocorticoid effects may be mediated byregulation of differentiation of the y arious types of bonecells. Patients receiving drugs such as prednisone may8need to follow a low-sodium, low-simple-carbohydratediet and try to avoid gaming weight. When pharma-cological doses are necessary for a long course of therapy,calcium supplementatioo may to be in order. Effects of Paracrine FactorsBone itselfproduces factorswhich, actinglocally, alter its own metabolism. The final group of hormones/factors which help toregulate bone formation and turnover may operate in aparacrine rather than a hormonal fashion. Prostaglan-dins (PGE series) are potent stimulators of bone resorp-tion. In some bone tumors, there is an elevated produc-tion of prostaglandins, which leads to hypercalcemia andconsiderable resorption in the region of the tumor.Factors in blood cells may play a role in the regulationof bone metabolism. One of these is the osteoclast-activating factor derived from proliferating lympho-cytes. In vitro it stimulates bone resorption and inhibitscollagen synthesis. This may account for the hypercal-cemia associated with such discases as myeloma.Mithramycin IV (Mithracin), an antineoplastic agent,may be considered for treating such patients in a hospitalsetting. With such treatment, calcium balance mayreturn to normal rather quickly. Treatment by lowdietary calcium is not recommended.Since bone remodelling occurs in response to mechani-cal stress, a local phenomenon, local factors must exist tomediate the changes. These factors may be related also tothe somatomedins. One factor, bone growth factor II,has been reported to stimulate synthesis of new cells andmatrix in cartilage cultures.' Although these factors maybe derived from other tissues as well, current data seem toindicate that they can arise from cells in the bone. A greatdeal of additional research must occur before the roles ofthese factors are clarified.Clearly, bone growth and remodelling is acomplicated process involving not only bone tissueitself but also many other body tissues. Impairmentin any of these other tissues may be expected tocause anomalies in the turnover of bone. If a severeenough imbalance is created, then osteoporosis willbe the ultimate result. 12 Nutrition in Health Promotion Risk Factors For Osteoporosis Although osteoporosis may be a natural con-sequence of aging, the degree of osteoporosis is afunction of peak bone mass attained in earlyadulthood. Much of the osteoporosis commonly seen is age-re-lated, but must it be an inevitable part of the agingprocess? Evidence indicates that bone loss, particularly inwomen, begins in the third decade of life, althoughincreased fracture risk may not become apparent untilages 60-70. If bone loss occurs as early as age 30, perhapsthere are some preventive measures which can beemployed to delay the onset of loss or to avoid it entirely.It is generally believed that the degree of subsequent boneloss is a function of peak bone mass attained in earlyadulthood. Prudence would seem to indicate that actionsshould be taken to ensure reaching the geneticallydetermined maximum bone mass. The ideal time todiscuss the prevention of osteoporosis with femalepatients is during the yearly female exam. Postmenopausal women of western Europeanextraction most often develop osteoporosis.Also at risk are women who have had anoophorectomy at an early age, women who haveexcessive alcohol intake, cigarette smokers, andthose who lead a sedentary life style. Seemingly at greatest risk of osteoporosis are post-menopausal, fair-complexioned women of westernEuropean descent. Approximately 15% of the post-menopausal women in the U.S. will develop osteoporo-sis. The incidence in black women is very much lower.8These data would seem to indicate a genetic componentfor the disease which isseparate from nutritionalconsiderations. There does, however, seem to be acorrelationof development of osteoporosis withlowered calcium intake. National dietary surveys haveindicated that 66% of U.S. women have calcium intakesbelow the RDA in the years when peak bone mass isattained, and that 75% of older women have inadequatecalcium intakes. islcks generally have lower calciumintakes than whites. In comparing osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic women of the same ages, the osteoporoticgroups had lower calcium intakes during a period of timeprior to the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Retrospectivestudies have indicated that excessive alcohol intake,cigarette smoking, and sedentary lifestyles are associateddirectly or indirectly with osteoporosis in later life.9While no causality can be implied by these studies, it isnot difficult to suppose, for example, that excess alcoholcould cause liver or intestinal damage, which in turnmight interfere with vitamin D metabolism and calciumuptake. Other factors known to be capable of precipi-tating osteoporosis are the chronic use of anticonvulsantdrugs, such as phenytoin, and long-term antacid abuseleading to hyporhosphatemia.Prevention of OsteoporosisDietary CalciumDietary calcium is best supplied by dairy pro-ducts; but for reasons of economics, foodpreferences, or intolerances, it may be difficultfor many people to obtain an adequate amountof calcium from dietary sources.Iik.IIII.s.The best ways to prevent osteoporosis and to treat thedisease, once it is evident, are controversial. A number ofstudies indicate life-long patterns of less-than-adequatecalcium intake resulting in osteoporosis. In general, menconsume nearly twice as much calcium as women, andwomen have the added drain on their calcium supplies ofpregnancy and lactation.'\u00b0 The recommended dietaryallowances for calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D fordifferent age groups are given in Table 21-6. Duringpregnancy, there is elevated calcium absorption andperhaps even positive calcium balance, with the addi-tional calcium being deposited in the mother's bones.During lactation, there is an additional requirement forcalcium and phosphorus because of the losses of theseconstituents to the milk. Calcium balance during periodsof lactation is usually negative.Intake of calcium is also a function of economic level,since foods that contain the largest amounts of calciumtend to be those which are more expensive. Concernsabout calorie intake, ethnic eating patterns, or foodintolerance may prevent some individuals from receivingadequate calcium. Food ckices of various ethnic groupswere discussedin Module 1, Nutrient Content ofFoods, Nutritional Supplements, and Food Fallacies.In older people there may be a loss of appetite orstrong food dislikes which can impinge un food choices. <o 9 Protecting Bone and Teeth 13 Many older people think milk is only for babies, othersmay think dairy products are \"harmful\" because of thecholesterol content. Still others think that cheese causesconstipation. Lactose intolerance can contribute tolowered intakes of high-calcium dairy products, butlactose intolerance is found most often in oriental andblack populations who are not at particular risk forosteoporosis. Even in lactose-intoler,.nt persons, ade-quate calcium can be obtained by ingestion of fermenteddairy products. The calcium contents of some commonfoods are shown in Table 21-8. Pasteurization orhomogenization of milk does not lower ,:,e availabilityof calcium. Calcium availability is redu,ed in foods withhigh oxalate levels (soybeans, kale, ctc.) and in foods Table 21-8.ITEMCalcium Content of Common Foods Milk, skim, whole, 2%Milkshake, homemadeMilk, or Module 8, Normal Diet: Geriatrics.SERVING CONTENT (mg) 8 oz 3008 2852 oz 5502 oz oz oz 3501/2 cup 75 8 oz 4151 cup 170Vz cup 135 1 medium piece 1451 cup 360 2 oz 1702 oz 1507 - 9 115 1/2 cup 180V2 cup 1001 Tbsp 1351 cup 90 2() 14 Nutrition in Health Promotion with high phosphate levels, such as unpolished rice andbran. A general rule of thumb is to divide the amount ofcalcium in foods from these sources by 2 to get thequantity of calcium actually available for absorption. Dietary Phosphorus61911. AMMOIn animal studies, the Ca/P ratio has beenfound to be important to normal growth andmaintenance of the skeleton. It has been sug-gested that a Ca/P ratio of 1, or a little greater,should be optimal in humans. Along with dietary calcium intake, phosphorus intakemust be taken into consideration. In animals it has beenshown that excess phosphorus or low amounts of dietarycalcium relative to phosphorus result in skeletal defects.In humans, however, there is little evidence that this isthe case and even some evidence that calcium balancemay be improved by elevated phosphorus intakes. Thereis an inverse relationship between dietary phosphorusand urinary calcium. This results in elevated PTH andincreased bone resorption. It has been suggested that aCa/P ratio of 1, or a little greater, would be ideal, butthis is difficult to achieve by dietary means alone. In theU.S., consumption of phosphate is rising. Cola drinkscontain large amounts of phosphate (12-20 mg%).Phosphates, including orthophosphate (for acidifica-don), and di- and pclyphosphates are frequently used asfood additives.' Dairy products have only marginallymore calcium than phosphate. Processed cheese, on theother hand, actually has more phosphate than calcium.Meat which is rich in phosphorus is consumed 31% morenow than 20 years ago, while dairy product consumptionis down 37%. Ithas been shown\" that lacto-ovovegetarians have a greater bone mass than omnivores.Since meat is high in phosphates and since this type ofvegetarian uses dairy products having a Ca/P ratio ofabout 1, this lends credence to the hypothesis that abalance between calcium and phosphate is beneficial.Most of the dietary phosphorus is absorbed as freephosphate. With normal intakes of phosphorus, ab-sorption efficiency is 60-70%; this may be lowered when1 significant amount of dietary phosphate is obtainedfrom cereals and seeds which contain phytate, an organicester of phosphate which is not readily digestible (see alsothe section \"Drugs and Calcium Absorption\").Age and Calcium AbsorptionIn young people who are still growing, theefficiency of dietary calcium absorption is 75%,but it drops to 30-60% in adults. Calcium absorption declines with age, so an addi-tional complicating factor is involved. In actively grow-ing children, about 75% of the available dietary calciumis absorbed; in adults on a normal diet, this figure maydrop to 30-60%. Thus, even in calcium- adequate dietsthere may be a reduced uptake of available calcium.Some of the reduction in absorption may be due toreduced circulating levels of 1,25(OH)2D3. It has beenpostulated that there is a mild, compensatory para-thyroid-mediated bone loss with aging. Other hypothesessuggest that overall bone loss is a function of imbalancebetween formation and resorption of bone caused byphysical inactivity or steroid deficiency.Another contributing factor to decreased calciumabsorption may be the amount of dietary fiber. Althoughbelieved to have beneficial effects on lowering serumlipid levels and preventing gastrointestinal tract prob-lems, fiber can effectively bind minerals such as calcium.For a review, see the recent work by Heany et al.\"Long-term studies have not been performed to determinewhether the fiber content of diets might have seriousconsequencesfor calcium balance. The apparentmechanism for the bone loss would dictate the mostefficacious treatment. Total vegetarians may havelowered bone mass (as opposed to lacto-ovo vegetarianswho have been shown to have elevated bone mass),\" andmay refuse calcium supplements as \"unnatural.\" Theirrigid exclusion of dairy products from the diet may beextended to their children as well. These patients shouldhe counseled about the short- and long-term hazards ofthese dietary practices, both for themselves and especiallyfor their children. Fortunately, it is relatively easy for anadolescent to meet the RDA for calcium because foodssuch as cheese pizza, cheeseburgers, yogurt, milkshakes,etc. find high acceptability in this age group. Drugs and Calcium Absorption Laxatives and antacid abuse are common causesof poor calcium absorption. 21 Protecting Bone and Teeth 15 There are a number of commonly used prescriptionand over-the-counter preparations which may interferewith calcium uptake or metabolism. antacid (aluminum hydroxide-containingantacids such as Maalox, turn could precipitate osteomalacia. The condition isreversible when the abuse ceases and phosphorus isrepleted. Heavy antacid use may be the result of self-medication, but it is also seen in patients with ulcers or inthose receiving glucocorticoid when it is administered toreduce the risk of ulcers.12 The practice of taking theseantacids shortly after eating undoubtedly reduces phos-phorus availability. Furthermore, much of the dietaryphosphorus may be present as phytate, which is availableonly after hydrolysis. The activity of the intestinalenzyme (phytase) responsible for this reaction is believedto be dependent upon vitamin D. Other drugs, such ascellulose phosphate, an ion exchange resin, bind calciumitself. Similar findings have been reported for cho-lestyramine resins. Long-term use of colestipol, a bileacid s2questrant, may also change serum calcium levels,perhaps by altering vitamin D absorption. Since calciumis more readily absorbed in an acidic rather than in analkaline environment, patients with achlorhydria alsohave lowered calcium absorption.Laxative abuse may limit calcium absorption, perhapsby decreasing transit time of nutrients in the gut.Phenolphthalein, a common laxative, has been reportedto be associated with osteomalacia.12 Drugs which have atoxic effect on the mucosal cell lining would all beexpected to have effects of varying severity on calciumand phosphate uptake, depending upon the degree ofdamage to the mucosal lining. The drugs which interferewith calcium absorption are summarized in Table 21-9.For patients receiving these treatments, adequate calciumintake should be ensured. If dietary Intake is inadequate,then supplements should be used.Calcium can have an adverse effect on the absorptionof certain drugs as vy O. One of the most notable cases istetracycline, which combines with calcium to form anonabsorbable complex. Further, use of tetracyclineduring the last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood(to age 8) may result in a child's having permanentlymottled teeth that are extremely susceptible to decay.Some antibiotics such as penicillin, chloramphenicol,and neomycin, however, actually Supplementation Calcium from several types of supplements isreadily available, but calcium carbonate sup-plements provide the highest percentage ofcalcium, by weight. The easiest way to provide additional calcium, besidesrational food choices, is by exogenous supplementation.Not all supplements provide the same amount of calciumby weight. The amount of calcium in various prepara-tions is shown in Table 21-10.Calcium carbonate provides the highest percentage ofcalcium per weight of pill. This may be an importantconsideration when there is a need to provide consider-able supplemental calcium. All of the preparations areabout equally absorbable and comparable to the absorp-tion of calcium from milk. Dairy products have theadvantage, however, of having an optimal ratio of Ca/P.These supplements should be taken throughout the dayalong with a small amount of milk or yogurt, both ofwhich contain vitamin D and lactose which promote theabsorption of calcium from the gastrointestinal tract. 22 16 Nutrition in Health Promotion Table 21-10.PreparationCalcium Content of Common Supplements% of Calcium absorption31%Contains other elements may becontaminated with toxic metals22%Ingredient in several antacids; couldbe contaminated with toxic metals 21=rmi. IIMMEmmaINISAt levels of calcium ingestion of greater than 2.5gm/day, there may be calcification of softtissues, hypercalciuria, hypercalcemia, and for-mation of urinary calculi. Calcium does not appear to be toxic in the concentra-tions likely to be ingested, but it is possible to consumeenough to produce side effects. These include hyper-calcemia; hypercalciuria; calcification of the soft tissues,including the kidney and walls; formation ofurinary calculi; and supression of bone remodelling.Under normal circumstances, these would not be aproblem until consumption is greater than 2.5 gm/day.In patients on chronic renal dialysis, however, normalcalcium homeostasis is greatly impaired; so strict atten-tion must be paid to calcium balance. Vitamin D may begiven to enhance calcium utilization. Another group ofpatients at risk are those with ulcers who drink largequantities of milk and consume similarly large quantitiesof antacids. not a recommended treatment modality.They may develop milk alkali syndrome which presentsitself as hypercalcemia and alkalosis.Fluoride Supplementation11.Treatment of osteoporosis with combinedfluoride and calcium therapy has provedbeneficial.Fluoride use has been suggested because it stimulatesbone formation and has been reported to increase bonemass in osteoporotic pat ients.\" Fluoride is incorporatedinto bone as a substitute f. r the hydroxyl groups inhydroxyapatite. Levels of 50mg NaF/day, plus 1 gm ofcalcium as calcium carbonate, have been used thera-peutically. Some clinicians recommend lower doses forbetter tolerance. Sodium fluoride is available as apresLription. Ongoing studies and various biases do notallow us to recommend one standard dose at this time.Further, some epidemiological evidence\" supports thenotion that adequate fluoride intake reduces the inci-dence of osteoporosis. Since fluoride alone may causedefective bone mineralization, it has been suggested thatcalcium supplementation be an integral part of fluoridetherapy. In some cases, fluoride therapy has beenassociated with rheumatic symptoms (joint pain andswelling), gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting,blood loss anemia, and ulcers), or combinations of both.The amount of fluoride which is absorbable dependsupon the degree of hardness of the local water supply.Hard water leads to the formation of insoluble calcium-fluoride complexes, thereby lowering fluoride absorp-tion. Supplemental fluoride is currently recommendedonly in the therapy of osteoporosis, not in prevention.The average diet contains 0.2 - 0.6 mg fluoride/day.\"Diets high in seafoods or tea provide additionalamounts. Fluoridated water is the best source of fluorideand is completely safe in the amounts currently added tothe water supply. 23 10=11111Protecting Bone and Teeth 17 Fluoridated water consumed during the periodbefore tooth eruption provides the greatestprwecti6.; against dental caries. 011111WAIIIIMI 4.1=11It has long been known that fluoride consumed duringtooth development provides protection against dentalcaries once the teeth have erupted. Fluoride concentra-tions in the water of greater than 1 ppm produce thisprotective effect. Excessive fluoride (greater than 3 ppmin water) consumed during periods of tooth develop-ment, however, results in a mottled appearance of thetooth enamel. Topical fluoride applied after the teethhave erupted is less effective. Since developed teeth havelimited ability to repair themselves and virtually nocommunication with systemic circulation, the environ-ment of the mouth is more important in considering anypotential effects of topical or ingested fluoride. It may bepossible, however, that fluoride interferes with themetabolism of the oral bacteria rendering them lesscariogenic.Vitamin D Supplementation=!..If vitamin D is used in the treatment ofosteoporosis, it should be done with cautionbecause of the potential toxic effects. Vitamin D status obviously impacts on osteoporosistreatment. Dietary sources of the vitamin are foundnaturally in oily fish, eggs, liver, and fortified productssuch as milk, which is required by law to have 10\u00b5g /qt(400 IU/qt). The average daily intake in the U.S. isbetween 4 and 6/4g. Studies of the vitamin D status in theolder segments of the population are sketchy.\" Re-quirements in the elderly have not been clearly defined.Some studies have been unable to show a beneficial effectof vitamin D supplementation on reducing osteoporoticfractures. Vitamin D is stored in fatty tissue and canbuild up to toxic levels, resulting in elevated serumcalcium and nephrocalcinosis. This led investigators tosuggest that since vitamin D supplements could result intoxic doses and since hypercalcemia and hypercalciuriahave been observed with vitamin D supplementation,vitamin D should not be used therapeutically.\"' Otherpractitioners include vitamin D (400-800 IU/day) in acombined treatment regimen with fluoride (0.1 mg/kgbodyweight) and calcium (1500 mg/day).\" If a vitaminD supplement is used, it would seem wise to use a dosesimilar to the RDA, which is 400 IU/day. Estrogen SupplementationEstrogen therapy for osteoporosis should beused only with caution and is most effectiveimmediately after the onset of menopause. Estrogen therapy begun soon after the onset ofmenopause slows bone loss; therapy begun later is lesseffective. It has been reported that 1,25 (OH),D3 andcalcitonin are increased in estrogen therapy. Estrogenmay act on osteoclastic precu,sors in bone by raising thethreshhold for PTH sensitivity. As summarized bySaville,'' studies reported that Estrogen therapy itself carries someadditional risks.18 One of these is a 3-7 times greater riskof endometrial cancer. Use of progestins in a cyclictreatment (at least for 10 days/month) for patients withan intact uterus may ameliorate some of the risk ofestrogen use.Use of estrogen therapy entails some special precau-tions: patients must be closely monitored for symptomsof breast and uterine cancer, and the smallest doses ofestrogen possible should be used. The finding thatadditional calcium (1 gm/day) compensates for the lackof estrogen\" makes the use of estrogen supplementationa matter for considerable deliberation. Women under-going oophoiectomy at early ages would be candidatesfor estrogen therapy, as would thin, white women withmultiple risk factors present for osteoporosis. All womenreceiving or contemplating the use of estrogen should becounseled about the relative risks involved with estrogenuse.Exercise is an important component of main-tenance of healthy bones. Patients should beencouraged to continue moderate exercisethroughout their lives. Finally, the effects of exercise must be considered. Ithas long been known that bone mass decreases withimmobilization. This has been further substantiated by 24 18 Nutrition in Health Promotion investigations into the effects of weightlessness in space-'light studies.\"'\" E Yercise may not only slow bone lossrates but may actually increase bone mass, providingthere is adetp ate dietary calcium available. There doesseem to be an optimal level of exercise. A recent report21has indicated that women joggers who trained withsufficient intensity to become amenorrheic also sufferedbone demineralization, even though the average age ofthe women was only 25. It seems appropriate to counselpatients that walking and swimming in amounts thatpromote cardiovascular fitness arc desirable. Even bed-ridden patients should be encouraged to do whateverisometric nercises are possible, taking into account theirparticular physical limitations.SummaryOsteoporosis is the loss of bone mass resulting in.........Table 21-11.increased fracture risk, particularly of the wrist, hip, andspine. Postmenopausal, white women of Europeanextraction are at the greatest risk. Since the degree of riskis related to the peak bone mass attained early inadulth000d, the most effective measures are aimed atproviding adequate calcium nutriture and plenty ofexercise during this time period. Once osteoporosis isevident, thereislittle chance of reversal. Cukiumsupplementation alone or with combinations of fluorideand/or vitamin D have been used with some success.Estrogen therapy, which entails some additional risks,may also be used. Exercise is very important in arrestingfurther bone loss in this population group.
