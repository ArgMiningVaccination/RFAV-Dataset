I am always intrigued to discover new ways to heal and improve my physical and mental wellbeing, but the wellbeing journey comes with a warning label! Over these 16 years, I have learned that when you know something you can't unknown it and this can sometimes be unsettling. Trying new treatments, embarking on personal development and self healing can uncover blocks, deep hidden thought processes and this can definitely upset the apple cart. Once started on this journey there is no going back. While all this may seem a bit doom and gloom, the upside is that once the process starts you eventually discover new things about yourself, perhaps feel more focused and sometimes a much needed change in direction evolves! The Harmonic Egg Session A couple of weeks ago I decided to try an incredible new treatment. [The Harmonic Egg](https://wellbeingmagazine.com/video/unlocking-the-ancient-secrets-to-healing-with-the-harmonic-egg/). Linda Cooper interviewed the inventor Gail Lynn, which we shared on Wellbeing Magazine back in August. Intrigued, I discovered there was a Harmonic Egg just a few miles away in Kings Hill at The Harmonic Centre [www.theharmoniccentre.co.uk](http://www.theharmoniccentre.co.uk/). Knowing how close it was I felt I had to try it out, so I booked an appointment with Aiste, completed a health questionnaire and arrived to find this space age egg, housed in a business office complex. I wasn't really sure what I should be focusing on so I decided that being peri menopausal, balancing hormones and resetting the nervous system was a good place to start, along with setting an intention for my creative pursuits. The session was extremely relaxing, (once I had managed to stop my mind from over thinking) I definitely drifted off for a few minutes and came out feeling relaxed and optimistic and keen to know if I would notice any changes. It has now been nearly two weeks and yes there have been some changes. I have stopped rushing around trying to fit everything in. My creative projects have come to a grinding halt, completely unable to continue the way I was before. But it is giving me the space to reevaluate what is really important. I have been focusing on making sure my daughters transition to secondary school is going well, driving her to and from school rather that the planned train journey she was going to take. I now have time to chat to her and support her through this big transition. I finally ripped out the old carpets (a job I have wanted to do for a few years), thrown out lots of stuff and am focusing on making our house a home we can be proud of. To be honest I have felt a bit lost, not doing all the busy things I am always doing, to my husband it may seem that the Harmonic Egg session broke me! In a way I hope it has, I hope it has reset me, helping me start another chapter in my personal growth. A much calmer, more spiritual and less manic life, one where I have the time to stop and appreciate my friends and family rather than rushing head long into the next project. I plan to return for another session, may be in a couple of weeks. Energy work needs time to settle and I have a feeling the Egg has a few more things it needs to do (or undo) Would I recommend a session? Oh yes definitely. Everyone's experience will be completely different. Some may use it for pain, an illness, stress or just out of curiosity. What ever your reason, expect the unexpected. Stay curious and enjoy the subtle changes, even if they are a little uncomfortable. As they say \"you can't make an omelette "}
