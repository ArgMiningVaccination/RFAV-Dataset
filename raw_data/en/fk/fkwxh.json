Elizabeth has received widespread acclaim for her work and has been featured in publications like Harper's Bazaar, Elle, and Allure. Elizabeth's journey to holistic medicine began early in life, but her own experience battling chronic illness led to a very personal interest in green, nontoxic beauty, household, and building materials.
