FIM publishes high-quality, peer-reviewed original research articles, reviews, opinions, commentaries, case reports, study protocols, and letters covering a wide range of topics in integrative medicine, including but not limited to traditional medicine, alternative medicine and complementary medicine. Integrative studies of modern medicine and traditional medicine are most welcome. Studies applying cutting-edge techniques to dissect the underlying mechanisms of traditional medicines are encouraged. Topics of special interest include conventional medicine, evidence-based medicine, acupuncture, mental health, dietary supplements, and other adjuvant therapies. FIM publishes both basic and clinical research, including but not limited to randomized controlled trials, interventional studies, cohort studies, observational studies, qualitative and mixed method studies, animal studies, and systematic reviews. FIM is seeking the following types of contributions: - Evidence-based medicine studies investigating drugs/medicines, dietary supplements, acupuncture, moxibustion and other non-drug treatments - Efficacy and safety-guided biomarker research - Epidemiologic studies - Efficacy-associated pharmacological characterization - Molecular mechanism studies (computational and in silico studies will not be accepted unless followed by experimental validation) - Pharmacologically active substances and quality control Specific requirements: - Single-dose pharmacological studies will not be accepted unless the study has justification on specific ethical grounds. - The botanical ingredients of herbal formulae or products must be explicitly stated. - The chemical compositions of an herbal extract or product must be well characterized by chromatographic techniques, i.e., HPLC, UPLC, HPTLC, or LC-MS. - For purchased compounds, purity (%) and the supplier's name must be included. - Pharmacological studies on common or ubiquitous compounds such as -sitosterol will not be accepted, because these compounds cannot be assumed to be \"active\". - The species name and plant part (drug) must be stated unambiguously. Scientific species names must be fully validated taxonomically (including authorities/families) using the Kew Medicinal plant names service or an alternative source such as thePlantList.org. - Compliance with international ethical standards is essential. All ethical issues must be stated clearly. "}
