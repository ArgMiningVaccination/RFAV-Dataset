Ready for a truly natural skin care experience? Grab our Skin Care Trial Set! Most skin care companies make products that are mostly water \u2014 which doesn't actually nourish your skin. What it does do is create a thinner, cheaper product that they charge you a premium for anyway. When you add water, you also have to add synthetic emulsifiers, preservatives, and other ingredients that don't benefit your skin at all. At Earthley, we think there's a better way \u2014 a cleaner, simpler, and more effective way. That's where our skin care with natural ingredients comes in. We've thoroughly studied the properties of different oils, so we know what different skin types really need. Unlike other companies, we don't just claim coconut oil does it all. All-Natural Cleanser Our all-natural cleanser comes in bar form. That's because liquid cleansers are either harsh, drying castile soap, or detergent. We don't think either option is good for skin. When we create a bar, we formulate only true soap that's mild enough for facial skin. Plus, it's super-fatted so it leaves behind beneficial oils and doesn't dry your skin out. Choose the Charcoal Facial Bar for oily or acne-prone skin, and the 3-in-1 for dry, sensitive, or combination skin. All-Natural Toner Our herbal toner makes use of two key ingredients \u2014 witch hazel and rose petals. These natural, organic herbs soothe sensitive skin, even-out skin tone, and promote oil balance. All-Natural Moisturizer Our all-natural moisturizer is truly unique. Each is formulated for oily/acne prone skin, or dry/sensitive skin. Our oily skin moisturizer has been formulated very carefully with key oils that won't clog pores, reduce overproduction of bad oils that clog pores, and reduce redness and irritation from acne breakouts. Our dry skin moisturizer is made with deeply nourishing oils that relieve dry skin without clogging pores. You won't find any other company that formulates as carefully as Earthley does \u2014 which is why ours works! Natural Facial Serum Finally, there's our natural facial serum. No matter what your skin type, you won't want to be without this. It's made with high-end oils and essential oils, to balance out oil production, heal scars, reduce fine lines, and more. Why Our Natural Skin Care is Different You won't find any compromise ingredients in any of these products! We use only carefully-selected organic and cold-pressed oils, pure essential oils, and organic herbs. The oils are all non-comedogenic and right for individual skin types. We never use: - Synthetic emulsifiers - Preservatives - Colors - Soy - Gluten - Parabens - Phthalates - ...anything unnecessary or toxic It's the absolute cleanest, safest, and most effective skin care set you'll ever use!
