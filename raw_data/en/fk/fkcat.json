Edison Becoming a doctor of chiropractic is no small undertaking. In most states it requires eight years of schooling - four years of undergraduate study, mostly focusing on the sciences and four years of chiropractic school. On average, chiropractic school requires 372 more hours of classroom time than medical school. More time is spent studying anatomy, physiology, diagnostics, and orthopedics in chiropractic school than in medical school. In addition, twenty hours of continual training is required each year, but most chiropractors get more. Chiropractors are well-educated healers who have varied opinions on vaccines and pharmaceuticals. But, trained in medicine, with a more holistic perspective, chiropractors tend to be, on average, a great deal more skeptical of vaccines than physicians. The following chiropractors are speaking up to inform the public about the dangers of vaccines. Dr. David Jockers, D.C.Vaccines are one of medicine's prized attempts to improve human performance. They use artificial laboratory derived medical technology to produce an immune response within the body in hopes it will lead to a long-term positive antibody response.The vaccine ideology is based on the belief that people are created with inferior immune systems that are unable to keep up with the demands of the environment and need modern technology in the form of man-made [vaccine](https://www.naturalnews.com/vaccine.html) formulations in order to bolster immunity.According to the Centers for Disease Control, \"The following substances are found in flu vaccines: aluminum, antibiotics, formaldehyde, human aborted fetal apparatus (dead human tissue), monosodium glutamate (MSG), and thimerosal (mercury).\" Many of these same ingredients are in childhood [vaccines](https://www.naturalnews.com/vaccines.html). They are all very toxic for human physiology and have a track record for insulting the body's immune system.I would prefer to trust the innate ability of the body to overcome infectious microorganisms and I will fully support my body through healthy diet and lifestyle along with natural supplements and proper spinal alignment. I absolutely reject the idea that injecting a group of toxic, immune insulting chemicals into my bloodstream will improve someone's long-term immune response. Nancy Tarlow, D.C.When you inject chemicals into your body that are toxic, there will be an effect. It may not be obvious at first. A child might have a fever that the doctor says is \"normal\", but it isn't. A fever or screaming could be that the brain is swelling and causing damage. The real problem is that children cannot convey to us how they feel. It's not like an adult who can tell us that they felt great prior to a vaccination but then started having health problems. Dr. Haroot Tovanyan, D.C.I am a doctor of Chiropractic and I primarily work with autistic children. ... Every single parent in my practice that has an autistic [child](https://www.naturalnews.com/child.html) has the same story. Child was born normal; child was developing normal. Child went in for their 12-month, 18-month, normal usually 24 or 36-month shots and regressed. This may be anecdotal, but when you hear it over and over and over again, there's something to be said. These are children that have severe neurological issues. They're not verbal; 8-10-year-old children that are still wearing diapers. I have a quadriplegic niece in my family who received 4 shots, a total of 10 vaccines in 1 day. She was born normal. She developed normal until about a year and a half. At a year and a half she received 4 shots, 1, 2, 3, 4, and she ... This was 1990 when they started doing multiple vaccines and they also quadrupled the number of shots that you're normally receiving. She basically regressed. She's a vegetable. I mean, she became a quadriplegic. Nowhere in nature would your child go to get exposed to let's say 6 or 7 or 8 or 9, or in the case of my niece, 10 viruses and bacteria at the same time.In nature that just doesn't happen. They don't co-exist like that. It's not natural to put a combination of vaccines, combinations of viruses and bacteria that just don't belong together or don't co-exist in nature in a vial and inject it into a child and expect them to be healthy. The CDC schedule has never been tested for safety. There have never been double-blind studies. It's never been tested for synergistic effect. They've refused to study un-vaccinated versus vaccinated.
