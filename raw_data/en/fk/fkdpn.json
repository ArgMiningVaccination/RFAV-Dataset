Florida's [State Health Improvement Plan (SHIP)](http://www.floridahealth.gov/about-the-department-of-health/about-us/state-and-community-health-assessment/ship-process/index.html) is updated every few years to address the most pressing public health issues, including prevention and control of infectious disease, chronic disease prevention (including efforts to help residents maintain a healthy weight), community partnerships to reach diverse population groups, improving access to care and maintenance of the state's healthcare infrastructure. Dedicated initiatives also target specific public health issues, such as [Zika-Free Florida](https://zikafreefl.org/), which fights the spread of this serious mosquito-borne illness, efforts to combat [prescription drug abuse](http://www.floridahealth.gov/provider-and-partner-resources/dpac/_documents/prescription-brochure-fact.pdf), the [Refugee Health Program](http://www.floridahealth.gov/programs-and-services/community-health/refugee-health/index.html), the [HIV/AIDS Surveillance to assist [people with disabilities](http://www.floridahealth.gov/programs-and-services/people-with-disabilities/index.html), and [emergency preparedness](http://www.floridahealth.gov/programs-and-services/emergency-preparedness-and-response/index.html), which prepares for the public health needs that can arise during and after natural disasters, such as hurricanes.

Public Health Internships & Fellowships in Florida Internships and fellowships provide students with firsthand experience in a specific field, working with experienced professionals who can share their knowledge and observe the student's progress. However, there are some notable differences. Internships may be either paid or unpaid and can last anywhere from a few weeks to a year, depending on the program, while giving students exposure to hands-on work in a professional environment. Fellowships, conversely, last anywhere from a few months to three years, and while they also provide hands-on experience, they are usually intensive, paid programs which can prepare a student for future leadership roles in their field. Here are some examples of internships and fellowships available to students enrolled in online MPH programs in Florida. Keep in mind that these are hands-on programs that must be completed in-person, even if all other coursework is taken online. FIU Internship Program in Dietetics Based at Florida International University (FIU) in Miami, this internship lasts two semesters and prepares graduates to become registered dietitians or nutritionists who can encourage healthy eating and lifestyle choices.

Public Health Professional Organizations in Florida Professional organizations in public health offer numerous benefits to current students and recent graduates of online MPH programs in Florida, and they are well worth their membership fees. Some offer career services or job boards, and may hold meetings in your area that provide valuable networking opportunities that can assist in the job search. They also offer continuing education programs that allow you to stay current in your field and earn CE credit to maintain any certifications you hold. Annual conferences are another excellent benefit of these organizations. - [Florida Public Health Association (FPHA):](http://www.fpha.org/)The FPHA was established in 1931 and supports Florida's public health professionals and students through advocacy, networking, and professional development opportunities.

Public Health Certifications and Licenses in Florida Dietitians, nutritionists, and nutrition counselors practicing in Florida must all be licensed by the Dietetics and Nutrition Practice Council. Many public health careers, such as health educators, do not require licenses or certifications in Florida. Medical practitioners, however, must have proper licensure whether they work in public health or not. Dietitians, nutritionists, and nutrition counselors practicing in Florida must all be licensed by the [Dietetics and Nutrition Practice Council](http://www.floridahealth.gov/%5C/licensing-and-regulation/dietetic-nutrition/index.html). Although certification is not required for many positions, it still can be a distinct professional advantage in the job market. For example, you can earn a certification in public health (CPH) by the [National Board of Public Health Examiners](https://www.nbphe.org/). Earning this certification shows potential employers that your education and experience allow you to meet a recognized national standard in public health. Some schools offer graduate certificates for specialized public health topics online, including community health management, environmental public health, epidemiology, infection control, biostatistics, food safety and more. Graduate certificates like these can be a valuable addendum to your master's degree. Accreditation for Online Public Health Master's Programs in Florida Accreditation is crucial for any program or institute of higher education. When a school or program is accredited, it has successfully passed an evaluation of its curriculum, and indicates to your prospective employers and others that you received a quality education. Regional accreditation is the most prestigious type; six agencies oversee six regions of states throughout the country, and usually accredit nonprofit private and public institutions. The regional body overseeing Florida schools is the [Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS)](http://www.sacs.org/). National accreditation is the less prestigious variety, and is generally granted to for-profit institutions and trade schools. Certain fields, including public health, have accreditation bodies which oversee specific programs in that subject. When choosing online MPH programs in Florida, be sure that any program you consider is accredited by the [Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH)](https://ceph.org/). CEPH handles accreditation for schools of public health and standalone baccalaureate programs in Florida and throughout the United States. CEPH is a private, nonprofit organization recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and a member of the Association of Specialized and Professional Accreditors (ASPA). A program accredited by CEPH is recognized as meeting the established standard for education in public health. This programmatic accreditation often is applied to a program at a school which holds regional accreditation. Directory of Online Master's in Public Health Programs in Florida Florida A&M University Florida A&M is a historically black university based in Tallahassee. The Florida legislature created Florida A&M's Institute of Public Health (IPH) in 1995 with the explicit purpose of creating better health opportunities for the Sunshine State's poor and underserved citizens. The IPH has continued to evolve and now offers a [master of public health program online](http://pharmacy.famu.eduhttps://res.cloudinary.com/highereducation/image/upload/v1532015113/PublicHealth.org/2016/04/MPH_Student_Handbook-Revised-62416.pdf). Unlike the program's on-campus counterpart \u2014 which offers specific concentrations \u2014 the online MPH program is generalist. All online students complete a public health practice concentration, which prepares graduates for either leadership positions in public health organizations or a career that combines public health with another discipline. This degree is one of the best online MPH programs in Florida and requires students to complete a total of 50 credits. The curriculum includes core courses in epidemiology, health policy, and behavioral science. Students must also complete a culminating experience, consisting of an internship, an applied research project, and a comprehensive examination. As the online program is practice-oriented, all applicants must already have three years of professional public health work experience. To that end, the program intentionally caters to working professionals, delivering coursework asynchronously through Blackboard to allow students the flexibility to work and go to school simultaneously. The school also allows students to enroll in classes on a full- or part-time basis. Applicants must have either a GPA of 3.0 or better over their last 60 credits or a cumulative undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or better. All applicants must submit a statement of interest, GRE scores, and three letters of recommendation. Though Florida A&M does not allow out-of-state online graduate students to pay in-state tuition, out-of-state online tuition is only slightly higher than in-state tuition. Florida International University Based in the University Park neighborhood of Miami, FIU's public health and social work school leverages a location at the \"intersection of the Americas\" to serve traditionally underrepresented populations, particularly immigrants from Central America. While the college's online MPH [program](http://fiuonline.fiu.edu/programs/online-graduate-degrees/master-of-public-health.php) does not explicitly focus on these demographics, the degree does prepare students to evaluate environmental and social factors in health among diverse populations. To that end, the program's 45-credit curriculum provides students with a broad background in public health and includes core courses in statistics, epidemiology, environmental health, and health behavior. The program delivers all courses asynchronously, allowing students to complete coursework at their own pace. Students can enroll in courses on a full- or part-time basis. Students must also complete a culminating practicum and an integrative seminar. The practicum requirement may be replaced with a three-credit course for students with three years of relevant public health professional experience. Most students can earn their degree in just 18 months. Students pursuing an MPH in Florida can also choose FIU's accelerated option, which takes only one year to complete. The program is ideal for working professionals and students with diverse backgrounds. The school requires a minimum undergraduate GPA of 3.0 for admission. Additionally, all applicants must submit GRE scores. All online students pay the same tuition rate, regardless of residency. Students can pay off some of the tuition by securing a [graduate assistantship or fellowship](https://stempel.fiu.edu/student-life/funding-your-education/) provided by FIU's public health and social work school. FIU also offers a $2,700 [merit scholarship](http://fiuonline.fiu.edu/programs/online-graduate-degrees/master-of-public-health.php) specifically for online students.

Additionally, students can pursue graduate certificates in [public health](https://osteopathic.nova.edu/ph/public_health.html) and [health education](https://osteopathic.nova.edu/ph/health_education.html). These certification classes can be applied towards the MPH degree as long as they were earned with a \"B\" grade or above. University of Florida UF's college of public health and health professions blends \"public health problem solving and individual patient care.\" To that end, the college offers programs that all focus on hands-on learning, including case studies and internships. The school offers an online master of public health [program](http://mph.ufl.edu/prospective-students/mph/online-mph-degree/) that requires students to complete a five-credit internship in the field.

These 44 credits include core courses in population assessment, public health practice, and public health history. All MPH students must also complete a field experience, a comprehensive exam, and a special project. The number of required fieldwork hours is reduced for students with at least two years of public health work experience. Online courses are delivered asynchronously, allowing students to complete coursework at their own pace.
