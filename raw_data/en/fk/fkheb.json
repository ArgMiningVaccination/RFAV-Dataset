While Western-centric in her views on medicine until her ordeal six years ago, Shah realized that the traditional and the alternative could work together \u2014 at a place online she calls Jill's List. \"After the whole experience, I realized information on alternative medicine was spread from word of mouth instead of an online rate-and-review database,\" said Shah, a mother of two. The Jill's List platform launched yesterday at Boston Medical Center, allowing patients to schedule appointments for treatments ranging from aromatherapy to \"zero balancing,\" and doctors and practitioners to exchange notes and medical records. \"For several chronic conditions like back pain and fibromyalgia, conventional therapies don't necessarily leave the patient fully satisfied. What Jill's List provides isn't alternative care; it is complementary,\" said Boston Medical Center's Dr. Robert Saper. The service lists medical professionals on the site only after their credentials \u2014 state licenses or training \u2014 are checked out by Jill's List staff. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital will start using Jill's List next month. "}
