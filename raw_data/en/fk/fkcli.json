Our observations in larval hemocytes suggest that Stoned and Eps15 regulate clathrin mediated dynamin-dependent endocytotic process, specifically by catalyzing the recruitment of clathrin to pits at early stages of membrane retrieval. in order to further understand the regulation of receptor mediated endocytosis by tyrosine kinase, the role of Cdk5/p 35 was studied. homozygous combinations were made with shibire alleles namely ts1, ts 2, and ck2. initial experiments to check paralysis profiles suggest that the p35 null causes enhancement of shibire paralysis, implicating a role for Cdk5 mediated phophorylation in synaptic vesicle recycling. Surface accessibility assays isolated were done using p35 mutant and transgenes of Cdk5 driven by collagen- Gal4. The clearance of surface receptors is adversely affected in p35 mutant background. We also observe that p35 mutants affect the temperature dependent paralysis phenotype of shibire flies. at the cellular level, abrogation of p35 or Cdk5 genetically or by pharmacological reagents adversely affected receptor internalization in hemocytes. Cultured embryonic neurons from mutant and wild type Drosophila are being analyzed as a prospective system for study of vesicle recycling. Collaborator: S. Mayor, NCBS 2 Anaesthetic response in Drosophila Ludwin PintoSeveral genetic loci that seems to be involved in the response of Drosophila to general anesthetics have been identified. These include G aBa receptor subtypes, channel proteins and several molecules crucial for maintaining membrane potential and synaptic function. The genetic interaction amongst these many loci is presently being assessed. 3 Peptides of therapeutic value from marine cone snails Hanumae Gowd, Benjamin Franklin and Santhana Ramasamy a previously unexplored source of drugs, the Conus species of marine snails with a repertoire of toxic peptides (referred to as conotoxins/conopeptides), are now being looked at as a shibire (b) and shibire stoned double (c) showing eye scar compared to wild type(a).

The highly specific conopeptides from Conus, once characterized, could be exploited as pharmacological tools in neuroscience and in search for drugs to treat many debilitating diseases. Conus forms the largest single genus of venomous animals with more than 700 species, each expressing approximately a hundred conopeptides. however, less than 0.5% of the active peptides in Conus venoms have been elucidated leaving much scope for toxin identification and characterization. in addition a large fraction of cone snail species is endemic to india. The highly structured cysteine rich peptides secreted by the venom gland of these carnivorous marine snails are secreted as a prepropeptide with a highly conserved superfamily-specific signal sequence and a highly variable C-terminal mature peptide. rather unusual post translational modifications and very specific cleavage of the mature peptide occur before the venom cocktail is steered to the storage sac while awaiting its target. There exists approximately 77 species of Conus in india of which many still remain to be characterized. The overall aim of this project lies in identifying, isolating and characterizing conopeptides from indian cone snails. We have isolated many novel peptides from a few cone snail species collected off the shores of South Eastern india and T iFr. Mass spectrometry-based de novo sequencing was performed on conotoxin Mo 1274 isolated from a vermivorous Cone snail Conus monile. The electron capture dissociation technique was used to identify and localize the tryptophan residues undergoing bromination. The experimentally determined sequence was validated by chemical derivatization and protease digestion followed by mass spectrometry. Classification of this peptide into the T-1 family of conotoxins was done based on the observation that the two disulfides of Mo 1274 connect cysteine and from Conus lorosii and Conus amadis were successfully synthesized. The synthetic peptides have been shown to fold like their natural counterparts and also to exhibit large effects on Voltage gated calcium channels.Collaborator: P . Balaram and S. Sikdar, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 4 Molecular Phylogeny Santhana RamasamyCharacterisation of various conopeptides isolated from C.virgo, C.loroisii and C.achatinus was checked by the tail flick assay in mice for analgesia. The assay is currently being carried out with both synthetic and natural Vi1369 peptides. attempts are underway to identify the molecular targets of these peptides. in an attempt to generate a phylogenetic tree of indian cone snails, sequences obtained from the COi, Calmodulin and 16s rrna of nearly thirty Conus sp have been obtained and are being analysed.

This resulted in the identification of 4 new species, thereby increasing the number of Conus species of india from 77 to 81. With a long term study of the distribution of Conidae along the entire indian coast, with its diverse habitats, these additional new species could be identified thereby paving way to the isolation of even more novel conopeptides. a morphology and morphometric analysis of radular teeth from 22 species of Conus snails (collected from the East and West coast of india) resulted in the development of a simplified species identification method based on tooth morphology. Partial characterization of Conus araneosus venom was done using rP- hPLC, ESi-MS and M aLDi-TOF-TOF. Biological assays were carried out for 5 peptides from C.araneosus to study analgesic and aggression scores in mouse and rats. a sleep inducing peptide has been identified from the venom of C.araneosus. Currently we have an inventory of nearly fifty toxin peptides at various stages of identification, characterization and chemical synthesis.Collaborators: Anthony Fernando and Olivia Fernando, Annamalai University and P . Balram, Indian Institute broad aim of my laboratory is to provide an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of endocytosis in metazoan cells. in this regard we have undertaken to develop a framework to understand principles of membrane organization and deformation in living cells. For scientists interested in studying phenomena at the cellular scale, principles from the physical and chemical sciences provide a powerful paradigm in framing questions about the mechanisms of movement of molecules and organelles inside cells. Consequently, we have taken a multi-disciplinary approach, combining biology with theoretical physics and synthetic chemistry, to address the main theme of our research at nCBS. We have developed new microscopy techniques to study nanometer scale organization of cellular components. Using fluorescence microscopy we have explored sorting properties and endocytic pathways of a variety of molecules, including membrane proteins, lipids and lipid-tethered proteins, both in living cells in tissue culture and in vivo. Our method of choice is to study the organization and dynamics of fluorescently-tagged molecules at different scales in living cells; from the nanometer scale in specialized domains in cell membranes to the micron scale prevalent in mapping endocytic pathways or in specialized regions of the cell surface. We are now involved in several lines of inquiry, some continuing and others more recently configured. These include: i) continuing studies on understanding structure and function of membrane rafts, in collaboration with Prof. Madan rao at raman research institute, Bangalore; ii) continuing studies on understanding the mechanism of dynamin-independent endocytosis using specific targeted molecular perturbations coupled with high resolution microscopy and single-molecule biochemistry; iii) genome-wide rnai-based screening of genes involved in dynamin-dependent and independent forms of endocytosis in Drosophila cells; iv) functional genomics of different endocytic pathways in the context of their role in a metazoan system capable of genetic manipulation, in collaboration with Prof. KS Krishnan, T iFr, Mumbai; v) exploring pathways of antigen presentation for loading onto MhC class ii, and endocytic mechanisms that modulate the presence of long-term cell surface resident proteins. The trajectory of this work has led us to explore the fine structure of the plasma membrane, providing for the first time an in vivo picture of lipidic assemblies challenging existing notions of membrane rafts, an understanding of the cellular basis for the establishment of developmental gradients, and novel pathways for antigen presentation, long-term cell surface resident protein modulation.Mechanisms of endocytosis in metazoan cells mayor@ncbs.res.inSATYAJIT MAYOR Scales of organization in metazoans, integrating biology with physics and chemistry. Starting at the scale of molecules, molecular players interact to generate larger scale structures in the context of cells (e. g. membrane rafts). These in turn participate to create processes at the cellular scale (e. g. pathways of endocytosis). Several endocytic pathways function to regulate phenomenon at the next level of organization (e. g. information transfer at neuronal synapses, morphogen gradients to specify tissue patterns or control cell signalling outputs in the larger multicellular organism). Focussing on the mechanism of a basic cellular process, namely endocytosis, studies in my laboratory using functional genomics are aimed at integrating different scales of organization in biology.

Chirality-induced raft-mediated mechanism Subhashri Ghosh and Riya RaghupathyOur concept of the structure and organization of the membrane of cells has undergone major revisions from the time of the fluid mosaic model proposed by Singer and nicolson. instead of considering the membrane as a 'two-dimensional oriented solution of integral proteins in a viscous phospholipid bilayer', both protein and lipid components of the bilayer are anisotropically arranged in the lateral and vertical directions. in living cells, it has been difficult to visualize these heterogeneities. Lateral heterogeneities variously called membrane rafts or domains, have been particularly difficult to visualize, and the most compelling evidence for such structures in the undifferentiated plasma membrane of cells is functional. With the help of theoretical (condensed matter) physicist Prof. Madan rao, we are probing the architecture of these lateral heterogeneities and the basis for their formation. These studies have required the development of new tools of biophysics to study membrane heterogeneities in situ, and a new physico-chemical understanding of the properties of membranes in living cells. From an operational perspective we have focussed on understanding how an exoplasmic lipid-tethered protein [Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPi)-anchored proteins] is distributed in cell membranes. This has obvious implications for understanding the structure and function of lipidic assemblies in membranes. Our work provides a fundamentally different picture of the structure and formation of lipid rafts, summarized in the adjoining Figure 1. We believe that these approaches will provide an understanding of how local membrane composition and physical properties of membranes are maintained and regulated in living cells. Collaborator: Madan Rao, Raman Research Institute, Bangalore 2 Mechanism of GPI-anchored proteins via a Chadda and Sudha KumariGPi-anchored proteins are a large class of proteins of extreme diversity in structure and function; 10% of all membrane proteins are tethered to the membrane via a GPi-anchor. Several receptors and pathogenic molecules depend on the presence of the GPi-anchor for their function. For example, the main mammalian folate receptor requires the GPi-anchor for efficient delivery of folate into cells. Understanding the nature of sorting of GPi- anchored proteins thus, has implications for physiology and pathology of a large fraction of membrane proteins. We had discovered that GPi-anchored proteins are sorted at the cell surface of mammalian cells into a Cdc42-regulated, clathrin and dynamin-independent endocytic pathway that is also a major pathway for the internalization of the fluid-phase into most cells (Figure 2). We have termed this pathway, the GPi-anchored protein enriched early endosomal (GEEC) pathway. Changing specific lipid levels in cells affects the sorting of the GPi-anchored proteins in endosomes, and at the cell surface, altering the efficiency of endocytic uptake. These data and others indicate that GPi-anchored proteins may exist as pre-sorted microdomains or rafts in membranes of endosomes which in turn are responsible Figure 1. Actively generated spatial and temporal organization of raft components: Data from our laboratory regarding physical characteristics of nanoscale clusters of GPi-anchored proteins in living cells show that these structures are small, dynamic, and co-exist with monomers; they are also distributed in a non-random fashion on the surface of cells. These structures may be actively induced to form large-scale stable 'rafts'. These studies provide a different picture of membrane rafts where GPi-anchored proteins form nano-scale lipid assemblies in specific regions of the plasma membrane which in turn may determine local lipid composition. Black circles, GPi-anchored proteins; red and pink circles, non-raft associated lipids; yellow circles, raft-associated lipids; green, for GPI-anchored proteins and the fluid-phase We are now utilizing an rnai-based, high content, high throughput microscopy strategy to uncover molecular players involved in the pathway of endocytosis of GPi-anchored proteins. For this purpose we have developed a custom-built microscopy platform centred on a multi-well slide assay format for quantitative analysis of uptake of multiple probes for different endocytic pathways in cells grown in the presence of individual rnai spotted onto a single well, spanning fluid-phase Of the many pathways of internalization available at the cell surface, GPi-anchored proteins are predominantly internalized via a specific class of pinosomes called GEECs, by a clathrin and dynamin-independent mechanism in tissue culture mammalian fibroblasts and primary hemocytes from Drosophila. for their specific sorting function. Currently studies in the laboratory are focused on understanding molecular mechanisms and sorting principles utilized by GPi-anchored proteins. 3 Genome-wide RNAi screening of genes involved in dynamin-dependent and independent forms of endocytosis in Drosophila cells.Gagan Gupta, Gautam Dey and M.G. Swetha The prevalence of the GEEC pathway in Drosophila cells has opened up an opportunity to examine genes involved in this type of endocytosis using a relatively simple genome-wide rnai perturbation strategy. To do this, we have established high content and high throughput assays based primarily on imaging of endocytic uptake in cultured cells from Drosophila (Figure 3). We have focussed on two major membrane pathways, dynamin-dependent endocytosis and membrane organization in Drosophila, a metazoan system capable of genetic Swetha, Debanjan Goswami and Riddhi MajumdarThe availability of the tools of genetics in a metazoan system such as Drosophila provide a unique opportunity to examine the form and function of endocytosis and membrane organization in the context of a whole animal. Using primary cell cultures from Drosophila, originally established in the laboratory, a variety of endocytic processes may be analyzed at high resolution. We have focused on two major membrane trafficking pathways, endocytosis at the cell surface and understanding biogenesis of lysosomes, and expanded our study to the organization of the cholesterol-tethered morphogen, the hedgehog protein. NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 56 7/10/08 5:33:50 PM57Our aim is, firstly, to relate alteration in cellular trafficking pathways to mutations in specific genes in the hope of uncovering molecular machinery behind these basic cellular processes, and secondly, to relate alterations in trafficking processes to perturbations in integrative processes in the whole animal such as those involved in establishing developmental gradients and control of intracellular signaling. at the level of membrane protein organization and its functional implications we have studied the organization of the hedgehog (hh) morphogen. These studies have suggested a hierarchical organization of a membrane protein, from the nano to the micron-scale. This organization contributes to distinct functionality of a diffusible morphogen. We have found that hh forms nanoscale clusters, determined by specific residues in its protein domain, and these clusters in turn organize to larger scale structures that participate in transporting the hh protein over many cell diameters. Collaborator: K.S. Krishnan, NCBS 5 Understanding pathways of antigen presentation for loading onto MHC class II and endocytic mechanisms that modulate the cell surface presence of long-term resident surface proteinsSudha Kumari antigen presentation is an essential function of the immune system in its ability to deal with infections. in this regard the presentation of soluble antigen to cells of the immune system has a central role.We have been studying processes of antigen presentation which utilize cytosolic pathways of antigen generation and MhC Class ii restricted presentation. We succeeded in identifying intracellular sites of this pivotal event in antigen presentation, after providing the antigen to antigen presenting cells (aPC) in different ways - as free peptides, or as a fusion constructs. This pathway is likely to be extremely important in mechanisms of generating tolerance of CD4+ T-cells to self-antigens. in addition to our ongoing studies on antigen presentation, we have used the cells of the immune system to study how cell surface levels of long-term resident membrane proteins may be acutely modulated. here we have focused on: a) the role of the hiV Nef protein on the immune co-stimulatory molecules, CD8O and CD86; b), endogenous mechanisms by which the acetylcholine receptor is modulated by autoimmune antibodies and ligands.Collaborators: Satyajit Rath, National Institute of Immunology, New sarina@ncbs.res.in The regulation of cell number is critical for the normal development of multicellular organisms. Molecular mechanisms regulating cellular death processes are largely evolutionarily conserved in metazoans. as in several other systems, the regulated depletion of cells is critical for the maintenance of immune system homeostasis. in the mammalian immune system, the bulk of circulating T-cells activated as a consequence of encounter with antigen are fated to die [via a programmed pathway of death or apoptosis] with only a small subset of antigen-reactive cells set aside to generate immune memory. Thus, expansion and reduction in cell number are recurring events in the immune system. Several aspects of this process can be recapitulated in vitro and offer an attractive model system to investigate the molecular underpinnings of cellular homeostatic mechanisms. activated T-cell apoptosis is regulated by the Bcl-2 family, comprising both pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. reactive oxygen species are also key intermediates of T-cell death. Specifically, we are probing signaling events that regulate pro-death cascades; the interactions of the latter with cellular survival machinery and the consequences of this for T-cell function. Some of our recent experiments are described in the sections that follow.Mechanisms of apoptosisAPURV A SARIN Srivastava, S., Banerjee, H., Chaudhry, A., V., Durdik, J.M. and Rath, S.

Evidence for a role for notch signaling in the cytokine-dependent survival of activated T-cells. rVa T-cell survival P . Divya and B. GeethaSignaling via the transmembrane receptor notch regulates several aspects of metazoan development. in the context of T-cells, notch signaling regulates commitment to the T-cell lineage. Subsequently, in the early stages of T-cell activation, signaling via notch facilitates the immune response to infection by regulating the cytokine interleukin-2 ( iL-2) receptor expression. iL-2 functions not only as a growth factor, promoting T-cell proliferation and survival, but also primes T-cells activated by self-antigens for death. T-cell activation is accompanied by increased processing of notch and consequently notch signaling. Since iL-2 drives both survival and death, we asked if notch biases iL-2 signaling towards either one of these outcomes in activated T-cells. activated T-cells express high levels of iL-2r and can be maintained in culture in the cytokines iL-2, iL-15 or iL-7. Disrupting notch processing resulted in T-cell apoptosis which could not be inhibited by any of the aforementioned cytokines. This indicated that concurrent signaling from notch and cytokine receptors was required for activated T-cell survival. Further in both activated CD4 + and CD8+ subsets of T-cells, notch inhibited the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (r OS), enhanced expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL and positively regulated the pro-survival kinase akt/PKB signaling. These observations were confirmed by the ectopic expression of the notch intracellular domain or in activated T-cell subsets enriched for notch expression. Collectively, the experiments implicated notch signaling in the cytokine-dependent survival of activated T-cells (Figure 1).2 Notch signaling regulates Bax function Lakshmi R. PerumalsamyDuring apoptosis of activated T-cells as well as several other cell types, the pro-apoptotic molecule Bax undergoes a conformational change consistent with its activation and apoptotic activity. as discussed in the preceding section, notch regulated activated T-cell survival and therefore we asked if notch signaling converged on the regulation of Bax activation in T-cells. The conformational change in Bax is revealed by a conformation specific antibody (clone 6a7), which recognizes an epitope in the n-terminus. Thus, 6a7 reactivity is detected in activated T-cells undergoing neglect-induced death (Figure 2, upper panel). Further, cells treated with a gamma secretase inhibitor (GSi) which blocks notch processing also presented 6a7 reactivity (Figure 2 lower panel) consistent with the activation of Bax and subsequent induction of apoptosis. notch regulation of Bax activation was also demonstrable in mammalian cell lines. Ectopically expressed Bax tagged to green fluorescent protein (Bax-GFP) coalesces into large clusters several of which overlap with mitochondria, which can be visualized by expressing Mito-Dsr ed (Figure 3, upper panel). Co-expressing notch restored diffuse, cytoplasmic localization of Bax and prevented Figure 1. The model summarizes outcomes of perturbing Notch signaling in activated T-cells. notch activity positively regulates cell survival, inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species (r OS) and converging on the activation of the serine-threonine kinase akt/ PKB and upregulation of expression undergoing neglect-induced apoptosis and following perturbation of Notch processing. activated T-cells stained for a conformationally active form of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax [clone 6a7] in conditions of cytokine-deprivation or neglect induced death [ani D, upper panel] or following treatment with a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSi-X) that blocks notch processing in 5\u00b5m. NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 59 7/10/08 5:33:52 mitochondria (Figure lower panel). Similarly inhibition of Bax activation and apoptosis was also observed in cells expressing a processed (activated) form of the notch intracellular domain. Taken together, these and experiments demonstrated that notch signaling inhibited Bax activation and oligomerization, thereby regulating a key antagonist of activated T-cell survival. 3 The serine-threonine kinase Akt Parikh, Lakshmi R. Perumalsamy and D. VaigundanBax function is negatively regulated by mechanisms that promote its retention in the cytosol and by anti-apoptotic molecules such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-x L that antagonize Bax function at the mitochondrion. The Bax n-terminus had been implicated in its localization to mitochondria and the triggering of cytotoxicity. While, the B h3 domain regulates interactions within the family, it is becoming increasingly apparent that regions other than the B h3 contribute to Bax function. in recent experiments we showed that the B h3 and TM1 domains in Bax are adequate for association with Bcl-xL and localization to mitochondria respectively, but an intact n-terminus played a non- redundant role in the regulation of Bax cytotoxicity by Bcl-xL. Earlier work from our laboratory had shown that the kinases akt and MEK target a region in the Bax n-terminus to ensure its cytoplasmic sequestration in T-cells. Thus, we asked if Bcl-xL and akt regulate Bax via similar mechanisms as Bax- induced apoptosis is inhibited by the serine-threonine kinase akt. a site-directed substitution mutant of Bax with alanine substitutions of the Ser/Thr residues (T14, S 15, S 16) in the n-terminus (Bax-ala3) was refractory to inhibition by constitutively active C a-akt (Figure 4a). interestingly, the modification in the n-terminus did not interfere with Bcl-xL inhibition of Bax-ala3 induced apoptosis (Figure 4b) giving the first indications that the two anti-apoptotic pathways target Bax function via distinct mechanisms. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 4c, C a-akt did not change the Bax function by distinct mechanisms. a & b, apoptosis triggered by expressing the recombinant proteins indicated in the panels. c, active-akt does not regulate the subcellular distribution of the Bax mutant, Bax-ala3. hEK cells expressing Bax-ala-3GFP and Dsr ed2-Mito in the absence [upper panel] or of [lower panel]. Scale 3. Ectopically expressed full-length Bax function. Bax-GFP around mitochondria [marked with the Dsred2-Mito] in apoptotic cells. When co-expressed with notch-FL, Bax-GFP focus of my laboratory is to identify the molecular mechanisms that organize mitochondria and regulate its function in an organism. The mitochondrial network in a cell is composed of branched tubular reticula interspersed with small kidney-bean shaped compartments. Mitochondrial remodeling involves a dynamic process of fission and fusion of the organelle essential for maintenance of the mitochondrial network and function. While fusion promotes inter-mitochondrial exchange of DNA and complementation of mtDNA mutations, fission enables distribution of mitochondria to discrete regions in the cell to perform specific functions. Defects in mitochondrial remodeling result in developmental defects, influence aging, neuro-degeneration and pathogenesis of human diseases caused by mtDNA mutations. We have taken a multi-disciplinary approach that exploits the genetic tools available in the fruit fly - Drosophila melanogaster , imaging techniques that enable real-time visualization of mitochondrial remodeling at a high resolution and biochemical analysis of isolated mitochondria to understand mitochondrial remodeling. Our studies have led to identification of novel mitochondrial proteins that regulate mitochondrial outer membrane fission and fusion (Figure). Using genetic mutants - and RNAi mediated knockdown - of these molecular players, the role of mitochondrial remodeling during cell division and in programmed cell death is being investigated. Cells defective in mitochondrial fission are protected from multiple apoptotic stimuli in vivo and ex vivo . At the level of the organism, developmental programmed cell death is reduced in these mutant animals resulting in tissue hyperplasia.Mechanisms of mitochondrial remodelingV.

Using high resolution fluorescence microscopy of genetically encoded GFP that is targeted to mitochondria or fluorescent dyes that are preferentially retained in the mitochondria, the number, cross sectional area and aspect ratio (shape) of mitochondria have been determined in vivo and ex vivo. Using time lapse imaging, mitochondrial fission and fusion have been characterized in primary larval hemocyte cultures that are amenable to genetic manipulations and S2r + cells that are amenable to rnai mediated gene knock-down studies. Mitochondria in multiple cell types are tubular-reticular and undergo fission and fusion (Figure 1). 2 Identification and characterization of proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion Shamik Banerjee, Tejas Gupte, Ruchika Anand and S. KokilavaniBiochemical and genetic studies performed in the laboratory led to the identification of candidate genes involved in mitochondrial remodeling. The role of 3 genes thus identified was studied in detail using rnai mediated knockdown of these genes individually in S2r + cells. Knock-down of these genes resulted in an increase in mitochondrial number and a concomitant decrease in mitochondrial cross sectional area and aspect ratio consistent with mitochondrial fragmentation. in order to test if fragmented mitochondrial morphology resulted from a defect in mitochondrial fusion, assays that monitor mitochondrial fusion were established using GFP and photo-activable GFP (PaGFP) that is targeted to the matrix of the mitochondria. GFP is photo-bleached in few mitochondria of the cell. The fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FraP) in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors is monitored with time and reflected exchange of GFP between mitochondria on fusion. in S2r + cells, P aGFP in a subset of mitochondria in a cell was photo-activated using a 405 nm laser and the redistribution of photo-activated P aGFP to other mitochondria monitored with time. Photo-activated PaGFP redistributed to majority of the mitochondria in the cell consistent with mitochondrial fusion. Unlike in mock rnai treated cells, photo-activated P aGFP did not redistribute in S2r+ cells treated with rnai that targeted the candidate genes isolated in the screen described above (Figure 2). Thus fragmented mitochondrial morphology in these cells resulted from a defect in mitochondrial fusion. The mechanism by which these proteins orchestrate mitochondrial outer membrane fusion subsequent to tethering of mitochondria that in turn is mediated by Mitofusin is being investigated. 3 Mechanism of Mitofusin mediated tethering of mitochondria Tejas Gupte, that has two heptad repeats (hr1 and hr2) that are implicated in tethering of mitochondria prior to fusion. it is not clear how Mitofusin on adjacent mitochondria interact in vivo and result in fusion. in order to address this question, assays in a subset of mitochondria (green) in the cell (0 hr- i, iii) is redistributed to all the mitochondria (red) in the cell as a result of mitochondrial fusion (1 hr- ii, iv) in mock rnai (i, ii) but not in candidate gene specific rnai (iii, iv) cell cultures have been developed. a bioinfomatic approach was taken to identify candidate amino acids in the heptad repeats of Mitofusin (Marf) essential for either the parallel or the anti-parallel interaction of the coiled-coil domains. Using PC r based site directed mutagenesis; we are testing experimentally if the hr1 and hr2 domains in different Marf molecules interact in a parallel or an anti-parallel orientation during the process of mitochondrial fusion.Collaborators: R. Sowdhamini and S. Ambika (NCBS) 4 Mechanism of mitochondrial inheritance during cell division Tejas Gupte and Arun KumarThe mechanism by which mitochondria are partitioned into daughter cells during cell division is poorly understood. it has been recently suggested that mitochondrial function plays a critical role in regulating mitosis. The objective is to characterize mitochondrial segregation and its function during mitosis. Using mitochondria targeted fluorescent proteins, changes in mitochondrial dynamics and morphology have been determined during cell division in S2r + cells. Preliminary studies show that mitochondria undergo dramatic fission during pro-metaphase and subsequently fuse post cytokinesis. Studies on the role that changes in mitochondrial morphology play during cell division are underway using rnai mediated knockdown of molecular players that regulate mitochondrial fission and fusion (Figure 3). 5 Role of mitochondrial remodeling during programmed cell death Gaurav Goyal and Nagaraju DhanyasiMitochondrial remodeling is essential for Drosophila cells to undergo death. Developmental programmed cell death stimuli in vivo and multiple apoptotic stimuli ex vivo induce mitochondrial fragmentation upstream of caspase activation. Unlike genotoxic stress, a lipid cell death mediator induced an increase in mitochondrial contiguity prior to fragmentation of the mitochondria (Figure 4). Using genetic mutants of drp-1, we find that Drp-1 not only regulates mitochondrial fission in normal cells, but mediates mitochondrial fragmentation during programmed cell death. Mitochondria in drp- 1 mutants fail to fragment, resulting in hyperplasia of tissues in vivo and protection of cells from multiple apoptotic stimuli ex vivo. We are currently investigating the functional role of mitochondrial fragmentation and increase in mitochondrial contiguity in programmed cell death. The concentration of mitochondrial calcium and a TP in the cell is measured for this purpose. Collaborators: Richard J Youle, NINDS, NIH, USA and Apurva Sarin, NCBS 6 Analysis of mitochondrial distribution in cells collaboration with Madan rao and abhishek Chaudhary at raman research institute, we are involved in the design of a coarse grain model of mitochondrial distribution in cells that is based on experimentally measurable parameters. This work is aimed at uncovering possible rules that underlie mitochondrial organization and function in the cell at a macroscopic scale and aimed at a subsequent analysis at a microscopic scale of tethering. Over-expression of Mitofusin (Marf)-GFP mutant (ii) results in reduced clumping (tethering) of mitochondria (red) unlike what is observed cell death. Developmental programmed cell death drives mitochondrial fragmentation in the pre- pupal mid-gut (ii). The average mitochondrial cross sectional area is indicated. in ex vivo preparations, etoposide induces mitochondrial (green) fragmentation (iii) while lipids induce extensively tubular mitochondrial morphology (iv) prior to fragmentation and cell death.

We are specifically interested in the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (insP3) and its receptor - the insP3 receptor. This protein exists on the membranes of intracellular calcium stores and performs the dual function of a receptor for insP 3 and a channel for calcium release. When insP3 is generated in the cell, in response to an external stimulus, it binds to the insP3 receptor and releases calcium from internal stores. We address insP3 receptor function in the model organism Drosophila using genetic, molecular, cellular, electrophysiological and behavioral methods.Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate signaling in cellular and systemic physiologyGAITI HASAN Intracellular Ca2+ levels in isolated Drosophila neurons loaded with a calcium sensitive fluorescent dye (Fluo-4).Nair, S., Agrawal, N. and Hasan, G.

By altering intracellular Ca2+ levels through genetic means, we have shown that signaling through the insP3r is required at multiple steps for generating the neural circuit required in air-puff stimulated Drosophila flight. Decreased Ca2+ release in aminergic neurons during development of the flight circuit can be compensated by reducing Ca2+ uptake from the cytosol to intracellular stores. however, this mode of increasing intracellular Ca2+ is insufficient for maintenance of flight patterns over time periods necessary for normal flight. Our study suggests that processes such as maintenance of wing posture and formation of the flight circuit require insP 3 receptor function at a slow time scale and can thus be modulated by altering levels of cytosolic Ca2+ and insP3. in contrast maintenance of flight patterns probably requires fast modulation of Ca2+ levels, where the intrinsic properties of the insP3r play a pivotal role. InsP3R function in Drosophila is downstream of Gq and PLC Santanu Banerjee and Neha AgrawalinsP 3 in vertebrates is generated in two cellular contexts, either by the activation of PLC or PLC. interestingly, in Drosophila none of the itpr mutant phenotypes were enhanced by reducing PLC activity suggesting that this arm of the insP3 pathway maybe non-functional in invertebrates. From genetic interaction studies with newly generated mutants for Gq and existing mutants for PLC (plc21C alleles) we propose that activation of the insP 3r is primarily through Gq and PLC in Drosophila. all itpr mutant phenotypes, except for the maintenance of flight patterns, are enhanced in dgq; itpr double mutants and further expression of a a tetrameric intracellular calcium channel. it is an integral component of the insP3 signaling pathway in multicellular organisms, where it regulates cellular calcium dynamics in many different contexts. in order to understand how the primary structure of the insP3r affects its functional properties, the kinetics of Ca2+-release in vitro from single point mutants of the Drosophila insP3r have been determined earlier. among these, the Ka901 mutant in the putative selectivity-filter of the pore is of particular interest. it is non-functional in the homomeric form whereas it forms functional channels (with altered channel properties) when co-expressed with wild-type channels. We now show that due to its changed functional properties the Ka901 mutant protein has dominant negative effects in vivo. Cells expressing Ka901:WT channels exhibit much higher levels of cytosolic Ca 2+ upon stimulation as compared with cells over-expressing just the wild-type DminsP3r, thus supporting our in vitro observations that increased Ca2+ release is a property of heteromeric Ka901:WT channels. Furthermore, ectopic expression of the Ka901 mutant channel in aminergic cells of Drosophila alters electrophysiological properties of a flight circuit and results in defective flight behavior.

Current Science, 89, 1220- 1229.Selected publicationsOrganisms show a fascinating variety of traits that allow them to survive and reproduce in nature. how do these adaptations work, and why are they so variable? To answer these questions one must understand evolution, because traits evolve over generations based on a trade-off between benefits and costs. Equally, one must understand ecology, because it is on the ecological stage that the evolutionary play is enacted. My particular interests include understanding the evolutionary ecology of conflict between individuals, both within species and between species. Conflicts of interest arise when an individual behaves in a way that is not optimal for others. i have studied conflicts within family- groups, and currently work on conflicts between brood parasites and their hosts. Conflicts of interest are also widespread when males and females make reproductive decisions. Sexual selection, the framework within which such decisions are studied, remains an interest of mine. i am also interested in the application of evolutionary thinking (adaptation, trade-offs, conflicts of interests, life-history strategies) to ecological questions: What are the population consequences of environmental change? how do inducible defences affect population trajectories? What are the causes and consequences of invasions by non-native species into new environments? My approach in tackling these questions is to combine theory with empirical work. Formal modelling focusses hypotheses and predictions, and forces unstated assumptions into the open; empirical tests of predictions lead to refined models of how the world works. i intend that members of my lab work in a diversity of systems: terrestrial and aquatic, plant and animal. We conduct observations and experiments in the field; and, where greater control is required, in artificial environments, mimicking natural conditions as closely as possible.Evolutionary ecology aDEr1 Antagonistic co-evolution: brood parasites and their hosts This work focusses on the strategies shown by avian brood parasites and the counter-strategies of their hosts. Brood parasites lay their eggs in the nests of other species, thereby taking advantage of the parental efforts of the hosts. What explains the large variation in virulence of avian brood parasites? What adaptations make brood parasites successful at their deception? how do parasitic chicks manage to manipulate their foster parents into providing for them? and, on the other hand, what defences do hosts have against brood parasites? 2 Individual adaptations and population ecology: mosquito behaviour and population dynamics Overall population change results from variation in the survival and reproduction of individuals. The more we understand this variation, the better we will be able to predict future population change. For this, we need to study the evolved tactics of individuals to survive and reproduce, and how these tactics are influenced by the environment. When predation risk and competition vary in space, how do female mosquitoes decide where to lay their eggs? how do larvae adjust their behavioural and life- history tactics? Can we incorporate this information into our models to better understand population dynamics? 3 Causes and consequences of invasions: the ecology and evolution of invasive species Species that have successfully colonised new environments provide a wonderful opportunity to study the evolutionary process of adaptation, and the ecological process of competition and its consequences. What makes invasive species successful: release from ecological constraints (pathogens, predators, competitors), or rapid adaptation? What effects do invasives have on native species, and through what mechanisms? Does a detailed understanding of the evolution and ecology of problem species allow us to design better control measures?

NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 71 7/10/08 5:34:07 PMThe indian subcontinent is a fascinating place. Bound by mountain ranges to the north, the northeast and the northwest and by ocean to the south, this peninsula is home to incredible biodiversity. Data on species distributions suggests that the indian subcontinent is a sink for species from other regions, with some of its own native species. if the indian subcontinent is a sink, this should be mirrored in the genetic diversity of species found here, which would be lower (and relatively recent) compared to that of the same species elsewhere. We seek to investigate the distribution and partitioning of genetic diversity for various mammalian species in the indian subcontinent, and investigate processes that drive patterns of genetic diversity across space and time. We also strive to apply molecular methods to address important issues in the conservation of endangered species. Using field-collected samples, molecular genetic tools and computationally intensive analyses, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of populations and species, and predict the driving forces in their future evolution. We have spent the last year discovering diversity in north-eastern india. Our research has identified the phylogenetic affiliations of the newly discovered arunachal macaque, two species of barking deer not known from india (leaf deer: James et al., in press; black muntjac) and allowed us to infer ancestry in northeastern native human populations. We have investigated genetic variability among tigers in india, and find that tigers outside retain much less variability than do tigers within india. The genetic data also reveal a very recent, possibly human induced, population decline. We are currently investigating genetic variability in leopards, jungle cats, bonnet and arunachal macaques and house mice. Finally, we have excavated fossil rodents from a Pleistocene site in Southern india, Kurnool caves, and are currently characterizing change in small mammal communities through time. in our attempts to conserve species, we have developed methods to identify tigers and leopards individually from non-invasive samples. We are currently applying these methods to estimate population density for tigers in Karnataka.

Over the last couple of years, we have applied molecular approaches to the discovery of biodiversity in this species rich region. a new species of primate, the arunachal macaque Macaca munzala, was described from northeastern india in 2005. Based on its appearance and distribution, the arunachal macaque was hypothesized to be closely related to M. assamensis and M. thibetana. Molecular analyses in our laboratory established the distinct identity of the species and indicate a time of origin of c. 0.48 mya. Surprisingly, maternally inherited markers reveal close phylogenetic affinities with the Southern indian bonnet macaque (M. radiata), while the Y chromosome revealed shared ancestry with the geographically closer assamese and thibetan macaques, possibly mediated by ancestral male introgression. Morphometric analyses reiterate similarity between M. munzala and its neighbors, presumably resulting from convergent evolution under similar ecological conditions. We are continuing research on the arunachal macaque, and are investigating population structure and demographic history using mitochondrial Dna and microsatellite variation. The leaf deer Muntiacus putaoensis was discovered in Myanmar and its presence in eastern arunachal Pradesh, india, was subsequently confirmed based on morphometric analyses of two skulls collected from local hunters. however, ambiguity remained regarding several other partial skulls and dried skin samples collected during subsequent surveys. We developed molecular genetic analyses that can unambiguously identify muntjac species. analyses of the collected skins revealed the presence of three muntjac species in arunachal Pradesh: the indian muntjac, the leaf deer and the black muntjac. These results increased the muntjac diversity of the indian subcontinent from one (only the common muntjac) to three species. Further, it doubled the size of the leaf deer's east-west range. Our discovery of the black muntjac in this region are surprising given this species is previously known only from eastern China. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the indian population is reciprocally monophyletic with the Chinese population. Given genetic differences and current geographical isolation between these populations, we suggest that the indian population of the black muntjac be considered a management unit. Our research highlights the importance of molecular tools in facilitating the discovery of cryptic biodiversity as well as in determining conservation status of populations in such understudied regions.

Scientific conservation efforts thus far have focused on better understanding tiger ecology. a recent phylogeographic study revealed six subspecies of tigers, with moderate levels of genetic variation. Given that around 50% of the worlds tigers are in the indian subcontinent, we further investigated genetic variation in this region. So far, we have sampled 43 wild individuals from across the indian subcontinent. Sequence data from 1.3 Kbp for 57 individuals reveal much higher levels of genetic variation within india than previously suggested. When compared to tigers outside of india, we found that around 70% of all genetic variation was within the indian subcontinent. The additional diversity we discovered was because we collected non-invasive samples across tiger populations in india, unlike the previous study where sampling was geographically restricted. This result is especially relevant given that off the remaining global tiger habitat, less than 5% is occupied by indian tigers. We further investigated demographic history and used coalescent simulations to estimate the historical effective population size of tigers in the india. We are currently using microsatellite variation to characterize the severity of the very recent anthropogenic decline. in future research, we hope to extensively investigate population structure in the indian subcontinent, and use historical skin samples to investigate recently extinct genetic variants. We are also investigating population structure in other species in the indian subcontinent. For example, leopards are an interesting contrast to tigers in being relatively more adundant and widespread. Jungle cats and leopard cats are more abundant than leopards or tigers, but have very different habitat preferences. Bonnet macaques seem to be continuously distributed. We are currently investigating the effects of these ecological differences on genetic variation using microsatellite data from non-invasive samples. The house mouse is hypothesized to have evolved in the indian subcontinent. We have just initiated research investigating the phylogeography of the house mouse. in the future, we hope to investigate possible genetic signatures of increase in abundance with commensalism. Given that Mus musculus is a model system, we are very excited by this new research direction, as it will allow us to tap genomic resources and possibly examine genes directly involved in evolution. 3 Human population genetics Thejaswi Shivanadapart from being the only point of entry into peninsular india from east and southeast asia, northeast india is also a hotspot of linguistic and ethno-cultural diversity.

Genetic data included mitochondrial hVS1 sequences from these individuals and published data (over 1400 sequences) from other tribes in Meghalaya and other parts of this region. Our results reveal population growth among these tribes, contrary to most hunter-gatherer groups elsewhere across the world, and that ethno-religious tradition could be a significant isolating factor in geographically proximate populations. Using coalescent simulations we investigated divergence times between these tribes and those from peninsular india and southeastern China. Our simulations reveal that the northeast indian tribes could have colonized the region relatively recently, having a more recent shared ancestry with Chinese tribes than peninsular indian tribes. We propose that for human populations the northeast is best viewed as a sink rather than a corridor or barrier to gene flow. Collaborator: B.R.

Indrani Suryaprakash and Krishnapriya Tammain February of 2007, we excavated a cave site close to Kurnool, in andhra Pradesh, Southern india. Our initial explorations reveal that the materials we excavated represent a rich assemblage of small mammal fauna from this region. We are now in the process of dating layers in the excavated remains, cleaning and identifying the recovered small mammals jaws. We are also testing the feasibility of using the material we have recovered as a source of ancient Dna. Longer-term, we hope to use excavation materials like these to investigate how changes in climate have impacted the ecology and evolution of small mammal communities in the past in the indian subcontinent.Collaborators: Elizabeth Hadly, Stanford University and Anthony Barnosky, UC Berkeley, USA 5 Conservation genetics Samrat Mondol The survival of tigers in the indian subcontinent is threatened. in the recent years, non-invasive genetic samples like scat have served as an invaluable tool to study the population status of rare and elusive species. We have developed genetic methods to identify species, gender and individuals. We are currently working with scat samples collected in a mark-recapture framework to estimate population density in Bandipur national Park. Bandipur is a good site to test our methods, as Dr. Karanth and others at WCS have studied this population for many years, and have independent estimates of population density. in future research, we hope to extend the geographical scope of our research to the Western ghats in Karnataka. We hope to combine genetic and ecological research to investigate tiger habitat preference, tiger density in key regions, and connectivity between different parts of this landscape. We believe that such research will be critical for the conservation of tigers.

We are interested in deciphering mechanisms that ensure integrity of circuits within adult animals. What are the changes that must occur within individual neurons to maintain homeostasis and how do these properties change to allow plasticity? The Drosophila olfactory system presents several advantages that allows us to address these issues. The circuit which is composed of sensory neurons, local interneurons, projection neurons and modulatory neurons is anatomically well defined and is amenable to a range of genetic strategies available in the fly (Figure below). Odor quality is largely represented as a 3-dimensional spatial code in the brain and the basic cell types and underlying cellular organization is well described. Building upon this knowledge, we are now investigating how this collection of neurons function to result in behavior.Developmental Landraf, M., VijayRaghavan, K. and Rodrigues, V. ( 2007). Metamorphosis of an identified serotonergic neuron in the Drosophila olfactory system. Neural Development, 2, 20. The olfactory circuit in Drosophila indicating classes of neurons as well as (in green) P(Gal4) lines that mark them. Selected publication OniC a rODriGUES1 neural activity is necessary for maintenance of adult olfactory circuits Albert Chiang The mechanisms that underlie maintenance of adult circuits are not well understood in any system. The role of neural activity during development is better studied in the vertebrate olfactory system, where activity along with odorant receptor identity, specifies the combination of adhesive and repulsive cues that result in the maturation of the sensory map. We used a conditional system to express any of a panel of neural-activity blockers in the adult Drosophila olfactory neurons and observed a disruption of axonal terminals within antennal lobe glomeruli (Figure 1). To understand how activity maintains neural elements, we searched for molecules whose levels are regulated in an activity-dependent manner and identified the homophilic adhesion molecules Fas2, n-Cadherin and neuroglian. in the presynaptic terminals of olfactory receptor neurons, where synaptic function is blocked, Fas2 and neuroglian are upregulated while n-Cadherin is downregulated. Our results suggest that the maintenance of sensory inputs to the glomerular map is an active process in vivo, requiring neural activity during adulthood. in order to link activity to cell adhesion molecules, we have initiated a screen using U aS-rnai lines kindly provided by ryu Ueda at the national institute of Genetics, Japan and by Barry Dickson at the research institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna. We have obtained some candidate genes whose 'knock-down' in sensory neurons or in glial cells results in synapse withdrawal or degeneration. These are being investigated currently. Collaborator: K. VijayRaghavan, NCBS 2 Re-modeling of an identified serotonergic neuron during pupal life is regulated by activity and Wingless signaling Bidisha Roy and Ajeet P . Singh it is likely that many of the mechanisms employed during metamorphosis of neurons are shared with those involved in adult plasticity and may also provide knowledge about neural degeneration. We therefore decided to examine molecular mechanisms that control the re-modeling of a wide-field serotonergic neuron in the Drosophila olfactory pathway which undergoes dramatic changes from larva to adult. Modification of a larval neuron into its adult-specific form is regulated by steroid hormone receptors, neuronal activity, signalling through the Wingless pathway and Ephrins (Figure 2). These studies establish a cellular system for studying how extrinsic cues interact with autonomous signals to pattern complex cellular architecture. Parallel studies aimed at deciphering the function of this neuron will link anatomy to the development of olfactory behaviour. Collaborator: K.

NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 77 7/10/08 5:34:11 PM3 Mechanisms of Short-term and in olfactory pathway Sudeshna Das, Avni Gandhi and Somdatta Karnik We have devised behavioral paradigms that allow us to study two forms of non-associative memory which we term Long Term habituation (LT h) and Short Term habituation (ST h). in LT h, newly eclosed flies are exposed for several days to the odor of benzaldehyde or to Carbon dioxide. The normal repulsive response to these stimuli is severely diminished and recovers only after eight to ten days. ST h, on the other hand is more robustly measured in larvae where five minute pre-exposure to odorants results in a drop in response which recovers within an hour. We are dissecting the cellular basis of these behavioral observations using P(Gal4) lines that allow us to manipulate the properties of individual cells within the circuit. Electrophysiological studies and functional imaging techniques from several laboratories suggest that local interneurons serve to integrate information among different glomeruli suggesting that these could be the substrates for generation of LT h and ST h. We have initiated an analysis using the mosaic analysis with repressible cell marker (M arCM) method to study the lineage and architecture of individual local interneurons (Ln) (Figure 3). The presence of a Or-GFP fusion constructs in the background of the Gal4 line that marks Ln allows us to trace arborizations to individual identified 3b).

There are several reported examples of chemical cues triggering diverse behavior patterns that can be modified within short timescales. We have initiated experiments to study the development and function of the olfactory system in the ant Campotonus sericeus which relies heavily on olfaction for its lifestyle. antibodies against Drosophila synaptic proteins label synapses in the ant brain and allowed us to visualize the organization of the olfactory lobe in different castes (Figure 4). Unlike that in flies, the olfactory lobe of ants shows sexual dimorphism - the male has a macroglomerulus, presumably involved in detection of sex pheromones and about 75 smaller glomeruli. The worker on the other hand, has about 175 glomeruli of similar size and the queen possesses 115 glomeruli. A\u0000 B\u0000Figure 3.

We use Drosophila for our studies of emerging behavior, since Drosophila provides us with a wealth of genetic tools and reagents with which to study the development and function of the nervous system. We focus our investigation on the embryo because this is the developmental stage when neural circuits begin to mature and the coordinated outputs that drive movement first appear. Our aims at this stage are 1) to identify genes essential for the normal development of movement 2) to identify elements of the neural circuitry underlying locomotor movements 3) to investigate the emergence of function in the motor system and how this is controlled. We have completed our first level of genetic analysis by showing that patterns of movement that are specific to particular body regions are specified by the local expression of hox genes (Dixit et al 2008). Loss of hox gene function leads to a loss of the normal pattern of local movement; gain of function leads to the ectopic expression of movements characteristic of a different body region. We conclude that hox genes regulate the region specific differentiation of neural networks that drive coordinated movement and a major challenge now is to translate this finding into a deeper understanding of how such control is exerted at a cellular and molecular level. at the same time a major screen aimed at identifying components of the motor circuitry that are essential for specific patterns of movement has been carried out using a loss of function approach. The results of this screen are promising: a large number of lines that are either paralysed or show defective patterns of behavior when tetanus toxin is targeted to specific subsets of neurons has been identified. Many of the neuronal subsets identified in this way are relatively small and restricted and should allow us to catalogue and manipulate essential components of both locomotor circuitry and its upstream control. This work is complemented by and interacts with work in Cambridge that is particularly concerned with the progressive emergence of coordinated movement in late embryogenesis. This work indicates an essential role for neural activity in the proper development of coordinated movement. This finding is reflected at a cellular level by the discovery of an apparently homeostatic mechanism that regulates the growth of postsynaptic elements of motor circuitry in response to the level of synaptic input they receive. We conclude that the developing motor circuitry shows an unexpected degree of plasticity that allows for compensation in the face of naturally occurring variability.Primary affiliation: Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, UK adjunct faculty 79 NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 79 7/10/08 5:34:12 PMSelected publications vijay@ncbs.res.inNerves, muscles and the development of behaviourK. VIJAYRAGHA V AN Our laboratory is interested in understanding the mechanisms underlying development and assembly of the network-comprising nerves, muscles and tendons - responsible for the ability of animals to move from one place to another by crawling, walking or flying. Our approach is to analyze this problem - using genetic and molecular tools - by first understanding the mechanisms that specify the birth of motor neurons, their morphogenesis and relationship to their input neurons and target muscles. This cellular analysis has begun to yield results on the developmental genetic basis underlying the construction of hardware. We are, in parallel, addressing which aspects of the network are essential for function and, importantly, the ways in which function is robust, and resilient to perturbations in structure and development. These experiments have required the careful development of assays of locomotor behaviour. alterations in behaviour upon induced changes in gene expression in sensory-or motor-neurons are then measured to understand how 'function' is built into the network during development.

We address the following questions: What are the developmental origins of motor neurons? are they all parts of one or a few neural lineages or are they selected from several lineages and specified individually? Our results demonstrate that motor neurons of the leg arise primarily from two groups of cells: one born during the embryonic phase of neurogenesis and the other during post- embryonic development. Thus far, analysis of the embryonic born motor neurons shows that three motor neurons innervate three distinct muscles sets of the leg (Figure 1). These identified neurons are being followed from larval to adult development in order to understand their development in relation to their targets.Collaborators: David Brierly and Darren Williams, King's College, UK 2 Understanding the walking-fly Sudhir Pallayil, Swetha, B., and Umashankar The long-term goals of the project are to identify the neuronal elements that are required for walking in Drosophila and how they are assembled during development. We have devised assays to analyze walking behavior in different levels of detail. The gross parameters, such as speed and rate of turning. are obtained using a video-tracking arena. at a finer level, we examine the footprints of a fly, left behind on a soot- covered glass plate, which allows us to look at step length, leg positioning, and co-ordination. For further detail, we examine an immobilized fly rotating a Styrofoam ball (Figure 2). in this assay, we can obtain additional parameters such as gait-, inter-leg co-ordination and inter-segment co-ordination. Using these assays, we have studied the behavior of the mature adult, newly emerged adults, animals with legs amputated and animals with parts of the nervous system functionally silenced with tetanus toxin. These experiments, as yet in early stages, will help us develop a picture of how the development of the leg motor system is related to its function in the adult. We have also generated a range of genetic tools that allow us to affect the function and gene-expression in defined sets of neurons. When used in our behavior assays we expect these tools to help us develop an understanding of how segment- specific wiring of function, results in co-ordinated walking. to understand the development of locomotion in Drosophila larva. Our study has two aspects: the analysis of rhythmic peristaltic movement patterns in the embryo and the crawling motion of the larva after hatching which the embryonic movement prefigures. Our aims are to identify the neuronal components of central pattern generators and examine the mechanisms underlying the functional development of larval locomotor behaviour. We speculate that the locomotor network is repeated in a segmental fashion along the antero- posterior axis of the larva. Our working hypothesis is that segmental variants of a fundamental circuit plan will be dictated by the action of the homeotic genes. in order to test the importance of segment identity, we have carried out studies involving loss - as well as gain - of function of homeotic genes of the bithorax (BX-C) and antennapedia (ant-C). results obtained suggest that either Ultrabithorax (Ubx) or abdominal-A (abdA), two genes of bithorax complex (BX-C) are necessary and sufficient to dictate the characteristic movements that are associated with peristaltic locomotion. in order to dissect the minimal neuronal components underlying peristaltic behaviour, a functional screen is being carried out. Using the GAL4 system to silence neurons we identify lines with narrow expression domains in the nervous system but impaired peristaltic movements. in addition to this, we also identify GAL4 lines in which the control of larval crawling on substrate is affected in multiple Figure 1.

Guruharsha The myoblast attractant gene dumbfounded ( duf; also called kirre) is an important player during myoblast fusion in Drosophila. it is specifically expressed in specialized set of cells called founder myoblasts that seed the formation of muscles. Using a combination of in silico approaches, we have identified potential cis-regulatory elements in the sequence upstream of duf coding region. Putative binding sites for several transcription factors and nuclear effectors of major signaling pathways were found clustered and phylogenetically conserved in this region. Systematic deletion analysis of the duf- regulatory region using reporter constructs revealed specific aspects of duf regulation during Drosophila myogenesis. We find several distinct, independent and non- cumulative enhancer modules- that regulate duf expression in specific muscle founder cells of the embryo and the adult. While embryonic enhancers are proximal, adult-specific enhancers are located more distal to the duf start site. These results merited a further, detailed computational study of the duf enhancer region. The results have complemented our study by identifying enhancer modules and transcription factors whose predicted binding regions match with our deletion analysis. We demonstrate the complexity of duf gene regulation and examine this in the context of Bioinformatics and Chi P-on-Chip studies. These reveal contexts where the predictive and Chi P-on-Chip approaches have great value and others where, clearly, more information is needed before predictive tools can be applied.

These studies implicate Wsp as playing a role during myoblast fusion in adult muscle development and provides a genetic handle for the identification of other interacting molecules involved in myoblast fusion (Figure 4).Collaborators: Eyal Schjeter and Ben-Zion Shilo, Weizmann Israel and tendon cells Prabhat Tiwari and Arun KumarThe mechanisms by which developing muscles and tendon- precursors interact to form precise myotendonous junctions, essential for correct movement, has been poorly investigated in vertebrates but examined substantially in Drosophila. Studies in developing abdominal muscles. Scale bar=50 \u00b5m. Figure 4. Myobast (red, arrowhead) fusing with a developing muscle fibre in WT when compared to that stripe expressing tendon- precursors and developing muscles interact through the EGF- signaling pathway. Explorations in the embryo and in the adult have suggested that hh and Wnt signaling, respectively, could have a role in the matching of specific muscle- tendon- interactions. We are examining identified signaling pathways in adult muscle- tendon interaction in Drosophila. We use stripe-Gal4 to perturb selected molecules in tendon cells. Perturbation of the Wnt signaling myotubes pathway in muscle attachment sites affects the migration of myotubes towards their attachment sites. inhibition of EGFr signaling in tendon cells using dominant negative receptor affects tendon cell projections. We have marked muscles and tendons with differential labels and, in this background, have started a large scale- screen of U aS-rnai lines (obtained from niG Japan) to identify molecules in the establishment of myo- tendonous junctions. We use MhC-Gal4 and stripe-Gal4 to express the rnai lines in muscle and tendon cells respectively. The approach is to look for the lethality and any other easily scorable phenotype first and then to examine their role in detail. We have picked up several interesting molecules, which show either lethality or flight defects, and these are being examined in detail. 7 The protein complex map of GuruharshaDifferences in complexity between organisms are not completely dependent on the number of genes in the genome but rather on how these genes interact in the cellular and organismal environment. Thus, understanding how gene products interact and indeed the rules that govern such interactions is an essential element in dissecting the cellular function of biological systems. Multi-protein complexes carry out most cellular processes. The identification and composition of such complexes is crucial for understanding how the ensemble of expressed proteins (the Proteome) is organized into functional units. Proteins interact with each other to build up networks that govern cellular functions. Defining these networks is an essential part of gaining a molecular understanding of how cellular behavior dictates the development and physiology of an organism. The goal of this project is to establish a complete protein interaction map of the Drosophila proteome based on the isolation and Mass spectrometric analysis of purified protein complexes associated with individually tagged proteins. The project involves a systematic retrieval and analysis of cellular protein complexes in sufficient quantities for biochemical analysis of their components. This will determine the first complete metazoan proteome map beyond the level of binary protein interactions. We are generating stable transgenic fly lines that can express tagged proteins in regulated manner to understand protein complexes in different cellular/ tissue contexts. The results we obtain from these studies will not only benefit the Drosophila community but will be of fundamental interest and practical use to a very broad spectrum of researchers.Collaborators: Spyros Artavanis-Tsakonas, Harvard Medical School, USA; Drosophila Genome Project, L.S.

We combine experiments and computer models to understand complex neural behavior starting from molecular interactions and culminating in behavior. Our laboratory is looking at two specific brain functions: the sense of smell, and memory. The sense of smell Three of the key features of an odorant are its intensity, identity, and location. Somehow the brain extracts many kinds of olfactory information from the complex, intermittent flux of chemicals that constitutes an odorant stimulus. We have used imaging, electrical recordings, and odor-guided behavior to analyze olfactory neural processing. We are developing computational models that build upon our experimental results and basic biophysical laws, to understand how the brain arrives at a complete picture of the olfactory world. Memory Memory is characterized by stability, robustness, and the ability to recall complete memories from minimal cues. it is a challenge to understand how such attributes arise from noisy, lossy, and diffusive chemistry at the junctions between brain cells. We have used electrical and optical recordings, and high-resolution microscopy, to map out some of these chemical circuits. We are working toward building a biologically detailed computational model of memory, from molecules to the network.Computational neuroscienceUPINDER S.

Clement and Ashesh DhawaleWe study how brain activity encodes three key dimensions of an odorant stimulus: intensity, identity and location. Using electrical recordings, we have measured rat olfactory bulb responses to odorant stimuli under a wide range of concentrations and in mixtures. We have identified a likely encoding scheme that accurately describes the firing patterns of 80% of recorded neurons to any combination and concentration of two odorants. This may account for intensity and identity encoding. We have also identified laterality in response properties that rapidly and accurately predicts the location of odorants. This may provide the third dimension, that of odor location, in the olfactory bulb. To go from single-unit to network-level encoding, we have built an in-vivo 2-photon system for optically recording from many cells simultaneously. b. Behavior Raghav Rajan, Urvashi Raheja and K. Parthasarathyrats are excellent at tracking odors, such as food, to their source. By studying rats trained to push sensors depending on odor direction, we have shown that rats can locate odors using stereo cues. They compare the intensity and time of arrival in each nostril, to determine the location of the odor source. They can identify multiple odors and respond in a different way to each. We find that rats can do this in under 200 msec, comparable to the reaction time of a trained athlete. Do they use this ability in nature? We have trained rats to navigate toward an odor source in a laminar air-flow arena to test the contribution of stereo and rapid odor processing in natural odor-location strategies. c. Models Subhasis Ray, Niraj Dudani, Rinaldo D'Souza and U.S. BhallaThe cellular and network physiology of the olfactory bulb is among the best characterized in the brain. With this data we propose that we can predict the emergence of representations of odor identity, intensity, and location from the first principles of cellular biophysics. We are building one of the largest-ever simulations of any brain structure, where we plan to model the entire olfactory bulb with particular attention to biophysical detail. This model will be calibrated against our own and other data, and will run on our 260-node supercomputer. 2 Memory a. PhysiologySriram M. Ajay and Dhanya Parameshwaranhow do memory-triggered signals spread through the neuron? We have used electrical recordings and immunohistochemistry in the hippocampal slice to map out the extent and mechanisms of this spread. We examined a series of possible models by comparing computer predictions with experiments, to show that both synaptic and voltage-gated calcium influx contributes to the activity spread. We are also approaching the issue of spatial extent of memory signals from the network perspective, using optical recordings and multiple stimulus points to read out many synaptic responses in parallel. b Models Pragati Jain, Arnold Hayer, Priyamvada Rajasethupathy and U.S. BhallaComplex chemical circuits mediate the subcellular steps that give rise to memory. One mechanism for this is when chemical circuits act like memory switches, which can stably persist in either of two states (on or off). While computationally analyzing the movement of molecules in the synapse, we unexpectedly discovered that such a switch emerged from the regulated movement of neurotransmitter receptors. We showed that this switch could retain its state for over a year despite molecular noise, diffusion and turnover. We are modeling the synaptic activity-dependent control of protein synthesis through Figure 1. Image of neurons from hippocampus taken with custom-built 2-photon microscope Figure 2.

Finally, in a collaboration with naren ramakrishnan at Virginia Tech, we are systematically exploring chemical space to find such bistable switches. 3 Computational brain is too complex to understand unaided. We have developed an extensive set of tools and on-line resources to model the brain. The Database of Quantitative Cellular Signaling (DOQCS) was one of the first databases of the chemical systems in the brain, and we have enhanced its capabilities to include multiple file formats (Matlab and SBML) as well as improved searches. The DOQCS database is now twinned with the BioModels database at EB i. We are also developing a way to generally specify experiments and their outcomes, to drive models in a database and test how accurate their results are. b. Simulation software Subhasis Ray, Niraj Dudani and U.S. BhallaThe challenging goal of modeling brain function requires the use of powerful computers, and new kinds of software that can model at many levels of detail and do so transparently from laptops to supercomputers. The Messaging Object Oriented Simulation Environment, MOOSE, is a new simulator that supports this. MOOSE is backward compatible with the old GEn ESiS simulator, but is a complete redesign with much greater power and usability. MOOSE is designed to easily plug in optimized numerical engines to perform very fast computations, while retaining transparent parallelization. MOOSE works with modern scripting languages like Python and handles standard XML-based data formats for model specification.Collaborators: Z.

Memories come in many different flavors, some more potent than others. Unconscious emotional memories of fearful experiences, formed in a brain structure called the amygdala, appear to leave an indelible mark that may last for a lifetime. The rapid and efficient encoding of fear memories by the amygdala help us cope with threatening stimuli in the future, but it also comes with a high price tag. These emotional memories etched into the amygdalar circuitry can also become maladaptive. For example, high anxiety and mood lability are cardinal symptoms of many stress disorders. What are the cellular mechanisms underlying these powerful emotional symptoms? We are addressing this question using a range of behavioral, morphometric, in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological tools. We find that chronic stress causes excitatory neurons of the amygdala to have larger dendritic arbors with more synaptic contacts on them. These newly formed synapses are endowed with a greater proportion of a receptor molecule that mediates emotional memory formation in the amygdala. Under normal conditions, these excitatory neurons are kept in check by synaptic inhibition. But, whenever stress enhances anxiety, it also lowers inhibitory tone in the amygdala. interestingly, drugs that help protect against stress, also prevent many of these synaptic changes. Thus, our findings suggest that stress creates an ideal synaptic substrate in the amygdala for imprinting powerful fear memories, which become a source of persistent and intense anxiety. in addition to behavioral experience, the genes we inherit can also cause cognitive and emotional dysfunction. hence, we are extending our analyses to genetically engineered mice to identify molecular targets that may help correct symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome, the leading genetic cause of autism.Plasticity in the amygdala: implications for stress disorders and mental SUMANTRA McEwen and Molecular Neurobiology: Behavioral Neurochemistry S. and Bear, M.F.

Chronic stress strengthens the structural and physiological basis of synaptic connectivity in the lateral amygdala by enhancing dendritic arbors (left), spine density (center), and currents mediated by nMD a receptors (right) in projection neurons.Selected publications 800 600 400 200 0 -200 -400 pA 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.0 s \u0014\u0010\u0010\u0000P!\u0000\u0010\u000e\u0011\u0000S\u0000 NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 90 7/10/08 5:34:32 PM91 SUM anT ra C ha TTarJ i1 Impact of chronic stress on excitatory pyramidal neurons in the lateral amygdala (La), we are examining the electrophysiological properties of spines formed by chronic immobilization stress (CiS, 2h/day for 10 days). We find that stress amplifies the ratio of nMD a to aMPa receptor mediated excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs). Further, the ratio of coefficient of variation (CV) is smaller in stress-treated cells when the CV of evoked aMPa and nMD a EPSCs is compared in the same cell. This decrease in CV ratio in stressed neurons is only due to a decrease in the CV of nMD a-EPSC, reflecting a larger number of nMD a receptor synapses contributing to the EPSC. analysis of mixed miniature EPSCs with aMPa and nMD a components also suggests that the increase in evoked nMD a currents is due to addition of nMD a receptors to newly formed spines that do not contain aMPars. Thus, chronic stress appears to create nMD a-only or \"silent synapses\" in the La, which in turn could enhance their capacity for subsequent potentiation. indeed, nMD a receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP), a synaptic plasticity mechanism for learning and memory, is amplified after chronic stress. We are now studying the molecular mechanisms underlying these cellular changes. 2 Stress-induced modulation of fear memory and its in vivo encoding in single neurons Supriya Ghosh and Anupratap TomarStress induced formation of silent synapses and enhancement of LTP is expected to amplify the functional output of the La. We use Pavlovian auditory fear conditioning to examine the extent to which stress modulates learning and memory of emotional events. The same pairing of auditory tones with weak footshock that only elicits moderate levels of freezing in unstressed rats causes significantly greater freezing in previously stressed rats (Figure 1a). hence, stress-induced generation of silent synapses may shift amygdalar cells to a state where their capacity for subsequent potentiation is enhanced, thereby creating an ideal synaptic substrate for affective disorders. These studies, however, are limited by the fact that function is inferred from analysis at the cellular and behavioral levels without any online readout of dynamic changes in neuronal activity in the intact animal. To bridge this gap, we are recording extracellular action potential firing simultaneously from multiple La neurons in awake, behaving rats. Such single-unit recordings from La neurons show robust increases in tone responses after fear conditioning (Figure 1b), thereby enabling us to monitor how neural encoding of fear memories in the amygdala is modulated during and after stressful experiences of varying duration and intensity. These in vivo multi-electrode recordings are being extended to study the impact of stress on \"place cells\" in the hippocampus. Figure 1. (a) Stress enhances consolidation of memory formed after auditory fear conditioning. (b) Fear conditioning induces increase in tone-evoked spike firing in lateral amygdala neurons, monitored using multi-channel single-unit recording system episode of stress on synaptic inhibition Aparna SuvrathanWhile the above results suggest a role for stress-induced modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission in enhancing fear, inhibitory synaptic transmission also regulates functional output of the amygdala. hence, we are analyzing the relationship between stress, anxiety and synaptic inhibition in the La. The same chronic stress that enhances anxiety causes a reduction in G aBaergic inhibitory currents in La principal neurons. Strikingly, this inverse relation between anxiety and synaptic inhibition emerges even when animals are exposed to a single 2-hour episode of stress. although this brief stress has no significant effect on anxiety a day later, it leads to higher anxiety 10 days later. Strikingly, there is a significant reduction in the mean amplitude and frequency of miniature G aBaergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mi PSCs) in La principal neurons only 10 days, but not a day, after acute stress. Thus, gradual suppression of synaptic inhibition in the La parallels the slow build-up of anxiety even after a brief stressor. 4 From animal models to therapeutic strategies results on the delayed effects of acute stress have led to animal models that capture various aspects of emotional disorders, such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), in humans. Treatment with the anxiolytic diazepam before acute stress prevents reduction in synaptic inhibition, spinogenesis, and enhanced anxiety 10 days after acute stress. Strikingly, diazepam given after acute stress also reverses the decrease in synaptic inhibition 10 days later. Further, corticosterone treatment preceding acute stress blocks the eventual increase in anxiety and La spine-density. Conversely, in adrenalectomized animals acute stress leads to even greater anxiety, which can be attenuated with corticosterone treatment. These animal studies are consistent with clinical reports showing that cortisol treatment reduces the cardinal symptoms of PTSD. Since stress and emotional trauma have been implicated in depressive disorders, we are also analyzing the synaptic and behavioral effects of antidepressants, such as fluoxetine and tianeptine, on the amygdala. 5 Negative versus positive experiences Ruchi MalikEnvironmental enrichment (EE) - consisting of increased exercise, social interactions and exposure to objects that encourage exploration - is known to have beneficial effects in the cortex and hippocampus of the rodent brain, e.g. enhanced dendritic arbors, spine density, LTP , and learning. Paradoxically, we observed the same effects in the amygdala, not as a result of a positive experience like EE, but after an aversive experience like chronic stress. This raises an intriguing question - how would the amygdala respond to EE? if EE elicits cellular changes in the amygdala similar to the hippocampus, then our earlier results predict EE to enhance anxiety and fear learning. But one expects positive experiences to reduce fear and anxiety. On the other hand, if EE does reduce fear and anxiety, would it induce cellular changes in the amygdala that are different from the hippocampus? indeed, we find that EE decreases amygdala-dependent auditory fear conditioning, as well as anxiety. But, EE does not enhance spine density in the La. in contrast, the same EE enhances hippocampal spine density and contextual fear conditioning. Thus, plasticity elicited by a positive experience also appear to be different in the amygdala. 6 Reversal of symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome Aparna Suvrathan and Sonal KediaFragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most commonly inherited form of mental retardation and the leading genetic cause of autism, is caused by transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene. although moderate to severe cognitive impairment is a key feature of FXS, patients also display severe problems related to anxiety, attention deficit, and hyperactivity. The Fmr1-knockout (KO) mouse is a powerful animal model for investigating symptoms of human FXS. We have examined two NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 92 7/10/08 5:34:32 PM93 molecular targets that hold promise in developing new treatments for FXS. in one study, we were able to rescue a range of cellular and behavioral abnormalities observed in Fmr1-KO mice by employing a genetic strategy to inhibit activity of p21-activated kinase (P aK), which is critical for regulating the structure of dendritic spines. higher spine-density, a morphological defect observed in FXS, is reversed by genetic inhibition of P aK in Fmr1-KO mice (Figure 2). This is accompanied by a full recovery of normal LTP . at the behavioral level, reduced P aK activity attenuates abnormalities in locomotor activity, stereotypy, anxiety, and trace fear-conditioning. in another study, using Fmr1-KO mice with a 50% reduction in metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGlur5) expression, we find that elevated spine density is also reversed in the cortex and amygdala. Taken together, these findings have significant therapeutic implications for FXS and related autism spectrum disorders.Collaborators: Susumu Tonegawa and Mark Bear, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA and B.S. Shankaranarayana Rao, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore 7 A novel form of LTP induced by chemical activation of mGluRs in the amygdala Aparna Suvrathan, Ruchi Malik and Sonal KediaOur data on the reversal of enhanced spine density in Fmr1-KO mice by reducing mGlur5 expression is particularly significant in light of the \"mGlur theory\", which proposes that various aspects of FXS are a consequence of exaggerated mGlur function. Most findings that have contributed to the mGlur theory are based on studies in the hippocampus and cortex. however, the emotional or mood-related symptoms of FXS are likely to involve the amygdala, which remains unexplored in the context of the mGlur theory and FXS. intriguingly, two key symptoms of FXS - enhanced anxiety and spine-density - are also observed in the amygdala after stress. The stress response is also abnormally high in FXS individuals and Fmr1-KO mice. But, mGlur5-mediated plasticity in the hippocampus leads to weakening and elimination of synapses, not LTP and spine formation. This in turn would predict that if LTP is a necessary step for enhancing La spine-density and anxiety, then mGlur activation in the La should lead to synaptic strenghtening, not weakening. Confirming this prediction, brief bath application of a selective mGlur -agonist induces LTP in the La. in addition to its obvious implications for FXS, this novel form of LTP adds to growing evidence on contrasting forms of plasticity (a) in cortical pyramidal cells in Fmr1- KO mice, which can be reversed by genetic inhibition of P aK activity (b). SUM anT ra C ha TTarJ i NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 93 7/10/08 5:34:33 PMSelected publications The lab is in engaged in understanding the regulation of axonal transport of cargoes that are targeted to synapses. axonal transport carries a variety of cargoes from the cell body to the synapse and from the synapse to the cell body, known respectively as anterograde and retrograde transport. Transport along the axonal highway takes place using molecular motors that move on microtubule tracks by hydrolyzing aTP . Most kinesin family motors move to the plus-end of microtubules and thus carry cargo to the synapse while dynein motors carry cargo to the minus-end of microtubules and thus away from the synapse. Transport in neurons is an essential process. This has been demonstrated, for instance, by progressive motor neuropathies such as human CMT2A observed in patients carrying mutations in motor protein genes. neuronal transport is very complex and its regulation is poorly understood. To gain further insights, we study axonal transport of certain cargoes carried by Kinesin-3/UNC-104 and Kinesin-i/U nC-116, two well-characterized kinesin motor to transport synaptic vesicle proteins. Kinesin-i/U nC-116 is known to transport mitochondria and to influence transport of synaptic vesicle proteins. Presence of both these cargoes at synapses is very important for neuronal function. We visualize synaptic vesicles using synaptic vesicle proteins fused to GFP and mitochondria using a matrix targeted GFP . These markers report the localization of both synaptic vesicles and mitochondria not only at synapses but also along the axon. We broadly address the following questions: (1) Cargo recognition by the UnC-104 motor, (2) regulation of mitochondrial and synaptic vesicle transport by Kinesin-i and its cargo adaptors. We address these questions using a combination of genetic, live imaging and molecular techniques using the C. elegans model.Regulation of along the axon: the complex roles of J iPs in transport. BioEssays (in press). image of worm showing fluorescent mitochondria neurons Jitendra Kumar UnC-104 is a major synaptic vesicle motor in multiple model systems. This protein binds vesicles through its Ph-domain. The lipid binding Ph domain of U nC-104 has been shown to be essential for function. Further, an orthologous Ph-domain with the same in vitro lipid binding specificity does not fully restore U nC-104 function in vivo, suggesting a role for other proteins. We therefore began studying how the U nC-104 Ph domain recognizes cargo. We identified an unc-104 allele, (e1265) which has a single point mutation D1497N in the Ph domain that severely affects the locomotion of the mutant animals. To determine how a single amino acid change could dramatically alter function, we built a structural model of the U nC-104 Ph domain. On docking the reported substrate Pi P 2 onto this model, we observed that the highest probability of binding the lipid was in the region juxtaposed to D1497 (Figure 1). To further understand the role of this lesion we isolated intragenic suppressors of e1265 and sequenced the alleles obtained. We identified two intragenic suppressors within the Ph domain that restored locomotion to the e1265 allele. These intragenic suppressors have two compensatory changes in the Ph domain, namely either an M1540i lesion or an R1501Q lesion. The M1540i lesion was independently isolated multiple times. This residue acts at a distance of over 20\u00c5 and could mediate suppression effects through intermediate residues. The R1501Q is present in the same loop as D1497n and probably mediates its suppression effects locally. These suppressors also largely restore transport in the shorter motor neurons as seen by recovery of synaptic vesicle markers in synapses. however in D1497n M1540I or D1497n R1501Q alleles only restore transport. Live imaging of GFP::raB-3, a synaptic vesicle cargo marker, shows that anterograde flux in mechanosensory neurons is significantly reduced in unc-104(e1265) animals and is partially restored in the intragenic suppressor alleles (Figure 2). reports in literature suggest that cargo binding may influence the velocity profile of U nC-104. We are about to test whether the D1497n lesion and the other suppressor alleles affect the in vivo motility properties of the U nC-104 motor. in summary we have identified a new amino acid that we think influences U nC-104 Ph domain function by modulating its ability to bind cargo. We are also interested in other molecules that act along with U nC-104 to enable cargo recognition. That other proteins play roles in the ability of the Ph domain to bind cargo has been demonstrated by in vitro biochemistry showing reduced binding of the U nC-104 Ph domain to vesicles devoid of proteins. We have taken a genetic approach to identify such molecules by isolating extragenic suppressors of the e1265 allele. Characterization thus far has demonstrated that each such suppressor acts in neurons to partially restore transport. We are further characterizing these extragenic suppressors for allele-specificity by testing whether they restore locomotion to an unc-104 allele with a motor domain mutation or restore viability to an unc-104 null allele.

The Kinesin-i motor is a heteroteramer that consists of two heavy chains (KhC) and two light chains (KLC). The heavy chains bind microtubules and hydrolyze aTP while the light chains enable binding to certain cargoes. The role of Kinesin-i in synaptic vesicle transport requires a multi-protein adaptor complex found associated with the Kinesin-i motor (Figure 3). The main adaptor that links the Kinesin-i motor to its cargo is J iP3, a c-JU n kinase interacting protein. Members of the J iP family are J nK cascade kinase scaffolding proteins. They function as Kinesin-i cargo adapters and play complex roles in transport. For instance unc-16, the J iP3 orthologue in C. elegans, has been shown to function in an unc-104 bypass pathway. in unc-104; unc-16 double mutants certain synaptic vesicle proteins are able to exit the cell body and weakly suppress the locomotor defects of unc-104 mutants. it has been proposed that these effects are mediated by binding vesicular cargoes to alternate motors. Our current data suggest that in unc-16 mutants there is a significant reduction in the average anterograde velocity of GFP::raB-3 marked vesicles with only small effects on retrograde transport. The observed change in velocity profiles supports the hypothesis that certain synaptic vesicle proteins are transported by alternate motors only in the anterograde pathway. We are also assessing whether the unc-16 bypass pathway acts on all or a subset of synaptic vesicle proteins. We are also examining the role of other known members of the Kinesin-i adaptor complex (e.g. UNC-14) in the unc-104 bypass pathway. 3 Regulation of mitochondrial transport by Kinesin-I and its adaptor complex Guruprasad Reddy, Swathi Reddy and S. MohanThe Kinesin-i motor is known to transport mitochondria in other model systems. We tested whether the Kinesin-i motor and other associated molecules known to transport vesicular cargoes influence mitochondrial transport (Figure 3). as expected the lack of Kinesin-i motor greatly reduced the number of mitochondria in axons. Members of the complex such as unc-14 and unc-51 also reduced number of mitochondria in axons. Surprisingly, we found that lack of the vesicular adaptor UNC-16/ JiP3 dramatically increases the number of mitochondria (Figure 4). in unc-16, Kinesin-i motor double mutant animals the number of mitochondria in axons remains high. Thus we see that UNC-16/J iP3 has roles independent of the Kinesin-i motor in regulating numbers of mitochondria in axons (Figure 4). On live imaging of transport in unc-16 animals we observed a decrease in average retrograde velocity but no effect on anterograde velocity. Thus the effects of unc-16 on regulating mitochondrial numbers in axons may occur through retrograde transport in a Kinesin-i motor independent pathway. For at least one other member of the Kinesin-i adaptor complex we did not find such Kinesin-i motor independent roles. The unc-51 adaptor Kinesin-i motor double mutants did not show any change in mitochondrial numbers in axons when compared with Kinesin-i motor mutants alone. Some Kinesin-i motor independent effects of unc-16 could occur through J nK stress signaling pathways. Therefore we are testing the possible role of J nK cascade kinases in altering mitochondrial numbers in axons. Figure 3.

Serotonin (5-hT), a major neurotransmitter has been reported to affect early development in both invertebrates and vertebrates, though this is not much appreciated. We have spent the last few years trying to understand the role of a specific serotonin receptor subtype i.e. the 5-hT 2a receptor and its interaction with agonists, partial agonists and antagonists. in addition, we have been looking at serotonin and the role of this receptor in embryos and in stem cell populations. We have explored the interactions of dopamine, which acts as a partial agonist on the rat and human 5-hT2a receptors. The interactions of dopamine on the 5-hT2a receptor seem to be different from full agonists, such as serotonin, and antagonists, namely antipsychotics. We have identified conditions where dopamine activates the receptor at concentrations that are also known to be physiological. This adds another dimension both to our understanding of the role of this receptor as well as the role played by dopamine in psychiatric disorders. We have also extended our studies to look at the role of 5-hT and 5-hT 2a receptors in processes not often related directly to neural function and identified the presence of serotonin in pre- implantation mammalian embryos. Serotonin is distributed in a punctate manner within early embryos and is localized to the mitochondria. addition of 5-hT to embryos alters the mitochondrial potential which has an important role to play in embryonic development. Similarly, a lack of serotonin has been reported to effect mouse embryonic development. in our analysis of the receptor we observe functional 5-hT 2a receptors in embryonic stem cells as well as in neural stem cells. These receptors when blocked affect differentiation and seem to play a role in cell-substrate interactions, an aspect not previously studied. Our studies suggest newer roles for serotonin and its receptors and in areas previously unexplored.Bhattacharyya, S., Raote, I., Bhattacharya, A.

Serotoninergic and dopaminergic interactions are well known and are particularly important in the study of psychosis. antipsychotics and antidepressants largely target the receptors or the ligand of these two systems. The partial activation of the 5-hT 2a receptor by dopamine has been known for some time but the mechanism and its physiological relevance has not been understood. We have now established that though dopamine and serotonin activate the 5-hT 2a receptor the intracellular pathways associated with the activation are overlapping but different. in addition, we have identified conditions where these interactions would be physiologically relevant. We have discovered that if concentrations of serotonin sub-threshold for the internalization of the 5-hT 2a receptor are applied, the receptor becomes 10-fold more sensitive to dopamine. We have termed this 'priming' and this effect is maintained only transiently. The temporal order in which the ligands are applied is also critical and suggests a condition in which these two neurotransmitters may function like an anD gate. These results should help in understanding the role of these ligands and the 5-hT 2a receptor in behavior and also generate fresh clinical approaches in treating psychiatric disorders. More recently, in collaboration with Dr. Subeer Majumdar, nii, new Delhi, we have made transgenic mice that express the rat 5-hT 2a -EGFP receptor which will be used to study the receptor both in the brain as well as in other tissues.Collaborator: Sabeer Majumdar, National Institute of Immunology, Delhi 2 Examining the differences between human and rat 5-HT2A receptor subtypes Aditi Bhattacharya and Shobhana ShankarMost studies on the 5-hT 2a receptor have used the rat receptor as a model to study ligand interactions, drug binding as well as the second messenger pathways activated by the receptor. Our initial studies have also focused on the rat homolog. More recently, we have begun work on the human homolog and observed that there are subtle but perhaps critical differences in its interaction with agonists, partial agonists and antagonists. Since this may have important implications in clinical approaches we have examined the human homolog in greater detail. We have observed that the human receptor exhibits increased sensitivity to serotonin and also seems to have an increased repertoire of intracellular pathways. its sensitivity to dopamine is also higher. Site-specific mutagenesis studies have helped to identify key residues that are involved in these interactions. in addition, we have been working with a naturally occurring variant of this receptor that occurs with high frequency the human population. We have noticed that there are differences in the manner in which this variant receptor interacts with ligands and this could lead us to control receptor effects and activity better.Figure 1.

Time series of serotonin-mediated internalization of and Rupam Chowdhury Serotonin and its receptors have been known to play an important role in neural systems. its role in non-neural development and function outside the nervous system are not as widely appreciated. not surprisingly, the role of 5-hT 2a receptors in areas outside the nervous system has also not been extensively studied. We had in the last few years noticed that overexpression of the 5-hT2a receptor seems to affect cell-substrate adhesion in hEK 293 cells. The adhesion seems to be decreased by receptor-specific antagonists and adhesion is increased on application of serotonin. We have now determined that cytoskeletal changes that accompany changes in adhesion can be regulated by serotonin through the 5-hT 2a receptor and that the major second messenger pathway, which is associated with protein kinase C, does not play a role in the maintenance of adhesion. Similar roles seem to be played by the 5-hT 2a receptor in neural stem adhesion and embryonic stem cell differentiation in in vitro experiments. We have identified a number of genes that are downregulated on inhibiting the 5-hT2a receptor in in vitro studies. Extending these studies to in vivo models, we find that the same genes are downregulated in the brain on exposure to an antagonist of the receptor. These studies indicate that antagonists to the 5-hT 2a receptor may bring about changes in a new and unexpected manner and changes in the adhesion properties may play a part in the changes brought about by such ligands.Collaborator: Sanjeev Galande, National Centre for Cell Science, Pune 4 Characterization and differentiation of cells serve both as valuable models systems for developmental biology as well as substrates for cell replacement therapies. We have been looking at the differentiation of embryonic stem cells towards neural lineages. a report on the presence of serotonin, a neurotransmitter in mouse embryonic stem cells, led us to look for serotonin in human embryonic stem cells and also its receptors. We find that serotonin is present and distributed in a punctate pattern in both human and embryonic stem cells and both isoforms of tryptophan hydroxylase are present, indicating that serotonin is synthesized in ES cells. in addition, we find that a few of the serotonin receptor subtypes are also expressed in mammalian ES cells. We have established that one of the receptor subtypes, i.e. 5-hT 2a, is functional and blocking this receptor affects the differentiation of ES cells. We are presently exploring the mechanism by which serotonin and its receptors affect ES cell growth and differentiation. 5 Role of serotonin in pre-implantation embryos Basudha BasuThe presence of serotonin in mammalian ES cells led us to look for its presence in earlier stages in development, namely pre-implantation embryos. Pre-implantation mouse embryos were examined at various stages for serotonin using immunocytochemistry as well as multi-photon microscopy. The latter technique allows us to visualize 5-hT in live embryos. We find that serotonin is present in early embryos including oocytes and that it is distributed in punctate structures. in pre-implantation embryos, both TPh2, the neural isoform of tryptophan hydroxylase and the serotonin transporter are present. in addition, we find that serotonin is localized to mitochondria in embryos and can increase mitochondrial potential. Lack of serotonin and changes in mitochondrial potential have both been known to disrupt embryonic development. We are now determining the mechanism by which serotonin affects mitochondrial potential.Collaborators: Sudipta NCBS Figure 3.
