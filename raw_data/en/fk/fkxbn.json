At the age of ten(1928) in Detroit, he constructed his first radio and spentthe rest of his life developing and innovating in all fieldsof electronics. Through early experimentations, he verified that there were personal and health benefits from electricity, energy,light and sound. One such experiment, he transmittedradio signals underground.Through complex experiments hewas able to make the grass growabundantly. Through continuedexperiments he communicatedthrough a variety of soils andplanted a variety of vegetation andfound they all grew higher andfaster than usual. Ed Skilling continued to pursue his keen interest in all things electronicand was trained as an electricalengineer, as a result of his passionfor electronics and engineering helater included the fields ofmechanical and hydraulicengineering. Ed consistentlyinvented and innovated with unique capability. Hisreputation as inventor and innovator led to industrialengineering and electronic engineering positions. Histalents and skills shined in the Aerospace industry from1950 to 1983. His vast experience prepared him for theadvanced position with General Dynamics as their SeniorElectronics Engineer, which he held for 17 years. He later was advanced to a position as Section Head of the first guided missile plant in the United States. Ed'sability to solve aerospace and industrial problems byinventing and innovating, attracted many other prominentcompanies to enlist his services. In 1959, Ed was commissioned by a group of California Cancer Doctors to evaluate an original Rife Instrumentthey purchased for $30,000. Rife had believed thatcertain frequencies would \"kill or blow up pathogens\" bytuning in their resonance frequencies. Later Rife and someof his loyalists, started to compile lists of frequencies tocorrespond to illnesses and symptoms. Rife noticed thatcertain frequencies were starting to appear on differentlists. He later concluded that these frequencies were not\"killing\" or \"blowing up\" any pathogens but, wereprobably boosting the ability of the body to do the jobitself. Much later he called them, \"universal healingfrequencies.\" Ed Skilling, with his genius andvast experience, recognized therewas more to it than simplytransmitting a \"number on a meter\"(frequency) toward the body. Heunderstood and proved there wasmuch more to it than simplefrequencies. He took a more \"bodyfriendly\" direction to communicatein harmony with the impedance(resistance) of the body toharmonize with cells, tissue,organs and systems of the body.He found that our immune systemand regeneration system used thisunique harmonic energy toimprove its functions and conditions. Ed took the long history of frequencytechnology in a more \"result oriented\" direction thananyone before him. The death of Ed Skilling's daughter from cancer in 1983 and previous instances of cancer deaths in his familyspurred Ed's interest and solidified his commitment toadvance the use of electronic technologies for health andhumanity. The United States Psychotronics Foundationawarded Ed Skilling the \"Lifetime Achievement Award.\"He is the only person that has received \"two\" LifetimeAchievement Awards. The Photon Genie and the PhotonGenius are his latest and greatest crowning achievements. Ed Skilling understood that electro-magnetic harmonic frequencies, in effect, communicate and resonate withcells, tissue, organs and systems of the body. This allows www.edskilling.com 1Section 1: Energy and the Human Body \"The only known \"cure\" for anything is your own God-given Immune System. All I did is figure out how to communicate with it and power it up.\" Ed SkillingED SKILLING AND THE SKILLING INSTITUTESECTION 1: ENERGY AND THE HUMAN BODYthe immune system to gradually gain strength, thus empowering the body to balance, heal and regeneratenaturally. Skilling would often say, \"The only known \"cure\" for anything is your own God-given Immune System. All I did is figure out how to communicate with it and power it up.\" In the year 2000, after nearly 40 years of research and development, Ed Skilling released his greatestbreakthrough technology incorporating a regenerationcircuitry which he released as the Photon Genie. ThePhoton Genie is the first instrument that Ed developed tospecifically prevent the body from acclimating (adjustingto, and becoming \"used to\", or insensitive to).Additionally, he incorporated all his innovativediscoveries of his other instruments like ControlledFrequency Harmonics, Pulse Control and all the primaryfeatures of his Photon Maxima, i.e., the combination ofMultiwave Oscillator, Frequency Broadcast, LymphaticDrainage, Oxygenation, Photo-Bioelectric, Noble GasTube Technology and Subtle Energy Transmission, all intoone powerful and easy-to-use portable instrument. Thisadded the benefits of bio-electrical and frequencynourishment, detoxification, rejuvenation, andregeneration all at the same time on both the subtle andphysical levels. The Photon Genie provides multipledynamics using multiple transmitters combined with hisuniquely powerful Noble Gas Tube Technologiesproviding the greatest bio-available electro-magneticenergy instrument ever created at that time. In fact, virtually all electro-medical instruments created since 1980 are either designed by Ed Skilling or basedon designs from Ed Skilling. Ed was the only inventorsince the 1950's that not only understood and built onthe work of the electro-medical giants of the past, i.e.,Tesla, Abrams, Rife, Lakhovsky, etc., but far surpassedtheir efforts. It's simply not enough to laud the heroes fromthe past, Ed Skilling took the field of electro-medicine intothe 21st Century almost single-handedly, and should beappreciated for the genius he is and the GeniusInstruments he developed.Ed Skilling and his Skilling Institute recently developed andreleased, in December of 2009, the Photon Genius. ThePhoton Genius was first featured at the World Congress ofAnti-Aging in 2009. Skilling's Photon Genius Instrument isamplified and the first Energy Sauna in history. Heincorporated all the innovative and \"result oriented\"technologies of the Photon Genie. The addition of Thermo-therapy, Far Infrared Technology and Sauna Therapy tothe benefits of the Photon Genie provide a new technologythat is years ahead of any electro-medical device in theworld. The benefits of this new Energy Infrared Technologyalone is significant because infrared is known to indirectlyproduce nitric oxide in the body. Nitric oxide, the so-called\"miracle molecule\" may well be the most significantmedical advance of the past twenty years. Ed Skilling is the most prolific inventor in the 100 plus year history of electro-medicine. Ed has always beenknown as a man with a gentle spirit and a man of unusualintegrity who never developed technologies for personalcredit or personal profit, but instead chose to devote histime to electronic inventions and innovations to relieve thesuffering of people. His calm unassuming manner andactual humility contributed to the beneficial results hisinstruments always achieved. His personal character andhumble devotion to results for others is probably why heis not better known outside the electro-medicine andalternative medical therapy fields, despite his historic,incredible genius. 2www.edskilling.comSECTION 1: ENERGY AND THE HUMAN BODYThe key understanding is that it is the human body itself that produces the great life restoring energy and chemistryfor good health and the Photon Genius dynamicallytriggers this chemical and energetic balancing effect topromote your body being the best it can be. The Skilling Institute's Photon Genius combines the healing power of Noble Gases (Krypton, Xenon, Neon, Argon,Helium in a proprietary combination) transmitted inconcert with Energy Infrared waves. The Photon Genius\"targets\" the whole body and/or any of its parts withEnergy Infrared waves. This is the first instrument to\"target\" the body and its parts withHarmonic Energy Infrared to facilitate thebody's ability to \"balance\" and detoxifywhile improving the body's ability to heal. The Photon Genius stands about six feet tall in a horseshoe shape. Sitting or standingin front of it, you notice the color therapywith the Noble Gas tubes pulsating andtransmitting energy from the Noble Gasglass tubes of various colors and the EnergyInfrared heat being transmitted. The PhotonGenius transmits Skilling proprietaryHarmonic Energy through the Noble Gasesvacuum sealed in the colorful glass tubesputting the gasses into a semi-plasma state.Due to the different molecular weight ofeach Inert Gas, the proprietary SkillingEnergy transmitted through this uniquecombination of Noble Gases generatesbillions of Harmonics that resonate with theenergies of the human body. The Photon Genius nourishes the body with a complete spectrum of bio-availableharmonic frequencies to break upblockages and barrier tissues in the body,while moving the lymphatic and circulatorysystems to assist in detoxification. Nourishment and\"balance\" is the driving principal behind this innovativeapproach to healing. Nourishing the body's powerful self-healing ability has much deeper and longer-lastingbenefits than allopathically forcing a change of symptomswith chemicals\" (Dr. Martha Grout). Symptoms are simplythe body communicating to us about much deeper levelsof physiological and energetic imbalances. The EnergyInfrared heat is used to elevate the body temperature inmuch the same way the body triggers a fever to killbacteria, germs, viruses and pathogens. www.edskilling.com 3INTRODUCTION TO THE PHOTON GENIUS SECTION 1: ENERGY AND THE HUMAN BODYThe National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), formerly the Office of AlternativeMedicine (OAM), a United States government agency(one of 27 National Institute of Health subsidiaries)dedicated to exploring complementary and alternativemedicine (CAM) healing practices in the context ofrigorous science, in training complementary andalternative medicine researchers, and in disseminatingauthoritative information to the public and professionals,denotes the following forms of medical systems: \u0081 Whole medical systems such as homeopathy, naturopathy, traditional Chinese medicine, andayurveda. \u0081 Mind-body takes a holistic approach to health that explores the interconnection between themind, body, and spirit. It works under the premisethat the mind can influence bodily functions andconditions and symptoms. \u0081 Biologically based practices such as dietary supplements, herbal supplements, and othertherapies such as shark cartilage. \u0081 Manipulative and Body-Based Practices such as spinal manipulation (both chiropractic andosteopathic) and massage. \u0081 Energy therapies such as qigong, reiki, therapeutic touch, and electromagnetic therapydivided into two camps: o Biofield therapies are intended to influence putative (non-measurable) energy fields that surround and penetrate the body. o Bioelectromagnetic-based therapies use veritable (verifiable and measurable)electromagnetic fields, such as pulsed fields,alternating-current, direct-current fields, bio-photonic energy in an unconventional manner.Usage of Complementary Medicine andIntegrative Medicine Many people utilize mainstream medicine for diagnosis and basic information, while turning to alternatives fortherapy or health-enhancing measures. Studies indicatethat alternative approaches are often used in conjunctionwith conventional medicine. This is referred to byNCCAM as integrative (or integrated) medicine becauseit \"combines treatments from conventional medicine andCAM for which there is some high-quality evidence ofsafety and effectiveness.\" According to Andrew T. WeilM.D., a leading proponent of integrative medicine. Theprinciples of integrative medicine include: appropriateuse of conventional and CAM methods; patientparticipation; promotion of health as well as treatment ofdisease; and a preference for natural, minimally-invasivemethods. A 1997 survey found that 13.7% of respondents in the United States had sought the services of both a medicaldoctor and an alternative medicine practitioner. The samesurvey found that 96% of respondents who sought theservices of an alternative medicine practitioner alsosought the services of a medical doctor in the past 12months. Medical doctors are often unaware of theirpatient's use of alternative medical treatments as only38.5% of the patients using alternative therapiesdiscussed it with their medical doctor. Edward Ernst, Professor of Complementary Medicine at the University of Exeter, wrote in the Medical Journal ofAustralia that \"about half the general population indeveloped countries use complementary and alternativemedicine (CAM).\" Survey results released in May 2004by NCAAM found that in 2002, 62.1% of adults in thecountry had used some form of CAM in the past 12months and 75% across their lifespan. This study includedyoga, meditation, herbal treatments and the Atkins diet asCAM. Another study suggests a similar figure of 40%. The use of alternative medicine in developed countries appears to be increasing. A 1998 study showed that the 4www.edskilling.comCOMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINESECTION 1: ENERGY AND THE HUMAN BODYuse of alternative medicine had risen from 33.8% in 1990 to 42.1% in 1997. In the United Kingdom, a 2000 reportordered by the House of Lords suggested that \"...limiteddata seem to support the idea that CAM use in the UnitedKingdom is high and is increasing.\" In developingnations, access to essential medicines is severely restrictedby lack of resources and poverty. Traditional remedies,often closely resembling or forming the basis foralternative remedies, may comprise primary healthcare,or be integrated into the healthcare system. In Africa,traditional medicine is used for 80% of primaryhealthcare, and in developing nations as a whole, overone-third of the population lack access to essentialmedicines. Advocates of alternative medicine hold that the various alternativetreatment methods are effective intreating a wide range of major andminor medical conditions, and thatrecently published research (such asMichalsen, 2003, Gonsalkorale2003, and Berga 2003) proves theeffectiveness of specific alternativetreatments. They assert that aPubMed search revealed over370,000 research papers classifiedas alternative medicine werepublished in Medicine-recognizedjournals since 1966 in the NationalLibrary of Medicine database. Seealso Kleijnen 1991, and Linde 1997. Complementary therapies are often used in palliative care, or by practitioners attempting to manage chronic pain inpatients. Complementary medicine is considered moreacceptable in the interdisciplinary approach used inpalliative care than in other areas of medicine. \"From itsearly experiences of care for the dying, palliative care tookfor granted the necessity of placing patient values and\"quality of life\" at the core of any design and delivery ofcare at the end of life. If the patient desired complementarytherapies, and as long as such treatments providedadditional support and did not endanger the patient, theywere considered acceptable.\" The non-drug interventions of complementary medicine can employ mind-bodyinterventions designed to \"reduce pain and concomitantmood disturbance, and increase quality of life.\" Physicians who practice complementary medicine usually discuss and advise patients as to available complementary therapies. Patients often expressinterest in mind-body complementarytherapies because they offer a non-drug approach to treating somehealth conditions. Some mind-bodytechniques, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, were onceconsidered complementary medicine,but are now embraced as a part ofconventional medicine in the UnitedStates. \"Complementary medicine treatments used for pain include: acupuncture,low-level laser therapy, meditation,aroma therapy, Chinese medicine,dance therapy, music therapy,massage, herbalism, therapeutic touch, yoga, osteopathy, chiropractic, naturopathy, andhomeopathy.\" Interestingly enough, electromagnetic andelectro-medicine are now routinely used in allopathic medicinefor bone regeneration and pain management, among others,while still considered a \"complementary treatment.\" www.edskilling.com 5\"About half the general population in developed countries use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).\" Edward ErnstSECTION 1: ENERGY AND THE HUMAN BODYElectromagnetic waves can be used for diagnostic purposes because living organisms are energy-based.Historically, most cultures have erroneously regarded thebody solely as a mechanical and biochemical organism.Every cell in the body is a transmitter and receiver ofelectromagnetic information. The following are examples of how human beings, animals, and plants contain and respond to electro-magnetic fields: \u0081 During migration, monarch butterflies, locusts, and even blindfolded birds navigate flawlessly.Salamanders and turtles also use magnetic fieldsto navigate. We now know that magnetite, ahighly magnetic mineral, is found in the tissueand brains of insects, birds, reptiles, andamphibians. \u0081 Bacteria use their magnetic sense to burrow deeper into the mud. We now know thatmagnetite is also present in bacteria andprotozoa. \u0081 Many kinds of fish are able to follow each other in organized formations (\"schools\") due to themagnetic fields generated by the magnetite intheir bodies. \u0081 The whiskers of dogs, cats, and other animals are now recognized to function as antennas, dueto their sensitivity to electromagnetic fields. \u0081 In plants, the sharp points of leaves, as well as pine needles and the blades of some species ofgrass, act like antennas for electrical signals. \u0081 Melatonin, a hormone that (among other functions) helps induce sleep, is produced by thepineal gland only in darkness. We now knowthat the pineal gland, deep inside the brain inthe skull, is exquisitely sensitive to light. \u0081 Stingrays find food because they can detect normal, minute amounts of electrical dischargeor magnetic fields emanating from their prey.\u0081 Fish, dolphins, and whales use both the Earth's magnetic fields and sonar (sound) for navigationand communication. \u0081 The behavior of some animals has long been used to forecast earthquakes. Cattle stampede,birds sing at the wrong time of day, mother catsmove their kittens, snakes seek shelter. B. BlakeLevitt writes: \"It is now thought that [the animals]are reacting to changes in the Earth's magneticfield, as well as to electrostatic charges in the air\u2014 long before the quake actually occurs orregisters on even the most sensitive instruments.\" In his article \"The Electrical Properties of Cancer Cells,\"medical doctor Steve Haltiwanger describes how thebody partly functions as a living electrical circuit. Variouscells and tissues are conductors (allow for electron flow),insulators (inhibit electron flow), semiconductors (allowfor electron flow in only one direction), capacitors(accumulate and store a charge, later to release thatcharge), and so on. Cells transmit and receive energy,and each has its very own frequency with which itoscillates. Magnetic fields applied to the body create biological changes, as do electrical fields (which are related tomagnetic fields.) We now know that in humans, thesinuses, some other bones in the face, and various tissuesin the body contain magnetite. Not only is every cell in the body a transmitter and receiver of electromagnetic information, it is these variouselectromagnetic frequencies that precede and correspondto biochemical functions. For example, healthy cellsoscillate at higher frequencies than do unhealthy cellssuch as cancer cells. The lower frequency of cancer isreflected by (and causes) the aberrant biochemicalreactions within the cell. Put another way, the biochemicaldifferences between normal healthy cells and cancer cellscorrespond to the differences in the electrical propertiesof each. The same holds true for magnetic fields.Magnetic fields correspond to biological activity. Achange in the magnetic field means a change in the cells,either beneficial or harmful. 6www.edskilling.comENERGY IN LIVING SYSTEMSSECTION 1: ENERGY AND THE HUMAN BODYHealing Effects of Electromagnetic Radiation and Fields Considering the extent of artificially created, non- beneficial electro-magnetic radiation that surrounds us,it's not surprising that (aside from the contributing factorsof poor diet, toxins, pathogens, and chemical pollutants)so many people are ill and the rest just don't feel good alot of the time. The good news is that if frequencies canharm, they can also be managed and controlled topromote healing. Cells have the ability to positively and healthfully respond to minuteelectromagnetic stimulus\u2014as longas certain criteria are met. Thestimulus must be from the correctregion of the electro-magneticspectrum. It must be further refined(if necessary) to an exact frequency,or combination of frequencies onthat electro-magnetic band. It mustbe the correct intensity, and wherepossible, transmitted in harmonywith the natural impedance(resistance) of the body. It must havethe correct shape wave, or wavepacket. It must be administered in the correct amountsand durations. And it must be accurately and preciselyfocused at the target. In electronics, the term inductive coupling refers to the transfer of energy from one component to another througha shared magnetic field. In electro-medicine (EM), theresponse of living cells to beneficial EM radiation is alsoknown as inductive coupling. Once the EM fields insidea cell are exposed to EM radiation, the fields within thecell start to move. Along with this energetic process, thecorresponding biochemical responses are activated, suchas the movement of electrolytes through the cellmembrane, excretion of wastes, and so on. Inductivecoupling is being utilized in a growing number ofextremely effective electro-medical instruments.Researchers are discovering that many of the beneficial effectsfrom electro-medical instruments come from pulsed magneticfields (which, by definition, become electromagneticradiation.) Pulsing a magnetic field does more than inducemovement in the body receiving the signal. Because pulsing,by definition, means that there is an \"off\" period to the signal,it ensures that the human or animal receiving the signal doesnot become acclimated, or resistant to its effects. A goodanalogy is someone tapping your arm. At first you payattention; but after awhile, the body becomes impervious tothe sensation so it can focus on other stimuli. This is just oneof the many secrets of Ed Skilling's electro-medicine instruments that are effective. Correctlyemployed, frequency therapies canincrease cell energy, normalizemembrane conductivity, lessenoxidative stress, reduce the synthesis,boost naturalimpedance. The restoration of thesemetabolic processes lead to theregeneration of tissue as well asincreased resistance to disease. \"Bigger is better\" and \"More is better\" figure prominentlyin the Western mindset. The unbridled use of massivedoses of many different kinds of drugs and the routinepractice of \"prophylactic\" invasive surgeries illustrate thismentality. Another, more humane edict \u2014 \"Less is more\"\u2014 reflects what the body usually needs. The exquisitesensitivity of cells to electromagnetic fields of all kindsexplains why electro-medical instruments work. Low powerenergies might not be easily perceived subjectively, butthey are the most compatible with living systems. Electro-medicine therapies may use many portions of the EM spectrum: electrical current, magnetism, visible light,far infrared (FIR), ultraviolet (UV), and heat (in the form ofspecific, FIR wavelengths.) www.edskilling.com 7HEALING EFFECTS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION AND FIELDS The exquisite sensitivity of cells to electromagnetic fields of all kinds explains why electro-medical instruments work.SECTION 1: ENERGY AND THE HUMAN BODYVeritable Cellular Energy As shown previously, the body's cells are electric. Researchers at Harvard University say that when anembryo is only 4 cells in size, an electrical gradient startsswitching on the genes that allow the developing embryoto distinguish right from left. Essentially, every cell in the body is a miniature battery. Normally the outside of the cell has a positive electricalcharge and the inside has a negative charge. But thesecharges may momentarily be reversed based on theaction of \"ion pumps\" on the cell membrane that drivesodium ions out of the cell andpump potassium ions into the cell(an ion is an atom or group ofatoms that carries an electricalcharge.) This movement of electrically charged ions at the cellular level isthe basic building block in thecomplex electromagnetic workingsof your \"body electric.\" And whilethis current may be basic, it is NOTsmall in relation to its size. Thesmallest voltmeters created byUniversity of Michigan biophysicalchemist Raoul Koppelman in 2008can fit thousands of voltmetersinside a single human cell and stilltake up only one-millionth of thecell's volume. Interestingly enough,the charge measured by the new tiny voltmeters is inexcess of 15 million volts per meter throughout. This isabout the strength of lightning, and now proves that thecell is NOT 99.9% electrically dormant, but full ofelectrical and chemical energy throughout and not just inthe cellular membrane as previously thought. Creation of Cellular Electrical EnergyElectricity is a fundamental entity of nature consisting of negative and positive particles exhibiting attractions andrepulsions. These attractions and repulsions manifestthemselves as movements of these charged particles, or inother words -- electrical current. This form of energy playsa critical role in the proper function of our body. The key players in creating the electric energy within our body are structures called ions. An ion is an atom orgroup of atoms carrying an electric charge by virtue ofhaving gained or lost one or more valence electrons.Valence electrons are those electrons in the outer ring ofelectrons orbiting the nucleus of the atom. Ions may existin solid, liquid, or gaseous environments, although thosein liquid are more common and familiar. Most ionic compounds fall in the category ofchemicals called salts. Ions existing in a liquid state are electrolytes. An electrolyte is anycompound that, in solution, conductselectricity and is decomposed orelectrolyzed by the electricity. Thisform of compound is ionizable insolution. Electrolytes, or in other words compounds that are ionizable insolution, play an essential role inmany body functions. Cells createelectrical energy as ions move fromthe solutions inside the cells of ourbody to the solutions outside thecells. This form of energy is a staplein the normal function of human body systems. For example, the nervous system useselectrical energy, termed nerve impulses, to transmitmessages from one cell in the body to another cell in thebody. This manifests as muscle movement, glandularsecretion, excretion, temperature regulation, and evenmental thought. In the body, fluids both inside and outside the cells are electrolyte solutions. This means they are watersuspensions of ions. The electrolyte solutions both insideand outside the cells contain equal amounts of positive 8www.edskilling.comEssentially, every cell in the body is a miniature battery. Normally the outside of the cell has a positive electrical charge and the inside has a negative charge.SECTION 1: ENERGY AND THE HUMAN BODY(cations) and negative (anions) ions making the body as a whole electrically neutral. The limiting boundary of thecell, the cell membrane, separates these ionic solutions. Generally, a very small excess of anions accumulatesimmediately inside the cell membrane along its innersurface, and an equal number of cations accumulatesimmediately outside the cell membrane. This is the restingstate of the cell. This difference in ion concentration onthe adjacent surfaces of the cell membrane creates anelectrical energy potential, or electrochemical gradient.This is very similar to a battery where one end has alarger concentration of positively charged particles andthe other end a greater concentration of negativelycharged particles. Completing the circuit by connectingthe ends of the battery, allows charged particles to movebetween the two ends creating energy as an electricalcurrent. A similar energy source arises in the body ascharged ions move across the cell membrane. In our bodies, the nervous and muscular systems use the electrolyte properties of ionic sodium and potassium,assisted by lesser trace elements ( e.g. copper) togenerate currents across the membranes of their cells. Thiscurrent, or movement of charged particles, results fromthe electrochemical gradient set up across the cellmembrane. The electrochemical gradient sets up the twotypes of movement that produce the current. The chemicalgradient results in the passive movement of ions from aregion of higher concentration to a region of lowerconcentration. The electrical gradient creates a movementof ions of one charge to an area of ions of the oppositecharge. The result of this current is the transmission ofnerve impulses and the contraction of muscle tissue.The ionic particles of the nervous impulse can bevisualized in the following simplified process. Neurons,the conducting cells of the nervous system, communicateby generating and propagating action potentials. Anaction potential is an abrupt pulse-like change in thepositive-negative charge differential on either side of thenerve cell membrane. This results in a change of theresting potential of the cell. This can be caused by anyfactor that suddenly increases the permeability of the cellmembrane for positively charged sodium ions. Thismovement of ions results in a flow of charged particlesinto and out of the cell, creating an electrical current. Thereplication of this process to adjacent areas of the cellmembrane forms the electrical message, or nervousimpulse, that moves along the nerve cell toward anothercell in the body. This propagated action potential thenbecomes the energy source that initiates body functionsranging from muscle contraction to creative thought. Ions, as we can see, play an important role in the body. Calcium, potassium, sodium, chloride, and copper ions aresome key ions that participate in the body's electrical events.Potassium is the major positive ion inside the cell. Sodium isthe major positive ion found in the fluid outside the cell. Ionicchlorine is the most abundant negative ion. Imbalances ofany of these ions, or certain trace ions in the body, orinhibition of sodium ion transport across the cell membranescan lead to dysfunction in the conduction of electricalmessages. This dysfunction quickly leads to a general bodydisturbance and loss of ability to maintain somewhat stableinternal conditions. The body requires \"balance\" formaximum health and it starts in the body's cells. www.edskilling.com 9SECTION 1: ENERGY AND THE HUMAN BODYNot only are the body's cells generating electricity and a corresponding electromagnetic field, both of which cannow be measured, but the cells also emit visible light. Theexistence of this endogenous light was discovered in the1920's by the Russian embryologist Alexander Gurwitschand has been conclusively demonstrated by modernbiophysicists since the late 1960's with state-of-the-arttechnology and new research methods. All living organisms, including humans, emit a low- intensity glow that cannot be seen by the naked eye, butcan be measured by photo-multipliers that amplify theweak signals several million times and enable theresearchers to register it in the form of a diagram. As longas they live, cells and whole organisms give off apulsating glow with a mean intensity of several photons,up to a few ten thousand photons, per second. This corresponds to a candle-light seen from 15 miles distance and is tens to hundreds of millions times weakerthan daylight. This glow can also be made visible bymeans of a CCD camera whose input of differences inbrightness is then transformed by a computer into colorsdisplayed on a video screen. Because of its low intensity, this cellular glow, also known as biophoton emission, is often referred to as ultra-weakcell radiation, or ultra-weak bioluminescence. Its spectralrange of frequencies (colors) extends from 200 - 800nanometers, i.e., from UV-C and UV-A through the wholevisible range into the infrared part of the spectrum. It should not be confounded with the \"bioluminescence\" of fire-flies, glow-worms, deep sea fishes, and rottingwood which is much stronger, has different properties,and is clearly of chemical origin. In the 1960's the first reports by Russian scientists about \"ultra-weak cell radiation\", as mitogenetic radiation isnow called, were published in Western languages. WhileRussian scientists had done extensive investigations withphoto-multipliers since the late 1940's, systematicWestern research in this field only started with theexperiments of the Australian physical chemist Terence I.Quickenden in the late 1960's and early 1970's, andfinally with the work of the German biophysicist FritzAlbert Popp from 1974 onwards. Popp and his collaborators at the University of Marburg, and later at the University of Kaiserslautern and theInternational Institute of Biophysics at Kaiserslautern andNeuss, were the first to carry out systematic experimentaland theoretical investigations of all questions related tothis new biological phenomenon. Since then, Popp and his colleagues, and many other researchers all over the world, have not onlydemonstrated the existence and ubiquity of biophotonemission beyond any reasonable doubt, but also haveestablished its properties, have developed and tested anumber of hypotheses about its possible biologicalfunctions, for which much evidence has now been found,have done a lot of theoretical work towards a biophotontheory explaining all or some of the phenomenaobserved, and have started to develop a number ofpractical applications for the use of biophotonmeasurements of microorganisms, plants, animals, andhumans. Today, the International Institute of Biophysics (IIB) founded by Popp and some of his colleagues in 1996has become an international research network comprising22 members of 14 research groups at universities in theUSA, China, Russia, Poland, India, Japan, Korea, Israel,Italy, England, and Germany. Altogether, there are about 40 research groups worldwide working in biophoton research. Source: University of Utah 10 www.edskilling.comOUR CELLS PRODUCE LIGHTSECTION 1: ENERGY AND THE HUMAN BODYBiophotons consist of light with a high degree of order, in other words, biological laser light. Such a light is veryquiet and shows an extremely stable intensity, without thefluctuations normally observed in light. Because of theirstable field strength, its waves can superimpose, and byvirtue of this, interference effects become possible that donot occur in ordinary light. Because of the high degree oforder, the biological laser light is able to generate andkeep order and transmit information in the organism. In biophoton research, the property of coherence mainly shows in the \"hyperbolic decay\" of so-called \"inducedemission.\" Two types of measurement are used inbiophoton research. In the spontaneous emission of asample it is practically impossible to provide evidence ofcoherence. For this reason, the measurement of \"inducedemission\" has become an important instrument ofbiophoton research, where it is possible to determine thedegree of coherence of the light emitted by the organism.Here, the sample is illuminated by a short flash of lightbefore the researcher measures in which way theabsorbed light is given off again. In doing so, he canobserve that biophoton emission from living tissue showsa very extended decaying process lasting for a period ofminutes to hours, something which is never observed indead objects. Furthermore, this decay continuously slows down, such that the decay curve becomes flatter all the time and theemission never really ceases. Popp has given proof thatsuch a decaying behavior, which graphically is displayedin the form of a hyperbolic curve, is evidence of thecoherence of the measured emission and indicates thatlight is stored in the tissue. Another conclusion that can be drawn from this behavior of the re-emitted biophotons is that the emission is notoriginating from isolated molecules in the cells, but thatthe emitting molecules are coupled by a connectingcoherent radiation field. A central role in the light storageseems to be attributable to the DNA in the cell nucleuswhich Popp's group has shown to be the main light sourcein the cell. Source: International Light AssociationBioPhotons and a New Picture of the HumanBody The experimental findings of biophoton research, together with recent insights from other fields of advanced science,are suggesting an entirely new picture of the livingorganism. First of all, as a complement to the solid bodyof molecules, we have an important new component oraspect of the organism to consider. Namely, the\"electromagnetic field body\" (Zhang, 2003). From thispoint of view, the living organism appears as a highlycomplex and self-tunable resonating system of oscillatingfields that are coupled nonlinearly by their phase relations(Bischof, 2003.) If we consider the role of the molecules, the organism can be defined as a extremely sensitive and highly effectiveantennae system, able to tune itself according to need toa broad range of frequencies and polarizations. Theorganism is able to react sensitively to the smallest stimuli,but at the same time can also abruptly becometransparent for quite strong stimuli. Not only is the human body electric and electromagnetic, but biophotonic, as well. This massive increase in ourknowledge about veritable energy in the body has nowshown to be able to produce cellular intelligence,communication, transmission and even consciousness. Photons (Light) Control Everything in the Cell Photons switch on the body's processes like an orchestra conductor bringing each individual instrument into thecollective sound. At different frequencies, they performdifferent functions. Popp found that molecules in the cellsresponded to certain frequencies, and that a range ofvibrations from the photons caused a variety offrequencies in other molecules of the body. This theory has been supported by Dr. Veljko Veljkovic who now heads the Center for Multidisciplinary Researchand Engineering, Institute of Nuclear Sciences Vinca. Shedared to ask the question that has forever puzzled cellularbiologists: What is it that enabled the tens of thousandsof different kinds of molecules in the organism to www.edskilling.com 11THE COHERENCE OF BIOPHOTONSSECTION 1: ENERGY AND THE HUMAN BODYrecognize their specific targets? Living processes depend on selective interactions between particular molecules,and that is true for basic metabolism to the subtlestnuances of emotion. It's like trying to find a friend in avery big, very crowded ballroom in the dark. The conventional picture of a cell even now is that of a bag of molecules dissolved in water. And through bumpinginto one another by chance -- random collisions -- thosemolecules that have complementary shapes lock onto toeach other so the appropriate biochemical reactions cantake place. This 'lock and key'model has been refined to a moreflexible (and realistic) 'induced fit'hypothesis that allows eachmolecule to change shape slightlyto fit the other better after they get intouch, but the main idea remainsthe same. It is supposed to explain how enzymes can recognize theirrespective substrates, howantibodies in the immune systemcan grab onto specific foreigninvaders and disarm them. Byextension, that's how proteins can'dock' with different partnerproteins, or latch onto specificnucleic acids to control gene expression, or assemble intoribosomes for translating proteins, or other multi-molecularcomplexes that modify the genetic messages in variousways. But, with thousands -- or even hundreds of thousandsof reactions happening each second in just one cell, thisseems pushing the \"mechanical\" concept a bit too far.What has been proposed is that somehow each moleculesends out a unique electromagnetic field that can \"sense\"the field of the complementary molecule. It's as if there isa \"dance\" in the cellular medium and the molecules moveto the rhythm. The music is supplied by the biophoton. \"Veljkovic and Cosic proposed that molecular interactions are electrical in nature, and they take place overdistances that are large compared with the size ofmolecules. Cosic later introduced the idea of dynamicelectromagnetic field interactions, that moleculesrecognize their particular targets and vice versa byelectromagnetic resonance. In other words, the moleculessend out specific frequencies of electromagnetic waveswhich not only enable them to 'see' and 'hear' each other, as both photon and phonon modes exist forelectromagnetic waves, but also to influence each otherat a distance and become ineluctably drawn to eachother if vibrating out of phase (in a complementary way.)\" - The Real Bioinformatics \"There are about 100,000chemical reactions happening inevery cell each second. Thechemical reaction can only happenif the molecule that is reacting isexcited by a photon. Once thephoton has excited a reaction itreturns to the field and is availablefor more reactions... We areswimming in an ocean of light.\" These 'biophoton emission', as Popp called them, provided anideal communication system for thetransfer of information to many cellsacross the organism. But, the singlemost important question remained:where was the light coming from? A particularly gifted student talked him into anotherexperiment. It is known that when ethidium bromide isapplied to samples of DNA, it insinuates itself in betweenthe base pairs of the double helix, causing DNA tounwind. The student suggested that, after applying thechemical, they measure the light coming from the sample.Popp found that the greater the concentration of ethidium,the more the DNA unraveled, but also the stronger theintensity of light. Conversely, the less he used, the lesslight was emitted. He also found that DNA could send out a wide range of frequencies, some of which seemed to be linked to certainfunctions. If DNA stored this light, it would naturally emitmore light on being unzipped. 12 www.edskilling.comOnce the photon has excited a reaction it returns to the field and is available for more reactions... We are swimming in an ocean of light.\"SECTION 1: ENERGY AND THE HUMAN BODYThese and other studies proved to Popp that one of the most essential sources of light and biophoton emissionswas DNA. DNA was like the master tuning fork of thebody. It would strike a particular frequency and certainmolecules would follow. It was also possible, he realized,that he had stumbled upon the missing link in current DNAtheory that could account for perhaps the greatest miracleof all in human biology -- how a single cell can turn intoa fully formed human being. How Cells Talk to Each Other When you get a cut or scratch on your skin, the cells that are injured somehow signal the surrounding healthy cellsto begin reproducing copies of themselves to fill in andmend the opening. When the skin is back to normal, asignal is sent to the cells to tell them to stop reproducing.Scientists have wondered exactly how this works. With bio-photon emissions, Popp believed he had an answer to this question. This phenomenon of coordinationand communication could only occur in a holistic systemwith one central conductor. Popp showed in hisexperiments that these weak light emissions were sufficientto orchestrate the body's repairs. The emissions had to below intensity, because these communications took placeon a very small, intracellular, quantum level. Higherintensities would have an effect only in the world of thelarge and would create too much \"noise\" to be effective. The number of photons emitted seemed to be linked to the organism's position on the evolutionary scale, the morecomplex the organism, the fewer photons were emitted. In one series of studies, Popp had one of his assistants, a 27-year-old healthy young woman, sit in the room everyday for nine months while he took photon readings of asmall area of her hand and forehead. Popp thenanalyzed the data and discovered, to his surprise, thatthe light emissions followed certain set patterns, biologicalrhythms at 7, 14, 32, 80 and 270 days, and similaritieswere also noted by day or night, by week and by month,as though the body were following the world's biorhythmsas well as its own. Cancer is a Loss of Coherent Light So far, Popp had studied only healthy individuals and found an exquisite coherence at the quantum level. Butwhat kind of light is present in those who are ill? Popp tried out his machine on a series of cancer patients. In every instance, these patients had lost those naturalperiodic rhythms as well as their coherence. The lines ofinternal communication were scrambled. They had losttheir connection and rythmic \"balance\" with the world.In effect, their light was going out. Just the opposite is seen with multiple sclerosis: MS is a state of too much order. Patients with this disease aretaking in too much light, thereby inhibiting their cells'ability to do their job. Too much cooperative harmonyprevented flexibility and individuality -- like too manysoldiers marching in step as they cross a bridge, causingit to collapse. Perfect coherence (balance) is an optimalstate between chaos and order. With too muchcooperation, it is as though individual members of theorchestra are no longer able to improvise. Popp also examined the effects of stress. In a stressed state, the rate of bio-photon emissions goes up, a defensemechanism designed to restore the patient's equilibrium.Popp now recognized that what he'd been experimentingwith was even more than a cure for cancer. Here was amodel that provided a better explanation than the currentneo-Darwinist theory for how living things evolve on theplanet. Rather than a system of fortunate but ultimatelyrandom error, if DNA uses frequencies of every variety asan information tool, this suggests a feedback system ofperfect communication through waves that encode andtransfer information. \"Good Vibes\" Means Coherent Light Popp came to realize that light in the body might even hold the key to health and illness. In one experiment, hecompared the light from free-range hens' eggs with thatfrom penned-in, caged hens. The photons in the formerwere far more coherent than those in the latter. www.edskilling.com 13SECTION 1: ENERGY AND THE HUMAN BODYPopp went on to use biophoton emissions as a tool for measuring the quality of food. The healthiest food hadthe lowest and most coherent intensity of light. Anydisturbance in the system increased the production ofphotons. Health was a state of perfect subatomiccommunication, and ill health was a state ofcommunication breakdown. We are ill when our energywaves are out of synch. Biophoton emission detection is currently used commercially in the food industry. Agricultural science islooking at biophoton emissions todetermine plant health for thepurposes of food quality control. It took some 25 years for Popp to gather converts from among thescientific community. Slowly, a fewselect scientists around the globebegan to consider that the body'scommunication system might be acomplex network of resonance andfrequency. Eventually, they wouldform the International Institute ofBiophysics, composed of 15 groupsof scientists from internationalcenters around the world. Popp and his new colleagues went on to study the light emissions fromseveral organisms of the samespecies, first in an experiment with a type of water flea ofthe genus Daphnia. What they found was nothing shortof astonishing. Tests with a photo-multiplier showed thatthe water fleas were sucking up the light emitted fromeach other. Popp tried the same experiment on small fishand got the same result. According to his photo-multiplier,sunflowers were like biological vacuum cleaners, movingin the direction of the most solar photons to vacuum themup. Even bacteria swallowed photons from the media theywere put in. Communication Between Organisms Thus, it dawned on Popp that these emissions had a purpose outside of the body. Wave resonance wasn't onlybeing used to communicate inside the body, but betweenliving things as well. Two healthy beings engaged in'photon sucking', as he called it, by exchanging photons.Popp realized that this exchange might unlock the secretof some of the animal kingdom's most persistentconundrums: how schools of fish or flocks of birds createperfect and instantaneous coordination. Many experiments on the homing abilityof animals demonstrate that it hasnothing to do with followinghabitual trails, scents or even theEM fields of the earth, but rathersome form of silent communicationthat acts like an invisible rubberband, even when the animals areseparated by miles of distance. For humans, there was another possibility. If we could take in thephotons of other living things, wemight also be able to use theinformation from them to correctour own light if it went awry. Popp had begun experimenting with such an idea. If cancer-causing chemicals could alter thebody's biophoton emissions, then it might be that other substances could reintroduce bettercommunication. Popp wondered whether certain plantextracts could change the character of the biophotonemissions from cancer cells to make them communicateagain with the rest of the body. He began experimentingwith a number of non-toxic substances purported to besuccessful in treating cancer. In all but one instance, thesesubstances only increased the photons from tumor cells,making them even more deadly to the body. 14 www.edskilling.comHealth was a state of perfect subatomic communication, and ill health was a state of communication breakdown. We are ill when our energy waves are out of synch. SECTION 1: ENERGY AND THE HUMAN BODYThe single success story was mistletoe, which appeared to help the body to \"re-socialize\" the photon emissions oftumor cells back to normal. In one of numerous cases,Popp came across a woman in her thirties who had breastand vaginal cancer. Popp found a mistletoe remedy that\"created coherence\" in her cancer tissue samples. Withthe agreement of her doctor, the woman stopped anytreatment other than the mistletoe extract and, after ayear, all her laboratory tests were virtually back tonormal. To Popp, homoeopathy was another example of photon sucking. He had begun to think of it as a 'resonanceabsorber'. Homoeopathy rests upon the notion that like istreated with like. A plant extract that at full strength cancause hives in the body is used in an extremely dilutedform to get rid of it. If a rogue frequency in the body canproduce certain symptoms, it follows that a high dilutionof a substance that can produce the same symptomswould also carry that frequency. Like a resonating tuningfork, a suitable homoeopathic solution might attract andthen absorb the abnormal oscillations, allowing the bodyto return to normal \"balance\" and health. Popp thought that electro-magnetic molecular signaling might even explain acupuncture. According to TraditionalChinese Medicine, the human body has a system ofmeridians, running deep in the tissues, through whichflows an invisible energy the Chinese call Chi, or the lifeforce. The Chi energy supposedly enters the body throughthese acupuncture points and flows to deeper organstructures, which do not correspond to those in Westernbiology, providing energy (or the life force.) Illness occurswhen this energy is blocked, or interfered with at anypoint along the pathways. According to Popp, themeridian system transmits specific energy waves tospecific zones of the body. Research has shown that many of the acupuncture points have a dramatically reduced electrical resistancecompared with the surrounding skin (10 kilo-ohms and 3mega-ohms, respectively). Orthopedic surgeon Dr. RobertBecker, who has done a great deal of research on EMfields in the body, designed a special electrode recordingdevice that rolls along the body like a pizza cutter. Hismany studies have shown electrical charges on every oneof the people tested corresponding to the Chinesemeridian points. Source: The Field: The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe, by Lynne McTaggart The Light Energy in Our Food Popp began thinking about light in nature. Light was present in plants and was used during photosynthesis.When we eat plant foods, he thought, it must be that wetake up the photons and store them. When we consume broccoli, for example, and digest it, it is metabolized into carbon dioxide (CO2) and water,plus the light stored from the sun and photosynthesis. Weextract the CO2 and eliminate the water, but the light, anelectro-magnetic wave, must be stored. When taken in bythe body, the energy of these photons dissipates andbecomes distributed over the entire spectrum of electro-magnetic frequencies, from the lowest to the highest. This energy is the driving force for all the molecules in our body. Photons switch on the body's processes like aconductor bringing each individual instrument into thecollective sound. At different frequencies, they performdifferent functions. Popp found that molecules in the cellsresponded to certain frequencies, and that a range ofvibrations from the photons caused a variety offrequencies in other molecules of the body. Light wavesalso answered the question of how the body manages tocarry out complicated feats with different body partsinstantaneously, or do two or more things at once. Popp went on to use biophoton emissions as a tool for measuring the quality of food. The healthiest food hadthe lowest and most coherent intensity of light. Anydisturbance in the system increased the production ofphotons. Health was a state of perfect subatomiccommunication, and ill health was a state ofcommunication breakdown. We are ill when our wavesare out of synch. www.edskilling.com 15SECTION 1: ENERGY AND THE HUMAN BODYHow Sound, Light and Electromagnetic Radiation Can Heal the Body The body is comprised of electro-magnetic radiation. It emits electro-magnetic waves and responds to electro-magnetic waves. All biological functions correspond toelectromagnetic phenomena. The electromagneticenergies that exist in living tissue are extremely potent.When you target a living cell with the energy that itneeds, it will respond favorably, and health can berestored in an amazingly short period of time. Electro-medicine covers a vast territory of different energies. The therapies discussed here and following,i.e., electro-magnetic radiation, frequency harmonicstherapy, far infrared energy, electrical current, oscillatingand pulsed magnetic fields, radio waves, light and soundtherapy are each and all part of the Photon Geniustransmission system. Conventional physics does notregard sound as part of the electromagnetic spectrum perse. However, every frequency in the electromagneticspectrum has a corresponding sound (vibration), even ifwe cannot hear it. Thus, audible and inaudible sound hasan intricate relationship to electro-magnetic frequenciesand can also be utilized for healing. The Photon GeniusThe Photon Genius is essentially an Energy-Medicine Instrument that provides the following energies andtherapies for use by the human body: 1. Electrical Energy - after all, the human body is electric and needs electrical current to run,providing nerve impulses and communicationsfor controlling mitosis to thought, cellularcommunication to healing, intelligence toconsciousness and self-awareness, and from painto pleasure, et al. 2. Electro-magnetic Energy - all electrical fields produce a corresponding electromagnetic fieldand the body's fields can now be seen andmeasured. EM fields provide communication,health and many other benefits.3. BioPhotonic Energy - while long suspected and/or known, the human body and each cellin the body produce light from its DNA.However, only until recently have scientists beenable to accurately verify and measure this photo-biotic energy known as biophotons. Our bodiesare swimming in an ocean of light. 4. Frequency Harmonics - the body needs both frequency and harmonic frequencies to operate ina balanced, healthy manner. Healthy cells operatein a specific harmonic oscillation and abnormalcells operate at a lower harmonic frequency andopposite polarity, producing anaerobic energyrather than healthy aerobic energy. Frequencyharmonics are generated and controlled by Skillingproprietary electronic transmission of electrical andelectromagnetic energy. 5. Energy Infrared Radiation - Specific light and energy frequencies, such as Skilling proprietaryEnergy Infrared, are essential to good health.80% of the sun's rays are infrared. The PhotonGenius provides a full spectrum range of near tofar infrared transmission. The Photon Geniusallows the user to control and administer (settingsfrom zero to ten) any infrared micron size waves,energy and intensity transmitted. The PhotonGenius converts infrared emitters to newlydeveloped Energy Infrared Transmitters that canbe \"targeted\" to any/all parts of the body. 6. Ionized Noble Gas Technology - produces the Skilling proprietary Noble Gas frequencyharmonics transmitted by the Photon Genius andprovides the body with harmonic energy,electrons and photons, to harmonize thebody's natural impedance, devitalizing pathogens and re-invigorating andreturning abnormal cells to their previousbalanced healthy state while assisting the body inreturning to a natural homeostasis. 7. Heat Therapy - is provided naturally with the controllable infrared transmission penetratingdeeply into the cells, tissues and organs of thebody providing controlled and \"targeted\"hyperthermia benefits. 16 www.edskilling.comSECTION 1: ENERGY AND THE HUMAN BODY8. Sauna Therapy - is also provided by the Photon Genius that is probably the most innovative non- biochemical approach to body detoxificationever created. Energy Infrared Heating iscompletely controllable and targetable. 9. Anti-oxidative Therapy - is provided through the introduction of ozone, and thereafter convertedto hydrogen peroxide in the body, through theskin. Pathogens cannot survive in the presenceof ozone, hydrogen peroxide or Nitric Oxide,yet the cells are assisted in receiving oxygen fromthe blood through these beneficial substancesand this improved circulation. 10. Light Therapy - is also provided with the proprietary Noble Gas Tube Technology withfour groups of vacuum-sealed noble gas tubesthat are ionized in a plasma state to produce thedynamics of frequency harmonics transmittedthrough different healing colors producingdifferent harmonic frequencies of bio-photonicenergy at the same time. There are 150 linearfeet of Noble Gas tubes providing the greatestharmonic frequency concentration andtransmission in the widest range and intensity ofany instrument in existence. 11. Nitric Oxide Therapy - is provided from the Energy Infrared Transmission and Skilling NobleGas Technology and produces Nitric Oxide inthe body. Nitric oxide is considered the body's\"miracle molecule\" and is documented to beessential to correct many conditions of the bodyfrom diabetes to hypertension, cancer to drugaddiction, stroke to intestinal motility, memoryand learning disorders to septic shock, sunburnto anorexia, male impotence to tuberculosis.There is probably no pathological conditionwhere Nitric Oxide does not have a positiveimpact. 12. Fitness and Health - in addition to the above, Skilling Energy Infrared has been shown to assistin weight management. One well administeredsession can burn up to 700 calories inapproximatey 30-40 minutes. Infrared has beenshown to reduce cellulite and to dramaticallyimprove and revitalize skin. Most who use thePhoton Genius detoxify the skin, reduceblemishes, reduce wrinkles, promote elasticity ofskin and tissues, reduce pain and improve overallconditioning of the body. Please read the following sections for the extensiveresearch documenting and supporting these and otherbenefits of the amazing Photon Genius. No otherinstrument in the world provides full spectrum EnergyInfrared with full spectrum Frequency Harmonicsdelivering some of the greatest health benefits ever seen.The Photon Genius operates at the physical, cellular,atomic, quantum and subtle energy levels to provideunparalleled harmonic energy to the human body in asafe and natural manner \"powering up\" the immunesystem and special forces of the body.

Donot confuse this with UV radiation (sunburn) or atomicradiation (nuclear) - see the diagram on the following pagefor where these types of light fall on the spectrum. Infrared waves are not visible to human eyes but can be seen by special instruments that translate infrared intocolors that are visible to our eyes. The best example is thesun (80% of the sun's rays are infrared). Our atmosphereallows infrared rays in the 7 to 14 micron range to safelyreach earth's surface. When warmed, the earth radiatesinfrared rays with its peak output at 10 microns. Thehuman body radiates infrared energy out through the skinat 3 to 50 microns, with most around 9.4 microns. Infrared therapy has the ability to penetrate, refract, radiate and reflect. The human body can absorb Infraredbecause of its deep penetrating ability. When Infraredpenetrates through skin to the subcutaneous tissues, ittransforms from light energy into heat energy. The thermaleffect within the deep layers of the tissues causes bloodsvessels and capillaries to dilate, promoting better bloodcirculation, and the heat thus produced helps rid the bodyof toxins and metabolic wastes through sweating. Infrared energy that is absorbed by human cells causes a physical phenomenon called \"resonance.\" Thus thecellular activities are instantly invigorated, resulting inbetter blood circulation and an overall improvedmetabolism. The quicker metabolic rate causes extra toxicwaste products to be purged from the body through theskin during perspiration. The skin is often referred to asthe third kidney, because it is believed to be responsiblefor eliminating 30% of the body's waste. Nitric Oxide Production Infrared Technology has been shown to produce nitric oxide, referred to as the \"miracle molecule.\" In fact, theNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1998 wasawarded jointly to Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro andFerid Murad \"for their discoveries concerning nitric oxideas a signaling molecule in the cardiovascular system\".Infrared Rays activate enzymes that stimulate theproduction of Nitric Oxide, a key biological messenger,playing a role in a variety of biological processes. Dr. Toshiko Yamazaki, MD owns a Far-infrared therapy clinic in Japan where they have done extensive researchon the uses of Infrared Therapy or Infrared Light Therapy.In the book, The Science of Far-Infrared Therapie s, they explain that one of the reasons Infrared Therapy hasbeneficial results in a variety of illnesses is the ability ofFar-infrared waves to remove toxins including mercurydetoxification, which is often at the core of many healthproblems. Since humans are bio-accumulators, numeroustoxins that disturb natural body functions and cannot beremoved immediately are stored in our bodies and preventnatural body healing. Benefits of InfraredDr. Toshio Yamazaki, the author of The Science of Far Infrared Ray Therapy and other books, notes the following health improvements with FAR Infrared technology: \u0081 Asthma, Bronchitis (cleared up) \u0081 Rheumatoid Arthritis (7 out of 10 cases resolved in one clinical trial) \u0081 Cancer pain (greatly relieved)\u0081 Cirrhosis of the Liver (reversed)\u0081 Crone's disease (cleared)\u0081 and feet (gone)\u0081 High Blood pressure (reduced)\u0081 Keloids (significantly softened and in some cases completely gone) \u0081 Leg ulcers (healed)\u0081 Radiation sickness (relieved signs and symptoms) \u0081 Teenage skin problems (cleared)\u0081 Tinnitus (chronic case cleared in 10 treatments)\u0081 Eczema and (responded well)\u0081 Pain Relief Source: Creighton University Medical SchoolSection 2: Energy Infrared WHAT IS INFRARED?www.edskilling.com 19 SECTION 2: ENERGY INFRAREDSAUNA THERAPY AND INFRARED SAUNA THERAPY FAR Infrared sauna therapy is said to duplicate the healthy frequencies of our own cells. The tissues are purported toselectively absorb these rays as the water in the cell reactsin a process called resonant absorption . This resonant absorption is said to occur when thefrequency of the FAR Infrared matches the frequency ofthe water in the cell. This causes toxins from the cells tobe put out into the blood stream and excreted in sweat,feces, and urine. Proponents of this therapy state that our tissues, which are undergoing the healing process, may need a boost of FARInfrared to ensure the fullest healing response. FAR Infrared is claimed to penetrate the body's tissues to a depth of 1.5 to 3 inches. Due to the deep penetration of FAR Infrared rays, a heating effect is observed deep in the muscular tissuesand even into the internal organs. This \"deep heating,\" along with sweating, is thought to be responsible for the healing effects and the other healthbenefits associated with these FAR Infrared rays. History of Sauna and Infrared SaunaPalm healing, a type of healing in which one person lies their palm on the \"patient,\" has a 3000 year old traditionin China. This technique is based on the healing propertiesof the natural infrared rays that we as humans give off. The Finns popularized sauna use. It seems that the saunas were originally used for bathing, as well as childbirth andsome ceremonies. The tradition came with the Finns whenthey migrated from an area northwest of present dayTibet, between 5000 and 3000 BC, to their presentlocation in Finland. During travel, the sauna probablyresembled the sweat lodges of the American Indians -holes dug in the ground covered with a cloth. The firstrecorded wooden saunas date to sometime between the5th and 8th centuries. Today, there is one sauna for everytwo to three Finns and sauna design is a revered art. Numerous saunas appear along the Mediterranean and the world's first bathtub appears in the palace of KingMinos of Crete in 1700 BC. Native American sweat lodges have been used for thousands of years in North and South America and weredocumented with the European invasion of the WesternHemisphere. Whole body infrared therapy has been used for greater than 80 years by German physicians in an independentlydeveloped form. Dr. Tadashi Ishikowa of Japan received a patent on the zirconia ceramic FAR Infrared heaters in 1965. Thesewere mostly used exclusively by medical practitioners inJapan until they were released for public use in 1979. The infrared idea has been further refined and sold in the United States since 1981. Chinese researchers consider the band from 2 to 25 microns as the most therapeutic. Source: Creighton University of Medicine ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM20 www.edskilling.com SECTION 2: ENERGY INFRAREDHeat therapy, also called thermotherapy, is the application of heat to the body for pain relief and health. It can takethe form of a hot cloth, hot water, ultrasound, heating pad,hydrocollator packs, whirlpool baths, cordless Infraredheat therapy wrap, and many others. It can be beneficialto those with arthritis and stiff muscles and injuries to thedeep tissue of the skin. Heat may be an effective self-caretreatment for conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. Heat therapy is most commonly used for rehabilitation purposes. Thetherapeutic effects of heat includeincreasing the extensibility of collagentissues; decreasing joint stiffness;reducing pain; relieving musclespasms; reducing inflammation,edema, and aids in the post acutephase of healing; and increasingblood flow. The increased blood flowto the affected area provides proteins,nutrients, and oxygen for betterhealing. Heat creates higher tissue temperatures, which producesvasodilation that increases thesupply of oxygen, and nutrients andthe elimination of carbon dioxideand metabolic waste. Heat therapy is useful for muscle spasms, myalgia, fibromyalgia,contracture, and bursitis. Another use is the treatment of infection and cancers by the use of heat. Cancer cells and many bacteria havepoor mechanisms for adapting to and resisting thephysiological stresses of heat, and are more vulnerable toheat-induced death than normal cells.FAR Infrared radiation FAR Infrared radiation is a convenient system to heat parts of our body. It has the advantage over direct contact inthat FAR Infrared can heat directly the area where theblood capillaries and neuron terminals are. When heatcomes from a direct contact source it has to heat theexternal layer of the skin, and heat is transferred to the deeper layer by conduction. Heat therapy can be used for the treatment of headaches andmigraines. Many people who sufferfrom chronic headaches also sufferfrom tight muscles in their neck andupper back. The application ofconstant heat to the back/upperback area can help to release thetension associated with headachepain. In order to achieve heattherapy for headaches, many usemicrowaveable pads which canoften overheat, potentially leadingto injury, and lose their heat after afew minutes. Some new productsuse heated water, running throughpads, to maintain a constanttemperature, allowing headachesufferers to use hands-free heattherapy in the treatment of theirheadache pain. In the natural sciences, the term diathermy means\"electrically induced heat\" and is commonly used formuscle relaxation. It is also a method of heating tissueelectromagnetically or ultrasonically for therapeuticpurposes in medicine.

NO can literally be a matter of life and death.\" Dr. Louis IgnarroSECTION 3: LIGHT AND SOUND THERAPY www.edskilling.com 21Music and Sound therapy is an allied health profession and one of the expressive therapies, consisting of aninterpersonal process in which a trained music/soundtherapist uses music and all of its facets\u2014physical,emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual\u2014to helpclients to improve or maintain their health. Music therapists primarily help clients improve their health across various domains (e.g., cognitive functioning, motorskills, emotional and affective development, behavior andsocial skills, and quality of life) by using musicexperiences (e.g., free improvisation, singing,songwriting, listening to and discussing music, moving tomusic) to achieve treatment goals and objectives. It isconsidered both an art and a science, with a qualitativeand quantitative research literature base incorporatingareas such as clinical therapy, biomusicology, musicalacoustics, music theory, psychoacoustics, embodied musiccognition, aesthetics of music, and comparativemusicology. Referrals to music therapy services may bemade by other health care professionals such asphysicians, psychologists, physical therapists, andoccupational therapists. Music therapists are found in nearly every area of the helping professions. Some commonly found practicesinclude developmental work (communication, motor skills,etc.) with individuals with special needs, songwriting andlistening in reminiscence/orientation work with theelderly, processing and relaxation work, and rhythmicentrainment for physical rehabilitation in stroke victims.Music therapy is also used in some medical hospitals,cancer centers, schools, alcohol and drug recoveryprograms, psychiatric hospitals, and correctionalfacilities. The Turco-Persian psychologist and music theorist al- Farabi (872-950), known as \"Alpharabius\" in Europe,dealt with music therapy in his treatise Meanings of the Intellect , where he discussed the therapeutic effects of music on the soul. Robert Burton wrote in the 17th centuryin his classic work, The Anatomy of Melancholy, thatmusic and dance were critical in treating mental illness,especially melancholia. History of Music TherapyMusic has been used as a healing force for centuries. Music therapy goes back to biblical times, when Davidplayed the harp to rid King Saul of a bad spirit. As earlyas 400 B.C., Hippocrates, Greek father of medicine,played music for his mental patients. Aristotle describedmusic as a force that purified the emotions. In thethirteenth century, Arab hospitals contained music-roomsfor the benefit of the patients. In the United States, NativeAmerican medicine men often employed chants anddances as a method of healing patients. Music therapy aswe know it began in the aftermath of World Wars I andII. Musicians would travel to hospitals, particularly in theUnited Kingdom, and play music for soldiers sufferingfrom war-related emotional and physical trauma. Music Therapy in Heart DiseaseAccording to a 2009 Cochrane review of 23 clinical trials, it was found that some music may reduce heart rate,respiratory rate, and blood pressure in patients withcoronary heart disease. Benefits included a decrease inblood pressure, heart rate, and levels of anxiety in heartpatients. However, the effect was not consistent acrossstudies, according to Joke Bradt, PhD, and Cheryl Dileo,PhD, both of Temple University in Philadelphia. Music didnot appear to have much effect on patients' psychologicaldistress. \"The quality of the evidence is not strong and theclinical significance unclear\", the reviewers cautioned. In11 studies patients were having cardiac surgery andprocedures, in nine they were MI patients, and in threecardiac rehabilitation patients. The 1,461 participantswere largely white (average 85%) and male (67%). Inmost studies, patients listened to one 30-minute musicsession. Only two used a trained music therapist insteadof prerecorded music. Music Therapy in EpilepsyResearch suggests that listening to Mozart's piano sonata K448 can reduce the number of seizures in people withepilepsy. This has been called the \"Mozart effect.\"However, in recent times, the validity of the \"MozartEffect\" and the studies upon which the theory is basedhave been questioned, due to reasons such as thelimitations in the original study and the failure to replicatethe effects of Mozart's music in subsequent studies. The sonic affects of sound and music and the human body has been recognized in the United States since 1944.The National Association for Music Therapy was foundedin 1950 and was merged with The American Associationfor Music Therapy, founded in 1971, in 1998 to formThe American Music Therapy Association. Many of thestudies in sound and music therapy are only nowemerging as recognized major therapeutical benefits tothe body.

Common use of the term is associated with the treatment ofskin disorders (chiefly psoriasis),sleep disorder and somepsychiatric disorders. Light therapydirected at the skin is also used totreat acne vulgaris, eczema andneonatal jaundice. Light therapywhich used to treat circadian rhythmdisorders such as delayed sleepphase syndrome and can also beused to treat seasonal affectivedisorder, with some support for its use also with non-seasonalpsychiatric disorders. Other medical applications of light therapy also include painmanagement, accelerated woundhealing, hair growth, improvementin blood properties and bloodcirculation, and sinus-relateddiseases and disorders. Many of these use low level lasertherapy and red light therapy in the 620-660 nm range. History of Light TherapyMany ancient cultures practiced various forms of heliotherapy, including people of the Ancient Greece,Ancient Egypt, and Ancient Rome. The Inca, Assyrian andearly German settlers also worshipped the sun as a healthbringing deity. Indian medical literature dating to 1500BC describes a treatment combining herbs with naturalsunlight to treat non-pigmented skin areas. Buddhistliterature from about 200 AD and 10th-century Chinesedocuments made similar references. Faroese physician Niels Finsen is believed to be the father of modern phototherapy. He developed the first artificial light source for this purpose, andused his invention to treat lupusvulgaris. He received the NobelPrize in Physiology or Medicine in1903. Since then a large array of treatments have been developedfrom the use of controlled light.Though the popular consumerunderstanding of \"light therapy\" like psoriasis, otherapplications include the applicationof low level laser, red light, near-infrared and ultraviolet lights forpain management, hair growth,skin treatments, and acceleratedwound healing. Much research has been done on light therapy to date. Recent research suggests that light therapy may ease Parkinson'sdisease by reducing patient's tremors. A qualitative studyconducted on a 20-person cohort of women andpublished in 2011 suggested a positive impact of lighttherapy on overall cognitive function in Alzheimer'sdisease patients, a preliminary finding requiring largerand quantitative studies to confirm.

It means very low amperageelectrical currents or electro-magnetic waves that travelthrough the body. There are many kinds of \"electro-medicine\" devices. Unlike the electro-medicine devices oforthodox medicine, electro-medicine devices in alternativemedicine do not kill any normal cells. Nor do they kill any\"abnormal\" cells; rather they may improve health usingspecialized electric and electromagnetic fields that alterthe function or condition of targeted tissue, organisms, orcells within the body. These electric fields can be programmed to promote the healing of healthy tissue or inhibit the growth of undesiredorganisms. Where there are electric fields, there are alsomagnetic fields, usually rotated at 90 degrees to eachother. The interplay of the electric and magnetic fieldsplay a role in this therapy, but the frequency, the shape ofthe wave, the duration and polarity of the pulse, etc., allplay into the mix and can make the difference betweensuccess or failure depending on the care and attentiongiven to these parameters. Some diseases are thought to be caused by an imbalance between the immune system and the number of abnormalcells that form. When the immune system is weakened oran unusually high number of abnormal cells form, thenumber of abnormal cells can overwhelm the immunesystem. However, while the balance between the immune system and the number of abnormal cells which form may \"causedisease,\" this imbalance is not what causes a normal cellto become abnormal. A normal cell is thought to become abnormal when a highly pleomorphic \"cell wall deficient\" bacteria is ableto get inside of a normal cell. Once inside the cell thisbacterium blocks the formation of ATP molecules inside thecell (aerobic). The cell then reverts to fermentation to createATP molecules (anaerobic) and the cell is then defined tobe \"abnormal.\" The fermentation is caused by a reactionof the cell to the \"cell wall deficient\" bacteria. A NobelPrize was given in 1931 (Otto Heinrich Warburg) for thediscovery that an abnormal cell is anaerobic.Note that DNA damage does not cause a cell to becomeabnormal, rather DNA damage is the result of the DNAof the bacteria interacting with the DNA of the cell. Pleasesee the Independent Research Foundation, Inc. for moreinformation. What this means is that if you can kill the microbe inside the abnormal anaerobic cell, the cell will be able torestore its normal metabolism and revert into a normalaerobic cell. Frequency and Frequency HarmonicsDiscoveries in the late 1920's and early 1930's by Royal Rife showed that all manner of disease organisms couldbe destroyed by merely 'tuning' a Frequency Generatorto the correct resonant frequency of these organisms andapplying the oscillating electric fields via the plasmadriven, \"Beam Ray Tube\". Everything in the universe,living or dead, has its own resonant frequency. If youapply this exact resonant frequency to the object ororganism, it will begin vibrating until it literally shattersitself. You've all seen the wine glass and the opera singerdemonstration. Research in the 1940's and 1950's byRife and other researchers attempted to catalogue thosefrequencies that \"destroy\" particular organisms and astrange thing occurred. Many frequencies began tooverlap and Rife and others began to suspect that thefrequencies were not killing pathogens but ratherproviding the body's immune system with the frequenciesto enable the strengthened body to kill off the pathogens.This is why Rife's work has never been able to beduplicated. It is now well established that there are a number of \"healing\" frequencies that do enable the body to be re-invigorated and strengthened which may permit theimmune system the ability to heal itself. Skilling's worksince the 1960's has focused in this direction. Rife technology was not even a totally new technology at that time. At the turn of the 19th century, Nikola Teslapatented many Electro-inventions that demonstratedincredible health-promoting attributes; some of thembased on the use of his high frequency, high voltage DC ELECTRO-MEDICINESection 4: Frequency TherapySECTION 4: FREQUENCY THERAPY 24 www.edskilling.compulse generator circuits which produced a new ether- derived form of energy called Radiant Energy. Tesla hadeven patented a highly efficient cold plasma ozonegenerator by 1893. Furthermore, Ed Skilling built on the work of Georges Lakhovsky. Lakhovsky had worked with hospitals in theapplication of frequency in the 1920s. Lakhovskyrecognized that cells have a naturalfrequency that keeps them healthyand resistant to viruses and otherpathogens. In order to restore thisnatural frequency, Lakhovskydeveloped a Multiple WaveOscillator to produce highfrequencies. The frequencies, in turn,produced a broad range ofharmonic frequencies. When an object is exposed to its natural frequency it will pick up orresonate with that frequency. This iswhat happens when two violinshave been precisely tuned. If thestring on one violin is plucked orvibrated, the same string on theother violin will start to vibrate aswell. When exposed to theharmonics produced by Lakhovsky'sMultiple Wave Oscillator, the cellscould pick up their natural frequencywith the results that their strength and health would beimproved. In a Radio News Magazine article published in February 1925, Lakhovsky wrote: \"In conclusion I wish to callattention of the reader to the fact that I have obtained veryconclusive results not only with a wavelength of two meters,but with longer and shorter wavelengths. The main thing isto produce the greatest number of harmonics possible.\" Skilling originally devoted his talents and genius to thedesign of an instrument incorporating the research ofLakhovsky and Rife to produce a healing frequency andalso a broad range of harmonic frequencies. Skilling didnot strive toward developing instruments for specificdiseases. Rather, he designed his original instrument tooutput 728 Hz, among others, which is the Rife frequencythought to be the most healing. This frequency is carried on a radio frequency wave totransport it to the body. This worksin the same way a radio transmittercarries the signal for a particularradio station so it can be receivedby a radio in any given area. Skilling's original instrument operated with a very gentle 100milliwatts of power, a lot lessintense than its Rife cousin. Thecarrier wave of 28.322 the 28.322MHz to create a great range ofharmonic frequencies - up into theGiga Hertz range. The cells can then pick up their resonant healthy frequency. Theimmune system can gradually growin strength, thus allowing the bodyto heal itself naturally rather than creating an artificial homeostasis through the use offrequencies. Skilling's instruments have continuallyimproved many times since 1959 and is now known asthe Photon Genie and the Photon Genius (the FDA hasnot evaluated the Photon Genie or Photon Genius and noinformation, technologies, formulas, or protocolsmentioned are intended to diagnose, treat, cure orprevent any disease). \"The only known \"cure\" for cancer is your own God given immune system. All I did is figure out how to communicate with it and power it up.\" Ed SkillingSECTION 4: FREQUENCY THERAPY www.edskilling.com 25The influence of the mind upon the body is assumed. The body's vast system of biochemical activity is beingrecognized as having its own qualities and laws ofbehavior running along the Myelin sheaths of the nervesusing the nervous system as its line of communicationthroughout the body. Just as the blood plasma itself seepsinto every cell of the body as lymph, electro-magneticenergy is present, asserting its influence in every cell andmolecule of the body. Electromagnetic energy has a special connection with the endocrine glands. Its flow is automatically responsive tothe psychological state of the individual, and acts as abridging influence, linking the psyche to the body, andinterlinking with the subjective life of the individual.Problems in metabolism appear to be influenced by themechanical and chemical environment but even moreimportantly from the subjective interaction ofelectromagnetic energy. Ed Skilling took the latest electro-medicine technologies and frequencies, and married them to the latest gaseoustube technology to create the remarkable Photon Genieand its predecessors. radio (RF) frequenciesare modulated by Skillling's \"healing\" frequencies andcomplimented with various Inert Gases to produce lightfrequencies (the ionized gases also produce several otherRF frequencies similar to the Lakhovsky multiwaveoscillator). If one wants to sterilize a lab, you would use ultraviolet light to kill all virus, bacteria, and fungus. Certain gasesgive off an ultraviolet component, just enough to beeffective. In other words, the ultraviolet enters at a levelthat virus, bacteria and fungus cannot tolerate, but canand will rejuvenate healthy cells. With the Skilling frequencies riding the wave form, a one- two punch is delivered. But the main effect of the therapyis to charge the particles, or cells, so that they repel eachother. Remember, each cell has a polarity, and when thatpolarity changes, they start to attract each other ratherthan repel. When this happens, energy blocks occur, theblood platelets clog the veins, the lymph fluid ceases, andthe whole system stops. Just like a gutter full of leaves,nothing can penetrate the blockage. Lumps and sorenessoccur. But by simply putting the charge back into the cellcorrectly, the cells and platelets start moving slowly apart.Not in dangerous hunks, but whispfully, one by one,dropping away from the knotted clump. Noble Gas technology offers profound advantages. As mentioned, when these special gases contained in glasstubes are ionized, a powerful photon-rich-electrical fieldis sent out into the air. A micro-current containing millionsof harmonic frequencies gently penetrates the bodythrough the skin. In addition a radio wave component isadded to carry the frequencies and subtle energy throughthe body without any distortion. In this way acomprehensive delivery of energy is achieved containinga holistic spectrum of photobiotic nutrition. Because the micro-current emitted from the Noble Gas tubes matches the electrical properties of the body, it isable to travel along both the subtle and gross energychannels. This includes the energy pathways of theconsciousness, those on the molecular level, as well asthe acupuncture meridians, the lymph channels and bloodvessels. Thus the gentle, yet penetrating photon energyfills the entire body as life-force energy rich in frequencyharmonics. The same electrical energy also breaks up bound protein matter and cells which have lost their normal electricalcharge. When the cells of our bodies lose their normalcharge they gather together and form clumps and clotsrather than maintain their individual integrity. Rare gastechnology can rapidly restore the normal energy stateand ideal frequency to every cell in the body. Every cell also resonates a unique characteristic frequency. This is why it is important to ionize the NobleGases with frequencies that are rich in harmonics. In otherwords, universal frequencies of Sacred Sounds are mostideal. These are frequencies which lie in the mid-soundrange and decades of research have shown that theycarry the most abundant simultaneous harmonicfrequencies. In this way each cell is able to match its ownresonate frequency amidst a vast array of harmonicfrequencies. Finally, Noble Gas tube technology delivers ENERGY MEDICINESECTION 4: FREQUENCY THERAPY 26 www.edskilling.coma powerful electrical field that restores the circulation of all the fluids in the body, especially the lymph and blood.The lymphatic system is connected to every organ in thebody and is absolutely essential in purifying the body andstrengthening the entire immune system. Many considerthe proper lymphatic drainage to be even more importantthan blood circulation. These fluids, however, require thepumping actions of movement and exercise which is oftenseverely limited in modern lifestyles. Perhaps, the most profound value of Noble Gas Technology lies in the exotic healing value of the gases themselves. Thesespecial elements provide an excellent medium for the transferof an electro-magnetic field of energy. Noble Gases (Helium, Argon, Neon, Xenon, Krypton) are the most unique of all the elements in the universe. Theyare called the Inert or Rare Gases because they arecompletely balanced in their number of electrons, protonsand neutrons. They do not easily react or combine withother elements. These special gases were once far moreabundant in the atmosphere. Many believe these gasespossess specific healing properties. Xenon, for example,opens us up to higher states of consciousness andregenerates the body. Whereas, Argon clears awaynegative thought-forms and has been the most thoroughlyresearched in the treatment and alleviation of infections.Krypton is noted to improve sensory abilities and improvebrain function. Helium connects one to dream states andcan alleviate insomnia. Most of these properties havebeen substantiated by clinical research. Photon energy is the other key element of the regenerative and rejuvenating value of Noble Gas Technology. Photo-biotic nutrition is the nutrition of light. It is the photon lightenergy we receive directly from the Sun or secondarilyfrom our food. Science has shown that photons emergefrom the non-physical realms and all electromagneticphenomena moves, manifests and changes through theexchange of photons on a quantum level. When the body is exposed to this photon energy as the gases are ionized, it is reminded of the essentialenlivening energy which then precipitates as matter.Balanced coherent energy flowing in the body is thoughtto equate to perfect health. When the body is dynamicallyflowing with balanced vibrant coherent energy there isno place for disease. The bottom line in achieving perfecthealth may surround three issues: eliminating toxins fromthe body, complete structural alignment, and access tophoto-biotic energy. All the energetic channels from subtleconsciousness to the blood and lymph must be open andfreely flowing, unobstructed by toxic debris on thephysical, mental and emotional level. Secondly, acompletely balanced skeletal system, including all thebones of the body, especially those in the skull, allows theenergy and the intelligence of the body to flow in balanceand harmony. Finally, one's individual consciousnessultimately determines overall health; no treatment orremedy can save an individual from themselves.Consciousness and physiology are intimately inter-related;one determines the other. It is important to attend to both..With the release of the Photon Genie, Ed Skilling hadachieved the highest state-of-the-art electro-medicalinstruments ever created. In fact, virtually all medicaldevices created since 1980 are either designed by EdSkilling or based on designs by Ed Skilling. Ed was theonly inventor since the 1950's that not only understoodand built on the work of the electro-medical giants of thepast, i.e., Tesla, Abrams, Rife, Lakhovsky, etc., but farsurpassed their efforts. It's simply not enough to laud theheroes from the past, Ed Skilling took the field of electro-medicine into the 21st Century almost single-handedly,and should be honored for the giant he is. Using the Photon Genie, Skilling often recommended using the device with heat. Skilling found that at 106degrees, the body activates certain deep healingprocesses. This combined technology eventually led to thedevelopment of the Photon Genius.SECTION 5: DETOXIFICATIONAccording to researchers and users around the World, the Photon Genie and Photon Genius provide some of the mostunique and impressive detoxification strategies andtechnologies of virtually any known protocol or instrument inexistence. The Photon Genius, for example, is the first andonly instrument that combines both Infrared light technology(Infrared) and frequency harmonics (commonly referred to aselectro-medicine or electromagnetic energy therapy). AddSauna Therapy and Thermo-therapy to the list of health benefits and Skilling has once again created the most powerful and multi-featuredinstrument of its kind. Frequency Generators, like the Photon Genie, produce FrequencyHarmonics and multi-waveelectromagnetic energy which havebeen shown to produce photo-bioticenergy and to create a dramaticallyimproved bio-oxidative, lymphaticand circulatory state within the body. Additionally, frequency harmonics use light and sound/(music) therapy,promote cellular resonance at the atomic level, produce key life-sustaining molecules such as nitricoxide (from Infrared), de-vitalize and destroy pathogens in the body (anti-oxidative and frequencyharmonics), strengthen the body'sown immune response (circulation oflymphatic and cardiovascular systemsand frequency harmonics), etc. These Skilling instruments may very well strengthen the body's own ability to combat serious health issues andproblems, while increasing metabolism and therebyaffecting weight management, circulation, elimination,rejuvenation, detoxification, etc. The list of researchedand patient represented health benefits is long andimpressive - the result -- a body in homeostasis. Over a lifetime (or in the case of an ecological disaster, an alarmingly short time), the human body assimilates anumber of toxins. Some of these are in such trace amountsthat we really needn't worry about them, but it is still wiseto avoid as many toxins in the diet and the environmentas possible. Here are ten of the most common toxinsfound in human blood and cells: Free RadicalsFree Radicals are the toxic waste products of the process of oxidation within our bodies. Oxidation (like rust on iron) is what causes thedeterioration of cells, like a bruisedapple when it goes brown andmushy. This goes on at a cellularlevel within the human body andaccelerates the aging process. Theeffects of free radicals can bereduced by the consumption of anti-oxidant-rich red, orange andyellow fruits and vegetables, alongwith eating less. Mercury The most common sources of mercury are amalgam fillings andthe eating of large marine fish suchas tuna. Mercury is implicated inParkinson's disease, Alzheimer's,heart failure, irregular heartbeatand even some cancers. There isdebate as to whether it isworthwhile to have amalgamfillings removed and replaced. Similarly, the health benefits of eating oily marine fishshould be weighed carefully against the risks of mercuryconsumption. Sugar Refined sugar is known as \"the white death\". We all know it's bad for us, that it contains calories without nutrients.Too much of it can cause insulin resistance and diabetes.The answer is simple; eat less white sugar. www.edskilling.com 27Section 5: Detoxification TOXINS When quantum coherence is restored to the biofield, the healing power of the body is now known to be literally limitless, dwarfing the benefits of any mere biochemical manipulation.SECTION 5: DETOXIFICATIONCaffeine Many people enjoy caffeinated drinks and find that they give them a much-needed \"boost\" in times of fatigue.Caffeine is a powerful drug and taking yourself off it cancause severe withdrawal symptoms. Some people are\"allergic\" to caffeine and it can cause irrational moodswings and exacerbation of PMS, even heartbeatirregularities. C-Reactive Protein Perhaps it is wrong to consider this a toxin in itself, but its presence in the blood is an indicator of inflammation in thebody. A high reading of C-ReactiveProtein in the blood can indicate apropensity to heart attack. It iselevated by infections, inflammatoryconditions, insulin resistance, andcertain hormones such as those inthe contraceptive pill or HRT. Cholesterol A buildup of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) or so-called \"bad\"cholesterol in the blood isimplicated in heart disease viahardening of the arteries. Avoidhigh cholesterol by eating lesssaturated fats, exercising regularly,eating supplements rich in plantsterols (Recent studies may changethis thinking in the near future). Cortisol At times of worry and stress, the body will produce Cortisol. Therefore, Cortisol is commonly called the stresshormone. Eliminate cortisol by exercising, laughing,relaxing, enjoying a hobby and not allowing your ownpersonal stresses to fester and thrive within you.Pesticides We encounter these in our own gardens (unless we garden totally organically) and on most store-bought fruitsand vegetables. At least trace amounts are probablyfound in most people's bodies. Either buy organic ormake sure you thoroughly wash any fruit and vegetablesyou buy. Dioxins These are unwanted byproducts of heating processes and can increase cancer risks. They are suspected ascontributory factors in diabetes, low sperm counts and behavioral problems. They areeverywhere so it is hard to avoidthem on an individual level. Buyingorganic produce and avoidingsaturated animal fats (which tend toharbor dioxins) may help. Homocysteine Homocysteine is an amino acid. It can contribute to the risks of heartdisease, Alzheimer's, furring of thearteries, toxicity in pregnancy, evenbirth defects. Homocysteine's build-up can be caused by kidney disease,genetics or vitamin deficiencies.Supplementation of Vitamins B12, B6and Folic Acid may be wise. Thesevitamins enable the conversion ofhomocysteine into less dangerousamino-acids in the body. We are all exposed to toxins in the environment and ourfood over our lifetimes. Some are easy to avoid, othersless so. Clean living and regular detoxification programsare probably the best we can do to avoid overexposureto toxins. 28 www.edskilling.com\"Your vascular network is more than twice as large as the circumference of the earth, yet your blood makes a complete voyage through the body about once a minute.\" Dr. Louis IgnarroSECTION 5: DETOXIFICATIONHealth can, in large measure, be dependent on one's understanding of the seven systems that the body uses toeliminate waste and toxic matters. When these systemsare working effectively the result is good health. Whenthey are compromised all types of complications canresult. To understand detoxification one needs to have aclear understanding of the body's channels of elimination. When the body confronts a toxin or foreign substance it uses these channels of elimination to purge the toxin asquickly as possible. The key to excellent health is havingthese seven channels of elimination functioning optimally. In 1904 a Russian Naturopathic Physician by the name of Eli Metchnikof discovered that the body would recycleany toxin that it was not capable of purging. In therecycling process the body would utilize all sevenchannels of elimination to try to eliminate the toxicsubstance from the body. If one's health has beencompromised there is often a direct correlation that oneor more of the body's channels of elimination are notworking effectively. The LiverThe Liver is the body's factory. It metabolizes food, filters toxins and converts ingredients into substances that areneeded in all parts of the body. Your liver is one of thelargest and most important organs in your body. The Liver,when healthy, will store vitamins, sugars, fats and othernutrients from the food that you eat. The Liver produceschemicals that your body needs to stay healthy andbreaks down harmful substances, like alcohol and othertoxic substances. The Liver also removes waste productsfrom the blood and makes sure that the body has just theright amount of other required chemicals. The LungsThe Lungs are in charge of breathing and require significant exercise. The best practices to keep the lungshealthy are physical exercise, fifteen minutes of deep-breathing exercises each day, and not to smoke. The Lymphatic SystemRegular exercise is one of the best treatments that your lymphatic system can benefit from helping to maintainboth clear pathways throughout the channels, and bystimulating the flow and drainage of the Lymphatic systemfluids. The Lymphatic is the body's filter system andsupports immune function. A healthy lymphatic systemhelps to filter out bacteria, fungi, viruses and other foreignorganisms. Herbs such as arabanogalactan are a naturalcleanser of the lymphatic system. The Blood and Circulatory SystemThe blood is a liquid organ which transfers and transports nutrients and other healthy substances throughout thebody. Red Clover and Chlorella are wonderful naturalcleansers of the blood system. Regular exercise stimulatesthe blood system and assists the body in eliminatingwaste. The SkinThe Skin is the body's largest organ. Perspiration naturally assists in cleansing the skin and keeping it elastic andhealthy. Using the Photon Genius which promotessweating is a wonderful health regimen for the skin. The ColonThe colon is vital to effective health because it serves the function of transporting waste out of the body. Hydrationof the digestion system will improve Colon Health. Also,hydrating the colon through Colon Hydrotherapy hasproven to be very beneficial to re-establishing health. The KidneysThe odds of developing a kidney stone during one's lifetime are approximately one in ten. In 1995, more than3 million people in the United States had some type ofkidney condition such as an infection, kidney stones orcancer. More than 300,000 people suffer from renalfailure each year and undergo dialysis, await a kidneytransplant, or both. The kidneys produce urine, the body's primary liquid waste. Often kidney problems are the result ofdehydration. A natural supplement that cleanses andprovides needed nutrition for the kidneys is Corn Silk. As stated previously, good health often depends on one's understanding of the seven channels of eliminationdiscussed above. We urge you to understand these sevenchannels of elimination and to do everything possible toassist them in your pursuit of excellent health. www.edskilling.com 29ELIMINATIONSECTION 5: DETOXIFICATIONThe lymphatic system works in close cooperation with other body systems to perform these important functions: \u0081 The lymphatic system aids the immune system in destroying pathogens and filtering waste so thatthe lymph can be safely returned to thecirculatory system. \u0081 The lymphatic system removes excess fluid, waste, debris, dead blood cells, pathogens,cancer cells, and toxins from these cells and thetissue spaces between them. \u0081 The lymphatic system also works with the circulatory system to deliver nutrients, oxygen,and hormones from the blood to the cells thatmake up the tissues of the body. Lymph vessels can become clogged with protein depositsleading to sluggish flow (congestion), impaired functionand the lymph becoming unable to drain properly.Instead, within these swollen tissues, the protein-rich lymphbecomes stagnant. When bacteria enter this fluid througha break in the skin, or otherwise, they thrive on thisprotein-rich fluid. It is for this reason that lymphedemaaffected tissues and other lymph-related conditions areprone to infections. The causes of lymphatic congestion range from injuries and surgery, inactivity and poor diet, to emotional/stressstates, environmental toxins, hormone imbalance, andnormal aging processes. When this state occurs, theblockages cause a backup in the flow of lymphatic fluid,resulting in swelling or edema in the tissues and in avariety of symptoms. Consequently, toxic waste mattercannot effectively be released from the body, nor can theimmune system function at optimum performance. Theresult is a wide range of dysfunction and disease. The Origin of LymphLymph originates as plasma, which is the fluid portion of blood. The arterial blood that flows out of the heart slowsas it moves through a capillary. This slowing allows someplasma to leave the arterioles and flow into the tissueswhere it becomes tissue fluid.\u0081 Also known as extracellular fluid, this is fluid that flows between the cells but is not found within the cells. This fluid delivers nutrients, oxygen, andhormones to the cells. \u0081 As this fluid leaves the cells, it takes with it cellular waste products and protein cells. \u0081 Approximately 90 percent of this tissue fluid flows into the venules. Here it enters the venouscirculation as plasma and continues in thecirculatory system. \u0081 The remaining 10 percent of the fluid that is left behind is now known as lymph. Blood Flow Compared with Lymphatic Flow The bloodstream is pumped by the heart. It circulates throughout the body and is cleansed by being filtered bythe kidneys. The lymphatic system does not have a pumpto aid in its flow and yet the lymphatic systems contain fivetimes more fluid than the blood in the circulatory system.Instead, the lymphatic system is designed so that lymphonly flows upward through the body traveling from theextremities (feet and hands) and upward through the bodytoward the neck. As it travels through the body, lymph passes through lymph nodes where it is filtered. At the base of the neck,the lymph enters the subclavian veins and once againbecomes plasma in the bloodstream. Lymph NodesThere are between 600 - 700 lymph nodes present in the average human body. It is the role of these nodes to filterthe lymph before it can be returned to the circulatorysystem. Although these nodes can increase or decrease insize throughout life, any nodes that have been damagedor destroyed, do not regenerate. \u0081 Afferent lymphatic vessels carry unfiltered lymph into the node. Here waste products, and some ofthe fluid, are filtered out. \u0081 In another section of the node, lymphocytes, which are specialized white blood cells, killpathogens that may be present. This causes theswelling commonly known as swollen glands. 30 www.edskilling.comTHE LYMPHATIC SYSTEMSECTION 5: DETOXIFICATION\u0081 Lymph nodes also trap cancer cells and slow the spread of the cancer until they are overwhelmed by it through the process known as matastasis. \u0081 Efferent lymphatic vessels carry the filtered lymph out of the node to continue its return to thecirculatory system. Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD) A therapeutic technique known as manual lymph drainage (MLD) was developed in Europe 25 years ago.Through delicate massaging techniques it was highlyeffective at reducing lymph-based disorders through thesubsequent detoxification process. However, this therapyis tedious, time intensive, and requires extensive trainingand experience to administer correctly. Within the last several decades electro-medicine devices like the Photon Genie and its predecessors were improvedto the point where they could assist, amplify and in somecases replace the effects of manual lymph drainage.Some therapists immediately noted that the electro-medicine therapy was eight times faster than MLD alone.The Photon Genie and Photon Genius are based ontechnology using emissions of specific light wavelengthscombined with harmonics of sound generated via ionizednoble gases (plasma) in glass transmitters to reduce andeliminate lymphatic system blockages and to improvelymph flow throughout the body. These Skilling instrument innovations revolutionized the existing science of MLD while creating numerous newapplications including the powerful effects of lymphatictherapy for enhancing relaxation, detoxification, cellulitetherapy, and facial work. The equine and veterinary fieldshave many uses for the technology as well. The PhotonGenie and Genius are now often referred to as LymphMachines, though that description represents only afraction of their technology and health benefits.The Health Benefits of Improved Lymphatic Drainage andFlow include: \u0081 Improvements with edemas, fibrotic conditions, and swollen lymph nodes.

In humans, it is the largest organ of the integumentary system. The skinhas multiple layers of ectodermal tissue and guards theunderlying muscles, bones, ligaments and internal organs.Human skin is similar to that of most other mammals,except that it is not protected by a pelt. Though nearly allhuman skin is covered with hair follicles, it appearshairless. There are two general types of skin, hairy andglabrous skin. The adjective cutaneous literally means \"ofthe skin\" (from Latin cutis, skin). Because it interfaces with the environment, skin plays a key role in protecting (the body) against pathogens andexcessive water loss. Its other functions are insulation,temperature regulation, sensation, synthesis of vitamin D,and the protection of vitamin B folates. Severely damagedskin will try to heal by forming scar tissue. This is oftendiscolored and depigmented. In humans, skin pigmentation varies among populations, and skin type can range from dry to oily. Such skin varietyprovides a rich and diverse habitat for bacteria whichnumber roughly at 1,000 species from 19 phyla. Skin FunctionSkin performs the following functions: \u0081 Protection: an anatomical barrier from pathogens and damage between the internal and external environment in bodily defense; Langerhans cells inthe skin are part of the adaptive immune system. \u0081 Sensation: contains a variety of nerve endings that react to heat and cold, touch, pressure,vibration, and tissue injury; see somatosensorysystem and haptics. \u0081 Heat regulation: the skin contains a blood supply far greater than its requirements which allowsprecise control of energy loss by radiation,convection and conduction. Dilated vesselsincrease perfusion blood flow andconserve heat. \u0081 Control of evaporation: the skin provides a relatively dry and semi-impermeable barrier tofluid loss. Loss of this function contributes to themassive fluid loss found in burn victims. \u0081 Aesthetics and communication: others see our skin and can assess our mood, physical state andattractiveness.\u0081 Storage and synthesis: acts as a storage center for lipids and water, as well as a means of synthesis of vitamin D by action of UV on certainparts of the skin. \u0081 Excretion: sweat contains urea, however its concentration is 1/130th that of urine, henceexcretion by sweating is at most a secondaryfunction to temperature regulation (Recent studiesanalyzing the chemical composition of sweatfound that the sweat of participants using \"thebox of hot rocks sauna\" had 95-97 percentwater, while the sweat of those using an infraredsauna was 80-85 percent water - the rest beingcomposed of cholesterol, fat-soluble toxins, heavymetals (such as mercury and cadmium), sulfuricacid, ammonia, sodium and uric acid - SeeBeyond Antibiotics, Drs. Michael A. Schmidt etal). From the same reference, \"Saunas are beingused by some doctors to stimulate the release oftoxins from the bodies of their patients. They havefound that a lower temperature (105-110Fahrenheit) sauna taken for a longer duration ismost beneficial. These low temperatures stimulatea fat sweat, which eliminates toxins stored in fat,as opposed to the high temperature sauna, whichencourages a water sweat.\" \u0081 Absorption: the cells comprising the outermost 0.25-0.40 mm of the skin are \"almostexclusively supplied by external oxygen\",although the \"contribution to total & (2002). The cutaneous uptake ofatmospheric oxygen contributes significantly tothe oxygen supply of human dermis andepidermis. PDF Journal of Physiology 538(3):985-994. doi:10.1113/jphysiol.2001.013067).This absorption and semi-permeability mechanismallows ozone to be absorbed into the body fromthe Photon Genie and Photon GeniusInstrumentation. In addition, medicine can beadministered through the skin, by ointments or bymeans of adhesive patch, such as the nicotinepatch or iontophoresis (transdermal applications ofmany kinds are now available). The skin is animportant site of transport in many other organisms. \u0081 Water resistance: The skin acts as a water resistant barrier so essential nutrients aren'twashed out of the body. 32 www.edskilling.comHUMAN SKINSECTION 5: DETOXIFICATIONPermeability of the Skin \u0081 Until recently, the human skin barrier was thought to preclude absorption through the skin of all but a few substances with unique properties(nicotiine, for example). \u0081 Human skin permeability has the ability for foreign substances to penetrate and diffuse through the skin.Skin naturally has a low permeability, thus protectsthe body from particles and foreign toxins by notallowing them to penetrate through the surface.However, technologies in nanomedicine andbiology have led to developments in techniques andto the discovery that skin permeability is increasedwith the use of electromagnetic stimulation and toincreased permeability of the skin in various otherapplications. The stratum corneum is the outermostlayer of skin and is an effective barrier to mostinorganic nanosized particles (See Baroli, B.Penetration of Nanoparticles Skin: Fiction or Reality? Journal ofPharmaceutical Sciences 2009 December;99:21-50 and P., Gomes, M., Alves, Carrier to ZnONanoparticle Percutaneous Absorption. SkinPharmacology and Physiology 2009;22:266-275). \u0081 Nanomedicine researchers are interested in nanoparticles that can penetrate the stratumcorneum and settle in the epidermis where cellsprimarily reproduce. If the nanoparticles aretargeted to surround cancer cells, they can beused to map where the cancer is located anddeliver therapeutic agents directly to the site. Inmany ways, allopathic medicine is beginning to\"catch-up\" to modern electro-medicine. Hygiene and Skin Care The skin supports its own ecosystems of micro-organisms, including yeasts and bacteria, which cannot be removedby any amount of cleaning. Estimates place the numberof individual bacteria on the surface of one square inch(6.5 square cm) of human skin at 50 million, though thisfigure varies greatly over the average 20 square feet (1.9m2) of human skin. Oily surfaces, such as the face, maycontain over 500 million bacteria per square inch (6.5cm\u00b2). Despite these vast quantities, all of the bacteriafound on the skin's surface would fit into a volume thesize of a pea. In general, the micro-organisms keep oneanother in check and are part of a healthy skin. When thebalance is disturbed, there may be an overgrowth andinfection, such as when antibiotics kill microbes, resultingin an overgrowth of yeast. The skin is continuous with the inner epithelial lining of the body at the orifices, each of which supports its owncomplement of microbes. Proper skin hygiene is importantbecause unclean skin favors the development of pathogenicorganisms. The dead cells that continually slough off theepidermis mix with the secretions of the sweat andsebaceous glands and the dust found on the skin form afilthy layer on its surface. If not washed away, the slurry ofsweat and sebaceous secretions mixed with dirt and deadskin is decomposed by bacterial flora, producing a foulsmell. Functions of the skin are disturbed when it isexcessively dirty; it becomes more easily damaged, therelease of antibacterial compounds decreases, and dirtyskin is more prone to develop infections. Cosmetics should be used carefully on the skin because these may cause allergic reactions. Each season requiressuitable clothing in order to facilitate the evaporation ofthe sweat. Sunlight, water and air play an important rolein keeping the skin healthy. ApplicationsA large area of interest in nanomedicine is the transdermal patch because of the possibility of a painlessapplication of therapeutic agents with very few sideeffects. Transdermal patches have been limited toadminister a small number of drugs, such as nicotine,because of the limitations in permeability of the skin.Development of techniques that increase skin permeabilityhas led to more drugs that can be applied via transdermalpatches and more options for patients. Increasing the permeability of skin allows nanoparticles to penetrate and target cancer cells. Nanoparticles alongwith multi-modal imaging techniques have been used asa way to diagnose cancer non-invasively. Skin with highpermeability allowed quantum dots with an antibodyattached to the surface for active targeting to successfullypenetrate and identify cancerous tumors in mice. Tumortargeting is beneficial because the particles can beexcited using fluorescence microscopy and emit lightenergy and Source: Wikipedia www.edskilling.com 33SECTION 5: DETOXIFICATIONIn Ozone or bio-oxidative therapy, pure ozone is introduced into the human body. Whereas oxygen is O2, ozone is O3. The introduction of ozone has been shown \u0081 to increase oxygen delivery to the tissues and organs of the body, \u0081 to increase blood circulation, to detoxify the body's systems, and \u0081 to boost the immune system. Once in the body, the hydrogen peroxide or ozone(theraputic ozone is reduced to hydrogen peroxide afterit enters the body) breaks down into various oxygensubspecies which contact anaerobic viruses andmicrobes. It also stimulates the production of white bloodcells, which are necessary to fight infection. Ozone hasanti-bacterial, anti-fungus and anti-viral properties. Itincreases oxygen and hemoglobin disassociation, thusincreasing the delivery of oxygen from the blood to thecells. Ozone has a detoxifying effect on our body. Itaccelerates the citric acid cycle, which is the main cyclefor the liberation of energy from sugars. This thenstimulates basic metabolism. Oxygen therapies increasetissue oxygenation, thus bringing about patientimprovement. It also has an anti-oxidant effect on ourbody by scavenging the free radicals present in our body. The Affect of Bio-oxidative Therapy on the Human Body According to Frank Shallenberger, M.D., who is best known in the United States for treating AIDS patients witha holistic protocol including ozone, two books, \"Burstingwith Energy\" and \"The Type 2 Diabetes Breakthrough\",and his seminars on \"The Applications of Ozone inMedicine,\" bio-oxidative therapies affect the human bodyin the following ways: \u0081 They stimulate the production of white blood cells, which are necessary to fight infection. \u0081 Ozone and hydrogen peroxide are anti-virucidal.\u0081 They increase oxygen and hemoglobin disassociation, thus increasing the delivery ofoxygen from the blood to the cells. \u0081 Ozone and hydrogen peroxide are anti- neoplastic, which means that they inhibit thegrowth of new tissues like tumors.\u0081 They oxidize and degrade petrochemicals.\u0081 They increase red blood cell membrane distensibility, thus enhancing their flexibility andeffectiveness. \u0081 Bio-oxidative therapies increase the production of interferon and Tumor Necrosis Factor, whichthe body uses to fight infections and cancers. \u0081 They increase the efficiency of the anti-oxidant enzyme system, which scavenges excess freeradicals in the body. \u0081 They accelerate the Citric Acid Cycle, which is the main cycle for the liberation of energy fromsugars. This then stimulates basic metabolism. Italso breaks down proteins, carbohydrates andfats to be used as energy. \u0081 Bio-oxidative therapies increase tissue oxygenation, thus bringing about patientimprovement. How is Bio-oxidative Therapy Used? Ozone (O 3) is an energized form of oxygen with extra electrons. It forms the protective ozone layer around the planet, yet becomes a pollutant when mixed withhydrocarbons (like carbon dioxide) and nitrogen oxidefrom automobile and factory emissions. Because scientistshave focussed on the negative effects of inhaled ozone,the medicinal aspects of the gas when appliedintravenously or through the skin have been largelyoverlooked. Because ozone was found to be an effectivebactericide and fungicide during the mid-1800's, it wasfirst used to purify drinking water in a number ofEuropean cities. Today, over 2,000 municipalities aroundthe world- including Montreal, Paris, Los Angeles andMoscow- purify their drinking water with ozone. However, ozone was not used medically until 1915, when it was found to be an effective disinfectant ofwounds and skin diseases in Germany during the FirstWorld War. It was later found that ozone has the abilityto \"blast\" holes through the membranes of viruses, yeasts,bacteria and abnormal tissue cells thereby killing them.Ozone was the focus of considerable research inGermany during the 1930's where it was successfullyused to treat patients suffering from inflammatory boweldisorders, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and chronicbacterial diarrhea. 34 www.edskilling.comOZONE, HYDROGEN PEROXIDE AND BIO-OXIDATIVE THERAPYSECTION 5: DETOXIFICATIONSince that time, ozone and hydrogen peroxide have been studied in major medical research centers throughout theworld, including Baylor University, Yale University, TheUniversity of California (Los Angeles) and HarvardUniversity in the United States, as well as in medicalschools and laboratories in Great Britain, Germany, Italy,Russia, Canada, Japan and Cuba. Today, between fiftyand one hundred scientific articles are published eachmonth about the chemical and beneficial biologicaleffects of ozone and hydrogen peroxide. The Theory and Science Behind Bio-Oxidative Therapy The science and therapeutical treatment behind bio- oxidative therapies is based on the theory that theaccumulation of toxins and pathogens in the body isnormally burnt up by the process of oxidation, a processwherein a substance is changed chemically because ofthe effect of oxygen on it. Oxidation breaks the toxinsdown into carbon dioxide and water, and eliminates themfrom the body. However, if the oxygen system of the bodyis weak or deficient (whether through lack of exercise,environmental pollution, poor diet, smoking, or improperbreathing), our bodies cannot eliminate them adequatelyand a toxic reaction can occur. In minor cases, a toxicbuildup can lead to fatigue, while a wide range ofdiseases can result when poor oxygenation is chronic.

Administering Ozone Therapy The Photon Genie, and the Photon Genius produce ozonewith their plasma tubes filled with ionized Noble Gases.The ionized noble gases not only produce bio-photonicenergy, as discussed previously, but at the instant theymake contact with the body's skin, they produce ozone,which the body absorbs through the skin. This techniqueand these instruments are often referred to as cold plasma.Cold plasma generators were invented by Nikola Tesla inthe 1920's, and the technology is still in use today. The ozone is absorbed through the skin and into the body in a process known as transdermal or topical skinabsorption. Studies now show that oxygen and ozone areabsorbed directly through the skin and that this accountsfor about 1% of the body's oxygen. While the FDAmaintains that ozone is a toxic chemical, studies andactual clinical use in Europe and Asia over the past onehundred years and longer demonstrate the amazingbenefits of ozone therapy as a safe procedure. Benefits of Ozone TherapyIn addition to the outstanding detoxification results obtained with ozone therapy, and according to theInternational Bio-Oxidative Medical Foundation (IBOMF),a U.S.-based organization devoted to research andeducation about these therapies, the following benefitshave been researched by practitioners and observed bypatients alike from around the world. Bio-oxidativetherapy: \u0081 helps relax and loosen muscles by reducing the buildup of lactic acid. \u0081 helps to oxidize toxins so they can be eliminated through major organs. It helps in increasingblood circulation, which helps injured musclesrepair quicker. \u0081 may stimulate vasodilatation of peripheral blood vessels for pain relief. \u0081 may speed up the metabolic processes of the organs and endocrine glands. \u0081 promotes cleaner, softer and rejuvenated skin. \u0081 may normalize cell respiration.\u0081 may help with chronic fatigue and environmental illness. \u0081 may stimulate the immune system.\u0081 may reduce carbon monoxide poisoning.\u0081 may increase in available oxygen, assisting the body's natural detoxifying process. 38 www.edskilling.comSECTION 5: DETOXIFICATIONThe circulatory system is an organ system that passes nutrients (such as amino acids, electrolytes and lymph),gases, hormones, blood cells, etc. to and from cells in thebody to help fight diseases, stabilize body temperatureand pH, and to maintain homeostasis. This system may be seen strictly as a blood distribution network, but some consider the circulatory system ascomposed of the cardiovascular system, which distributesblood, and the lymphatic system, which distributes lymph.While humans, as well as other vertebrates, have aclosed cardiovascular system (meaning that the bloodnever leaves the network of arteries, veins andcapillaries), some invertebrate groups have an opencardiovascular system. The most primitive animal phylalack circulatory systems. The lymphatic system, on theother hand, is an open system. Two types of fluids move through the circulatory system: blood and lymph. The blood, heart, and blood vesselsform the cardiovascular system. The lymph, lymph nodes,and lymph vessels form the lymphatic system. Thecardiovascular system and the lymphatic systemcollectively make up the circulatory system. The Role of the Circulatory System in Body Defense Diseases are caused by the presence of bacteria, fungi or viruses in the body. The symptoms may be due to theantigen or foreign proteins of the bacteria or the toxicchemicals produced by the bacteria. Recovery from thedisease followed by immunity depends mainly on theproduction of antibodies in the blood. Antibodies areproteins released into the blood that destroy, kill or eliminatethese disease-causing micro-organisms from the body. We are exposed to all types of disease-causing micro- organisms in our environment, and in the body. Therefore,we do need defense mechanisms for protection. Theblood cardiovascular systems as well as the lymphaticsystems, collectively, our circulatory systems, play a veryimportant role in the body defense mechanism. These pathogenic micro-organisms enter the body through the mouth, the nose or through open wounds. Eating anddrinking foods containing pathogens, or open woundsbeing exposed to the air are all sources by which themicro-organisms gain entry onto our bodies. The body'sdefense against the entry of pathogens and diseases canbe divided into three lines of defense. The Body's First Line of Defense - the Skin and Mucous Membranes The Skin \u0081 The skin is a hard keratinized (a protein) outer layer. It serves as an effective barrier to microorganisms \u0081 The pH value of the skin is low (pH 3-5) thus making it acidic and unsuitable for mostmicroorganisms \u0081 Besides the presence of the enzyme lysozyme which destroys or kills pathogens in the sweatand sebum helps the skin to ward off harmfulmicro-organisms \u0081 The clotting mechanism plays an important role in preventing the pathogenic micro-organisms fromgaining entry into body through wounds in theskin. The Mucous Membranes \u0081 The mucous membrane as well as the cilia lining the trachea and bronchi prevents the entry ofmicro-organisms via the respiratory tract \u0081 Micro-organisms, dust particles spores and the like get caught up in mucous secreted bynumerous goblets cells and is carried by thebeating cilia towards the glottis. Laughing,sneezing or vomiting aid in eliminating theseforeign substances \u0081 Besides these mechanisms, the hydrochloric acid in the stomach kill any bacteria that come intocontact with the food. The Body's Second Line of Defense - The White Blood Cells Phagocytic White Blood Cells \u0081 Phagocytos is the process of engulfing solid particles by the cell membranes and is the immune system's primary method used to removepathogens, like bacteria, from the body.Phagocytosis is used by the immune system withdead cells, small mineral particles, bacteria,pathogens, and even nutrients. www.edskilling.com 39THE CARDIOVASCULAR/CIRCULATORY SYSTEMSECTION 5: DETOXIFICATION\u0081 The bacteria are a vesicle, (ingested) and digested by enzyme secreted lysosome and discharges the enzyme that digests the food. Thebacteria and the end products are absorbed intothe cytoplasm. The Body's Third Line of Defense - The Antibody - the Immune Response The Immune Response \u0081 This line of defense acts specially and involves the lymphocytes. Immunity is the ability of the body to fight diseases caused by pathogens \u0081 Foreign proteins found in bacteria and viruses stimulate the immune response from thelymphocytes. These foreign proteins are referredto as antigens. An antigen stimulates theproduction of a corresponding protein called anantibody. \u0081 The antibody combines with the antigen, neutralizes the antigen or destroys them invarious ways o Certain antibodies cause the antigen/ micro- organisms to clump together making themineffective in their action. This is referred toas agglutination o Some antibodies dissolve the outer membrane or coat of micro-organismscausing them to disintegrate. This action isreferred to as lysis o Opsonin is yet another type of antibody which adheres to the outer surface of themicro-organisms, \"marking\" them, which arethen engulfed and ingested by phagocytes o Antitoxins neutralize the toxin released by pathogenic micro-organisms. \u0081 The antibody - antigen reaction is specific. The production of antibodies in response to antigenis referred to as the immune response. Thelymphocytes are the white blood cells thatproduce the antibodies. They are manufacturedin the lymph nodes \u0081 Lymphocytes' reaction to antigen involves the production of antibodies that are specific to theantigen.Immunity and Immunization Immunity is the body's ability to fight the disease caused by the pathogens. The presence of antibodies in aperson's blood confers him or her immunity againstspecific diseases. When a person recovers from thedisease the antibodies may remain in the blood streambriefly. However, the ability to produce these antibodiesin another invasion by the same bacteria or virus preventshim or her from contracting the same disease. The personis said to be immune to the disease. Immunity can be acquired naturally from birth or after recovering from a disease like measles or chicken pox.Immunity can be induced in a person by vaccination orinoculation. Vaccine is a suspension of dead bacteria orinactivated viruses. When these are injected into theblood of a person his or her body is stimulated to produceantibodies to fight these injected bacteria or viruses. Thisprocess of injecting vaccine into a person is referred to asimmunization. Immunization, therefore, confers artificialimmunity. Active immunity is the kind of immunity where the body makes its own antibodies in response to an antigen(pathogenic micro-organisms, bacteria or viruses). \u0081 Active natural immunity is the kind of immunity acquired by a person who has recovered from adisease. For example if a person contractsmeasles and recovers from it, his body wouldhave actively produced antibodies specific tofight the measles antigen, in this case the measlesvirus. These antibodies may remain only for ashort time but the ability to produce theseantibodies by the body is greatly increased.Thus, the person is protected from further invasionby the measles virus. \u0081 Active artificial immunity can be acquired by injecting antigen (dead, inactive bacteria orviruses), the vaccine into the body. This willinduce the production of the appropriateantibodies. If and when the particular micro-organisms enter the body, these antibodiesactively fight the disease causing micro-organisms eliminating them. Immunization byvaccination has been able to protect the peoplefrom such disease as tetanus, diphtheria,poliomyelitis and others. 40 www.edskilling.comSECTION 5: DETOXIFICATIONPassive Immunity - is one where a person receives antibodies into his body from external sources and notby actively producing them in his body. \u0081 Passive natural immunity is one which all of us posses from birth. The antibodies move acrossthe placenta from the mother to the foetus. Thisconfers passive but natural immunity on theyoung be it humans or other mammals. \u0081 Passive artificial immunity - this involves the injection of anti-serum containing specificantibodies to ward off a specific disease into arecipient from another individual or an animallike the horse. The diphtheria antibodies areprepared by injecting toxin obtained from thediphtheria bacillus into a horse. The toxin is firstmade harmless before injecting into the horse.The horse responds by producing antibodies inlarge amounts. The horse serum is then injectedinto a person to enable him or her to acquirepassive but artificial immunity against diphtheria.The same technique is used to protect anindividual who is already suffering from tetanusby injecting serum containing antibodies to fightthe tetanus bacteria. The Effects of HIV on the Body's Immune System HIV refers to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus. This virus causes AIDS or the Acquired Immune DeficiencySyndrome. The HIV acts by paralyzing the human immunesystem to such an extent that the victim is unable to fightthe bacteria, yeast and viral infection that a normalhealthy person can easily overcome. The humanimmunodeficiency virus attacks and kills the crucialimmune cells called T cells. These T cells and thelymphocytes are disabled and killed during the course ofinfection. They play an important role in the immuneresponse. A healthy uninfected person usually has 800 to 1200 T cells per cubic millimeter of blood. In the blood of an HIVinfected person this number declines rapidly. If these cellsfall below 200/mm\u00b3 the victim will become prone toinfections and cancers. This indicates that the patient hasAIDS which is the end stage of HIV disease. AIDS victimsvery often suffer infection of the lungs, intestinal tract,brain, eyes, skin and other organs. They also suffer\"extreme\" weight loss, diarrhea, and skin cancer,sarcomas and lymphomas. Thus HIV causes death bykilling the lymphocytes (CD + T cells), interfering, withtheir normal function and weakening a person's immunesystem. Transmission of HIVThe HIV virus can be transmitted from an infected person to a healthy person via the seminal fluid, vaginal fluid,blood as well as mother's blood. Transmission of HIV canoccur through the following ways: \u0081 having sexual relationship with a HIV carrier \u0081 sharing needles with HIV infected drug addicts \u0081 during blood transmission between an HIV infected mother to her unborn child in the wombor via mother's milk fed to her baby. The Photon Genie/Genius and theCardiovascular System The Ozone produced and introduced to the body by the Skilling Instruments causes the de-vitalization of thepleomorphic pathogen. Pleomorphic means that thepathogen can appear as a bacteria, a virus, a fungi orother form, though the pathogen may be the same, onlyin an altered form. Science is coming to the conclusionthat major illnesses, such as cancer, may be caused bypathogens, for the most part, and any technology thatdestroys, rids or devitalizes pathogens will have a verypositive affect on health. Additionally, the frequencyharmonics of the Skilling Instruments have been shown toimprove the strength of healthy cell membranes,preventing pathogen invasion in the first place. Most pathogens simply cannot survive the presence of bio-oxidative agents such as ozone or hydrogenperoxide. Finally, the stimulation of the lymphatic andcirculatory systems and subsequent elimination in the skinis a major development in science and strongly suggeststhat detoxification is a viable practice, and one that hasbeen used successfully in Asia and elsewhere for severalthousand years. Source: Wikipedia www.edskilling.com 41SECTION 5: DETOXIFICATIONWhat is Infrared Sauna Technology? Sunlight is a combination of visible light and invisible light. The seven colors of the rainbow are visible lights,and infrared rays and ultraviolet rays are \"invisible\"lights. Infrared rays are one of the sun's rays. Infraredrays are the healthiest, penetrate deeply into the skin andthey dissolve harmful substances accumulated in the body.The Infrared Rays vitalize your cells and metabolism. Infrared waves penetrate deep into the body for a deep heating action that allows for the body to activate thesweat glands. The sweat glands offer one of only a fewmechanisms that the body has to eliminate toxins andsince the skin is the largest organ in the human body it isa very good means for elimination. As discussedpreviously, the other body mechanisms include the lungs,liver, kidneys, colon, lymphatic system and blood. When Infrared waves are applied to water molecules (comprising 70% of our body) these molecules begin tovibrate. This vibration reduces the ion bonds and theeventual breakdown of the water molecules causesencapsulated gases and other toxic materials to be released. The sun is the primary source of radiant energy, but not all of this energy is beneficial. Although life needs energy fromthe sun, too much sunlight damages the skin. Infrared heatprovides all the healthy benefits of natural sunlight withoutany of the dangerous effects of solar radiation. For years, the healthcare industry recommended infrared heat lamps as a source of Infrared heat but the lampswere cumbersome, extremely hot and difficult to maintainat a constant temperature. Today, many healthcareprofessionals use Infrared heaters to treat a variety ofdiseases throughout the world. The efficacy of Infrared waves is very broad and the subject of recent study by NASA. Among the infraredwaves, the Infrared rays, which have a wavelength of 8-14 microns, are especially good for the human body.These waves have the potential to penetrate 1.5 to 3inches or more into the body allowing for deep heat andraising the core body temperature from deep inside. Thedeep heat and Infrared is why scholars believe that theOndol (traditional warm floor of Korea) is good for healthbecause the materials for the Ondol are stone and earthboth of which radiate Infrared waves when heated. The Infrared rays consist of similar wavelengths as that which is emitted naturally by the human body. This is onepotential explanation of why many feel energeticallyrejuvenated and balanced from contact with Infraredwaves. It has also been shown that Infrared waves helpimprove blood circulation and recovery from fatigue. Why Infrared Technology? Infrared energy penetrates the body's tissue. Tests have shown that the energy output is tuned so closely to thebody's own radiant energy that our bodies absorb asmuch as 93% of the Infrared waves that reach our skin. By comparison, conventional saunas must rely only on indirect means of heat: first, on convection (air currents)and then, conduction (direct contact of hot air with theskin) to produce its heating effect. Infrared Saunas arebest used at temperatures between 100 to 140F versus180 to 220F for traditional hot-air saunas. Why is Infrared Heat Better than Traditional Sauna? Infrared saunas use low-EMF heaters, which do not turn red hot, but instead produce invisible, Infrared heat. This is thesame type of heat as produced by the sun and our bodies.Infrared heat is very safe and not at all like the heatproduced by microwaves. In an infrared sauna, only 20percent of the energy is used to heat the air, leaving the restof the energy to heat the body. The radiant heat canpenetrate deep below the skin producing a gentle warminginside the body. The temperature inside an infrared saunais adjustable and averages a comfortable 100 \u00b0F to 140 \u00b0FThis targeted heat allows a person to sweat faster and totolerate a longer period of time inside the sauna, allowingfor the therapeutic effects to occur. Typical sessions last 20 42 www.edskilling.comINFRARED LIGHTSECTION 5: DETOXIFICATIONto 45 minutes and can be repeated once or twice during the day to maximize the benefits. Infrared saunas leave the userfeeling invigorated, not depleted like conventional saunas.Infrared heaters warm the body in the same manner asnatural sunlight. Infrared Heat therapy uses thewavelength of the visible and non-visible light spectrum ofsunlight that heats the body normally. Traditional saunasraise the temperature of the air to a very high level withinthe chamber to warm the body. Some people havedifficulty breathing in this extremely warm air. Infraredsaunas work differently. Instead of heating the air withinthe enclosure, Infrared saunas heat the body directly. Theresult is deeper tissue penetration. In the Infrared sauna,the body perspires and receives all of the healthy benefitsbut avoids the harmful and extremely hot air of atraditional steam sauna. Health Benefits of Infrared Sauna TechnologyInfrared Sauna technology is completely safe and produces the same Infrared heat produced by the sun.Far-infrared heat is required for all living things foroptimum health. The radiant heat from a Infrared saunasurrounds the user and penetrates deeply into their joints,muscles and tissues, speeding oxygen flow andincreasing circulation. Using Infrared Sauna helps toremove impurities from the body's cells, specifically thecells inside our fat where our body stores waste andharmful toxins such as cholesterol and heavy metals. Completely harmless, we feel Infrared heat from such sources as the sun (without the harmful ultraviolet wavesthat the sun gives off) and fires. Just as visible light has arange of wavelengths (running from red to violet), so doesinfrared light: longer wavelength infrared waves arethermal, while short or near infrared waves are not hot atall, in fact, you cannot even feel them. It is the Infraredenergy that is most beneficial, penetrating the skin andincreasing circulation to help rid the body of harmful toxins. Increase Metabolism, Burn Calories and Lose Weight As users relax in the gentle Infrared heat, the body is actually hard at work producing sweat, pumping blood,and burning calories. As the body increases sweatproduction to cool itself, the heart will work harder topump blood at a greater rate to boost circulation. Thisincrease in metabolism will burn calories. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, \"Many of us who run do so to place ademand on our cardiovascular system, not to build bigleg muscles. Regular use of a Sauna imparts a similarstress on the cardiovascular system, and its regular usemay be as effective a means of cardiovascularconditioning and burning of calories as regular exercise.\" Relieves Muscle PainThe deep heat of a Infrared sauna helps peripheral blood vessels dilate, bringing relief and healing to muscle andsoft tissue injuries. Increased blood circulation carries offmetabolic waste products and delivers oxygen-rich bloodto oxygen-depleted muscle, so they recover faster. Muscles relax most readily when tissues are warm, for greater flexibility and range of motion. Infrared heatrelieves muscle tension thereby helping the body to makethe most of its intended healing abilities. Infrared heatreduces soreness on nerve endings and muscle spasmsas muscle joints and fibers are heated. Improves the Immune SystemInfrared heaters raise the core body temperature, inducing an artificial fever. Fever is the body's naturalmechanism to strengthen and accelerate the immuneresponse, as seen in the case of infection. This enhancedimmune system, combined with improved elimination oftoxins and wastes via intense sweating, increases theoverall health and resistance to disease. Removes ToxinsInfrared Sauna heat increases the blood circulation and stimulates the sweat glands, releasing built up toxins in thebody. Daily sauna sweating can help detoxify the body asit rids itself of accumulated highly toxic metals (lead,mercury, nickel, and cadmium) as well as alcohol, nicotine, www.edskilling.com 43SECTION 5: DETOXIFICATIONsulfuric acid, and other organic and inorganic compounds. \"Traditional wisdom has suggested that saunas worklargely by promoting detoxification through the sweat...Saunas also stimulate cells to release toxins that can thenbe eliminated by the liver andbowel. Several published studieshave now shown that this thermo-therapy can bring about the rapidremoval of a wide range of toxicsubstances from the human body.\"John C. Cline, Island, BritishColumbia, Canada. \"The best way to get rid of heavy metals and pesticide residues? Theinfrared sauna. It has been knownfor decades that sweating is awonderful way to get rid of storedchemicals, including heavy metals.In fact, sauna is one of thedetoxification procedures used inthe Environmental Units in Dallas(Dr. William Rea) and NorthCharleston (Dr. Allan Lieberman) where the sickest of folksgo to heal. But many people, myself included, never couldtolerate a sauna. We felt weak, sick, fast heart rate, faint,dizzy, headachy, or just miserable. Thanks to improvedtechnology, the infrared sauna is tolerated much better,because it uses a heat energy that penetrates the tissuesbetter, allowing an overall lower temperature to be used.\" Dr. Sherry Rogers, Total Wellness, May 2000. Improves Skin The profuse sweating achieved after just a few minutes in aninfrared sauna carries off deeplyimbedded impurities and dead skincells, leaving the skin glowing andimmaculately clean. Increasedcirculation draws the skin's ownnatural nutrients to the surface. The body experiences improved tone, elasticity, texture and freshcolor. Increased blood circulationhas also been shown to relieve acne,eczema, psoriasis, burns, lesionsand cuts. In addition, open woundsheal more quickly, reducing scarring. There is substantial evidence for theproduction of Nitric Oxide in bodywith the use of Infrared Therapy.The Nobel Prize in Medicine in1998 was awarded to Murad,Furchgott & Ignaro who found that nitric oxide gas, which is produced, by Infrared, is usedby white cells to defend against tumors and allowshealing to take place. 44 www.edskilling.com\"Shocking statistics reveal that in North America alone there are over 77,000 chemicals being produced. 3,000 of them have been added to our food supply and 20,000 of them cannot be metabolized properly by our bodies.\" Dr. George Yu, MDSECTION 5: DETOXIFICATIONDr. Valentino Fuster, past president of the American Heart Association, called the nitric oxide discovery \"one of themost important discoveries in the history of cardiovascularmedicine because it promotes expansion of the capillariesand allows blood to increase circulation in the affected areaand to then reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Dr. Lon R. Horwitz reports in Augmentation of Wound Healing Using Monochromatic Infrared Energy; Advancesin Wound author's unpublished research, energy modality increases nitric acid in the bloodand plasma of normal adult subjects. A 1999 publicationby Dr. Horwitz strongly suggests that Infrared producesnitric oxide gas, which aided in the recovery of the fivepatients in a study, who could not get healingconventionally. They had various diabetic problems andwere not able to heal, but they received the nitric oxidetechnology produced by the Infrared, and healing tookplace for all of them. When you apply Infrared technology, these researchers report seeing healing results from the production of nitricoxide by the hemoglobin due to the reaction of thephotons of the Infrared on the enzymes, which producesthe nitric oxide gas. The immune cells get into the areaand the circulation is increased. Pain is reduced, and thearea then is reported to have the immune cells necessaryto get complete healing. The wide-ranging results of nitric oxide may pay off in new treatments for: \u0081 Atherosclerosis (a thickening of artery walls); \u0081 Septic shock (a dangerous drop in blood pressure); \u0081 Cancer. The Infrared protocol has been instituted after conventional management protocols were shown to beineffective in wound healing. The rate and quality ofhealing of these previously refractory wounds, followinguse of Infrared energy, may be related to local increasesin nitric oxide concentration. Increases in nitric oxidepreviously have been demonstrated to correlate withvasodilatory and anabolic responses.Additional research has suggested that FAR Infrared heat produces therapeutic effects in the following: \u0081 Brain - Short-term memory reportedly improved/accelerated repair in brain contusions;Cerebral hemorrhages healing with Infrared bothspeeds up and is significantly enhanced. \u0081 Collagen Tissues - Helps Ligaments /Joint capsules /Tendons; In Fascia Synovium, Infraredallegedly increases range of motion; Infraredreportedly can assist in treatment of scarred,thickened or contracted tissues; Can increaseextensibility of collagen tissues. \u0081 Body Tissues - Reduces acidity in the body (Infrared causes fruit to ripen faster by reducing acidity). \u0081 Nerves - Neurasthenia -Infrared reportedly adjusts autonomic nerve function; Reportedly Infraredreduces over-stimulation of sensory nerves. \u0081 Cells - Infrared attracts calcium ions to the cellular level; Infrared promotes adhesion and osmosisof water molecules across the cellular membrane;Infrared stimulates enzyme activity. \u0081 Joints - Supposedly assists in reduction of swelling and inflammation by improving lymph flow;Purportedly decreases joint stiffness directly. \u0081 Pain Relief - Infrared reportedly reduces neuralgia headache pain during menstruation; May leadto increased endorphin production, whichreduces pain. \u0081 Conditions Affected by Circulation - Reportedly increases blood flow by promoting dilation ofcapillaries; Reportedly reduces clogged capillaryvessels in hypertension arteriosclerosis;Reportedly affects high blood pressure/lowblood pressure in coronary artery disease; Canreportedly reduce arthritis sciatica backaches;Can be positive in treating hemorrhoids/nervoustension/diabetes; May be symptoms ofpiles/poor peripheral circulation. \u0081 Cardiovascular - Fir may be effective in treating atherosclerosis (thickening of artery walls due tofatty deposits) May assist with septic shock(dangerous drop of blood pressure) www.edskilling.com 45INFRARED AND NITRIC OXIDESECTION 5: DETOXIFICATION\u0081 Research by NASA in the early 1980 s led to the conclusion that infrared stimulation of cardiovascular function would be the ideal way tomaintain cardiovascular conditioning in Americanastronauts during long space flights. As the bodyworks to cool itself, there is a substantial increasein heart rate, cardiac output and metabolic rate,and blood flow rises. \u0081 Inflammatory infiltrates, edema, and - Reportedly joints/tendonitis Can positivelyinfluence sprain occlusivedisease; Can reduce the symptoms of gout; Canreportedly speed up healing / Reports of treatmentwith infrared have been so successful that hospitalstays were reported to have been reduced by 25%. \u0081 Cancer - Infrared has possible efficacy in cancer therapy/cancer of the tongue Infrared may assistin treating radiation sickness/seems to relievesigns & symptoms; Suggested efficacy in treatingcancer pain/paid reportedly relieved in laterstages of cancer; Infrared heat can penetratethrough the body and will reportedly killcancerous cells (Cancerous cells cannot exist ifblood circulation is smooth. Good circulation inthe capillaries leave no room for a cancerous cellto settle down. (A cancerous cell has to settledown so it can proliferate.) Infrared helpscapillaries to expand, improving circulation. Thecancer cell also has a weakness: heat above 42deg C can kill it. Infrared heat can reportedlypenetrate through the body and kill cancerouscells. Infrared treatment raises body temperature.Infrared therapy can reportedly alleviate painand prolong life when conventional cancertreatment fails. Surgery, radiotherapy andchemotherapy are considered detrimental tohealth, since they are invasive treatments.Infrared therapy and immuno-therapy arecurrently regarded as non-invasive. Infrared maybe very beneficial).\u0081 Dentistry - Dr. John Tate, DDS, is quoted as saying; \"I have used the Infrared with over fifty high risk surgical cases without complication ordry sockets on 92% of the patient. They get whatwe call complete healing. The macrophagesproduce collagen necessary to stimulate thefibroblasts, and the tissue of the fibroblasts thenwill stimulate the osteoblast-which is bone. That iswhere the bone forms and it starts in the first threedays - but it takes about six months for completehealing. The two main cells we need in dentistryand in surgery around the bone area are themacrophages and the neutrophils\" (which areactivated by Infrared heat). \"The iscalled the \"pac man\" of the immune system. Themacrophage is a cell that engulfs and digestsmicroorganisms. Everything starts with themacrophage - \"macro\" meaning big and\"phage\" meaning eater. So we have a big eaterhere. The tentacle on the macrophage grabs thestaphylococci and a bacillus rod, and thatmacrophage extends a pseudo paw to get thebacteria that is now invading our blood!\" \u0081 Immune System - Infrared may assist in pelvic infection/post-surgical infection; Infrared may bean efficacious treatment in toe-and-finger-nailfungus; There is an immune response facilitatedby the photons of the Infrared technology thatturns on the enzyme system, particularly the nitricoxide synthase enzyme. More white blood cellsmeans greater immune function and resistance todisease and viruses. It is well establishedmedically that this is the mechanism involved inthe Infrared technology. One autoimmunedisease which may be assisted by Infrared isScleraderma (an autoimmune disease wherecollagen builds up and healing cannot take placebecause the circulation can't get to the area dueto the buildup of the collagen). We can easily add several more pages of Infrared and Nitric Oxide benefits and suggesthttp://www.biofircenter.com/info/far-infrared-technology-research-fir-from-all-around-the-world foradditional information on the subject. 46 www.edskilling.comSECTION 6: FITNESS AND APPEARANCEThe health benefits of the infrared saunas, historically, are well documented to relieve pain, increase circulation, providealternative medicine healing and detoxification, and with areturn to health and vitality, a return to improved fitness andappearance can also occur. The Photon Genius is the most advanced sauna in history. As discussed previously, there are \"noticeable\" positive affectsof heat, light, harmonic energy transmission and particularlywith the first and only \"controlled\" near and far infraredsauna ever, there are \"noticeable\"changes in appearance and weight. With the Photon Genius, you will sweat a lot when you are in this newEnergy Sauna. Cells are movingaround, heat is produced, energy isreceived, the circulation is improvingand changes in appearance withweight loss is the result. In fact,depending on usage (length of timeand number of sessions), a singlesession can \"burn\" from 300 to 700calories, the equivalent of a six milerun, 30 minutes of rowing, or severalhours in a gym. In addition to weight loss, you are sweating out toxins that your body has been storing up all of your life. You willstart to see and feel an improvement not only in yourweight management, but also in your overall health andappearance. Many women notice other wonderful benefits in addition to weight management. Some of them will be relieved ofpainful menstrual cramps as well. This is because the bloodis circulating better and reaching all of the muscles andorgans. The Photon Genius empowers the body to workmore efficiently and effectively, and the result is a dynamicreduction in multiple stresses in the body which translates tofeeling and looking better.Cellulite Reduction Almost all women have cellulite. Cellulite is the body's natural way of storing fat in post-adolescent women toensure that the body has enough calories available forpregnancy and lactation. There are a number of well-known issues promote creation of cellulite \u0081 smoking\u0081 alcohol\u0081 tight garments\u0081 genetic and hormonal factors\u0081 poor blood circulation\u0081 toxic exposures Stimulating blood circulation is a very effective way to reduce cellulitein the body. You can increase bloodcirculation with: \u0081 regular exercise \u0081 skin dry-brushing\u0081 massage therapy\u0081 infrared sauna therapy The Photon Genius is extremely effective at stimulating bloodcirculation. Energy Infrared rays penetrate the body up tothree inches, heating up body tissues and internal organs.This heat causes increased sweat gland activity anddilatation in capillaries, promoting improved bloodcirculation and toxic elimination. The Energy Infrared waves are a natural cellulite remedy. Fat liquefies at 110\u00b0F or 43\u00baC. This Energy Heat therapyliquefies the cellulite/fat stored deep in the body. Thecellulite/fat is then released into the blood stream orremoved from the body via sweat and the eliminativeorgans. The end result is skin that is more youthful, beautifuland smooth. www.edskilling.com 47Section 6: Fitness and Appearance WEIGHT LOSS You will start to see and feel an improvement not only in your weight management, but also in your overall health and appearance. SECTION 6: FITNESS AND APPEARANCEPsoriasis, eczema, acne are three very common skin disorders that tend to cause hardship for millions of people.These skin conditions affect the individual on many physicaland emotional levels including physical pain andaggrevation accompanied by lowered self-esteem,nervousness, and continual stress with a tendancy to resultin a feeling of embarrassment. The Photon Genius has been shown to help reduce and promote healing of the skin lesions involved in manyconditions in several different ways. With the Photon Genius,the \"controlled\" Infrared wavespenetrate deep into your skin and upto three inches into the tissues. Thisincreases blood circulation(vascularity) to your skin cells byincreasing the formation of newcapillaries and disinfecting everycapillary of your blood and replacedamaged cells. This new bloodsupply carries an increased oxygensupply to the cells that allows anincrease in transportation of freshnutrients into the damaged skinareas promoting healing, and a rushof waste products out of the tissuesthrough the skin so the cells can beimproved and function better. This \"noticeably\" inproves thetone, condition, and appearance of the skin. (ATP)The Photon Genius also activates \"ATP\" (Adenosine Triphosphate) the skin cells. ATP is the major carrier ofenergy to all cells. These increased levels of ATP will allowthe skin cells to accept nutrients faster and dump wasteproducts more readily. This causes a deep cleansing of yourskin cells causing them to be renewed faster, healthier, andin better condition. ATP is also great for helping the cellprocesses kill the bacteria, germs, and infections that causeskin inflammation. Other effects of the Photon Genius includes the purging of clogged pores, the release of deeply embedded impurities,the removal of dead skin cells and especially for acnesufferers, the shrinking of the sebaceous glands. Leadingresearch in the areas of psoriasis, eczema and acne relatemany health issues as the cause of these skin disorders.These are mainly stress, a decreased immune system andbeing toxic. Thankfully the Photon Genius sessions canimprove them all. Immune ResponseBesides affecting the skin cells directly as discussed above, the Energy Infrared from the Photon Genius elicits an increase in the body's immuneresponse by heating it up andcreating an artificial fever, which inturn will promote a natural healingresponse thus slowing down viraland fungal and bacterial growth.Now your immune system canfunction better to heal the skin. Fordetoxification, because the energyinfrared waves penetrate so deeplythrough our skin into tissues, as thebody heats up, they open the poresof our skin at their base so toxins arereleased with the sweat. This includes heavy metals, fat-soluble toxins, sulphuric acid, plastics, andmuch more. As we detoxify, the functioning of every systemin our body improves including skin formation,cleansing,elasticity and appearance. The Photon Genius helps to greatly reduce your stress by providing you with a new experience of relaxation, warmthand healing. Imagine, your skin looking healthier, moreradiant and you feeling better in so many ways at the sametime. Ever since the beginning of time we have searched forthe fountain of youth. As we age, certain components of ourskin begin to breakdown and degenerate setting the stagefor the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, furrows, folds,and sagging skin. The two main offenders are collagen andelastin. When they are in great supply they give our skin itshealthy tone and firmness. The Photon Genius increases thequality and quantity of both, while increasing and improvingthe quality and appearance of the skin. 48 www.edskilling.comSKIN AND SKIN DISORDERS The Photon Genius also activates \"ATP\" (Adenosine Triphosphate) in the skin cells. ATP is the major carrier of energy to all cells.SECTION 6: FITNESS AND APPEARANCEAging According to reseach performed by the American Academy of Dermatology, they state that as skin cells age, they beginto produce an increased amount of unstable oxygenmolecules otherwise known as free radicals. These freeradicals attack and damage the healthy cell membranes,proteins and DNA. Normally in younger people the skincells can produce their own antioxidants to combat thedamaging free radicals but in older skin cells unfortunatelywe lose that ability with increased toxic exposures, insults tothe body, and time. Collagen is a protein in our skin cells that is responsible for giving our skinits youthful tautness and suppleness.It has a high degree of elasticity.Collagen is the essential protein thatis used by the cells to repairdamaged tissue and to replace oldtissue. As we age, this is one of theskin cells' proteins that are attackedby the increased amounts of freeradicals and toxins. This causes thecollagen fibers to become inflexibleinstead of being able to slide andflex thus our skin begins todegenerate and look older. Photon Genius sessions can have amazing affects on aging skin in somany ways. The Photon Geniuspromotes increased circulation to theskin cells by generating new capillaries. This increasedblood supply carries more oxygen and nutrients to the cellsand carrys away toxins and waste products. This allows thecells to function at a more optimal level and therefore flushesout the free radicals that are damaging the collagen. The Photon Genius actually stimulates the production of collagen that will help the skin to retain its elasticity. It alsohelps stimulate the production of cells called fibroblasts.Fibroblasts are a type of cell that works to constantlyreplenish the skins production of collagen and elastin.Besides directly affecting the skin cells, The Photon Geniusworks through several other avenues to assist in slowingdown the aging process. It stimulates and helps to developa stronger immune system, it provides a full bodydetoxification and it promotes relaxation and comfort thusreducing stress which is noticeable in appearance. What could be better than a healthy, non-invasive therapy that could give you firmer skin, smoothing of wrinkles, anda decrease in blemishes and sun damage spots? Billions ofdollars are spent every year on cosmetic surgery in a quest to improve appearance and lookyounger. Most people don'tunderstand that youth, vitality andlongevity come from the inside of thebody. Most people are also unawarethe body's natural decrease in youthand vitality starts approximatelyaround the age of 25. Starting at thatage we can see the start ofmeasurable decrease in hormones,enzymes and neurological function;if you then have an unhealthy lifestyle you are further accelerating theaging process. To slow the agingprocess we should first adopt ahealthy life style, eat natural healthygood nutritional food, drink goodwater, exercise regularly, reducetoxic exposures, get a good night'ssleep and decrease stress levels.Unfortunately that will still not beenough to slow aging without help, so in addition to a healthy life style we need to do things thatwill help to increase hormones, enzymes and neurologicalfunction. Homeostasis - The Body Is Designed To Heal ItselfWhen you read any book on the science of physiology it will tell you that the body is always seeking a state ofhomeostasis. Homeostasis is the ideal state where the bodyis the healthiest. The science and philosophy of naturalmedicine studies demonstrates how the body heals itself www.edskilling.com 49The Photon Genius promotes increased circulation to the skin cells by generating new capillaries. This increased blood supply carries more oxygen and nutrients to the cells and carrys away toxins and waste products.SECTION 6: FITNESS AND APPEARANCEnaturally and then helps to support this healing process when needed. The body is born with the innate ability toheal itself naturally and prevent disease when it is in a stateof homeostasis. The body has an immune system, acirculatory system; it regulates body temperature, it regulatesinternal body biochemistry (homeostasis) and it can healand regenerate damaged cells or tissues. Exciting newresearch from Europe and Asia hasfound a new way to help slow theaging process. One of the most effectmethods of rejuvenating the bodyand slowing the aging the process isthe use of Infrared Therapy. While Infrared is not new, the method by which it is used is. Also,the development of new, morepowerful Infrared units like thePhoton Genius and new protocols (aprotocol is a method of makingInfrared therapeutically moreeffective) have produced excitingresults in the treatment of chronichealth problems. The appearance ofthe skin can tell a great deal aboutthe health of an individual. Skinblemishes, rashes, discoloration anddark circles under the eyes can allbe telltale signs of infections, allergies, toxic burdens, orexcessive nicotine, alcohol or drug use, or excessive stress.All of these signs indicate the diminished health of anindividual and should not be taken lightly. Toxins and SkinResearchers have analyzed the subcutaneous adipose layer (fatty tissue) just below the skin and have found that itcontains numerous toxins. These toxins come from theexternal environment or have been inhaled or ingested.These toxins include pesticides like DDT, PCB, dioxins,atrazine, heavy metals like mercury, lead and cadmium,pharmaceutical (drugs) residue, trichloroethylene (fromchlorinated drinking water), benzene (from air fresheners)toluene (from house paint). Researchers then analyzed thesweat from Infrared and found that it contained 80 to 85%water, sodium, trace minerals, uric acid, ammonia, cholesterol and a combination ofthe toxins listed above. These toxinsare related to many serious andchronic health conditions andshould not be found in the body inany quantity at any time. Traditionaldetoxification protocols using thecolon, lung, kidneys, liver andchelation alone were shown to be less effective than Infrared Therapy. The Photon Genius hasalso been found to be a beneficialadjunctive in helping with patients'detoxification from nicotine, alcoholand pharmaceuticals. The PhotonGenius has other health benefits inaddition to detoxification. It alsoimproves white blood cell activityand lymphatic drainage, whichimproves how the immune systemfunctions. The Photon Genius helps to reduce tissue inflammationand stimulates endorphin production, explaining itspopularity in the treatment of musculoskeletal injuries andarthritic conditions. Detoxification via the skin alsoprevents the patient from experiencing the HerxheimerReaction (known as the healing crisis), whose symptomsinclude fever, chills, headache, myalgia (muscle pain) andexacerbation of skin lesions. The Photon Genius iseffective in reducing and eliminating these Herxheimerreactions. 50 www.edskilling.comThe Photon Genius helps to reduce tissue inflammation and stimulates endorphin production, explaining its popularity in the treatment of musculoskeletal injuries and arthritic conditions.SECTION 7: THE PHOTON GENIUS AND YOUTUBE VIDEOSThere are literally dozens of Doctors and individuals on YouTube sharing their experiences with the Photon-Genius,the Photon Genie, and the Skilling Institute. If you had topick a single one to watch, we recommend that you watchthe following YouTube video with Doctors Tom and Joy Watson. Dr. Tom Watson, C.K., L.M.T., a clinical kinesiologist trained in oriental medicine and his wife Dr. Joy Watson, CTM,LaCH, a doctor of Naturopathy, operate two alternativemedicine clinics. This video is remarkable because it toucheson many subjects and many case histories. The WatsonClinics began using their Photon-Genius in the fall of 2010and this video was made on April 18, 2011. The Watson'shave very positive things to say about their experiences withthe Photon-Genius. The Watson's specialize in the treatment of \"catastrophic illnesses of all kinds and have over 20 years experience. \u0081 All of their patients appear to have more energy, more vitality and greater strength after using thePhoton Genius \u0081 They describe the activity of the Photon Genius as, o \"Improves circulation including lymphatic circulation, basically our immune system,loosens the lymph nodes, breaking down thethickness of the lymph fluids, so they candrain.\" o \"Our bodies are designed to heal ourselves.\"o \"Allows the body to cast out negative influences.\" o \"Our bodies will rejuvenate. We put that energy into the body and then the body hasenough energy to heal ourselves.\" o \"Adds coherent, harmonic and frequency energetics into the body to allow their bodyto overcome those things ailing them.\" \u0081 Of the more than twenty patient studies that they discuss with \"glowing\" results, perhaps the bestare as follows:o A hospice patient used the Photon Genius for two hours per day and after 14 days was able to goback to work. o A stage 4 prostate cancer patient used the Photon Genius two hours per day for 14 daysand was able to hold down a job. o An emphysema patient used the Genius three times per week and had her lungs cleared, nolonger requiring treatment for the emphysema. o A bladder cancer patient used the instrument for six weeks and their cancer was no longerdetectable, even after biopsy. o A terminal cancer patient bound by wheelchair and in hospice was able to use a walker andstand after only four uses in the Photon-Genius.

The less the voltage, the more prone that thecell is to divide, and if you can restore that voltagecell division automatically slows down.\" www.edskilling.com 51Section YOUTUBE VIDEOS\u0081 \"This is an area that I think we have sadly underestimated both in terms of the medical profession and also in the day to day living.\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N- 44s46TRe8&feature=related Dr. Eli Ber , a Naturopathic Physician and his experiences: Lyme Disease: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qUKVx8gPMw&feature=relatedCancer:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPy2jbN0250&feature=results_video&playnext=1&list=PL02905A16D386D272 Lori Philips, RN talks about how the Photon Genius helps in your medical practice:Practice: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWezY4mlHakCancer:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XXM_otxE3UAcross the World:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdWTrXcBgn4Epilepsy:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcfHjyh7db8Dr. Allen , Certified Olympic Chiropractor, talks about his Photon Genius experiences: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KO-8Y22ZosCraig Ray, practicing clinician and Part their Photon Genius UPON REQUEST.
