Email: laura.wherry@nyu.edu1 Introduction There is substantial evidence that health and socioeconomic inequalities persist across generations. A growing number of studies suggest that di erences in early life health environments may causally contribute to these disparities. Negative shocks to the in utero environment, in particular, have been found to be harmful to individuals' later life health and earnings. A handful of studies also examine positive interventions and nd that policies intended to improve early life experiences generate better adult outcomes (Almond and Currie, 2011; Almond et al., 2018). By extension, literatures in economics, epidemiology and child development predict that the causal impacts of these interventions should echo beyond the exposed generation, onto later o spring. Little is known, however, about the extent to which the early life environment a ects future generations, or the potential for public policy to alter such linkages. We consider whether public health interventions experienced in utero a ect the next generation's health. We focus on the impact of the largest source of health-related services for low-income individuals in the United States: the Medicaid program. Changes in program rules during the 1980s expanded access to low-income pregnant women who were not already connected to Medicaid through the welfare system, and led to a dramatic increase in prenatal coverage. There was considerable variation in the timing and magnitude of these expansions across states, which prior empirical research has harnessed to document the program's bene cial e ects on cohorts who gained in utero access. We build on this \\ rst generation\" research to investigate whether positive policy interventions in one generation transmit to the next generation. Our study makes three contributions. First, within the active \\early origins\" literature, the vast majority of causal studies con ne their analyses to treated cohorts. While an ever-expanding number of animal experiments provide compelling evidence that the e ects of early life environments can be transmitted to later generations,1human studies are more rare. We contribute to this literature by using a quasi-experimental design to document multi-generational e ects in humans. Second, we focus on documenting generationally persistent e ects of a widespread policy-driven intervention. Most of what we do know about how early life health conditions a ect later o spring comes from studies of exposure to disasters such as famine and disease outbreaks, which may not compare well to the e ects of more common (and malleable) health experiences. This is an important gap { particularly in light of current political debates about the cost of publicly provided health insurance { as substantive multiplier e ects to future generations would suggest that existing bene t-cost calculations underestimate the true value of government investments in children's health. Third, we advance knowledge of the impacts of the 1980s Medicaid expansions by putting for- ward a new research design that explicitly addresses ongoing debates about policy endogeneity, and the validity of using state-level variation in the expansions' timing and magnitude as a natural ex- periment. Following the pioneering work of Currie and Gruber (1996a,b), most investigations employ an instrumental variables model to isolate policy e ects from other potentially correlated changes in state characteristics. However, lack of information on the pre-expansion period (before 1979) has left open the possibility that estimates of the program's bene ts are contaminated by unobserved state 1Useful reviews of this literature include Daxinger and Whitelaw (2010, Heard 1pre-trends that were correlated with the expansions' timing and magnitude. We have collected ve ad- ditional years of information on state Medicaid rules, which allows us to measure state eligibility going back to 1975. With these measures, we estimate an event study model that allows exible estimation of the dynamic e ects of changes in Medicaid, and a direct assessment of the extent to which both Currie and Gruber's estimates, and our own estimates of the program's e ects on the next generation's health, re ect other underlying factors. To implement this, we classify states as either treated states or control states based on their expansion patterns across the 1975-1988 period, during which time prenatal Medicaid was made available to the lowest income families. Treated states are those that experienced sharp increases in Medicaid eligibility, while control states are those that trended more incrementally over time. We also use restricted data on Medicaid coverage among labor and delivery hospital discharges to validate the event study design, and provide important new evidence on the impacts of the expansions on actual take-up. Our main analyses are based on information that is available in restricted-use versions of the U.S. Vital Statistics birth records. With these data, we analyze infant health outcomes among two generations. First, we consider those who were directly exposed to the expansions: infants born between 1975 and 1988. We call these cohorts the \\ rst generation.\" Most previous research has focused on a subset of these cohorts, who were born after 1979. Then, we move on to investigate whether the bene ts ofin utero Medicaid exposure a ected the next generation by looking at birth outcomes among the rst generation's o spring. We call these infants the \\second generation.\" For the rst generation, we use state and year of birth to assign policy generosity, and, for the second generation, we use mother's state and year of birth to link to measures of mother's early life Medicaid exposure. We estimate Medicaid's impacts on standard measures of infant health, including birthweight and low birthweight. These outcomes are strong candidates for a second generation exploration because previous research has shown that birthweight is tied to measures of maternal health such as obesity and diabetes, for which there is already evidence of long-term program e ects (Miller and Wherry, 2019). Moreover, birthweight is highly predictive of later life health and economic outcomes, making it an outcome of particular interest. We also investigate other measures of second generation health, including variants of gestational length and weight-for-gestational age. Finally, we explore potential transmission mechanisms. In addition to con rming Medicaid's impacts on the rst generation's health at birth as a potential pathway, we consider changes in rst generation fertility patterns that might be indicative of selection, and changes in rst generation health and health behaviors during pregnancy. We nd that the expansions increased the rst generation's likelihood of being enrolled in Medicaid at birth, and we validate the past research nding that the expansions reduced the fraction who were low birthweight. Then we go on to show that the bene ts of expanding early life access to the program spill over onto the next generation's health: mothers who were more likely to be eligible in utero gave birth to healthier o spring. A 10 percentage point increase in the rst generation's in utero eligibility increases the second generation's average birthweight by approximately 7 grams. We also observe statistically signi cant reductions in very low birthweight and very preterm birth, and suggestive declines in the incidence of low birthweight and small-for-gestational age. The estimates are robust to a variety of speci cation checks, including alternative state and year control variables, changes in the sample de nition, alternative measures of eligibility, and a version of the model that omits the control states. 2They are also robust to new methods proposed by Callaway and Sant'Anna (2020) that account for issues of bias found in traditional two-way xed e ects and event study models. Documenting the presence of multi-generational spillovers is an important contribution in its own right. Moreover, back-of-the envelope calculations suggest that the magnitude of the spillovers is economically important. Our point estimates of the e ects of in utero Medicaid access on the second generation's birthweight suggest medical cost savings in the rst year of life that are about 60 percent of the costs of providing the rst generation with in utero coverage. Importantly, this calculation does not include any other bene ts that were likely accrued to the second generation, such as later life savings in medical costs or social supports. Nor does it include bene ts associated with previously documented improvements in the rst generation's health and economic outcomes. If these bene ts were incorporated, the costs savings would be substantially larger. We nd no evidence that changes in overall fertility can explain the e ects on infant health, but we do nd a small shift in the racial composition of women giving birth: rst-generation Medicaid exposure increases the fraction of second-generation births that are to white women, and decreases the fraction to Black women. Controlling for mothers' demographic characteristics does not change the baseline results, however, and results are similar when we focus on white births, a sub-group for whom we would not expect to see e ects if the main estimates are driven by changes in racial composition. Therefore, we do not believe that selection is driving the results. Our results establish that public investments in prenatal health have persistent impacts beyond the treated generation. By quantifying these e ects, we establish that bene t/cost ratios based only on outcomes directly experienced by cohorts who were immediately a ected by the Medicaid expansions underestimate the program's overall e\u000ecacy. More broadly, our analyses suggest that even \\long-run\" studies of early-life interventions may fail to capture the full extent of bene ts conferred. The remainder of our paper proceeds in the following way: Section 2 provides further information about the existing literature on \\early life\" health and multi-generational processes. In Section 3, we describe the Medicaid program and the nature of the 1980s expansions. Sections 4 and 5 describe our empirical strategy and data. We present our results in Section 6 and conclude with a discussion in Section 7. 2 Background More than 40 years ago, Forsdahl (1977) put forward a provocative hypothesis that the period of gestation has signi cant impacts on individual health that reach well into adulthood. This theory gained further traction following Barker (1990), and in recent years there has been growing scienti c agreement that the time both before, and immediately after birth, are critical periods when the developing body takes adaptive cues from its surrounding environment (often called the \\Barker Hypothesis\"). A key feature of the \\fetal origins\" hypothesis is that the health e ects of the in utero environment can remain latent for many years. We have yet to achieve a full understanding of the processes underlying these phenomena, but a leading theory is that the fetus's surrounding environment alters genetic programming through the \\switching on\" of speci c genes. Numerous economists and epidemiologists have used quasi-experimental designs to test the fetal origins hypothesis, and have found that in utero and early life health experiences can have important 3e ects on later life outcomes. Although the vast majority of studies have identi ed these e ects us- ing short-term, extreme events such as disease outbreaks and famines,2a few have recently emerged demonstrating the long term e\u000ecacy of more wide-spread, positive, health interventions.3Most of these studies focus on historical events, or settings outside the U.S. Three exceptions, Bailey et al. (2020); Bitler and Figinski (2019); Hoynes et al. (2016), investigate the 1960's roll out of the U.S. Food Stamp program and nd that access to the program in early childhood generated improvements in later life economic and health outcomes, including conditions related to cardiovascular disease such as obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes.4 In this vein, recent work nds that changes to Medicaid rules that expanded coverage to low- income pregnant women had long-term bene ts on their o spring. Focusing on variation generated by the targeted 1980s expansions, Miller and Wherry (2019) nd that, like the Food Stamp program, in utero exposure to Medicaid reduced the likelihood of having metabolic-syndrome and circulatory- system linked chronic illnesses in adulthood. Importantly for our study, when these later life diseases are experienced during pregnancy, women and their children are put at risk for a variety of health prob- lems, including an increased risk of gestational diabetes, complications related to high blood pressure, and preterm birth (Catalano and Ehrenberg, 2006). Moving beyond health, Miller and Wherry also document that in utero exposure to the program is associated with increases in educational attainment. Similar results are found in a large number of studies evaluating the long-term e ects of the 1980s and 1990s expansions to broader age groups (Brown et al., 2020; Cohodes et al., 2016; Currie and Meyer, 2016; Wherry et al., 2017),5 although these studies do not separately examine the e ect of in utero exposure from later childhood exposure. Miller and Wherry nd that this distinction is important, with the prenatal expansions generating substantially bigger impacts. Taken as a whole, the existing literature has generated two broad conclusions. First, early life health shocks have long-term impacts on the health and economic outcomes of those who experience them. Second, many widespread public health interventions targeted at children have substantive positive bene ts that last well into adulthood. A natural question is whether these e ects endure to the next generation. Economists have previously documented that health and economic status persist across multiple generations (Clark, 2014; Halliday et al., 2021; Solon, 2018), but quasi-experimental 2Examples from this large (2006); et al. (2010); Almond and Mazumder (2011); Chen and Zhou (2007); Painter et al. et al. (1976); Roseboom et al. (1975); Susser Ewijk (2011) [nutrition], Almond et [pollution]. Quasi-experimental studies of stress (Persson and Rossin-Slater, 2018) and pollution (Sanders, 2012) also nd detrimental e the long-term e ects of education interventions such as Head Start, which includes a health component (e.g. Carneiro and Ginja, 2014; Deming, 2009; Garces et al., 2002; Ludwig and Miller, 2007; Conti et al., 2016), and policies that reduce pollution exposure (Isen et al., 2017; Nilsson, 2009). 5Three other studies document how the introduction of Medicaid between 1966 and 1970 improved later life health. Using geographic variation in program roll-out to identify the e ects of exposure to Medicaid under age 6, Boudreaux et al. (2016) nd that Medicaid reduced the probability of having a chronic health condition in adulthood. Using a similar strategy, Sohn (2017) nds that Medicaid's initial roll-out was associated with lower adult mortality. Goodman-Bacon (2021) uses variation in pre-existing welfare eligibility levels (since Medicaid was originally linked to welfare receipt) and nds that the introduction of Medicaid reduced later life mortality and disability, increased employment, and reduced disability bene ts for cohorts who were exposed to the program early in life. 4investigations are rare. We know little about what drives the correlations, or the potential for policy based treatments to alter them. The dearth of work among social scientists likely results from the multiple challenges of identifying exogenous variation in early life health environments and linking that variation to data that provides relevant information on multiple generations. These challenges can be overcome in biological studies, where an accumulation of evidence based on animal experiments nds that prenatal health shocks have persistent generational e ects. As an example, studies have documented that rats that are malnourished before or during pregnancy produce o spring with smaller brains and reduced cognition, even if the o spring receive su\u000ecient nutrition after birth. Importantly, these e ects are not only observed in the immediate o spring, but are present in later generations as well.6Similar multi-generational patterns have been found with in-utero exposure to disease, stress, and smoke.7One explanation for this pattern is that the biological predecessors of the ovaries and sperm cells, which produce the next generation, are already present at the fetal stage and are therefore exposed to any insult experienced by the fetus. In spite of the methodological challenges, a few epidemiologists and economists have been able to shed light on this question by exploiting historical shocks. Painter et al. (2008) investigate the multi- generational impacts of the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944-1945, which reduced the food consumption of a previously well-nourished population by more than 75 percent. They nd that the o spring of those who were exposed to the famine in utero had worse health in later life. Similarly, Almond et al. (2010) nd that fetal exposure to malnutrition resulting from the 1959-1961 Chinese famine increased low birthweight incidence in the next generation. Looking beyond the e ects of extreme nutritional deprivation to disease exposure, Richter and Robling (2016) nd that the children of those who were exposed in utero to the 1918-1919 in uenza pandemic grew up to have lower levels of educational attainment. Similarly, Black et al. (2019) nd that Norwegian cohorts exposed to radioactive fallout during the in utero period had children with lower cognitive ability.8 A small number of studies examine intergenerational health e ects in the modern U.S. context. Two studies relate local variation in infant mortality rates at the time of the mother's birth to her later o spring's health. Here, the infant mortality rate proxies for broad disease exposure, which can be driven by many factors, including access to medical care. Almond et al. (2012) nd that higher exposure to disease is associated with worse long-term outcomes and an increase in the probability that future o spring are below the low birthweight threshold. Almond and Chay (2006) focus on the dramatic improvements in Black infant mortality rates that coincided with the Civil Rights Act, and nd that Black women born during the late 1960s had a reduced likelihood of giving birth to a low birthweight infant. A third study, Colmer and Voorheis (2020), documents improved educational outcomes among the grandchildren of cohorts who bene ted from reductions in pollution exposure 6A few examples include Aerts and Van al. (2012); al. and Bale (2011); Rehan et al. (2012). 8A few studies also investigate multi-generational e ects of health events that occur at later ages. van den Berg and Pinger (2016) investigate multi-generational e ects of pre-pubertorial exposure to the German famine of 1916-1918 and nd evidence of mental health e ects on later generations, which they attribute to biological rather than social processes. B\u007f utikofer and Salvanes (2020) nd that in Norway, generational persistence in educational attainment was mitigated by a 1940s tuberculosis control program. 5driven by the 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments.9 We build on this small number of studies by harnessing a policy driven increase in access to a widespread public health program that is a critical component of the U.S. safety net. This allows us to establish multi-generational linkages associated with more common and contemporaneous variation in early life health experiences, while simultaneously quantifying long-term bene ts of the Medicaid program that have not been previously considered. Medicaid may alter biological associations across generations by increasing the use of prenatal care, which provides nutrition and drug counseling, im- munizations, early diagnoses and direct interventions.10Along these lines, Currie and Gruber (1996b) link changes in prenatal Medicaid access to reductions in treated cohorts' probability of being low birthweight, and maternal birthweight is predictive of later o spring's birthweight (e.g. Currie and Moretti, 2007; Black et al., 2007; Royer, 2009). Access to Medicaid may also reduce maternal stress: in an analysis of the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, Finkelstein et al. (2012) nd that those who gained health insurance through the experiment experienced substantive improvements in mental health. Several studies have linked parental and in utero stress to children's well-being (Black for the next generation's health. Besides biological pathways, Medicaid may of course a ect the next generation's health through its documented impacts on the treated generation's human capital and earnings. As described earlier, numerous studies nd that the Medicaid expansions had positive e ects on treated cohorts' educational and economic outcomes in adulthood, and it is well known that children living in high income families are healthier than children living in low income families (Currie and Almond, 2011; Case et al., 2002, 2005). This is intuitive, as parents with more income have more resources to invest in their children, experience lower stress levels (Aizer et al., 2016; Evans and Garthwaite, 2014) and engage in healthier behaviors (Hoynes et al., 2015). 3 Medicaid and the 1980s Expansions Medicaid currently provides health insurance coverage for nearly half of all births in the U.S. (Markus et al., 2013). Eligibility criteria for pregnant women were relatively restrictive until the 1980s, when a series of state and federal policy changes greatly expanded access. We describe the inception of the Medicaid program, including which groups were initially eligible, and the later policy changes that expanded eligibility, below. Created in 1965 as part of the Social Security Amendments, Medicaid was initially available to low-income, non-disabled women of reproductive age who received cash assistance through the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program.11Eligibility for AFDC was restricted to single 9Two additional studies examine the multi-generational e ects of post-natal early life educational interventions that include a health component. Barr and Gibbs (2019) and Rossin-Slater and W\u007f ust (2020) examine the e ects of exposure to preschool in the U.S. and Denmark, respectively, on educational outcomes for the next generation and nd positive e ects. In addition, Barr and Gibbs nd evidence of reduced teen pregnancy and criminal activity in the second generation. 10Several studies of Medicaid's prenatal expansions document increased use or improved timing and adequacy of prenatal care (Currie and Gruber, 1996b, 2001; Dave et al., 2008; Dubay et al., 2001; Howell, 2001). Medical studies also provide support for prenatal care as a likely pathway (Lu et al., 2003). 11Since Medicaid was initially tied directly to AFDC, many women received bene ts from both programs. However, as we describe in detail in Appendix Section A.1, the policy variation we exploit is driven by expansions to Medicaid and not by changes in AFDC bene ts. 6women with at least one dependent child. Low-income women with rst time pregnancies and those with marital partners did not qualify for coverage. Moreover, AFDC income eligibility thresholds were generally much lower than the federal poverty line. The average threshold was 61% of the federal poverty line (FPL) in 1979, and ranged from 24% to 99% across states.12 Because Medicaid is a joint federal-state program, the federal government sets mandatory eligibility requirements, but states have some exibility to extend eligibility to other especially needy population groups. Dating back to 1966, a number of states exercised di erent options to extend eligibility to certain pregnant women not eligible for AFDC. The options o ered coverage to speci c groups of pregnant women, such as rst-time pregnant women who would later qualify for AFDC, or pregnant women in two-parent families where the principal earner was unemployed and who met the income and resource requirements for AFDC.13Some options extended eligibility to all pregnant women who were nancially eligible for AFDC, but who did not meet the program's family structure requirements (i.e. women who were notsingle mothers with dependent children). Adoption of these options was not uniform across states, and, prior to the 1980s, there were substantive di erences in eligibility criteria that were applied to pregnant women. Beginning in the early 1980s, there was emerging national consensus on the importance of prenatal care for pregnant women, which led to major changes to the Medicaid program (Howell, 2001). More states began to exercise options to expand Medicaid eligibility to pregnant women who did not meet the family structure requirements for AFDC, but who did meet the AFDC nancial eligibility criteria. This wave of new optional state expansions was followed by two federal mandates requiring that all states expand. Figure 1 Panel (a) which is based on information we have gathered on state policy rules back to 1975, documents that these changes had a large e ect: between 1975 and 1988 the share of women who quali ed for pregnancy-related Medicaid climbed from about 12 to 20 percent.14Here, and throughout the rest of the paper, we multiply all dichotomous variables by 100 for ease of presentation. Panel (b), which uses data on hospital discharges for labor and delivery between 1979-1988, shows that this increase corresponded to a steep increase in the share of mothers who were enrolled in the Medicaid program at the time of their child's birth.15To our knowledge, this is the rst time that administrative data have been used to document that take-up patterns among pregnant women mirrored the eligibility expansions.16 Following the original terminology used by Currie and Gruber (1996b), we refer to these changes in eligibility as the \\targeted\" expansions. They di er from \\broad\" expansions that occurred later because they were aimed at very low income pregnant women (i.e. those with income levels below AFDC thresholds). Beginning in the late 1980s, the broad expansions allowed states to further expand coverage to pregnant women and children with higher incomes. We cannot make use of variation 12Authors' calculation based on payment standard for a family of 3 in 1979. 13Appendix Section A provides a detailed discussion of each of the di erent state options described in this section. 14Additional information about the calculator and data used to calculate eligibility in this gure is provided in Section 4 and Appendix Section A. 15While the changes track quite well across both of these measures, there are a few years in which coverage actually exceeds eligibility. We believe this is due to the fact that our eligibility estimates are based on women of child-bearing age, whereas our estimates of coverage are derived from a sample of women actually giving birth. These groups may di er on some important dimensions such as age and income. 16Dave et al. (2010) use this source of hospital discharge data to examine the e ects of later Medicaid expansions (1985-1996) on the health insurance coverage of pregnant women at the time of child birth. 7generated by broad changes in our analyses because most of the a ected cohorts are still too young to allow for multi-generational analyses. We note, however, that previous studies have documented that the targeted expansions had stronger e ects on treated cohorts' outcomes (Currie and Gruber, 1996b; Miller and Wherry, 2019). We also note that pregnant women who enrolled in Medicaid through the expansions received coverage for prenatal care and services, hospital and postpartum care, and one year of Medicaid eligibility for their newborns (Congressional Research Service, 1988). With this background in mind, we investigate multi-generational e ects of in utero Medicaid access by focusing on the o spring of cohorts who were born between 1975 and 1988. We refer to the mothers in these cohorts as the \\ rst\" (exposed) generation, and to their later infants as the \\second\" generation. 4 Empirical Strategy 4.1 Background Currie and Gruber examine the impact of the prenatal Medicaid expansions on contemporaneous infant health by estimating a model that exploits variation in the magnitude of the expansions across states and over time. Speci cally, they estimate: ynb= + Elig nb+\u0016n+\u0015b+ Xnb+\u000fnb fraction of infants born in state nand yearbwho were below the low birthweight threshold,\u0016nand\u0015bare state of birth and year of birth xed e ects, respectively, and Xnbis a vector of state-year control variables that re ect the demographic, economic, and policy environment. Elig nb is the fraction of women of child-bearing age in the state-year who were eligible for Medicaid in the event of a pregnancy. Currie and Gruber's analyses, as well as later studies that build upon this research design, begin in 1979, on the eve of the Medicaid program's rapid expansion. Acknowledging that changes in states' demographic and economic conditions could cause changes in the fraction eligible for Medicaid even without a change in policy, Currie and Gruber pioneered a \\simulated instrument\" approach in which they instrument actual eligibility with a simulated measure that isolates changes driven only by changes in Medicaid rules and is independent of changes in states' demographic and economic characteristics. The simulated measure is constructed by applying Medicaid eligibility rules in each state and year to a national sample of potential mothers (women ages 15-44) drawn from each year of the Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey. Our analyses also rely on simulated eligibility measures to capture changes in Medicaid policy, following the convention that has been adopted by much of the literature.17Appendix Figure A1 shows that national trends in actual and simulated eligibility measures are very closely related. Using this model, Currie and Gruber nd that a 10 percentage point increase in prenatal Medicaid 17To create the simulated in utero measure, we use a national random sample of 3,000 women from each year of the Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS). Since childhood eligibility was also changing for these cohorts, we also examine whether the changes in prenatal eligibility were correlated with changes in childhood eligibility, and whether including controls for childhood eligibility a ects the estimates. To construct measures of simulated childhood eligibility, we use national random samples of 1,000 children at each age between 1 and 18 in each survey year and calculate the fraction of children in each state, year, and age that would be eligible for Medicaid based on state eligibility rules. We then add the estimates across ages for each cohort, to create a measure of cumulative simulated eligibility throughout childhood for each cohort and state and use this as a measure of generosity during childhood. We describe these calculations in more detail in Appendix Section A.3. 8eligibility under the targeted expansions reduced the rst generation's incidence of low birthweight by 2.6 percent.18Subsequent papers have extended their approach to look at outcomes associated with later childhood expansions by replacing Elig nbwith a measure of cumulative or average childhood eligibility from birth to age 18 (e.g. Brown et al., 2020; Cohodes et al., 2016; Thompson, 2017) and using a comparable simulated eligibility instrumental variables approach. Noting that the prenatal period is a particularly receptive stage of development, with the potential to yield large returns on investment, Miller and Wherry (2019) further extend this design by including separate measures of prenatal and later childhood eligibility. They nd that this distinction is important, with most of the long-run health improvements driven by the expansions in prenatal access. It would be natural to extend this framework to examine the expansions' impact on second gen- eration outcomes. As Currie and Gruber note, however, identi cation in this model rests on the assumption that state Medicaid policy was exogenous to treated cohorts' birth outcomes. Although previous analyses have included a large number of state and year varying controls, some researchers have argued that the changes are not \\randomly occurring natural experiments,\" and they speculate that estimates of the expansions' impacts re ect other underlying state level changes (Dave et al., 2008). The traditional research design has previously been estimated with very limited years of data from the pre-expansion era, which restricts researchers' ability to test for di erential changes across states prior to the expansions. Therefore, we have collected additional years of information on state program rules, and use these data to document changes in state-level prenatal Medicaid eligibility back to 1975.19Then we implement a more transparent event-study design that allows direct examination of the extent to which state-level pre-period outcomes varied with state-level Medicaid expansions, and addresses concerns about potential contaminants. Our analyses start by documenting the evolution of state-level Medicaid eligibility. Appendix Figure A2 shows the time path of eligibility from 1975-1988 for each of the fty states. It is immediately clear that states exhibit di erent expansion patterns, and that these patterns fall into two dominant types: many states experienced gradual increases in eligibility throughout the period (e.g. California and Rhode Island), while others exhibit at, low levels of prenatal coverage during the 1970s that are later punctuated by a large, abrupt, increase (e.g. South Carolina and Maine). This is exactly what the discussion in Section 3 should lead us to expect. Speci cally, in early years, states that initially embraced strict eligibility criteria and did not avail themselves of the state options, exhibit low eligibility levels that change very little. In later years, we observe discrete jumps in these states that correspond to a large, voluntary state-level expansion or one of the later federally mandated expansions. In contrast, states that took early advantage of the existing state options to cover low-income pregnant women exhibit smaller, more gradual increases that start earlier, and are less pronounced in the wake of the federal changes. 18We replicate this result using their empirical approach in Appendix Table A1. Note that, for the purpose of this replication, we follow Currie and Gruber and express the outcome as the number of low birthweight births per 1000 infants. The rst column displays the results reprinted from their paper and the second column is our replication exercise. The remaining columns update the analysis to cluster standard errors by state (column 3), add the state by year controls we implement in our model, described in detail below (column 4), and weight by the number of births in each cell (column 5). 19Information on eligibility prior to 1975 is very spotty, therefore we begin our sample period in 1975. 94.2 Classi cation of Treatment and Control States Using Appendix Figure A2 as a guide, we organize states into \\treated\" states (those that experienced a sharp jump in eligibility) and \\control\" states (those for whom eligibility trended smoothly). Our event study is based on di erences in the evolution of prenatal eligibility across these two groups. The treatment group consists of the 28 states in which eligibility was stagnant for a minimum of the ve years between 1975 and 1979, and that later experienced a large positive shock. We focus on shocks that took place between 1980 and 1985 to ensure that we have at least ve \\post-event\" years over which to observe the expansions' e ects. We include the 22 remaining states as \\control\" states to help identify secular changes that were separate from the Medicaid expansions.20 Figure 2 shows which states we classify as control states, which states we classify as treatment states, and the timing of the expansion for the treatment states. Given that \\treatment\" requires a large, abrupt increase in eligibility, it is unsurprising that treated states are disproportionately located in the South and Midwest, where Medicaid was less generous in the pre-expansion period, and transfer policies have historically been less generous.21Figure 3 Panel (a) provides further insights into the sources of our identifying variation by combining all of the treated states together, and documenting how the changes in eligibility break down by source. The sources are shown additively from most to least restrictive (shown from lowest to highest lines on the graph), and include changes in eligibility driven by: changes in AFDC rules (solid blue line), targeted expansions occurring via state options (long dashed red line), targeted expansions occurring under federal mandates (short dashed green line), and broader income-based expansions (dash dot yellow line). The last category is concentrated at the end of the period, and re ects optional state expansions that included pregnant women with family incomes up to the poverty line.22 It is easy to see that prior to the 1980s, Medicaid eligibility in treated states was largely determined by state AFDC rules, and that these states were less likely to take up state options than the control states. Beginning in the early 1980s, a few treatment states increased eligibility through the state options. This was followed by a sizeable bump under the federal mandates. Between 1975 and 1988, prenatal eligibility roughly doubled in treatment states, from just under 9 percent to 18 percent. In contrast, Figure 3 Panel (b) shows that control states started o with higher eligibility, because they had already implemented the state options, and that eligibility gradually increased over time as more 20We did not have a speci c algorithm to de ne treatment and control states or event time. Rather, each of the four authors individually classi ed states based on Appendix Figure A2, and then we decided on a consistent classi cation as a group. We relied on measures of simulated eligibility, rather than actual eligibility, to ensure that changes in eligibility are driven by policy changes and not by demographic or economic shifts, and there were few classi cation discrepancies across the authors. States with large changes outside the 1980-1985 period are included in the control group, but the few states that fall into this category do not a ect our results: we show that estimates are similar when we drop the control states from the analysis. 21Prior work has found that racism played a role in generating a less generous safety net (Lee and Roemer, 2006), and, Appendix Table A2 shows that treated states have slightly higher Black populations than control states. We multiply all dichotomous variables by 100 for ease of presentation. There are a few small di erences in other demographic and economic characteristics across treatment and control states. Our analyses include state xed e ects to account for any time-invariant di erences, and we show that our estimates are robust to including a large number of state-year varying economic and policy controls, and region-year xed e ects that control for common shocks to outcomes within regions over time. 22Under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, states were allowed to expand Medicaid to pregnant women with family incomes below 100% FPL starting in April 1987. See additional discussion in Appendix Section A.1, along with more detailed breakouts of the di erent eligibility paths in Appendix Figures A19 and A20. 10options were adopted. As a result, the federal mandates had smaller e ects on eligibility. Figure 4 demonstrates that among treated states there is also variation in when the large jumps occur. States are grouped together by the initial year of the abrupt increase (the \\expansion year\"), and eligibility is plotted relative to the year prior to expansion, with the number of states expanding in each year shown in parentheses. While the most common expansion years are 1982 (11 states) and 1985 (7 states), when federal policy provided states with new options to expand coverage (1982), and mandated expansion of coverage to more women (1985), there are also states that experience large expansions in every other year between 1980 and 1985.23In our main event study framework, we rely on the di erential timing of expansions across states, as well as di erences between treated and control states, to identify the e ects of Medicaid separately from time trends. 4.3 Event Study The event study takes the following form: ynb= +3X t=\u00005;t6=\u00001 t1fb\u0000e\u0003 n=tg+\u0016n+\u0015b+ Xnb+\u000fnb individuals born in state nand yearb. Initially, we estimate the expansions' e ects on the rst generation's in utero Medicaid eligibility and coverage at birth. Then, in line with the existing literature, we examine the rst generation's health outcomes at birth. The primary goal of our study, however, is to understand whether the bene ts associated with the rst generation's prenatal access to Medicaid had spillover e ects onto their o spring. To do so, we replace rst generation outcomes with the outcomes of the o spring of women who were born in state nand yearb. The key regressors are the series of dummy variables 1 fb\u0000e\u0003 n=tgthat take on a value of one for each event time year, where event time is de ned for each treated state relative to the year in which it rst experienced a discrete jump in eligibility ( e\u0003 n). We omit the year before each state's large expansion t=\u00001, so the estimated ts are relative to the year before the expansion occurred. For example, 1is the e ect one year after the discrete change in eligibility, relative to one year before the jump.24We do not de ne event time for the control states since they do not experience a large discrete expansion. The control states help estimate secular trends across cohorts and the e ects of the control variables.25 As in previous studies, we include rst generation state of birth xed e ects \u0016n, to account for xed di erences in the outcomes of mothers and their children across states, and rst generation year of birth xed e ects \u0015b, to account for national changes over time. Our baseline model also follows the literature by incorporating a large number of rst generation state and year of birth control variables 23See Appendix A.1 for more details on these policy changes. 24By choosing to classify treated states as those with a large, abrupt eligibility change in the middle of the 1975-1988 period, we are able to observe at least 5 years before the event and 4 years after the event. We bin event time observations that are more than 5 years before the event and more than 4 years after the event. We estimate, but do not report these coe\u000ecients, because they are based on an unbalanced sample. Binning allows us to separately identify treatment e ects from secular time trends even when we do not include the control states in the model (Schmidheiny and Siegloch, 2019). 25A potential concern is that using partially treated states (those with smaller and less abrupt changes in eligibility) as a control group will lead to biased estimates (Schmidheiny and Siegloch, 2019). Figure 9 documents that the pattern of estimates is similar (albeit with larger standard errors) when the control states are not included in the analyses. We also note that there is little di erence in the magnitude of the eligibility changes across treated states (Figure 4). Therefore, we do not use variation in the magnitude of the expansions as an additional source of identifying variation in our model. 11including the unemployment rate, personal income per capita, maximum welfare bene t for a family of 4, indicators for state parental consent and noti cation laws, state Medicaid restrictions for abortion, and population demographic controls for each state and year. Sensitivity analyses include versions of the model that eliminate the control variables, or add additional controls, such as region-year xed e ects, and state-year controls at the time of the second generation's birth, which we discuss in more detail below. Our results are not sensitive to their inclusion. Our estimates are weighted by the size of the second generation birth cohort.26We cluster our standard errors by mothers' state of birth. Appendix Figure A3 plots second generation health outcomes by event time, where each treatment timing group is shown in a di erent color. Control states are shown in pink, with event time centered at 1982. It is easy to see that, consistent with the decades long national trend in infant health (United Health Foundation, 2020; Wang, 2010), and pre-dating the expansions, second generation health was declining. Linear trend estimates based on pre-expansion data are shown in solid lines, and clearly vary across state groups, possibly re ecting di ering trends in state demographic characteristics, the demo- graphics of women giving birth, adoption of health technologies, or changes in state policies, including expansions of prenatal Medicaid eligibility that occurred before those we study here. Appendix Figure A4 documents that rst generation health also trended di erently across state groups. To ensure that our estimates are not contaminated by state di erences in pre-expansion trajectories, we remove linear pre-trends following the two-step de-trending procedure implemented in Goodman-Bacon (2020) and described in more detail in Section 5. This research design is a departure from the conventional approach, which exploits state and cohort variation in the timing and magnitude of the expansions but does not address potential di er- ences in states' pre-period trajectories. Another advantage of our research design is that it provides non-parametric estimates of the expansions' dynamic e ects. Assuming that treatment e ects are ho- mogeneous across treatment groups, estimates generated by the event study will be unbiased, even in the case of staggered treatment timing. As described below, we examine the importance of this assumption using the method proposed by Callaway and Sant'Anna (2020) and obtain very similar results. 5 Data Our measures of Medicaid eligibility are based on data in the Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey and are described in more detail in Section 4 and Appendix Section A.3. We also analyze Medicaid take-up among pregnant mothers using restricted-use data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS). The NHDS data provide discharge-level information for a nationally representative sample of non-Federal, short-stay hospitals, and include the expected payer for the hospital visit. This allows us to identify births paid for by Medicaid. Because the NHDS data are based on administrative hospital records, they are not subject to misreporting issues that are common in survey data (see Davern et al., 2009; Klerman et al., 2005), but unlike our other data series, they are not available before 1979.27In our event study analyses, we estimate the pre-period coe\u000ecients using 26The results are robust to weighting by the size of the rst generation cohort instead. 27We acknowledge that if some pregnant women did not enroll in Medicaid until delivery then the NHDS data could produce an upper bound estimate of the fraction of infants who gained in utero coverage. Using Medicaid claims data, Ellwood and Kenney (1995) document that the share of women with Medicaid deliveries who enrolled during the rst 12all available data. We also apply the NHDS survey weights. Using diagnosis and procedure codes based on the International Classi cation of Diseases coding system28we identify 187,488 labor and delivery hospitalizations with expected payer information between 1979 and 1988. To conduct our main analyses of birth outcomes, we use the 1975-2017 U.S. Vital Statistics Natality Data Files.29These les contain individual birth records for the full census of U.S. births. The data include information on infants' health, gender, parity, and year and state of birth. They also include detailed demographic information about each infant's mother, including her state of birth and age, which allows us to approximate her year of birth.30The latter variables are critical to our second generation analyses, as they allow measures of in utero Medicaid eligibility to be matched to each mother in the rst generation. In the second generation analyses we exclude infants whose mothers were born outside of the United States, as well as mothers born in Arizona, which did not adopt a state Medicaid program until 1982. We begin by using the event study framework to reassess Currie and Gruber's rst-generation results. Currie and Gruber focus on the incidence of low birthweight (less than 2500 grams) among infants born between 1979 and 1992. Appendix Table A1 shows that we are able to replicate their results when we apply their research design to the same cohorts. Moving forward, our event study analysis changes the included cohorts in two ways. First, because a convincing event study requires pre-period data, we add the four cohorts born between 1975 and 1978. Second, the second generation analyses would ideally include all births to women born between 1975 and 1992, but many women born in the 1990s have not given birth by 2017, so we focus on cohorts born between 1975 and 1988. This ensures that all rst generation cohorts that were a ected by the targeted prenatal expansions are included, while allowing us to observe each cohort's fertility through age 28. The analyses of second generation outcomes is restricted to infants whose mothers meet this age criteria to ensure that each maternal cohort contributes equally to the identifying variation, and that cohort-level comparisons are across women who are giving birth at the same age. We further restrict the second generation analyses to rst births only, as this generates a more representative sample of births across cohorts. During our time frame, 81% of rst births, and 62% of all births, were to women aged 28 or younger.31We test the robustness of our results to both of these restrictions below. The second generation analyses include infants born between 1990 and 2017.32We examine the impacts of the prenatal expansions on the next generation's average birthweight and incidence of low birthweight. These outcomes are standard measures of infant health and are highly predictive of later life health, cognitive and economic outcomes (e.g. Black et al., 2007; Figlio et al., 2014). We also explore trimester were 50 percent (California), 52 percent (Georgia), 69 percent (Michigan), and 49 percent (Tennessee) in 1987. The authors also document higher rst trimester enrollment among women receiving cash assistance, ranging from 66-79 percent. These take up rates were almost certainly higher at later stages of pregnancy but before delivery, suggesting that the vast majority of women enrolled prior to delivery. Related to this, we remind the reader that all children who were covered at the time of delivery were eligible for coverage during their rst year of life. 28Details are found in Appendix Section D. 29Beginning in 2005, mother's state of birth information is only available in the restricted access data, so we use the restricted data from 2005-2017. 30Miller and Wherry (2016) show that using age to impute birth year leads to nearly identical simulated eligibility assignments as using actual birth year. 31Authors' calculations from the Vital Statistics Natality Files. 32We restrict births to women ages 15 or older. The second generation sample, therefore begins in 1990, since this is year that the 1975 cohort turns 15. 13other outcomes available in the national natality data, including very low birthweight (weighing less than 1500 grams), gestational length (in weeks), preterm (born before 37 weeks gestation), and very preterm (born before 28 weeks gestation). As described in Kramer (1987a,b), birthweight is determined in part by gestational length. For this reason, we also consider a common measure of intrauterine growth: whether the infant is below the 10th percentile of birthweight for gestational age (\\small for gestational age\").33 We collapse the data into cells based on the rst generation's state of birth and year of birth. We then merge each cell with corresponding measures of actual and simulated Medicaid eligibility, and with information on states' economic conditions (state unemployment rate and per capita income), demographic composition (age distribution, marital status, educational attainment and race), safety net generosity, and abortion policies. Additional details about these control variables and sources are provided in Appendix Section D. As discussed in Section 4, second generation outcomes were trending di erently in treatment and control states in the pre-expansion era. To ensure that our estimates are not contaminated by di er- ential linear pre-trends, we directly remove them using the two-step de-trending method implemented in Goodman-Bacon (2020). For each treated state and outcome,34we estimate a linear trend using data only from years prior to the expansion, then extrapolate this estimated trend through all years of data, and subtract the predicted values of each outcome from the observed values. Since control states do not have a clear expansion year, the linear \\pre-trend\" is estimated using data from 1975-1981, as 1982 is the year of the national trend break in eligibility (Figure 1). The underlying assumption in the event study model is therefore that outcomes would have continued to follow their linear pre-trends in the absence of the expansions. Since linear pre-trends are removed from our analysis, the event study provides information on any remaining non-linear di erences across states in the pre-period. 6 Results 6.1 Eligibility Estimates Figure 5 provides \\ rst stage\" event study estimates based on equation (2), where Panel (a) shows the estimated change in prenatal eligibility and Panel (b) shows the estimated change in simulated prenatal eligibility, both of which are calculated using the CPS, as described in Appendix Section A.3. Recall that both of these variables capture the fraction of women who are eligible for Medicaid, rather than the fraction who received Medicaid. The horizontal axis denotes the number of years before and after the expansion. Event time zero is the rst year of the expansion. We omit event time -1, so all estimates are relative to the year before the expansion. The estimates are plotted along with their 95% con dence intervals. It is immediately clear that after accounting for di erences in linear pre-period trends there are no remaining pre-expansion di erences between treatment and control states, and that in treated states, the period following the expansion is associated with an abrupt increase in both actual and simulated eligibility. This is expected because of the way in which we assign treatment, and is evidence of a strong 33This variable is constructed using two potentially noisy variables, increasing the likelihood that the variable is measured with error. 34An exception is that we do not de-trend the NHDS payment data, given the limited number of pre-expansion years. 14 rst stage. Our estimates indicate that four years after the initial expansion, simulated eligibility had increased by 6.6 percentage points. Coe\u000ecient and standard error estimates are reported in Table 1. Appendix Figure A5 shows the results of a variety of additional analyses, with the baseline estimates shown as solid black circles. Alternative speci cations include models that eliminate the state-year controls (solid blue triangles), add region-year xed e ects (solid green square), and employ eligibility measures that have not been de-trended (hollow gray circle). The estimates barely change across these speci cations. Taken together, the results provide strong evidence that the timing of the expansions was not correlated with other location and time speci c factors. We also see that the estimates are comparable when the model is weighted by the number of rst generation (female) births, rather than the number of second generation births (hollow purple square), and when we estimate the model without including the control states (hollow red triangle).35 6.2 Medicaid Coverage at Birth Although Figure 5 con rms that eligibility increased in the wake of the expansions, we would not expect broader eligibility to translate into better infant health outcomes without a corresponding increase in program take-up. To investigate Medicaid take-up we estimate the event study model using NHDS data on Medicaid coverage at the time of birth. Figure 6 shows estimates based on equation (2), where the dependent variable is the fraction of hospitalized births that were covered by Medicaid. As in Figure 5, the pre-expansion estimates are close to zero, and there is a clear increase in coverage following the initial expansion.36Importantly, within four years of the initial expansion, the fraction of births covered by Medicaid had increased by 4.6 percentage points, which, when compared to the 6.6 percentage point increase in simulated eligibility, implies a 70% take-up rate among newly eligible mothers. In contrast to Figure 5, however, the increase in coverage phases in more slowly, suggesting that it took time for program take-up to fully respond. Given this, we anticipate a similar ramp-up pattern in the health estimates. 6.3 First Generation Estimates Having established the event study's validity, we use the same model to re-examine Currie and Gruber's rst generation results. Independent of our upcoming second generation analyses, here we make an important contribution to the literature by shedding light on the extent to which previous estimates of the expansions' e ects may have been confounded by the presence of other changes that were occurring within states. Figure 7 and Appendix Table A3 present our event study estimates of the expansions' e ects on the fraction of rst generation newborns who were low birthweight. The estimates strongly support Currie and Gruber's original ndings. Our pre-period estimates are close to zero and not distinguishable 35In Appendix Figure A6, we also document that our results are robust to an alternative measure of simulated eligibility that is based on a xed national sample where the data are pooled across all of our sample years (1975-1988). This version of simulated eligibility ensures that any changes in national population demographics over time are not driving variation in the simulated measure. Appendix Figure A7 shows that our estimates of the expansions' e ects on eligibility are robust to the inclusion of additional control variables that account for factors that might change between the time the mother ( rst generation) was born and the child (second generation) was born. We discuss these robustness checks in more detail when we examine second generation health outcomes in Section 6.4. 36Note, however, that as discussed in Section 5, the pre-expansion coe\u000ecients in this analysis are estimated using all available data, but necessarily include di erent treatment states at each event time (i.e. are \\unbalanced\") due to the limited years of pre-data available for the NHDS. This is not the case for any post-expansion coe\u000ecients. 15from each other, and there is an abrupt decrease in low birthweight in the treated states, compared to the control states, immediately following treated states' initial expansion. The magnitude of the low birthweight estimates grows over the post-expansion period, so that, four years post treatment, the incidence of low birthweight has declined by 0.25 percentage points (p <0.001), or 3.4 percent of the treated states' pre-period mean (Table 1).37When coupled with our estimated 6.6 percentage point increase in prenatal eligibility, the results suggest that a 10 percentage point increase in eligibility reduces the incidence of low birthweight in the rst generation by 0.37 percentage points, or about 5 percent. As a point of comparison, Currie and Gruber estimate that a 10 percentage point increase in eligibility led to a 2.6 percent decline in low birthweight. To interpret these e ects as causal, it must be the case that the timing of the expansions was unrelated to other factors that a ect prenatal health. For example, one might be concerned that a state's decision to expand was in uenced by the state of its economy. To check for this, we examine how our estimates change under the same set of alternative speci cations described in Section 6.1, which include models that eliminate the state-year controls or add region-year xed e ects, a version of the baseline model that does not remove linear pre-trends, and a version of the model that does not include the control states. Appendix Figure A8 Panel (a) shows that estimates are similar across the speci cations. The coe\u000ecient estimates during the post-period are smaller when we do not account for pre-existing linear trends, supporting the possibility that control states' early adoption of the expansion options may have already altered their infant health trajectories prior to the 1980s. Unsurprisingly, given the reduced sample size, con dence intervals are larger when we estimate the model without including the control states. Taken as a whole, our event study analysis bolsters the credibility of Currie and Gruber's landmark ndings. The new research design also provides insights into the time path of e ects, speci cally, that the expansions' impact on the rst generation's health took time to fully ramp up. A likely explanation is that it took time for pregnant women to learn about their eligibility and enroll in the program. Moreover, although improvements in the rst generation's birthweight are not a necessary pre-condition for the presence of second generation e ects, the results presented in Figure 7 allude to mothers' health at birth as a potential conduit, as previous studies have documented intergenerational linkages in low birthweight (e.g. Currie and Moretti, 2007).38 6.4 Second Generation Estimates Figure 8 shows the relationship between in utero Medicaid access and second generation outcomes. Focusing rst on birthweight (Panel (a)), we see evidence of an increase following the expansions. The magnitude of the e ect grows over time, and is 4.7 grams higher four years after expansion. Although the impacts on some of the other infant health outcomes are less precisely estimated, we see largely similar patterns, particularly at the lower end of the birthweight distribution (low birthweight and very low birthweight). We also see evidence of a decrease in very preterm births. As discussed in Section 5, 37Recall that for ease of presentation, we multiply all of the dichotomous variables by 100. 38We also consider the expansions' e ects on average birthweight and the incidence of very low birthweight, which are not examined in the original Currie and Gruber paper. Event study estimates and robustness analyses are provided in Panels (b) and (c) of Appendix Figure A8 and Appendix Table A3. The estimated e ects are suggestive of expansion related declines in very low birthweight. We do not examine changes in outcomes related to gestational length because prior to 1981 the birth certi cate records have a high rate of missing values for this variable. 16low birthweight and prematurity are of particular interest because they are closely linked to other early and later life health and cognitive outcomes. Also, low birthweight and preterm births are associated with maternal health characteristics that are known to have been a ected by the prenatal expansions (Institute of Medicine, 2017; Miller and Wherry, 2019).39We also see some evidence of improvements in small-for-gestational age, which is indicative of improvements in intrauterine growth. As with the rst generation estimates, Figure 9 shows that the second generation results are, for the most part, similar when we employ the speci cation checks described in Section 6.1. Excluding the state-year covariates, or adding region-year xed e ects does not change the results. The gure also documents similar patterns when we use di erent weights (mother rather than child cohort size). We see larger deviations from the baseline estimates when we do not account for pre-existing di erences in state trends (gray circles in the Figure). When we remove control states from our sample, the estimated intergenerational e ects become larger but more imprecise. Appendix Figure A9 shows the sensitivity of the estimates to additional sets of state-year controls. During the 1980s and 1990s, Medicaid coverage was also extended to older and higher income children.40 If the prenatal expansions we focus on are correlated with these other childhood expansions, then we might be erroneously attributing the observed health improvements among second generation infants to their mothers' in utero coverage when, in fact, the improvements result from mothers' increased Medicaid access in later childhood. Most studies estimate the impact of expanding children's access to Medicaid using a single index that aggregates eligibility across the length of childhood, without considering the connections between in utero and later childhood expansions. In Appendix Figure A10, we use the same event study framework to directly estimate the relationship between the prenatal expansions and the childhood expansions, and nd no evidence that they are correlated. Therefore, it is unsurprising that our second generation estimates are very similar when we add measures of later childhood eligibility to our baseline model (shown in the solid purple triangles in Appendix Figure A9). Appendix Figure A9 also documents that the results are similar when we control for mother's own eligibility during adulthood (open green circles), and when we control for the second generation's own prenatal eligibility (open pink triangles).41They are also una ected when we include the same set of state-year controls listed in Section 4 augmented with additional controls describing the generosity of welfare and access to family planning services, but measured in the child's year of birth rather than the mother's year of birth (shown in the solid blue squares).42 A remaining concern with event study estimates is that they may be biased in the presence of heterogeneous treatment e ects across expansion timing groups (Sun and Abraham, 2020). To alleviate this concern, we implement a new estimation method proposed by Callaway and Sant'Anna (2020) that is robust to heterogeneous treatment e ects across groups. Essentially, this approach avoids using earlier treated units as controls for later treated units (which are comparisons that can lead to biased 39For example, low birthweight has been linked to chronic hypertension, pre-pregnancy diabetes, and maternal obesity (Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Understanding Premature Birth and Assuring Healthy Outcomes, 2007). 40We describe these eligibility changes and how we construct our childhood eligibility measures in detail in Appendix Section A. 41See the discussion in Appendix Sections A and B for detailed information about how we construct these other eligibility variables. 42Additional details on these control variables are found in Appendix Section D. 17estimates). The results are shown in Appendix Figure A11.43Across all outcomes, the results are very similar to our baseline estimates.44This reassures us that the baseline event study results are robust to possible treatment e ect heterogeneity.45 Next, we verify that our results are not sensitive to our sample selection criteria. Appendix Figure A12 shows estimates based on a second generation sample of higher parity births. This sample gener- ates similar birthweight and low birthweight estimates as the main sample, but we no longer observe improvements in the incidence of very preterm or small-for-gestational-age. Tabulations we ran using pre-period data indicate that these outcomes are less common among higher order births, which may explain the di erence. Appendix Figure A13 shows what happens when we relax our baseline maternal age restriction from ages 15-28 to include births to older mothers (recall that this produces a sample that is unbalanced in maternal age). Again, the estimates are very similar to those produced by our main sample. Finally, we repeat our analysis including only children of foreign-born mothers, who are excluded in the main analysis, and who we assume were una ected by the rst generation prenatal expansions, since the rst generation was not born in the U.S. This placebo check is another way of addressing concerns about unexplained cohort x state speci c changes in infant health that are correlated with, but separate from, exposure to the prenatal expansions. We use the state of residence at the time of the child's birth to assign policy and control variables. The results from this analysis are found in Appendix Figure A14.46We do not detect any changes in infant health that correspond with the expansions' timing. 6.4.1 Magnitudes Our results show that the bene ts of prenatal Medicaid spill over onto later o spring. The 6.6 per- centage point increase in in utero eligibility generated by the 1980s expansions increased the second generation's average birthweight by a statistically signi cant 4.7 grams. This corresponds to an increase per newly eligible woman of about 71 grams (2 percent relative to the mean). Comparable estimates for low birthweight and very low birthweight are 1.8 percentage points and 1.2 percentage points. These are meaningfully-sized estimates; for example, the magnitude of the e ect of a mother's in utero el- igibility on her child's birthweight is a bit less than half of the observed gap in average birthweight between mothers with, and without, a high school degree at the beginning of our sample period. Of course, not everyone in the rst-generation who became eligible for Medicaid under the expan- sions actually received coverage. We therefore interpret the estimated e ects per newly eligible woman 43We implement the Callaway and Sant'Anna method using R code they provided. We use the same weighting as in our main analysis (by size of birth cohort) and cluster by state. We do not include control variables in this model to simplify comparisons across estimators. 44Speci cally, with this method, we nd that four years after the expansion average birthweight had increased by 4.2 grams, low birthweight had decreased by 0.09 percentage points, very low birthweight decreased by 0.08 percentage points, very preterm decreased by 0.05 percentage points, and small-for-gestation-age decreased by 0.14 percentage points. 45We note that in our application of this method, we continue to rely on the control states as a comparison group and that some of these states may have experienced similar expansions in eligibility (i.e. \\treatment\") prior to our study period. Our results should be interpreted with this caveat in mind. 46We note that the sample of births to foreign-born women is much smaller than the sample of births to U.S.-born women. For example, in 1980 there are an average of 19,000 births per state to US-born women, compared to 4,500 births to foreign-born women. Not surprisingly, the estimates for the sample of births to foreign-born women are accompanied by larger con dent intervals. 18as \\intent to treat\" estimates, where treatment is de ned as enrollment in the program. Assuming that the bene ts of Medicaid eligibility accrue only to those who were actually enrolled in utero , and that there were no e ects on those who were eligible but did not enroll, we can obtain the treatment e ect of Medicaid enrollment by dividing the estimated expansion e ects by the estimated increase in Medicaid coverage in Table 1 (4.6 percentage points in the fourth year of expansion). This calculation implies that among the o spring of women whose pregnant mothers enrolled in Medicaid, average birthweight increased by a little over 100 grams.47Similarly, the treatment e ect estimates for low birthweight and very low birthweight are 2.6 and 1.8 percentage points, respectively. While some of these treatment e ect estimates are large in comparison to our baseline means, it is important to note that the early expansions targeted very poor pregnant women for whom the incidence of low birthweight and very low birthweight would have been higher than in the full population. We can also compare our estimates of the expansions' e ects across generations. We note that the rst generation receives a direct and clearly de ned treatment, which is access to Medicaid coverage during the in utero period. In contrast, the second generation's treatment includes a bundle of biological and economic exposures experienced by their mother over the course of her life (as a result of her access to Medicaid) and subsequently passed on to her infant. It is therefore not clear ex ante which generation should experience larger e ects, or whether e ects must be present at birth in the rst generation in order for the second generation to be plausibly a ected. Comparing the estimates in columns 4 and 6 in Table 1 we see that the decline in low birthweight experienced by the second generation is about 48% as large as the e ect in the rst generation. This is consistent with Currie and Moretti (2007), who nd that the probability of being low birthweight is nearly 50 percent higher among children whose mothers were themselves born below the low birthweight threshold.48 Finally, we consider the implications for the program's return on investment. Currie and Gruber (1996b) report that the targeted expansions increased Medicaid spending per eligible woman by $450 (this cost is estimated in 1981 and we in ate to 2011 dollars). We compare this with the medical cost associated with lower birthweight averted in the second generation. Based on estimates provided in Almond et al. (2005), we calculate that each additional gram of birthweight reduces hospital costs by $8.29.49Our estimates suggest that rst generation eligibility increases average second generation birthweight by 71 grams, resulting in about $589 in savings per rst generation woman made eligible. Given the amount of time that has passed, we discount these cost savings back to the period of the initial Medicaid outlays (1981), using the discount rate recommended by the Department of Commerce for life-cycle studies (3%, see Lavappa and Kneifel, 2016). For this calculation, we assume cost savings accrue equally across all second generation birth years.50This calculation suggests that the expansions generated average cost savings of $287 per newly eligible woman, or more than 60% of the cost of the 47We obtain this estimate by dividing 4.768 grams by the 4.6 percentage point increase in Medicaid coverage. 48Other studies have estimated smaller intergenerational birthweight correlations (Black et al., 2007; Royer, 2009) but importantly, Currie and Moretti (2007) nd that poverty increases the transmission of low birthweight from mother to child. 49Almond et al. (2005) estimate that an additional gram of birthweight reduces hospital charges by $22 for infants in the 2000-2100 gram range in 2000 dollars, or $28.60 in 2011 dollars. Since hospital charges do not accurately re ect hospital resource costs (due to markups), we de ate this estimate using national charge-to-cost ratios (Bai and Anderson, 2015) to arrive at $8.29 per gram. 50We estimate cost savings for each second generation birth year from 1995 to 2017, since the rst expansions occurred in 1980, and these treated mothers were age 15 starting in 1995. 19initial investment.51Notably, this calculation is focused solely on bene ts that translate to the second generation, and ignores any improvements in the rst generation's health and human capital. The cal- culation also ignores medical cost savings that result from any second generation health improvements in later life that are tied to better health at birth, as well as improvements in later life earnings (and tax revenues), which have also been tied to birthweight (e.g. Black et al., 2007; Bharadwaj et al., 2018). It may also be reasonable to expect that health bene ts accruing to the rst two generations will continue to be passed on in the future, albeit incompletely. We could therefore model the intergenera- tional bene ts of the Medicaid program as an annuity that pays o once each generation. We assume that half of the bene t to the mother's generation is transmitted to the child, and then only half of that received bene t to the child's o spring, and so forth, such that the bene t of an investment decays exponentially across generations. Applying a 3% discount rate, and assuming that half of the health bene t is transmitted to the next generation (as we observe for low birthweight), we calculate that accounting for the intergenerational aspects of the program's e ects in this way results in estimated bene ts that are more than 30% higher than what would be observed if the analysis focused only on the rst generation.52 6.4.2 Additional Outcomes We can extend our analysis of the intergenerational e ects of the Medicaid expansions by looking at additional health indicators, including the presence of congenital anomalies, whether the birth was associated with any abnormal conditions, and the sex ratio at birth.53Congenital anomalies are more common among low birthweight and preterm infants, and have been linked to environmental factors that are often associated with low income, including poorer access to nutritious foods, health care and screening (World Health Organization, 2012). Similarly, some abnormal conditions such as NICU admission or surfactant replacement therapy could be indicative of underlying health conditions. Our examination of the sex ratio is motivated by the Trivers-Willard hypothesis, which suggests that, because male fetuses are more sensitive to negative health environments than female fetuses, improve- ments in maternal health might disproportionately reduce the number of in utero losses that are male (Trivers and Willard, 1973). The results of these analyses are provided in Appendix Figure A15 and lend further support to the hypothesis that the expansions' health bene ts extended beyond the treated generation. Although there is no evidence that the expansions a ected abnormal conditions at birth, the patterns of estimates for congenital anomalies and the sex ratio are similar to our main results. 51Using the discount rate recommended by the O\u000ece of Management and Budget of 0.5% instead, the discounted value of the bene ts is $520 (U.S. O\u000ece of Management and Budget, 2016). Details of these calculations are in the Appendix D.4. 52Speci cally, we assume the Medicaid investment generates a payo that falls by 50% in value and is paid out every 25 years. The present value of such a payo of size X would be: $X\u00021X n=0(0:5 (1 +r)25)n: Since0:5 (1+r)25<1 we can apply the rules for geometric series. Plugging in r= 0:03 for a 3% discount rate, this simpli es to $X\u00021.31. 53Examples of abnormal conditions include the provision of assisted ventilation, NICU admission, surfactant replace- ment therapy, antibiotics, seizures, or signi cant birth injury. 206.5 Mechanisms 6.5.1 Changes in Fertility or Maternal Characteristics What are the mechanisms generating these intergenerational spillovers? We investigate potential path- ways using additional information provided in the natality les. First, we consider changes in the rst-generation's fertility. The same (or related) biological processes that lead to improvements in the rst generation's health may have also a ected the rst generation's fecundity.54We also consider whether the Medicaid expansions led to changes in the composition of women giving birth: if children are a normal good, then Medicaid induced increases in the rst generation's earnings might also lead to increases in the desired number of children. On the other hand, improved economic opportunities might also lead to delays in childbearing (Brown et al., 2020).55 We explore these potential mechanisms in Figure 10. We estimate regressions similar to equation (2), replacing the dependent variable with measures of fertility or maternal characteristics (age, educa- tional attainment, marital status and race).56We nd no evidence that the Medicaid expansions lead to changes in fertility behavior; neither the likelihood of having a rst birth, nor the age at rst birth, are a ected by the expansions. In addition to their statistical insigni cance, the point estimates are very small (four years after the expansions, there is a 0.3% decrease in the rst birth rate and a 0.1% increase in age at rst birth, relative to the baseline means). We do see some evidence of changes in the characteristics of mothers, particularly with respect to race. The expansions are associated with an increase in the fraction of births to white mothers (0.7% relative to the pre-treatment mean) and a decrease in the fraction of births to Black mothers (3% relative to the pre-treatment mean). Since white infants tend to be healthier on average than Black infants, we consider whether the shift towards white births explains the expansions' apparent e ects on the second generation's health. To do this, we use the estimated e ects four years after the primary expansion. Table 2 shows that by year four the fraction of births to white mothers had increased by 0.54 percentage points, with a roughly similar decrease in the fraction of births to Black mothers.57A back-of-the-envelope calculation based on this compositional shift suggests that selection can explain, at most, about 30 percent of the overall e ect of the Medicaid expansion on average birthweight.58In 54We are not able to measure total fertility because we cannot observe most of our rst-generation cohorts throughout their childbearing years. 55Brown et al. (2020) estimate that each additional year of Medicaid eligibility from birth to age 18 is associated with a 1.2 percentage point reduction in the probability that a woman has her rst child by age 28, but the authors do not examine the e ect of in utero eligibility on fertility. 56Three of the outcomes analyzed in this section and the next (Section 6.5.2) { mother's educational attainment, prenatal care utilization, and race { were a ected by the introduction of the 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certi cate of Live Birth. This revised version replaced the 1989 version that was in use during the remainder of the period covered by our analyses. See Appendix Section D for more details on how we account for this change in our analyses. 57We appreciate that by year four the estimated e ects on racial composition are no longer statistically signi cant, but we use these estimates, which are very similar to the estimates in year 3, so as to be consistent with the focal event year used in the rest of the paper. 58If we apply these estimates to the race speci c averages for birthweight (3329.6 for children of white mothers and 3080.5 grams for children of Black mothers), we predict an increase in average birthweight of 1.24 grams due solely to the expansion's e ect on the racial composition of births (i.e. 3329.6*.005 - 3080.5*.005). This estimate is 26% of the program's estimated increase in the second generation's average birthweight of 4.7 grams in year 4 of the expansion. We also explore whether the observed changes in infant health persist when we restrict the sample of second generation births to white mothers (78%) of the sample. The results, shown in Appendix Figure A16, are very similar to those produced by the full baseline sample, indicating that selection based solely on race cannot explain all of our ndings. Unfortunately, 21addition, we re-estimate our main model directly controlling for mother's education, marital status, and race. The results, shown in Appendix Figure A17, are very similar to our baseline estimates. This is a strong indication that the observed health improvements are not driven by changes in the composition of mothers giving birth.59 6.5.2 Maternal Health and Behaviors Finally, we consider the role of maternal health and maternal health behaviors. The results of these analyses should be interpreted cautiously, as health conditions reported on birth certi cates are rela- tively limited and known to be under-reported (Lain et al., 2012).60Nevertheless, Appendix Figure A18 hints at the presence of biological pathways. We see suggestive evidence that the prenatal expansions reduced the incidence of medical risk factors among rst generation mothers, which include diabetes, chronic hypertension, pregnancy-related hypertension, and eclampsia. Consistent with rst-generation studies that document a positive link between early-life Medicaid and later-life metabolic health (e.g. Thompson, 2017; Miller and Wherry, 2019), the decline in maternal medical risk is driven by a reduc- tion in pregnancy-related hypertension. As described in Section 2, an improvement in this outcome would be expected to reduce the likelihood of giving birth to a low birthweight or preterm infant.61 7 Conclusion Social scientists have long known that children's outcomes are predicted by their parents' socioeconomic status (e.g. Mazumder, 2005; Solon, 1992), and recent research suggests that health plays an important role in the intergenerational transmission process (Halliday et al., 2020, 2021). The extent to which the impacts of policy-driven health investments spill over onto later generations has been largely unexplored, however. Understanding such e ects is important, both because it sheds light on how economic and health status are conferred across generations, and because it provides insights on the extent to which generationally persistent disadvantage can be ameliorated by policy choices. Furthermore, if safety net programs' bene ts extend beyond treated generations, then those bene ts need to be accounted for in order to accurately assess both net-costs to the government and their total value to recipients (direct and indirect). Neglecting policies' multi-generational e ects could result in dramatic undervaluation. In this paper, we provide new evidence that expanding health related services to low-income preg- nant women has persistent impacts on later generations' health. We introduce a new event study approach to analyze the e ects of the 1980s Medicaid expansions that exploits large, discrete jumps in state eligibility resulting from a combination of state policy choices and federal mandates. Using this new approach, we con rm previous studies' ndings that the targeted expansions generated im- small sample sizes impede further subgroup analyses. 59It is also possible that marital matching changed. Unfortunately, there is limited information about fathers' charac- teristics provided on birth certi cates (age, race, and Hispanic origin), which makes a direct examination of this hypothesis infeasible. 60We do not examine changes in alcohol or tobacco use due to limited availability on the birth certi cate records for all states and years. Alcohol use is only available through 2006. Information on tobacco use is available through 2008. This would only allow us to observe women through age 18 and age 20, respectively, if we were to balance the sample on mothers' age at birth. 61Surprisingly, we do see some evidence that Medicaid eligibility is associated with reductions in the use of prenatal care during pregnancy. If anything, this would lead us to expect worse infant health outcomes, and suggests that the e ects would be larger in the absence of this association. 22provements in the rst generation's birth outcomes. Then we document that this \\treated\" generation went on to give birth to healthier o spring. Our results do not appear to be driven by changes in the rst generation's fertility behavior or selection into childbearing. Instead, the positive spillovers likely re ect improvements in the rst generation's health and economic outcomes prior to giving birth. In particular, our analyses suggest that Medicaid-induced health gains among rst generation mothers may be an important underlying mechanism. Our study o ers a new perspective on health inequalities and the potential role for government intervention. Generational persistence in the impacts of early life environments suggest that historical di erences in fetal health conditions between advantaged and disadvantaged groups may undermine contemporaneous e orts to close health and economic gaps. At the same time, our results indicate that early life health investments have payo s that extend well beyond those that social policymakers usually consider. It is notable that Medicaid's second generation e ects are observed among cohorts who were born during roughly the same time frame for which recent studies by Aizer and Currie (2014) and Currie and Schwandt (2016a,b) document large improvements in child health and declining health inequality. Investigating a more complete range of program bene ts to later generations is an important goal of future work, and is critical in light of increasing debates about the e\u000ecacy of the U.S. safety net. 23References Aerts, L. and F.

Wherry A Mother's Eligibility at the Time of Birth and During Childhood A.1 Additional Details on Prenatal Eligibility and the 1980s Expansions In this section, we describe in more detail the pathways for prenatal Medicaid eligibility in our study period. At the beginning of this period, the primary pathway for Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women was through the AFDC program. To qualify for AFDC and its Medicaid bene t, women needed to be single parents, and therefore already have at least one dependent child, as well as meet the AFDC nancial eligibility criteria. The solid red line in Appendix Figure A19 tracks the fraction of women who were eligible for AFDC, and, therefore, quali ed for prenatal Medicaid coverage under this eligibility pathway in the event of a pregnancy.62 In addition, optional state AFDC and/or Medicaid eligibility programs expanded coverage to cer- tain groups that, while not speci cally targeting pregnant women, sometimes included pregnant women. Some states had AFDC-Unemployed Parent (AFDC-UP) programs, which allowed two-parent families in which the principal earner was unemployed to qualify for AFDC and Medicaid. In addition, optional state Ribico children programs allowed minors who met the nancial standards for AFDC, but did not qualify due to family structure, to receive Medicaid coverage. Finally, some states also had \\Medically Needy\" programs that provided coverage for individuals with incomes higher than AFDC levels but with large medical expenses. These three eligibility pathways are depicted in the next three lines on Appendix Figure A19 { the red dashed line, the yellow dashed line, and green dashed line, respectively. As may be seen here, these options predated the study period and there was little to no change in prenatal eligibility under these pathways by 1988. The focus of our paper is expansions in prenatal Medicaid eligibility that occurred starting in the 1980s under both state options and federal mandates. The 1980s saw a larger number of states exercising existing and new options to extend Medicaid eligibility, followed by two federal law changes that mandated Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women meeting the AFDC nancial requirements but not other AFDC eligibility criteria. We describe these changes that speci cally impacted prenatal eligibility next. First, a number of states o ered AFDC bene ts, and Medicaid coverage, to rst-time pregnant women provided that they met the nancial criteria for AFDC under an \"AFDC unborn\" option. However, the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981 (OBRA81) restricted participation for these women 62We construct this gure by calculating the fraction of women who would be eligible under each pathway in an additive fashion that re ects the order of eligibility pathways from the most to least restrictive on the gure (shown from lowest to highest lines on the graph). So, for example, we calculate the fraction of women eligible under AFDC rules only to plot the solid red line. Then we calculate how many more women would be eligible under the AFDC-UP rules to plot the dashed red line, and so on. 46until the sixth month of pregnancy. Following Currie and Gruber (1994), we considered this a source of prenatal eligibility if the state covered women starting during the rst trimester of pregnancy. The role of the AFDC unborn pathway on prenatal eligibility may be seen in Appendix Figure A19 in the light blue dashed line. Second, despite the OBRA81 restriction on AFDC eligibility for unborn children, states exercised alternative options under the Medicaid program (rather than AFDC) to cover pregnant women. A new \\Ribico unborn\" option introduced in 1982 allowed states to provide Medicaid coverage to unborn children, which meant coverage of pregnant women, whose family income quali ed them for AFDC. This is shown in the dark blue dashed line. Third, dating as far back as 1966, some states exercised additional options to cover women with a rst-time pregnancy, and pregnant women in two-parent families where the principal earner was unemployed, as long as the families met the nancial requirements for AFDC. We call these options \\pre-DEFRA state options\" since they e ectively cover the same groups as a federal mandate to cover these groups under the De cit Reduction Act (DEFRA, e ective October 1984). These state options are shown in the purple dashed line, and the DEFRA mandated changes are shown in the solid purple line. Fourth, some states also had optional rules in place to provide Medicaid coverage to all AFDC nancially eligible pregnant women, regardless of family structure or employment status. We refer to this as a \\pre-COBRA state option\", since the Consolidated Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act (COBRA, e ective July 1986) required states to extend Medicaid eligibility to all pregnant women meeting the AFDC nancial requirements. This state option is in the pink dashed line and the federal mandate is in the solid pink line. Finally, the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA86) authorized states to further expand eligibility for pregnant women with incomes up to the poverty line starting in April 1987 (i.e. \\income expansions\"). States were only beginning to take up this option at the very end of our study period. As may be seen in Appendix Figure A19 in the dashed red line, broad income expansions came in late during the period and were only adopted on a very small scale. Appendix Figure A20 displays the role of the di erent eligibility pathways separately for our treated and control states. The treated states experienced clear increases in the use of pre-DEFRA state options starting in 1980, followed by pre-COBRA state options and the introduction of the federal mandates. The control states were already exercising both pre-DEFRA and pre-COBRA state options throughout the 1970s, and only experienced very gradual increases in prenatal eligibility during the 1980s. A potentially important point for interpreting our results is that Medicaid eligibility sometimes comes with AFDC eligibility, so we may be estimating the impact of both AFDC and Medicaid. However, the policy changes we exploit in the treated states { pre-DEFRA and pre-COBRA options, DEFRA, and COBRA { only expanded eligibility for Medicaid and not AFDC. Additionally, while control states experience a decline in AFDC Unborn between 1980 and 1982, which also means a reduction in AFDC, we do not believe our results are generated by this change, due to the fact that we get very similar results when we omit all the control states in Appendix Figure 9. Each option and the sources for the relevant eligibility rules are listed below. We relied heavily on the Appendix of Currie and Gruber (1994) for information about the di erent options for Medicaid 47eligibility during this period, as well as the sources used by these authors. We supplemented this information with additional sources to compile rules for earlier years. 1. AFDC and AFDC-UP: AFDC program parameters and information on the presence of state AFDC-UP programs for the 1975-1996 years were taken from the Urban Institute's Transfer Income Model, version 3 (TRIM3). Using these parameters, we were able to calculate whether a family was eligible for either program based on state rules, monthly total family income, and family size. For the AFDC-UP program, we assume that a two-parent family is eligible if the state had a program and their maximum hours worked were less than 1200 in the prior year. Following Currie and Gruber (1994), we adjust family income for minors residing with their parents by subtracting the needs standard for a family of that size. For adults ages 19 and older residing with their parents, we do not include parents' income in the eligibility determination. 2. Ribico children and unborn options: Information on Ribico children programs for 1988 forward were drawn from materials provided by Bruce Meyer and used in Meyer and Rosenbaum (2001). Rules for the 1985-1986 years were drawn from the TRIM3 database and for 1983 from the 1983 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)'s Analysis of State Medicaid Program Character- istics report. State rules regarding coverage of unborn children under Ribico programs, which meant coverage of pregnant women whose income quali ed them for AFDC, were taken from the 1983 HCFA report as well. We were unable to locate earlier records of these state Ribico programs. We therefore assume that the same Ribico children provisions were in place during earlier years, with the exception of the unborn children, which was established in 1982.63 3. Medically Needy: State Medically Needy thresholds as a percent of poverty were drawn from TRIM3 (for years 1985 forward), the 1981, 1983, 1984, and 1986 Medicare and Medicaid Data Books issued by the Health Care Financing Administration, and the 1977 and 1979 Data on the Medicaid Program reports. For the in between years when we were unable to locate Medically Needy rules, we impute the values as the average of the thresholds for the years book-ending the given year. For 1975, we assume the rules were the same as those in place in 1976. Following the description of state Medically Needy programs in these sources, we include all pregnant women who were categorically eligible for state Medicaid programs and compare their net income to the Medically Needy income thresholds for their family size. 4. AFDC-unborn: Prior to OBRA 1981, many states o ered AFDC coverage for rst-time pregnant women. Following Currie and Gruber (1996b), we consider this as a pathway to Medicaid if the state covered a woman starting in her rst trimester. Information on the presence of these programs and whether states included the unborn child in the bene t calculation were taken from the 1974, 1976, 1978, 1980, 1981 Characteristics of State Plans for Aid to Families with Dependent Children reports published by the Department of Health and Human Services. For 63In 1982, a new Medicaid eligibility category was established for pregnant women by Congress. This is described by Sara Rosenbaum in her 1983 report \\The Prevention of Infant Mortality: The Unful lled Promise of Federal Health Programs for the Poor.\" Prior to this new category, it appears that states were able to cover unborn children under the regular Ribico children program, but we were unable to nd any additional information about states doing so. 48any policy changes that occurred between reports, we use the midpoint of the dates reported as the implementation date. 5. Pre-DEFRA state option 1: Separately, a number of states o ered Medicaid coverage to rst- time pregnant women from the point of medical veri cation provided that they met the nancial criteria for AFDC. Information on this option for all states and the implementation dates are taken from Hill (1987). 6. Pre-DEFRA state option 2: Some states o ered Medicaid coverage to pregnant women in two- parent families if the principal earner was unemployed and the family met the AFDC nancial eligibility criteria. Information on this option for all states and the implementation dates are also from Hill (1987). 7. Pre-COBRA state option: Some states o ered Medicaid coverage to all pregnant women meet- ing the nancial eligibility criteria for AFDC. Information on this option for all states and the implementation dates are also from Hill (1987). A.2 Mother's Childhood Eligibility In addition to changes in prenatal eligibility, eligibility for children who were not traditionally eligible for AFDC and with family income levels exceeding AFDC cuto s was also expanded starting in the 1980s. These eligibility changes were rst introduced as state options and later by federal mandate. The eligibility changes were rst more \\targeted\" (following the terminology rst used by Currie and Gruber, 1996b) to the lowest income children { those whose families met the income and resource eligibility criteria for AFDC but who did not otherwise meet the family structure requirements for the AFDC program. The later \\broad\" eligibility expansions extended eligibility to children with incomes that exceeded the AFDC eligibility levels, and are often referred to as poverty-related expansions. Eligibility levels for children continued to grow during the 1990s as Medicaid eligibility changes continued to be phased in, and later through the 2000s under optional state expansions to higher income children under the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Given these concurrent changes in childhood eligibility, we examine the correlation between the mother's in utero and childhood eligibility in the paper. We also control for her simulated childhood eligibility as a robustness check. Each eligibility pathway and the sources for the relevant eligibility rules are listed below. For the years 1975 to 1996, Medicaid eligibility is calculated under the eligibility rules for the AFDC and the AFDC-Unemployed Parents (AFDC-UP) programs, optional state programs (e.g. Ribico children, Medically Needy described above), and both targeted and poverty-related expansions for children. For the years 1997 to 2006, public eligibility under Medicaid and state Children's Health Insurance Programs (CHIP) is calculated under the rules for poverty-related Medicaid expansions and additional Medicaid expansions or new state programs under CHIP. Sources for eligibility rules under pathways related to AFDC, AFDC-UP, Ribico children, and Medically Needy programs are listed in Section A.1. Information on the poverty-related Medicaid expansions, and later CHIP-related expansions in eligibility by state, including the population targeted, implementation date, and income cuto s were compiled from the sources below. Income disregard rules 49by state and year were downloaded from the Urban Institute's TRIM3 database. \u000fMaternal and CHIP Programs: December 1998 to June 1999, prepared by Vernon K.

Eligibility was estimated using the year of the eligibility determination and family characteristics, including family structure, income, and information on parental employment. We calculate eligibility during each month of a given year and use the average monthly eligibility level for that year. We used the 1977-1989 Annual Social and Economic Supplements (ASEC) of the Current Popu- lation Survey (CPS) to estimate mother's eligibility for public health insurance at the time of birth which is our measure of prenatal eligibility. This measure was estimated using women ages 15-44 and determining their eligibility in event of a pregnancy by state and year during the period 1975-1988. To construct a simulated eligibility measure, we drew a national sample of 3,000 women ages 15-44 for each year and estimated eligibility for this sample using state-speci c eligibility rules during that year. Not all states are identi able in the 1976 CPS, so, to estimate eligibility for the 1975 year, we relied on the CPS for next year (i.e. 1977 year of data) and de ate dollar values using the CPI-U.64 We used the 1977-2007 ASEC to estimate eligibility for childhood Medicaid coverage by single year of age for cohorts born between 1975-1988. We assumed that birth year was equal to calendar year minus age in order to estimate eligibility by birth year x age x state. These estimates were then added across ages 1-18 in order to create a measure of cumulative childhood eligibility for each birth year by state. To construct a simulated eligibility measure, we used a national sample of 1,000 children of each age for each year and estimated eligibility for this sample using state-speci c eligibility rules during that year. B Mother's Adult Eligibility When examining public health insurance eligibility for the rst generation during adulthood, we con- sider eligibility for low-income parents under Medicaid Section 1931 criteria in each state, as well as expanded eligibility for health care coverage for parents and childless adults under both waiver and 64In the 1976 CPS, 38 states cannot be separately identi ed but share state codes with other states. 50state-funded programs. We also consider expansions under the A ordable Care Act.

Federal law for family coverage under Section 1931 requires that states disregard at least $90 of earned income per month when assessing Medicaid eligibility (Birnbaum 2000). In 2000, most states were using this minimum earnings disregard in eligibility determinations (Broaddus et al. 2001). Therefore, we chose to apply this rule for all states for the years 1998-2013. For 2014-2017, following the implementation of the A ordable Care Act Medicaid expansions, a standard disregard of ve percentage points of the federal poverty level is built into the eligibility thresholds. We construct a measure of average cumulative adult Medicaid simulated eligibility from age 19 to the age we observe women at child birth by state and birth year cohort. This measure is constructed using a sample of adults ages 19-28 from the Annual Social and Economic Supplements (ASEC) of the Current Population Survey (CPS). We use a random national sample of 1,000 adults per year of age and survey year and estimated eligibility for this sample using state-speci c eligibility rules during that year. 51C Second Generation's Own In Utero Eligibility at the Time of Birth To calculate the second generation child's own in utero eligibility (which is the same as the rst gener- ation mother's prenatal eligibility at the time of second generation child's birth), we use the eligibility rules under Medicaid Section 1931 eligibility, poverty-related Medicaid expansions for pregnant women, expanded Medicaid rules authorized under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, and separate state pro- grams created under the State Children's Health Insurance Program over the period 1989-2017. Income eligibility cuto s by state and year were compiled from the sources listed under Appendix Sections A and B. We use the 1990-2018 Annual Social and Economic Supplements (ASEC) of the Current Population Survey (CPS) to estimate mother's simulated eligibility for public health insurance at the time of infant's birth. This measure of in utero eligibility was estimated using women ages 15-44. We drew national sample of 3,000 women ages 15-44 for each year between 1990-2017 and estimated eligibility in event of a pregnancy for this sample using state-speci c eligibility rules during that year. D Additional Details on Data Construction D.1 State-Year Control Variables In our main analyses we include controls for state economic conditions, demographics, safety net policy, and abortion policy based on the state and year of mother's birth ( rst generation). These controls are described in detail below. In additional robustness checks, we include these same variables, as well as several additional variables also described below, at the time of the second generation's birth. We include the following demographic controls: the fraction of the state population between the ages of 0-4, 5-17, 18-24, 25-44, 44-64; state fraction of Black race and claiming a race other than white or Black; state fraction with a high school degree, some college, college or more. These were constructed by the authors using the ASEC. We include the following economic controls: state median household income (from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) and unemployment rate (from the U.S. Census Bureau). We include maximum welfare bene ts at the time of the mother's birth. In addition, in certain speci cations, we include the following measures of welfare generosity at the time of the second generation's birth: state welfare family cap; whether the state had an EITC program, whether the state had implemented TANF.

In addition, in certain speci cations, we also include the following at the time of the second gener- ation's birth: mandatory delay for abortion laws; income based and duration based Medicaid family planning waivers; state mandate for private health insurance coverage of contraceptives; an indicator that emergency contraceptives can be provided over-the-counter; an indicator that minor may consent to contraceptive services in all or limited circumstances.

D.2 Additional Details on Birth Certi cate Revision The variables used to examine mother's (i.e. rst generation's) educational attainment, prenatal care utilization, and race were a ected by the introduction of the 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certi - cate of Live Birth, which replaced the 1989 revision that was in use during the remainder of the period covered by our analyses. State adoption of the revision is staggered over the period. By January 2011, 36 states and the District of Columbia had implemented the revised birth certi cate. These states represent 83 percent of births to U.S. residents (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011). Starting in 2011, the CDC no longer made available certain data items from the unrevised birth cer- ti cate, including maternal education and prenatal care utilization. As a result, information on these variables is incomplete, and only available for states that had fully implemented the 2003 revision. Fourteen states in 2011, 12 states in 2012, 9 states in 2013, 3 states in 2014, and 2 states in 2015 have 53incomplete information for these data elds. By 2016 all states had implemented the revised birth certi cate. In addition, even when the data elds are available, these measures are not considered comparable before and after the 2003 revision. Prior to the revision, mother's education was classi ed into years of education: no formal education, 1-8 years of elementary school, 1-4 years of high school, 1-4 years of college, and 5 or more years of college. The 2003 revision classi ed mother's education into the following categories: 8th grade or less; 9th through 12th grade with no diploma; high school graduate or GED completed; some college credit, but not a degree; associate degree; Bachelor's degree; Master's degree; and, doctorate or professional degree. In our analyses, we code high school or less as having at least 4 years of high school under the 1989 revision, and being a high school graduate or having a GED completed under the 2003 revision. In addition, changes occurred in information collected on mother's race with the 2003 revision including more detailed race categories. Also, beginning in 2003, states had the option of allowing the report of multiple race categories. These multiple race combinations are bridged to a single race category for comparability to other reporting areas and years. We address the incomparability of these measures after the birth certi cate revision by including in regressions for which maternal education, race, or prenatal care utilization are dependent variables or used to de ne subgroups, a measure of the fraction of birth records in that cell (mother's birth year x mother's state of birth) with a revised birth certi cate. Additionally, for regressions with maternal race as a dependent variable or for which race was used to de ne subgroups, we also include a control for the fraction of birth records in each cell that allowed for the reporting of multiple race categories. D.3 Identifying Labor and Delivery Hospitalizations in the National Hospital Dis- charge Survey We identify hospitalizations related to labor and delivery in the National Hospital Discharge survey using ICD-9 diagnosis and procedure codes and following the method validated in Kuklina et al. (2008). First, we code all visits with a diagnosis code starting with \\V27\" (corresponding to live or still births) or \\650\" (normal delivery) as discharges related to labor and delivery. Second, if the rst three or four digits of the procedure code falls in the subsequent list, we classify the hospitalization as being a labor are associated with di erent obstetrics procedures. Finally, we exclude discharges with a diagnosis code that indicates an ectopic pregnancy or abortive outcome. D.4 Additional Details on Discounting of Long-Run Bene ts To calculate the discounted value of the second generation bene ts, we estimate that in 2011 $s the value of the bene ts from increasing birthweight by 71 grams (our estimated change in birthweight for each newly eligible woman in the rst generation) is $589. We then apply this value of the bene t to each second generation birth cohort, and calculate the discounted value of this bene t between 1981 and each birth cohort. We have chosen 1981 as the reference point because this is the year for which we have estimated Medicaid costs (Currie and Gruber, 1996b). We then take the average discounted value across second generation birth cohorts to generate a summary measure. We do this for two di erent discount rates: 1) 0.5%, which is the discount rate recommended for 20-year studies by the 54O\u000ece of Management and Budget (U.S. O\u000ece of Management and Budget, 2016), and 2) 3%, which is the discount rate recommended for life-cycle studies by the Department of Commerce (Lavappa and Kneifel, 2016). 55Figure A1: Trends in Actual and Simulated Prenatal Medicaid Eligibility, 1975 to 1988 .1.12.14.16.18.2Fraction Eligible In Utero1975198019851990Birth CohortPrenatal Eligibility, ActualPrenatal Eligibility, Simulated Notes: Authors' calculation from the Current Population Survey and Medicaid eligibility rules.
