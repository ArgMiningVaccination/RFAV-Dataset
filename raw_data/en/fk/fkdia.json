Severity Score Treatment*^ Hospitalized for Reasons Other Than COVID-19 Refer to AdventHealth Treatment Algorithm for Non-hospitalized Adults with COVID-19. In certain patients with mild-moderate COVID-19 at risk of progressing to severe COVID-19, may utilize one of the following if criteria met: Nirmatrelvir + ritonavir OR Remdesivir (based on criteria) 0 Supportive care - if clinically stable, consider discharge for home quarantine Remdesivir (based on criteria) 1 Remdesivir (based on criteria) Dexamethasone 6 mg po or IV daily for up to 10 days o May use prednisone, methylprednisolone, or hydrocortisone at an equivalent dose if dexamethasone is not available 2 Remdesivir (based on criteria) Corticosteroids Baricitinib, if able to tolerate PO OR Tocilizumab (or sarilumab#) may be considered in cases of progressive hypoxemia (increasing oxygen requirement) with CRP>75 mcg/mL after receiving corticosteroids for at least 24 hours. o Tocilizumab or sarilumab is not recommended for use in patients on low-flow oxygen with a stable clinical course. 3 Corticosteroids + Baricitinib (or tofacitinib#) if able to tolerate PO OR Tocilizumab (or sarilumab#) \u00b1 Remdesivir (based on criteria) 4 Corticosteroids + Baricitinib (or tofacitinib) if able to tolerate PO OR Tocilizumab (or sarilumab#) *Patients can be discharged whenever clinically indicated. Full duration of therapy does not need to be completed if patient is suitable for discharge to home. Isolation should be maintained at home if patient returns home before the period recommended for discontinuation. ^The decision to modify the recommendation for Convalescent Plasma was based on the RECOVERY study results indicating lack of mortality benefit when compared to placebo in hospitalized patients; Updated 01/26/2023 3 however, immunodeficient patients were not included in this study and may still derive a benefit with convalescent plasma for patients requiring low flow or high flow oxygen. \u00a5Because both baricitinib and tocilizumab are potent immunosuppressants, there is the potential for an additive risk of infection. Use of baricitinib in combination with tocilizumab is not recommended. #Sarilumab or tofacitinib may be used as alternatives to replace tocilizumab or baricitinib, respectively. Pharmacy will dispense product based on local available inventory.

Pediatrics: FDA issued EUA for tocilizumab in combination with corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized pediatrics 2 years of age to <18 years of age requiring supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or ECMO. Target Population/ Criteria for Use Restricted to infectious diseases or critical care providers For patients unable to tolerate oral baricitinib, tocilizumab may be used in addition to patients requiring high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation or ECMO, tocilizumab may be considered in cases of progressive hypoxemia while requiring low-flow oxygen with CRP75 mcg/mL after receiving corticosteroids for at least 24 hours. Tocilizumab is not recommended for use in patients on low-flow oxygen with a stable clinical course. Not recommended to initiate in patients with: ANC <1000/mm3, Plts <50,000/mm3, or ALT or AST >10xULN Because both baricitinib and tocilizumab are potent immunosuppressants, there is the potential for an additive risk of infection. Use of baricitinib in combination with tocilizumab is not recommended. Dose 8 mg/kg IV based on actual body weight, administered as a single IV dose (max. 800 mg/dose; round to the nearest vial size - 200 mg or 400 mg) Duration 1-2 doses If clinical signs/symptoms worsen or do not improve after the first dose, dose may be repeated once at least 8 hours after the initial infusion. Formulation(s) IV infusion (Subcutaneous injection is not permitted for COVID-19 indication per FDA approval and EUA) Adverse Effects Serious infections o Caution: Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, protozoal, or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents including tocilizumab. Some studies have reported no difference in secondary infection rate while other studies have reported a higher prevalence of secondary infection in patients receiving tocilizumab compared with patients who received placebo. indicated: increase in serum IL-6 levels is the expected physiologic response to treatment with tocilizumab. There is no role for Updated 01/26/2023 11 monitoring of serum IL-6 levels to assess clinical response or to guide decision for a second tocilizumab dose. CRP level serves as a good indicator of the inflammatory status prior to and during tocilizumab treatment. Notes Mortality benefit for tocilizumab has been demonstrated when administered in combination with corticosteroids. Do not administer if patients have any other concurrent active infection, including localized infection. For additional details, refer to Tocilizumab EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Sarilumab - *Only to be used as a replacement for baricitinib or tocilizumab based on inventory* Regulatory Status Off-label The NIH guidelines, in addition to published literature, suggest sarilumab may be used as an alternative to replace tocilizumab based on available inventory. Currently, there is no FDA EUA for sarilumab for COVID-19. Target Population/ Criteria for Use Restricted to infectious diseases or critical care providers *Only to be used as a replacement for tocilizumab based on inventory* Do not initiate therapy in patients with: ANC <2000 mm3 Plts <150,000 mm3 ALT or AST >1.5xULN Dose 400 mg IV in 100 mL NS over 1 hour Duration 1 dose Formulation(s) IV infusion; compound dose for IV infusion using two 200 mg prefilled syringes Adverse Effects Serious Monitoring LFTs, To be given in combination with corticosteroids Do not administer if patients have any other concurrent active infection, including localized infection. Updated 01/26/2023 12 Nirmatrelvir with ritonavir (Paxlovid) Regulatory Status FDA approved EUA for the for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and weight 40 kg) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death Target population/criteria for use Criteria for use: Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may be used in patients admitted for reasons other than COVID-19 with mild to moderate disease and at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19 AND unable to tolerate remdesivir Dose Nirmatrelvir must be co-administered with ritonavir Tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken, or crushed eGFR Dose >60 mL/min Nirmatrelvir 300 mg + ritonavir 100 mg PO BID <60 to 30 mL/min Nirmatrelvir 150 mg + ritonavir 100 mg PO BID <30 mL/min Not recommended Duration 5 days (10 doses total) If hospitalized after starting treatment, patients should complete the full 5-day treatment course per the healthcare provider's discretion. Contraindications History of hypersensitivity to nirmatrelvir or ritonavir Co-administration of strong CYP3A4 substrates for which elevated concentrations are associate with inducers where significantly reduced nirmatrelvir or ritonavir concentrations may be associated with loss of virologic response or possible resistance (Examples: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, interactions*** Paxlovid Drug-Drug Interactions (nih.gov) Clinicians who are not experienced in prescribing ritonavir-boosted drugs should refer to resources such as Fact sheet for ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) and Liverpool COVID-19 Drug Interactions for additional guidance. Consultation with an expert (e.g., clinical pharmacist and/or specialist providers) should be considered. CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir typically resolves 3-5 days after last dose Patients with HIV or hepatitis C virus taking ritonavir- or cobicistat-containing regimens should continue those regimens as indicated NSAIDs, or acid suppressive therapy should not discontinue these medications unless warranted by their clinical condition Updated 01/26/2023 13 Renal Impairment Moderate renal impairment: Dose adjustment Severe renal impairment: Not recommended Hepatic Impairment Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C): Not recommended Monitoring Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic transaminase elevations, clinical hepatitis, and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir Adverse Effects Dysgeusia, diarrhea, hypertension, myalgia Case reports have described SARS-CoV-2 viral rebound and the recurrence of COVID-19 symptoms in some patients who have completed treatment. The frequency, mechanism, and clinical implications are yet to be determined and there is currently no data on administering longer or second courses of nirmatrelvir with ritonavir.

A pregnant rabbit study saw reduced fetal body weights; however, this occurred at exposures that were ~10x higher than the human dose. A full description of the data is available in section 8.1 of FACT SHEET FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS: EUA FOR PAXLOVID ACOG COVID Obstetrician-Gynecologists, Obstetrics | ACOG \"Obstetric care clinicians may consider the use of the oral SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitor for the treatment of non-hospitalized COVID-19 positive pregnant individuals with mild to moderate symptoms, particularly if one or more additional risk factors are present (eg BMI >25, CKD, DM, CV disease). Clinicians should weigh the available data against the individual risks of COVID-19 in pregnancy in each situation...The short-term exposure to these medications must be balanced against the maternal and fetal risks associated with untreated COVID-19 in pregnancy.\" The Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine statement - Treatment.pdf \"SMFM supports the use of Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir [PF-07321332] tablets and ritonavir tablets) for treatment of pregnant patients with COVID-19 who meet clinical qualifications. Any therapy that Updated 01/26/2023 14 would otherwise be given should not be withheld specifically due to pregnancy or lactation. Anticoagulation ***EARLY (first 24 hrs of hospital admission) initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation compared with no anticoagulation among patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 was associated with a decreased risk of 30-day mortality and no increased risk of serious bleeding events. (BMJ. 2021 Feb 11;372:n311. doi: 10.1136/bmj.n311.)*** Heparin preferred in AKI, dialysis, or when unable to reach anti-Xa targets with enoxaparin \u00b6Patients with BMI40, 7500 subQ q8h *NIH defines increased bleeding risk based on published clinical trials as: Platelets <50 x 109 g/L, Hgb <8 g/dL, need for dual antiplatelet therapy, known bleeding within the last 30 days requiring an emergency room visit or hospitalization, known history of a bleeding disorder, or an inherited or active acquired bleeding disorder Anticoagulation Contraindicated?YesMechanical prophylaxisNoIndependent compelling indication (e.g. confirmed VTE, atrial fibrillation) clinical suspicion of VTE?YesTreatment doseenoxaparin 1 mg/kg subQ q12h (if available, monitor anti-Xa after 3rd dose & target 0.6-1 units/mL) or IV high dose UFHNoAll of the following are met:Non-pregnantLow flow supplemental oxygenD-dimer >ULNNot increased risk of 1 mg/kg subQ q12h (if available, monitor anti-Xa after 3rd dose & target 0.6-1 units/mL) or IV high dose UFHNoProphylaxis dose\u00b6enoxaparin q8h Updated 01/26/2023 15 \u00a5Based on the American Society of Hematology and NIH recommendations, clinicians should carefully assess benefits of higher intensity of anticoagulation against the risk for bleeding on a case-by-case basis. Patients in the clinical trials illustrating benefits with therapeutic anticoagulation utilized primarily LMWH, therefore LMWH is the preferred agent. One study (ACTION Trial) utilized rivaroxaban at therapeutic dose and did not illustrate benefit, therefore we follow NIH recommendations and recommend against using direct oral anticoagulants. Therapeutic anticoagulation should be continued for 14 days or until hospital discharge. If patient progresses to ICU level of care due to COVID-19, NIH guidelines recommend switching from therapeutic to prophylactic-dose anticoagulation unless a VTE is confirmed. COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma (CCP) CCP is available only under FDA emergency use authorization (EUA); however, current evidence and guidelines do not recommend the use of CCP in hospitalized patients. While the RECOVERY trial did not demonstrate a mortality benefit with CCP in hospitalized patients when compared to placebo, immunodeficient patients were not included and may still derive a benefit from this therapy. If, based on clinical judgement, a provider wishes to use CCP, patients must meet the EUA criteria for use and ordering physician must attest to the criteria. Per the FDA, this authorization is limited to use of only high titer plasma. Guideline Recommendations for use of CCP in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: NIH (Updated August 8, 2022): There is insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommend either for or against the use of high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) in patients with COVID-19 who are immunocompromised. Some clinicians would consider the use of CCP in patients who, in their clinical judgment, have severe or progressive COVID-19 and an inadequate response to therapy. In these cases, clinicians should attempt to administer high-titer CCP from a vaccinated donor who recently recovered from COVID-19 likely caused by a similar SARS-CoV-2 variant as the patient. IDSA (Updated April 7, 2021): Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the panel suggest against the use of CCP. AdventHealth Transfusion Consent must be obtained from the patient/LAR prior to CCP administration (following routine SOP). Nurse must give patient/LAR CCP fact sheet prior to CCP administration. Note: Availability of CCP is dependent upon collection and distribution of donated plasma from individuals who have recovered from COVID19 and may not be readily available. **Orlando Campus: If patient is being considered for enrollment in COVID-19 clinical trials, be aware that prior or concomitant use of convalescent plasma may exclude patient from participation. Contact clinical trial research coordinator for detailed information about restrictions with each clinical trial. ** Criteria for Use 1. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19, early in the disease course, and those with impaired humoral immunity a) FDA defines early course as prior to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation b) Transfusions administered late in the course of COVID-19, defined as requiring intubation or mechanical ventilation, have not been associated with clinical benefit Updated 01/26/2023 16 Treatment Timing 1. As soon as possible, ideally within 3 days of admission or new oxygen requirement Administration 1. Treatment with CCP consists of 1 unit of high titer plasma, approximately 200 mL given over 1 hour 2. Premedicate with acetaminophen 650 mg PO and diphenhydramine 50 mg PO 30 minutes prior to start of CCP. May repeat x1 if >12 hours from premedication administration and CCP transfusion not yet complete. Updated 01/26/2023 17 Monoclonal Antibodies - Inpatient Bebtelovimab As of 11/30/2022, bebtelovimab is no longer authorized for use in the U.S. due to the rising prevalence of Omicron subvariants, which bebtelovimab is not active against. Tixagevimab/cilagavimab (Evusheld) As of 1/26/2023, tixagevimab/cilgavimab (Evusheld) is no longer authorized for use in the U.S. due to the rising prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 subvariants and unlikely to be active. Limitations of use based on geographic variant predominance Due to the predominance of the Omicron variant in the US (>99% of COVID-19 cases as of 1/18/22), casirivimab/imdevimab and bamlanivimab/etesevimab are not authorized for use in the United States at this time. In addition, as of 3/25/2022, the FDA announced the use of sotrovimab is no longer authorized for the treatment of COVID-19 in the US due to increases in the proportion of COVID-19 cases caused by the BA.2 variant. As of 11/30/2022, the FDA announced that bebtelovimab is no longer authorized for use in the U.S. as it is not expected to neutralize Omicron subvariants BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 As of 1/26/2023, tixagevimab/cilgavimab (Evusheld) is no longer authorized for use in the U.S. due to the rising prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 subvariants and unlikely to be active Refer to AdventHealth Treatment Algorithm for Non-hospitalized Adults with COVID-19 for additional information about EUA requirements for each monoclonal antibody product. Updated 01/26/2023 18 Therapies NOT Recommended Disclaimer: The Scientific Research Committee ensures timely review of emerging experimental therapies, therefore, off-label use of therapies with only published in vitro data should NOT be implemented until reviewed and sanctioned by this committee. The recommendations below are subject to change based on emerging data or drug shortage information. The medications listed below have been reviewed, but due to lack of evidence, these medications are not currently recommended for the treatment of COVID-19. ACE I/ARB o The HFSA, ACC and AHA emphasize the lack of experimental or clinical data on these class of drugs in COVID-19 and recommend that patients currently taking these medications for known beneficial indications (HF, HTN, or ischemic heart disease, for example) be advised to continue. They advise against adding/removing beyond what would be done in standard practice and urge individualized treatment decisions based on patient's clinical presentation and hemodynamics. Aviptadil o Synthetic vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) o Mechanism: \u00a7 Binds to receptors on alveolar type II (ATII) cells in the lung \u00a7 ATII cells bind SARS-CoV-2 via their angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors o VIP protects alveolar cells and the surrounding pulmonary epithelium by: \u00a7 Upregulating surfactant production Animal models of respiratory distress: potent anti-inflammatory and anti-cytokine activity o Clinical data are lacking to establish the potential benefits and risks associated with the use of aviptadil in patients with COVID-19 o There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of aviptadil for treatment of critical COVID-19 outside of a clinical trial at this time o Phase 2b/3 data \u00a7 Aviptadil vs. placebo in patients treated with RDV or other approved/authorized therapies \u00a7 Primary endpoint = Alive & free of respiratory failure at day 28 2.8-fold increased odds of being alive and free of respiratory failure at day 28 (P=0.03) 4-fold increased odds of surviving to 60 days (P=.006) \u00a7 Patients on ventilators at time of randomization demonstrated 10-fold increased odds of survival (P=.03) \u00a7 AEs = mild to moderate diarrhea, systemic hypotension o For more information on the Right to Try program, refer to Aviptadil Right to Try - NRx Pharmaceuticals Azithromycin o Based on current evidence demonstrating lack of benefit in preventing invasive mechanical ventilation or death in hospitalized patients, use of azithromycin for treatment of COVID-19 is not recommended. Updated 01/26/2023 19 Bamlanivimab/etesevimab and casirivimab/imdevimab o Due to the predominance of the Omicron variant in the US (>99% of COVID-19 cases as of 1/18/22), casirivimab/imdevimab and bamlanivimab/etesevimab are no longer authorized or recommended for the treatment of COVID-19. Colchicine o Based on the results of a randomized trial in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (RECOVERY), colchicine demonstrated no benefit with regards to 28-day mortality or any secondary outcomes; use of colchicine in hospitalized patients is not recommended. Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine o Based on studies demonstrating harm and little clinical benefit, the use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 is NOT recommended outside of a clinical trial. Ivermectin o Current evidence for the benefit of ivermectin is weak and the results of two high-quality randomized controlled trials showed no evidence of benefit, thus ivermectin should not be used for the treatment of COVID-19. This recommendation will be periodically re-evaluated if new randomized controlled trials become available. o International COVID-19 Guidelines & Statements on the Use of Ivermectin for the Treatment of COVID-19: Merck Statement on Ivermectin use in COVID-19 IDSA Guidelines for Treatment of COVID-19 - Ivermectin Statement on Ivermectin | COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Lopinavir/ritonavir o Use of lopinavir/ritonavir is not recommended because of unfavorable pharmacodynamics and negative clinical trial data. Micronutrients (Vitamin C and Zinc) o Adjunctive use of micronutrients in COVID-19 patients beyond the recommended daily allowances for supplementation is not supported by scientific evidence. o If utilization is necessary for the treatment of nutritional deficiencies, a once daily dosing strategy should be employed. NSAIDs o There is no evidence for or against the management of fever with NSAIDs. Acetaminophen is preferred for management of fever, but each clinical scenario should be carefully evaluated. Nebulized respiratory medications o Nebulized respiratory medications should be avoided in non-intubated patients unless otherwise indicated in patients with bronchospasms to prevent the spread of the COVID-19. For COVID-19 negative non-intubated patients, nebulized respiratory medications are preferred over MDIs. o If indicated, inhalers (MDIs) with spacers are preferred for non-intubated patients. o If indicated, nebulized medications with a closed circuit may be used in intubated patients. Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) o Widespread use of tPA in critically ill COVID-19 patients is not supported by the currently published studies and is not recommended.
