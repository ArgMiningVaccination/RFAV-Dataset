Blood lipids are fat-containing compounds such as cholesterol and triglycerides. A lot of individuals attain healthy levels by consuming a healthy diet and other aspects of their lifestyle. Yet, some need medicines to prevent other medical conditions. A person's blood comprises 3 major types of lipids: - low-density lipoprotein (LDL) - high-density lipoprotein (HDL) - triglycerides If a person experiences dyslipidemia, it generally implies too high levels of LDL or triglycerides. Also, it might indicate too low levels of HDL. LDL cholesterol is the \"bad\" form of cholesterol. This is due to the fact that it might accumulate and produce plaques or clumps in the arterial walls. An excess of plaque in the arteries of a person's heart might result in heart attack. HDL is a good type of cholesterol as it aids in the removal of LDL from the blood. Triglycerides derive from the calories a person consumes, however don't burn instantaneously. The storage of triglycerides occurs in the fat cells. Their release occurs in the form of energy when they require them. If a person consumes more calories than burning rate, person may get an accumulation of triglycerides. High triglycerides and LDL levels puts a person at a high risk of heart attack and stroke. Low HDL levels associate with a greater cardiovascular risk. Read this article to know about the advisable cholesterol levels by age. Summary Dyslipidemia happens when a person has irregular levels of lipids in their blood. Healthy levels of blood lipids naturally differ from individual to individual. Yet, individuals having very low HDL levels or high LDL and triglycerides levels are expected to be at a high risk of atherosclerosis. Types of Dyslipidemia Dyslipidemia can be of two types, primary and secondary dyslipidemia. Primary dyslipidemia is an inherited form, while secondary dyslipidemia is an acquired condition. That implies that it develops from other reasons like [diabetes](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/introduction-to-diabetes/) or obesity. A person might hear the term hyperlipidemia employed correspondently with dyslipidemia. However, this is not completely precise. Hyperlipidemia is a condition in which the levels of LDL or triglycerides become too high. Dyslipidemia refers to higher or lower levels than the normal range of blood fats. Among the particular forms of primary dyslipidemia include: - Familial combined hyperlipidemia. It is a common hereditary reason for both high triglycerides and high LDL cholesterol. If a person has this condition, he or she might develop issues in their teens or 20s. Also, a person develops a high risk of early coronary artery disease, which might give rise to a heart attack. - Familial hyperapobetalipoproteinemia. This health problems occurs when a person has high levels of apolipoprotein B. It is a type of protein considered part of LDL cholesterol. - Familial hypercholesterolemia. It is marked by high total cholesterol. A person may calculate the total cholesterol by adding the levels of LDL and HDL and half of the triglyceride level. A total cholesterol level of below 200 mg per deciliter ( [mg/dL](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/mmol-l-to-mg-dl-blood-sugar-conversion-chart/)) is considered good. Hyperlipoproteinemia is a health problem that might be primary or secondary. If a person experiences this problem, his or her body has trouble in breaking down LDL cholesterol or triglycerides.

Both these medical problems may result in severe health complications such as heart attacks and strokes. Common signs of such conditions can be: - dizziness [leg pain](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/diabetes-leg-pain-cramps-symptoms-treatment-home-remedies-exercise-diet/), particularly while walking or standing - heartburn or indigestion - tightness or pressure in the chest or chest pain - breathing difficulty - pain, tightness, and pressure in the neck, jaw, shoulders, and back - fainting - sleep issues and daytime [fatigue](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/can-high-sugar-make-your-tired-or-fatigue/) - cold sweats - nausea and vomiting - heart palpitations - inflammation in the ankles, legs, feet, stomach, and veins of the neck These signs might deteriorate with stress or physical activity and recuperate when an individual rests.

They can be: - obesity and an inactive lifestyle - cigarette smoking - intake of foods rich in trans-fat and saturated fat Too much intake of alcohol might also add to higher triglyceride levels. A person is at a greater risk of primary dyslipidemia if one or both of parents experienced dyslipidemia. Moreover, advancing age is a risk factor for high levels of cholesterol. Females are expected to have lower levels of LDL as compared to males until menopause. That's when female's levels of LDL begin to rise. Other health problems that may elevate the risk of dyslipidemia can be: - chronic kidney disease - type 2 diabetes - hypothyroidism In addition, a low level of HDL cholesterol relates to a high LDL level, even if the two numbers don't always move in tandem. Dyslipidemia Diagnosis A simple blood test that assesses the levels of LDL, HDL, and triglycerides reveals whether levels are high, low, or in a healthy limit. These numbers might vary from year to year; hence it is better to get an annual blood work done. If a person consumes medicines for dyslipidemia, healthcare provider might wish to do more recurrent blood tests. Treatment of Dyslipidemia The most commonly utilized medicine for treating dyslipidemia is a statin. Statins aids to lower down the levels of LDL levels by hindering with the production of cholesterol in the liver. There are numerous kinds of statins. All of them work in a little different manner, with a few being stronger than others. A physician might also suggest other cholesterol medicines. People might consume them together with a statin or instead of a statin. There a number of pros and cons to consider while selecting cholesterol-controlling medications. Such non-statin medications are: - fibrates such as fenofibrate - ezetimibe - PCSK9 inhibitors Summary A doctor will usually focus on lowering a person's levels of triglycerides and LDL. However, treatment can vary, depending on the underlying cause of dyslipidemia and how severe it is. Doctors may prescribe one or more lipid-modifying medications for people with very high total cholesterol levels of at least 200 milligrams per deciliter of blood. Any Side Effects of Hyperlipidemia Treatment? Any medicine may produce side effects; however, the benefits of statins balance the risks of minor side effects.

A person may also require consuming a prescription medicine as well. The objective is to reduce the damaging cholesterol levels. How to rule out dyslipidemia?
