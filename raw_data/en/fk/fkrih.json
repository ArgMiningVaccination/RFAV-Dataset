The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 6 Alexandra Berneis smiles slightly. She leans back in her chair in her crowded office in the distinctive purple building on a quiet street in downtown Ann Arbor.The executive director of the Ann Arbor Civic Theatre ponders the question at hand: \"The secret to our success? Let me think for a minute.\" She knows there is one \u2014 maybe more than one. After all, the community theater group has celebrated its 90th anniversary and is still going strong, producing mainstage productions, junior theater, workshops, new play readings, and improv every season. \"We're always trying to build up,\" says Berneis. \"We're always trying to incorporate more, offer more opportunities. I love it.\" Keeping community aspect strong The Ann Arbor Civic Theatre is small but mighty. There's a paid staff of two \u2014 Berneis, who goes by \"Alix,\" and her office assistant and volunteer coordinator, Theresa Gratsch. A wardrobe supervisor and scene shop supervisor, in charge of collections, are paid a stipend. Administered through a board of directors, the nonprofit group produces an impressive portfolio of work each year: six mainstage productions, two smaller, \"second stage\" productions, two junior theater shows, two improv showcase weekends, and an assortment of workshops, readings, and educational opportunities for aspiring directors and playwrights. The season's selections are director-driven, Berneis says. Potential directors send in show choices, and a committee hones the options down to those that strike the best balance in terms of content and casting. Plays are usually performed in the Lydia Mendelssohn Theatre or Arthur Miller Theatre, both on the University of Michigan campus. Berneis, a Washtenaw native, has been in her executive position for three years. She has impressive credentials \u2014 a BFA in Theatre Performance from Denison University in Granville, Ohio, and a master's degree in Historic Preservation from Eastern Michigan University \u2014 and an even more remarkable dedication to the theater she heads. \"I developed a love of theater at a young age. My mom has a degree in theater, so my sister and I grew up around it,\" she recalls. \"My mom was doing stuff around here when I was in middle school, so I started tagging along and helping out and then I became even more active.\" Comedy, Drama, M usic and More - Ann Arbor Civic Theatre Shares Secrets of Success By Diane MajeskeThe nonprofit group produces an impressive portfolio of work each year: six mainstage productions, two smaller, \"second stage\" productions, two junior theater shows, two improv showcase weekends, and an assortment of workshops, readings, and educational opportunities for aspiring directors and playwrights. \"Plays are usually performed in the Lydia Mendelssohn Theatre or Arthur Miller Theatre, both on the University of Michigan campus.\" Photo by Lisa GavanThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 7 Explorers Club Continued on page 8The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 8 Photo by Aaron C Wade After college, she returned to Ann Arbor, realizing she didn't want to go into theater professionally, but finding herself drawn to the civic theater she enjoyed so much. Berneis says, \"My mom and I were wardrobe supervisors together... and then this opened up and it seemed like the perfect fit. They joke about being bitten by the theater bug, but it's true. My career path was different, but if you're bitten, you're bitten, and there's no getting away from it.\" Now, with help from Gratsch, a former research scientist who now puts her skills to use matching volunteers to opportunities at the theater, she handles whatever needs to be done to kick-start each season. \"That means basically everything from changing the toilet paper in the bathrooms to getting up on stage and giving a curtain speech... and anything and everything in between. I make sure rights and royalties are available, keep up on office management, and if I need to step in last-minute for an actor, I'll do that, too.\" One of the most important parts of her job, she emphasizes, is keeping the community aspect strong in a theater group that's been active since 1929. \"We have actors who have been with us for years, and we see them returning season after season. But we also get an influx of new people. With Ann Arbor being what it is, a university town, people come and go all the time, so we're seeing new people all the time. And we encourage that. So it's different every show, and that's great.\" A joyful experience Auditioning can be a bit nerve-wracking, particularly if you're from a small town and you don't know what to expect. But Vanessa Banister, who'd recently moved to the area from Marshall, was determined to try out for the lead part in Ann Arbor Civic Theatre's musical Mystery of Edwin Drood in the summer of 2017. Banister had performed before, many times, but she still had butterflies. Ann Arbor Civic Theatre Shares Secrets of Success Ann Arbor Civic Theatre, by the numbers \u2014 In 2017 150+ performed on stage 120+ designers, musicians, technicians and staff brought productions to life50 + attended camps and classes5,000 tickets were sold Also, more than 200 roles were offered to actors in the community:60 + in musicals35 + in plays60 + in junior theater50 + in improv troupes10+ in readings and workshops (Source: Ann Arbor Civic Theatre) She says: \"If you do enough theater and you go enough places, you know that sometimes theaters can have certain preferences, and sometimes there's precasting, and sometimes there's politics in play that you know nothing about. At auditions, Civic made it very clear they don't do any of that. But still, Ann Arbor is a wealth of talent ... you could have knocked me over with a feather when they put the cast list up and I found out I got the part. It was really a dream come true.\"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead Continued from page 7 \"One of the most important parts of her job, [Berneis] emphasizes, is keeping the community aspect strong in a theater group that's been active since 1929.\"So many ways to get involved Berneis has her final answer to my question about the secret to the civic theater's success. \"I think I do,\" she says, hedging her bets. \"We have so many wonderful things, so many wonderful people, so many ways to get involved. But everyone is welcome here. Everyone. Anyone can audition for any role. You don't need experience.\" She continues: \"We take people with all levels of experience. If this is your first show and you want to audition for the lead, then go for it. Each director is looking for the best fit, the best audition. It's an open policy. And I love that.... I love talking to people who've had a good experience and knowing we made a difference to them. I love hearing that we were welcoming. I love hearing that we're a creative outlet. It makes us successful, I think. But it also makes me really happy.\" The Ann Arbor Civic Theatre has learning opportunities for aspiring performers of all age levels, including classes, workshops, and camps. It's a creative outlet for volunteers, as well. For more information on getting involved, visit a2ct.orgBanister rates her experience with the theater as amazing: \"I had never done anything with them before, and they were willing to look at a brand-new person and give them a shot, and I am so grateful for that. Everyone was so supportive, and so kind. The whole feeling behind Ann Arbor Civic Theatre is that being able to do shows is a gift, and it should be a joyful experience.\" She returned, in the cast of Heathers, the Musical , in the summer of 2018. Even with school and a job, Banister says it's worth it. \"Theater is transforming. You keep coming back. There's real magic in creating a world and reality that you can live in for awhile and be someone other than yourself.\" That magic, she says, isn't just for the performers: \"If you're doing your job right on stage, if you're truly present and connecting with another person, you can open up people in the audience \u2014 open them up to emotions they maybe aren't comfortable with in everyday life. But maybe in a darkened theater, they can have those moments where their heart is opened and it's safe to be who they are.\" Live theater is powerful, she says, even in a world ruled by technology. \"There's something about having a group of human beings in the same space, at the same time, feeling the same thing at the same moment, that's priceless,\" she says. \"It's like everyone's heartbeat is synchronized, and it does wonderful things to connect us.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 9 ~ 16 -17 Tickets: 734.971.2228 WWW.A2CT.ORGBreaking the Rules your theatre. your town.

Inspired and moved by the hashtag, a team of southeast Michigan-based activists, educators, parents, survivors, and community members came together to host a community-based healing initiative called the # MeToo Storytelling Salon. The first #MeToo Storytelling Salon took place in late 2017 in Ann Arbor, and over 60 people attended from all over the region. The organizers of the salon utilized their skills and experience to create a safe, holistic, and strong-walled container to support survivors of sexual abuse in order for them to share their stories at the microphone. The salon was also a fundraiser for Washtenaw County Safe House Center, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to provide safety, support, advocacy, and resources for survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence and their children, \"and to work relentlessly to change the systems and attitudes that allow this abuse to continue.\" Activists from around the country reached out to salon organizers to ask how to run their own #MeToo Storytelling Salons, and the organizers have created a free PDF download (link at the end of this article) to share with anyone who is interested in running salons in this format. In the shadow of the Kavanaugh hearings, I talked with two of the organizers, Jean Henry and Carisa Wilder, about what inspired them to create the event and how they hope to see the movement evolve. Sara Vos: Jean, it's been 15 months since #MeToo. How did it change your life? What thoughts are moving through you as you reflect on what is different now compared to this point in time, say, 18 months ago? Jean Henry: For decades, I had been talking openly about rape culture, violence against women, and sexual violence of all kinds. When I spoke of the pervasiveness of sexual violence, I was often met with incredulity. But more often the response was a kind of virtual shrug.Sexual assault was both normalized and denied. I guess normalization is really its own kind of denial. We tell ourselves we are powerless to stop it, and so we must be strong enough to survive it. That's the story we told ourselves of necessity in the wake of abuse. That's also the story we told ourselves about rape culture. Like every coping mechanism, it's useful but not the way out. We had to change the cultural narrative. And it wasn't one powerful voice that moved us forward but the collective force of many voices, all strong but with as much variation as there are humans\u2014quavering, tentative, angry, sad, matter of fact, resigned, soulful, contemplative, analytic, and even vengeful. In retrospect, it seems obvious that this movement was the only way. I just never really imagined it happening with such incredible force. Finally, the message was heard. One could feel the curtain being pulled back on sexual violence. And the conversation became as dimensional as the voices in it, by which I mean as dimensional as the humans speaking their truths. I say \"humans\" rather than confining this movement to a gendered experience. Make no mistake\u2014#MeToo is a feminist movement. And women comprise the vast majority of survivors of sexual violence. But not all. If you think about it, everyone is negatively affected by sexual violence. It erodes our humanity. Feminism is a humanitarian appeal made through the lens of the female experience. Sara Vos: Where do you think the movement is headed? What is at the heart of it? Jean Henry: #MeToo is asking for sexual violence in all its forms\u2014in all its stories\u2014 to be addressed culturally. So, how now to take this new awareness and codify the shift into our individual actions and our society as a whole? This is my focus going forward. How can we engage men in the process without eroding the solidarity we have built? We can't have safety without engaging men. We need men to become whole, as well. This is my perspective. I know not everyone sees things the same way and I totally understand. This is just where I am now. It's the work I see. And I honor the work that others see and take on. Sara Vos: Right before we hit the one year anniversary, the Kavanaugh nomination happened. Can you speak about that? Jean Henry: The Kavanaugh nomination, hearing, and confirmation was mentally and emotionally exhausting for many of us. The end result shows how long and deep this work still needs to go. We persist. There's so much to do. If we all take our piece and work where we can most effectively, then #MeToo will be a cultural movement with lasting impact, not j ust a cultural moment. We will do this to honor the courage and experiences of Christine Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez, #MeTooAnn Arbor's Storytelling Salon, One Year Later Conversations with Carisa Wilder & Jean Henry # The next #MeToo Storytelling Salon will take place on March 16th from 7 PM to 9 PM, at Sun Shen, 2466 East Stadium Blvd. For more info visit their Facebook page www.facebook.com/MeToo- Storytelling-Salon-Ann- Arbor-1437627819706565/ \"Sexual assault was both normalized and denied.

Continued on Page 12The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 12 and the other survivors and allies who came forward asking to be heard and seen. And that collective agency will render Kavanaugh and men like him just a small part of our larger story. We can deconstruct rape culture piece by piece. We still have the opportunity to give Blasey Ford the last word. The pendulum of social progress always swings back before redirecting and pushing ahead again with even more force. \"The arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice.\" (Martin Luther King, Jr. quoting Theodore Parker ) Our time has just begun. I believe we have started something unstoppable. I am having really amazing new kinds of conversations with men about sexual violence. I am talking to business owners and workers about how to address gender bias of all kinds. I am still listening to the stories of survivors. Over the past couple of months, in the wake of the Kavanaugh hearing, three old friends told their stories publicly for the first time. I am present\u2014listening, engaging, and working. I can't say exactly how it will go any more than I can predict the weather after this week, but I believe I can tell which way the wind is blowing. I just know I can't go back, only forward, and I know I'm safe, because I know I'm not alone. Onward! SV: I am feeling so inspired by your perspective and what you have shared here. I'm on board, but what about the nay-sayers? We live in a time of 90-second news cycles, and some nay-sayers have said that #MeToo is no longer relevant. How can we help folks see that this work is still absolutely imperative? Jean Henry: The #MeToo movement will remain relevant so long as there are stories of sexual abuse to be told, so long as sexual violence is pervasive in our culture. I look forward to the time when that is no longer the case. The best way to maintain awareness and momentum is to keep telling our stories and making spaces to do so. SV: I know you as someone who is very politically active on many progressive fronts. Do you have any thoughts as to ways community organizers and other activists can take up the #MeToo Storytelling Salon format in their own communities? Jean Henry: I would invite everyone to make their own model as suits their community. I would also challenge them to define community broadly, to consider who they exclude by intention or neglect, and why. What we did was both intuitive and intentional and also utilized the community resources we had at hand. Most communities have the capacity to host their own event. SV: If someone in another area wanted to run a salon for their community, what advice might you give them? What wisdom was gained from the one you ran in December 2017? Jean Henry: There are a few things we did to create a space conducive to very personal and vulnerable sharing of which I am quite proud. We made sure to have people on hand (and well identified) with experience in treating trauma to be available to the brave women who told their stories as well as listeners. While volunteer professionals are ideal, I think peers could provide this support with some instruction on keeping the focus on the other person's experience and being affirmative and attentive in response. It was well facilitated, with enough structure and flexibility to put people at ease and encourage them to speak. We did not limit who could attend, but we set affirmative standards for audience engagement. We also allowed anyone in the room to let us know if someone was present with whom they had personal experience, who made them feel ill at ease. And we politely asked those people to leave. And the two people so identified did so, willingly, and without complaint. I think that's a credit to the atmosphere our collective presence made in that room. No one wanted to be disruptive of the healing that was being offered there. There was very little ego present. Those were our standards and practices. Each community will have its own. If anyone is interested in adopting our format, we would be happy to share with them in greater detail [link below]. But storytelling is as old as humanity. We know how to do this. That doesn't mean it's easy. Creating a supportive environment is essential. Jean Henry describes herself as a local business person, mother, survivor, and \"trouble maker.\" She can be contacted at jeanhenrya2@gmail.com. Sara Vos: Carisa, you're a holistic psychotherapist in private practice in Ann Arbor,and one of the reasons the #MeToo Storytelling Salon came into being. Why were you inspired to mobilize the community around an event or gathering, post #MeToo? Carisa Wilder: As a therapist, I had several clients who had experienced significant sexual trauma and were activated by what was going on in the news at the time. One person even went to the emergency room due to a panic attack while watching and listening to the news. She was told that nothing was really physically wrong with her\u2014that she \"really should take better care\" of herself. No one ever asked her about past or current trauma. The medical system is but one of the systems that has not yet caught up to the reality of sexual trauma in women's lives, or how that trauma impacts us over the course of our lives. Of course, when #MeToo erupted, I saw and read many FB posts\u2014 family, friends, young, old... the vast majority of female-identified people have experienced some level of gender-based trauma. At the time, I was re-reading Bessel Van der Kolk's The Body Keeps the Score [which has large sections on group therapy and various healing settings for trauma integration] and had also been thinking about how powerfully healing it can be to share our stories in safe spaces. I can feel that powerful healing with my clients in our sessions. However, I became aware of a need to gather in the physical presence of a group. To witness and be witnessed with care and consideration without attachment to a particular outcome. I believe we accomplished that [with the #MeToo Storytelling Salon] in a way that worked. SV: I am a huge fan of Bessel Van der Kolk's work. When The Body Keeps the Score came out in 2015, I read it cover to cover and lent it to friends. I was surprised to read so many examples in the book about the ways that the medical system, generally speaking, does not yet understand or know how to recognize, treat, or \"#MeToo is asking for sexual violence in all its forms\u2014 in all its stories\u2014to be addressed culturally.\" \u2014 Jean Henry \"...I became aware of a need to gather in the physical presence of a group.

For example, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders still does not recognize complex-PTSD although many trauma experts have named it and researched it for years. To know the truth of what is going on in peoples' lives and experiences, and have that juxtaposed against what the dominant culture says is true or allows space to talk about in our public spheres, can make you a bit crazy. To that end, it feels like #MeToo is this huge, sweeping cultural educational moment AND movement, in which the stories that women and survivors have been telling for years are finally being able to be heard, and thankfully, often believed, in a wider way. And yet, there is still so much educational work to do. SV: How are you seeing the effects of this cultural change in your own life and in the general post #MeToo landscape? Have you noticed any changes? Carisa Wilder: In my daily life, I notice a shift in my own level of empowerment around choosing what feels safe and how I feel safe, as opposed to being at the mercy of decades of programming around how I'm supposed to feel and respond to the violence I experience and witness. I notice this with others, too. There's more permission to speak up. I believe the #MeToo experience culturally pushed us along a path of greater public awareness of the prevalence of sexual violence and how profoundly those experiences affect our lives and our communities. I hope the movement continues to encourage individuals and communities around the world to dialogue and take action to heal both perpetrators and survivors. I hope the movement continues to address the factors that have created systemic sexual violence. I hope that we continue to see more folks take leadership roles in their communities to listen to, support healing, and provide safety for all survivors. I hope communities everywhere continue to organize #MeToo events. SV: Do you have any ideas about what could make this successful? Perhaps as a similar model to free support groups modeled in the recovery community, such as 12-step or Celebrate Recovery? Carisa Wilder: I imagine communities developing approaches that are relevant to them\u2014likely through organizational support from groups that have been working for many years to address violence and sexual violence. When we hear each other's stories publicly shared on a national level \u2014 like Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, many are activated from that sharing and while that can be very triggering and uncomfortable, that's also a cue that something needs to move, to shift. Some won't be ready yet, some may engage in a level of external support, and some will be inspired and moved to create space for public sharing on local/regional levels. I could see a general model eventually being developed, and that could be - especially when communities make it their own. When we planned the Ann Arbor #MeToo Salon, we reached out to several communities to incorporate the knowledge gained from their experiences. SV: Do you see any barriers to accessing the Storytelling Salons? Is there anything you would do differently the next time around? Carisa Wilder: Yes. I would like to see resources of time, money, and logistical support gifted to organizers and leaders in historically marginalized communities to run salons. The networks of the organizers and speakers, along with the venue selected, the time of the event, how the event is advertised, are all factors in attendance, participation, and inclusivity, so I think it's very important that all of those factors shift and are flexible so that the audience/participants shift, too! What I mean by that is these salons offer the potential to disrupt sexual violence at the community level, and it's imperative that they are as accessible to as many different kinds of communities and groups as possible. SV: What do you think may inspire or motivate other therapists and community organizers to run more #MeToo Storytelling Salons? Carisa Wilder: I feel that inspiration sometimes comes from the most unexpected places so that's difficult to say! Many of the therapists and community organizers I know are already doing deep healing work in their practices. In this case, I was driven to take on the extra tasks of organizing a salon because I felt that it would benefit individuals and our community. I reached out to friends because I knew I couldn't, and didn't want to, do it alone. \"To know the truth of what is going on in peoples' lives and experiences, and have that juxtaposed against what the dominant culture says is true or allows space to talk about in our public spheres, can make you a bit crazy.\" \u2014 C arisa Wilder Soaking in warm water is one of the oldest forms of therapy, dating back to the Romans. Even then, people knew that soaking in a hot bath could effectively treat pain and other ailments. Modern hot tubs have taken this ancient principle and perfected it, adding therapeutic massage jets to increase the healing effects of soaking in hot water. While hot tubs are great simply for relaxing or unwinding after a long day, they can also provide relief from many common ailments like headaches, back pain, fibromyalgia and even type 2 diabetes. They do this with a combination of heat, buoyancy and massage therapy.

One of the extremely talented local wordsmiths that I am delighted to have in my writing community is Emmy Jackson, author of the female-driven urban fantasy series Empty Cradle, which takes place in a post-apocalyptic America touched by the eponymous epidemic called Empty Cradle, rendering 85% of North America's women infertile. The first novel also begins along what is now I-75, six hours south of the \"walled city\" of Detroit, the destination of one of the main characters. Beyond solid writing technique and easy storytelling, I am always impressed when a male author writes women so well, and I wanted to get to know Jackson better and ask him about his writing. Like many of us, Jackson got his start writing fiction in high school, of which he says, \"It was terrible. Absolutely terrible. I cringe to think about it now.\" He also wrote for the high school newspaper and literary magazine. He then went on to minor in creative writing at the University of Michigan. \"I wrote as a hobby, then eventually tumbled into freelance journalism, which would be my first job as a paid writer.\" His first post-high school publication was \"a review of the 1999 Ford Explorer.\" Jackson was born in Detroit, so it is rather fitting that his favorite topic to write about is, \"Cars! I am a car person since childhood, and when appropriate, you'll see wheeled vehicles in my stories. In the same vein, I like writing stories that take place on roads or during travel.\" This knowledge is put on full The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 14 Crysta Goes Visiting In this column, Crysta Coburn writes about crazywisom-esque people and happenings around Ann Arbor. Sloe Gin Fizz: the Whimsical Art of Nicole Ray As a freelance writer, I spend a lot of time in coffee shops, and as I sipped my way through Ypsilanti's various offerings, I noticed something similar about the art on their walls. There were colorful prints of cute, whimsical animals, household appliances, book nooks, and other cozy scenes. The artist behind these endearing works is Nicole Ray, also known as Sloe Gin Fizz. Some of my favorite prints are an otter relaxing in a teacup, a giraffe wearing five scarves, a robot riding a fiery unicorn and holding a banner that reads \"Let's Ride!\" Actually, it's really hard to choose favorites in the playful world that Ray has created in her art. I wanted to know the story behind these mischievous creations, so I contacted Ray, who was kind enough to answer my inquiries. Ray was not born in the Ann Arbor area, so I wondered what brought her here. \"I grew up on Long Island in New York and in Northern Virginia for my high school years,\" she said. \"My husband is from Chelsea, which is what brought me here.\" As for becoming an artist, she said, \"I've always drawn, though resisted it as a profession for a very long time. I went back to school for a degree in illustration in my early 30s, but still didn't truly pursue it until I moved to Michigan in 2008. I was coming out of design work in the newspaper world, so knew that was not a way forward. I opened up an Etsy shop while searching for jobs, got invited to participate in my first craft show and dove head first into that world which opened so many doors.\" Animals are featured often in her art (\"I love to draw all kinds of animals\"), but so are \"calm interior scenes.\" She explained, \"I love to read and books are a great influence on my work, both in terms of content and the idea of making a time and a space for reading. Much of my domestic imagery revolves around calm spaces that are conducive to reflection and time to oneself. This might explain why my animal themes are more kooky and out there in the world.\" 'I love to read and books are a great influence on my work, both in terms of content and the idea of making a time and a space for reading.' ~Nicole RayNR EJ 'I am a car person since childhood, and when appropriate, you'll see wheeled vehicles in my stories.

As for other influences, Jackson said that the \"most noticeable\" is his daily life is, \"A carryover from childhood play; at any given time there are three to four worlds rolling along in my head, in real time, and I tend to find ways to translate whatever's going on in my life into one of those,\" he said. \"As a result, happenings in day-to-day life, both significant and insignificant, have a way of creating plot points and driving stories.\" Emmy Jackson can be contacted through his website www.emmyjackson.com. His books are available online and for purchase at the Crazy Wisdom Bookstore & Tea Room in Ann Arbor and Grey Wolfe Scriptorium in Clawson. Molly Jones and Free Jazz For someone as talented as local musician Molly Jones, it is surprising that she did not decide to seriously pursue music until college. \"Since then,\" she said, \"it's been a journey of meeting a lot of people who have encouraged me and led me to opportunities.\" While still very young, Jones started piano lessons. Now, though, \"I play saxophones (all of them), flutes (all of them), and electronics (laptop and samples), and I also can but rarely do play piano and electric bass. I'd say I like the saxophone because of its ability to be expressive, but I like the flute because it can fit into any style of music.\" Jones now holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Jazz and Contemplative Studies with Highest Honors from the University of Michigan and Master of Fine Arts in Integrated Composition, Improvisation, and Technology from University of California, Irvine. Her debut album Microliths, a jazz septet, was nominated for Debut Album 2017 in NPR Jazz Critics' Poll. Last January, Jones was named one of 12 musicians to watch by the Detroit Metro Times, calling her \"without a doubt, the real deal\" and praising her compositions. Listening to Microliths, I found the tracks innovative and interesting, each one unique and distinctive. It's not the jazz I once listened to with my grandfather, but I think Grandpa also would have found the free sounds and creative flow compelling. My favorite is \"Olbers' Black Sky Paradox,\" which has a swinging start! I wondered what inspired Jones and influenced her music. \"I'm influenced by experimental artists including the AACM, Alice Coltrane, Meredith Monk, Pamela Z, and other multidisciplinary artists,\" answered Jones. \"I'm inspired by artists who create performance work that goes beyond the traditional boundaries of concert performance.\" Current projects include, \"writing an opera-ballet which will premiere in March with some awesome collaborators, and I'm planning to start working on my second album soon.\" Jones also added, \"I always have pieces of music and video art that I'm making, so I'll fill in my time with that between larger projects.\" Molly Jones can be contacted online through her website www.mollyjonesmusic.com, where you can also find clips of her music and poetry.

I never gave the making of coffee much thought except for finding a roast I like and a brewing method that worked for my taste and lifestyle. These two things have changed over the years\u2014the only consistent being that I like it simple and on the stout side. I recently became more curious about specialty coffee, especially our local artisan scene. There seem to be coffee shops and cafes on every corner, but only a few serving local or artisan roasted, sustainably grown, ethical beans and brews. Those in the know call this \"specialty coffee.\" The question that kept popping into my head was, \"What makes specialty coffee so special?\" I wondered if there was an art and or science to making an exceptional cup of coffee warranting upward of four dollars a cup. I was also curious if our area cultivates a vibrant coffee scene and community. All of this curiosity was \"buzzfueled\" by my own creations brewed in the dim moments before sunrise. I started buying various local beans while experimenting with each cup. Every morning I meditated to ascertain whether I even had the palette for creating an exceptional cup of java. I started adding flavors like cardamom, nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla. I used various milks and creams too. In the end I still prefer a dark, rich, nutty roast with robust flavor, and a subtle chocolate undertone, without anything added to hinder the organic qualities craftily roasted into ethically grown beans. These beans provide a good life for farmers, their communities, roasters, and baristas. I found myself immersed in the activity of understanding more about coffee culture and the chain of human hands involved in creating an artistic delicious beverage we consumers seem to take for granted.A Round-Table Discussion with Local ExpertsCoffee Buzz \u2014 The Art, Science, and Community of Coffee With these curiosities I set out on a mission to find local experts in the areas of roasting and brewing. There were too many to include, but I believe I gathered a well-rounded tribe from which to explain the somewhat hidden art and science of brewing coffee. First, I attended a class on various brewing methods led by David Myers, owner of Mighty Good Coffee, and expert Barista, Jen\u00e9e Schneider. The class was extremely fun and inspiring. Seven of us enthusiastic classmates gathered one Saturday morning in July to learn how to make five different cups of coffee from five different coffee brewing apparatus (makers-methods): Chemex, Hario V60 Pour Over, Classic French Press, Iced Hario V60 and an extremely cool looking Vacuum Pot, which was more like performing a lab experiment than brewing coffee. We were given a detailed brew guide for each method we tried while learning all the subtleties of each pour, and participated in what they called cupping (a tasting). During the cupping, we were able to decipher what we prefer in our cup of Joe and why. We also learned a little of the vernacular one might never hear outside of this caffeine-fueled environment. Jen\u00e9e commented that teaching customers coffee terminology helps her manifest more precisely what the customer wants and creates a communication between barista and consumer. It also helps the customer better understand the science behind brewing. There was an emphasis placed on the science of making a great cup of coffee: the best water to use (filtered and/or spring), water temperature for brewing (212 F-Boiling Point), the need to dampen the paper filter before adding grounds, how to best weigh (not measure) coffee grounds, the best grind for each gadget, the ratio of grounds vs. water, and how long to allow the grounds to sit in the water before pouring and drinking (it is different for each brewing device and method). David feels it is best to have the coffee beans ground where purchased or from the roaster, based on the type of brewing method, and to store ground coffee in an air tight container (for up to ten days in a dark cupboard). Storing in the freezer is debatable depending on who you ask. When I broached the subject of keeping coffee fresh, from roasting to brewing with Jim Saborio, owner of Comet Coffee in Ann Arbor, he explained: \"Over the last several years, consumers have really been trained to focus on roast dates as a determinant of freshness. There is some general confusion that freshness is a determinant of quality. Quality is the result of processes running from the I wondered if there was an art and or science to making an exceptional cup of coffee warranting upward of four dollars a cup. Every morning I meditated to ascertain whether I even had the palette for creating an exceptional cup of java.GabcdefghijklmnrstuvwxyzABCDEFG G G Jim Saborio The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 19 growing conditions of where the coffee is produced to how it was packaged and stored after roasting. Coffee often needs to \"rest\" two to four days after roasting to develop flavor and sweetness. To properly rest, coffee needs to be sealed in an oxygen-free environment. These days, most specialty coffee is packaged in bags with a one-way valve that allows the coffee to release CO2 but keeps oxygen from entering the bag. Valve bags keep the coffee pretty fresh for about two weeks, especially if they've been flushed with an inert gas like nitrogen. Once opened and exposed to oxygen, I've noticed a considerable deterioration of flavor and complexity in as little as 12 hours. Oxidation is an unavoidable enemy of coffee. Roast dates are a nice point of reference, but oxidation always wins. I avoid buying coffee packaged in non-valve bags and keep away from coffee being sold in open-air bulk bins. Learn to cherish the first few cups of a freshly opened bag and humor the cups that follow.\" From the class at Mighty Good Coffee I manifested a round-table discussion and cupping with three local roasters: David Meyers and Barista Jen\u00e9e Schneider from Mighty Good Coffee, Tom Isaia owner of Coffee Express, and RoosRoast's Kath Weider-Roos. We tasted various roasts and techniques while engaging in enlightening conversation at the Jefferson Market. It was interesting to witness these roasters supporting one another. They all have the common goals of educating the public and delivering quality coffee to their customers in ethical and artisanal ways. This is community. And the community goes even deeper between the shop owners, roasters, baristas, and in some cases farmers. Many roasters travel to coffee growing countries to buy their beans directly from \"fair trade\" farmers. Some will offer this information on the bag of coffee you purchase. According to David Meyers, \"The best researchers and thinkers in coffee are paying attention and looking for solutions in social responsibility, equity, climate issues, and ways to support farmers. As far as we have come, in terms of buying and selling coffee, the first wave [of the coffee revolution] established how coffee is traded and that hasn't changed in ways that protect the majority of coffee grown around the world.\" We are an evolving world with people who are doing their best in their own fields of interest to make more responsible and thoughtful, if not meaningful, choices -- from how to run their business to what coffee beans to purchase. Coffee growers, roasters, and shop owners have a responsibility in creating this next coffee wave for the betterment of our local and global community and for the planet. Our issues and priorities have changed over the past 50 years as has the coffee industry. Whatever a coffee shop owner's passion for creating is (creative space for free speech, a room where office-less worker bees can do their work, a safe place for students to socialize and study, or to provide a better living for farmers in the poorest of countries as well as their baristas and support staff), those who work in this realm have a certain heavy load to carry if they want their art and passion to be a vehicle for change. In other words, social responsibility can begin with the cup of coffee one purchases.G \"There is some general confusion that freshness is a determinant of quality. Quality is the result of processes running from the growing conditions of where the coffee is produced to how it was packaged and stored after roasting.\" \u2014 Jim Saborio Owner Comet Coffee Continued on page 20The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 20 \"Roasting is so fun and when I started doing it, I felt like I finally found what I want to do. The way I want to engage with people and my own creativity and theirs, is through coffee.\" \u2014 Kath Weider-Roos of Roos Roast John Roos from RoosRoast adopted a tag line that is printed on each bag claiming, Free Speech Coffee . When I asked Kath Weider-Roos, John's wife and business partner, about this she explained it this way: \"John adopted the phrase early on to reference the way coffee opens people up to start talking. Also, as artists we believe in the power of expression and the ideals of free speech.\" John Roos of RoosRoast Sam Schaefer of Stovetop RoastersThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 21 Coffee can be a metaphor for a new generation of impassioned community builders, artists, scientists, and entrepreneurs who have an ethical standard they are willing to stand by. In other words, social responsibility can begin with the cup of coffee one purchases. And some bags offer creative and one-of-a-kind artwork, too. RoosRoast and Stovetop Roasters are known for their unique coffee names and in-house designed artwork. I asked all the interviewees if they considered their work an art form or science. Each one said both art and science except for one of Stovetop's owners, Steven Holm, who said, \"I see roasting as a science. There are a lot of complex chemical reactions taking place while roasting coffee and our job is to use the roaster as a tool to manipulate those reactions to achieve a particular taste. I don't believe that there is any wrong or right way to roast, it just depends on one's preferences and what they are looking to provide to their customers.\" On the other hand Sam Schaefer of Stovetop felt this way: \"I believe everything can be viewed as art. Coffee is living organic matter, and it has some rules and boundaries for how it must be handled to ensure excellent flavor, but inside these boundaries we have the incredible opportunity to explore and make decisions that allow our coffee to taste any way we want it to. I think that pursuit of discovering what a coffee can offer us, and finding ways to highlight its exquisite beauty , is everything.\" On this same subject Kath Weider-Roos explained her take on coffee as an expression of art: \"Roasting is so fun and when I started doing it, I felt like I finally found what I want to do. The way I want to engage with people and my own creativity and theirs, is through coffee.\" Tom Isaia of Coffee Express, one of the first (if not the first) local roasters who began the journey of roasting in 1980, after owning an espresso machine business for ten years, responded to this query, too. He said, \"Roasting coffee can be quite technical, and quite a few rely on computers to analyze and make adjustments. I don't want to get into a debate on whether a human can outperform a microprocessor, but roastmasters with a lot of years under their belt are comforting. So, my take is that it is both science and art.\" I found Tom to be the most experienced roaster I spoke with. Tom has been in the business the longest and observed all three waves of the coffee industry locally, as well as mentored several younger area roasters.\u2014 Coffee Buzz \u2014 visit the webstore ANN ARBOR'S BEST BREAKFAST SECRETWord on the street i s... we have the WORLDS BEST AVOCADO TOAST. *This is a completely unscientific metric. roosroast.comKITCHEN OPEN DAILY Until 3pmDOWNTOWN CAFE 117 E.

We as an industry of growing, processing, preparing, and serving coffee are still striving to celebrate and elevate the coffee and the hard work that goes into it.\" \u2014 Steven Holm The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 22 I listened to a podcast referring to the three waves of coffee, in which we are at the tail end of the third. I asked the group about this. David Meyers from Mighty Good had his own take on the three waves: \"First wave, coffee as a commodity product, not so different than sugar, wheat, corn, orange juice, et cetera. Second wave was the introduction of coffee through specialty outlets. Peet's, Coffee Connection, and eventually Starbucks, were all part of the second wave from the 1960's into the 1990's when coffee moved from the diner setting for endless cups of free and unlimited refills of cheap Joe, to more expensive cups of coffee from smaller roasters, with no free refills. The third wave was what happened as a result of coffee becoming popular and the birth of the internet. Information and interest in coffee grew and people wanted, and could find, a more unique experience. The whole coffee chain adapted, and in some ways exploited, these opportunities.\" Sam from Stovetop had this to say: \"The mission is still the same; coffee is an incredibly beautiful and fascinating fruit. We as an industry of growing, processing, preparing, and serving coffee are still striving to celebrate and elevate the coffee and the hard work that goes into it. If anything, the future (fourth wave) of coffee is actually about unification and removing the barrier between what is specialty coffee, and what isn't. It is about elevating that bottom line, in people and coffee, and empowering those who have previously been overlooked!\" We talked about the fact that customers use caf\u00e9s as their office or study room while at times only buying one cup of coffee. This makes it a challenge for caf\u00e9 owners and baristas to make a living. I asked Onni Stone, a photographer friend who was part of the roundtable discussion, her perspective as she is a struggling student utilizing the free space of a coffee house for studying and also to be in community with others: \"I wish we could find a common ground where coffee house owners set limits they need to not be frustrated by people like me who do not have a lot of money and like to have a social place to work from without feeling unwelcome.\" Some shops turn off Wi-Fi at certain times of the day or require people to spend a minimum amount when using Wi-Fi. There are some shops around the world that provide \"Suspended Coffee\" similar to paying it forward. Customers can buy two cups of coffee, one for themselves and one for a person who cannot afford a cup. Maybe consider buying a struggling student or one down on luck a cup of Joe. In this way you help the customer, shop owner, and barista. I personally love the idea of suspended coffee, because it brings the human and social element into the conversation. Coffee shops provide people not only with a social space from which to work and study, but also to engage with one another in conversations, political dialog, and space to discuss ideas, \"in a sober and non violent way,\" says Kath. (See: conversational-leadership.net/coffee-houses/). John Roos from RoosRoast adopted a tag line that is printed on each bag claiming, Free Speech Coffee . When I asked Kath Weider-Roos, John's wife and business partner, about this she explained it this way: \"John adopted the phrase early on to reference the way coffee opens people up to start talking. Also, as artists we believe in the power of expression and the ideals of free speech.\" This is reflected through the artwork and stories John creates for each of their signature roasts like \"Lobster Butter Love.\" When the participants were asked if their coffee careers brought them joy the overwhelming answer was YES! Consider this when you pick the businesses you want to support. Thank them for their service to our community, culture, and that wonderful BUZZ that gets you through a tough day. One Barista told me she acquired joy knowing she was contributing to making someone's day a little brighter. Which reminds me... Please tip your baristas well. They pour their talents, craft, and spirit into each cup and deserve to know they are appreciated. Onni's take-away was eloquently stated: \"I loved hearing the perspectives of people knowledgeable and passionate about their field. The history of local coffee roasters has enriched my daily coffee experiences. It made me more mindful and appreciative of coffee and the people who are involved in making it.\" Ther e are many websites where you can learn the technical aspects of growing, roasting, and brewing beans. The National Coffee Association is a good place to begin www.ncausa.org. Jessica Meyer, past Lead Barista at Crazy Wisdom Tea Room also recommended two books on the subject: God in a Cup by Michaele Weissman, and The World and Atlas of Coffee by James Hoffman. Both are available at Crazy Wisdom Bookstore. Sam Schae fer of Stovetop Roasters competes in barista competitions. Top level baristas from all over the nation and/or world compete to find the best in their field. This information is at www.sca.coffee . There are classes, cuppings, and events at almost every coffee shop and roaster lab mentioned in this article.

Ann Arbor musician, music teacher, and massage therapist, Rob Meyer-Kukan, became certified in Vibrational Sound Therapy (VST) in July of 2018. He now offers individual and group VST sessions as well as incorporating it into some of his massage offerings. The six-day intensive training in Chicago prepared him to use Himalayan singing bowls to induce deep relaxation and stress release. The bowls are gently struck with a felt mallet on or near the body and vibrate with a peaceful sound. This modality can stand alone or can be combined with massage, reiki and/or aromatherapy to create a session catered to the receiver. See page 29. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 29 Continued on page 30 New Offerings by Established Businesses and Practitioners Ann Arbor musician, music teacher, and massage therapist, Rob Meyer-Kukan, became certified in Vibrational Sound Therapy (VST) in July of 2018. He now offers individual and group VST sessions as well as incorporating it into some of his massage offerings. The six-day intensive training in Chicago prepared him to use Himalayan singing bowls to induce deep relaxation and stress release. The bowls are gently struck with a felt mallet on or near the body and vibrate with a peaceful sound. This modality can stand alone or can be combined with massage, reiki and/or aromatherapy to create a session catered to the receiver. Meyer-Kukan said he has been interested in the singing bowls for a few years and uses them in his own daily mediation practice. He described an experience on the first day of his training. It was a stressful and sad time for him as his mother had recently passed away. He was given a VST session and recalls lying face down on a massage table while the practitioner struck a bowl at his feet. He said he \"felt the warmth of the vibrations up through [his] body,\" and was able to let go, relax, sleep, and rest, as he hadn't done for weeks. He said he came out of the session with a \"deep understanding of his own grief.\" On the second day, in another session, he said he felt he saw his mother again, whole and well, and he felt transformed. He felt he had to share this healing modality with as many people as possible. Meyer-Kukan offers VST sessions at his in-home studio on the southeast side of Ann Arbor near Packard and Platt. He also offers Singing Bowl Meditations or \"sound baths\" for groups at Joy: Freedom in Motion on Main Street in downtown Ann Arbor. Studio owner Heather Glidden is, among other skills, a guided meditation coach and provides some verbal guided meditation while Meyer-Kukan plays the sound bowls in the center of the room. Participants sit or lie on yoga mats or blankets in a comfortable position while they listen and meditate. Meyer-Kukan said he has been able to help clients with PTSD or emotional stress relax and sleep well again using this modality. He said it has a cumulative effect, with faster and deeper relaxation each session as the brain and body become accustomed to it. In addition to relaxation and stress relief, he said it is useful for anyone \"looking for a way to heighten their journey of inward understanding of themselves.\" Rob Meyer-Kukan can be reached at 248.962.5475. His website is www. robmeyerkukan.com and his email address is rob@robmeyerkukan.com. Sound bath group events at Joy are listed at their website: www.joyannarbor.com. Ann Arbor's Bio Energy Medical Center has moved, and after 30 years in business, it has purchased its own building. They are now in a fully renovated space in Ann Arbor Commerce Park, 3.5 miles from their previous office. The new office has polished concrete and bamboo flooring, and non-toxic zero VOC paint on all the walls. Bio Energy has long been one of Ann Arbor's leading integrative medical practices. It was founded by, and is led by, Dr. James Neuenschwander, who has been featured in The Crazy Wisdom Journal a number of times over the years. (An in-depth interview with \"Dr. Neu\" was in Issue #48, May thru August 2011, available on our online archive at www.crazywisdomjournal.com.) The Center is now offering four new IV Therapy treatments in addition to their original IV services. Their traditional offerings are Vitamin C, which is said to \"help support the immune system, fight infection, reduce inflammation, and improve fatigue\"; Meyer IV, designed by Dr. John Meyers in the 70s to \"improve fatigue and overall function\"; Chelation IV, to mitigate heavy metals toxicity; and Glutathione Push, a major antioxidant boost which is said to help a variety of conditions. The new offerings are exclusive to the center. \"Stress Resistance\" is a cocktail of antioxidants and nutrients designed to help \"protect the immune system and promote mood balancing,\" and may help with anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. \"Regenerate and Replenish\" targets the hair, skin, and nails for an anti-aging treatment. \"Fatigue Fighter\" is designed \"reduce brain fog.\" \"The Ultimate\" is a combination of all vitamins and minerals found in other IV treatments at BEMC, for those looking to achieve optimum health. The benefit of IV therapy, according to the center, is that it bypasses the digestive system and thus any stomach upset, loss of potency, and absorption issues are avoided. The center has a room dedicated to IV therapies with relaxing leather recliners. Patients can receive IV treatments on a regular basis or as desired and can save money by purchasing treatment packages. Bio Energy's other services include: Acupuncture, Classical Homeopathy, and Bio- Identical Hormone Replacement Therapy. The Bio Energy Medical Center is located at 4201 Varsity Drive, Suite A, Ann Arbor, MI 48108. They can be reached by phone at 734.995.3200 or by email at DrNeu@BioEnergyMedicalCenter.com. Their website is www.bioenergymedicalcenter.com. Crysta Coburn, a staff writer and editor for the Crazy Wisdom Community Journal, published The Queen of Clocks and other Steampunk Tales See page 30.

Dr. James Neuenschwander Three experts in the paranormal have teamed up as Full Moon Rising, offering spiritual cleansing of homes and businesses. Full Moon Rising's founder is Beverly Fish, a psychic medium, tarot reader, astrologer, and demonologist. She is also a retired historian and professor who lectures regularly at Washtenaw Community College and other venues on astrology, psychic development, and demonology. She discovered she was sensitive to the paranormal at only ten years old and has pursued these topics ever since. Omar Khayyam Yeldell is a \"modern-day shaman,\" spiritual consultant, empath, Reiki healer, web author, and paranormal investigator. He was born clairvoyant and empathic, and has studied the occult and related topics for decades. He is the founder of Desate Spiritual Consultations. Nicole Sutherland Shook is an empath, sensitive, intuitive, and paranormal investigator. She specializes in intuitively using homemade oil blends, sage, and invocations to banish negative spiritual entities. The three have partnered to address a widespread problem they see in the world: people are being affected by negative spirits, ghosts, demons and entities in their homes or other locations where they spend a lot of time, and have no idea where to even look for help. The trio believes that some problems: addiction, abuse, depression, and a generally unhappy home, can be a result of the influence of these negative energies and beings. Full Moon Rising will investigate and spiritually cleanse homes and businesses free of charge (donations accepted) out of a desire to help people experiencing problems with the paranormal. They are local to Ann Arbor but have travelled throughout Michigan and even into neighboring states to investigate and help solve paranormal problems. Sutherland Shook remarked that \"people think they can just sage everything away,\" and said that when in doubt, it's better to call in an expert rather than risk ramping up a problem with a negative entity by trying to banish it without the proper knowledge. They are happy to provide peace of mind, for example when someone \"just has a bad feeling\" about something happening in their home. They also lecture on the paranormal at different venues and are available for talks. More information is available at www.fullmoonrising.center.

Nicole Sutherland Shook can be reached at twilightwing@comcast.net or 734.395.8930. Sharon Lawlor recently moved her business, Tranquil Being, to a new space inside the new K.West Skin Body Soul building on Main Street in Ann Arbor. She works with healers, creatives, and entrepreneurs, providing deep healing sessions. She has been called a \"healer of healers,\" since she feels called to work with those who help others by holding space for them and helping them provide care for themselves that they so readily provide to others. She described herself as an \"energy alchemist\"; her sessions can consist of \"an eclectic mix of modalities\" catering to each client's body, mind, and spirit needs. Her work includes massage, energy work, shamanic healing, Chinese medicine, and heartfelt dialogue while showing deep empathy and attention to the person she is working with. She said a session \"could be just a massage, or it could be healing 20 years of pain and trauma held in the body,\" or anywhere in between depending on what the client needs and desires at the time. She takes time with each client to fully understand what she/he is going through and tailor the experience to help one achieve energy flow using her intuition and experience. She also sometimes provides referrals to other professionals who may be able to help with a specific issue. Lawlor is beginning to expand her reach with some local and online group workshops and doing some one-on-one work with clients online. She also writes a monthly spiritual column for a local magazine. Sharon Lawlor's healing space is located inside K.West Skin Body Soul at 415 North Main Street Ann Arbor, MI 48104. Her website, with online booking and links to her Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter accounts is at www.tranquilbeing.com. She can be reached by email at connect@tranquilbeing.com or by phone at 734.761.8753. Continued from page 29The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 30 New Books by Area Authors The Om of Medicine is a cannabis provisioning center located in downtown Ann Arbor. Aft er eight years in a third-floor space on Main Street, it moved to a larger first floor space across the street. This means easier access for medical cannabis patients and a beautiful new facility. There are three private consultation rooms for patient comfort and privacy. The patient lounge is also an art gallery, and they host free events for the community on a monthly basis. This is both for fun, explained Om's Outreach Director Lisa Conine, and to \"create more of a community feel and help break down the stigma\" of medical cannabis use. They host a comedy night at 9:00 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month, and a yoga class at 5:00 p.m. on the second to last Sunday. There is a full time MD on staff to assist with dosing and other aspects of treatment, but the facility does not issue medical cannabis cards. They can offer advice and referrals to people who want to attain cards, but Conine explained that they usually recommend having one's primary care physician sign the necessary paperwork if possible. If the PCP is not willing, there are clinics that specialize in helping patients attain their card. Since cannabis is still illegal at the federal level, many doctors are not willing to take a risk by signing the paperwork. The list of conditions that can legally be treated with cannabis expanded by 11 last summer, Conine said, and now includes: arthritis, chronic pain, IBS, Parkinson's disease, and others. Conditions that were already on the list include: cancer, glaucoma, Crohn's disease, PTSD, and others. The Om team is excited about the recent vote to legalize recreational cannabis use in Michigan, and continues to advocate for federal legalization, primarily so that more medical research can be done in order to help patients who may benefit. But Conine said they believe \"no one should go to jail for possession of a plant.\" She said there is potential for the center to provide recreational cannabis in the future, but that much needs to be put in place legally for this to be practical. For the moment, they are focused on making medical cannabis accessible and convenient for patients and reducing community fear and misconceptions about this medicine. Even when recreational cannabis becomes widespread and easier to attain, those with medical cannabis cards will still benefit, as they will be taxed at a much lower rate. No appointment is necessary for patients during Om's open hours, and the center features a \"to-go bar\" as well as online ordering. Cannabis cannot be legally mailed at this time, so medicine does need to be picked up. The Om of Medicine is located at 111 South Main Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48104. They are online at www.omofmedicine.org. They can be reached by phone at 734.369.8255 or by email at info@omofmedicine.org. Esthetician Katie Westgate opened K. West Skin Body Soul in a renovated historic home on Main Street in Ann Arbor in May. This is an expansion of her previous studio, K. West Skincare, which was located in Kerrytown for 3 years. The studio offers a variety of therapies. Westgate is a licensed esthetician influenced by the practice of Ayurveda and Chinese medicine, having worked at an Ayurvedic spa in New York. She provides healing facials and other skin treatments. She is also a nutrition coach and with her team is working on developing a holistic nutrition and lifestyle-coaching program inspired by destination spas. She explained that when people go to a destination spa, it's very easy for them to comply with all of their self-care goals because everything is being taken care of for them, but that when they return home and resume their daily routine and responsibilities, any progress is lost. She wants to help people find ways to embrace lifestyle changes they can stick to during the course of normal life. She is working toward certification as a Yoga instructor as well; an additional yoga studio space is planned and construction will begin as soon as permits are finalized. Westgate hopes to have it ready for use by summer of 2019. Angela Strong is another esthetician at K.West providing facials, hair removal, and nutrition coaching. Michaela Phan is an esthetician, massage therapist, hypnotherapist, and doula who provides a variety of therapies and treatments. Jessie Rauf is the front desk manager, but is also training for her Yoga teacher certification. The studio has space to begin offering organic manicures and pedicures, but is still looking for a qualified professional or two to fill that spot. They also have a full-body LED bed, which Westgate said uses light energy to detox the skin on the entire body. The menu of services continues to grow with Westgate's multi-talented staff. The studio's goal is to \"support our community in living a most radiant life from the inside out.\" Every detail of the physical space as well as each service is geared toward relaxation, releasing stress, and taking care of the whole person. K.West Skin Body Soul is located at 415 North Main Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48104. Free parking is available. They can be reached by phone at 734.436.8991 or by email at jess@kwestskinbodysoul.com. More information and online booking is available at www.kwestskinbodysoul.com. Lisa Conine Crysta Coburn, a staff writer and editor for the Crazy Wisdom Community Journal, published The Queen of Clocks and other Steampunk Tales in July. The book is an anthology of stories by seven authors including Coburn, and other Ann Arbor area authors. The theme tying the stories together is \"steampunk fairy tales.\" Coburn said, \"it brings together the magic of fairy tales and the allure of cogs and gears.\" While she has published stories in anthologies others have put together in the past, this is the first anthology she has taken on herself. While it will appeal to the steampunk community, she said that it would be of interest to others as well, as it is \"about having fun and being imaginative.\" She said it's not a children's book, but \"would rate it at PG-13,\" appropriate for teens and adults. When asked if there may be another book in the future, Coburn said she and the contributors, as well as other authors, have been pitching ideas. The book is available at Crazy Wisdom Bookstore and at Bookbound in Ann Arbor. It is also available as an ebook. Crysta Coburn can be reached via email at ck_coburn@ yahoo.com and her blog is http://crystakcoburn.blogspot.com/. Grand Rapids based author Marie Helena published her first book, The Night Blooming Jasmine in Your Heart, in June of 2017. It is the first book in a planned series. Helena explained that the book's message is to \"make something beautiful.\" This means, \"taking the challenges we encounter in life and not just solving them, but making something beautiful out of them by introducing love and light.\" The problems we have are part of our stories, she said, and are part of the beauty of those stories as they leave these \"trail[s] in your life.\" The book came out of a blog Helena writes called the Mystic Marks Blog. This in turn came out of a website she created with a web designer to sell spiritual bookmarks she designed (hence the name \"mystic marks\"). The web designer suggested a blog for the site, and Helena started writing prolifically on it. \"I write about whatever excites me,\" she said, and much of it focuses on spiritual lessons she has taken from her life experiences. In 2016, Carol Fix, an editor and publisher from San Diego, discovered the blog and suggested Helena publish her work in a book series. Fix said she felt that words of inspiration are desperately needed in our tumultuous time. A second book in the \"Mystic Marks series\" is in the finishing stages. Helena has since stopped making the bookmarks as her passion work has shifted to writing, but each blog post in the book is accompanied by a beautiful floral watercolor that Helena said represents the energy of the piece. These are by various artists. The cover, Helena said, is done in a soft texture specifically chosen by Fix, \"to harmonize with the gentleness of the book's reflections.\" It has been recommended by the US Book Review, and received 5-star ratings on the major online bookselling sites. Helena will be at The Mitten Word bookstore in Marshall, Michigan for an author presentation, reading, and book signing at 1:00 p.m. on Saturday, February 9. She will be at the Crazy Wisdom Community Room on Saturday, March 2 from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. for a presentation, reading, Q&A session, and book signing. The Night Blooming Jasmine in Your Heart is available for purchase at Crazy Wisdom Bookstore. Marie Helena's blog is at mysticmarks.blogspot.com. She can be reached via email at mysticmarks@sbcglobal.net or by phone at 616.363.5546. The Odyssey of the Slingshot Man was published in 2018 after a 53-year journey from a seed in the mind of Peter Van Eck to a finished book. The book's listed author, Van Eck, is a pseudonym for a family of three co-authors: Peter Van Eck, his wife Dr. Lani Van Eck, and his brother Jon Van Eck. All live in the Ann Arbor area. The book is a post-apocalyptic novel based in the near future, with heavy influence from the three authors' 50 years of spiritual experiences. When Peter was a young boy, his father became ill, resulting in Peter spending some time with Yogananda, the author of Autobiography of a Yogi . He said this experience activated his spiritual mission. He began working on the story of the Slingshot Man when he was a student at the University of Michigan in 1966. In the 1970s he co-owned Jacob's Ladder Gallery, a \"consciousness art and book store.\" His business partner, Steve Fisher, drew the picture on the cover of the book, which Peter said is a visual representation of a \"6 th chakra energy blast\" and features the Slingshot Man getting ready to literally fire his third eye with a slingshot made from a tree complete with roots. The drawing hung in the gallery for a year, Peter said. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 31 Continued on page 33 5340 Plymouth Rd.

Martin specializes in the Buddhist Jakata Tales, which are parables the Buddha told to his followers featuring animals, humans, monsters, and celestial beings representing the Buddha and his followers in previous lives. The tales are appropriate for adults and children. His most recent book, Before Buddha Was Buddha , focuses on Buddha struggling in past lives with temptation, self-doubt, and other challenges. Each story is followed by commentary explaining its relevance and lessons for modern people. On Saturday evening, March 23 at 7:00 p.m. at the Zen Buddhist Temple, Martin will be the main speaker in an evening of Buddhist storytelling. This is appropriate for all ages and families are welcome. Resident priest of the Ann Arbor temple, Haju Sunim, will also tell a Zen story. The cost for the event is $25 for adults and $15 for children 16 and under. Earlier in the day, from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Martin will teach a workshop on storytelling. It will focus on the core principles of storytelling, the differences between writing and storytelling, and inspiring others through storytelling. The workshop will also be held at the temple and the cost will be $50 per person. Martin will also give a Dharma talk at the regular 10:00 a.m. Sunday service on March 24. He is a teacher in the Soto Zen tradition, and Hayeon Kelli, a Dharma teacher at the temple, said he is a wonderful speaker. It is free to attend the service, though donations are welcome. The Zen Buddhist Temple of Ann Arbor is located at 1214 Packard Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48104. More information is on their website at www.zenbuddhisttemple.org/annarbor. Questions can be directed to annarbor@zenbuddhisttemple.org or 734.761.6520. Lani is an anthropologist specializing in Native American culture (and is part Native American herself). She co-founded the Wounded Knee Museum in Wall, South Dakota. She was also a contributing editor to an oral history made into a book by Ernie la Pointe, Chief Sitting Bull's only surviving great-grandson. She has been able to be part of a number of Native American spiritual ceremonies over the years. Jon is a professional potter, as well as a painter, sculptor, and woodworker. He served as a graduate teaching assistant in the Fine Arts department at Eastern Michigan University. After hearing Peter speak about his story ideas for many years, Jon and Lani decided to collaborate with him beginning in 2011. The story begins with the eruption of the 1300 square mile super volcano at Yellowstone, which is actually predicted to happen and is technically overdue. The main character, a middle-aged art professor, separated from his family by the disaster, goes on a journey across a destroyed United States to get back to them. The near-extinction event stimulates rapid evolution and he is spiritually activated as his true self - the Slingshot Man. He encounters vigilantes, contaminated water, wild dogs, looters, cities destroyed by volcanic ash, and much stranger things in his quest to get back to his family. The book deals with many aspects of Native American spirituality and prophecy, as well as Eastern spiritual practices and phenomena. Energy flows, chakras, and kundalini are described in detail, arising from the authors' own experiences. \"It was hard to put into words,\" Jon said. The description on the back of the book says it \"examines three coexisting species: those who use God consciousness, those who use earth magic, and humans.\" Peter explained that earth magic and God consciousness are very different, as earth magic or chi work \"within the illusion\" of our physical reality, but God consciousness is a higher concept that goes far beyond physical phenomena. This is the first in a series of books, and the authors hope the next will be ready in two to three years. There will be at least four and as many as seven.

Her in-home training business, Restored Alignment, offers one-on-one and small group training. She begins each client relationship with a movement assessment, which starts from the ground up. Many postural and movement problems, she explained, can be traced to the feet, which if misaligned will affect the entire chain of the body upward. She has, for example helped people with lower back pain by first correcting problems in the feet. She said: \"I design their program based on their individual needs to get them aligned, their posture back together, strengthen their muscles, and even get them to focus on where and what their body is doing in space.

Natalie Candela, PhD is a certified hypnotherapist and transformation coach. he said she has been on a spiritual journey for over 30 years, and in 2014 was led in a new life direction. Around that time she lost several close family members as well as her husband, lost her job, and lost all interest in the academic career she had been pursuing. She felt guided toward hypnotherapy \"as a tool for awakening and self-realization\" and re-examined and re-created her entire life. She took training and became a certified hypnotherapist in 2015 and started her practice, Awakened Hypnosis, in 2016. Since the age of seven, Candela said she knew with clarity that she was a teacher, and she views this change as a continuation of that life path in a new form. Through hypnosis and other tools, Candela helps her clients \"awaken to their talents and strengths, their wishes and dreams, their self-worth and self-love, their joy, their higher wisdom, and their life purpose.\" One of her specialties is Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique (QHHT), a technique developed by Dolores Cannon that helps people connect to their higher wisdom through past-life regression. The process, she explained, starts with a talk in which the client is asked about everything concerning them about their life and what they want to learn by the experience. Then, Candela helps them reach a state of hypnosis and connects them to past lives that may hold insight as well as their higher self. Questions are actually posed to the higher self to help answer the client's questions about their life direction, purpose, and anything else they may be wondering about. The entire process is recorded and given to the client so they can review it later. Candela is interested in working with anyone who is working on \"awakening to themselves and their potential.\" In addition to one-on-one sessions that take place for the most part in her home studio near Flushing, Michigan, she leads workshops. Past Life Exploration (stand-alone) workshops will be held on January 12 and 26, February 9 and 23, and March 9 and 23 , from 3 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. She will also offer a Lemurian Sisterhood Circle (for women only) on February 9 and March 9, from 5 p.m. - 7 p.m. For more information Natalie Candela's website is www.awakenedhypnosis. com.

Dr. Barbara Heller-Burstein, D.O. recently moved to the Ann Arbor area from Mount Pleasant and is seeing patients at the Parkway Center. She completed a fellowship in Metabolic Medicine and Nutritional Counseling in 2011, and is board certified in Anti-aging and Regenerative Medicine and Family Practice. She practiced Family medicine and Integrative medicine for over 20 years, and now is shifting to focus solely on Integrative medicine.

She can diagnose toxicity in the body, food intolerances, and other issues of something \"off-kilter\" in the body causing symptoms. Since she does not accept insurance and is an independent doctor, she can really take her time to get to know each patient as a whole person and understand what they are experiencing, thus developing a treatment plan that really addresses their needs. She is also available via phone and email between appointments to make sure the patient understands every part of their treatment plan and can get any questions answered. Burstein explained that while she does not accept insurance for treatment, some bloodwork and other lab testing might be covered by patients' insurance.

The Parkway Center is located at 2345 South Huron Parkway, Ann Arbor, MI 48197. Earth Elements in downtown Saline opened in the summer of 2018. Friends and co-owners Kristen Madrid and James McDonald were coworkers at a local bakery, and over time decided to combine their mutual interest in the metaphysical into a spiritual shop in the heart of Saline, which has never had a similar business. McDonald, a Reiki practitioner who already co-owned Renew Salon & Spa in Saline with his husband, had long dreamed of such a venture. Madrid had worked in a similar shop while in college and had been interested in the paranormal since the age of 11. Together, they had everything they needed to bring their vision to fruition. Madrid described Earth Elements as \"a mind/body/spirit shop\" and said the goal was to \"bring core enlightenment to Saline and the surrounding areas.\" She said \"Saline needed this type of place; people are open and ready for non-traditional spiritual development. Some are almost in the closet\" about their curiosity, and the store is intended as \"a welcoming safe space for people to explore their spiritual selves.\" The shop's offerings are multifaith and Madrid and McDonald aim to exclude no one. Eastern religions, Catholicism, and Christian items are present along with Pagan, Wiccan, and other traditions. They have crystals, candles, statues, incense and essential oils, loose herbs and teas, artwork, books, salt lamps, singing bowls, tarot and oracle cards, and authentic Native American fetishes and dreamcatchers. They sell soaps and body care products from Sea Witch botanicals, a small handmade brand based in Washington DC. They offer hot tea daily for visitors. The shop will offer events such as reiki trainings and will host artists and speakers. They do have a classroom available for local practitioners to rent.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 35 Longtime Ann Arbor resident Gil Oswald is finishing a doctoral program in Pastoral Counseling, was recently ordained as a priest by the Independent Old Catholic Church (not Roman Catholic), and is starting a spiritual direction practice. He previously volunteered as a chaplain at the University of Michigan Medical Center and at Ronald McDonald house. As an uncategorized chaplain he was able to work with people of different religious paths, and his avocation has been studying world religions. He described spiritual guidance as \"a conversation about trying to understand the spiritual side of yourself.\" He said that people in transition and people in crisis are often the ones seeking this type of guidance. A serious medical diagnosis for oneself, a spouse, or child can trigger a desire to seek God. Someone who was raised in a particular faith and left it but now feels something is missing from their lives might seek other spiritual paths or a reconnection with their original religion. Even someone currently active in a religious organization but having doubts or questions, but not wanting to acknowledge those doubts to their own pastors or priests, may benefit from conversation with a spiritual guide. Oswald is interested in talking with people of any faith or none to learn about and potentially help them on their journey. He is also available to officiate at weddings, bless houses, anoint the sick, and for burial services. He will have a small office space on State Street in Ann Arbor and will offer a weekly Eucharist (Holy Communion) on Sundays at noon where all are welcome. Rev.

Wahlen is a gifted healer and massage therapist, and is well-established and known in Ann Arbor's healing and bodywork subcultures. (He was featured in our cover story on Up and Coming Massage Therapists Under 40 in Issue #41, September thru December 2009 -- available on our archive at crazywisdomjournal.com.) As Billie Wahlen explains in the interview below, healing comes through a state of awareness that has taken him over a decade of practice to develop, under the guidance of a Sat Nam Rasayan master teacher. Wahlen now offers this kind of healing session to individuals at his office at the Parkway Center, or by going to an individual's home or office. Wahlen, 45 years old, has been practicing Kundalini Yoga and Meditation, as taught by Yogi Bhajan, since 2002. He founded Healing Through Awareness, and also A2 Kundalini Yoga. He leads Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and gong workshops, trainings and courses. And he has a private massage therapy practice. Raised in Buffalo, NY, he has been living in the Ann Arbor area since 1995. His daughter, Emma, is 25. She has a degree in culinary arts, and is now working in that field. Jonathan Ellis: You have done massage and bodywork in town for many years. Now you are also offering individual healing sessions called Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae. Tell us about this healing technique. Billie Wahlen: Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae means \"Deep Relaxation in the True Identity.\" It is typically done on a mat on the floor, the client stays fully clothed, and I sit in a meditative posture next to them, touching their arm lightly to connect into a therapeutic relationship. This form of healing works through the meditative mind. It is through becoming ultra-sensitive in the \"sacred space\" and allowing myself to expand my awareness enough to include everything my client/patient is experiencing, including their resistances. Resistances can be distractions, differentiation of sensations, preconceptions, conditions, boundaries, or limits. I am not sending energy, or directing, moving, or attempting to manipulate energy as is done in Reiki, Chakra Balancing, or other energy healing modalities. I enter a state of meditation and connect to my client in a therapeutic relationship. Within this sacred space called shuniya, the healing occurs. Mahankirin Kaur, a world renowned Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae healer, most beautifully explains the process as \"holding a neutral, contemplative state of awareness, being aware of everything - all sensations - and then allowing the resistances to change and/or release as you continue to hold your state of awareness.\" Jonathan Ellis: Can you tell us more about the sacred space of the Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae healer? Billie Wahlen: Shuniya means deep listening and silence. It is a state of consciousness. I learned to enter this state of consciousness through years of meditation practice. It is a meditative space of thoughtlessness, profound peace, and stillness. My teacher, Yogi Bhajan, Ph.D., was the master of Kundalini Yoga and Meditation, and he said, \"The mind of the Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae healer/practitioner becomes transcendent and in the vastness of this consciousness healing can occur.\" He calls shuniya a state of \"total surrender, becoming nothing and zero.\" An Interview with Billie Wahlen Sat Nam Rasayan \u00aeon Healing Technique By Jonathan Ellis Photography by Joni Strickfaden \"In Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae we simplify the idea of consciousness. We can only know and understand the universe through our experience, therefore we call the ability to stay alert 'to be conscious'. The more kinds of experience we can recognize the greater our consciousness will be.\" \u2014 Guru Dev Singhthe The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 37 Jonathan Ellis: Why might folks seek Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae healing? Billie Wahlen: Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae is a spiritual healing, like prayer. Simply put, during a session, I meditate and you feel better. The healer simply removes resistances, which stand in the way of the client being free to heal. People come for a variety of reasons: physical ailments, emotional support, and to benefit spiritually. One client I recently worked with said, \"I feel so clear-headed and spiritually clear as a result of these Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae exercises, it's amazing.\" JE: Does the client describe their condition for the healing?BW: Yes, sometimes. It is not necessary to know the client's disorder for healing to occur. It's the same as not needing to know someone's specific problems to be able to pray for them. JE: What are the origins of Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae? BW: For thousands of years, Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae was a secret yoga tradition. A master taught Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae in silence to his student. The process of training lasted several years, until the student could recognize and maintain a state of shuniya. Guru Dev Singh, Ph.D. is the living master of this tradition. Yogi Bhajan taught Guru Dev Singh with traditional training in Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae. JE: How was Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae taught? BW: It was always through transmission, the passing on of spiritual knowledge from teacher to student that healers were born. It was through being in the master's presence, learning through being in the teacher's aura and psychic influence that these states of meditation and profound spiritual experience were obtained. The spoken word was never necessary to transmit or practice it. The student would go into the state of shuniya and the teacher would recognize that the student recognized this state. It was then that the student would become a teacher and a healer. At one point Yogi Bhajan recognized that Guru Dev Singh could maintain the state of shuniya. JE: Now there is a broader method of learning Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae? BW: In 1988, Yogi Bhajan, who had previously been teaching worldwide for over 25 years, asked Guru Dev Singh to teach Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae publicly and to start a school where people could learn to heal. He sent him to Rome, saying, \"If you can conquer Rome you can conquer the world.\" Guru Dev is the first and only teacher in the lineage of Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae to develop a linear form to use for learning and practice. He has brought language to a system that was always taught in silence. In 1989, Guru Dev Singh started to teach Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae openly in Europe. Mahankirin Kaur has said, \"Yogi Bhajan was convinced that in times of great changes, the world would need a strong group of healers.\" He wanted to make the knowledge of the old Yogis accessible for all human beings. JE: Can you tell us about your own training in Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae? BW: I first took a class with Guru Dev Singh in 2002 at a Kundalini Yoga festival called Winter Solstice Sadhana Celebration in Florida. I was interested in this ancient yogic healing technique as I was new in the Kundalini Yoga community and by profession was beginning as a therapist to do massage and bodywork. In my training I took more of the esoteric approach to healing, i.e. Reiki, polarity therapy, energy balancing, etc. Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae was intriguing, although I had no idea what it was. The following year at the same event I had my first profound experience of these teachings. There were 400-450 people. I was at the back of the tent, partnered and attempting to understand what this healing and meditative state was all about. I remember thinking nothing was happening and I wasn't able to do this right. At the end of a three-hour class, intermixed with meditations and practice healings, I had a strong pain in the left side of my heart center. It felt like a strong muscular pain in the intercostal muscles. Guru Dev said, \"Well, that's all we have time for today. There is still a pain in the left side of the heart, but don't worry, I'll take care of it later.\" I was amazed. I thought the healing, that was supposed to take place, was between my partner and myself. Did he just do a group healing on all of us? How is that even possible? Did everyone experience this pain I was experiencing? Later I discovered I had just experienced a group healing done by the Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae Master. This was my first noticeable reaction in a Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae class and my first direct experience of its effects. JE: And you continued this training for over a decade? BW: I continued to search for this meditative state called shuniya and practiced meditation daily at home for years. I participated in large group classes at Solstice gatherings, both summer and winter, every year since 2002. I have been to Guru Dev's intensives in India, Los Angeles, New Mexico, Mt. Shasta in California, and Virginia. The intensives are really powerful, usually about 100 - 200 people, practicing six to eight hours a day. I clearly and distinctly recognized the state of shuniya at an intensive in 2014 in New Mexico. While in a deep state of meditation Guru Dev exclaimed, \"That's shuniya!\" I recognized this space from previous meditative experiences and now could distinguish it from other experiences. Through personal and group meditation practices, I've been training to be able to stabilize this state of consciousness, and this training will continue for the rest of my life. I have been blessed to have Guru Dev as my teacher. He has often given me specific meditations to do that have \"In 1968, Yogi Bhajan knew we were on the cusp of a great change and the techniques that have been held in secret needed to come out and be shared with the world. For the next 37 years his mission was to \"create teachers, not to gain students.\" Kundalini Yoga is currently taught on every continent, in 81 countries, and in at least 15 languages.\" \u2014 Billie Wahlen (Mohinder Singh) \"In all meditative and yogic traditions, inner silence was respected as the highest achievement. In our daily lives this seems very difficult and only achievable by higher yogis. Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae teaches an amazingly easy approach to inner silence. It helps you to stay silent in the hustle and stress of your daily life. It is surprising to see your conflicts being resolved through this inner state.\" \u2014 Mahankirn Kaur Continued on page 38The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 38 helped me with a variety of problems. Receiving Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae from Guru Dev was a very profound experience. To explain briefly, he put me in the present moment, fully, I mean, fully! Every breath, every step, and every action was fully in the present moment for some time. In August 2016 at a five-day intensive in Mt. Shasta, California, I tested for my Level 1 Certification. It involved doing a healing in the presence of Guru Dev. He asked me to heal a person's stomach. I related to this situation while in meditation and allowed the sensations I was experiencing. JE: Can you talk more about the Sikh roots of Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae and Kundalini Yoga? BW: Yogi Bhajan taught Kundalini Yoga, the Yoga of Awareness, openly for the first time in recorded history, and probably even longer. It is said the roots of Kundalini Yoga go back thousands of years, back when information was only passed down through generations orally. The great sages and yogis of that time figured out how to manage the energy of the body through techniques and control of the breath, sound, body, and mind.Billie Wahlen Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae Continued from page 37 In 1968, Yogi Bhajan knew we were on the cusp of a great change and the techniques that have been held in secret needed to come out and be shared with the world. For the next 37 years his mission was to \"create teachers, not to gain students.\" Kundalini Yoga is currently taught on every continent, in 81 countries, and in at least 15 languages. Yogi Bhajan was a deeply devoted Sikh. Sikhism is the world's 5th largest religion. He inspired thousands to follow the Sikh Dharma, the way of life of a spiritual seeker. The connection between Kundalini Yoga and Sikhism is through the current of divine sounds, which is called the Naad.Kundalini Yoga and Meditation Level 1 Teacher Training 2018-2019 \"Teaching is undergoing a change. In the age of Pisces, humans approached God, making an effort to cleanse and purify themselves in every way. Now, in the Age of Aquarius, it is God who approaches humankind and we need only be aware of it and allow it to happen. Spiritual practices are no longer as rigid or difficult as before; they are however, more subtle. In this age, it is not a question of trying to know but rather of recognizing that knowledge is within us.\" \u2014 Yogi Bhajan \"Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae is a spiritual form of healing using awareness as the only tool.\" \u2014 Yogi Bhajan The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 39 We practice Naad Yoga, merging with the divine through sound. The Sikh Gurus, which began with Guru Nanak, shared ecstatic poems sung while in highly elevated states of consciousness. We practice these same songs and poems to get us into the same elevated states. There are some sounds, names of the divine that are repeated in meditation. This practice helps us go into the subtle space of shuniya so we can heal others through Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae. JE: You are also a Kundalini Yoga instructor and Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae comes from that tradition. How are they related? BW: I have been teaching Kundalini Yoga in Ann Arbor since 2004. The technology of Kundalini Yoga works directly on our reserve capacity of energy. We tap into the life force within us for vitality and strength. Regular practice of the techniques of Kundalini Yoga increases our intuition and our ability to become more sensitive. Yogi Bhajan often said we need to become self-sensory human beings to keep from going berserk in the information age. Using the meditation practices in Kundalini Yoga, we can effectively enter the sensitive space to heal others through Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae. JE: How long is an individual Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae session with you? BW: Appointments are forty-five minutes to one hour, while the actual Sat Nam Rasayan\u00ae session takes about 30 minutes.JE: Your spiritual name is Mohinder Singh. How was that received? BW: I received my spiritual name while Yogi Bhajan was still alive, in 2003. Mohinder Singh means \"I am the Lion who is the Love of God.\" It is said if we meditate on our spiritual names we will reach our destiny faster in this life. JE: Thank you Mohinder. BW: Thank you Jonathan. Billie Wahlen (Mohinder Singh) can be reached at starbillie@gmail.com or by phone at 734-276-6520.

Navtej Johar: Ann Arbor originally became our home when my family migrated to the U.S. in 1984. I studied, danced, and taught yoga here until the late 90's, after which I began advanced studies in yoga and dance, plus ventured into the international dance scene. Over the last two decades, I have been spending time between the USA, Europe, and India. Since 2012, I'd been in Berlin on a research fellowship on embodied practices at the Freie University, plus I'd spent time in India due to my LGBT activism. After alandmark victory earlier this year, which led to the revocation of a 19th century,British law that criminalized homosexuality, I am now back home in Ann Arbor. Yoga has a long history in this city and it is a delight to be teaching students who've been seriously practicing yoga for the last thirty plus years. It is deeply satisfying to be working with students who have been practicing for so long and are pursuing a serious quest. I finally opened the Poorna Center for Embodied Practices, with the aim to offer not just practice, but also deep study in Yoga texts, many of them rather unconventional, if not radical. Holly Makimaa: How did you come to study yoga? Na vtej Johar: As a child, I was very curious about yoga. This was a time when yoga was not too popular, there was very little information about it, and teachers were not easy to come by. Yes, even in India. For centuries, yoga was seen as an obscure sub-culture that most middle-class households remained wary of. In 1980, I decided to move to Madras (now Chennai), to train in Indian classical dance (Bharatanatyam), and at the back of my mind I hoped that I'd also find a yoga teacher there. The very first week I was there, I was in a bus traveling back from my dance school and this young man sat next to me. We started talking and he said he was a yoga teacher. He invited me to come meet his teacher the next day. The teacher was TKV Desikachar.Holly Makimaa: Who was TKV Desikachar? How has his work influenced yoga in America? Navtej Johar: I feel so very fortunate that I found Desikachar. To this day, I get goose bumps when I remember how I found him. The greatness of the man was that he believed in being ordinary. Underneath which, he hid a lot of subtlety, sensitivity, insight, and power. An engineer by profession, he viewed the dynamic body from that informed perspective and his style was all about adaption\u2014a blend of rigor and gentleness. He guided, facilitated, and allowed each student to find his or her own sense of rightness from the inside. He was not enamored by picture-perfect yoga asanas or taken in by any lofty idealisms. He wholeheartedly believed in and made us all rely upon the infinite intelligence and sensitivity of the material body. Thus, the thrust was not to tame or perfect the body. He had too much love and appreciation for the physical body. For him, yoga was the working of the body, mind, breath, and \"something more\" in tandem. However, this \"something more\" was never given a definition or a form. Completely secular, he outright kept God and religion very far away from his practice and teachings. There was not even an OM sign in the Krishnamacharya Yoga Mandiram; neither did he ever wear the caste marks on his forehead. To me, he was a true follower of Samkhya, the materialist, non-theist philosophy that forms the basis of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras. Holly Makimaa: How does your dance background inform your yoga practice and teaching of it?Navtej Johar: It wasn't initially easy to marry dance with yoga because, to me, they were fundamentally different from each other. While one is an introverted, self-observing practice, the other is projective, extroverted, and converts the body into an image. It took me more than a decade of serious practice and study in both to reconcile the two. One of the obvious things that dance lends to my yoga practice is flow. It allows me the experience of merging action with awareness, and may I add, even poetry, and the ability to center my attention on specific and isolated parts of my body. I am convinced that each little part of the body has both an autonomous drive or initiative, which we need to honor, and might also have a \"story\" to tell. A story that can be told and fulfilled through shapes, sounds, and movement-textures. Also, dance has given me the capacity to engage and evoke imagery. Dance poetics has taught me to liberally free-associate, thus my teaching and practice is rife with imagery, which then translates to language and word-imagery. To me, linguistics and yoga are inextricably intertwined! It is not a passive practice of believing and following, but truly a practice of organizing, articulating, and absorbing thought. Therefore it is a practice of body, breath, and speech. Holly Makimaa: You developed a yogic method called BARPS. What inspired this? How do you see it adding to the lineage you trained in?Navtej Johar: All that I mention above ushered me to develop BARPS as a method of asana practice. BARPS is an acronym for the processes that I feel are integral to mindful asana: Bracing of body against surface. Aligning of joints. Rotation of joints to your own sense of rightness and satisfaction. Poising of breath and attention. And then finally Stretching into a fulsome asana with all these conditions fulfilled. The form is integral to embodied practice, but the \"rightness\" of which may be synthetically experienced from the inside as opposed to being image-driven from Dance YogaMarrying An interview with Navtej J ohar & For centuries, yoga was seen as anobscure sub-culture that most middle-class households remained wary of.eAn engineer by profession, he viewed the dynamic body from that informed perspective and his style was all about adaption \u2014 a blend of rigor and gentleness.eThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 41 the outside. Maintaining the integrity of form and keeping it untouched and safe from the pressures of cosmetic-form is in itself a yoga practice. One of the main factors that has led to BARPS is my firm belief in the innate intelligence of the body. This belief defies the Cartesian logic of mind-over-body, or the idealist doctrines that view Spirit as not only superior but even external to the body. To me, Spirit is a contiguous extension of the physical body. Spirit is sensitivity. A sensitivity that can be realized through embodied practice that mindfully tempers, refines, and distills the senses, along with their observation (by the self) simultaneously, or rather symbiotically. Thus, my practice is a practice of honing sensitivity. Holly Makimaa: After all your years of teaching, what is it about yoga that still captivates you? Na vtej Johar: It is the infinite intelligence and sensitivity of the body that captivates me. And this sensitivity is not a static station but an ever evolving, ever deepening, process. And this sensitivity does not involve the body alone, but permeates to all that surrounds us. Most of all it relies upon the care and choice of words and images with which we internalize this exteriority; the words and images with which we store the outside in our minds. And then how we may be able to still the perpetual flux of these mental images. To me, that is yoga, and not just that, it intrinsically requires a touch of poetics to quell the agitation of the mind in order to arrive at an experience of absorption. This is an idea that gets developed in Tantra according to which the spiritual experience is intrinsically poetic. Holly Makimaa: You will be offering an upcoming yearlong training in the method you teach. What can people expect to receive in this training that might be different from most yoga teacher trainings in America? Na vtej Johar: It will involve a lot of guided practice in asana, pranayama, and meditation over time; it will involve adaption, experimentation, and self-observation. The students will be required to maintain a journal throughout. There will be considerable reading, which we will try and keep concise, plus lectures by experts. We will cover the history of modern Yoga, materialist Indian philosophies that directly inform both Patanjala and Hatha yoga, history and debates between the materialist and idealist philosophies of India, and the systematic overwriting of materialist philosophies over time. In addition to the major, and more popular Yoga texts, we will touch upon the minor texts as well. We will also briefly study Sanskrit Poetics and Linguistics. The aim of this Teacher Training program is to interest and inform practitioners of Yoga history and its political ramifications, while simultaneously inspiring them to rely upon their ever-guiding, ever-revealing, intelligent, sensitive, and insightful bodies as repositories of infinite beauty, repose (or sukha), and clarity.

Whether you're a seasoned yogi or getting ready to roll out your mat for the first time, here you'll find a variety of useful tips from local yoga instructor, Katie Hoener. YOGA COLUMNPhoto by Hilary Nichols Namaste, Katie, I love wheel pose but have recently hurt my wrist (not doing yoga!). When I went into the pose the other day, I nearly fell. Is there something I can do to get the same benefits while I am recuperating? Joy, Scio TownshipDear Joy,I am so sorry to hear about your injury, and glad to hear that you are taking care of yourself. I am not the best at taking time off myself, so kudos to you for listening to your body! Wheel, Urdhva Dhanurasana, is a challenging posture that always is taken with caution, as it is quite the opener for the front side of the body, and taxing on the wrists and shoulders. So, allowing that break for the wrists is important at this moment, and there are additional ways to find those openings while supporting your recovery. A wonderful alternative to a Wheel is a Bridge, or Setubandhasana, a posture that opens the heart and the shoulders without putting strain on the wrists. Come onto the back, drawing the shoulder blades toward one another, arms by your side. With the feet planted, hip distance apart, on an inhale begin to lift the pelvis. Find the amount of lift that is comfortable and meets your needs. Some days this may be level with the thighs, while others the hips may continue to lift, continuing to expand through the heart. If the hips find this more elevated space, the heart and shoulder opener more closely aligns with the Urdhva Dhanurasana that you are missing. With awareness on the wrist, it may be possible to interlace the hands under the body, which will further open the front side of the body. Namaste, Katie,I was late for a coffee date with a friend the other day (not my first late appearance) and my friend said to me, \"I understand you... you are SO Vata.\" I laughed, and I have heard the term in a yoga class we take regularly, but what are they talking about? Shamekia, Ann ArborDear Shamekia,I have a lot of Vatas in my life, and they are wonderful people. All of the doshas, the three Ayurvedic constitutions, have lovely qualities. Ayurveda is one of the oldest known forms of holistic medicine, which dates back more than 3,000 years. One way that Ayurveda looks to heal and support each of us is to determine our primary, or dominant type, and then work with us to bring our doshas into balance. Vata, which you were described as, is the airy dosha. Vatas are typically seen as a bit more flighty (the airy nature!) and often feel cold. They also have a high tendency toward the creative and are flexible in both body and mind. Pitta is the fire dosha. Pittas are generally seen as headstrong, if not stubborn, and are overly warm. Though our Pitta friends are seen as intense at times, they are also often quick learners and ready to lead. Lastly, though in no way least, is Kapha the earth dosha. Kaphas are grounded and stable. They are often very routine oriented and reliable. Our Kapha friends are compassionate and loyal friends. Most of us are a combination of these, and at certain points may be close to balance between the three doshas. It can be interesting to take a dosha quiz online, or attend a workshop. There is a TON of learning to be done in regards to Ayurveda and the doshas, as each has foods and drinks that help bring balance. Dive deeper if you so choose!Namaste, Katie, I recently had a sub in my regular class, and he kept stating to \"take the bind if you choose,\" and I was not in a place to see what that meant. I did my best to stay within my practice, and have not seen this instructor since. Can you give me some insight? Don, Ann Arbor Dear Don, Good job not getting out of your space. This is something that every once in a while gets me too! This desire to know everything that is going on outside of me, rather than focusing on what is going on inside. Maintaining that focus can be so challenging. Now, to address those binds. In many yoga postures there are ways to wrap the arms around the body, and unite them in some way. At times the hands hold, or interlace, and at times we can hook fingers. The method to bring the hands together is a choice that we make when we choose to engage in a bind. In a public class, yoga teachers will often remind students of the option without leading into the bind because binds are a very personal process. Not to say that you shouldn't try them, they are wonderful openers for the body, and a great way to look into deepening your practice. As you have stated in your question, they also take a lot of looks within, and staying true to our own practice. Pictured above is Utthita Parsvakonasana, Extended Side Angle, with the bind. It is important to warm up before trying a bind, so that you do not feel defeated, and to move into the space at a pace that is gentle. In Utthita Parsvakonasana, the bottom arm wraps down and toward the back of the body, while the top arm comes around and meets the other. It is important in this bind to keep the heart open and lifted. If you have further questions about binds, and would like to explore further, perhaps schedule a one on one session, or place yourself near the instructor if they are modelling. Enjoy opening up your practice! Katie Hoener is an RYT 500, receiving her 200 and 500 hour trainings. She is also a Licensed Master Social Worker.

You can support our local farmers and growers even in the winter months. Most of us know that eating fresh food grown locally is better for both our bodies and our environment and like to support farmers during traditional growing and harvesting seasons. We also know that the average backyard farmer can't grow produce in the snow. How-ever, there are many local farmers who can grow all year long due to having hoop houses (greenhouses) that keep the air and soil warmer than what most Michiganders are experiencing in mid-January. BRRR! This technique of greenhouse growing allows the consumer to benefit from locally grown food even in the cold months. So what kind of produce can you expect at a winter farmer's market? Potatoes, greens, sprouts, herbs, garlic, spinach, sprouts, lettuces, car - rots, as well as pork, beef, lamb, chicken, and honey to start! By shop-ping at a local farmer's market you will eat seasonally fresh and ripe produce. What could be better than that? They also sell storable foods such as winter squash, dried beans, grains, and dried herbs. Think of your grandma's root cellar. Jams, jellies, canned goods, baked goodies, cheese and dairy products, pickles, and even jerky can be preserved along with sauerkraut and kimchi. Most markets also carry art, hand-made crafts, furniture, jewelry, and body care products. What are you waiting for? Find a winter market near you!

Are you getting adequate amounts? Are they benefiting you in a positive way? These are important questions when it comes to nutrition. To ensure that you are on the right path to living a long healthy life, I invite you to pay close attention to the next bite you take. Proper nourishment is essential for the healthy development and growth of children, as well. Let's set a good example and teach our children what healthy really tastes like. There's a quote I love by one of my favorite health experts, Dr. Mark Hyman. \"What you put at the end of your fork is more powerful than anything you'll find at the bottom of a pill bottle.\" Many common health problems can be prevented and alleviated with good nutrition. You're likely to develop a medical condition (such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease or cancer) from a poor diet, although, many people have been able to ditch their medications after making changes to their diet. It's possible! Remember the old saying, \"An apple a day, keeps the doctor away?\" The choices we make when it comes to food can have a great impact on our overall health. Poor nutrition can deplete the immune system, increase the risk of developing diseases, affect physical performance, mental clarity, mood, and contribute to a lack of energy. Our body requires an abundance of nutrients. A nutrient is a source of nourishment, a component of food. Macronutrients are nutrients we need in relatively large quantities. This includes protein, carbohydrates, fat, fiber, and water. Micronutrients are nutrients we need in smaller quantities. This includes vitamins and minerals. There are seven classes of nutrients: Pr otein Carboh ydrates F at Fiber Vit amins Miner als W ater Protein Protein is a building block for bones, muscles, skin, and blood. It builds and repairs tissue. If you exercise or run regularly, it's important to get an adequate amount of protein before and after. Hair and nails are mostly made of protein. Did you know that hemoglobin is also a protein? You can find protein in a variety of foods. Grass-fed beef, organic chicken, turkey, and wild caught fish are a great choice, but you can also find protein in greek yogurt, nuts, beans, and eggs. Protein is essential for weight loss. Replacing carbohydrates and fat with protein reduces the hunger hormone, leptin. This can make weight loss easier. Carbohydrates Also known as saccharides, or what most of us refer to as, carbs. Carbohydrates consist of sugar and starch. They are a major food source that provides long lasting energy. Bread, pasta, potatoes, rice, beans, and cereals are high in carbohydrates. Foods that are high in glycemic index (GI) enter the bloodstream as glucose or sugar very quickly. This is why runners load up on a lot of pasta before a race. Consuming a lot of carbs isn't always a good thing, though. White breads, pastas, rice, and cereals contain a lot of sugar, which makes it high-GI. Switching to low-GI foods (or The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 46 what I refer to as complex carbs) such as brown rice, sweet potatoes, sprouted grain breads, lentil or pea pasta, will improve your lifestyle and chances at maintaining a healthy weight. Many fruits and vegetables contain carbohydrates. Many people will avoid eating fruit because of the natural sugar that is found in it. There's a difference between natural and processed sugar though. Fruit contains fructose, but it's also packed with vitamins, nutrients, antioxidants, and fiber. Processed sugar, like glucose, contains chemicals. Too much glucose can cause your pancreas to produce too much insulin and result in low sugar levels. We all can benefit from incorporating fresh fruit into our daily diet, but try to avoid the processed sugar. Fat There are two categories of fat. There is \"good\" fat, which is monounsaturated and polyunsaturated. Then there is \"bad\" fat, which is saturated and trans. Unsaturated fats such as avocados, nuts, seeds, nut butter, coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil, whole eggs (don't skip the yolk, that's where all the nutrients are!), dark chocolate, and fatty fish such as salmon, herring, or tuna (high in Omega-3) are considered to be healthy. They have also been linked to promoting heart health by lowering cholesterol and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, but recommended to consume in moderation as the calorie content is still high. \"Bad\" trans fat foods that you want to avoid are: baked goods, margarine, creams, crackers, microwave popcorn, potato and corn tortilla chips, and fried foods. Anything made with hydrogenated vegetable oils are unhealthy. These foods put you at high risk for developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Saturated fats are animal fat products such as cream cheese, butter, and whole milk products and should be replaced with unsaturated fats. Fiber There are two types of fiber. Soluble and Insoluble. Both types have major health benefits. Soluble fiber dissolves in water and becomes gelatinous, slowing down digestion and allowing the body to absorb vital nutrients. The benefits are a reduction in cholesterol, especially levels of LDL, regulation of sugar intake, and improvement of the immune and digestive system. The best source of soluble fiber includes oats or oat bran, nuts, seeds, legumes, lentils, peas, and some fruits and vegetables like berries and carrots. Insoluble fiber does not dissolve in water, but stays fibrous. It helps food waste pass through the digestive system, and adds bulk to the stool. The benefits include regularity in bowel movements, prevention of constipation, and a rapid movement in the elimination of waste through the colon. Food sources of insoluble fiber include vegetables (especially dark leafy greens), whole wheat, nuts, seeds, and vegetable and fruit skins. Vitamins Vitamins are a class of organic substances needed for normal cell function, growth, and development. Our body requires essential vitamins in order to work properly. Vitamins keep metabolism in check. Most vitamins need to come from the foods that we eat because our body either doesn't produce enough of them, or it doesn't produce any at all. This can lead to a vitamin deficiency, which may cause health problems, which may then lead to a supplement being needed. E ach vitamin plays a big role in the body. Eating a well-balanced diet is crucial for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The body needs an adequate amount of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grain, nuts, seeds, and dairy. This will reduce the chance An Apple A Day: The Seven Forms of Nutrition Our Body Needs To ensure that you are on the right path to living a long healthy life, I invite you to pay close attention to the next bite you take. Remember the old saying, An apple a day, keeps the doctor away? The choices we make when it comes to food can have a great impact on our overall health. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 47 of developing heart disease, cancer, and osteoporosis. Below is a list of foods to eat with the best source of vitamins: Vit amin A- Helps your body form healthy teeth, skin, bones, and soft tissue. Carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, spinach, kale, collard greens, and apricots are a good source of Vitamin A. Vit amin B-6, B-9, and B-12- Essential for formation of red blood cells and proper nerve function. Maintains brain function, prevents anemia, and supports metabolism. Foods high in B-6 and B-12 are: eggs, milk, meat, poultry, seafood, and fish. Foods that are high in B-9 (folic acid) include leafy greens, poultry, fortified cereals, citrus fruits, rice, beans, pasta, and breads. Vit amin C- Also known as ascorbic acid\u2014an antioxidant that helps the body absorb iron, maintain proper immune function, and promote healthy teeth and gums. Good sources of Vitamin C are fresh fruits (especially citrus) and vegetables such as dark leafy greens, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and bell peppers. Vit amin D- The \"sunshine\" vitamin. Spending time out in the sun is a great way to get your daily fix of Vitamin D, but getting nutrients through food is also important. It supports healthy bones and the immune system, as well as calcium absorption. Your richest source of Vitamin D will come from sunshine, but these foods also provide it: salmon, herring, trout, oysters, milk, eggs, cheese, mushrooms, and fortified cereals. Many people don't absorb enough Vitamin D through sunlight and food. Sometimes a supplement is needed. Vitamin E- Another powerful antioxidant. It protects cells against damage and repairs damaged cells. Foods high in Vitamin E include: dark leafy greens like spinach and swiss chard, bell peppers, asparagus, sunflower seeds, and almonds. Vit amin K- Important for the formation of blood clots. Helps prevent excessive bleeding. Foods that are high in Vitamin K are: leafy greens, romaine, asparagus, broccoli, Brussels sprouts. Minerals Much like vitamins, minerals support the body in growth, development, and maintaining overall health. The minerals in our diet are essential for metabolism and proper functioning of the body. They are the building blocks for developing strong teeth and bones, skin, hair, blood, muscles, and nerve function. Minerals are also responsible for the energy provided from the foods we eat. Below are the major minerals that the body needs. Calcium- Needed for strong teeth and bones, clotting of blood, energy, and strengthening of the immune system. Dairy is an excellent source of calcium, especially cheese and yogurt. Leafy greens such as spinach, swiss chard, and kale also provide this much needed mineral. Chloride- Needed f or balancing out the fluids in the stomach. Helps control stomach acid. Pink Himalayan salt is a major source. It contains about 98% sodium chloride. It can also be found in vegetables such as tomatoes, olives, and celery. Magnesium- Needed t o maintain normal muscle and nerve function. Supports the immune system, aids in regulating blood glucose levels, produces energy and protein, and also helps maintain a regular heartbeat. Most magnesium comes from vegetables such as dark leafy greens. Other foods include nuts, legumes, soy, and whole grains. Phosphorus-This abundan t mineral is in every cell of the body. Most of it is found in the formation of teeth and bones. Other functions include how the body uses carbohydrates and fat. The main food source of phosphorus is in the protein of milk and meat. Fruits and vegetables contain a very small amount. P otassium- A type of electrolyte. The body needs this in order to work properly in building proteins and muscle, maintaining normal body growth, controlling the balance of acid, nerve impulses, and energy production. Potassium is found in several foods. All meats and seafood are a great source. Winter squash, legumes, and potatoes (with the skins), citrus fruits, bananas, kiwi, and apricots are all good choices. Dried apricots provide more potassium than fresh. Milk, nuts, and yogurt are also a great source of potassium. Sodium- Needed f or proper use of nerves and muscles. Sodium controls the pressure and volume of blood. Getting an adequate amount is helpful for a productive workout. Sodium is found in most foods, naturally. The most common form is in table salt. Others include soy sauce and bouillon. Added amounts of sodium can be found in processed meats, canned soups, frozen dinners, and fast food. Too much can lead to serious health issues. Sulfur- Needed for optimal body function, even though it's the one mineral we don't hear about very often. It's known as a healing mineral. It's a component of two important amino acids: methionine and cysteine. An excellent source of sulfur is found in organic eggs, grass-fed meats, wild caught salmon, nuts, leafy greens, and garlic. Water We can't live without it! The human body contains up to 60% water. It's important to stay hydrated since the body loses water naturally through the kidneys, lungs, and intestines. Water is essential for the functioning of the body. It maintains the balance of fluids, aids digestion, improves cognitive function, increases energy, detoxifies our system, flushes out the kidneys, regulates body temperature, promotes weight loss, delivers and absorbs nutrients, improves circulation, boosts metabolism, improves skin, helps physical performance, prevents headaches, helps constipation, and produces saliva. Pure water doesn't contain any added nutrients, but will absorb certain minerals. Filtered water is always best. Ther e you have it. The seven forms of nutrition. Eating healthy doesn't have to be hard or boring. Incorporate a wide variety of fresh fruits and vegetables into your diet every day, in every color of the rainbow. A balanced diet along with exercise and plenty of rest is vital for good health and longevity. We are blessed to have an abundance of high nutrient foods to provide the nourishment our body needs to thrive, maintain a healthy weight, and avoid disease. Eat well. Be well.

By Joann\u00e9e DeBruhl When my business partners and I bought the property that Stone Coop Farm lives on in November of 2011, I knew we had to save it as farmland for future generations. Our farm is on 30 acres, but it is zoned residential. 1000 new homes in four new subdivisions are being built on both sides of us. I can hear the excavation equipment every day. A wastewater treatment plant is being built and the high-pressure sewer line will be connecting these subdivisions along our property line. Developers are approaching us to sell the farm, so that more homes can be built. The value of our land is increasing as residential lots, not as farmland. I know my mission is to save the farm, but that often feels like an insurmountable task, given what's going on around me. I was faced with the mounting pressure to sell our farmland for development to help pay off our loans, but in 2014 I had an epiphany. It was a grey and cold winter day. I was concerned about how to make the farm profitable and felt the job of saving the farm and paying off our loans was just too gigantic for me to accomplish. I imagined writing a check to get us completely out of debt. I then took a deep breath and submerged myself in what it would feel like if I owned the farm outright. I looked out my window and the snow started to fall; big fat snowflakes. My mind jumped to the thought \"Stone Coop Farm will bless as many people as these snowflakes.\" The more I let it sink in, the more joy I felt. I knew I could do this.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 48 The idea of creating a nonprofit working farm and learning center started to germinate. We had been supporting new farmers for years through our scholarship program, so they could attend Michigan State's Organic Farmer Training Program. We had been supporting our community with classes, events, presentations, donations, and collaborations since we started in 2011. I had been so focused on my efforts to continue supporting our community, that I forgot that our community is here to support us as well. I realized that my Succession Plan for Stone Coop did not require me to buy the land personally. We could create a nonprofit that would allow our community to ensure the longevity of Stone Coop. I could continue to train new farmers how to be successful business owners. I could help my staff become audacious, entrepreneurial business owners, so that one day, when I am ready to retire, there will be someone already associated with Stone Coop Farm that can take over. Did you know that the average age of U.S. farmers is almost 60 and our farmland is disappearing at an alarming rate? So much so, that the U.S. State Department and USDA are concerned about our national food security. If we lose our farmland to residential and commercial development, where will we grow our food? Additionally, new farmers are having a difficult time finding affordable farmland. Many farmers' children don't want to farm, so their land and that generational knowledge of how to farm is being lost. I didn't want this to happen to Stone Coop. Besides being a nonprofit working farm, we also offer Working Shares. Each season we offer 25 to 30 Working Shares where folks work two hours a week, from April through October. In return they receive a Market Share to buy produce, meat, eggs, and anything else we have at the farm. These folks are amazing! They come from all walks of life and all ages, from families with little kids to retirees. They help us in so many ways; weeding, watering, harvesting, carpentry, spreadsheet entry, advertising, deliveries, etc. They bring a joy and enthusiasm to the farm that makes it a vibrant community of people making this world a better place to live. We offer loads of classes and events too. We have two beautiful spaces available that are used for summer camps, nature art collages, storytelling, earning scout badges, music, and other adventures on the farm. Our covered outdoor pavilion is where we offer our on-farm markets. Our beautifully restored 1907 barn, which we moved here from a farm near Jackson, MI, is also perfect for hosting events such as workshops, weddings, birthdays, graduations, and more. Farm Classes are offered all year and include topics like gardening, raising backyard chickens, fermentation, cooking, and nutrition. We also offer homeschool classes and field trips, bee and farm tours, events for kids, and host school groups. Four Seasons of Fresh Inspiration at Brighton's Stone Coop Organic Farm & Learning Center From left to right - Joann\u00e9e (staff), Linda (working share), Beth (staff), Heidi (working share), Tim (staff) and Jake (staff), and we can't forget the farm dog, Roxy (she's staff too ). When my business partners and I bought the property that Stone Coop Farm lives on in November of 2011, I knew we had to save it as farmland for future generations. I was faced with the mounting pressure to sell our farmland for development to help pay off our loans, but in 2014 I had an epiphany. Did you know that the average age of U.S. farmers is almost 60 and our farmland is disappearing at an alarming rate? So much so, that the U.S. State Department and USDA are concerned about our national food security.Stone Coop understands that all farmers need community support. That is why we partner with four certified organic meat farmers to sell their meat at our farm stand. We offer their pastured raised chicken, beef, pork, lamb and turkey as well as our own certified organic vegetables, fruits, herbs, and heritage breed chickens and eggs. We have four hoop houses that allow us to grow and sell produce all year long and offer honey, sprouts, and fermented products from local farmers too. At the beginning of March 2018, I woke up early on a Friday morning inspired. I just love when that happens! The day before we had a huge snowstorm. When the storm started, the snowflakes were the size of golf balls. My blue baseball cap quickly became white as those fat snowflakes fell on my head and melted on my face. It snowed all day and all night. The snow was almost ten inches deep that morning and my swing outside was a picture postcard. Those big snowflakes were a reminder of all the blessings Stone Coop Farm is going to receive and all the blessings we will provide in return. Those snowflakes helped me remember that our community wants to support us. We just need to ask for help. Together we will have a global impact on our food system and on our planet. The Stone Coop farm stand is open to the public every Wednesday from 4:00 PM to 6:00PM and Saturday from 9:00AM to Noon. Please visit their website at www.stonecoopfarm.com for their calendar of events, and to register for classes.

These noodles were about to be my dinner. My husband and I had decided to get take-out from Lan City, Ypsilanti's newest hand-pulled noodle restaurant, but no one answered the phone after three tries, so we decided to dine in instead. When we arrived, we saw why no one had an-swered the phone - Lan City was hopping! It was so crowded that people waited in chairs outside despite the chilly wind. After waiting a few minutes, we were given a number and then we waited out- side for about 20 more minutes. We were asked if we minded sharing a table, and we said no. The table was a large round-top, and two other couples were seated with us. We all chit-chatted a bit, one fellow patron telling us about his trip to the Great Wall of China and another a story from when he was young and his brother climbed onto one of the famous Qin Terracotta Army horses during a traveling exhibit. Both of the other groups had eaten at Lan City before and were enthu-siastic fans. I noticed that about half of the restaurant patrons were speaking Chinese, and I took this as further endorsement of Lan City's quality and authen-ticity. I was not disappointed. My beef noodle bowl had a rich broth, juicy slices of beef, scallions, and mild yet flavorful noodles. My husband's pad thai was both sweet and savory. I ordered a Thai milk tea, while he got the rose petal milk tea. Both were sweet, the latter also having a rich flavor. If you are a bubble tea fan, you will find that on the menu, as well. For appetizers, I highly recommend the satisfyingly crispy crab rangoons. The homemade scallion pancake was also delicious. Other items that enticed were various dumplings, egg rolls, spring rolls, beef and lamb sticks, samosas, and more. The noodle bowls came with pork, beef, chicken, duck, seafood, or tomato, both spicy and non, hot and cold. The menu also included more recognizable en-trees such as beef with broccoli, General Tso's chicken, curry chicken, and more. The two dessert options were mochi ice cream and lily flower soup with papaya snow fungus, which I fully intend to return and try one day when I am less full of delicious noodles. It was clear to all at the table that the family owned and operated Lan City could already stand to expand its location or perhaps add a second. Despite the packed dining room, our orders were promptly taken and the food arrived quickly. So don't let the line scare you! It's worth the wait. Lan City is located at 2612 Washtenaw Avenue in Ypsilanti, open Sunday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., Friday and Saturday from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. For more info, call 734-896-3888 or 734-896-3889, or visit lancitynoodles.com. Po\u00e7ai North Burns Park has a new, fun, and interesting place to grab a quick -and healthy\u2014bite to eat at Po\u00e7ai, located at the corner of Packard and Woodlawn. The name is a combination of poke (Hawaiian cubed fish; pronounced POH-keh) and a\u00e7a\u00ed (an oft-touted superfood berry; pronounced ah-sah-ee), both of which feature prominently on the menu in the form of poke bowls and a\u00e7a\u00ed bowls. A poke bowl is a native Hawaiian dish comprised of cubed fish, traditionally ahi, served over sushi rice (similar to Japanese chirashizushi). Po\u00e7ai's poke bowls are made up of one or two proteins (depending on if you choose medium or large size), citrus-based OG Ponzu sauce, pickled red onion, edamame, cucumber, The two dessert options were mochi ice cream and lily flower soup topped with papaya snow fungus, which I fully intend to return and try one day when I am less full of delicious noodles.The name is a combination of poke (Hawaiian cubed fish; POH-keh) and a\u00e7a\u00ed (an oft-touted superfood berry; pronounced ah-sah-ee), both of which feature prominently on the menu.

The protein options are tuna, salmon, and tofu. Add avocado for $1.50. Vegan? Ask for the vegan sriracha mayo. The a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl is like a dairy free yogurt parfait with a smoothie base comprised of a\u00e7a\u00ed berry, blueberries, strawberries, bananas, and almond milk and topped with granola, blueberries, banana, strawberries, chia seeds, peanut butter, and coconut flakes. For an extra 50 cents, you can add almond butter, deluxe granola, chocolate chips, or nutella. Gluten free granola is also available. The other menu items are two kinds of toast, avocado and tomato-hummus, and two kinds of salads, kale or chopped. The toasts can be made vegan and gluten free upon request, and the salads are both gluten free and can be made vegan. As for beverages, there are three types of La Croix, lime, pamplemousse, or passion fruit, and bottled water. The bowls are packed with nutrients and flavors that blend beautifully on the tongue. They are also filling! I was quite happy with my medium sized a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl and can of passion fruit La Croix. My dining companion was equally pleased with his medium poke bowl. Po\u00e7ai is small, and indoor seating is very limited. There are tables and chairs set up outside along the sidewalk, weather providing, and the friendly and accom-modating staff will bring your food out to you. The menu is designed for easy takeout, though, so it's convenient to drop in for a bowl-to-go, as well. Food is made fresh and to order and is delivered quickly. There is no parking lot, but we found plenty of free street parking, though you are limited to one hour. Po\u00e7ai is located at 1232 Packard Street in Ann Arbor and is open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. To call in your order, dial 734-780-7359. Afternoon Delight If you are visiting Ann Arbor and looking for a place to eat, one restaurant stands out in the guidebooks and online recommendations. Afternoon Delight, located at the corner of Liberty and Fifth in the heart of downtown is known for their break-fast and lunch hours and catering service. Afternoon Delight has offered an array of health y, fresh food options for 40 years. During the week, Afternoon Delight service is cafeteria style, and I have spoken to many people, since I moved to Ann Arbor eight years ago, who are fans of their sizeable salad bar. On the weekends, service switches to the more traditional sit-down table service, offering Afternoon Delight distinct twists on traditional breakfast staples such as the potato pancake eggs Benedict or pecan waffles with fruit and yogurt. (I also recommend the coffee, which isn't anything fancy, its just good coffee.) The restaurant is packed on weekends, especially if you inadvertently go on the morning of U-M's Homecoming football game, but it runs like a well-oiled ma-chine. The staff is friendly and really takes charge of the line that extends out the door , so you don't feel forgotten. A few of the people in line around me were sharing stories with their children about when they used to come in during their student days, clearly relishing the chance to share their favorite breakfast spot with their loved ones. Afternoon Delight is the one restaurant that stands out in the guidebooks and online recommendations. The hostess who took my name im- mediately referenced the character in the 1990's film \"Ferngully.\" She was the second or third person in my entire life to make that connection (it's even spelled the same, though I came before the movie), which honestly brightened my otherwise drizzly morning. I was lucky to speak with founder and owner, Tom Hackett, about what sets Afternoon Delight apart in Ann Arbor's ever changing foodscape and what keeps it going after all this time. \"Con - sistency,\" Hackett didn't hesitate to an-swer. \"I always make sure the products are the same... People wait in line for 45 minutes. You can't disappoint them!\" And Hackett was absolutely right when he told me that people come back for decades. A few of the people in line around me were sharing stories with their children about when they used to come in during their student days, clearly relishing the chance to share their favorite breakfast spot with their loved ones. Another contributor to Afternoon Delight's staying power is its ability to change. They discontinued dinner service some time ago, and now the restaurant closes at 3 p.m., leaving the afternoon and evening to devote to their catering service, which, Hackett shared, is about 35% of the business these days. Afternoon Delight caters quite a bit with the University of Michigan, the hospital, and the schools, but will work with anyone. While the catering menu (available on their website) includes many of After - noon Delight's customer favorites, it has a greatly expanded, unique menu for any occasion and any time of day. You will find, for example, boxed lunches, sandwich trays, party platters, and dessert trays. \"[It] keeps us busy!\" quipped Hackett. Hopefully, they will be keeping busy for a long time yet!Afternoon Delight is located at 251 East Liberty Street in Ann Arbor. Hours are Monday through Saturday 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. and Sunday 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. For more information, check out www.afternoondelightcafe.com or call 734-665-7513.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 52 Monica Gurnani, BHMS, CCH, RS (HOM) holds a Bachelors of Homeopathic Medicine from the prestigious University of Bombay Medical School and has had her own practice in Ann Arbor since 2012. She is passionate about leading a healthy, happy life close to Mother Nature and enjoys reading, yoga, and music in her spare time. As a homeopathic doctor, Monica is dedicated to improving the quality of your life naturally. Jennifer Carson: What brought you to Homeopathic Medicine?Monica Gurnani: My father used homeopathy. He was ill during my high school years as I was preparing to apply for medical school. He suffered from diabetes and that disease caused skin complications, but his life was saved due to homeopathy. His immune system improved, he avoided a hernia surgery, and his musculoskeletal system improved. In India, homeopathy is integrated into mainstream healthcare. Homeopathy schools have the same medical curriculum as a western style medical school, but the pharmacopeia part is based in natural pharmacy remedies. Because homeopathy played a significant part in my father's health, I decided my field of study would follow a more natural path. Jennifer Carson: What are the benefits of homeopathy? Are there any risks? Monica Gurnani: Most homeopathic remedies are safe, still it is better to consult a professional for higher potency remedies. When I teach homeopathy, I like to mention that none of the homeopathic medicines have ever been recalled. Dr. Hahnemann, a German physician and founder of homeopathy, wanted something safer and more gentle to treat the ailments of his children. That is why he developed homeopathy. It is very gentle for children, even infants, and toddlers. Most of the sources of the remedies are plants and minerals, remedies from Mother Nature. These remedies are different then herbs because they are diluted, and energy from the nano-particles in the remedies is what matters in the healing. It is always advisable to retain your primary physician for medical advice and lab work. I worked in a system where homeopathic and medical doctors worked together hand in hand, so the client is benefitted by all treatments available. It's about making sure we take care of the needs of our clients and knowing what the client is looking to achieve. Jennifer Carson: How do you determine which homeopathic medicine to treat your client with? Monica Gurnani: The principal of homeopathy is like cures like. In classical homeopathy we consider mental, emotional, and physical manifestations in an individual and try to match with the remedy. Homeopathic doctors call this a constitutional remedy\u2014it refers to the treatment of a client as a whole, taking into consideration both past and present symptoms. Treating clients as a whole interlinked system, instead of parts, helps them to attain homeostasis\u2014an environment of balance between interdependent systems. Homeopathy is more of a mind/body healing, instead of a treatment of just symptoms. Jennifer Carson: Is homeopathy safe for people who suffer from chronic illness? Monica Gurnani: It is fantastic for those who suffer from chronic illness. Dr. Hahnemann classified chronic illness into three different categories: Pseudo-chronic, Artificial chronic, and true natural chronic diseases. It is believed that causes of chronic illness are related to the predispositions we have through hereditary circumstances. So, we choose what is called the miasmatic remedy to get to the root cause of chronic illness. A miasm is the fundamental vulnerability in a living thing\u2014it is the force that leads our bodies toward disease instead of health, a certain predisposition for certain kinds of illness. It is a homeopathic doctor's job to discover theses miasms and create lasting improvements in a client's overall health. Jennifer Carson: What kind of issues are you seeing most in children today and what remedies do you prescribe? Monica Gurnani: I've been seeing various types of allergies, eczema, asthma, separation anxiety, ADHD, fears, and behavior issues, but kids respond beautifully to homeopathy. Recently I had a five-year-old with eczema and a fear of water. With classical homeopathy, and constitutional treatment, her fear of water was gone in four months. The eczema was gone too. The mother was a physician and so thankful because she thought that her daughter would never swim or go in the pool again. Our goal was to get rid of the eczema, banishing the fear was a bonus. Children don't have layers of conditioning like adults, so we see fantastic results very fast\u2014even with deep emotional issues like fear. I used to teach a mom's homeopathy class. I would always suggest that mothers carry a handful of remedies in their purse: Arnica for injuries, falls, and bruises.Chamomile is good to calm babies for long trips or on a plane, Hylands cold and cough remedies are good for the little ones too. I always give a flu kit to my clients to keep during the flu season, though it's also handy to have during weather changes too. This kit includes an immune booster (usually ferr.phos 6x or calc.phos 6x), gelsium 30, bell 30 for fever, nux.vomica 30 (for stomach ailment), sometimes Chestal cough syrup, and an Echinacea and elderberry supplement and lozenge. Do keep in mind that it is always best to choose an acute remedy (specifically for you) with the help of a professional, even with symptoms of flu and virus, as remedies will depend on symptom manifestation. Homeopathy treatments for ear infections are the best. I have had young clients scheduled for ear tubes, but they use homeopathy treatments and the ENT specialist tells them they don't need the tubes anymore. Jennifer Carson: What are some of your favorite remedies for the common cold and flu? Monica Gurnani: Bryonia for cough with throat symptoms. Aconite and Allium-cepa for cold with flu like symptoms. Allium cepa treats a runny watery nose, and Hylands cold is a good one to keep handy too. I always recommend lots of rest and water too! ### You can contact Monica Gurnani at 248-982-3642 or visit her office at the Parkway Center, 2345 S.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 53 Recently in the United States, the recycling movement is under attack. The federal government is dismantling one major environmental policy after another, and new quality-based restrictions by Chinese scrap buyers have sent the value of many recyclables into a free fall. This is hurting all recyclers, but especially those in Michigan, where landfill overcapacity had already put recycling at a disadvantage. Some communities are cutting back the materials they'll accept, some are stopping their recycling services altogether, and the rest are trying to figure out how to deal with the worst political and economic climate for recycling in generations. I've been working on these issues for three decades, and my organization, the Ecology Center, for far longer yet. We've got an answer for people and communities trying to make sense of the recycling chaos: The right response in 2018 is the same as it was in 2008, and in 1998, and in 1988. And it's what we've been urging communities to do since the 1970s. Double down on real recycling, and remember what it's truly supposed to be about.Real recycling is not about \"managing solid waste.\" It's about reducing the need for trash incinerators, like Detroit's, which is one of the community's worst sources of air pollution. It's about reducing the need for landfills, like Washtenaw County's one facility, which has been a source of noxious odors and state violations for two years. Real recycling is one of the most important ways that households and communities can reduce carbon emissions, air and water pollution, and natural resource depletion. In fact, doubling the U.S. recycling rate would reduce climate emissions as much as installing solar panels on 44 million homes. Real recycling is about the work of building a zero waste community. In a zero waste community, you don't just put your trash and recyclables in two separate bins - with one going to a landfill or incinerator, and the other to a loosely regulated overseas scrap market. A zero waste community uses less stuff in the first place; reuses and repurposes other things; works with manufacturers to redesign the \"throw away\" packaging; connects with other national, state, and regional organizations to lobby governments and industry to coordinate meaningful action; invests in ongoing education for residents and businesses; and makes sure that what's left gets collected and reprocessed in an authentic way\u2014into new recycled content products that can be recycled again and again or high quality compost that can grow healthy food. So, if you're a recycler today (a real recycler!) trying to make a difference in Ann Arbor, Dearborn, Detroit, or anywhere else in southeast Michigan, what do you need to do next?First of all, ignore the skeptics and naysayers. Landfill companies are telling communities to cut back their services, to quit collecting glass and other materials, to consider stopping services entirely. Their lobbyists are telling legislators that recycling isn't worth the trouble and expense. Their PR firms are publishing \"research\" that's meant to sow doubt in all our minds. Just remember, the landfill industry makes its profits from trash. Every bottle you recycle cuts into their bottom line a little bit. Recyclables are sold on global commodity markets; their prices constantly fluctuate, and they've been low before; they always recover. So ignore the naysayers, and instead, double down on recycling. For starters, Michigan should create a statewide fee on waste disposal to fund recycling programs. Michigan charges a nominal $0.36/ton fee right now, even though the average fee charged by our neighboring states is over $5/ton, with Wisconsin at $13. Senate Bill 943 would raise Michigan's rate to $4.44/ton, and that'd be a good start. The bill is sponsored by Sen. Mike Nofs, and supported by Governor Snyder. Second, support the shutdown of toxic disposal alternatives. At the top of that list is the Detroit trash incinerator mentioned above. Built in the 1980s, the facility has been a public health menace and financial albatross to the City for decades. It's one of the leading sources of asthma in a community with asthma rates five times higher than the rest of the state. Detroit should close its facility as soon as possible, and no later than 2020, when the City's current contract with the incinerator ends. Third, support public investments in recycling and zero waste in southeast Michigan. At the top of that list is a reinvestment in Ann Arbor's materials recovery facility (MRF). The MRF is the place where household and commercial recyclables gets sorted and shipped to re-processors. Ann Arbor's facility was closed down in 2016, increasing the City's expenses by $1 million per year. Even worse, it shrunk the processing capacity for recyclables in the larger region, so, even if you don't live in Ann Arbor, your recycling options have shrunk too. Ann Arbor should reinvest in its facility, even if it doesn't rebuild a full-scale MRF. Finally, be mindful about stuff. Not just about any old stuff - I'm talking about the consumer objects and containers of everyday life. Avoid excessive packaging. Avoid unnecessary packaging. Avoid unrecyclable or uncompostable packaging. Reuse and repair what you can. Recycle mindfully, and learn the recycling requirements in your community. The U.S. recyclables market is glutted today because Chinese scrap merchants (who'd become the leading buyers of American recyclables) wouldn't tolerate scrap loads with large amounts of trash. When recyclables aren't prepared and processed cleanly, they have less value, and Chinese markets said they wouldn't take it our way anymore. The bottom line to all of us is that we're not throwing away garbage. We're providing raw materials for new products. Over the years, many communities grew complacent about recycling, and thought \"that problem's been solved, what's next?\" Like all good things, though, recycling and zero waste needs steady attention. Don't give up when you read bad news about recycling - now is the time to do real recycling, and start building zero waste communities. ab Michael Garfield is the long time director of the Ecology Center, which aids in the development of innovative solutions for healthy people and a healthy planet.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 54 By Emily Slomovits Since its inception in 1980, The Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor has flown mostly under the radar, but its popularity has also been steadily growing over the years. Named after German philosopher Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925), the school uses his philosophy of child development and ideas about well-rounded human beings to provide students with a holistic and age-specific education. One of over 1,000 Steiner-influenced \"Waldorf schools\" in 60 countries (there are 150 in North America), the schools are renowned for their emphasis on music and the arts, their original approach to the teaching of the sciences, and their celebration of nature, childhood play, and seasonal rituals. \"Waldorf education sees much more than just the intellect as the focus of attention,\" says Si\u00e2n Owen-Cruise, currently the School Coordinator of Rudolf Steiner, and previously the High School Coordinator (since 2010). \"There's a deep understanding of the developmental differences at different ages, and the way in which we teach is really tailored to those developmental stages.\" In some respects, it could be argued that this need to tailor education to the age of the child is most important when working with very young children. But at the high school, the faculty feels this form of education is equally vital for teens. \"Waldorf\" refers to the Waldorf-Astoria Cigarette factory in Stuttgart, Germany, where Steiner, at the behest of Emil Molt, the factory's director, started a school for the children of the workers in the factory. His radical conditions for starting the school \u2014 that it be coed, that teachers have freedom and control of the school, and that it be open to all children \u2014 were the foundation for what became the Steiner teaching philosophy. By 1928 it had migrated across the ocean to North America. \"Everything is based on experiencing the phenomena,\" says English teacher Mary Emery, one of the high school's founding teachers, who is on partial retirement this year. \"The students are placed in the middle of something that's living. It's not about memorizing facts or someone else's ideas; it's about actually experiencing for yourself, becoming a really keen observer, and coming to your own ideas about what you're witnessing.\" Gary Banks, in his 12th year as the Life Sciences teacher, agrees that the ability to think critically and form opinions for oneself comes from experiencing the world. \"Essentially, we're always trying to begin with experiences that everyone in the room can have \u2014 taking a class into the woods so we could observe a salamander, having everyone do or watch a chemistry experiment. But then there's this process that you Lifting the Spirit and Educating Well-Rounded Students \u2014 The Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor Comes of Age, and Expands Anyone who steps in to either the Lower School or the High School is readily dazzled and stirred by the quality of the students' art work on the walls, and by the quieting but lively feel. There is a creative rustle to the place that lifts one's spirit even as it calms the nerves. In today's overly wired world, that makes it a very special environment for the education of the next generation. A peek into an Elementary classroom.Waldorf education sees much more than just the intellect as the focus of attention.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 55 write up your observations of an experiment, and then you talk as a class about what you experienced. Everyone has a different point of view, and so you start to say, 'Oh, someone might have seen something different,' and you start to work together to create a whole picture. In this curriculum, we're really trying to foster the students' development of this capacity of thinking through actual experiences, and then applying their thinking to understand them. To support your own thoughts, I think you need experiences as well.\" Steiner emphasized beauty in his philosophy, seeing beauty in nature, in life, in people, and trying one's best to make beauty through one's actions. The Waldorf educational system, started by Steiner in 1919, carries that viewpoint on. \"I was always interested in beauty, but not just for its own sake; what can it bring to a person's life, how can it change them, how can it help all people in all fields of study or work\", says Margot Amrine, the high school history teacher for 11 years. She also spent almost 20 years before that as a class teacher \u2014 taking the same class of students from first through eighth grade. \"I hadn't found that anywhere else in an education system. It was Waldorf education that seemed to imagine the arts as transformative, and a necessary part of childhood.\" When the first Waldorf School of Ann Arbor was established, it was housed in a building near Cobblestone Farm, on Packard Road. In 1986, the Newport Road location, which currently houses the school's pre-K through 8 th grade campus, was purchased and the school began to grow and flourish. Mary Emery and her husband, Geoff Robb, had moved from Seattle to Ann Arbor in 1996, shortly before they were asked to be two of the founding teachers at what was to be the new Waldorf High School. Robb, now retired, taught math and physics at the high school; a couple of things he finds compelling about Waldorf education is the attention to the students and being able to support them in an individualized way. \"We try to inspire them to be interested and engaged, and that's the bottom line. There can be different intellectual capacities, and it doesn't really matter, because if everyone is working to their own individual capacity, that's perfect.\" Even though students are able to work to their own capacity, a unique aspect of the education is its unified approach to all the subjects. Every student takes math, science, and a language, but every student also sings in the all-school choir and takes all of the art classes. \"It's so well-balanced; all the art and music balance out the academic work, and I think it makes for more well-rounded and more tolerant individuals,\" says Robb. Robb and Emery are only two of the many teachers who've helped build the school into the thriving, growing entity that it is today. Their work has created more than thoughtful global citizens: it's prompted one of their former students to take a position at the school. Noah Burns, a member of the 2013 high school graduating class, began teaching some of Emery's English classes in September. \"Mary Emery really inspired me, both in how I approach literature and philosophy, and in how I approach my life,\" he says. \"The impetus toward character, by which I mean the desire and ability to practice radical self-honesty, struck me in her classes. It seemed to me that she was striving to embody the Waldorf philosophy, and that interested me in the philosophy. I guess she made a mistake, because now I've come back to steal her job.\" Burns is trying to live up to the example set by Emery and the other teachers who inspired him during his 14 years at Steiner, counting the two years of kindergarten that most Steiner students go through. \"Steiner requires a lot of its teachers,\" he says. \"As a Waldorf teacher, you're expected to develop yourself into a practitioner of a high art, one with extremely high aesthetic, intellectual, and moral demands. You don't see the inner work as a student. You see the high points of the process, which I just described. But you don't really see the self-doubt, the long nights, the frustration, or the endless self-discipline required to review dozens of assignments and truly give all of them your full attention and care.\" High School juniors re-create Impressionist paintings.

With an ever-growing high school population to provide for, renovations for a new gym, more classroom space, and science labs were completed in time for the fall 2018 semester to begin. \"Enrollment has grown quite dramatically,\" says Owen-Cruise. \"With enrollment comes a vibrancy and a health in the high school that just brings a depth of interest, connections, and social life that's really healthy for teens. But it became clear that we needed, as a school, three different things. The first was more classroom space to accommodate the programs we already had; we had a number of classes that were taking space in places that were not classrooms, and we didn't have a dedicated Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor Continued from page 55 Outdoor experiences are an integral part of Waldorf education.Even though students are able to work to their own capacity, a unique aspect of the education is its unified approach to all the subjects. High School students participate in a range of musical opportunities such as small ensembles, jazz band, steel drums, chorus, and orchestra. Sharing healthy snacks are a part of the daily rhythm of the early childhood classroom.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 57 space for languages, for example. Also, as the size of the high school grew, so did the importance of sports. I think it's one of the reasons actually that the size grew, because we were able to provide stronger sports programs, and that helped students who wanted that to stay in the school. But it also meant that we were having to rent gym space all over town. So, we also needed gym and athletic space to meet the needs of our students, and until the start of this school year, we had nowhere where the entire community, lower school and high school, could meet inside. The new space, which we've now fully moved into, has given us new classroom space, an additional science lab, additional art space, and two language rooms. All of this allows us to meet [the needs of] the students we're working with more successfully.\" Another way faculty and staff work to meet students' needs is through a \"college of teachers,\" which is responsible for all the pedagogy and teaching-related issues, such as determining if a new teacher is right for the school, teacher evaluations, and specifics of the curriculum. A board of trustees is legally and financially responsible for the school, but the college of teachers has control over the pedagogical governance of the school. The school being largely faculty-run was one of Steiner's conditions for his educational model, and the Ann Arbor Steiner School holds true to this. \"We like to make decisions out of consensus, and it's pretty unusual these days to have a group that does that, but we really do,\" says Banks. Despite higher enrollment, the condition that the school be open to all students is a difficult one to fulfill. The school takes no government assistance; it relies on donations, tuition, and fundraising, which means that the cost of attendance is too high for many families. \"By far the most important issue in Waldorf education today is accessibility,\" says Burns. \"Most private Waldorf schools in America are not accessible to the poor, or in many cases even the middle class.\" Other faculty members are similarly frustrated about the high costs. \"I do wish that funding came somehow not just on the backs of the parents, because I wish every child and every family who wanted to be here could be here,\" says Owen-Cruise. But teachers also shared hopes for the future. \"I hope that the richness that's offered in the classroom can continue, and I hope that there are teachers who are interested in working with Rudolf Steiner's picture of human development,\" says Emery. Robb agrees. \"Rudolf Steiner's philosophy, which is kind of what underlays this education, takes time to investigate, and it takes time to build a relationship with it. I think it's what makes the education so great and so powerful, and I hope that the teachers in the future have the time and the interest to really dive into it. I still think the essence of Waldorf education is living very strongly in this high school and this community, and it's not under threat at all. It will carry on into the future, and most likely will thrive here.\" Amrine is optimistic about the future of Waldorf education, believing that it's necessary for the development of well-rounded human beings, and for the future of our world. \"This is an education that's really about integrating different skills; and I think that practicing that over many years changes the way people approach their jobs and their relationships. I think high school students are looking for meaning, not just a test score. They're looking for these four years to be deeply enriching and meaningful. This education has tremendous potential in terms of changing people's lives, in terms of confidence, in terms of thinking very broadly, and in a very interconnected way. As we move into the next century of Waldorf education, I think the world is crying out for people who see how systems relate to each other, people who understand ecology. But I also mean ecology in many spheres; when we make decisions, they have effects. Waldorf students have been trained to see connections, and have been trained to see how interactions between human beings can profoundly affect policy, can profoundly affect cultural and scientific directions. We need that.\" Waldorf education, in its own special way, has certainly thrived here in Ann Arbor. The school's teachers, administrators, staff, students, alumni, parents, and former parents, as well as community members who just believe in Steiner's teachings and the Waldorf education model, have kept the school relevant and dynamic for the last decades. Anyone who steps in to either the Lower School or the High School is readily dazzled and stirred by the quality of the students' art work on the walls, and by the quieting but lively feel. There is a creative rustle to the place that lifts one's spirit even as it calms the nerves. In today's overly wired world, that makes it a very special environment for the education of the next generation. Emily Slomovits is a graduate of the Rudolph Steiner School and EMU.

And we as the practitioners are the recipients of this gift of an insight into all of the processes and all of the forces in nature and in the human being that create illness, and how to bring them together so that the person can actually be healed of the problem, rather than addressing just the symptom.\" \u2014 Dr. Molly McMullen-Laird Interviewed by Emily Slomovits Photography by Hilary Nichols Quentin McMullen and Molly McMullen-Laird are a husband-and-wife doctor team and the founders of Rudolf Steiner Health Center, which is one of Ann Arbor's leading alternative medical practices. Now celebrating its 20 th anniversary, Steiner Health is unique as a \"community-supported medical practice,\" and it focuses on anthroposophic medicine, which combines conventional and integrative approaches to medicine and is based on the teachings of Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner. The environment where I met them is distinctly unlike a traditional doctor's office. The rooms are artistically painted in cheery colors and filled with art and plants. Nothing is too bright or flashy; instead, a peaceful atmosphere greets patients as they step through the doors. The feeling is reinforced by Quentin and Molly; tall, mellow Quentin perfectly complements smaller, more animated Molly. Intelligence and warmth radiate from both of them, and each has her/his own way of putting patients at ease; Molly's eyes sparkle with tenderness and enthusiasm, while Quentin's radio-worthy voice is firm and calming. I spoke with Quentin and Molly about anthroposophic medicine, the history of their practice, and their dynamic as a married team of doctors. Emily Slomovits: Where did each of you grow up, and how did you meet?Molly McMullen-Laird: I was born in New Jersey, and Quentin was born in Connecticut, both of us in the country. Quentin McMullen: We both went to the University of Connecticut, which is actually how we met. We both worked in Boston in research for a year, and then both went to medical school in New Orleans. Molly McMullen-Laird: We did our residencies together in internal medicine at Reading Hospital, Pennsylvania, where there was also a Waldorf School. At that point, Sara, our oldest daughter, was getting ready to go to kindergarten. We also knew two other anthroposophic doctors in the area, so we were planning to settle there and work with them once we finished our residencies. Sara and our second child, Christopher, started school there. After we finished our residency, because Quentin had a military scholarship for medical school, he was obligated to serve four years in the Air Force. We went to Germany for that, and again, our children were able to attend a Waldorf School -- they are very easy to find over there. We then finished our training by working in anthroposophic hospitals in Germany and Switzerland for three years before we came here. \"...During my college years, I went to work in Germany and Holland in anthroposophic communities, first in a big gardening community, and later in a Camphill community, which is an intentional community for children with special needs, both physical and mental. One of my jobs there was to give them their medicines. They didn't look like any other medicine that I was used to, so I became curious.\" \u2014 Dr. Quentin McMullenThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 59 Emily Slomovits: Were any of your parents doctors? How did you become interested in medicine? Quentin McMullen: My parents were not, although I think my father would have made a good physician because of his inquisitive mind. He worked in electronics and was a writer later in life. My mother was a librarian; she didn't work outside the house until we were out of the house. Molly's father was an industrial engineer, and her mother was a hospital laboratory technician. Emily Slomovits: Were you ever interested in pursuing another profession before medicine? Quentin McMullen: After high school I was pretty sure I would go into the political world, statesmanship, or something to do with government. I was very interested in all of that. But it was a very unfortunate time for young people, rather like now, where many young people shy away from it. Those were the Nixon years; the United States invaded Cambodia, the Kent State tragedy happened, in general bad things were happening in the world. I said to myself, 'Maybe there's something else!'. I didn't really know exactly what that something else would be until I went to Germany as a 20-year-old, and then things settled themselves. Molly McMullen-Laird: For a while, I thought I would become a researcher; in college I very much enjoyed doing biochemical research. I thought biochemistry was the answer to all the things we needed to understand in biology. Emily: How did you discover anthroposophic medicine?Quentin: I learned about it first because, during my college years, I went to work in Germany and Holland in anthroposophic communities, first in a big gardening community, and later in a Camphill community, which is an intentional community for children with special needs, both physical and mental. One of my jobs there was to give them their medicines. They didn't look like any other medicine that I was used to, so I became curious. I might have had some interest before that, but suddenly I became interested in studying medicine, and practicing anthroposophic medicine afterwards. I returned to the U.S. and finished my undergraduate degree. Molly and I met and began talking about attending medical school. During that time I introduced Molly to what I knew about anthroposophic medicine.Emily: What did you study in undergrad? Was it just what you would need for pre-med, or did you have another major? Molly: Biology, basic pre-med. Quentin: What I recommend to pre-med students these days, is to major in something else that you are passionate about. Take the required biology and chemistry classes, but wait until medical school for the rest of the science you need. Molly: Right, these days you can, but it was a little more straight-laced and narrow path when we went to medical school. But I think the interesting thing for our story is that when Quentin went to Dornach, Switzerland for a youth conference in 1972, and met a lot of young people who were involved in a lot of anthroposophical things, that was a big introduction for him, and he made connections. That's how he ended up going back to Germany to work in a biodynamic garden as a gardener -- in a large, intentional, anthroposophic community called Schloss Hamborn. They have a nursing home there, and they have a kindergarten that's attached to the nursing home, so when the kids go out and play, the older people can sit and watch them. They had the Waldorf School, a nursery, a farm, a sanatorium, which you think of now in America as like a mental hospital, but this was more like a rehabilitation hospital, with maybe 50 beds. There was the beekeeper and the dairy farmer, and the garden for the vegetables, and the baker, and some people worked outside in other jobs, but most people worked inside the community. For Quentin to go and experience that in Europe, he just happened to land in a community that was really ideal, really functioned in an inter-connected way, with medicine, education, and agriculture. And those three things are really the pillars of anthroposophy in the world; the number one pillar is Waldorf education, the second pillar is biodynamic agriculture, and the third is medicine. Emily: For someone who doesn't know, can you explain how the practice of anthroposophic medicine differs from more conventional medicine? Quentin: Anthroposophy came from Rudolf Steiner in the 20 th Century. He was a lecturer, an educator, highly intelligent and interested in what humanity needed to progress, and so he would lecture about those kinds of things, from a theosophical origin. Eventually he realized that he had to write about it in his own way, and so he wrote maybe 60 books in his lifetime, and people would come to him and ask him about different aspects. For example, the Waldorf schools came from the Waldorf cigarette factory in Stuttgart, Germany; the owner of the factory asked him, \"Can you make a school for the children whose parents work in the factory, so that they will have a reasonable education?\" So Steiner gave a series of courses to a group of teachers to prepare the curriculum for the Waldorf School movement. The same thing happened with medicine. A group of doctors came to him and said, \"We're not satisfied with what we're doing here; can you give us some insight?\" Another thing that is quite different from conventional medicine is the pharmacy - how to take a substance from a plant, or an animal or mineral, and make it available as a pharmaceutical product for human beings. Not just the extract; that ends up being a chemical extract, but something of the whole plant exists in the anthroposophic medicines. And then, when it's taken in, either internally, or externally as a bath or ointment, it meets the illness in the human being, and sets something off in the direction of healing. There is, for Steiner, a very strong connection between what the pathology is, what the problem is, and what you can find in nature that is related to that pathology. We always start with what's wrong with the patient, and then we find what there is in nature that is similar to this, and can help turn it around. \"They had the Waldorf School, a nursery, a farm... a rehabilitation hospital, with maybe 50 beds... There was the beekeeper and the dairy farmer, and the garden for the vegetables, and the baker, and some people worked outside in other jobs, but most people worked inside the community.\" \u2014 Dr. Molly McMullen-Laird The movement therapy sessions work one on one with patients attending the Life Force Intensive Retreat. Movement therapy includes sequences to learn and practice which go back to Greek times. \"And those three things are really the pillars of anthroposophy in the world; the number one pillar is Waldorf education, the second pillar is biodynamic agriculture, and the third is medicine.\" \u2014 Dr. Molly McMullen-Laird Continued on page 60The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 60 Molly: For me, the essential aspect of what makes anthroposophic medicine different, or any of what Rudolf Steiner brought into the world, is that he gained insight on his own through a meditative path, to understand the world as it is, all aspects of the world. He wanted to explain the path that each person can follow and apply to his or her own profession. And he always said to make your own experience. Figure it out for yourself. He based a lot of this on the work that Goethe had done before him in the phenomenology of nature, and physics, and all of the things that Goethe had worked on besides his literary accomplishments. When y ou look at the remedies, and how he picked a certain collection of plants, maybe with a metal or a mineral that has been processed in a certain way, and the fact that he understands that as the treatment for a particular condition - which he explains in a different way than conventional medicine would, it's on a very different level. And we as the practitioners are the recipients of this gift of an insight into all of the processes and all of the forces in nature and in the human being that create illness, and how to bring them together so that the person can actually be healed of the problem, rather than addressing just the symptom. Emily: Sometimes, conventional care is required for a patient. When do you know to integrate that care, or recommend that to someone, and how do you balance the two kinds of care? Molly: Well, there are acute situations that really require immediate surgery, or hospitalization, or there are some infections that are really dangerous, where antibiotics are life-saving, or surgery is life-saving. If there's chest pain, you go right to the emergency room. And our conventional medicine and technological advances are very good at that acute and interventional type of medicine for emergencies. Emily: Obviously, there are married couples that each do similar kinds of work, but don't work together. How did you decide to open a practice together, and what does your dynamic as a couple provide for each of you, and for your patients? In what ways do you balance/complement each other? Quentin: We have different strengths in medicine; Molly is much more involved in dietary counseling and women's medicine, kids, and I do more with toxins and Lyme disease. The best part is that we can say, \"Here, I've got this patient, this is the situation. What do you think?\" I can ask Molly like no other physician I could ask. Molly: That's the real upside of the whole thing; we have kind of the same background in conventional medicine, we were both trained in general internal medicine, and we've been through similar trainings for anthroposophic medicine in the hospitals in Europe. We can really consult with each other, and since it's kind of a niche that we're in, it's good that we're not alone. Emily: You have your regular practice, but you also have health retreats and other programs. Molly: For the retreats, people come from all over the States, with all kinds of illnesses. Probably half of them are cancer patients, but we have people recovering from stroke, or chronic heart disease, or Lyme disease. We recruit therapists mostly from the Ann Arbor area; we have movement therapy, massage therapy, bath therapy, art therapy, and they all have an anthroposophical basis because that's our work at the health center, to have a home for all the therapies. We also ha ve fasting weekends where a dozen people come for the weekend program. Emily: How did you come to Ann Arbor?Quentin: I had met Dr. Ernst Katz when I was 19. When I lived near New York, I would go in and listen to the anthroposophists give lectures in Manhattan at the Anthroposophical Society, and all I knew about Dr. Katz was that he was a good lecturer. I still had my notes from his lectures years later when we were looking for where in the United States to go after we came back from our training in Europe. So, we took this big tour around the States, and stopped where we knew people; we had the idea for the health center, and we wanted there to be at least one other anthroposophic physician available to help us with that. There had to be a Waldorf High School. Those were our two requirements. Emily: Yes, congratulations! Steiner Health has now been up and running for twenty years. What has changed in your practice over the years, and what do you see in its future? Molly: We were very blessed in the first year we were here, with the inauguration of the Patient Organization. That was part of the idea we came with; it's a collective of patients who pay a certain amount every month, and then when they come, they don't pay for that service. We have educational events, volunteer commitments, the members get involved in the overall mission. We were very lucky in the beginning that there was a significant group of people who stood behind that and made it happen. And I believe that's what has sustained us. This group of dedicated and forward-thinking people, who really see that medicine should belong to the community, and be available when they need it. So w e've been really blessed that we've had that kind of privilege as physicians, to do anthroposophic medicine without compromise in that group of patients. It's a community function, and many people have put in a lot of hours to make that happen. Quentin: In the future, I'm hoping that there is a group of alternative physicians and patients who create a parallel system. Molly: It needs to be said that our organization is a 501(c)[3] non-profit entity; Community Supported Anthroposophical Medicine, modeled after the CSA movement for farmers and their members. Our organization is run according to Rudolf Steiner's Social Impulse of Threefolding which means that there are three spheres in society that should be understood as interacting with each other, but none should determine the function of the others. Those spheres are the Economic Sphere representing Fraternity, the Rights Sphere representing Equality, and the Cultural Sphere representing Freedom. Medicine is in the Cultural Sphere, which means it should be free from undue economic or legislative burdens so that each patient has access to the kind of health choices they see as appropriate for them, and the societal system should support healthcare by way of the profits generated in the economic sphere.The Crazy Wisdom Interview with Dr. Molly McMullen-Laird and Dr. Quentin McMullen Continued from page 59 Plant-based, organic, and freshly prepared meals are a highlight for all who attend an intensive health session. \"Rudolf Steiner based a lot of this on the work that Goethe had done before him in the phenomenology of nature, and physics, and all of the things that Goethe had worked on besides his literary accomplishments.\" \u2014 Dr. Molly McMullen-Laird Please see photos on opposite page, and text continued on page 62The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 61 \"Another thing that is quite different from conventional medicine is the pharmacy - how to take a substance from a plant, or an animal or mineral, and make it available as a pharmaceutical product for human beings.

Moving back to the medicine, itself, do you prescribe tinctures and remedies that are considered anthroposophic medicines? Are they different and distinct from homeopathic remedies, and if so, are they flower essences, or remedies of a different sort? Please describe them a bit. Molly: The remedies that we use are from anthroposophic pharmacies which include a large body of homeopathic and herbal medicines, many of which are prepared and used in a way that differs from classical homeopathy. Some of the remedies are combinations of various plants that together create a remedy for a particular condition. The pharmacists utilize many interesting processes to transform the substances of nature into a form that functions as a remedy. They use heating and cooling, fermentation, exposure to light and darkness, harvesting and processing according to certain annual rhythms and very precise dissection of parts of plants, minerals and animals to combine in the remedies. Emily: Can you give our readers a sense of how you might treat a few common ailments, such as high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes, hypothyroid, and osteopenia or osteoporosis -- to give our readers a sense of how the anthroposophic approach may be different? Molly: Our approach to deficiency illnesses like diabetes, hypothyroidism, adrenal fatigue or osteoporosis is to support the normal function of the organ or combination of organs involved, so that the process is able to work normally again on its own. We use remedies called organ preparations which are typically potentized homeopathic remedies. This encourages the function when the process is weakened, rather than substituting for the missing hormone or other substance as is often done in allopathic and herbal treatments. Although desiccated animal thyroid or adrenal gland may be more biologically congruent than synthetic preparations, the effect on the system is very similar in that it further substitutes for the normal function of that organ. We know that taking too many steroids can The Crazy Wisdom Interview with Dr. Molly McMullen-Laird and Dr. Quentin McMullen Continued from page 61result in adrenal failure, but many patients take desiccated adrenal gland for fatigue which most likely will prolong the deficiency. Such preparations are readily available over the counter and it is necessary to read the label very carefully to find out if the desiccated organ preparations are in the supplements. We also find it necessary to work on lifestyle and diet changes that may contribute to the patient's condition. At times we may need to use allopathic or herbal substances temporarily. Most herbal preparations have strong effects on the patients, not unlike allopathic medicines. In the best-case scenario, we are able to regain the function of the involved system using homeopathic approaches. For other conditions, such as essential hypertension, we may need to work in an indirect approach to offset the influences allowing the condition to arise, rather than directly. We work as closely as possible with our medical colleagues to address transitions away from (safely and step-by-step) the allopathic medicines which some of our patients take. Emily: How have you gone about looking for other doctors who could join with your practice? And since it's been unsuccessful so far, have you considered other ways to go about this, to make this a reality in the future? Molly: We are looking for a physician who is finished with the corporate medical model and is determined to find a way to care for patients outside of the economic model that is prevalent. In other words, someone so dissatisfied that they would be happy to abandon a typical physician salary for quality of life in their day to day work life. Of course, it also has to be someone who is keenly interested in anthroposophical medicine, a fully trained MD or DO, and willing to spend some time studying the basics. It is a lifelong study for everyone, in any case, so we are looking for that commitment. Our organization is community owned and governed which is also a major departure from traditional medical practices, hospital owned or private ventures. So we put out the word in the national anthroposophical medical circles as well as letting our medical student and resident physician connections know what we have to offer. Emily: How many children do you have, what are their names and ages, and what are they up to these days? Molly: We have four grown children all of whom were educated in Waldorf Schools in Europe and the United States. Our oldest, Sara Purple, is trained to teach Waldorf high school Physics and Art. Our second, Christopher, is currently studying conducting at the Royal College of Music in London. Our daughter, Lydia, is studying Journalism at Columbia University in New York and our youngest, Samuel, just graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in Philosophy. Our children lived in Germany and Switzerland while we were doing training and have had many international experiences. They speak quite a few different languages, in addition to German, which they spoke while in elementary school in Europe. Emily: What do you most enjoy about Ann Arbor in the spring and summer? Molly: I like to walk, and we live in town so are able to easily walk downtown to an event or to just walk around campus. I very much enjoy the young people and the neighborhood feeling of Ann Arbor. We are so blessed here with small local businesses full of personality and creativity like Crazy Wisdom! Quentin: One of the reasons we chose to come to Ann Arbor was because of the university. U-M has a not-so-subtle effect on conversations one has around town, as well as tolerance for progressive social ideas which I appreciate. Not to forget is the great education three of our children received at the University of Michigan. ###\"We have kind of the same background in conventional medicine, we were both trained in general internal medicine, and we've been through similar trainings for anthroposophic medicine in the hospitals in Europe. We can really consult with each other, and since it's kind of a niche that we're in, it's good that we're not alone.\" \u2014 Dr. Molly McMullen-Laird \"We were very blessed in the first year we were here, with the inauguration of the Patient Organization. That was part of the idea we came with; it's a collective of patients who pay a certain amount every month, and then when they come, they don't pay for that service. We have educational events, volunteer commitments, the members get involved in the overall mission.\" \u2014 Dr. Molly McMullen-Laird \"For the retreats, people come from all over the States, with all kinds of illnesses. Probably half of them are cancer patients, but we have people recovering from stroke, or chronic heart disease, or Lyme disease...\" \u2014 Dr. Molly McMullen-Laird An art therapist gives adjustments to the process during a watercolor exercise.A peek into the Art Room at the Rudolf Steiner Health Center.By San Slomovits Phot os by Joni Strickfaden When I emailed Anne Ormond to ask if I could interview her for this profile in the Crazy Wisdom Journal she replied, \"Sure, why not? For Crazy Wisdom? That is a pretty good description of me\u2014crazy wisdom.\" The answer is typical Anne; brief, perceptive, a little self-deprecating, and witty. In a later conversation I said to her, \" A lot of people your age are doing a fraction of what you're doing,\" she shot back with, \"A lot of people my age are dead.\" Anne is 83, and still busily engaged in a dizzying array of organizations and activities. \" Well, I got to be 83, and I am still healthy\u2014through pure luck and heredity, and maybe also thanks to my healthy life-style. I am constantly doing things; physical, mental, social, and spiritual. Many things that I do fit into more than one category. I choose to do things that I love. I have passions.\" And she seems compelled to seize every opportunity to wring as much as possible out of every single moment. Nevertheless, amidst all this plethora of interests two dominant themes emerge; music and moving. Anne plays clarinet and piano in a nU-Mber of local ensembles. She still plays an average of forty concerts a year with, among others, the Ann Arbor Concert Band, the Ann Arbor SU-Mmer Civic Band, the Dexter Community Band, the Ypsilanti Symphony Orchestra, Pittsfield Open Band (Contra Dance Band), Clarinet ContinuU-M, and various chamber music groups. \"All amateur, just for fun.\" She is also a proud member of the Ann Arbor AlU-Mni Chapter of Mu Phi Epsilon International Professional Music Fraternity. The Fraternity is committed to the advancement of beautiful music in local communities and around the world - fostering \"Service to Others Through Music\"\u2014 as well as the promotion of musicianship and scholarship among its members. Music has been a lifelong abiding passion for Anne. A short upright piano and a small baby grand occupy pride of place in her living room. When I remark on them she says nonchalantly, \"Well, I play with a partner.\" She continues, \"I begged for a piano from the time I first touched one when I was five. I put a finger on a key, it made a sound and I thought that was the most marvelous thing that had happened to me in my life.\" Her parents were not musical. \"They liked Lawrence Welk. They hoped I would forget about this, but I kept asking, and when I was seven, all of my schoolmates in our neighborhood had to take piano lessons on the piano in their dining room, which they all had. And I could The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 63 not. I asked my parents, they said, 'Well, you'll learn better, faster if you wait till you're older. Besides, you should be able to reach an octave before you try to play the piano.' I don't know how my parents knew the word octave. (Laughter) Anyway, I kept trying, and when I was ten I came home before Christmas and said, 'Mom, I did it. I reached an octave!' My parents bought that piano in 1942, (she points to the Howard upright), gave me lessons with a woman down the street, and I was very happy. The Kimball baby grand, I bought at King's Keyboard in 1990.\" Born Anne Dowling in Chicago in 1935, her family moved to Willamette, Illinois when Anne was about to enter high school. In her sophomore year she decided to join the marching band as a way to make friends in her new surroundings. She laughs as she describes how she wound up playing clarinet. \"My father said, 'No brass\u2014it's not ladylike.' My mother hoped not the violin, she couldn't stand how screechy they were. Little did she know what the clarinet could do. The band director said, 'No brass? Well, we have too many flutes already, and surprisingly, we have enough oboes, and besides you wouldn't want to play that because oboists go crazy.' (Imagine hearing this from a band director!) 'How about the clarinet?' he asked. I said, 'Great.' I had no idea what one was.\" But, because of her years of musical training on the piano, she took to the clarinet quickly and after high school entered Michigan State University as a music major on clarinet. She transferred to the University of Michigan a third of the way through her college sophomore year because, \"I'd been to Interlochen and worked with Maynard Klein, who was choral director at U-M, and I wanted to include vocal music in my education.\" She graduated from U-M in 1957 with a bachelor's degree in music education. She also met her first husband there, renowned clarinetist, Fred Ormand, who was completing his bachelor's at U-M. Anne taught vocal music at an elementary school in Wayne and then near Lansing while Fred completed his Master's degree at Michigan State. A few years later, in 1962, after living and teaching in Texas, the young couple moved back to Michigan, and Fred became a member of the faculty of the debut year of the Interlochen Arts Academy. Now the Interlochen Center for the Arts, is an arts boarding school for students in grades 3-12, as well as offering a yearly SU-Mmer Arts Camp, concerts, classes and many other arts events. Their first child, Keith, had been born in Texas, and, \"We happened to have the first Academy faculty baby, our second child, Kirk, that November. We were up there with other young people, all in about the same stage of life, early 20s, early 30s, Anne Ormond: A Vessel of Crazy Wisdom Music, Moving, and Life Lessons from an Octogenarian The answer is typical Anne; brief, perceptive, a little self-deprecating, and witty.\".... I choose to do things that I love. I have passions.\" Continued on page 64having kids, families growing up. For the next few years, among the faculty, all living on the campus at Interlochen, there were twenty-two pre-school children, all wandering around free. There were no fences around houses, we all knew everybody there was safe. When I lived there, nobody ever locked their doors. I never locked my bike, even in the sU-Mmers when the campers were there. This was a different era, this was a different community. Everybody knew everybody. When the kids went trick or treating they didn't have to have an adult with them. Our back door opened out into the woods. We cross-country skied in there, we walked in there, we biked in there, we did everything in those woods. They wandered without supervision. They knew where they were going, they knew how to get back. If a kid said they were going out into the woods\u2014if they thought to even tell us\u2014they'd be OK. (Laughter) They wouldn't get lost. They all survived. One time when my kids were four and five, it was winter and there was snow, and they came back (after being outside for awhile). \"Guess what, Mom! We stamped out a big SOS in one of the fields in the woods, and we were waiting to be rescued, but they haven't come yet. (Laughter) We had to go to Traverse City for the hospital (to give birth). My daughter, Carol, was actually born in fifty minutes between two concerts that my husband was involved in. (Laughter) We left one, he drove me to the hospital, she was born, he left me, drove back, and watched his kids do the other one. It was fun.\" After ten years Fred was going to take a leave from Interlochen, and they were going to live in Spain for a year, \"Because it was cheap. So,\" she says matter-of-factly, \"I had to learn Spanish. So, I learned Spanish to go to Spain-sat in on classes at Interlochen.\" They never did go to Spain, instead, the family moved a nU-Mber of times, first to Evanston, Illinois, where Fred played with the Chicago Symphony for several years, then to Fredonia, New York, back to Michigan at MSU, before they finally settled in Ann Arbor, where Fred taught at the U-M from 1984 until he retired in 2007. \"I was fortunate. I got a job every time we moved, one kind or another. After I learned Spanish, I added it to my teaching certificate and when we got here I got a job teaching Spanish at Ypsilanti High.\" She taught there till she retired in 1997. There were some momentous events along the way, and she glosses over them quickly. \"Fred and I divorced in 1990, and I met Z, Zoltan Drago, we got married; I inherited his kids, who were all grown at the time, and mine were just about too... He worked at Argus when Argus was contracted by NASA to do the lenses for the Apollo Mission. Therefore, he has lenses on the moon, and also in the Voyager that has left our solar system. Zoltan died in 2011. But we had twenty years, twenty years before he died. And I was married thirty-three years to Fred.\" The conversation turns back to music. Anne quit playing the clarinet after her sec- ond child was born. \"Who had time?\" But when she remarried, \"Zoltan's grandkids were learning musical instrU-Ments, and Mike said when he was ten, 'I am learn-ing to play the clarinet. You used to play the clarinet. We could play duets.' I went to Carty's to buy a clarinet. We had sold mine, I hadn't played for thirty years or more. There were clarinets hanging on the wall, red, white, blue, green, and yellow to co-ordinate with band uniforms. (Laughs) I said, 'Do you make these things in black anymore?' So, I bought a cheap, and not very good Bundy, plastic clarinet for almost what my parents paid in high school for my professional model Buffet.\" In three weeks, after she got her embouchure back, she started playing duets with her grandson. He eventually gave it up for football, \"But I did not give it up.\" And playing music fulfills another of her passions\u2014interacting with people and giving back. \" There are so many volunteer opportunities. It is always wonderful to be of some help to others. My volunteering is through music. This requires practice, rehearsals, the concerts themselves and travel time. All told, I volunteer around 500 hours each year to do these things. Besides the fun and absolutely emotionally thrilling time that my music groups give me, they also provide great opportuni- ties for travel.\" Anne goes to Interlochen every year for the adult Chamber Music weeks, has played in a Bands-at-Sea in the Caribbean every winter for the past seven years, travelled to Eastern Europe with the Dexter Community Band, to Scot - land with the MSU AlU-Mni Band, and to China with the Valparaiso \"Windiana\" Cultural Exchange Concert Band. Which brings us to another important theme in Anne's life, moving. Besides all, the travelling she still does, and her family's many moves, Anne has also long been, and continues to be very active physically. Last year I cross country skied with her in Miller Woods, \" This winter I only cross country skied twenty times, \"she says. \"I consider that not good. One winter gave me seventy times, here in Ann Arbor. I did every day at Interlochen.\" She ended one email exchange with me earlier this year with the following, \"PS. My pneU-Monia seems to be going away.... back to skiing.\"She says she swims every day possible during the sU-Mmer. She leads a hike for friends every year in Miller Park, \"To try to catch the Dames' Rockets at their peak.\" I have caught glimpses of her enjoying the swing sets in Maryfield Park, and have seen her biking on our neighborhood streets. \"I had a bike from the time I was ten. We didn't have kid's bikes, we had to learn on a full size. I learned on some neighbor kid's. I still have my first bike, a 1945 Elgin, made in Elgin, Illinois. I call it an all-speed because it will go as fast as you can pedal. (Laughter.) It's very big, red, and very heavy. I take it to Interlochen every year because I live in campus housing at the edge of camp, and I bike back and forth to every rehearsal, session, or meal. The car sits there parked for the entire two weeks. At one time, that bike had a kid seat behind the front handle bar and another kid's rigged-up seat over the back basket, so that I could take two kids at once. Now at Interlochen it carries instrU-Ments and music.\" Her second husband, Zoltan was a cyclist, and a member of the Ann Arbor Bicycle Touring Society, \"I started riding with him, and we did club rides.\" She still regularly joins the club's Tuesday South Lyon ride to Kensington Lake, the Friday Hines Drive ride, and the Saturday morning Ann Arbor to Dexter breakfast ride, though she rarely continues on to Chelsea, \"I have no reason to, the good stuff is at the Dexter Bakery.\" Of course, focusing only on her music and moving does not present a complete portrait of Anne. She's a proud mom of her kids, nine grandkids, and two great grandkids. She's a published, prize winning poet\u2014writing in both Spanish and English. She's an avid nature photographer, and transfers her photos into greeting cards for friends. And, in yet another example of her wit and imagination, she's also Founder, President, and CEO of Rent-a-Skunk International, a whimsical company inspired by Garrison Keillor's tales of his imaginary town of Lake Wobegone. She invited her son-in-law to be one of her vice-presidents. He agreed and she told him that while she's out of town at Interlochen for two weeks, \"You're in charge.\" (Laughter) \"The skunks are free range, I don't keep them anywhere. You may go catch your own. We rent them by the hour, the half day, the week, the month, the year. Why? Why not?\" Why not, indeed. Anne believes in the importance of continuing to learn and explore, \" To keep re-inventing your life as necessary, and to 'follow your dreams'.\" And she adds, almost sternly. \"If you have no dreams, find some. Our lives change. Life is a journey, and you have to adjust accordingly. You have to keep creating your new life. If you can no longer do a certain thing, you have to find new things to replace what you lost.\" Though she walks with a slight stoop, Anne's voice is vigorous, and she tells her stories with dramatic flair, punctuated by frequent and hearty laughter. She is happy to talk proudly about her kids' accomplishments, but tends to be very matter-of-fact about her own.

You spend a good part of your life breathing when and how the music dictates, NOT whenever you feel like it. You learn to breathe deeply and make the most out of every breath you take. This has to be a good exercise for maintaining good health. I continue to eat whatever I like, just not too much of it. I have always enjoyed being physically active: walking, running, tap dancing and later folk dancing, Contra, Square, English Country, skating, roller-blading, biking, scootering, skiing, both downhill and cross-country, swimming, water aerobics, and normal aerobics. I am not \"good\" at any of these things I just enjoy doing them. I think that being both physically and socially active are \"biggies\" in living a long and happy life. I feel very fortunate to be still doing most of these things.\" Anne and I share some similar, significant interests; music and being physically active are very big parts of my life too. But what has always struck me about Anne is her joie de vivre, her zest for living, and that's a quality we can all cultivate, no matter what are our unique interests and styles of living.

In the postpartum time a new mother is open and transparent. Her body has physically shifted and moved to allow the baby to pass through the birth canal. As this happens the protective and fortifying energy that keeps people feeling safe and sturdy, that feeling of having a strong backbone, thins, and allows for more emotions to flow through her. This is a natural process that helps a new mother open her heart to the child. Unfortunately, this also means that she is more emotionally vulnerable from outside sources as well. During the first few days and weeks postpartum, a new mother should keep secluded and quiet. This will support her in getting to know the new baby, learning to breastfeed, and encourage healing. Hosting, entertaining, cleaning, and cooking should all be left for others while the new mother bonds with the baby. New mothers are often depleted of essential minerals and vital nutrients at the time of birth. Not only can this lead to difficulty healing, it can also lead to difficulty feeding the baby. The strenuous work of birth leaves a mother low on essential vitality. From this state of natural depletion arises an opportunity for the mother to learn to accept support while focusing on the work of motherhood, which requires loving stillness and matching the much slower pace of a newborn. There are many ways to care for the new mother, including support, nourishment, rest, and love. Support a new mother by taking her day-to-day tasks and having them completed by those who love her. Nourish her with healing foods and herbs. Lovingly care for her by creating a cozy space for her to be in, give her massages, and allow her the space and time for abundant rest. Show the mother that she is worth your time, thoughts, and energy, and she will learn how, and when, to ask for support from those around her. This receiving of gifts, in whatever form, may be the hardest thing for mothers in our modern culture of the super-mom to receive, which is why it is so important to add this piece into our care of new mothers. It is so important for a new mother to be aware of where she is using her energy. The calories she consumes should be used for healing and making milk. That's it! Make a nest, make it cozy, make it a place where she can hunker down for hours at a time, and a place she will enjoy being in. Creating this space ahead of time can make a new mom feel prepared for anything. Having a beautiful environment can also make the postpartum time easier and more enjoyable. If the new mom feels like she needs a place to socialize, and a place to retreat, make two nests. The nest should include pillows to support her arms as she breastfeeds, a basket of snacks, and lots of water and herbal teas. Make this space feel really good! Add green plants, blooming flowers, her favorite books, beautiful art, and dark chocolate. Many cultures incorporate ritual into caring for the new mother. A beautiful way to incorporate ritual into this time is to allow for a gathering of community once the healing and nesting time is over. This can allow for the mother to look forward, knowing there are social events in her near future. She can spend some time planning, but also feel safe in her nest, healing, nourishing herself and her child, and bonding. Foods that are nourishing, warming, and easy to digest are going to give a new mother the greatest health benefit after birth. If the mother is able to absorb most of her nutrients without having to expend energy to keep herself warm, or digest food, she will be able to readily use the nutrition to heal her body and create an abundant milk supply. Broths are the ultimate bearer of health in postpartum. Bone broths will offer warmth, much needed fluids, essential vitamins and minerals, and healing collagen. Ideally a new mother should stick with lots of broth and soups for the first two weeks and then add more dense foods. Prepare broth ahead of time and stock your freezer with different varieties of broths and soups so she has choices! Recruit a loved one or a good friend and ask if they would be willing to help acquire seasonal vegetables. Stock up on what's available and looks delicious at the local market. Here in Michigan we make concessions in the winter months and buy produce from far away, but pay attention to what is available locally. In the colder months, root veggies such as potatoes, carrots, rutabagas, parsnips, and winter squash can be the perfect postpartum soup ingredients. Add ginger, garlic, chili peppers, seaweed, dark leafy greens, beans, and onions to taste. Be creative! Other foods to embrace are: nuts, oats, whole grains, lentils and other legumes. There is a delicious lactation nut-butter ball recipe, as well as a yummy creamy quinoa recipe that can be found on our website. Having a healthy relationship to food during the post-partum healing time matters too. Consuming foods that both make the new mom happy and make her feel healthy and nourished is vital. Having food lovingly prepared can increase the joyful feeling that comes from eating. Being aware of how we respond to food, and maintaining a gracious and grateful attitude, will help us instill a healthy relationship to food in our children. ### Katy Gladwin is a mother, wife, doula, certified wellness coach, childbirth educator, woman advocate, medical advocate, and activist of various sorts.

Medium size onion2-3 carrots2-3 stalks of celery1 TBSP white or apple cider vinegar1 gallon filtered water Roast bones with salt and pepper until slightly caramelized. Place bones in a large stock pot.Add one medium onion (cut in half), carrots (broken in half), stalks of celery (broken in half). Add vinegar (white or apple cider, this helps pull essential minerals from the bones) and a gallon of filtered water. Bring to boil. Once boiling, reduce to a slow simmer, so the surface of the water is just barely moving, but not boiling. Allow to simmer on low for 8-24 hours. When stock is ready, pour finished stock though a colander lined with cheesecloth into smaller containers. I like quart-sized, wide-mouthed ball jars, leaving about an inch between the broth and the lid, so there is room to expand when frozen. If using ball jars, I have found that my jars don't crack if I don't tighten the lids when I first put them into the freezer, but come back a few hours later and tighten them.This receiving of gifts, in whatever form, may be the hardest thing for mothers in our modern culture of the super-mom to receive, which is why it is so important to add this piece into our care of new mothers.Here in Michigan we make concessions in the winter months and buy produce from far away, but pay attention to what is available locally.

Starting in 2013 Boy Scouts of America was showing up in the news headlines for a variety of reasons. They overturned decades old policies barring gays from the program and became a more inclusive organization for all genders, at all levels of the organization. I found it interesting that around the world, Scouting has been a co-ed activity in several countries for decades \u2014 England, Germany, and Scandinavia to name a few. Finally, after years of mounting pressure from girls and their families, in October 2017, BSA announced they would openly accept girls at all levels of scouting (Cubs to Eagle Scouts) and consequently has changed its name from Boy Scouts of America to Scouts BSA in recognition of the fact that all genders are now welcome, removing the reference to Boys. Girls will now have the opportunity to pursue and earn the coveted Eagle Scout rank, and whole families, including girls, can participate in scout campouts together. Prior to this announcement only the Venturing and Sea Scouts programs, which are less well known, had been open to young adult men and women. When I look back upon these past eight years, I can see how impactful Scouts has been on my son when it comes to character development and self-confidence. I find myself recommending Scouts now to other young families, using some of the following examples as reasons. I remember how proud George was the day he earned a whittling chip, an early milestone which allowed him to carry a pocketknife. Whittling wood kept his hands busy when he was fidgety. He would spend hours making marshmallow roasting sticks, sharpening pencils, and making arrows from sticks in the yard. Not long after this, a rudimentary wood workshop appeared in the basement. Over the years, he made eco-friendly kitchen gadgets which he sold at children's art fairs, and he had fun building an impressive collection of award winning (and losing) pinewood derby cars. Although my son wasn't reading until the summer after fourth grade, he never had self-esteem issues. I credit Scouts for helping him maintain this positive self-image and for developing his strengths. In middle school he started to pay attention to clothing. He observed that some boys in his class wore only athletic clothes year round. They would be mocked if they showed up wearing a button down shirt and a belt unless it was required for a performance. He told me he liked the fact that he can wear anything to school and nobody gives him a hard time. Wearing a Scouts uniform taught him how to dress nicely and to express himself by making choices about his attire. For the past few years in the fall, he walked from door to door around the neighborhood selling popcorn. He had to make eye contact, remember his pitch, and answer neighbor's questions. To his amazement, people bought popcorn, repeatedly, and he won prizes. Person to person, face-to-face communication is something many youth struggle with today. I am grateful that Scouts has helped my son see why this skillset is important and valuable. Having grown up with the same 15-20 children in his class at school, it was refreshing for George to walk into a room full of boys from different schools and backgrounds. Weekly interactions at Troop meetings expanded his social circle and his self-awareness. Because young men are in charge of running the meetings, he observed effective and ineffective styles of leadership. He had to advocate for himself and his desire to eat healthy when planning campout meals and take initiative with adults The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 68 By Kendra Theriot When our kids reached school age in Ann Arbor in 2008 Scouts wasn't even on our radar screen. We weren't into camping and we weren't affiliated with a church. In fact, we were still discovering all the wonderful activities available in the area! So when my son, George, said he wanted to join cub scouts with his 1st grade classmate, I hesitated. Cub Scouts was led by parent volunteers and my plate was crowded with other commitments and a full time job. Fortunately, my husband was in grad school so he stepped up to give it a try with our son. Boy Scouts was started back in 1907 in England by a British Army officer, General Robert Baden-Powell. He wrote the first Scouting Handbook . As it was translated into other languages, other countries created Scouts programs around the world. Scouts came to the USA in 1910 and its original headquarters was in Chicago, but soon moved to New York City, and in 1979 moved to Irving, Texas where it has remained. Back in 1910, The Latter Day Saints formed a partnership with Boy Scouts of America (BSA), whereby BSA provided the Latter Day Saints with a strong youth leadership program for their boys. At the end of 2018, Scouts and the Church of Latter Day Saints have agreed to end their partnership after over 100 years. The program, requirements, and handbook language have evolved and modernized over the decades, however, the core principles and mission have not changed. For the next few years George and his classmate advanced through the Cub Scout ranks (tiger, lion, and wolf) together and walked over the bridge to become Webelos. My husband attended the weekly meetings and went on adventure activities while I remained on the sidelines. Fast forward to the present. We are eight years into this journey. Our son has reached Life Scout rank, a few steps away from Eagle Scout. He has a leadership role in his troop, and there are now teenage girls interested in forming their own unit coming to meetings. The scene is quite different from the parent led Cub Scout packs. About a year ago, I started hanging out at troop meetings to witness youth leadership in action and to understand how merit badges are earned. To my surprise many doctors, professors, and tech company executives from the area attended meetings each week. The intelligentsia of Ann Arbor was gathered in the basement of the church, enthusiastically supporting the boys. Feeling slightly guilty for being so uninvolved for so long, I volunteered to do a community service day and worked alongside the boys cleaning the church basement and went to dinner with some parents. Encouraged by what I saw, I even signed up to chaperone a ski trip last winter. It felt good to be off the sidelines and on the court. It was actually fun (like my husband said) and the trips were very well organized, reasonably challenging, and provided space and time to bond as a group. Not surprisingly, it was my husband who suggested I write this article. He surmised that there were other parents out there who had written off Scouts when it was heavy parent involvement and never reconsidered it when their kids were older. In addition, there are several changes that have taken place within the Scouting organization, which make it a more inclusive and welcoming place for all families. Why Boy Scouts? Why Now? Eagle Court of Honor, Troop 5 and their families, Calvary Methodist Church, May 6, 2018 The program, requirements, and handbook language have evolved and modernized over the decades, however, the core principles and mission have not changed. To my surprise many doctors, professors, and tech company executives from the area attended meetings each week. The intelligentsia of Ann Arbor was gathered in the basement of the church, enthusiastically supporting the boys. Girls will now have the opportunity to pursue and earn the coveted Eagle Scout rank, and whole families, including girls, can participate in scout campouts together. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 69 to complete merit badges. These experiences helped prepare him for the transition to public high school and real life. In addition, the emphasis on outdoor survival on high adventure trips deepened his appreciation for nature and the elements. He discovered he had the grit and determination required to meet the challenges on trail, and now, in school as well. Scouting also expanded George's interest in building and flying model planes to piloting real planes. One Scout parent, a Delta pilot, took him flying in his own private plane to fulfill a flight merit badge requirement. My son went through the preflight checklist with him, understood how the instruments worked, and then had a chance to fly the plane. At age 14, these kinds of experiences make a lasting impression. The relationships that youth form with adults in Scouts are of a genuine nature. These are just a sampling of the experiences Scouts can offer youth. As I researched I discovered I could make a strong case for the question, why join Scouts now? What makes Scouts relevant today? The Scouts program helps youth develop their own voice and the self-confidence to effectively lead others. As they advance in the program, they gain practice leading projects, eventually building up to an Eagle community project. The rigor and persistence required to earn an Eagle scout rank is noteworthy. In addition to the 24 required merit badges, all Eagle scouts must plan and lead a year-long community service based project. This project involves fundraising, leadership, and community coordination, and it must be completed and reviewed by the council before the Scout turns 18. A very small number of Scouts actually complete these requirements. In high school there are many demands on students. As a result, most college admissions offices look fondly upon an Eagle Scout on college applications. Eagle Scouts are eligible for scholarships and the armed services will promote an Eagle to a higher rank just by virtue of them achieving this status. The benefits of earning an Eagle scout rank are many but there is an incredible education to be had whether your son or daughter ever reaches that or not. While there is a rough equivalent in the Girl Scouts \u2014the Gold Award\u2014the honor is not nearly as well-known as the Eagle Scout distinction. But GSUSA says girls who earn the Gold Award also reap benefits, including college scholarships and the chance to skip a rank in the military Scouts' direct communication skills improve every time they sell popcorn to the public, or meet with their merit badge counselors to discuss what they have learned in the past week about fishing, biking, space exploration, citizenship, budgeting, flight, or other interests. The wide ranging education that takes place in Scouts is invaluable and complementary to what is taught in most schools. It is the life skills, people skills, and survival skills that are reinforced year round that make Scouts a stand out program.

If they like camping, once a month they can spend a weekend outdoors, away from the pressures of home, school, and social media. Scouts is affordable in comparison to other youth activities. To join it costs $33 in annual dues plus the cost of a uniform. Scholarships are available if needed. Scouts subsidizes the cost of many outings. Last year we went on a downhill ski trip weekend for $45 per person and a whitewater rafting weekend in Pennsylvania for $60 per person. Full week sleepaway summer camps are $250-$350 all inclusive. If you have a son or daughter who could use help discovering their own strengths, Scouts may be just the thing that sparks a desire in them to learn about themselves and find their own hobbies and interests. How Scouting benefits Adults Scouts can help adults fulfill their desire as parents to raise well-rounded kids who can lead and provide for themselves as well. Adults involved voluntarily in Scouts over the long term tell me they are really there because they enjoy watching the boys develop and become responsible young men. \"There is no greater joy than supporting this transformation process,\" said a Scoutmaster about his past 25 years. One of the parents described parent involvement in a Scout Troop as the \"stage crew\". Adults are behind the scenes supporting Scouts who are the true leaders. However, being stage crew is easier said than done. Planning a meal for a group or cleaning up after one can take longer than you might think it should. When an adults steps in, he or she deprives the youth of an important leadership opportunity as well as the chance to build their own character and use their own voice. Adults can be involved even when their own children choose not to be involved or outgrow Scouts. One way this can happen is by becoming a merit badge counselor. Regardless of your area of expertise, you may already qualify as an expert in one or more of the 130 badges now available to Scouts.Why Boy Scouts? Why Now? As part of a Family Life badge, this spring George wanted to plant a vegetable garden. He measured the area and made lists of supplies he needed. We shopped for the supplies together but he did all the talking at the hardware store. At the plant nursery, he asked me what herbs I wanted and made a list of vegetables our family would eat. He found an inexpensive way to protect it from the deer and watered it daily. These planning and execution skills are basic, but they are forming important building blocks for success in life. We would not have a garden managed by a teenager if it were not for my son and the Boy Scouts. Finding and Joining a Troop Since the announcement that girls are now welcome in BSA, reports are that over 3000 girls have joined the 170 or so Cub scout packs participating across the country. As of February 2019, girls ages 11-17 will be able to form their own units within existing BSA Troops nationally. Troops will have separate units - one for boys and one for girls so that girls will have equal leadership opportunities within their own units. It may come as a surprise to some that Scouting is a global enterprise. There are believed to be 38 million Scouts globally and active Scout organizations have been reported in 216 countries. In America there are currently 2.3 million boy scouts and just under 2 million girls scouts. In the USA, Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts have both struggled with declining membership in recent years. Boy Scouts reached its peak membership back in 1972 when the charts hit 6.5 million scouts, but has been on a gradual decline since then. This could be due to competition from other activities, especially in urban areas, and a national trend showing a decline of volunteerism in the US. You can join a Pack or Troop at any time during the year. Many kids join in the fall as part of the back to school program. Others attend a Troop or Pack open house or meet and greet in February. If you prefer, you can contact the Scout master of the troop you are interested in and ask if you can attend/observe a couple of weekly meetings before you make the commitment. Consider practical things such as location and timing of the regular weekly meetings. Talking to parents is helpful.

It is a 15 year old in charge! They goof off and take breaks, but eventually get down to business. Scouts is greater than the sum of its parts. It is grounded in old-fashioned values and yet still relevant in our modern day society. The youth-led aspect of Scouts is what sets it apart from other youth programs. The fact that it accepts a diverse set of kids across genders, and has adults willing to volunteer, will ensure the success of Scouting over the long term. There are many choices in life but few that yield long-lasting results. If you are committed to raising your children to be responsible citizens, capable of living independently, and appreciating natural surroundings, Scouts may be just the thing for your family.

Cowan If you have never had a kid leave trombone spit on your floor, you haven't really lived. Seriously though, parenting kids through music lessons can be a unique and rewarding experience. Music lessons really teach kids a different set of life skills than they could get from any other activity \u2014 from self-awareness to fine motor skills to better listening and introduction to meditation. Today there are tons of options that fit every family, schedule, and kid. People often discuss when to start their kids on music lessons with me, partly because my daughter loves piano lessons, and partly because my in-laws are both music teachers in Ann Arbor. When my daughter asked after voice lessons, they said she was too young, and this got me thinking. What is the right age for different types of music lessons, and how do you know when your kid is ready? Fortunately for kids in Ann Arbor, there are many choices around here for music lessons of every kind, so I set off to ask some local teachers about the right timing and prep, and some unique and fun options, for music lessons at every age. The answers I got were expert and professional. This town is chock full of amazing music teachers of all kinds. First of all, is it ever too soon to start your kids on music lessons? For the basics, no. Tiger moms rejoice. There are fantastic options for exposing your kids to the wonderful world of music, even from birth. From the Get-Go Robin Robinson, founder of the Music Together programs for kids, Robinsongs in Ann Arbor, teaches children as young as infants in her group music classes off of Miller and North Maple in a new dedicated music studio. Her programs for children combine play-based musical activities, songs, rhythmic games, and a cozy family environment with parents participating to support their kids in discovering enthusiasm for music. It might sound simple, but Music Together programs are research-based classes that allow children to teach themselves through discovery of music. The classes feature structured but varied song programs, from the weekly welcome song to a carefully designed arc of activities and singalong fun, ending in a peaceful goodbye song. Through the class, the kids get their bodies moving and are welcome to call out and participate in each activity as much or as little as they choose. I visited a class for infants and pre-K at Robinsongs and was surprised at how friendly and welcoming yet polished the program was. \"The most important thing is your participation,\" Robinson told the parents, \"then the kids are more likely to be engaged.\" Honestly, the only downside I could see to this is that these classes require a lot of energy from moms who might sometimes need a bit of a break from playing with their kiddos. But the structure of the activities was superb. \"It's not about performing,\" Robinson assured everyone. Children grinned and sang along with the call and response of different rhymes through the class. One child sat on Robinson's lap, comfortably going back and forth between Robinson and her mother. Another cheered as a song ended. Beehives buzzing, tickling, counting, and callback rhythms all feature in Music Together classes. For older kids, there are drum circle rhythm classes that are age appropriate once the kids develop the right foundational skills. I thought this was a pretty cool alternative to piano lessons for kids with a taste for drums. Even the infant and pre-K classes allow kids to explore maracas, shaker eggs, and rhythm sticks to play along with the music. The most impressive thing about Robinsongs is that the organization features multiple professional teachers, and Robinson herself is quite proficient in everything she does. This is not a thrown-together mommy hangout. Robinson has a degree in musical theater from the University of Michigan and worked in New York before returning to Ann Arbor, sings professionally, plays guitar, is exceptionally friendly, is great with small children, and runs her own business. On the second week of this class I visited, she already knew all the dozen children's names in the pre-K class. You can see her passion for children and her work in everything she does. Timing Is Everything What is the right time to start music lessons that teach kids to read sheet music, and where do you start? For piano, former Ann Arbor Piano Teachers Guild president, local teacher, and my intrepid mother-in-law, Heidi Cowan, said it varies by teaching method. Traditional teachers like Mrs. Cowan say it's often a good idea to start around kindergarten or a little after. Even age seven to nine is a great time to get going. Though, Mrs. Cowan told me, Suzuki method teachers like Ann Arbor veteran Renee Robbins would have a different approach. I sat down with Renee Robbins to ask her about her decades of experience starting kids on the piano, and she confirmed what Mrs. Cowan had told me. Robbins also is a former president of the piano teachers guild, and a long-time favorite teacher on the West Side of Ann Arbor. In her teaching method, children begin by hearing rhythms and melodies in music, and reading notes on the page comes at a later stage. That means, they can start as young as preschool. Music lessons really teach kids a different set of life skills than they could get from any other activity \u2014 from self-awareness to fine motor skills to better listening and introduction to meditation.

He told me that he starts kids at ten years old, because the size of their bodies needs to be big enough to hold a woodwind instrument and their fingers to cover the holes on a recorder or clarinet. \"About middle school they graduate up to brass and larger instruments, like coronets and trombones,\" he told me, \"and then bass clarinet or tenor, alto clarinet or euphonium or tuba.\" Dr. Cowan also said that band leaders in town have lots of training about when to start kids at different ages on early instruments and then transfer them over. Since the public schools provide instruments to try in elementary schools, there isn't such an expensive outlay at the beginning to try an instrument. Children are graduated to higher quality instruments as well as larger ones. Dr. Cowan said, \"Generally, by high school, if someone is serious in this town, they want to be playing on a professional grade instrument by sophomore year.\" But, he said, that's relatively easy to make happen with all the orchestras and groups kids can join through their school careers. KinderConcerts Gari Stein teaches early childhood music classes similar to Robinsongs, but her setup is a little different. She tells me: Classes are geared for babies to five and are based in the richness of traditional folk music with a format specifically designed for very young children that covers all elements of music making. Enhancing listening skills, an important component, is emphasized throughout the curriculum. Snack and art experiences are provided with time for independent instrument exploration. Music For Little Folks is a little community with space for adults to chat and connect. KinderConcerts are an additional free series of performances that expose kids to different kinds of music. They are hosted by local libraries, from Ann Arbor to Dexter to Chelsea and Ypsi, and are sponsored by the Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra. KinderConcerts combine classical music with jazz and other genres. Guest musicians engage children in follow the leader, dancing with scarves and other props, and end in a lullaby. Besides hosting KinderConcerts and teaching Little Folks Music classes, Stein also runs a unique class at the Ann Arbor YMCA. Nurturing Baby and You: Music and Support is a group specifically designed for infants and babies. Stein said: \"Being with these precious little ones is a joyous experience [that] fills my heart and nourishes my soul. And it's not just for the little ones. Connecting with the grownups is a bonus; an ice cream sundae with whipped cream on top. All children are born with the potential to be musical and music speaks to every child. Simply by singing and dancing together, we nurture that potential. No expertise needed. Childhood need not be rushed. What's the hurry?\" I admit I love her attitude about relaxed and nurtured learning, even though I benefited from an ambitious practice schedule when I played piano from childhood ...

These days as a mom I'm more cognizant of the pressures kids face, and I, like many other moms, am looking for balance and a workable schedule for my kid that teaches her positive reinforcement and hard work in a peaceful context. There's plenty of variety in what people want for their kids' music education, but the pressures of being a kid today seem to be a growing concern among parents, and a factor in Gari Stein's relaxed family approach. She told me: \"Many years ago, one of my moms from Sing With Me said, 'This class reminds me that there is still peace and calm in the world...' Even after all these years, as I look out on the cuddling families and the smiling faces, there is this moment in time when there is peace and calm and all is well with the world. A beautiful warmth washes over me. Every time.\" I have to say these days I really resonate with that. Like many parents, I'm looking for ways to create peace in my family life and make space for gentle learning, to buffer out some of the harshness of the world. \"These are challenging times,\" Stein said. \"A simple song can slow things down, and instantly transform a cranky environment into one of calm and peace. It is a tool readily available in a frustrating situation and will help us get through transitions.\" Suzuki Piano There will always be plenty of kids who love music and are self-motivated learners, and they thrive with Renee Robbins' piano lessons. \"I started playing piano when I was three,\" she told me. \"My brother played the violin, and my mother played music.\" What's it like to be a piano teacher for more than 50 years? Robbins is the kind of teacher who doesn't just teach piano. She loves her students and not just teaching music but \"exploring the messages it teaches us, what meanings and emotions come through a piece.\" Robbins starts teaching children to learn piano by ear at a young age, then starts them reading music about the same time Heidi Cowan recommended: somewhere between five and eight years old, depending on how they're progressing and their learning style. \"Usually within a year or two of beginning to read [music] they really read,\" she said. Learning to read music is a \"very gradual process, and differs a lot with different kids.\" \"The kids who do the best have families who play music, not necessarily professionally,\" Robbins said. \"They like it.\" She has a problem with parents who put their kids in music lessons to increase their brain power but don't do it themselves. Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community Strike Up The Band This is a great point. We all know the mom who insists on her kids packing in music as well as academics, but even if that is effective for enhanced academic success and self-discipline and creativity, how many of these parents invest in themselves the same way? The majority of Robbins' students have parents who play music. She seems enthusiastic about the continued boom of families who want their kids in piano lessons. Even after all these years, she's still plenty busy at her studio. You can see from talking with Robbins that she is deeply invested as a teacher. \"No two people in the world are the same, so they all have different approaches to music,\" she said. \"Their families have different styles, which affect how kids learn.\" \"Music is soul-filling,\" Robbins tells me. \"We're not there to be better than someone else.\" That being said, she tells me it's unpredictable which students will stick with music past middle school. She believes it's her job to probe what the kids love and what motivates them, so she can encourage them to keep motivated when music gets hard. Also, whether kids stick with it can depend on parent involvement, and how that works with a kid's natural preferences. Suzuki parents often attend lessons early on and only gradually fade into the background of their kids' studies, while with a more traditional piano teacher like Heidi Cowan, parents more often drop kids off at lessons and support their practice from a distance unless they have more musical training, which is sometimes a better fit for parents or kids. Unusual Choices for Music Lessons What comes after piano and basic music instruction? For the kid who isn't going to sit still for piano lessons, or is too young to start an instrument, where can you go? Ann Arbor has lots of cool choices. As mentioned before, the public schools have great programs and direction for getting kids into orchestras and bands and helping them try new instruments at appropriate ages. For kids not in the public schools or who want something a little different, there are several \"schools of rock\" around town that teach rock band instruments like electric guitar, drums, bass, and the like. These schools pull kids together in rock band groups for practice and performances. The Ann Arbor School of Rock, located on Jackson Road west of town, and The Ann Arbor Music Center and Rock Band School, on Ashley near the heart of downtown, both offer unique rock band instruction and group practice. Religious institutions in the area also provide opportunities for kids to sing in choirs, or in faith specific smaller groups. One of the best ways to get involved is to ask around any faith-based groups or theater and music performance groups for leads on private teachers who can recommend the right fit. Guitar lessons or instruction in instruments such as mandolin are available all over Ann Arbor at various studios, such as Oz's Music, and can lead to other stringed instrument studies. Until the recent end of Herb David Guitar Studio downtown, it was possible to take sitar lessons. The new Ann Arbor Guitars, which took over the Herb David space on Liberty, still repairs guitars, mandolins, and other stringed instruments with expert skill. Shar Instruments on South Industrial is another great resource where parents can rent violins and violas and basses and inquire after private lessons.

Then they can branch out as their skills bloom and their personal preferences emerge. It's uniquely rewarding to watch a kid discover music. I can see why music teachers in the area are respected for their decades of experience and high-level training. It's a beautiful thing to see how much they love the work and love their students after so many years on the job. For kids who stick with it, there are award-winning youth orchestras and bands at the public high schools. At Solo & Ensemble auditions teens can win medals for group and solo performances that test their developing musical skills, and at the Ann Arbor Piano Teachers Guild auditions kids push past their individual lessons to performance-level competitions. I didn't realize until I was an adult how lucky I was to have a friend in a concert pianist living next door as a kid, as well as world-class teachers available to me, even though I didn't pursue music in college. As a student slightly awkwardly between the typical level of experience and what would be required to get into a higher end music school, I was blessed to have the option to take piano lessons for credit with a grad student at the University of Michigan School of Music when I was a freshman at U-M and an English major. You have to look around a bit to find these options, but if your child keeps studying, these kinds of opportunities are everywhere in Ann Arbor. World-class violin instructors at the University of Michigan School of Music sometimes take on young students to mentor, which my husband took full advantage of when he was a kid. The University of Michigan also runs the Interlochen Center for the Arts in Northern Michigan, where kids can audition for the All-State two-week summer camp from an early age through high school, or attend longer programs up to full-time boarding school for arts and music. And then there are other camps and music schools and competitions to move on to. First things first, though. Learning to read music and develop a lifelong love of rhythm and melody are some of my fondest memories of growing up in Ann Arbor, and ones I hope to pass on to my daughter. Like me, she loves to practice piano, but not play scales, and loves to improvise, but not in public. I hope to nurture her love of music in the way that's best for her. It's a tricky balance with everything kids have going on in their schedules these days, but it's well worth some family time around the piano. Playing violin or harmonica or the piano together are some of our fondest memories together as a family. ### More information about Robinsongs can be found at robinsongsforkids.com.

Chickadees are one of a handful of birds that stay in Michigan when the snow comes calling and their songs are sure to lift your spirits when the day is gray. This little chickadee pin looks deceitfully hard to make, but is really rather easy. It will make a great gift for a friend who needs a bit of a mid-winter cheer.

Using a straight stitch, add details down the bird's chest, and above wing. Be sure to overlap the top of the wing just a bit to soften the edge. Keep your straight stitch shorter near the head, and a bit longer on the body. Also keep in mind the direction feathers lay on the body. You don't want to stitch across the chest and belly, but in the direction of chin to belly. 6. Add a bit of wing detail with one strand of gray embroidery floss over top of wing and longer stitches on right edge of wing. Continue with long stitches over the white part of the wing. 7.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 81 Many people are unaware that there are natural healing options for pets that are similar to methods used for humans. I am often asked how pets respond to these natural healing methods. \"Do dogs really sit still for acupuncture?\" \"How do you get them to do their exercises for rehabilitation?\" \"Do you actually see any response to herbal therapy in pets?\" \"How do you do massage on a painful pet?\" We often choose to combine natural, holistic methods with conventional Western medical treatments to augment the efficacy and decrease undesirable side effects. Treatments such as acupuncture, veterinary spinal manipulation, massage, Reiki, and physical rehabilitation, as well as herbal and nutritional therapy, can really improve pain management and mobility in your pet. These types of treatments could all be described as veterinary physical medicine and are a wonderful adjunct to conventional medications; this is often termed a \"multi-modal approach,\" and can have some amazing results. In instances where there are underlying metabolic or gastrointestinal issues that preclude the use of many medications, we are often able to find alternative ways to manage pain. Rehabilitation and physical medicine can also improve pain management when medications alone are not providing enough relief. Let's look at an example of one patient and follow his journey to get a better understanding of how this might look. Duffy, a 12-year-old Labrador Retriever, came to us in the beginning of November 2013 because he was having significant arthritis pain that compromised his mobility. He had a long history of significant arthritis, even as a young dog, in his right ankle. As a 5-year-old, Duffy had injured a ligament in his left knee, underwent surgery, and had quite a few complications with infection and bone healing. He had always had trouble with his right rear leg, but in recent months, was unable to go for walks with his owner and seemed to be in more pain, despite being on multiple medications and supplements. Where he used to be able to walk three miles with his owner, he was only able to walk three to four blocks at a time. His owner's biggest concern was his comfort, but she also felt that he was unhappy not being able to participate in his walks as he used to. After meeting with them and assessing Duffy's condition, we decided to use a combination of natural methods to see if we could improve pain management and also improve strength and mobility. Duffy had significant arthritis in his hips, knees, right ankle, elbows, and right wrist, as well as a sore back, which we assumed was secondary to having arthritis in at least one major joint in each leg. We focused on improving comfort in his back and arthritic joints using a combination of spinal manipulation, massage, acupuncture, herbal therapy, and rehabilitation (including laser therapy), core strengthening, and flexibility exercises.Duffy came in weekly for sessions, and his owner would do his strength and flexibility exercises for 10-15 minutes twice daily at home between visits. We used spinal manipulation to restore motion to the stiff or tender areas of his spine, allowing inflammation to recede. The spinal manipulation was coupled with massage to relieve tight and painful muscles, as well as to improve circulation to all four limbs. We also performed acupuncture to improve his pain management, overall energy and happiness, and laser therapy on his back and arthritic joints to decrease inflammation and increase the rate of tissue repair. We taught Duffy and his owner core strengthening and flexibility exercises, which we performed during his sessions, and then had his owner continue at home daily. We added an herbal product containing boswellia and turmeric to further decrease inflammation and mimic the effect of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The results were life changing for Duffy and his family. He was able to get up with ease, wanted to participate in many aspects of daily living that his owner thought he was just too old to care about, and resumed his daily walks, working back up to his three miles. At one of his visits just before Christmas of 2013, Duffy's owner confessed to me that when they first came to us, she had thought Duffy would not still be with them by Christmas; instead, he was able to walk three miles again, and she and Duffy were thrilled! While not all pets will respond as well as Duffy did to therapy, in reality, many pets do have similar outcomes. Signs that there may be more we could be doing to improve comfort and quality for geriatric pets include: difficulty getting up or lying down, trouble getting onto furniture or up and down stairs, and decreased ability to go for walks without slowing down, sitting or becoming obviously sore. There could be more subtle signs as well, which may include: decreased interaction with family, decreased appetite, restlessness or panting, increased irritability or reluctance to play with toys, other pets, or you. If you are seeing these types of symptoms, please check with your primary care veterinarian, who may run blood work or take radiographs as part of their exam. Once any major health issues are addressed, this is the perfect time to see what rehabilitation and physical medicine can offer to ease symptoms, improve mobility, and increase everyday enjoyment for you and your pet. Dr. Mary Cardeccia has practiced small animal medicine and surgery since 1995, moving gradually from general practice to complementary veterinary medicine, starting with her acupuncture class in 2007, and most recently with her canine massage class. You can find her practice, Animal Rehabilitation Facility, at 8040 Fourth Street, Dexter, MI 48130. To make an appointment call: 734-253-2722 or visit them online at: www.k9rehabmi.comChristmas for Duffy By Dr. Mary Cardeccia, DVM Treatments such as acupuncture, veterinary spinal manipulation, massage, Reiki, and physical rehabilitation, as well as herbal and nutritional therapy, can really improve pain management and mobility in your pet. He had always had trouble with his right rear leg, but in recent months, was unable to go for walks with his owner and seemed much more painful, despite being on multiple medications and supplements. At one of his visits just before Christmas of 2013, Duffy's owner confessed to me that when they first came to us, she had thought Duffy would not still be with them by Christmas; instead, he was able to walk three miles again and she and Duffy were thrilled!

However, some may say these are only the superficial benefits of meditation. Are there greater benefits from a truly deep meditation? A more meaningful meditation begins when brain function has \"stopped\", or in other words, when the ego is gone. If we cannot enter the \"brain non-function stage\", we are just sitting quietly and peacefully. You may ask how one stops brain function? Is it even possible? It is possible and simple. The practice is called Huayen Chan Kuan. Chan is an ancient practice, originating in China in the 6th century. According to history, there were 300,000 to 400,000 great Chan practitioners in between the years of 618-1279 AD. Unfortunately, Chan Kuan practice almost disappeared with the Yun Dynasty (1279 AD). Only about 100 practitioners were successful in the following 800 years because of civil war. A human brain is in a constant process of thinking as long as the person is awake, as the brain is simultaneously receiving external stimuli from all five senses. One special technique that can pause this thinking process is called inner body heat exercise, which includes two major groups of exercise. The first group is referred to as \"body adjustment techniques\". This group refers to a variety of cleansing/purifying exercises, such as yoga Asana, 8-reverse Gong Fu, Yoga dance, walking meditation, and other similar practices. The purpose of these exercises is to adjust the body and restore its systems back to their normal function.The second group is called \"life energy guiding techniques\". This group is composed of different methods of breath control. These exercises can make breathing smooth and efficient, so that the nervous system becomes calm and stabilized. This is beneficial to both physical and mental well-being. If one can properly use inner strength to activate internal organs, the \"inner heat\" will arise. This \"inner heat\" can initiate the cleansing process and improve health. When the inner heat is strong enough, to the level that the body moves spontaneously without conscious control, then it is possible to momentarily stop the brain thinking function. Once the body reaches this critical point, it is liberated from any conscious controlling, and the innate life energy explodes. The negative energies that have accumulated over the years are released gradually. This is the first reward of Huayen Chan Kuan. The two distinct stages in Chan Kuan practice are: To-be-dynamic and To-be-static. The dynamic stage emphasizes body purification and cleansing through inner heat exercises. These techniques can spark the innate life energy. In the to-be-static stage, energy is gradually accumulated and refined within the body, until \"Pran\" is formed. Pran is pure vital energy\u2014the essence of life. This static phase is the real starting point of Huayen Chan Kuan meditation. Through this practice, one can gradually experience the true spirit and gain true wisdom. Ordinary life will be completely transformed, and one steps into the Dharma Realm.

Master HaiYun is able to integrate this practice with traditional Chinese Chan practice based on his years of training and achievement. This unique Huayen Chan Kuan practice has become widely observed throughout the world, including here at the Triple Crane Monastery. We also offer Classical Hatha yoga classes, Chan Kuan workshops, and weekend retreats. These basic trainings will purify one's body, speech, and mind.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 95 By Hattie Peraino Healing Touch is an energy healing modality which has grown nationwide over the last decades. Represented around the world, and endorsed by the American Holistic Nurses Association, Healing Touch uses a gentle, light, or off body touch to balance chakra energies, reduce pain, and relieve mental and physical stress. It is a holistic model of care, working in tandem with modern medical practices, which encour - ages the client to participate in their own healing process. The practitioner is 'the straw', channeling high vibratory energy to the client for their highest and greatest good. Evolved from the organization founded in 1996 by Janet Mentgen, RN, Healing Beyond Borders is a nonprofit professional organization, offering a rigorous educa-tion program which certifies Healing Touch practitioners. Students participate in five levels of classes which train them in the techniques and ethical practice of this heal - ing modality. The process takes approximately two years to complete and includes reading and reviewing fifteen books related to healing techniques and the philoso - phy of energy healing, personally receiving and assessing the value of ten different alternative healing modalities and offering and charting treatments for 100 clients. A mentor guides and advises the student through this process in order to encourage the novice healer to develop higher awareness, skills, and focus. Healing Touch offers a wide variety of methods to clients, which are tailored to each individual's situation. Techniques are available to prepare the body for the best outcome pre/post-surgery, to reduce mental stress and mind clutter, to remove toxins from the body, particularly after chemotherapy treatments, and, of course, to ensure on-going self-care. A Legacy of Healing The Healing Touch Modality Offers Energy Healing Endorsed by Holistic Nurses Healing Touch uses a gentle, light, or off body touch to balance chakra energies, reduce pain, and relieve mental and physical stress.Once the benefits of Healing Touch are experienced, the energy starts to flow in many directions and the client is inspired to give back. The circle of giving and receiving begins to manifest. Healing Touch practitioner, Nancy Judge, is energizing a client's heart area. Healing Touch practitioners, Nancy Judge and Karen Matherly.During each session, practitioners gently work to smooth and balance the client's energy field in order to reenergize chakras and support the client's inherent abil - ity to self-heal. A pre and post interview provides the practitioner with specific information from the client in order to ensure the best outcomes. Often a client relates stories of personal loss, sources of stress, or the presence of physical pain. This information sets the context for the treatment but the healing techniques will always be directed by the flow of energy that the practitioner senses when working in the client's field. During the post interview clients may relate that they have seen colors, felt the release of congested energy, or experienced a renewed sense of in - ner peace and balance. Many practitioners start out as clients. When a client receives treatment, a sense of renewed well-being is most often the outcome. After several treatments, the client frequently becomes interested in sharing their story and helping others, whether it's family members, friends, coworkers, or even their pets! Once the benefits of Healing Touch are experienced, the energy starts to flow in many directions and the client is inspired to give back. The circle of giving and receiving begins to manifest. The leading Healing Touch locale in this region is the Healing Touch Center in Farm- ington Hills, which has been offering healing sessions to the general public for two decades, providing those who enter its serene healing environment the opportu - nity to balance their body, mind, and spirit. All of the work done at the Center in Farmington Hills is by volunteer practitio- ners. A number of Healing Touch practitioners offer sessions within the Ann Arbor community. Some serve as nurses in the U-M hospital system and are currently doing research on the benefits of Healing Touch in order to make sessions readily available to both patients who are undergoing hospital care, and family members who are supporting patients through treatment. Healing Touch is now offered to veterans in the Ann Arbor Hospital setting and at a number of hospice and out - reach facilities. As Deepak Chopra said, \"The universe operates through dynamic exchange... giving and receiving are different aspects of the flow of energy in the universe.\" Over 70 Healing Touch practitioners will gather together at the Center in March to celebrate its 20th birthday, and the legacy of healing that has been created. As the circle of giving and receiving expands, this life affirming work continues. For more information on the Healing Touch Center in Farmington Hills go to healing- touchcenter.info or leave a voice message at 248.788.5808 to schedule an appointment.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 98 by Cindy Klement In the fall of 2013 I attended a lecture on health. The presenter at the time used the term 'body burden.' I assumed that the burden he spoke of was that which most of us carry, meaning either our emotional burden or the burden of excess body weight. The term stuck with me for a very long time, piquing my curiosity. As a professor I have access to thousands of peer-reviewed scientific journals through the university online library, so one day I decided to see if searching 'body burden' would yield any published research. Much to my surprise over 420,000 journal articles were immediately at my fingertips and as I narrowed the search to only the previous three years, the database still revealed over 123,000 results. As I scrolled down through the selection I began to note that many of the articles were from prestigious journals such as Food Additives & Contaminants, Environmental Pollution , Environmental Health Perspectives , and Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, among many others. After downloading and reading several of the studies, I realized the term had more to do with the body's environmental chemical burden than the emotional or weight burden.The more I downloaded and read, the more alarmed I became, and I wanted to know which chemicals might be lurking silently in my body's tissues. I questioned whether or not there may indeed be some stored toxicant that could explain the idiopathic vertigo I had dealt with for almost sixty years, and as I learned more and more about the effects chemicals can have on our overall health, I was consumed. Results of My Toxicology Testing In March of 2014, I asked my dear friend and personal physician, Dr. Lev (Ed) Linkner, if we could run a toxicant profile using blood and urine. He told me to find the test I'd like to have and he'd be glad to order it. Genova Diagnostics offered a quite pricey Toxic Effects Profile that tested for 45 chemicals found in humans, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), chlorinated and organophosphate pesticides, PCBs, BPA, phthalates, and parabens. For a woman of 63 years who had been eating virtually organic since the late 1970s and had used the safest personal care and cleaning products for almost four decades, it came as a complete surprise when the results showed I was in the 80th percentile for benzene and styrene, the 95th percentile for PCB153, and had detectable levels of DDE, phthalates, pesticides, BPA, and parabens. Being in the 95 th percentile means only 5% of other individuals that were tested exceeded the level found in my body. I am not a chemist by any stretch of the imagination so I had absolutely no idea what these chemicals were, how they got into my tissue, or if I could ever get them out. Research CommencesI researched these chemical contaminants whenever I found extra time. From March of 2014 until the end of the year, I accumulated over 1,500 studies on the topic of the body's environmental chemical burden. I read each one of them (mostly on airplanes and in hotel rooms) and highlighted notes I felt were pertinent. I learned what the chemicals are used for, and how many millions (and sometimes billions or trillions) of pounds are produced around the world. I came to understand how we are exposed and the health effects that can occur both in humans and in the animal kingdom. With each new chemical I became increasingly concerned about the future of our children and their children. I especially worried for the millennial generation and the hardships they will face as a result of the worldwide environmental chemical contamination. Medical Training for Environmental Medicine In most medical training today there is a lack of information in the curriculum regarding environmental medicine, and yet in the United States alone it is estimated that 13% of disease is attributed to the environment, amounting to almost 400,000 deaths per year from cardiovascular disease, neuropsychiatric disorders, and cancer. Exposure to environmental chemicals is rarely even mentioned in initiatives to combat chronic diseases. Distinguished Professor Emerita at University of California Davis, Judith S. Stern, stated, \"our genetics may load the gun, but our environment pulls the trigger.\" Health care systems are not trained to address the contribution of environmental contaminants and their effects on the health of the human body. Many clinicians are not yet even aware of the science behind toxicant bioaccumulation and related health consequences, nor how or where their patients are exposed. Concerns Regarding Bioaccumulation Literature on the topic of the body's environmental chemical burden promotes controversy and ongoing debates. New chemicals are introduced without first being fully tested for toxicity, only to be taken off the market when harmful effects are proven. Bioaccumulation (slow concentrating of chemicals in the body) of chronic low-level exposure from multiple chemical sources makes it difficult to demonstrate cause and effect because most studies focus on a single chemical, although we are rarely exposed to just one contaminant. Concerns are mounting that exposure to different classes of chemicals and their breakdown products may actually enhance toxicity and intensify their effects. Different chemicals have different health outcomes and continuous exposure to a multitude of chemical types on a daily basis results in a slurry of chemicals with additive and/or synergistic effects in the body. The key challenge in research is to expose oneself to multiple sources of information, learn the chemical classes and the varying concentrations, and understand the overall health of the individual. Ethical Issues It is not ethical to expose study participants to potentially dangerous levels of environmental chemicals. Of the 85,000 synthetic chemicals manufactured over the past four decades, little toxicity information exists. In 1976, over 60,000 chemicals were grandfathered in when the United States Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act. As of 2010, 17,000 chemicals under the exemption are still in use and remain available to manufacturers, some of which have questionable safety ratings. Restricting Harmful Chemicals The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants aims to restrict or eliminate the use and production of 23 classes of chemicals. A use reduction policy in Understanding The Toxins Within an excerpt from the new book by local author,Cindy Klement The more I downloaded and read, the more alarmed I became, and I wanted to know which chemicals might be lurking silently in my body's tissues.In most medical training today there is a lack of information in the curriculum regarding environmental medicine, and yet in the United States alone it is estimated that 13% of disease is attributed to the environment.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 99 the United States has been met with political resistance, due to debates concerning the impact of policies on food processors and farmers, and on the price of food. In 2012 the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Health Organization updated their 2002 document State of the Science of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals to list key concerns for decision makers concerned about the health of humans and wildlife, indicating that the vast majority of chemicals have never been tested and that this lack of data establishes significant uncertainties about the factual and accurate extent of risks that could disrupt the endocrine system. The document states that up to 40% of men in certain countries have low semen quality; that penile malformations have increased over time in baby boys, as have non-descending testes. Prostate and testicular cancer have been increasing over the past 50 years and type 2 diabetes increased from 153 million to 347 million during the past 28 years. Females are experiencing more diseases involving the breasts, ovaries, endometrium, and thyroid gland. In 2013 the National Toxicology Program found that persistent organic pollutants, bisphenol A and phthalates, among other chemicals, were associated with diabetes and obesity in some of the populations studied. The World Health Organizations' International Programme on Chemical Safety listed 800 chemicals capable of interfering with hormone receptors, again acknowledging that the vast majority of chemicals have not been tested. Complications in Research Why one person might react to a specific contaminant and another does not has a great deal to do with multiple factors including age, nutritional status, overall health, genetic makeup, dietary and exercise habits, functioning of detoxification systems and the chemical's target organs, as well as the developmental stages at the time of exposure, and the level and frequency of exposure. Prenatal and Early Life Exposure Once regarded as protective, research has firmly established that the placental barrier does not shield the unborn from toxicant exposure. Over ten years ago studies determined that newborn cord blood contained an average of 287 toxicants. Breast milk and meconium studies have also revealed the passage of toxic chemicals to developing infants. Unfortunately, a number of these toxic compounds have long induction periods (the amount of time it takes to produce ill effects) so their impact won't be realized for many years. Because many of the chemicals resist elimination and persist in human tissue, there is an enormous potential to disrupt physiological processes. The Pediatric Academic Societies affirmed that the functioning of the current generation may be impacted by low-level exposure to environmental chemical toxicity. Some changes may extend for generations beyond that initially exposed, a type of effect known as epigenetic. The Human Early Life Exposome Project is researching early life exposure that begins prenatally and continues through developing years. Contact to flame retardants on bedding and sleepwear; bathing in or drinking chlorinated water; the use of personal care products, breathing vehicle exhaust or chemical air-fresheners; exposure to off-gassing in building materials inside the home or child care center; plastic bottles, utensils, and dishware; pesticides, artificial colors, flavors and preservatives in foods; house cleaning products and disinfectants, all add to the body burden of children. The project's goal is to better understand how chemical exposures influence the risk of disease. Who's in Charge? Chemical policies in the U. S. are structured so that the Food and Drug Administration is responsible for cosmetics, food contaminants, medical devices and drug ingredients, yet within the FDA multiple divisions carry out their work in isolation from other departments thereby limiting their concerns to products in their own sector. As an example the Environmental Protection Agency determines whether or not to permit phthalates in a pesticide formula, while the Consumer Products Safety Commission only considers the amount of phthalates that may leach out of a toy as a child chews on it. No single agency is sanctioned to look at the big picture. The P aradigm is Shifting A paradigm shift in science sometimes occurs painfully slow due in part to those who won't give up firmly held beliefs, some of which have defined their careers. Paracelsus, a 16 th century Swiss German physician, proposed that \"the dose makes the poison,\" however toxicologists today are challenging this outdated assumption because many of the effects of harmful chemicals observed at low doses don't necessarily occur at higher doses, and the opposite has also been observed. Sadly, over the next hundreds of years, humans will be forced to co-exist with the chemicals found in our environment. We can't avoid every one of them, but we can use the tools and resources at our disposal to reduce our exposure. We can also detoxify the body as best we can with what we know now. My Sincere Hope for Future GenerationsMy hope is that every one of our young millennials will get their bodies and homes as cleared of chemicals as possible before bringing children into this incredibly polluted world. It's important for them to detoxify their own bodies as much as possible so the sperm is vital and healthy, and so females have fewer contaminants to pass on to their infants through the placenta and through breast milk. Everyone needs to be aware of what they can do to avoid adding to the body's environmental chemical burden, especially those contemplating future parenthood. I sincerely hope this resource guide to understanding and avoiding toxins will help guide you to the best health possible for yourself, your children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.Cindy Klement, MS, CNS, MCHES, has been involved in holistic health since the late 1970s and is currently an adjunct professor at Eastern Michigan University.

It either seems vague, or worse, we feel like our life is at odds with our purpose. We have competing responsibilities, but many of them don't line up with what we want to do. Fortunately, these days there are many systems for identifying purpose and areas of strength or opportunities for growth in our careers or personal lives. The SUN SHEN One Prayer is one of these systems. It's not therapy, but rather a system of journaling and cultivation through contemplation, insights, and growth to help us identify which areas of our life we would like to nurture. The SUN SHEN One Prayer is your own \"virtual monastery,\" where you get the benefits of a life that's totally catered to your needs as someone seeking personal growth, without requiring you to leave home or family. It's designed for the challenges and diversity of lay life. Simply put, living in a mountain meditating in a cave is not congruent with most of our circumstances these days, but that does not mean we cannot have access to our own inner riches and resources. One Prayer allows you to go deep within yourself but in a sustainable way. You start with the resources and time you have. The One Prayer System was created by my own teacher, Master Sang Kim, a Tai Chi Master and lineage holder in both the Taoist and Christian traditions. Master Kim comes from Korea and has inherited traditional cultivation systems that have been passed down from generation to generation, but he is also a modern person who has lived in the west and trained as an engineer, has a family, and worked in the corporate world. Purpose in the One Prayer is something that you discover in the details of life. Purpose is what gives you energy, feeds you emotionally, and inspires you. You identify those areas where you feel that already, even if it's a small pocket of your life, or a vision of what it could be, and you give it attention, nurturing it like a seed. The foundation of the One Prayer System is the concept of cultivation. Cultivation is not fixing what's wrong with you, but learning how to use how you're made, as a uniquely designed person, with awareness. Cultivation is not just a concept for a specific discipline like martial arts or a spiritual practice, but how you relate to yourself as a whole person. It is about taking our hard wiring, our patterns and our practices, and embracing the truths they teach as a way of nourishing our whole being. We are always cultivating something, because whatever we do accumulates to a certain outcome. The question is not whether you're cultivating but, do you like the direction of your cultivation? Are you cultivating in the area of your purpose? If so, you will feel more energy, more fulfillment, and more clarity. I started studying with Master Kim because I loved how much he loved his life! Since I have known him, he has always had this energy of being genuinely happy and also full of purpose and fun. He works extremely hard, but never seems burdened by it. The kind of attention he has for a person makes you feel really special, because he's put that kind of attention into himself. He has cultivated deep presence and self-understanding, and that carries over into all of his relationships. I was attracted to his example of how to live with freedom and ease, how he knew where to put his effort and attention in a way that was effective and added up over time. And what's more, he was having a great time in the process, not sacrificing in order to get there. That's what I wanted. Fortunately, these days there are many systems for identifying purpose and areas of strength or opportunities for growth in our careers or personal lives. Purpose in the One Prayer is something that you discover in the details of life. Purpose is what gives you energy, feeds you emotionally, and inspires you.Cultivation is not fixing what's wrong with you, but learning how to use how you're made, as a uniquely designed person, with awareness. The One Prayer is a tool designed to give everyone that freedom. It's one giant feedback system toward your purpose. It is a system of tools to organize your life around self-mastery. And this whole system updates with you in real time as you grow. The system starts with a map where you take a full inventory of yourself. Most of us are familiar with ourselves in the parts where we're developed, and then we have blind spots, or parts we're not as aware of. Ironically, our blind spots can often be the areas we're strong in, and are so fundamental to how we operate that we don't even see what we're doing. In my case, I didn't realize how fundamental it was to seek connection. When you're triggered by something and it's bothering you, this is when the One Prayer kicks in. You have a reference list that is a summary of the latest things you are working on. You have a whole inventory of yourself that gives you perspective on who you are. You have a journal where you track your victories and get a reminder of who you've been and who you are becoming. You start to understand the problem from the perspective of growth and not as a failure. If none of that works, you have a section where you deep dive into the problem until you understand what perspective you were missing. When you have this way of working deeply with yourself, you feel like your own best friend. When you have this way of working deeply with yourself, you feel like your own best friend . This process was really eye opening for me. The One Prayer helped me identify how my purpose was hidden in pain. I used to think of myself as a plant person. I'd spend up to 20 hours a week in my garden and I thought that I wanted to design spaces that invited people to have a transformative experience. I was pursuing things like garden design, and I went to a permaculture workshop. I thought I liked sustainability and design, but what I realized through the SUN SHEN One Prayer System was that I was in a tremendous amount of social pain. I was all bent out of shape because I had no idea how to interact socially and I felt like an idiot. My emotions were telling me I lacked some skills I never even knew I needed. I realized I had been hiding behind garden design and behind working with plants because they were safer than people, but what I really wanted was a more direct way to impact and work with people. Because of my lack of skills to relate to people \u2014 communication skills, not taking things personally, navigating conflict \u2014 I was stunted in that area. Once I saw this pain clearly, I was able to look at how to develop these skills. What I did externally didn't change, but how I used what I was doing in my life changed. I ran events at SUN SHEN to see how I could better work with people. I designed to see how I could integrate other people's ideas into designs. I worked with people individually to understand different perspectives and remove my own blind spots. I continued to work with my Feldenkrais clients and healing clients to improve my interpersonal skills. Because SUN SHEN is a school of cultivation, everything is seen from a place of growth. The premise is we're all cultivating something, we're all doing things every day that add up to a certain result. For instance, if we slouch, then we cultivate having a slouched posture; if we keep standing straight, then we get better and better at having a straighter posture. The question is, do we like what we are cultivating, the direction and the result we're getting? As a disciple, you're expected to teach what you learn, and you learn by teaching. So I began working with people individually on their One Prayer. While I was cultivating my own growth, I was also cultivating the skills to help others. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2018 Page 103 The One Prayer System has three parts: a detailed map of yourself, including your vision for what you want your life to look like, emotions you seek, and how you naturally take action; emotional processing tools; and tracking of daily practices and strategies for how you want to grow into this purpose. When you put the parts together, it becomes a giant feedback loop to help you understand yourself. Imagine you knew what kind of emotions you like to experience, and could set up your whole life around experiencing them. Imagine you knew what kind of activities give you energy and could distill the elements of those experiences. Imagine your whole life was set up around this awareness, where all day long you're feeling ease, feeling meaning, feeling purpose \u2014 where if you have pain, the pain gives you direct feedback about your purpose and how to hone it further. Now imagine you had a group of people who are doing this all together, encouraging each other and supporting each other, adding that structure and validation for one another and having a guide to help you all through the process, someone who's been through it and can relate to the fears and challenges and who has a really good handle on all the tools. It makes for great bonding and really rapid growth. The ONE PRAYER Journaling System is the branch of the SUN SHEN System that allows a person to understand themselves deeply, so that their life works the way they want it to work. It's a tool to bring together everything they're working on under one umbrella, and can be used by anyone. Whatever your path or calling, the One Prayer is a way to make that calling more clear, more doable. When I started my studies with Master Kim he had us journal every day. We started where there was already energy, explored the area of our interests and dreams. It gave me a way to center my life and make sense of the transition I was in. I was a new mom, felt depleted, and had set my career and external role aside. Even though I was developing in the areas of healing and studying the System, I wasn't very inspired or confident at the time. I was used to having a strong professional identity, used to feeling capable. And here I was, very much a beginner in this new territory. I was attracted to his example of how to live with freedom and ease, how he knew where to put his effort and attention in a way that was effective and added up over time. About three years after meeting Master Kim, I was invited to join a small group of people who were becoming his disciples, to learn the whole SUN SHEN System in a dedicated way. This is a serious undertaking, because it's a complete Tai Chi lineage, the journaling and self-understanding part of the system, and studying the Scriptures. It is a set of integrated tools based on Christianity, Taoism, and the modern scientific view. All with the goal of maximizing a life geared toward my purpose. I met my fellow disciples before we started our formal discipleship training. My husband had been a student of Master Kim's for several years and had already learned the Tai Chi forms and was instructing in the class. He was a shy, techy guy from Taiwan, very physically gifted and enthusiastic about Tai Chi. Another close colleague, Alexis Neuhaus, had come to Master Kim with some life-threatening health challenges and was getting support from him. He had come to Ann Arbor to get work from some gifted healers and was gradually turning around. He was extremely bright and intellectual, had gone to Princeton. Soon after he started getting support, Master Kim discovered Alexis had a talent for organizational direction, and he was put in charge of the business aspect. He came from a Buddhist background and was familiar with how to transmit a lineage and the kind of agreements and conditions that are necessary for that. He is actually responsible for us setting up the discipleship in the way it is. The three of us continue to work closely and mentor the newer disciples who joined later (there are now 26). Because we had such a tight structure, and boundaries on our time together, we had a lot of safety. What that meant practically is we could go really deep and be vulnerable. I remember going through our visions for our lives together and reading them out loud, processing through really tough things. The One Prayer allows you to get to the cutting edge of where you are growing as a person, meaning your identity keeps updating and becoming closer to the real you. We had each other to witness and reinforce each breakthrough. Ironically, our blind spots can often be the areas we're strong in, and are so fundamental to how we operate that we don't even see what we're doing. Once I saw this pain clearly, I was able to look at how to develop these skills. What I did externally didn't change, but how I used what I was doing in my life changed.My deeper need for connection was too vulnerable for me to access until I started working on the One Prayer. My whole life I'd been skirting around this need, thinking I was an introvert. If I didn't have the One Prayer System I would have probably done what I'd done half a dozen other times in my adult life, and started off in a different area without addressing the underlying need. My own career has included being a professional musician, teaching movement, and pursuing design. I literally had no idea that the underlying drive, and the thing that ties them all together, is the desire to connect deeply with people. Without this I'd be chasing after empty skill sets, none of which hit my purpose, or hit it so haphazardly that I'd give up. I was focusing on performance but I ended up developing skills that made me feel capable. But I was still missing the skills that would help me actually navigate through close relationships: facing conflict, apology, and repair. I learned that we all have these areas, these developmental \"holes.\" It's really tricky to be able to hack into them and satisfy the needs hidden inside them, but when you do a whole new world opens up. You transcend the problems you had before. When teaching the One Prayer System, I love when people discover a need that they didn't even know was there, the more fundamental need than what seems apparent on the surface, the need that is hidden from our own awareness because it's so vulnerable. I love when it becomes safe enough to stumble upon this need, because discovering our real needs is a place of invention and agency. In my case, with developing social skills, I was able to break it down into small pieces and set up ways to track it, journal about what my subjective experience was, and get the feedback I needed. I get support from my teacher. I get encouragement and examples from other students who were working in their own \"holes.\" The One Prayer brings together many necessary experiences in the whole vast project and everything else that is happening in my life. As a bonus, I now really like my relationships. I love bringing people into the place where they can safely explore their purpose from a place of creativity and self-acceptance with this most amazing set of tools. I love seeing them able to do things they've never been able to do before, and bringing the kind of attention to their lives in the places that need it the most. I love bringing people into the place where they can safely explore their purpose from a place of creativity and self-acceptance with this most amazing set of tools.My whole life I'd been skirting around this need, thinking I was an introvert.

What lasting upgrade would you like to make in your health, finances, or relationships? Beneath every problem are beliefs, feelings, and often-traumatic responses with which we resonate unconsciously. When we resonate with what is positive, we spiral up; we're able to access opportunities for change in a creative and self-empowered way. We feel confident in our capacity to handle what life brings us with clear thinking and an open heart. Basically, our system is energized by these positive beliefs and feelings. However, much of the pain and limitation that we experience in the present is created when our system instead is in sync with old, life-depleting beliefs instead of positive beliefs. These outdated patterns are linked with highly charged feelings, and easily re-triggered even in completely unrelated circumstances. Essentially, our system is stuck being energized by these depleting beliefs and feelings, and de-energized by the positive ones! For example, resonating with \"I never get what I want in life!\" instead of resonating with \"Life flows and my needs are easily met.\"There is an extraordinary approach that simply, swiftly, and literally changes our resonance. While we can't change our past, we can, even in a single session, change its frequency within us. This profoundly shifts our experience of the world, and our ability to live an empowered life.This healing system is called Resonance Repatterning, and at its foundation is that all matter is vibrating with energy. This includes our entire body, right down to individual cells and atoms, as well as our thoughts, feelings, and spoken words. This vibration generates a frequency, which is unique to each activity or emotion, and is a largely unconscious phenomenon that determines what sort of life experiences we have. When the optimal frequency pulsation is lost, we may find ourselves unconsciously resonating with poor health, unhappy relationships, or limitation in any sphere of our lives. The ancient principles of repatterning have been taught for thousands of years and are now being validated through scientific research in quantum physics. Chloe Faith Wordsworth, an acupuncturist, developed the process that identifies and shifts blocked energy in the body-mind system. She worked with heroin addicts who were continually self-sabotaging and re-abusing, even when all the physical and emotional support elements were in place, and knew there had to be a way to identify and heal the true underlying issues. Chloe is a passionate student of natural health, and her extensive knowledge of meridians, sound frequencies, holograms, psychology, physics, and more, provided the background to synthesize this new and dynamic system of energy work. Resonance Repatterning unites all of these insights into a system that allows us to easily identify and transform the exact life-depleting beliefs, feelings, and unconscious patterns that underlie problems we are facing in the present. Beneath every problem are beliefs, feelings, and often-traumatic responses with which we resonate unconsciously. Spiraling Up!

Teachers, Lecturers, Workshop Leaders, and The CentersOne client's story: In over 25 years of work as a practitioner, I've found repatterning to be safe and effective in a wide range of circumstances, including for groups or businesses, by parents for their children, for pets, and over the phone sessions.

Pleasant in the Holistic Doula program. She also consults on Natural Family Health and Maternity care in Ann Arbor.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2019 Page 115 My own experience with Repatterning began in 1990 when I was a recent college graduate. Diagnosed with debilitating posttraumatic stress (PTSD), the State of Michigan considered it so severe that they declared me permanently disabled and waived all my student loans. It was two years into this challenging and rather desperate situation that I met Chloe Wordsworth and Resonance Repatterning (formerly called Holographic Repatterning.) It made sense to me that our subconscious patterns, imprinted at the earliest times of our lifetime, are held as frequencies within us. These memories from our conception, prenatal life, birth, and early years settle into our intrinsic memory bank, forming the foundation of our beliefs, feelings, and responses to life. For instance, it's common for the ultra-aware senses of the unborn and newly born babies to be callously dismissed, and for patterns of unmet needs to be passed on generationally. Such formative influences continually operate in the background of our present day lives, greatly (but invisibly) affecting our behavior and habits. After about two months and a half dozen sessions, I found myself capably reuniting with my family, joyously making plans for the future, and successfully stepping out of my housebound cocoon into a high-intensity, national sales position that involved travel. Repatterning now includes over 100 processes to transform painful areas in your life with thousands of variations, an extensive book of modalities, and remarkable stories of change. Using muscle checking, Resonance Repatterning identifies the patterns of non- coherence and directs the practitioner to those modalities that provide the exact frequencies that your system needs in order to bring it into coherence, harmony, and balance. A session is generally 45-60 minutes, where a themed conversation helps identify beliefs and feelings that may be playing an underlying role. After identifying the modality to shift the frequencies, such as a specific sound, movement, or breath, the statements are then rechecked to confirm their shift, and the session is complete. Most people feel relaxed and energized after a session.\"I was always reacting to everything around me\u2014there would be a new issue, but it was the same old patterns. I was tense all the time, and sick of it! My chronic back pain had gotten to be just too much. One of my other health care providers suggested I see Beth, and I've had maybe six or eight Repattenings in the last year.There have been big changes; I am different now in a very good way. I stand up for myself, and seem to be able to shift dynamics without being drawn into the family drama. I can even walk away, breathe, and take care of myself! It's a really big deal that I just don't even get involved. I think it was because I was so tense, protecting myself from whatever, that I had the back pain. I'm not completely out of this pattern yet, but my body is different now. Since we put the tuning fork on my back, there has been zero pain. Usually my back would get tense and twitch, and now that is almost completely gone.I feel more in control of my life, and I am not so worried about what will be thrown at me next. For instance, it's been a HUGE turning point to be able to find the words for what I want, and be able to say them. Now, overall, when I am just walking through daily life, I am more cognizant of being tense and can take that step back. We've broken the cycle of tenseness, and that stressful way of life. My mind is calming down, I'm much more relaxed. There has been a positive impact on my family, (my children) are relaxing too. Because my anxiety isn't kicking in, they can sit in the same room with me open and relaxed. They are able to talk with me now, and feel safe having their own rough thoughts and speaking about themselves without shutting down. It's crazy how it's all connected.\" This vibration generates a frequency, which is unique to each activit y or emotion, and is a largely unconscious phenomenon that determines what sort of life experiences we have.
