Regardless of the absolute number, the vast ma- jority of these microorganisms live in the gut (micro- biota),5where they perform functions that are essential to our health and survival. They help us digest food6; participate in the activation of certain drugs7; produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that help modulate gene expression by inhibiting deacetylation of histone proteins8-10; generate molecules that reduce inflamma- tion11; and play a fundamental role in the induction, basic development, training, and function of our im-mune system. 12-14Thus, as a whole, the microbiome be- comes an integral part of our immune makeup, and is largely inherited from the mother with signicant differ- ences consequent to cesarean versus vaginal deliver- ies.15-20Among the many roles the microbiome may ultimately play in health and disease, it mitigates against the untoward effects from our exposure to the environ- ment by residing as a biotic barrier between us and the world around us.1,21-25 Neuropsychiatric disorders26are on the increase glob- ally and, of the noncommunicable diseases, stand out as a leading cause of disability.3,8,27,28Accruing evidence strongly links gut dysbiosis (gut microbiota-host malad- aptation) as a risk factor in a wide range of mental ill- nesses that include neuropsychiatric conditions,3,29-38 such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD)39-46and schizophrenia39,40,46-49among them. There are cur- rently no drugs approved that treat the core symptoms of ASD.50The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia, a debilitating mental disorder, are un-known 51and drug therapies used to treat the associ- ated psychotic symptoms have advanced little since the introduction of clozapine in 1960.52,53 The reported association of mental illness with diges- tive disturbances dates back to Hippocrates and stands as the single consistently linke d comorbidity described in the medical literature from ancient times to the present.49 Although the genesis of our microbiome is predomi-nantly our mother's, 18,54eventually our microbiome transforms into our own unique signature.55Changes in the gut microbial composition and function constantly adapt to our diet,56,57and the mechanistic relationshipsbetween the gut microbiota in the development of the en- teric nervous system58and the preservation of our meta- bolic health59,60are only now beginning to be elucidated. Microbiota-Induced Epigenetics Advances in genetic editing technologies may help clar-ify whether it is our genetics that control our epigenomeor epigenetics that control the genome\u2014or, more likely, the relationship between the two is mutual. 61There is supporting evidence to suggest that our microbiome plays a fundamental role in this relationship.14,62,63 Numerous studies64,65show microbe-generated metabo- lites are intertwined with host cell biochemistry and physiology, and SCFA-mediated cell signaling is a key pathway that gut microbes use to communicate with the host.9,44,66-68Acetate, propionate (propionic acid is also commonly referred to as PPA), butyrate, and penta- noate, having respectively, 2, 3, 4, and 5 carbon atoms are SCFAs (Table 1), largely produced by microbial fer- mentation of complex polysaccharides (starches and - bers) in the colon (longer chain aliphatic acids with 6 to 12 carbons are considered to be medium-chain fatty acids [MCFAs]). SCFAs are absorbed into the colonic epithelium where, primarily, butyrate is consumed as a preferred fuel source by colonocytes.69-73Microbiota- produced SCFAs enter the bloodstream through the por- tal circulation of the host and/or the distal colon and aretransported to recipient tissues where they are taken up and used in a variety of cellular responses, including the regulation of gene expression. 9,47,74,75 Many brain disorders are associated with imbalances in protein acetylation levels and transcriptional dys- function.76Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors represent a promising therapeutic option to correct these deciencies, and numerous studies using buty- rate, the most potent of the SCFA HDAC inhibitors,9,77 Table 1.

Ket-amine is a glutamatergic N-methyl- D-aspartate receptor antagonist that can induce psychotomimetic, perceptual, cognitive, and neuroendocrine responses in humans and in rodent models of schizophrenia.106,107ALA also inhibits nuclear factor kappa-B of its antioxidant function. NF- jB belongs to an important group of transcription factors regulated by a kinase-mediated signaling pathway that transduces signals from the cell surface to changes in gene expression.108,109 Fatty acids represent one of the body's long-term stor- age reservoirs and sources of fuel energy\u2014the heart being ap r i m a r yc o n s u m e r .110In the presence of respiratory ox- ygen, fatty acids are shuttled through the mitochondrial OXPHOS complex system, where they are degraded by two carbon units at a time to shorter-chain fatty acids (and ultimately to acetyl coenzyme A), with concomitant release of water, CO 2, and ATP in the process. The cellu- lar availability of SCFAs for u se in epigenetic chromatin remodeling through their ab ility to inhibit HDAC activ- ity, therefore, is closely tied to mitochondrial energy pro- duction and metabolism. S ince both prokaryote and eukaryote cells share common pathways for energy pro- duction, for example, the citric acid cycle,75it comes as no surprise that gut microbi ota inexorably affect host- cell bioenergetics, which in turn fuels gene expression in the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes.75,111Over a billion years of evolutionary history have allowed our mi- tochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA to co- evolve with a high degree of genetic compatibility.112,113 Interestingly, our micro biome and our mitogenome (mtDNA), as well as portions of our epigenome\u2014for ex- ample, maternal silencing,114are uniquely passed to each of us from our mother. Gut microbiota have a profound influence on the host immune system.13Maternal immune activation is a shared environmental risk factor for a plethora of neu- ropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders that may or may not develop into clinical symptoms in off- spring.13Evidence from an in-depth study115of data extracted from the Danish health registry of more than 1 million children born between 1980 and 2005, fo- cusing on cases where the mother had a viral infection with fever requiring hospitalization during the rst tri- mester, strongly links maternal immune dysregulation with suppressed neurodevelopment and cognitive func- tion (ASD) in their offspring.116In other epidemiologi- cal studies,117prenatal exposure to infection visibly stands out as a risk factor in schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental abnormalities. The possibility that prenatal Zika virus infection from a mosquito reservoiris responsible for the current outbreak in Brazil of chil- dren born with microcephaly is a disturbing and fright- ening example. 118-121 FIG. 1. Chemical structure of R-(+)-lipoic acid.Moos, et al .;BioResearch Open Access 2016, 5.1 http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/biores.2016.0010139Synthetic Biology With a capacity to act either naturally or by manipula- tion, the gut microbial ecosystem is an indispensable and constituent player in the maintenance of our well- being.7Thus, in treating disease, adjusting the functional composition of the gut microbiome may help facilitate and even alter the outcome of therapeutic interven-tions. 122,123Dietary sources of probiotics such as, for ex- ample, in traditional Greek yogurt, have been used since antiquity in the Mediterranean region (Mediterranean diet)124,125to maintain a state of wellness. However, once pathogenic dysbiosis sets in, probiotics have not proven to be remedial123,126,127and other inter- ventional methods are being investigated. In this ef- fort, independent work from several groups suggests that (engineered) bacteria have potential to be an ef- fective means for delivering, enhancing, or themselves acting as therapeutic agents (''living pills'')128to treat certain diseases,22,129-132including psychiatric disor- ders,43,48,133-136and signicant investments are being made to adapt a variety of co mmensal microbial species for remodeling the gut microbiota (ecobiotics) in disease- treating indications.133,137-139A similar approach aims to utilize engineered viruses to seek and selectively destroy pathogenic bacteria.140-142Drawing conclusions from a study of 11 children affected by ASD that showed im- provement in communication and behavioral tests afterbeing treated with vancomycin for 8 weeks, Mangiola et al. 46speculate that modulation of gut microbiota through antibiotic treatment may influence the symp- toms and expression of psychiatric disorders in general. Devkota143takes this further by underscoring a com- prehensive need for more investigations into drug- microbiome interactions and the mechanisms that are involved therein. Interestingly, during long stays in space, the cong- uration of the gut microbiome of astronauts is often signicantly transformed relative to the one they hadon Earth. 144-146The ongoing NASA Twins Study, with Scott Kelly having recently returned from a his- toric 340-day mission aboard the International Space Station, may shine additional light on this subject.147 Gut microbial dysregulation can alter one's immunestatus and cause aberrant social and cognitive behav- ior. 35,148,149This may result in catastrophic conse- quences during long space flights, as for example, to Mars, if an astronaut's ability to carry out demandingtasks at a high performance and optimal level becomes severely compromised. 150History shows that address- ing the technological challenges space explorationpresents has a constructive rippling effect on the tech- nological advances made for a wide range of applica- tions here on Earth. Synthetic biology151has potential to deliver robust and reliable organisms that can assist on long-duration astronaut missions.152It is antici- pated that the techniques required to be developed may also be applied to engineer phage and bacteriato explore and to therapeutically modify the gut micro- biome as needed. 153 Brain Development and Neurological Disorders Aging is a leading risk factor (Fig. 2)154in progressing to dementia.155-159Although the latest studies suggest that the prevalence of dementia may be leveling off and even decreasing in some subsets of the population,160for the foreseeable future, dementia will continue to be a majorchallenge for the healthcare establishment. 161 The gut's evolving capacity to adapt and maintain normal microbiota, which begins at birth and contin- ues throughout one's life, is necessary to support the metabolic activities of the brain.59,162This is especially so in the early childhood years through adulthood.59 Studies have shown that some of the typical behavioraland physiological abnormalities associated with neuro- developmental disorders, including autism 43-45,163-165 and schizophrenia,40,47-49can be butyrate comprise the ma- jority SCFAs produced in the gut by microbial fer- mentation.21,69Propionate and butyrate can modulate brain functioning, principally appetite and energy ho- meostasis, through regulation of neuropeptide produc- tion.167Butyrate is mostly absorbed by the colonic epithelium, whereas acetate and propionate are passed into the portal circulation.168-170In gut dysbiosis, the constitutional spectrum of SCFAs varies substantiallyfrom the host's natural healthy balance, 3,32,39,60,171 and higher than normal levels of PPA have been linkedto deleterious effects on brain function 43,75,78,172-179in autistic children.24,174Given these ndings, and the fact that PPA is widely used as a food preservative,180there may be cause for some concern. Idiopathic late-onset dementia (ILOD) is character- ized by a series of declining daily functional compe- tences, most often involving memory, reasoning, and sociobehavioral abilities, in the elderly.157,161Dementia encompasses a myriad of clinical symptoms typically as-sociated with discrete neurological disorders such as Alz- heimer and Parkinson diseases, hippocampal sclerosis of aging, and Lewy body and frontotemporal dementiasMoos, et al .;BioResearch Open Access 2016, 5.1 http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/biores.2016.0010140being the more notable ones, but not collectively mani- fested by any one of them. Cellular processes depend on the energy supplied by their mitochondria, and dysfunctional mitochondria can lead to an unsustain- able cellular bioenergetics decit that is detrimental tothe cell's function and survival. 181In brain cells, even a small energy decit, which is a common occurrence during the aging process, can reduce synaptic neuro- transmitter release and adversely affect synaptic func- tion.26,101Maintaining a healthy gut microbiota state is necessary to support the metabolic activities of the brain,59,162and Mattson157and Bourassa et al.85posit that some of the common pathologies leading to ILOD and other brain disorders may be amenable to therapeu-tic modication by diet and lifestyle changes. For exam- ple, exercise, yoga, and meditation are lifestyle activities known to improve brain blood flow\u2014which, presum- ably, can enhance perfusion of the brain with micronu- trients absorbed by the gut 182\u2014and are increasingly being incorporated in treatments for depression and other mental disturbances.36,127,183-185 At the other end of the age spectrum, the correla- tion between impaired intellectual development and a prolonged state of malnutrition in infants and young children is inescapable.186-189Recent studies have demonstrated that the normal pattern of gut microbiota assembly is disrupted in malnourished children.162,187To maximize the therapeutic benetof diet and dietary supplements, preclinical evidence suggests that a healthy microbiome in these children may need to be congured as well.190,191 Concluding Remarks The importance of physical activity coupled with a bal- anced and healthy diet in the maintenance of our well- being has been recognized since antiquity. However, it is only recently that characterization of the host- microbiome intermetabolic and crosstalk pathways has come to the forefront for study in therapeutic de- sign and treatments.68,192As reviewed in this report, synthetic biology has potential to develop microorgan- isms for correcting pathogenic dysbiosis, but this hasyet to be proven. (For additional examples of the latest approaches to manipulating the microbiota, including illustrative gures, see Ash and Mueller, 193and articles cited therein.) In contrast, the development and use of small molecule drugs have a long and successful his- tory in the clinical treatment of diseases. Small mole- cule HDAC inhibitors are already used in the clinic to treat cancer and hematological disorders,77and preclinical research with SCFA HDAC inhibitors demonstrates conditions.26,101Epigenetic reg- ulation of host-microbiota interactions by utilizing epigenomic-targeting drugs has been suggested by Alenghat and Artis.74 FIG. 2.

Salivanomics is a rapidly emerging tool in the arsenal of salivary diagnostics.194Collecting saliva or swabbing the inside cheek of the mouth is noninterven- tional, making it a highly attractive diagnostic proce-dure, particularly for infants and young children. It is not unlikely that regular visits to your dentist may soon be as important to your gut as it is to your oral hygiene, white teeth, and a nice smile.
