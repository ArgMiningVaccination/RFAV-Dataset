Burden of epilepsy Epilepsy is a neurological disorder, characte rized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. A seizure is the result of sudden, usually brief, excessive electrical disc harges in a group of nerve cells in the brain. Different parts of th e brain can be the site of such discharges. Clinical manifestations of seizures will, theref ore, vary depending on where in the brain the disturbance first starts and how far it spre ads. Transient symptoms, such as loss of awareness or consciousness and disturbances of movement, sensation, mood or mental function can occur. Two major categories of seizure can be distinguished: generalized seizures (electrical discharge involves the whole brain) and partial seizures (electrical discharge involves one or more localized areas of the brain).1 In the Netherlands, approximately 120,000 people are currently su ffering from epilepsy; the incidence is estimated at 30 per 100,000 people, meaning there are 5,000 to 8,000 newly identified cases per year.2 In 2015, based on the Netherlands Inst itute for Health Services Research (NIVEL) Primary Care Database, the prevalence of epilepsy in the Netherlands was even estimated to be 180,000 with an incidence of 14,600 new cases.3 Epilepsy has a large impact on patients' quality of life,4,5 their surroundings and society as a whole.6,7 A study which examined DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) suggested that globally, around 1% of the number of days lost due to ill health may be due to epilepsy.8 The same study estimated that the aggreg ate burden due to epilepsy is around 0.5% of the total disease burden.8 This condition also has a considerable effect on the patient's psychological and emotional state. In the Netherlands, children with epilepsy seem to have poorer school attendance and performance.9 Moreover, adults with epilepsy are twice as likely to self-report depression or anxiety. Adults with active epilepsy were 3 times as likely to self-report depression and twice as likely to have anxiety compared to adults without epilepsy.10 It has been argued that depre ssion affects 20-50% of individuals with epilepsy.11 Lastly, it has been estimated that up to 50% of epilepsy cases have cognitive impairments that affect he alth, productivity and quality of life.12 1.1 Clinical trajectory In current practice, there is still a consider able need for improvem ent of the diagnosis, classification, treatment and ma nagement of epilepsy. For example, diagnosing epilepsy is a lengthy process that can be a burden for th e patient and weighs (financially) heavily on the health system (health insurance), while misdiagnoses are quite common. As seizures are infrequent events in the majority of patie nts, recording of ictal (e.g. during seizures) EEG is both time-consuming and expensive. Th e mainstay of diagnosis , therefore, remains the detection of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs).13 IEDs in the electroencephalograph are used to confirm the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy and to classify the epilepsy syndrome in patients.14 About 30% of the patients with epilepsy are not seizure-free while on anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). These patients, with uncontrolled epileptic seizures and in whom two or more Chapter 1 12 AEDs have failed, are commonly referred to as having refractory or intractable epilepsy. Patients with intractable epilepsy, depending on their preferences an d comorbidities, may be eligible for several other treatments su ch as vagus nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation, the ketogenic diet and surgery de pending on the type an d localization of the epilepsy. 1.2 Economic impact Although the impact of interventio ns on population health is vital, it is also important to determine the role of different interventions in contributing to other socially desirable goals, such as improving patients' quality of life and reducing societal costs. Societal costs include healthcare and other (inter-sectoral) costs such as productivity losses. In addition, due to scarcity of resources and rising costs in the Dutch healthcare system , economic evaluations are becoming more important for decisi on-makers and health care reimbursement companies. In 2011, in The Neth erlands, costs of epilepsy were about 248.7 million euro, that is 4.8% of the total healthcare costs spent on neurological conditions.15 This is comparable to the cost of epil epsy in other western countries.6,7 Furthermore, healthcare costs attributable to epilepsy are rising, especi ally in the past decades, which highlights the need for an efficient allocation of resources (see Figure 1.1). The costs presented in Figure 1.1 reflect hea lthcare costs, which only represent a small part of the costs attributable to epilepsy. For example, various studies have found that the unemployment rate among epileptic patients is at least twice as high as in the general population; when epileptic patients do find a jo b, they find it difficult to hold onto it, leading to even higher rates of unemployment.16-18 In addition, living with epilepsy may lead to dependency on others (e.g . for transport or housekeeping).

The field of health te chnology assessment (HTA) Health technology assessment is a broad mul tidisciplinary field which examines the social, economic, organizational and ethical issues of a health intervention or health technology.19 HTA aims to provide policymakers an d practitioners with evidence-based choices in health services and patient care. Th is thesis will focus on two disciplines in particular, namely research into patient preferences and econ omic evaluations. 2.1 Patient preferences In HTA, patient preferences form an important factor in determ ining the overall quality of a (new) treatment or clinical to ol. Eliciting preferences has beco me increasingly important in healthcare20; understanding them can be very useful for both policy and clinical decisions. Over the years, weighing the patient's op inion in these decisions has become more evident2; incorporating them in clin ical decisions might also lead to improved adherence and outcomes.21 The most common way to measure prefer ences in healthcare is by stated preference (SP) methods, which involve th e elicitation of responses to predefined alternatives, people hypothetically stating their preference. This is in contrast to revealed preference methods which involve observin g preferences in real life. Three broad categories of SP methods have been distin guished: ranking, ratings and choice-based approaches.22 In ranking exercises, respondents w ill be given a pre-specified number of alternatives which they will be asked to rank fr om 'most preferable' to 'least preferable'. In rating scale exercises, respondents are usually asked to rate each alternative on a Likert scale with a pre-specified range (i.e. 1 to 7). The third category is a choice-based approach, for example a discrete choice experime nt (DCE), involving the presentation of a series of pairwise choice tasks involving hypo thetical scenarios, in which respondents are asked to select their preferred scenario. Anot her type of choice-based approach, namely best-worst scaling (BWS), is becoming increasingly popular.23 BWS devised by Finn and Louviere (1992)24 and formally introduced to hea lthcare research by McIntosh and Louviere (2002),25 is a novel method in which responde nts are asked to indicate the best and the worst in a set of available items or options.

Chapter 1 14 Preference studies are also used to determin e the value people attach to certain health states. In health economics, the value of a health state (often referred to as a utility) is used to calculate quality adjusted life years (QAL Ys). A utility can be seen as measure which states the value of a particular health state. U tilities are expressed on a scale from 0 to 1, in which 0 means \"worst imaginable health stat e\" and 1 means \"perfect health\". Next, utilities are used to calculate quality adjusted life years (QALYs), by multiplying the utility of a health state by the time spent in that parti cular health state. For example, if someone would live 5 years longer with a utility of 0. 8, then this person gains 4 QALYs (5*0.8=4). Utilities can be determined in many ways but, if all else is equal, most health economists prefer choice-based methods to rating methods, as choosing , unlike rating, is a (more) natural human task at which we all have co nsiderable experience; furthermore, it is observable and verifiable.27 As mentioned above, utilities are determined (or measured) for specific health states. Hence, if one knows the health state of a pat ient, one can easily calculate QALYs. Quality of life instruments, such as the EuroQol- 5 dimensions-5 levels (EQ-5D-5L) or the ShortForm-36, are questionnaires which try to identify the health state (and hence quality of life) of patients by asking pre-specif ied questions with pre-specified response alternatives. For example, the EuroQol 5 Dimens ions with 5 levels (EQ-5D-5L), consists of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression, and comprises 5 levels (ranging from no problems to extreme problems). Thus, a total of 3125 possible he alth states can be composed. If one knows the utilities associated with each health state, it is easy to determine respondents' utility by looking at their answers. The set of utilities corresponding to health states is often referred to as a valuation set. This is where preferences studies come in. In most cases, the general population is asked to put a utility value on each health state, often in an indirect manner. One way of doing this is to use the time-trade-off method (T TO), which is a choice-based preference approach. People are asked how many healthy years they are willing to give up in order to become indifferent between the specific disease state and the remaining years of life in perfect health. For example, if a person is told to live 10 years in health state A, and indicates that he or she is willing to give up 2 years of those 10 years to be in perfect health (i.e. 8 perfect ye ars instead of 10 years in heal th state A), the corresponding utility for that health state is (10-2)/10= 0.80 . By repeating this exercise for every health state and with a large enough samp le, the valuation set is obtained. Although patients' quality of life or utility is assessed by use of instruments such as the EQ-5D-5L, it is important to note that the genera l population is used to derive utility values, not the patients, the main reason being that it is often assumed that the use of patients' preferences may lead to underestimation due to adaptation to their health state. The general population is assumed to be best able to discriminate between diseases and conditions. General introduction to the thesis 15 1 2.2 Economic evaluations In an economic evaluation (EE), one compares both the costs and effects of two (or more) alternative treatments or inte rventions in a systematic manner. Hence, it is possible to examine which alternative is most efficient. On the whole, there are two forms of EE: 1) an EE piggy-backed to a randomized controlled trial in which all costs and effects are measured (prospectively) during the trial peri od, a so-called trial-based EE, and 2) an EE based on previously published literature synt hesized in a decision model, a so-called model-based EE. Model-based EE are ge nerally used to examine long-term consequences, whereas trial-based EE ar e often used for short-term goals. 2.2.1 Outcome measures The most common types of econ omic evaluations are the cost -effectiveness analysis (CEA) and the cost-utility analysis (CUA). A CEA is an economic evaluation in which the outcomes are expressed in natural units, such as se izure frequency or seizure severity. Hence, outcomes are often assessed with instruments us ed in clinical practice (e.g. blood pressure monitoring or EEG registration). In a CUA, the outcomes are ex pressed in terms of quality of life. Quality of life is referred to as an individual 's well-being including more subjective domains such as psychological and social state and not mere ly the absence of disease. As mentioned above, Quality of life is usually expressed in term s of utilities, which in turn can be used to calculate QALYs. Often a distinction is made between diseas e-specific quality of life instruments, designed to be relevant to a particular co ndition or state, in this case epilepsy,28 and generic quality of life instruments. The latte r are designed to be applicable across all diseases or conditions, across different medi cal interventions and across a wide range of populations. In epilepsy, an often used disease-specific qua lity of life instrument is the Quality of Life in people living with epilepsy (QOLIE-31p).29 An example of a generic quality of life instrument is the EQ-5D-5L or the SF-36. Ge neric QALYs can be particularly useful for decision-makers as most instruments used to me asure utilities are designed to be applicable in a large variety of conditions (generic qua lity of life instruments). Hence these outcomes can be used for reimbursement or policy decisions when deciding between several competing treatments covering a range of conditions. 2.2.2 Categorization of costs To present all relevant and identified costs in an economic evaluation, the following categorization is often used27: Healthcare costs: these include treatment costs and all other medical costs incurred during the study follow-up, such as preven tion, diagnostics, therapy and rehabilitation costs. Chapter 1 16 Patient & family costs: these are all servic es paid by the patient, e.g. time invested, informal care and travel expenses. Productivity costs: costs caused by the (t emporary) inability to perform professional activities or due to reduced productivity. Other costs: all costs in other (inter-sectora l) sectors, such as special education or housing adjustments (see Drost et al. 201430). Resource use is often measured by costs di aries or retrospective costs questionnaires. Questionnaires or diaries are especially important for measuring costs outside the healthcare sector as there are no databases av ailable which contain this type information. For a more standardized approach to the valuation for identified costs, the Dutch Healthcare Institute has published the Guideline for Cost Research in the Netherlands; this includes standardized cost prices for the most common healthcare resources.31 2.2.3 The cost-effectiveness criteria To value the expediency, or cost -effectiveness, of a certain in tervention or treatment, it is essential to calculate the incr emental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). This ratio combines both the costs and effects of two treatments into a single measure using the following formula: Where Costs intervention group and Costs control group represent the total costs during the total period of the study and Effects intervention group and Effects control group represent the effects at the end of the follow-up. Using this formula, one can calculate the extra costs of one unit of effect. In case of a CUA, this will be the costs per one additional QALY gained. For easy interpretation of the ICER, it is impo rtant to plot it in a cost-effectiveness plane (CE-plane). This is a graph in which the incremental effects ar e shown on the x-axis and the incremental costs on the y-axis. The slope of the point estimate (from the origin of the graph) represents the ICER. The CE-plane ca n be divided into four quadrants (see Figure 1.3). An ICER in quadrant A represents lower effects combined with higher costs; hence the intervention is dominated by th e comparator. An ICER in quadrant D is associated with more effects and lower co sts; hence the intervention dominates the comparator. ICERs in quadrant B&C are more diffi cult to judge as the intervention is either more expensive but results in more effects (B), or the intervention is less expensive but also less effective (C). Hence, one should know how much society is willing to pay for a particular gain in clinical benefits. To help decision-makers in thes e scenarios, the Dutch Council for Public Health and Healthcare ha s provided a report with guidance on the ceiling ratios for a QALY for specific disability weights. Based on this report, the ceiling ratio can be roughly estimated to be \u20ac20,000-80,000 per QALY depending on the severity of the disease or disorder.32 ICER =(Costsintervention group -C o s t scontrol group (Effectsintervention group -E f f e c t scontrol group )ICER =(Costsintervention group -C o s t scontrol group ) (Effectsintervention group -E f f e c t scontrol group ) General introduction to the thesis 17 1 Figure 1.3 Example of a (fictional) cost-effect iveness plane including a fictional threshold. 2.2.4 Uncertainty encountere d in economic evaluations One of the most common forms of uncertainty is sampling uncertainty. In every economic evaluation it is possible that, by chance, pa tients with extremely high or low costs are included in the study which can heavily impa ct the ICER. To investigate the uncertainty surrounding the ICER, a technique called bootstrapping is often used. When bootstrapping, one creates N times (usually 5000 times) a new sample out of the original sample with replacement. This results in N different samples, each with a different ICER. When plotting these ICERs in a CE-plane, on e can visualize the uncertainty around the ICER (see Figure 1.3). Alternatively, one can also calculate the 95% confidence interval by selecting the 2.5th percentile and 97.5th percentile. 3. Outline of the present thesis The title of this thesis is \" Health technology asse ssment in epilepsy; moving towards patient- centered, efficient care\". In order to actually achieve mo re patient-centered and efficient care, it is important to examine these two doma ins more carefully. Therefore, the first two parts of this thesis are devote d to: 1) methodological aspect s and preference-based studies in the health technology assessment of he althcare interventions, and 2) economic evaluations within epilepsy, as the ultimate goal of most economic evaluations is to assess the efficiency of particular health care interventions or treatments . The last part consists of a more elaborate discussion on the results foun d in this thesis and the implications and Quadrant A Quadrant B Quadrant D Quadrant CChapter 1 18 recommendations for further research. Guided by research questions, the thesis is outlined below. 3.1 Part I: Methodological aspects and preference- based studies in the health technology assessment of epilepsy Research question 1 - What preferences do people have regarding epilepsy diagnostics and the valuation of clinical manifestations of epilepsy? Preference studies are a trivia l concept within health techno logy assessment. Preferences can be obtained from specific (epilepsy) patie nts or from the genera l public, depending on one's objectives. Chapter 2 provides insight into patients' pr eferences regarding epilepsy diagnostics by means of a discrete-choice experiment. In the (primary) diagnosis of epilepsy, it is reasonable to assume that, besides psychometric s, such as sensitivity and specificity, other factors or attributes may play an important role in the willingness of patients to be diagnosed with a certain modality. One coul d think of attributes like preparation, technique, complication rate, duration, whether or not they have to travel, sound, pain, invasiveness and discomfort. Chapter 2 examines patients' preference for several attributes of diagnostic modalities in the primary diagnosis of epilepsy. A discrete-choice experiment involves a series of hypothetical scenario s (two each time), which consist of several attributes (e.g. travel time, freedom of movement) varying according to level (e.g. 15-60 min travel time; no freedom of movement o r f r e e d o m o f m o v e m e n t i s p e r m i t t e d ) . Each time patients were asked to se lect the most preferred option. In chapter 3, preferences are derived from the general public to determine utility values for several epilepsy health st ates. This is important as, co mpared to epilepsy-specific outcomes, utilities are easier to compare betw een diseases and can be used to calculate QALYs. For this study, the time-trade-off me thodology was used. Hence, in a situation where only epilepsy-specific outcomes (suc h as seizure frequency and severity) are available, one could potentially estimate utilities for epilepsy health states. Research question 2 - How do generic qua lity of life instruments compare to epilepsy- specific quality of life instruments? In chapter 4, a generic quality of life instru ment is compared with an epilepsy-specific quality of life. The use of generic instruments is important for policy-makers; however, the lack of sensitivity of these instruments may be a matter of concern. If generic instruments are found to be less sensitive to change in patients with epilepsy, interventions may be deemed to be not effective when in fact they are. Given the importance of generic instruments in decision-making, a lack of improvement in quality of life could mean the difference between in- or excluding the (new) trea tment in the health insurance package. General introduction to the thesis 19 1 Research question 3 - To what extent is a novel method to elicit preferences used to determine preferences in healthcare? Chapter 5 describes an examination of the use of best-worst scaling (BWS) in healthcare. As discussed in chapter 2, discrete-choic e experiments (DCE) have been used in healthcare since the 1990s for various pu rposes involving several stakeholders.33 The review by Clark et al.33 has provided an overview of DCEs in healthcare and may have stimulated the development an d the use of DCEs within healthcare. BWS is, however, a relatively novel method to elicit patients' pr eferences and has been argued to overcome some drawbacks of the DCE. For example, a BWS can include more items than a DCE (especially for BWS case 1), and a BWS is assu med to be easier to complete, as people are, in general, used to discriminating betw een extremes. The overvi ew of BWS provided in chapter 5 sheds some light on its applicatio n in healthcare. This may increase awareness of BWS among researchers in the field of health techno logy assessment and provide insights into the various purposes for which it can be applied. 3.2 Part II: Economic evalua tions within epilepsy Research question 4 - How to appraise economic evaluations and the applicability of an economic evaluation to a particular setting? When using economic evaluation s for decision-making or clinical practice guideline (CPG) development, it is essential to determine their quality and applicability. Many quality and transferability checklists have been developed over the years, and so in chapter 6 we have tried to clarify the situation by providing some guidance as to which checklists could be used when appraising the quality and tr ansferability of economic evaluations. Research question 5 - What are cost-effective tr eatments and strategies in epilepsy care? A good basis for examining cost-effective treatmen ts in epilepsy, is the identification of all currently available evidence. Chapter 7 reports results of a systematic literature review, focusing on all available treatm ents for people with epilepsy. In chapter 8, the long-term (clinical) outcom es of a randomized controlled trial on the cost-effectiveness of the ketogeni c diet are presented. In this study, effects and costs of the ketogenic diet were compared to care as usual in children an d adolescents with intractable epilepsy. Chapters 9 & 10, respectively, describe the design and cost-effec tiveness results of a multi-component intervention for adult patients wi th epilepsy. Both costs and effects of the intervention and care as usual group were compared. The multi-co mponent intervention was aimed at improving a patient's ability to self-manage his or her disease and at increasing adherence to medication. Chapter 1 20 4. Part III - Discussion and summary Chapter 11 is an elaborate discus sion on the results found in se veral chapters of this thesis as well as the implications and re commendations for further research. Lastly, chapters 12 & 13 provide a summary of the thesis in both English (chapter 12) and Dutch (chapter 13). General introduction to the thesis 21 1 References 1. World Health Organization.

Methodological aspects and preference based studies in the health technology assessment of epilepsy 25 Eliciting patients' preferences for epilepsy diagnostics A discrete choice & Behavior, 2014;31:102-109 Chapter 2 26 Abstract Background Diagnosing epilepsy is a lengthy and burdensome process for patients and their family. Although the need for a more patient- centered approach in clinic al practice is widely acknowledged, empirical evidence regarding patient preferences for diagnostic modalities in epilepsy is missing. The objectives of this study are 1) to identify to what extent important attributes of diagnostic procedures in epilepsy affect preferences for a procedure; 2) to determine the relative importance of these attributes; 3) to calculate overall utility scores for routine electroencep halography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. Methods A discrete choice experiment was performed to determine patients' pref erences, which involved presentation of pair-wis e choice tasks regarding hypothetical scenarios. Scenarios varied along six attributes: \"Way of \"Chance of additional examination\". Choice tasks were constructed using a statistically efficient design and the questionnaire contained 15 unique unlabeled choice tasks. Mixed multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate patients' preferences. Results A total of 289 questionnaires were included in the analysis. McFadden's pseudo R2 showed a model fit of 0.28 and all attributes were statistically significant. Heterogeneity in preferences was present for all attributes. \"Freedom of movement\" and \"Chance of additional examination\" were perceived as the most important attributes. Overall utility scores did not substantially differ between routine EEG and MEG. Conclusions This study suggests that the identified attributes are important in determining patients' preference for epilepsy diagnostics. It can be concluded that MEG is not necessarily more patient-friendly than a routine EEG in primary diagnostics and, regarding additional diagnostics, patients have a strong preference for long-term 24h EEG over EEG after sleep deprivation. Furthermore, barring substantial heterogeneity within the parameters in mind, our study suggests that it is important to take individual preferences in to account in medical decision-making. Patients' preferences for epilepsy diagnostics 27 2 1. Introduction Epilepsy is a severe brain disease with a large impact on patients' quality of life,1,2 their surrounding and society as a whole.3,4 It is one of the most prevalent non-communicable neurologic diseases and estimated to affect almost 70 million people around the world.5,6 Internationally, the incidence of epilepsy is estimated at 50 per 100,000 people, with large differences between high-income coun tries (45/100,000) and low- and middle- income countries (82/100,000).5-7 Diagnosing epilepsy is a lengthy process that can be a burden for the patient and has a large impact on the health system, while misdiagnoses are quite common. Of patients diagnosed w ith epilepsy who are presented at epilepsy centers, 20% to 30% are found to have been misdiagnosed.8-10 According to several European guidelines,11-13 it is recommended that an Electroencephalography (EEG) should be perf ormed to support a diagnosis of epilepsy in patients in whom the clinical history suggest th at the symptoms are likely to be epileptic in origin. Consequently, EEG is the most used diagnostic procedure for epilepsy.14 However, its sensitivity and specificity depends on several factors such as age and recording procedures (e.g. activation procedures such as provoked hyperventilation or photic stimulation).14 A routine EEG recording in a patient with epilepsy will show no epileptiform activity in about 50% of cases.15 H e n c e , a d d i t i o n a l E E G e x aminations are needed to increase diagnostic yield by increasing epilep tiform activity without inducing seizures. To this extent, EEG after sleep deprivation ( EEGsd) and long-term 24h-EEG are generally recommended.11-13,15 The latter is often used in childre n or mentally ill patients, since an EEGsd is considered to be too burdensome for these patients. Nonetheless, both 24h-EEG and EEGsd, ha ve considerable disadvantages. Sleep deprivation is shown to elicit seizures,15-18 which is supported by the fact that it is still one of the three most important seizure induci ng factors mentioned by patients in questionnaires.19-21 The 24h-EEG impairs patients in thei r daily routine; wires attached to the portable EEG-recorder refrain them from ph ysical exercises and limit their freedom of movement. An alternative to these diagnostic proced ures is magnetoencephalography (MEG), which seems to be a more patient friendly way to detect epileptiform discharges,22 potentially with great diagnostic value in the early stage of the diagnostic process.22-24 MEG is a non-invasive technique that enables recording of epileptiform discharges over the whole head, with minimal preparatio ns. Nevertheless, MEG also has some considerable disadvantages; most importantly a MEG recording requires that patient's move as little as possible, which coul d be very limiting for some patients. It is important to include patients' preference s in evaluation of health technologies as patients differ from each other in their biologic , social or cultural characteristics as well as in their preferences. Although the need for a more patient-centered approach in clinical practice and evaluation stud ies is widely acknowledged25-27 and patients preferences have been shown to significantly impact th eir willingness to use healthcare services,28-30 empirical evidence is missing regarding pat ients' preferences for routine EEG, EEGsd, Chapter 2 28 24h-EEG, and MEG as diagnostic tools in epilepsy. Using a discrete choice experiment (DCE), the present study attempted to determin e patients' preferences for different elements of the diagnostic trajectory of epilepsy. The DCE involved presentation of a series of pair- wise choice tasks regarding hypothetical scenarios.31,32 DCEs have increasingly been used in health care as an approach to elicit patient s' preferences for medication attributes and have been applied in similar cases (e.g. patie nts' preferences regarding several screening tests).33-37 Therefore, the objectives of this study are 1) to identify to what extent important attributes of diagnostic procedures in epileps y affect patients' prefer ences for a procedure; 2) to determine the relative importance of these attributes; and 3) to calculate overall utility scores for routine EEG and MEG recordings. 2. Methods 2.1. Discrete choice experiment A DCE is an attribute-based stated preference valuation technique.32 In DCEs, individuals are presented with a series of hypothetical choice tasks and are asked to express a preference. The technique is based on the prem ises that healthcare interventions can be described by a number of attributes and th at preferences for these interventions are influenced by the variations (i.e. levels ) within these attrib utes (see Table 2.1).32 Using these attributes and levels, one can co nstruct a \"scenario\" by choosing a level for each attribute. Subsequently, responde nts are asked to indicate, by pairwise comparison of alternative scenarios, which would be their preferred option (see Figure 2.1). In this way, respondents are encourage d to make a trade-off between attributes and their corresponding levels. Afterwards, the re lative importance of each attribute (and corresponding levels) can be iden tified using a regression model. In this study, an unlabeled DCE is used (i .e. the alternatives are named method A and method B, instead of e.g. EEG and MEG), mainly because the labeled alternatives themselves convey information to respondents. Thus, in a labeled design, respondents may use labeled alternatives to deduce informatio n which they perceive as missing, particularly when patients are familiar with some of the alternatives.38 Hence, an unlabeled DCE might encourage respondents to choose an altern ative by only trading-off attribute levels.38 DCE methodology is well de scribed in the literature.31,32 This study was conducted according to the stepped approach proposed by Ryan and Farrar.39 Patients' preferences for epilepsy diagnostics 29 2 Table 2.1 Attributes and levels for epilepsy diagnostics Attributes Levels Way of measuring brain activity Sensor net (Base case*) Helmet Electro cap Duration of recording** 30 minutes 60 minutes 90 minutes Freedom of movement Minor movements possible (Base case*) No movements possible Travel time 30 minutes 60 minutes 90 minutes Type of additional examination 24h-EEG (Base level*) EEG after sleep deprivation Chance of additional examination** 20 out of 100 patients 35 out of 100 patients 50 out of 100 patients * Level of the attribute which was used as the referenc e level; ** Estimated as cont inuous variable within the MMNL model Characteristics Method A Method B Way of measuring brain activity By use of a helmet By use of an electro cap Duration of recording 30 minutes 90 minutes Freedom of movement No movements possible Minor movements possible Travel time 30 minutes 90 minutes Type of additional examination EEG after sleep deprivation 24-hour EEG Chance of additional examination 50% (50 out of 100 patients) 20% (20 out of 100 patients) Which option do you prefer? Figure 2.1 Example of unlabeled choi ce set as presented to patients 2.2 Identifying attributes and levels Attributes were identified ba sed on literature review,11,12,14,15,22 expert and patient interviews (n=7, three neurologists; two pat ients and two laboratory technicians) and observations during clinical practice. Expert and patient interviews we re semi-structured to give participants the opportunity to explain th eir thoughts rather th an forcing them to choose from fixed responses. In our case, due to the impact on the random component variability40 and to minimize cognitive burden,41 the number of attributes was limited to six. Other attributes were considered to be less relevant or were left out due to commonality between attributes. The final attributes, based on a consensus meeting with clinicians and experts, were: 1) way of measuring brain activity, 2) duration of the recording (DURATION), 3) freedom of movement (FOM), 4) travel time (TT), 5) type of additional examination (TAE), and 6) chance of addition al examination (CAE) (see Table 2.1). Levels for the first attribute were chosen to repres ent a routine EEG recording (electro cap); MEG recording and g with a HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net.42 Chapter 2 30 The addition of the sensor net, which is sa id to not require any scalp preparation or abrasion, was merely to see what the impact of future improvements in EEG recording might offer to patients. Levels for the attribute \"Chance of addition al examination\" were based on previous studies regarding the sensitivity of MEG and EEG.14,22,23,43,44 Other levels were determined based on expert opinion (i.e. trav el time; and type of additional examination) and clinical characteristics of each recording (i.e. duration of recording; and freedom of movement). Travel time was taken into account as up to now the availability of MEG in the Netherlands is limited. 2.3 Designing choice sets and questionnaire The choice sets are constructed using Ng ene (Version 1.1.1, http://www.choice- metrics.com/). Four attributes with three levels, and two attrib utes with two levels, result in 34 * 22 = 324 hypothetical scenarios. Hence, for practical reasons, a fractional factorial design (subset of hypothetical scenarios) was used. The fractional factorial design was construc ted using Bayesian principles, a so-called Bayesian optimal or statistically efficient design . Using an efficient design it is possible to maximize the precision of estimated parameter s for a given number of choice tasks (by maximizing D-efficiency).45,46 The statistically efficient de sign approach assumes a prior distribution of likely parameter values (e.g. the beta coefficients in th e regression analysis) for some or all parameters.47 For example, it is likely to assume that patients prefer a shorter duration of recording and travel time. Therefore, these attributes were assumed to have a negative sign (i.e. longer durati on decreases patient s' preferences). Within each choice task, re spondents were asked to ch oose between two unlabeled scenarios (see Figure 2.1). We did not in clude an opt-out opti on representing the alternative 'no diagnostic testing'. This way, respondents were forced to make trade-offs between attributes and it ensured that re spondents could not avoid difficult decisions.48,49 Moreover, little information is captured in term s of attribute level trade-offs when such an option is selected. After a short introduction to the study, re spondents were given a detailed description about the DCE task. Next, attributes and le vels were explained and an example of a choice set was shown. Subsequently, the ch oice tasks were presented and, lastly, respondent characteristics were collected. The final version of the questi onnaire contained 15 unique choice tasks. To evaluate the test-retest reliability of the questionnaire, on e choice task was repeated at the end of the questionnaire. This makes a total of 16 choice tasks per respondents, which is considered good practice and co gnitively acceptable.50,51 Afterwards, respondents were asked to evaluate the difficulty of the tasks on a seve n-point scale ranging from \"very easy\" to \"very difficult\". The questionnaire was pilot tested amon g experts to ensure that the levels of each choice were relevant and comprehensible. The full questionnaire in Dutch is available from the authors on request. Patients' preferences for epilepsy diagnostics 31 2 2.4 Data collection and participants The study was conducted in the outpatient clin ic of Kempenhaeghe, expertise centre in the field of epilepsy, and at the University Me dical Centre Utrecht (UMCU). Both involved parties have a leading role in the application of MEG in clinical epilepsy research. Data was collected between February and April 2013. The DCE questionnaire was sent by mail to 1009 patients, completed by the patients at home and returned in a postage-paid envelope. All patients had to be at least 18 years of age, diagnosed as having epilepsy, visited the outpatient clinic of Kempenhaeghe in the past year and home- dwelling. Patients living in specialized healthca re institutions (i.e. for mentally handicapped patients) were excluded from the study. Due to the limited application of MEG in primary diagnostics of epilepsy, we deliberately co ntacted patients from UMCU, experienced with MEG, to ensure that these patients were represented in the sample. Only patients who agreed to be contacted fo r participation in (clinical) studies were approached. An information letter attached to th e questionnaire was sent to these patients, which explained that by returning the questi onnaire respondents consented to participate in the study. Approval for this consent proc edure and study was obta ined from the ethics committee of Kempenhaeghe and UMCU. 2.5 Statistics and data analysis Discrete choice data were analyzed using Nlog it version 5 (Econometric Software, Inc). A mixed multinomial logit model (MMNL) was used to determine the effect of the attribute levels on patients' preferences. Respondents who completed less than five choice sets were excluded from the analysis. MMNL was chosen to allow for possible pref erence heterogeneity across respondents and to account for the panel nature of the data.38,52 A MMNL model is constructed regarding the assumption that parameters ar e randomly distributed in the population. Heterogeneity within these parameters ca n be assessed by estimating the standard deviation of the parameters.46 Therefore, MMNL is able to relax some or all of the assumptions of the standard multinomial log it model, most importantly homogeneity of patients' preferences.52 The six attributes in the DCE were modelle d as determinants of whether respondents A\" or \"Method B\", hence the diffe rence in utility between both scenarios. Therefore, the regression function to be estimated had the following form: Vij = (1 + 1i) * HELMET + ( 2 + 2i) * ELECTROCAP + (3 + 3i) * DURATION + ( 4 + 4i) * FOM + ( 5 + 5i) * TT + (6 + 6i) * TAE + (7 + 7i) * CAE + ij In which the value of the regression coefficien ts indicate the relative importance of the attribute; V represents the observable relative utility; and i represents the standard deviation of the random parameter. Lastly, ij + ij captures the individual-specific Chapter 2 32 unexplained variance around the mean.46 N o c o n s t a n t t e r m w a s i n c l u d e d i n t h e f i n a l model as the constant term repr esents the mean of the unobse rved effects for each of the alternatives, after accounting for the role ea ch attribute plays in the decision making process.52 Hence, in an unlabeled design, a significant constant term would be an indication of left-to right bias (i.e. tendency to consistently choose either the first or the second alternative in the choice task).48 To describe categorica l variables, dummy coding was used for ease of interpretation, base-c ase levels can be found in Table 2.1. We tested interactions between attributes and between attributes and respondent characteristics. All parameters included in the MMNL model were treated as random parameters and estimated using 2000 Halton draws. Parameters were tested for significance at =0.05 and assumed to be normally distributed. Next, model fit was assessed using log-likelihood and McFadden's ps eudo-R\u00b2. To test for left-to right bias the constant term was included in the initial an alyses. To account for scale differences and ease of interpretation, relative importance weights were calculated using the method described by Malhotra and Birks.53 For continuous variables we based this calculation on the total range of the attribute. Reliability analyses were conducted to expl ore the impact of respondents who failed the test-retest and to explore the impact of di fferences in perceived difficulty. Additional analyses were performed on age (two groups; split by mean value), educational level (two groups, split by mean value), and gender, by me ans of creating intera ction terms within the final model. These analyses were done to as sess the potential impact of covariates and to explain some heterogeneity within the data. Results of the MMNL model were translated to clinical practice. As mentioned above, levels for each attribute were chosen based on expert opinion and clinical characteristics of each recording. Using this information, one can (hypothetically) compare routine EEG and MEG by selecting levels which closely rese mble clinical features of each recording and calculate overall utility scores using the utility function derived by the MMNL model. The lower the overall utility score, the less preferred that scenario is. Data file and additional analyses can be retrieved by contacting the corresponding author. 3. Results 3.1 Respondent characteristics A total of 304 respondents (30.1%) completed the DCE questionnaire. Excluding respondents who completed five choice tasks or less, a to tal of 289 questionnaires were included in the analysis. Mean age of th e respondents was 45.5 years. Nearly all respondents reported to have experience w ith epilepsy diagnostic using brain imaging techniques; only 5.9% reported not to have experience with any of the techniques. Other patient characteristics are pres ented in Table 2.2. No signif icant differences were found between responders and non-responders for all respondent characteristics.

All attrib utes are statistically significant, which provides evidence of the theoretical va lidity of the model and indicates that the attributes are considered as being import ant in determining pa tients' preferences.28 The regression coefficient for each attribute level represents the mean part-worth utility of that attribute level in the respondent sample. A negative -coefficient indicates that as the level of the attribute increases, utility is decreasi ng. Results of the MMNL model are presented in Table 2.3. The estimated coefficients all have the an ticipated negative sign, apart from \"Way of measuring brain activity\" and \"Type of additiona l examination\", of which no specific effect was anticipated.

Table represents -coefficients from MMNL model. The regression coefficients represent th e mean part-worth utility of that attribute in the respondent sample. CI: Confidence interval. To determine which attribute has the larges t impact on patients' preferences, it is convenient to look at the relative importance weights as they repres ent the importance of each attribute in percentages (see Table 2.4) . As shown, \"Freedom of movement\" has the largest impact on patients' preference (27%). Respondents had a sign ificant preference for scenarios in which minor movements were poss ible. The attribute with the second largest impact on patients' preference was \"Chance of additional examination\" (26%), indicating respondents preferred a lower chance of additional examination. Furthermore, respondents had a significant pr eference for shorter recording (16%), shorter travel times (13%), and significantly pr eferred 24h-EEG over EEGsd (14%). As for the way of measuring brain activity (4%), respondents sign ificantly preferred the sensor net over the helmet, but had no significant preference be tween the sensor net and the electro cap. Furthermore, standard deviations of the ra ndom parameters were significant for all attributes, which is an indication of preference heterogeneity within th e sample. Hence, this shows the presence of variations in the im portance of attributes between respondents.46,52 Table 2.4 Relative importance of attributes (in percentage) for the total sample, males and females Attribute Total sample (N=289) Males (N=130) Females (N=158) Way of additional examination 26% 26% 17% Patients' preferences for epilepsy diagnostics 35 2 3.3 Differences in preferen ces between subgroups Different subgroup analyses, based on intera ction terms within the final model, were examined. Models with interactions between a ttributes and covariates (educational level, age, experience with MEG/EEG(sd/24h), difficult y) were tested, but all covariates turned out to be non-significant. However, a sign ificant difference was found between males and females. Results of the model for male and fe male respondents are presented in Table 2.5. Female respondents had a significantly stronger preference for recordings in which minor movements were possible, as can also be seen when looking at the difference in relative importance weights (see Table 2.4). Stratif ied analysis based on gender had large implications on the relative importance we ights. In males, \"Chance of additional examination\" turns out to be the most impo rtant attribute (26%); whereas in females \"Freedom of movement\" is still the most impo rtant attribute (31%). Preference for other attributes did not significantly differ between males and females. 3.4 Reliability and difficulty A total of 248 respondents (85.8%) successf ully completed the test-retest exercise. Analyses excluding respondents who failed th e test-retest showed a significant difference between the relative importance of the \"E lectro cap\". Respondents who successfully completed the test-retest exercise significantly preferred a sens or net over an electro cap, whereas respondents who failed the test-retest had no signif icant preference between the two modalities (see Table 2.6). Excluding resp ondents who failed the test-retest exercise improved McFadden's pseudo-R\u00b2 to 0.30. Difficulty of the task was estimated on average at 3.78 on a scale from 1 to 7. The task was perceived relatively easy (score 1 to 3) by 114 respondents (39.4%) while 102 respondents (35.3%) perceived the task as relati vely difficult (score 5 to 7). No significant differences were found between respondents who perceived the task as relatively difficult and respondents who perceived the task as relatively easy. Excluding respondents who perceived the task as extremely difficult (sco re 7), only marginally improved McFadden's pseudo R2 (from 0.275 to 0.281).

Patients' preferences for epilepsy diagnostics 37 2 3.5 Translation to clinical characterist ics of diagnostic modalities Overall utility scores for routine EEG and MEG were -5.97 and -6.12 (see Figure 2.2). Hence, in general, albeit the difference is marginal, routine EEG is preferred over MEG. However, when stratifying for gender, it can be seen that males pref er MEG over routine EEG whereas females prefer routine EEG over MEG. As this study mainly focuses on discomforts of each modality, overall utility sc ores are negative. However, this does not imply that patients would prefer to not be diag nosed with EEG or MEG at all as an opt-out option was not included into the choice tasks. Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this is the firs t study to investigate patients' preferences for brain imaging techniques in the primary diagno sis of epilepsy. This study was designed to identify to what extent important attributes of diagnostic procedures in epilepsy affected preferences for a procedure and to determine the relative importance of these attributes. The overall fit of the model, as assessed with McFadden's pseudo R2, was 0.28 and, when excluding respondents who failed the test-retest exercise , it increased to 0.30. Both represent a decent model fit for a disc rete choice model, as a pseudo R2 of 0.30 represents a R2 of approximately 0.6 for the equivalent R2 of a linear regression model.52 Our results indicate that respondents would prefer a test with a short du ration, a short travel time, in which minor movements are possible, th e electric activity of the brain should be recorded by either a sensor net or an electr o cap, a low chance of additional examination and, when additional examinations are ne cessary, it should preferably be 24h-EEG. When looking at the relative importance weights, two attributes stand out: \"Chance of additional examinations\" and \"Freedom of movement\". The attribute \"Chance of additional examination\", was expected to ha ve a large influence as it relates to the sensitivity of a recording, which is often sh own to be of great impact in preference studies.29,54,55 Regarding \"Freedom of movement\", we anticipated the fact that patients would prefer recordings in wh ich minor movements are possible. However, on forehand, it was not entirely evident to assume that it would be the most influential factor in determining patients' preferences. Given th ese importance weights, one could argue that, albeit the presumed higher sensitivity and shorter duration of MEG, it is not straightforward to assume that, in general, patients woul d prefer MEG over routine EEG as shown in Figure 2.2. The comparison between both types of additiona l examination, EEGsd and 24h-EEG, is more clear-cut. For additional diagnostics, this study suggest that patients have a strong preference for 24h-EEG over EEGsd, which co uld be explained by the fact that sleep deprivation may induce seizures and therefore, patients might try to avoid it. In current practice, 24h-EEG is often used in mentally ill patients or children. However, this study suggests that 24h-EEG could be a more patient -friendly alternative for other patients as well.

A part of the heterogeneity could be explained by the interaction betwee n males and females regarding the attribute \"Freedom of movement\" and by the interactio n regarding the level \"Electro cap\" between respondents who successfully completed the te st-retest exercise and who failed the test- retest exercise. These interactions highlight th e fact that preferences could be substantially different between subgroups and even betw een individuals within a subgroup. For example, differences between males and fe males regarding \"Freedom of movement\" could have an impact on their preferred diagnostic modality. Other factors explaining the heterogeneity in preferences could not be identified from the available data. This study has several limitations. First, as Kempenhaeghe and UMCU are expertise centers in the field of epilepsy, often the most complex or severe patients are being referred to these institutes. This is also supported by th e fact that a relatively large percentage of the respondents (56.7%) had experience with 24h -EEG, which is regularly only used in a specific subset of the patients. Therefore, se lection of the sample could potentially be a problem and our findings may only be limite d generalizable to the overall epilepsy-care within the Netherlands. Second, we encountered a response rate of 30.1% which is moderately low. Response rates to postal questionnaires are approximately 62%,56 however regarding DCEs large variations are reported ranging from 10% to 98%.57,58 Some respondents reported difficulties when filling in the questionnaire (i.e. cognitive burden or too much attributes to take into account) which could be an expl anation for the low response rate. The DCE method can be cognitively demanding which could lead to biased results by reducing respondents' ability to make a well-consid ered choice between different scenarios, especially because epilepsy is often associated with cognitive impairments.41,59 However, stratified analyses between resp ondents who perceived the task as relatively difficult and respondents who perceived the task as rela tively easy, did not show any significant differences. Furthermore, no differences we re found between patients with different educational levels. Lastly, in our sample a reasonable amount of respondents (21.8%) reported experience with MEG recording, which is relativ ely high as MEG is currently only used as pre-surgical evaluation instrument or in sc ientific research. In addition, a reasonable amount of respondents (24.2%) reported to have not been diagnosed with routine EEG. Hence, given that in 2012, according to the Dutch Taskforce for Epilepsy Surgery, approximately 180 patients were referred for pre- surgical evaluation and the fact that a routine EEG is recommended as a first step of the diagnostic process in all European guidelines,11-13 recall bias is likely to be present w ithin our sample. However, we have to rely on data as reported by respondents. In conclusion, our study suggests that the wa y brain activity is measured, duration of the recording, freedom of movement, travel time, type of additional exam ination, and chance of additional examination are all important a ttributes in determinin g patients' preference for epilepsy diagnostics. The attributes with the largest impact on pat ients' preferences are Chapter 2 40 freedom of movement and type of additional ex amination. Translated to clinical practice, this means that MEG is not necessarily more patient-friendly than a routine EEG, although an external validation study, comparing reve aled preferences in patients experiencing both routine EEG and MEG, would be required to confirm this fi nding. Furthermore, regarding additional diagnostics, it can be concluded that patients have a strong preference for 24h-EEG over EEGsd, which co uld help physicians in medical decision- making. Additionally, barring the substantial he terogeneity within the parameters in mind, it is important to take individual preferences into account in medica l decision-making to improve epilepsy diagnostics. We believe that this study can be a valuab le contribution to patient-centered care within epilepsy diagnostics. Understanding and incorporating patients' preferences in the diagnostic trajectory of epilepsy (i.e. prefe rred type of additional examination) could improve the lengthy and burdensome process wh ich is often associated with the diagnosis of epilepsy.10 In addition, incorporating patients' pr eferences into medical decision-making has been shown to significantly impact thei r willingness to use healthcare services.28-30 Recent studies have however revealed a di sparity between patients' preferences and those of physicians.60,61 For most conditions, physicians underestimated the impact of intervention characteristics on patients' decision making.61 Moreover, although it has been shown that a majority of physicians identifi ed patient preferences as the most important general ethical guideline for surrogate deci sion-making, their me dical decision-making relied on a variety of factors including progno sis, costs, patients' pain and suffering, and what was best for the patient overall (whi ch closely resembles their preferences).62 In the Netherlands, the unit price of a ME G recording is about 200 Euros whereas the unit price of a 24h-EEG or an EEGsd record ing is about 160 Euros (price index year 2011).63 While the MEG recording is more expensiv e at first sight, the cost-effectiveness (i.e. value for money) of this modality in epilepsy diagnostics will highly depend on the quantity and quality of the data delivered by the MEG recording compared to the data of a 24h-EEG and EEGsd recording. Although Co lon et al. (2009) examined the additional value of MEG compared to EEGsd, future rese arch should try to identify the informational value of the various diagnostic tests in relation to their financial implications as no studies have yet been performed on routine EEG, EEGsd, 24h-EEG and MEG in a head-to-head comparison. Furthermore, future research shou ld try to identify sources of heterogeneity between epilepsy patients and the importan ce of incorporating these individual preferences in medica l decision-making.

Chapter 2 45 From clinically relevant outcome measures to quality of life in epilepsy A time trade-off study R.J.A. de *This study has been part of the PhD thesis of dr. R.J.A. de Kinderen Chapter 3 46 Abstract Objective A proposed method for bridging the gap between clinically relevant epilepsy outcome measures and quality-adjusted life years is to derive utility scores for epilepsy health states. The aim of this study is to develop such a utility- function and to invest igate the impact of the epilepsy outcome measures on utility. Methods Health states, based on clinically important epilepsy attributes (e.g. seizure frequency, seizure severity, side-effects), were valued by a sample of the Dutch population (N=525) based on the time trade-off method. In addition to standard demographics, every participant was asked to rate 10 or 11 different health state scenarios. A multilevel regression analysis was performed to account for the nested structure of the data. Results Results show that the best health state (no seizures and no side-effects) is estimated at 0.89 and the worst state (seizures type 5 twice a day plus severe side-effects) at 0.22 (scale: 0- 1). An increase in seizure frequency, occurrence of side-effects, and seizure severity were all significantly associated with lower utility values. Furthermore, seizure severity has the largest impact on quality of life compared with seizure frequency and side-effects. Conclusions This study provides a utility-function for transforming clinically relevant epilepsy outcome measures into utility estimates. We advise using our utility-function in economic evaluations, when quality of life is not directly measured in a study and hence, no health state utilities are available, or when there is convincing empirical evidence of the insensitivity of a generic quality-of-life-instrument within epilepsy. Utilities for clinical outcomes in epilepsy 47 3 1. Introduction Quality of life (QoL) is a very important outcom e measure, not only for patients, but also as an input for cost-utility analyses. A cost-utility analysis is a form of economic evaluation in which costs and benefits of alternative inte rventions are compared to see whether the investigated intervention offers good 'value for money'. The benefits of a cost-utility analysis are expressed in Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), which incorporate effects in terms of both QoL (utilities) and survival (lif e-years gained). The value a person assigns to a particular health state (i.e. description of a pa rticular set of symptoms which is common to a particular disease) is commonly referred to as a utility, and lies on a scale where death and full health are assigned values of 0 and 1, respectively. Using utility values one can calculate QALYs by multiplying the numbers of life-years gained by the utility of those added life-years. However, the essential utilitie s are not always available. Especially in case of model-based, cost-utility analyses , where researchers ar e dependent on the published literature, suitable utilities for certain health states are often hard to find. Obviously, as utilities are used to calculat e QALYs, they need to be measured in a methodologically sound and preferably uniform manner. He nce, the ISPOR Task force regarding the measurement of utilities, called for the use of direct utility elicitation methods, such as the standard gamble (SG) or time trade-off (TTO) exercises.1 Problems in gathering utility values may o ccur because clinical trials and clinical evaluations measure the effects of intervention s with common clinically relevant measures, rather than with QoL-measures. Within the field of epilepsy, three disease-sp ecific clinical outcome measures are often used to reflect patients' health, namely; seizur e frequency, seizure se verity and side-effects due to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Frequency and severity of seizur es in people with epilepsy vary from one individual to another. In some people, seizures are very severe and occur frequently despite treatment with AEDs. In others, seizures are mild, less frequent and more easily controll ed by AEDs. Seizure severity is measured using standardized questionnaires. One of the most frequently used seizure severity questionnaires focusing on the clinical events of a seizure, is the Nati onal Hospital Seizure Se verity Scale (NHS3), a revised and simplified version of the Chalfont scale.2 In order to bridge the gap between clinical trials, whic h measure clinical outcomes, and economic evaluations, which require utility values, it would be preferable if one could make clinically relevant epilepsy outcome meas ures applicable to cost-utility analysis by deriving utility scores for the epilepsy outcom e measures. For this purpose, the TTO method was used, in which participants are asked to determine how many life years one is willing to give up in order to avoid a particular health state.3 This method has been used before in four other studies which elicited utilities for epilepsy health states. Firstly, Messori et al. (1998) interviewed a small series of refractory epilepsy patients (N=81) and asked them how much of their current state of health they wo uld be willing to give up in order to live the remaining years in excellent health.4 Secondly, Forbes et al. (2003) executed a TTO experiment among a smaller grou p of epilepsy patients (N=43).5 H o w e v e r , o n l y s e v e n Chapter 3 48 patients understood the exercise.5 Thirdly, Carroll and Downs (2009) interviewed a large group of parents (N=4016) to obtain their assessment of various health states while imagining that it would be one of their child ren who was experiencing the health state under consideration.6 Lastly, Kang et al. (2014) asked the general population (N=300) to assess three epilepsy health states.7 These published TTO-studies elicited utilities for a very small number of specific health states (i.e. 1-5); furthermore, in these studies, seizure severity and side-effects were not (fully) in cluded in the health state description. To overcome this gap, the objective of this st udy is twofold: first of all, to create a reliable utility-function to transfer clinically relevant epilepsy outcomes to health state utilities based on preferences of the general public measured with the TTO method, and secondly, to investigate the impact of the separ ate clinically relevant outcome measures on health state utility. Preferences of the genera l public are used in economic evaluations as policy decisions are often made on societal level. Hence, it is stated within health economics, that the population potentially affe cted by resource allocation decision should be polled, and that the general public is supp osed to value policy decisions with the most benefit for society as a whole.8 In addition it has been demonstrated that 'outsiders' may be more able to differentiate across treatm ent groups than patients are themselves.9 2. Methods 2.1. Study participants Participants from the general population age d >18 years without ep ilepsy were recruited using e-mail, personal communication and social media. A link was provided to participants, which gave access to the online ques tionnaire. As part of this communication, we asked the participants to forward our invitati on to participate in the study to their family and friends (again aged >18, without epilepsy). Participants who did not fully complete the questionnaire were excluded from the analyses. Participants were told that if they decided to complete the questionnaire, they thereby consented to participate in the study. In addition, information was provided that participat ion, and/or forwarding the invitation to friends and family, was completely voluntary and anonymous. This consent procedure was approved by the medical ethical committee of the epilepsy center Kempenhaeghe. 2.2 Attributes and levels Health states were developed based on three clinically impo rtant disease-specific outcome measures (i.e. attributes): seizure frequency, seizure severity and treatment-related side- effects. These attributes were selected based on expert advice and commonality of use within the clinical epilepsy setting. Table 3.1 pr esents the three attributes and their levels. The attribute \"seizure frequency\" comprises 6 levels ranging from no seizures to two seizures per day. The levels of \"seizure severi ty\" were based on the description of seizures Utilities for clinical outcomes in epilepsy 49 3 used in the valuation study of the National Hospital Seizure Severity Scale-3 (NHS3).2 The attribute \"experience of side-effects\" was ca tegorized into three levels: no or mild, moderate and severe side-effects.

The recovery is immediate and there are no after-effects. There are no falls or injuries. Reference Type 2: The attack starts with a fluttering feeling in the stomach, which warns the patient to sit or lie down. The patient then loses awareness for 1/2 a minute during which he smacks his lips. When the attack is over the patient is back to normal within 10 minutes. \u00df6 Type 3: The attack occurs withou t warning, and results in sudden falling to the ground, but the patient recovers within a few seconds. The patient often cuts his head deeply as a result. \u00df7 Type 4: The attack starts withou t warning, and begins with the patient becoming confused, during which he may act oddly like undressing himself or moving objects around; occasionally he is incontinent for urine or falls to the ground. He has never injured himself. The patient then comes ro und, and the recovery normally takes 30 minutes. \u00df8 Seizure severity description Type 5: The attack starts withou t warning, and th e patient always falls unconscious to the floor, and then has a \"grand mal\" convulsion (with shaking of the arms and legs). The patient is often incontinent for urine and always bites his tongue. Full recovery takes 6 hours. \u00df9 Seizure-free No Reference Yes \u00df10 f Level \"No seizures\" is captured by the extra dummy indicator \"Seizure-free\" coded as 0, not seizure-free; 1, seizure-free. c Included in the model as a continuous variable Figure 3.1 Example of a health state description Chapter 3 50 2.3 Valuation exercise Preferences of a sample of th e general population were el icited through a time trade-off (TTO) exercise for each of the epilepsy health states. The TTO was based on a process of outward titration to select a length of time in a health state with full health which they regarded as being equivalent to 10 years in an epilepsy health state. In other words; participants were asked which life they thought would be better, life A or life B (or are the two equivalent)? Life A: living for 10 years with in the presented epilepsy health state; life B: living t=5 years in perfect health . In the case that the participan t prefers life A to life B, t is increased by 1 point (maximum t=10), until the participant be comes indifferent to whether it is life A or life B. The other way around, if a participant prefers life B to life A, t is decreased (minimum t=0), until the participant becomes indifferen t to whether it is life A or life B. The smaller the 'equivalent' number 't ', the worse the epilepsy health state. If a respondent was willing to sacrifice all t year s in full health to avoid a certain epilepsy health state, then the participant valued the epilepsy health state as being equivalent to death. A (nearly) full factorial design was used wh ich resulted, after removing all unrealistic scenario's (i.e. all combinations of \"no se izures\" with \"seizure type\"), in 78 different epilepsy health states. Each participant valued a subset of 10 or 11 epilepsy health states, comprising the mildest possible health state (n o seizures and no to mild side-effects), the worst possible health state (i.e. two seizur es per day, severe side-effects and seizure description 5) and a random subset of 8 or 9 relatively mild, modera te and severe health states (until saturation was reached i.e. 50 values per health state). 2.4 Questionnaire The questionnaire was self-administered using online survey software Qualtrics, version 2013 (Qualtrics, Provo, UT, USA). The first par t of the online questionnaire consisted of socio-economic and background questions/charac teristics: age, gender, educational level and experience with epilepsy (e.g. friend or fa mily with epilepsy). Furthermore, we asked patients whether they believe in life after death, as this might influence their willingness to trade-off life years in the valuating exercise.10 Lastly, participants were asked to desc ribe their own QoL using the EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)11 including a Visual Analogue Scal e (VAS). The second part of the questionnaire started with background informa tion about epilepsy and quality of life. Next, the attributes and levels of epilepsy health states were explained and some example questions were shown as a warm-up exercise for the TTO. The third and final part of the questionnaire consisted of the TTO exercises and questions abo ut the time required by the participants to complete the questionnaire and their experience regarding the difficulty of the TTO exercise. Utilities for clinical outcomes in epilepsy 51 3 2.5 Analyses Utilities (U) were derived by dete rmining the number of life year s one is willing to sacrifice in order to become indifferent with regard to the choice be tween the epilepsy health state (H) scenario ( j) to be valued and t years spent in full health. Afterwards, U is determined as U(H j)=t/10, where t is the time in full health. To account for the nested stru cture of the data (i.e. each respondent evaluated 10 or 11 scenarios), multilevel analyses were performe d to develop the best model for the effects of the three attributes (seizure frequency, seiz ure severity, side-effects) on utility. Thereby, multilevel analyses were used to develop the u tility-function, and to determine the effect of other covariates on the health state valuation of the respondents. We started with a random intercept model to capture inter-individual differences plus an ARMA auto-correlated errors model for the unexplained intra-individu al response variation throughout the trials. To find the best model for the attribute effect s on the utility, several models were compared by likelihood ratio (LR) testing, using maximu m likelihood (ML) estimation. ML estimation is required for LR tests of models di ffering in their fixed/predictor part.12 However, the final model was re-estimated using restricted maxi mum likelihood (REML) estimation to obtain unbiased estimates of standard errors.12 Subsequently, to determine whether partic ipants' religious belief, age, gender, educational level, experience with epilepsy (i.e . a close relative or a friend with epilepsy) and current QoL (EQ-5D and VAS score) sign ificantly impacted the valuation exercise, they were included in the model as covariat es. Multicollinearity of the covariates was assessed by checking if the Variance Infl ation Factor (VIF) was below 10 for every covariate. 2.6 Additional analyses We used the same model for the additional analyses, but now incorporating the utility values derived with the lead time trade-off.13 Only when participants traded off all 10 healthy life years to avoid a certain health state, they were offered the possibility of valuing the health state as being worse than de ath (SWD). In this case, the same scenario was presented using the lead time trade-off a pproach in which the respondent was asked to select a length of time (t) for which one is indifferent between spending t years in full health or spending 5 years in full health followed by 10 year s in the given health state (H j). The corresponding utility is then estimated as U (H j)=(t-5)/(15-5), resulting in a range of - 0.5 to 0 for states worse than death. 3. Results 3.1 Background characteristics In total, 529 subjects from the general popu lation participated in the TTO study. Four participants were excluded from the analyses as their data were incomplete due to a Chapter 3 52 computer error. Therefore, a to tal of 525 participants were included in the analyses. The mean age of the included sample was 43 year s ; m o r e t h a n h a l f ( 5 9 . 5 % ) w e r e w o m e n ; most of them had an educational level of at least secondary vocational education (86.1%) and 61.9% had had no experience with ep ilepsy whatsoever. They valued their own health state, based on the EQ-5D at 0.86 (Dutch tariffs),10 0.84 (UK tariffs)14 and 84.7 (VAS). Of the included participants, 37% indica ted that they believed in life after death (Table 3.2).

In this analysis we treated all th ree attributes as categorical variables to allow any kind of relationship between independ ent and dependent variables. The categories Utilities for clinical outcomes in epilepsy 53 3 \"one seizure per month\", \"no to mild side-e ffects\" and \"type I seizure\" were used as reference categories for, respectively, \"seizu re frequency\", \"experience of side-effects\" and \"seizure severity\", and a dummy indicator was included into the model for every other category of each attribute, plus one extra dummy indicator for abse nce of seizures (to distinguish between absence of seizures and the mildest epilepsy health state, i.e. a type 1 seizure once a month). Then we compared the model fit with that of a simplified model in which all attributes were included in the model as covariates, thus assuming a linear effect of each attribute on the health state evaluation. This resulted in a significantly worse model fit (Likelihood Ratio test: 2=53.823, df=7, p<0.005). However, treating only the attribute \"experience of side- effects\" as a covariate gave a model fit com parable with that of the initial categorical model (2=0.054, df=1, p>0.05). Next, we allowed the effect of the covariate \"experience of side-effects\" to vary randomly between participants, an d this random slope was allowed to covary with the random interc ept. This resulted in a significantly better model fit ( 2=46.039, df=1, p<0.005). Finally, we included interactions between all attributes and then reduced the model by dele ting non-significant inte ractions. This resulted in a model with an interaction between the attributes \"seizure frequency\" and \"seizure severity\", which fitted better than the model without interaction ( 2=65.213, df=16, p<0.005), but at the cost of sixteen additional parameters (4*4). Compared to the plotted mean observed utility values (Figure 3.2a), th e plotted fixed predicted values of this model (Figure 3.2b) look very similar. To invest igate whether the simplified model without interaction is also acceptable, although strict ly speaking significantly worse (which may be due to the large sample size), the fixed pred icted values of the model without interaction are plotted in Figure 3.2c. This shows that this model is also quite acceptable. Although Figure 3.2 suggests that the model can be even further simplified by treating the attributes \"seizure frequency\" and \"seizure severity\" as continuous covariates and thus assuming their effects to be linear, this model was significantly worse than the model behind Figure 3.2c ( 2=55.87, df=6, p<0.005). In relation to the above, it is clinically more relevant to address the attribute \"seizu re severity\" as a categorical rather than continuous predictor, because the successive se izure severity types do not look equidistant clinically,2 and the attribute \"seizure frequency\" was not measured on an equidistant scale. Finally, all other covariates were put into th e model (there was no collinearity, i.e. all VIF<10). Participants' gender, religious belief, educational level, experience with epilepsy and current QoL (EQ-5D and VAS) did not impac t the valuation exercise significantly (all p>0.10). Age was the only characteristic whic h significantly influenced the health state valuation. The older the participant, the more negative the valuation of the health states. T h i s a g e e f f e c t w a s , h o w e v e r , v e r y s m a l l (i.e. 0.001 per year) and the regression coefficients of the attributes hardly change d when age was added to the model. The final model is, therefore, a model with a random intercept, in which \"seizure effects\" is a continuous predictor with a rand om slope, and in which no interactions or other covariates are included (Table 3.3). Chapter 3 54 a b c Figure 3.2 a) Plotted mean observed utility values, b) plotted fixed predicted utility values with interaction, and c) plotted fixed predicted utility values without interaction All attributes significantly affected pat ients' health state valuation (p<0.05). Furthermore, the coefficient of the indicator \"seizure-free\" repres ents the increase in health state value of being seizure-free as compared to having a type 1 seizure once a month (i.e. reference category), keeping side-effects the same. Finally, the constant term can be interpreted as the average utility for a patient with one seizure per month of seizure type 1 and who expe riences no to mild side-effects. The utility- function, including example utility calculations for three hypothetical health states, can be found in Figure 3.3. Furthermore, when l ooking at the total range of impact of each attribute (i.e. difference between \"best\" level an d \"worst\" level), these results indicate that \"seizure type\" has a substantially larger maxi mum effect on health state valuation than \"seizure frequency\" and \"experience of side-effe cts\", and that the latter two attributes have almost the same maximum effect (bearing in mind the coding of experience of side-effects).

The inclusion of SWD results in a slightly higher constant term, and all regression coefficients Chapter 3 56 become larger in absolute terms except for the coefficient, seizure-fr ee. This seems logical as the limit of valuation of a health state in the lead TTO was not 0, but -0.5, as lower boundary. Discussion This study has provided utility values for 78 hea lth states based on thr ee clinically important epilepsy attributes (e.g. seizure frequency, seiz ure severity, side-effects). The results suggest a utility-function that could be used when he alth states, described by seizure frequency, seizure severity and side-effects are available to predict a utility score. In short, our study shows that seizure frequency, seizure severity and side-effect s have a significant impact on QoL. However, looking at the results more cl osely, this study clearly demonstrates that seizure severity has a greater negative impact on utility compared with the attributes seizure frequency and side-effects. It is important that utility values are accu rately assessed. In the absence of accurate values, researchers performing cost-utility anal yses are often forced to guess the utility values for disease states, possibly leading to extreme variability between studies and questionable results. This study provides a utility-function to transform multiple epilepsy health states into utilities valued by a fairly large sample of the general Dutch population and elicited using established methods. As a result this utility-function is suitable for economic evaluations. This study has some limitations that deserv e consideration. Firstly, our sample was a convenience sample, not fully representative of the general Dutch population. The sample consisted of slightly more women, was relati vely young, quite highly educated, and their own quality of life was somewhat lower than that of the general Dutch population. Furthermore, the sample had a variety of experi ence with epilepsy which can also bias the results. Secondly, the TTO exercise was cond ucted via a computerized outward titration method. Although participants could consult the researcher via email or telephone in case of questions/difficulties, there was no in terviewer present during the computerized exercise. Most participants (88.2%) indicate d that they had understood the exercise; however, only 46.1% said the questions were easy. Participants indicated that the health descriptions were clear (87.3%) but that it was sometimes difficult to make a choice between the health states (43.8%), or to become indifferent between the described epilepsy health state and a shorter health stat e in perfect health (45.9%). Most of the participants (88%) needed less than 30 minute s to complete the TTO exercise; only a small number of patients (0.6%) ne eded 1.5 hours. Finally, although most participants indicated that they had understood th e exercise, potential misunderstanding can lead to biased results. Large differences are found betw een studies presenting utility values for epilepsy health states.4-7 This is due to differences in health st ate descriptions, the sample used to value health states (e.g. patients or general po pulation), and the elicitation method used.15 The Utilities for clinical outcomes in epilepsy 57 3 latter issue, is for example also present in our study, although not surprisingly, the coefficients measured with the 'normal' TTO differed from those meas ured with the 'Lead- time' TTO. Obviously, as utilities are used to calculat e QALYs necessary for economic evaluations, they need to be measured in a methodolog ically sound and preferably uniform manner. The recommendation outlined by the IS POR RCT-CEA Task force regarding the measurement of utilities, called for the use of generic preference-based outcome instruments, such as the EuroQol (EQ-5D), or fo r direct utility elicitation methods, such as the standard gamble or time trade-off exercises.1 Despite the growing use of generic preference-based outcome instru ments such as the EQ-5D, there are many clinical studies, which have recorded outcome information on ly in the form of non-preference-based instruments. Likewise, research ers working in the field of ep ilepsy are primarily concerned with measuring symptoms, disease progre ssion and disease-sp ecific QoL and the instruments to do this are generally referred to by economists as non-preference-based measures. On the one hand, using clinically relevant epilepsy outcome measures to calculate utilities, as is done in this study, may have the merit of sensitivity to disease- specific effects of intervention s. On the other hand, the loss of comparability of utilities will fully overrule this gain. As long as there is no over all consensus on the use of utilities and how to measure them, it will remain a real challenge to deal w ith this issue properly. Therefore, the use of utilities derived from clinically relevant outc ome measures for cost-utility analyses is warranted only under strict conditions. Because of the difference in scope of both methods, utility values derived from clinical outcom e measures are not comparable with those derived from a generic preference-based QoL instrument, even though they appear to lie on the same scale (0 to 1). The development of a utility-function bridging the gap between clinically relevant outcome measures and ut ilities is valuable for research purposes, although there is concern about the application of our results in economic evaluations. First of all, when health states in a preference elicitation study sole ly consist of clinical outcome measures, rather than general items of QoL, focusing effects may occur.16,17 The context of the valuation exercise is namely more specif ic, and therefore an exaggeration of health problems may occur, which will be reflected by lower utilities. Secondly, and in contrast to the previous statement, an upward bias of utility scores may occur, as the focus of clinical measures is solely on the phys iological aspects of the diseas e itself, therefore, capturing co-morbidities and/or psychological as pects of the disease might be difficult.16,17 Thirdly, developing a utility-function fr om clinical outcome measures to utilities is not a clear-cut exercise. Decisions made may vary per study and will, therefore, hamper comparability between studies.18,19 Conclusions This study provides a utility-function for epile psy health states and gives insight into the relative impact of clinical outcomes in epileps y on QoL. The possible increase in sensitivity Chapter 3 58 of outcome measures by using our utility-f unction comes at the price of a loss of comparability with other utilities. We, therefore, advise only using these utility values (or others) in economic evaluations when quality of life is not dire ctly measured in a study and hence, no health state utilities are availabl e, or when there is convincing empirical evidence of the insensitivity of a generic Qo L-instrument within the field of epilepsy. Furthermore, when doing so, explicitly stat e the imposed bias, as using these disease- specific utilities may come at the cost of co mparability with other utility values within and across medical conditions and diseases. Finally, it is worth stating that all forms of translation-methods are always 'second best', and the existence of these techniques should not be taken as an argument to rely on th em instead of obtainin g utilities via generic preference-based QoL measurements in prospectively designed studies.

Chapter 3 61 Mapping of the QOLIE-31P to EQ-5D-5L utilities and comparison of the responsiveness of both instruments in epilepsy B.F.M. Wijnen I. Mosweu Kinderen S.M.A.A. Evers P. McCrone Submitted to European Jour nal of Health Economics Chapter 4 62 Abstract Objective To investigate the responsiveness of and correlation between the EQ-5D-5L and the QOLIE-31P in patients with epilepsy, and develop a mapping function to predict EQ-5D- 5L values based on the QOLIE-31P for use in economic evaluations. Methods The dataset was derived from two clinical trials, the ZMILE study in th e Netherlands and the SMILE study in the UK. In both studies, patients' quality of life using the EQ-5D-5L and QOLIE- 31P was measured at baseline and 12 months follow-up. Spearman's correlations, effect sizes (EF) and standardized re sponse means (SRM) were calculated for both the EQ-5D-5L and QOLIE-31P domains and sub scores. Mapping functions were derived using ordinary least square (OLS) and censored least absolute deviations models. Results A total of 509 patients were included in this study. Moderately strong significant correlations were found between both instruments. The EQ- 5D-5L showed high ceiling effects and small EFs and SRMs, whereas the QOLIE-31P did not show ceiling effects and also showed small to moderate EFs and SRMs. Results of the different mapping functions indicate that the highest adjusted R2 we were able to regress was 0.265 using an OLS model with squared terms, leading to a mean absolute error of 0.103. Conclusion Results presented in this study emphasize the importance of the development of condition- specific preference-based instruments which can be used within the QALY framework, and hence incorporated as an important supplement in economic evaluations. Development of such instruments may ensure that the benefits of health-care interventi ons are more adequately reflected in QALY estimates. Responsiveness & mapping of EQ-5D and QOLIE-31P 63 4 Introduction Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain, characte rized by recurrent seizures. Seizure episodes are a result of excessive electrical discharges in a group of brain cells. Different parts of the brain can be the site of such discharges. Thes e discharges result in a variety of clinical manifestations, depending on where they occur in the brain. The clinical manifestations can vary from the briefest lapses of attentio n or muscle jerks to severe and prolonged convulsions.1 In economic evaluation, both in general and in the field of epilepsy, the quality adjusted life year (QALY) is routinely used as a summa ry measure of health outcome for economic evaluations, which incorporates the impact on bo th the quantity and quality of life (QoL). For example, the use of QALYs is required by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales2 and the Healthcare ins titute in the Netherlands3 for an intervention to be reimbursed. The utilit y part of QALYs requires health state values as QALYs are calculated based on the time spen t in a specific health state multiplied by the corresponding utility of that health state. Co mmonly used measures to include in the QALYs are generic utility measures, such as the EuroQol 5 dimensions 5 levels (EQ-5D-5L),4,5 Short Form 6 dimensions (SF-6D)6 and the Health Utility Index (HUI).7 Generic utility instruments are designed to be applicab le in a large variety of conditions. However, there are instances, especially in clinical resear ch were some generic utility measures fail to capture change s that, even if small, are impo rtant to patients. Some studies use condition-specific or condition-specific utility measures to address this limitation. It is suggested that these instruments are likely to be more responsive than generic instruments, whose strengths include breadth and applic ability across conditions and interventions.8 The responsiveness of an instrument is likely to be dependent on several factors such as the nature of the condition and the domains incl uded in the instrume nt. For example, the EuroQOl-5D-3L (i.e. a generic utility instru ment) has been demonstrated to correlate moderately to good with criterion measur es in patients with chronic low back pain.9 In contrast, the EQ-5D-3L was d eemed unsuitable for people with dementia, leading to the development of a condition-specific questionnaire (DEMQOL).10 In epilepsy, the EQ-5D- 3L has been shown to correlate well with an other generic quality of life instrument, the 15D-instrument.11 However, in patients with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy, the EuroQol- 5D-3L was compared to an epilepsy-specif ic instrument (NEWQOL-6D) and was shown to be less responsive than the NEWQOL-6D.12 Selai et al.13 examined the use of the EQ- 5D-3L in people with epilepsy and concluded that adaptation, seizures, and the stigma of epilepsy considerably impair quality of life but are not captured using the EQ-5D-3L, which limit its applicability.13 Wiebe et al.8 evaluated 43 randomized controlled trials which used generic and specific QoL instruments and concluded that specific in struments are more responsive than generic tools. Furthermore, they stress that investigators may come to misleading conclusions by using generic instruments. However, condit ion-specific measures lack cross program comparability. Furthermore, if a condition-specif ic quality of life instrument were used for Chapter 4 64 the calculation of QALYs, the valuation set should be constructed according to the same principles as generic utility measures (i.e. the multi attribute utility theory14), which is often not the case. An alternative option would be to derive well-conducted and validated mapping functions to map condition-specific outcomes to generic utilities. A mapping function is a regression equation used to predic t values of, in this case, a generic utility instrument, using scores/values from a conditio n-specific instrument as regressors (also known as 'cross-walking').15 Albeit not resolving issues re garding insensitivity of generic instruments, mapping is a solution which enables health state utilities to be predicted when no preference-based measure ha s been included in the study.15,16 Such mapping functions are supposed to yield utility valu es comparable generic instruments.16 However, the performance of a mapping function is depend ent on and requires a degree of overlap between both measures and that the two measures are administered on the same population15,17 The aim of this study is to com pare the EQ-5D-5L and an often used condition-specific QoL instrument, the Quality of Life in Epilepsy-Patients-Weighted 31p (QOLIE-31P).18 The objective of this study is to investigate the responsiveness of and correlation between the EQ-5D-5L and the QOLIE-31P in patients with epilepsy. In addition, we aim to develop a mapping function to predict EQ-5D-5L values based on the QOLIE-31P for use in economic evaluations. Methods QOLIE-31P The QOLIE-31-P is a condition-specific QoL inst rument which consists of 38 items assessing 7 domains of epilepsy: seizure worry, overall QOL, emotional well-being, energy-fatigue, cognitive functioning including memory, medica tion effects, social functioning and an overall score. In addition, for each domain , questions regarding how much distress a person feels about problems and worries relate d to epilepsy are included. Each domain is scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 100. Afte rwards a final score can be calculated using weights derived from the amount of distress re lated to each domain. The final score ranges from 0 to 100, in which higher values indicate a better QoL.19 EQ-5D-5L The EQ-5D-5L is a generic QoL instrument which consists of five dimensions: mobility, self- care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxi ety/depression, each of which can have one of five responses4,5 (e.g. no pain, slight pain, moderate pain, severe pain and extreme pain). This measure produces a possible 3125 distinct health states ranging from 11111 (full health) to 55555 (worst). The EQ-5D-5L was valued using both the Dutch and the UK tariffs.5,20,21 Responsiveness & mapping of EQ-5D and QOLIE-31P 65 4 Data set The SMILE study data22,23 and the ZMILE study data24 were used for the analyses. Both studies examined the (cost-) effectiveness of a self-management program for patients with epilepsy. Follow-up data was available for 12 months in both studies. Inclusion criteria for both studies were similar. However, the SMIL E study included patients from age 16 years whereas the ZMILE study includ ed patients aged 18 years. Patients with complete data for each of the measures across each time point were included. For the direct response mapping, the data set was randomly split (using the \"approximately 50% of the cases\"-function in SPSS) into two separate data sets: 1) the \"estimation sample\" (N=283), which was used to derive the mapping functions; 2) the \"validation sample\" (N=224) which was used to validate the mapping functions. Responsiveness analyses Descriptive analyses are presented for patien t characteristics. To measure concurrent validity (i.e. the strength of the relations hip between measures of the same concept) Spearman's correlation was calculated between the domains and total scores of the EQ- 5D-5L and the QOLIE-31P. Spearm an's correlation was used due to the skewed nature of the data, especially EQ-5D-5L values. Strong correlations indicate that the preference- based measures are assessing related constr ucts. Correlations are considered weak if scores are less than 0.3, moderate if scores are between 0.3 and less than 0.7, and strong if scores are 0.7 or higher.25 Bonferroni correction was applied to account the p-values for multiple testing.26 To determine the predictive valid ity or responsiveness of both instruments (i.e. the ability of an instrument to detect relevant change s in QoL over time) th e Standardized Response Mean (SRM) and effect size (EF) were calc ulated. The SRM is a standard indicator of change across measures and time points an d was calculated by SRM = (M1-M2)/(SD1- SD2), whereas M1 is the mean pre-assessment and the M2 is the mean post assessment and SD1 and SD2 are the standard de viations of both assessments.25 SRMs of less than 0.2 are considered small, 0.5 moderate, and 0.8 large.25,27 The EF is calculated as the difference between follow-up and baseline di vided by the standard deviation of the group's baseline scores. The SRM and EF we re calculated for those patients amongst whom a change in health state was observed between baseline and follow-up. Floor and ceiling effects were examined. For each questio nnaire the proportion of respondents with a minimum score (referred to as 'floor effects') or a maximum score (referred to as 'ceiling effects') was calculated. If a large proportion of the population is at the floor (lowest possible score) or ceiling (hig hest possible score), then this impairs the ability of the measure to pick up decreases or increases in QoL, respectively.12 The ES and the SRM are the most common measures for responsivene ss. Positive values reflect (standardized) improvements in the number of standard deviations of the base line scores (ES) or the score differences (SRM) (i.e. unit-free).28 Chapter 4 66 Mapping approach To estimate EQ-5D-5L utility scores based on the QOLIE-31P, dire ct response mapping was used to regress QOLIE-31P scores to EQ-5D-5L scores. In direct mapping, a regression equation is used to predict the values of the EQ-5 D-5L using scores/values from the QOLIE-31P as regressors. Ne xt, the coefficients of the model are used to carry out the conversion from the source measure to th e target measure in the required dataset.29 Spearman's correlations of the independent variables were used to determine whether there was collinearity between independent variables, which wo uld then be removed from the analyses. A collinearity threshold of >0.70 was used.30 Ordinary least-squares (OLS) and Censored least absolute deviations (CLAD) regression was used as to estimate the mode l. The OLS is the most commonly used model in mapping studies.15,31 However, it is unable to restrict for the range of values and may lead to implausible predicted values (e.g. EQ-5D values above 1). The CLAD model was therefore used as it has the ability to account for censored or bounded data. In addition, it is robust to heteroscedasticity and can also be used for skewed data.15,32 As the aim of this study was to derive a predictive model, all items (domains) were included in the model despite their significan ce level, which is often considered best practice.33-35 Furthermore, no attempt was made to pred ict the individual EQ-5D-5L dimensions separately as this has been shown to be a less e fficient strategy or to give similar results in terms of prediction.36 For both the OLS and the CLAD model, spec ifications of the mapping functions were constructed as proposed by Brazier et al. (2010).15 We started with a simple additive model by predicting EQ-5D values from the total QOLIE-31P scores including age, gender, employment, and living arrangements (m odel 1). Next, the EQ-5D-5L values were predicted from the 7 QOLIE-31P dimension sub scores (model 2). To relax the assumptions of the simple additive model, squared terms fo r dimension sub scores were included in the model (model 3).15 As suggested by Brazier et al. (2 010) only significant squared terms were included in the model to reduce the number of variables.15 The predictive validity of the mapping models was assessed by using: 1) the goodness of fit as assessed using adjusted/pseudo R-squared (OLS and CLAD) in the estimation sample; and 2) the predictive performance of the models in the validation sample was assessed using the mean absolute error (MAE). All analyses were done in STATA 15 (S tataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Results The dataset consisted of 509 patients of whic h 102 patients were recruited for the ZMILE study and 407 for the SMILE study. In total, 53.0% of the patients were female and the majority of the patients were aged between 25 and 44 years old. Most of the patients had a household or lived with others (73.1%) and 51.3% of the patients were unemployed. Responsiveness & mapping of EQ-5D and QOLIE-31P 67 4 Mean quality of life according to the EQ -5D-5L was 0.86 and mean condition-specific quality of life according to the QOLIE-31P was 65.82. More detail regarding the characteristics of the population(s ) is reported in Table 4.1.

Only a few statistically significant correlations were fo und between the sub scor es of the QOLIE-31P and the sub scores of the EQ-5D-5L. All su bscores of the QOLIE-31P did significantly correlate with the total EQ-5D-5L scores. At baseline and 12 months follow-up ceiling effects on the EQ-5D-5L were substantial with 37.8% and 33.5% of the patients reporting the maximum score. No ceiling effect s were found for the QOLIE-31P. Details regarding the EF and SRM are pres ented in Table 4.3. EFs and SRMs, all appear to be relatively small. Both the EF and SRM estimate s are smaller for the EQ-5D-5L than the QOLIE-31P. For the EQ-5D-5L, values range from -0.017 to 0.043 for the EF and from -0.023 to 0.025 for the SRM which wo uld be considered small. The EF and SRM values for the QOLIE-31P range from 0.082 to 0.290 (EF) and from 0.07 to 0.270 (SRM), which would be regarded as small to moderate.

Mapping functions The EQ-5D index scores had a somewhat bimo dal distribution, and the QOLIE-31P index scores were normally distributed (see Suppleme ntal Figure S4.1). Th e inclusion of age was shown to have a significant effect on the prediction of EQ-5D-5L scores. All other demographic variables were excluded from the analyses. In addition, there was a significant effect associated with country (i .e. SMILE- or ZMILE-dataset). Hence, age and country were included in all mapping function. For the OLS mapping functions, model 3 perf ormed best with an MAE of 0.103 and an adjusted R2 of 0.265. Inclusion of age significan tly improved the model, hence a model without age was only constructed for OLS. Fo r the CLAD mapping functions, CLAD model 3 performed best with a MAE of 0.097 and a pseudo R2 of 0.160. It should be noted, however, that including squared term s did only improve adjusted/pseudo R2 values and only marginally improved MAE in the estim ation sample (see Table 4.4). All models predicted values above 1 (full health), of which OLS model 2 was closest to 1 with Responsiveness & mapping of EQ-5D and QOLIE-31P 69 4 maximum values of 1.020.

Given the higher adjusted/pseudo R2 values of model 3 compared to model 1 for both OLS and CLAD, and give the lower MAE for OLS model 3 compared to CLAD model 3 in the validation sample, the best m apping function would be OLS model 3.

Lookin g at concurrent validity, although the correlations were significant, the strength was only moderate between both instruments when looking at the total score. This may imply that both inst ruments are only measuring the same concept to some extent an d impose conceptual differences. The EQ-5D-5L showed substantially high ceili ng effects and was demonstrated to have rather small EFs and SRMs whereas the QOLIE -31P did not show ce iling effects and had small to moderate EFs and SRMs. This indicate s that the QOLIE-31P has an overall higher responsiveness based on EF, SRM and ceiling effects. Furthermore, this study provides a mapping function which can be used in (future) economic evaluations to map QOLIE-31P data to EQ-5D-5L values. The relatively small EFs and SRMs may be ex plained by a lack of responsiveness of both instruments, especially the EQ-5D-5L. Ho wever, part of these small estimates can be explained by the fact that the patients' health state did not change much over time. The EF and SRM were calculated in all patients who h ad any change during follow-up, due to the Responsiveness & mapping of EQ-5D and QOLIE-31P 71 4 lack of a known clinically meaningful differ ence for both instruments, this led to an underestimation of the EF and SRM. The EQ -5D-5L, however, performed substantially worse than the QOLIE-31P. Using different mapping functions, the highest adjusted R2 we were able to regress was 0.265 using an OLS model with squared terms, wh ich led to a MAE of 0.103. Overall, this model performed best given the results wi thin the estimation and validation sample. Although theoretically preferred, the use of a CLAD model did not perform better than the OLS model, especially in the validation samp le. Mixed results have been reported in studies using CLAD models,17 with some concluding that CLAD improved the model fit37,38 and others concluding that the improvement of CLAD over OLS was small or did not have an impact.39 The adjusted/pseudo R2 values found in this study were relatively small, which is not uncommon. In a review of Brazier et al. (2010), it was found that models mapping a generic instrument onto a generic preferen ce-based measure achieved an adjusted R2 of more than 0.5 within sample. However, in studies examining the fit of functions mapping from condition-specific to gene ric measures, results were more variable ranging from 0.17 to 0.51.15 In addition, errors were often larger for models mapping a generic measure onto a generic preference-based measure.15,17 Likewise, the usefulness of our mapping function in economic evaluations is question able given the relatively large mean absolute error and poor model fit. Another way of mapping would be to use a mo del to predict responses of each of the five dimensions of the EQ-5D-5L from the QOLIE-31P (sub) scores, so called indirect response mapping or response mapping models.40 As the purpose of the mapping part of this study was to derive a regression function, this method was not applied. In addition, as mentioned above, indirect response mapping has been shown to be a less efficient strategy or to give similar results in terms of prediction.36 The use of mapping to derive EQ-5D-5L valu es is fundamentally limited by the degree of overlap between two instruments.17 Although several studies reported limitations with generic preference-based quality of life in struments regarding their responsiveness and ability to discriminate between health states (e.g. McTaggart-Cowan et al.41), the use of generic preference-based instruments is ma ndatory in most national guidelines for pharmaco-economic evaluatio ns, for example in the UK and the Netherlands.3,42 However, given the limited respon siveness, low correlations, an d the poor model fit of the mapping functions it may be argued that there is a need for the development of condition- specific preference-based measures. Genera l (non-preference based) condition-specific instruments, such as the QOLIE-31P, are an im portant source of evidence, however, their use in economic evaluation is severely limited because they were not designed for this purpose and, unless they are preference-based , they theoretically cannot be used to calculate quality adjusted life years (QALYs).14,43 Several attempts have been made to derive condition-specific quality of life instru ments to calculate (condi tion-specific) QALYs, such as the development of new instruments44,45 or the development of condition-specific preference-based measures from existing instruments.46,47 Of course, such a measure could not be the sole outcome of interest fo r economic evaluations, as they lack the Chapter 4 72 comparability between conditions, a dist inct advantage of generic instruments.48 We agree with Brazier et al. (2010), that develo pment of a condition-specific preference- based instrument should not be seen as an alternative to generic preference-based measures, but rather as a supplement.43 Condition-specific prefer ence-based instruments may have an important role in ensuring that the benefits of health -care interventions are adequately reflected in QALY estimates fo r economic evaluations in all conditions.49 This study is subject to several limitations. Fi rst, we only investigated the use of a few mapping models, whereas a wide variety of models exists such as GLM of Tobit models. However, given the marginal differences between the models used in this study, the model fit is not likely to be improved substantially. Second, our estimations are based on a pooled data set containing data from both the UK and the Netherlands. Although inclusion criteria for both studies were similar and there was no significant difference between the countries regarding regression estimates, this may have introduced extra hete rogeneity within the data. Lastly, the pooled dataset was divided in an estimation sample and a validation sample. This has the advantage that it assesse s the mapping function by its prime purpose; however, it reduces the sample size of the es timation sample. The use of the whole sample for the model estimations, however, did not substantially improve the model(s). Conclusion There was a low to moderate correlation be tween the EQ-5D-5L and the QOLIE-31P. Both the EF and SMRs were relatively low, especi ally for the EQ-5D-5L. Mapping functions to regress QOLIE-31P values to EQ-5D-5L values did not show an optimal fit with relatively low adjusted R2 values. The results presented in this study may emphasize the importance of the development of condition-specific prefer ence-based instruments which can be used within the QALY framework and hence incorporated as an important supplement in economic evaluations. The de velopment of such condition- specific preference-based quality of instruments can ensure that the benefits of health-care interventions are adequately reflected in QALY estimates for ec onomic evaluations not only in epilepsy but for all conditions.

Wijnen* Pharmacoeconomics 2016; 34(12), 11951209 * both authors contributed equally Chapter 5 78 Abstract Introduction Best-worst scaling (BWS) is becoming increasingly popular to elicit preferences in health care. However, little is known about current practice and trends in the use of BWS in health care. This study aims to identify, review and critically appraise BWS in health care, and to identify trends over time in key aspects of BWS. Methods A systematic review was conducted, using MEDLINE (via PubMed) and EMBASE to identify all English language BWS studies available in print or online until April 2016. Two reviewers independently selected articles, systematically extracted data using a predefined extraction sheet and critically appraised the study quality using the Purpose, Respondents, Explanation, Findings, Signicance (PREFS) checklist. Trends over time periods (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015) were further assessed. Results A total of 62 BWS were identified of which 26 were BWS object case, 29 were BWS profile case, and 7 were BWS multi-profile case. About two- thirds of studies were performed in the last two years. Decreasing sample sizes and number of factors in BWS object case, as well as the use of less complicated analytic methods was observed in recent studies. The quality of BWS studies is generally acceptable according to the PREFS checklist, except that most studies did not indicate whether the responders were similar to non-responders. Conclusion The use of BWS object case and BWS profile case has drastically increased in health care, especially in the last two years. In contrast with previous DCE reviews, ther e is an increasing use of less sophisticated analytic methods. Using best-worst scaling to investigate preferences in health care 79 5 1. Background Investigating preferences has beco me popular in health care. In recent years, the need for a more patient-centred approach in health care and health technology assessment has been widely acknowledged. Hence, it is expe cted that eliciting preferences will become increasingly important to support he alth policy and c linical decisions.1,2 In order to enhance the patient-centred approach, preferen ces may be elicited from patients or other key players in the health sector such as c linicians and policy makers on how they value various aspects of health interventions or when designing and ev aluating health care programs.3 By eliciting preferences of other key pl ayers in health sector, one may identify potential discrepancies between the stakehol ders, which may be addressed to enhance patient-centred health care.4 Preference studies can provide relevant information to support health technology assessment and decisi ons about priorities in health care.5 A better understanding of patients' pr eferences for treatment and in volving patients in clinical decision making could also help to op timize disease management and medication adherence. Several methods have been de veloped and used to assess pr eferences in health care, ranging from simple rating scale exercises to more complex forms of preference valuation techniques such as co njoint analysis. Conjoi nt analysis is a decomposition method that derive the implicit values for factors (or attrib utes and levels) from some overall score for a profile consisting of two or more factors.6,7 In particular, the use of traditional discrete- choice experiments (DCEs), has drastically increased in recent years.2,8 Although DCEs may take many forms, this study refers solely to the 'traditional' DCE in which a respondent typically chooses one alternative among a nu mber of competing multi-profile options described by varied factors. Another type of conjoint analysis, namely best-worst scaling (BWS), is becoming increasingly popular in healthcare.9 BWS devised by Finn and Louviere,10 first applied in health care by Szei nbach et al. in which it was named a maximum difference conjoint analysis11 and formally introduced to health care research by McIntosh and Louviere,12 differs from traditional DCEs, mainly because it elicits additional information on the least preferred option.13 BWS consists of choice tasks, with a minimum of 3 items/options, in which a person is asked to indicate the best and the worst item/option, with the overall aim to obtain a fu ll ranking of items in a manner that is easy for respondents and can then be analysed in various ways.9 As health care applications of BWS emerged on ly recently, it is impo rtant to reflect on and assess current practice. Several re views of DCEs have been conducted14,15 and revealed trends toward the conduct and the use of DCEs. For BWS studies, although not systematically reported, scholars noted its increasing popularity in health care.13,16 Yet, little is known about current practice and trends in the use of BWS in health care, except from two recent overview articles of BWS studies of M\u00fchlbacher et al.17,18 These articles provide insights into the possibilities of applica tion, the theoretical concepts underlying the BWS method, analytic method s, strengths and weakness of BWS cases and the list of studies that applied the BWS me thod. However, these studies do not report on the current Chapter 5 80 practice per BWS cases, on the quality apprais al of BWS studies, and on trends of BWS studies in health care. Reviewing the use of BWS and reflecting on current practice could help in improving best practic es of BWS and potentially lead to an increased interest of policy makers or physicians to the wide usab ility and value of BWS. Hence, we conducted a systematic review to identify and analyse all BWS conducted in health care, and to identify if key aspects of BW S have changed over time. 2. Best worst scaling BWS can be used to determine preferences for a wide range of health care questions, by asking the respondent to indicate the best and the worst in a set of available items or options. There are three types of BWS that diffe r in the complexity of the items or options under considerations: the BWS object case (or case 1) the BWS profile case (or case 2), and the BWS multi-profile case (or case 3).16 In the BWS object case, the researcher is in terested in the relative values associated with each of a list of objects. Figure 5.1a illu strates the case of three relevant attributes. Once the researcher has chosen the list of obje cts, the researcher presents choice sets of these to respondents to obtain best and worst data. Here th e objects are not decomposed into factors. BWS object case can be used, for instance, to examine features of a new medicine. Hence, one needs to develop a list of mutually exclusive objects.19 The object case BWS can be very attractive in health care because health ca re goods/services can be complicated and even pairs of specifications (e.g. a simple DCE) may lead to unacceptable cognitive burden, particul arly among vulnerable patient groups.16 In the BWS profile case, in cont rast with BWS object case, the level of each attribute is shown and the choice set has the structure of a single profile. In Figure 5.1b a possible treatment is characterised by five attributes , providing its levels in each choice-set. However, the respondent is not required to consider the value of the profile as a whole, but has to consider the factor levels that descri be it, and choose the one that is best (most attractive) and the one that is worst (least attractive). Hence, profiles must describe particular configurations or specifications of a good or service, in which each profile represents a combination of factors and associated levels.19 The factors are fixed across all profiles but the combinations of factor levels differ by profile. In contrast to BWS profile case, the BWS mu lti-profile case provides multiple profiles and the respondent is asked to choose the best (most attractive) profile as well as the worst (least attractive) one in the current choice set. Figure 5.1c illustrates a choice set, using again a possible treatment as an example. Re spondents base their choice on the whole scenario instead of single factor levels as in BWS profile case The multiple profiles include all the factors and one level per factor and th e respondent is assumed to make deliberate choices based on presented leve ls for each factor. The BWS multi-profile case is most similar to a traditional DCE but extends the ge neral DCE design to allow for best and worst choices.19 Using best-worst scaling to investigate preferences in health care 81 5 Least important Factors of medicine Most important X Side-effects Frequency of intake X Mode of administration Figure 5.1a Example of a BWS object case Least important Factors of medicine Most important Side effects: moderate Frequency of intake: daily Mode of administration: oral supplement X X Out-of-pocket expenses: \u20ac10 per week Duration of treatment: eight weeks Figure 5.1b Example of a BWS profile case Factors Drug A Drug B Drug C Side effects: Moderate Severe Severe Frequency of intake: Daily Monthly Monthly Mode of administration: Oral supplement Injection Injection Out-of-pocket expenses: \u20ac10 per week \u20ac15 per week \u20ac5 per week Duration of treatment: Eight weeks Twelve weeks Four weeks Which drug would be the best treatment for you?

Methods 3.1 Literature search A systematic review was conducted, usin g MEDLINE (via PubMed) and EMBASE to identify all English language BWS studies av ailable in print or online between January 1990 and April 2016. In additi on, bibliographies of BWS appl ications identified in the literature search were manually searched (f orward and backward) for additional articles. Following examples of DCE reviews from Ryan et al.2 and Clark et al.,14 the search strategy was formulated according to free text terms. The following free text terms focusing on BWS studies were used individually in each database: 'object 'BWS' OR (see Electronic Supplementary Material S5.1). The research team discussed and approved the list of free text terms. In addition, we have cross-checke d the identified articles with the articles identified by a recent review of M\u00fchlbacher et al.17 Chapter 5 82 3.2 Selection of studies Titles and abstracts were screened independen tly by two researchers (KLC & BW). Studies were included if they were original BWS st udies, published as a full text article, and applied to health care. The defi nition of Louviere et al.19 was used for inclusion of BWS studies, meaning only BWS stud ies were included in which re spondents needed to indicate both a best and worst option per choice-task. Hence, studies looking at best or worst alternatives only as well as studies using only best data to estimate models were excluded. Furthermore, studies based on simulated data were excluded. Disagreements about inclusion or exclusion based on abstract review w e r e d e t e r m i n e d b y c o n s e n s u s . A t l e a s t two independent reviewers (KLC, BW, ILH, EJ) th en reviewed the full text of all remaining articles. Consensus on study inclusion was reached by at least two reviewers. 3.3 Data extraction For each article that met our inclusion criteri a, two independent reviewers (KLC & EJ, and BW & ILH) systematically extracted data using a predefined extraction form that included a variety of data elements relevant to the co nduct of BWS experiments. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus. This data extr action form was based on a review by De Bekker et al.20 on DCE and was further developed thro ugh discussion within the research team. A pilot study was performed by four re viewers for four studies which led to some adjustments to the data extraction form. The extracted data included three categories: general study information, design and choice sets and estimation procedure and validity. General study information included: authors, ye ar of publication, study name, study type, study setting, target population, type of case , and area of application. Design and choice sets included: sample size, methods for factor selection, type of BWS, design of BWS, domains of BWS factors, number of best-worst options per choice set, number of included factors, maximum number of choice tasks, nu mber of factors per ch oice task, BWS survey administration, and BWS survey method. Es timation procedure and validity included: analytical method, use of software package s to analyse BWS experiments, preference heterogeneity taken into account (by mean s of latent class or random parameters analyses), subgroup analysis, use of pilot validity checks (i.e. test-retest, face validity of a dominant choice or subgroup analysis). 3.4 Quality assessment In order to assess the study quality, the Purp ose, Respondents, Explanation, Findings, Signicance (PREFS) checklist21 was used. The PREFS was specifically developed based on guidelines for conjoint analyses, patient report ed outcomes and randomiz ed trials to assess studies reporting on factors that could influenc e the validity of findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only ch ecklist available for estimatin g the quality of preference studies.21 PREFS assesses five criteria as acceptable (1) or unacceptable (0): purpose of the study (is the purpose of the study in relati on to preferences clearl y stated?); respondent Using best-worst scaling to investigate preferences in health care 83 5 sampling (are the responders similar to the non-responders?); explan ation of preference assessment methods (are meth ods of assessing preferences clearly explained?); ndings reported for total sample (were all responde nts included in the reported findings and analysis of preference results?); and signica nce testing (were significance tests used to assess the preference results?). The five crite ria are summed to indicate an overall quality score ranging from 0 to 5. Studies were independently scored by two reviewers and disagreements were resolved by consensus in pairs of two researchers (KLC & EJ, and BW & IH). 3.5 Data analysis Extracted data were grouped by BWS cases. A dditionally, for several items (sample size, number of included factors, ma ximum number of choice tasks, number of factors per choice task and analytical method), we reported medians and ranges for different time periods (i.e. 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 2014 and 2015) to investigate potential trends. Extracted data are presented in tables, sepa rately for the three different BWS cases. 4. Results 4.1 Article inclusion Initial database searches resulted in 632 ar ticles (538 from Pubmed and 94 from EMBASE). This corresponded to 588 unique stud ies of which 69 were e ligible for full text review. Full text review resulted in the exclusio n of 11 studies as six studies did not perform a BWS experiment, one study had no applicat ion in health care, two studies were not original research, one study included thinking aloud (qualitative) results only, and another study did not report on the results. Figure 5.2 shows the flow chart of the article identification process. 4.2 General study information A total of 62 BWS studies were identified (58 articles) of which 26 were BWS object case studies, 29 were BWS profile case studies, an d seven were BWS multi-profile case studies. Results indicated an increase in the number of BWS object case and BWS profile case studies applied in health care over time (see Figure 5.3). The median number of participants was 175 for BWS object case, 162 for BWS profile case, and 326 for BWS multi-profile case. Most studies were conducte d in the United States (67%) for BWS object case, and in Australia (36%) and United Kin gdom (32%) for BWS profile case (see Table 5.1).

MNL: Multinomial logistic regression. Max Diff: Maximum difference scaling. NR: Not reported. NA: Not applicable 4.3 Design and choice sets Looking at current practice regarding designs an d choice sets used in BWS studies, most BWS studies selected factors (attributes and le vels) using literature reviews (BWS object case 33%; BWS profile case 35%; and BWS mu lti-profile case 50%) and/or qualitative methods such as interviews and focus groups (BWS object case 55%; BWS profile case 59%; and BWS case 25%). For BWS object case, the median number of factors was 12 while the average number of fa ctors in BWS profile case (defined as the number of levels included in the experiment) was 18. For the BWS multi-profile case the median number of factors was 14. The median number of choice sets for BWS object case was 13, for BWS profile case 16, and BWS mult i-profile case 11. Almost all studies only asked one best and one worst option. Only one study (BWS multi-profile case) asked respondents to identify two best and tw o worst choices for each choice set.22 In most studies, the survey was administrated in a self-completion format (BWS object case 74%; case 72%; and BWS mu lti-profile case 71%) and many studies used an online platform (BWS object case 48%; BWS profile case 41%; and BWS multi-Chapter 5 90 profile case 29%). The most used design by fa r is the balanced incomplete block design for BWS object case (54%), and the orthogonal main effects design for BWS profile case (66%) and BWS multi-profile case (43%). Howe ver, some studies did not report on their design (BWS object case 15%; BWS profile case 7%; and BWS multi-profile case 14%). 4.4 Estimation procedure and validity As shown in Table 5.2, BWS object case studies most often employed Hierarchical Bayes (21%) and simple summary statistics (32%). BW S profile case and BWS multi-profile case studies used the multinomial logistic (MNL ) model (in 47% and 63% of the studies respectively). Several studies did not report on the software used for analyses (BWS object case 50%; for BWS profile case 34%; and BWS multi-profile case 57%). Of those that reported the software used for analysis, Sawt ooth software was most frequently used for BWS object case (27%), while ST ATA software was most frequently used in the analyses of BWS profile case (31%) and SAS was most freq uently reported in the BWS multi-profile case studies (29%). Most studies did not take into account heterogene ity (BWS object case 68%; BWS profile case 66%; and BWS multi-profile case 57%). To validate the factors, a pilot study was used for 15 BWS object case studies (58%), 16 BWS profile case studies (55%), and 3 BWS multi-profile case studies (43%). In addition, a large majority of BWS studies conducted no validity checks (BWS object case 81%; BWS profile case 76%; and BWS multi-profile case 71%). 4.5 Trend analysis Table 5.3 depicts the trend analysis, which in dicated a decreasing median sample size since 2013 for BWS object case, from n=367 in 2013 to n=151 in articles published in 2015. For BWS profile case and BWS multi-profile case, the trends are not so clear which is also depicted in the large range around the median. Moreover, there appears to be a decrease in the median number of factors in cluded in BWS object case studies since 2013. For the BWS profile case a similar trend was found since 2011. For BWS multi-profile case, the trend is not so clear. For BWS profile case, a decrease in the median number of factors per choice task was found since 20 13. No trends can be found regarding the median number of choice tasks and the median number of factors per choice task in BWS studies. However, looking at the maximum valu es of the number of choice tasks for BWS profile there seems to be a slight increase from 2010 onwards. Trends of the analytical methods are depicted in Figure 5.4a, 5.4b, an d 5.4c. There is a steep increase in the use of best-minus worst counting and Hierarchical Bayes for BW S object case studies (see Figure 5.4a). For the BWS profile case, a stee p increase was observed in the use of MNL models (see Figure 5.4b). Regarding BWS multi-p rofile case studies, trends were not clear (see Figure 5.4c).

We found that 98% of the BWS studies had a preference-related purpose clearly stated. However, most studies did not report whether the responders were similar to non-responders, with 56 stud ies (91%) categorised as un acceptable regarding this criterion. We found that 54 studies (86% ) clearly explained methods of assessing preferences. Most studies included all responde nts in the analyses of preference results and reported findings (65%). Furthermore, 44 stud ies (71%) used significance tests to assess the preference results. Regarding the total PREF S score, half of the studies scored a 4 or higher (56.4%), of which only 5 studies achieved a score of 5.

Discussion This study reviewed current practice in the us e and conduct of BWS within health care. The use of BWS, and especially BWS object case and BWS profile case, has drastically increased in health care, with a steep increase in the last two years on a wide range of applications (e.g. valuing health outcomes an d investigating preferences between health outcomes and patient or consumer experience factors) and populations (e.g. health care professionals, patients, general population, an d caregivers). This increase of published BWS studies may indicate an increasing awar eness of advantages of the BWS method to elicit preferences in health care. It is appare nt that BWS, especially the object case, is capable of incorporating a large set of items or factors to elicit preferences compared to DCE. In DCE, the average number of incl uded factors was estimated to be 4 to 6,14 compared to an average of 17 (Mdn=12) factors for BWS object cases. BWS object case can be especially useful if one is interested in a list of items that are difficult to reduce to a number acceptable for other conjoint analyses such as a DCE. Additionally, compared to Chapter 5 94 the DCE, BWS (especially BWS object ca ses and BWS profile cases) may be less cognitively burdensome, which can be valuable in health care settin gs where preferences are often elicited from vulnerable patient groups.9 For example, it has been stated that best-worst tasks take advantage of a person 's propensity to identify and respond more consistently to extreme options and BWS task s seem easier to understand for people.9,23 Compared to results from a DCE, BWS may gi ve different findings especially due to choosing a ''worst'' may be a different psycho logical process. The literature has shown mixed results for whether similar patterns arise between the two methods and further comparison would be needed.23-25 Hence, one should be care ful when directly comparing the results of DCEs and BWS. Despite the ob served increase in the use of BWS within healthcare, the number of published BWS stud ies still lags behind the number of DCEs. Clark et al.14 identified 179 DCEs published between 1990 and 2012, which is more than three time higher than the 58 articles id entified in this pape r until April 2016. Compared to BWS object case and BWS prof ile case, a notable difference in the use of BWS multi-profile case within health care was observed. From this review, it is apparent that there is a limited application of BWS multi-profile case, which may have several explanations. One explanation is that research ers have difficulty differentiating BWS multi- profile case from a DCE, or fail to see added value in using a BWS multi-profile case over a DCE. There are only minor differences betw een both methods, which may explain that the BWS multi-profile case is often referred to as a BWS DCE.26,27 Although the BWS multi-profile case has been stated to offer di stinct advantages, such as to provide richer information than methods based on 'pick one' approach13,27 (e.g. resulting in a smaller sample size needed), the need to elicit the be st and worst alternative has the limitation of comparing a minimum of three profiles per choice task. In our review, several tren ds about changes in key aspects of BWS have been identified. First, regarding the sample size of BWS object case, we observed smaller sample sizes since 2013. Literature provides no guidance to the minimal sample size for a BWS application. Future research should focu s on developing sample size calculations based on the desired statistical power, similar to DCEs.28 Second, the median number of included factors substantially decreases in BWS object case and BWS profile case since respectively 2013 and 2011. For DCEs, literature indicates no clear trends regarding the number of factors used.14 Yet, this study revealed a trend of a decreasing number of factors included in BWS studies. Third, when looking at the type of analytical method, relatively less complicated methods (e.g. best-worst coun ting) have become increasingly popular, especially for BWS object case. In contrast with DCE where more advanced methods (such as models that take heteroge neity into account, e.g. latent class or random parameter model) are used,14 the BWS can be analysed more easily, making the method attractive to a wide range of researchers. Details regard ing the analytical methods underlying BWS can be found in M\u00fchlbacher et al..17,18 The quality of BWS studies in general is a cceptable, but there is room for improvement as still nearly half of studies (44%) scored e ither a 2 or 3 on a five-point scale. Of all studies, 35% did not include all responders in the final analyses. However, many of the Using best-worst scaling to investigate preferences in health care 95 5 studies that did not include all respondents did so for a specific reason (e.g. failed comprehension test or missing data). Most (9 0%) BWS studies did no t report whether the responders were similar to non-responders. This results in a lack of transparency that may introduce non-response bias. Future BWS st udies are thus recommended to track non- responders on some (demographic) variab les and perform comparative analyses if possible. However, due to the increase populari ty of online panels, this may not always be feasible. In addition, PREFS scores of \"0\" shou ld be interpreted with caution as low PREFS scores are not synonymous with low-quality. For instance, not using all respondents for reasons of internal validity (e.g. failure of do minance test) or due to missing values may be an appropriate choice. Our study has some potential limitations. First, as the aim of this study was to identify current practice of BWS within health care , study findings and trends may not be applicable / generalizable to BWS studies outsid e the health care setting. Second, as the number of BWS multi-profile case study is still limited, statements made regarding BWS multi-profile case in this manuscript should be treated with caution and are only provided to give some first insights in to the conduct of BWS multi-prof ile case within health care. Third, we identified some discrepancies betw een reviewers in terms of our data collection sheet and how some fields were being interpre ted (e.g. validity checks and heterogeneity). However, we resolved those discrepancies in discussions among reviewers throughout. Fourth, this study only looked at BWS as defined by Louviere et al.19 including both best and worst questions. Recently, new alternatives /variations on best-worst tasks have been published such as best-best scaling or best-only scaling.29-31 To enhance comparability and clarity, studies of this variety were not incl uded in this review. Lastly, we only included published articles and did not sear ch among conference proceedings. 6. Conclusions The use of BWS object case and BWS profile ca se has drastically incr eased in health care, especially in the last two years. The applicatio n of BWS multi-profile case is however still very limited. In recent studies, trends toward decreasing sample sizes and number of factors in BWS object case, as well as the use of less complicated analytic methods has been observed, enhancing the usefulness of BW S method to wider health care problems and making it accessible for more researchers. Next to that, the quality of BWS studies is generally acceptable, except with regards to indicating whether the responders were similar to non-responders. Hence, this implie s the need to increase transparency of BWS studies and check for non-respon se bias when possible. Furthermore, this study may serve as a vantage point reflecting state-of-the-art practices of BWS studies. Chapter 5 96 Acknowledgements KLC, BW, and MH designed and planned the study.

This paper explains the data extraction process, the ri sk of bias assessment and the transferability of EEs by means of a narrative review and expert opinion. SRs play a critical ro le in determining the comparative cost-effectiveness of healthcare interventions. It is important to determine the risk of bias and the transferability of an EE. Over the past decade, several criteria lists have been developed. This arti cle aims to provide recommendations on these criteria lists based on the thoroughness of development, feasibility, overall quality, recommendations of leading organizations, and widespread use. How to prepare a systematic re view of economic evaluations 107 6 Introduction In this article, which focuses on Step 3 of the overall framework (see Figure 6.1;1), attention will be paid to data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and transferability when preparing a systematic literature review of economic evaluations (SR-EE). Moreover, the article is also perfectly readable as a stand-alone read. Figure 6.1 Overview of 5-step approach for preparin g a systematic review of economic evaluations of healthcare interventions. In 2003, the AGREE (Appraisal of Guide lines for Research and Evaluation) collaboration issued an instrument for eval uating the process of developing clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and the quality of reporting.2 Updated in 2010 to AGREE II,3 this instrument consists of several domain s, of which \"rigor of development\", and \"applicability\" are of import ance to this paper. These two domains reveal that recommendations need to consider (a) health benefits, side effects and risks (domain 3, item 11), as well as (b) the potential re source implications of applying the recommendations or, in other words, 'what do es it cost when a certain recommendation is implemented'? (domain 5, item 20).4 This means that CPGs need to consider not only the potential effectiveness of healthcare interventio ns but also their cost-effectiveness, as well as their overall impact on budget. When creating or updating CPGs, SRs play a critical role in determining the comparative cost-effectiveness of healthcare interventions, w ith the goal of creating an efficient healthcare system.5 However, EEs are prone to seve ral biases. Bias occurs when there is a difference between the true value (i n the population) and the observed value (in the study) from any cause ot her than sampling variability.6 A bias can be unintentional or Chapter 6 108 intentional and can have either substantia l or little impact on the results of an EE.7 In order to make optimum policy decisions it is importan t to determine the risk of bias in an EE.7 For example, EEs may have a perspective that is too narrow, or may fail to incorporate important costs. In addition, one should be aw are of the opportunity costs from decisions based on poor quality EEs (i.e. misleading stud y findings, lack of transparency and clarity in reporting8). Hence, in the past decades, several criteria lists have been developed to assess the risk of bias in EEs and to evalua te the transferability of EE. These lists are important tools that help to in terpret and compare individual studies. However, due to the number and availability of all these tools, it can be difficult to make a careful selection. Full EEs can differ in a variety of aspects and all aspects can affect the quality of the evaluation and consequently bias results. Th e term \"full EE\" refers to the comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both costs (resource use) and consequences (out comes, effects).5 Basically, there are two approaches to performing an EE study7: 1) an EE which is piggy-backed onto a clinical effectiveness study (e.g. a randomized controlled trial or observational st udy), often called a trial-based EE; and 2) a model-based EE, in which data from a wide range of sources (randomized controlled trials, observational studies, trial-based EEs, other literature or reports etc.) are combined using an economic model. Both are complementary to each other.5 For a model-based EE, it is important that the external validation of the results, the key structural assumptions, and the data sources and derivation of the input data used in the mo del are well described. This way, potential policymakers or CPG develope rs are able to incorporate the strengths and limitations of the EE in their evaluation of the evidence.9 It is important to keep in mind that the quality of EEs can be only as good as the quality of the trials on which they are based.9 This holds true for both model-based EE and tr ial-based EE. As the field of effectiveness studies is relatively old in comparison with th e field of EEs, methodological issues (i.e. the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias10), reporting standards (i.e. the CONSORT statement11 and the STROBE statement12) and the grading of evidence methods (i.e. the GRADE method for determ ining the quality of a body of evidence13) have been established and are regularly being us ed and recognized in the development of CPGs for SRs. For example, as in clinical studies, biases in (full) EEs can occur as a result of poor methodological quality, which can impac t the validity of the results in terms of generalizability or transferability.7 Evers et al.7 have identified some methodological biases (so-called pre-trial and during trial biases), e.g. biases which occur as a result of a narrow perspective, inefficient comparator, cost measurement omissi on, or inappropriate discounting. In addition, they ha ve identified some after-trial biases such as reporting and dissemination bias. Although these biases are th ought of more in relation to trial-based EE, most of them are also applicable to model-based EE. Therefore, this article will fo cus only on risk of bias and transferability checklists specifically tailored for the critical appraisa l of EEs. SR-EEs can be categorized roughly into three groups; 1) multi-purpose reviews, 2) reviews for informing the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), and 3) reviews for developing decision analytic models. Both multi-purpose SR-EEs and SR -EEs for guideline development aim to How to prepare a systematic re view of economic evaluations 109 6 synthesize and critically appraise existing EEs of a healthcare intervention or disease area in order to inform policy decisions.1,14 The guidance in this paper covers only the first two types of SR categories. Accordingly, this article is aimed mainly at CPG developers, although the checklists can also aid othe rs who want to prepare SR-EEs, like HTA researchers, systematic reviewer s and students, as they seek to identify the different steps, important key sources and practic al information to gain basic knowledge on this topic. To be sure all relevant data of the included studies has been collected, it is important to develop a data extraction sheet for more sy stematic data collection. A data extraction sheet is an organized table in which all releva nt items which need to be extracted for the review are listed; this needs to be complete d for every study in order to collect data systematically. The inclusion of items depends on the research question or study objective, and on the study design and ou tcomes predefined in the stud y protocol (see Step 1.3 of the overall framework in Van Mastrigt et al.1). Accordingly, this article will first discuss th e data extraction sheet, and then present an overview of the methods most commonly used to assess the risk of bias and the transferability of EEs. Step 3.1 of the overall framework: Data extraction This step entails extracting all relevant data from the included studies. For every SR-EE a tailored data extraction sheet needs to be developed. Which items are included depends on the research question or study objectiv e, and on the study design and outcomes predefined in the study protocol (see Step 1: \"Initiating a SR-EEs\" of the overall framework). Consideration of the care pathway can be helpful in structuring the data extraction.15 In addition, the risk of bias in the in cluded studies needs to be appraised, in order to assess the possible impac t of bias on the results of SRs (Step 3.2). Excel (Microsoft Office) can be used for the digital registration of items. It is highly recommended that the extraction sheet be piloted for user-friend liness and completeness, using a few sample studies.15,16 Then, if needed, the data extraction fo rm can be adapted before starting data extraction of all studies. For Step 3.1, the data extraction of study characteristics, methods and outcomes, it is important to simply report th e findings as reported by the authors of the study and not draw any conclusions from them. This is in contrast with step 3.2, the risk of bias assessment, in which a critical appraisal of the studies is necessary for answering all questions. There are several example data extraction forms available from the literature,15-17 containing many common items. These items can be classified in two groups. First, the general study characteristics: these are, for in stance, author, year of publication, type of intervention, control treatment, eligibility criteria, study perspective, type of EE and analytic approach (trial-based versus model-based). Second are the study methods and outcomes: these include resource use, costs, effects, measurement, valuation methods, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, uncertainty analyses , sensitivity analysis and conclusions. Based Chapter 6 110 on our experience we recommen d including all relevant items from the list in Table 6.1 in the initial data extraction. If one is particular ly interested in model-based EEs one could extend this list with the external validation of the results, the key structural assumptions, and data sources and derivation of the input data used in the model. Using a picklist is recommended for choosing the different answer s. Furthermore, in order to facilitate interpretation of the results, a disaggregate d presentation of the results, as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ra tios, are highly recommended.15 When presenting information derived from the da ta extraction, in some cases it may be more appealing to present in a table than others. Table 6.2 an d Table 6.3 provide an example of how to present the general study characteristics and th e economic evidence. In this study of De Kinderen et al.18 a ketogenic diet (KD) is compared with care as usual to reduce epileptic seizures in children with intractable epilepsy.

Although the risk of bias in EEs is equally important in CPG development and multi-purpose reviews, differences might occur in the type of EEs included. In general, full EEs are recommended as being the most valid way to conduct an EE. Accordingly, we would like to stress that full EEs should be preferred ov er partial EEs at all times. However, in CPG development, and/or in the absence of full EEs , one might be interested in partial EEs (e.g. costs analyses). Partial EEs may represen t important intermediate stages in our understanding of the costs and consequences of health services programs and therefore might be convenient, e.g. in (early) CPG development.5 Hence, both full and partial EEs will be discussed separately, with the differenc e that partial EEs will be discussed only in relation to CPG development. In addition, although the risk of bias assess ment and the way of reporting the results of EEs might seem like two distinct topics, in prac tice both topics are in tertwined and difficult to differentiate from one another. For example, in order for a flawlessly conducted EE to be perceived as having \"low risk of bias\", it should be reported in a transparent and comprehensive way. While this article will focus on the risk of bias assessment of EEs, it is important to keep this in mind when reading th e rest of the article. Specifically in order to assess the reporting quality of an EE, the IS POR taskforce has developed the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards\" (CHEERS), in which recommendations are made to optimize the reporting of health EEs for all types of EE derived by either trial- or model-based EE.8 Risk of bias assessment for multipurpose SR-EEs As full EEs are considered to be the best strategy to answer efficiency questions,5 most checklists focus solely on full EEs. Over the pa st decades, several criteria checklists for the risk of bias assessment of full EEs have been constructed. A recent SR by Walker et al.19 identified 10 checklists and cr iteria lists published between 1992 and 2011. In addition to the studies identified by Walker et al., we id entified three additional st udies: the checklists of Sculpher al.22 (ISPOR checklist). An assessment of these checklists was made based on the purp ose of the development, thoroughness of the development process, number of criteria check lists, operationalization of the questions, assessment instructions, time to complete, whet her the checklist includes an overall quality score, and the number of references (providing u s w i t h a n i n d i c a t i o n o f i t s f r e q u e n c y o f use). The full overview can be found in online supplementary material I. The BMJ checklist23 and the CHEC-extended checklist, which is an extension of the original CHEC checklist to include a question regarding model-based EE,24-26 are commonly considered to have more scrutiny than most other lists.16 Accordingly, the Co chrane Collaboration recommends using one of th ese two checklists to assess the ri sk of bias of full trial-based EEs conducted alongside single effectiveness st udies. In addition, the BMJ checklist is also Chapter 6 114 recommended by the Campbell & Cochrane Ec onomics Methods Group for use in SRs. However, if the scope of the critical revi ew of EEs encompasses relevant economic modelling studies, then assessments of the risk o f b i a s o f s u c h s t u d i e s w i l l n e e d t o b e informed by a different checklist, as the BMJ checklist and the CH ient for modelling studies.16 Both the Cochrane Collaboration and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend using the Philips checklist to assess modelling studies.27 However, as the Philips checklist contains a relatively large amount of criteria, using this checklist may not be feasible if one is interested specifically in a large number of model-based EEs. In cases where one is specifically interested in model-based EE and if the expected number of included studies is low (e.g. <10 studies; pragmatic decision) the Philips checklist21 could be used. In cases where the number of included model-based EEs is high (e.g. >10 studies; pragmatic decision), considering the feasibility and th oroughness of the developmental process, the ISPOR checklist is likely to be more practical for reviewing purposes.22 In Table 6.4 an example is provided of how one can conduct the appraisal of a study using the CHEC-extended checklist. The apprai sal process in this example was guided by assessment instructions specifically designed for the CHEC-checklist. Again, the study of De Kinderen et al.18 was used as an example. For most checklists, such instructions are available and make the appraisal process more straightforward. Risk of bias assessment in SR-EEs for CPG development The Grading of Recommendations Assessmen t, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach has been developed to rate the co ndence in effect estimates (quality of evidence) for clinical outcomes and is of ten used and highly recommended in CPG development.13 This approach was recently extended to include the quality of economic evidence (both for partial and full EEs). In general, the GRADE recommends that important differences in resource use should be included along with other impo rtant outcomes in the evidence proles and summary of findings tables . In this process, four key steps have been identified: 1) identify items of resource use that may differ among alternative management strategies and that are potentially important to patients and decision makers; 2) find evidence for the differences in resource use between the options being compared; 3) rate the condence in estimates of effect; and 4) if the evidence prole and summary of findings tables are being developed to inform reco mmendations in a specic setting, value the resource use in terms of costs for the spec ic setting for which recommendations are being made.28 Resource use and the cost of treatments are included in the summary of findings tables. The cost-effectiveness estim ates are included in the evid ence profiles as background information. In this way it is possible to includ e the results of partial EEs (e.g. cost analyses) in a systematic way in the GRADE approach when developing guidelines. However, the GRADE recommends excluding model-based EE as they are often based on trials which could lead to double counting.28 How to prepare a systematic re view of economic evaluations 115 6 Table 6.4 Example of critical appraisa l of the quality of the economic ev aluation using the CHEC-checklist (based on de Kinderen et al. 2016). CHEC-extended items (Evers et al. 2005; Odnoletkova et al. 2014) De Kinderen et al. (2015) 1 Is the study population clearly described? Ye s (see in method section Study population and sample size and result section; Table 2) 2 Are competing alternatives clearly described?

Yes, authors report having no conflict of interest. 20 Are ethical and distributional issues discussed appropriately? Yes, the study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Maastricht University. Chapter 6 116 Furthermore, the GRADE recommends that the condence in effect estimates for each important or critical economic outcome shou ld be appraised explicitly, using the same criteria as for health outcomes, so evidence de rived from randomized trials starts at high quality, and evidence derived from observ ational studies starts at low quality.28 In addition to integrating economic eviden ce in CPG development, using the previously described risk of bias checklist is complementary to the GR ADE-approach in assisting CPG developers in their deliberations.29 Accordingly, to overcome the lack of compatibility with model-based EEs in the GRADE-approach, the NICE has deve loped a checklist, specifically developed for the UK, composed of items from the CHEC and the Philips checklist. This composite checklist consists of 10 items regarding applicabi lity and 12 items on study limitations (see Appendix H of the NICE Guidelines Manual.27 One should be aware, however, that this list is based solely on expert opinion. Overall, it can be concluded that when using the GRADE approa ch in developing CPGs, there is a way to systematically inco rporate economic evidence from a partial EE. For further reading on this topic we recommend checking the GRADE website (http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/). In additi on to incorporating economic evidence into CPG development, it is important to perform a complementary assessment on study applicability and the possible limitatio ns for CPG using the NICE checklist.27 As the NICE checklist is specifically designed for the UK, some minor adjustments are necessary to use it across jurisdictions, paying attention to such factors as the preferred perspective, the discount rate, or the preferre d source of preference data. Step 3.3 of the overall framework: Transferability assessment of economic evaluations (for both multi-purpose SR-EEs and SR-EEs for guideline development) When conducting a SR to identify EEs which ar e applicable to a specific country or setting, or when developing a CPG and one is interested in cost-effectiveness or cost-utility data, it is important to determine the transferabil ity and generalizability of such studies. Transferability is referred to as the extent to which the results of a study hold true for a different population or setting.30 For example, results derived from a study conducted in a developed country will not be representative for use in a developing country. Generalizability is defined as the extent to wh ich the results of a study can be generalized to the population from wh ich the sample was drawn.30 Although theoretically there is a clear difference between both concepts they ar e often used interchangeably. To determine the transferability of a study it's import ant to know what country-specific pharmacoeconomic guidelines exist and what the differences are between countries. To obtain information regarding country-spec ific pharmacoeconomic guidelines, the International Society of Pharmacoeconom ics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) has developed a comparative table of 33 countries, including key features for several (mostly How to prepare a systematic re view of economic evaluations 117 6 European & American) countries (http: //www.ispor.org/peguidelines/index.asp ). For example, one should pay attention to the tariff used to derive QALYs, which is one of the key transferability issues within cost-utility an alyses, or to the perspective used and to the referred discount rates. However, solely having the key features avai lable for a country (or for a local setting) is not enough for most researchers to assess th e transferability of an EE. Accordingly, as is the case for the risk of bias assessment, several instruments exist to evaluate the transferability of an EE (see Online supplementary material II). In a SR, Goeree et al.,31 identified 7 checklists for dete rmining the transferability of EEs. Based on the same criteria as the risk of bias checklists, an assessment of these checklists and the full overview can be fo und in Online supplementary ma terial II. In comparison to the risk of bias checklists, these checklists focus mainly on deci sion-making and on the implementation of study result s in a particular setting. The ch ecklist of Welte et al. was found to be a convenient list because it ha s clear cutoff points an d can be used for the assessment of both trial- an d model-based EEs. It has been applied successfully in the past32 and the model has been tested extensively by Knies et al..30 The Welte checklist33 consists of 3 general knock-out criteria which need to be considered before proceeding to 14 specific knock-out criteria (see Table 6.5) . The Drummond (2009) checklist is largely based on the Welte checklist, an d the two checklists differ only slightly in their application and content. Accordingly, overall, using the Welte checklist can be recommended. In addition, one should be aware that it is im portant to discuss the transferability of a particular study with clinicians as clinical practice might vary between countries. In Table 6.5 an example is provided of how one may conduct the appraisal of a study using the Welte checklist. In this example, results of the study of De Kinderen et al.18 are hypothetically transferred from the Netherlands to the UK settin g. As can be seen from the example, the difference in perspective betw een the UK and the Netherlands may lead to the cost-effectiveness ratio being either too hi gh or too low. In this case, one should recalculate the cost-effectiveness ratio excl uding costs outside the healthcare setting. Usability of the different checklists for both multi-purpose SR-EEs and SR-EEs for guideline development We provide general recommendations regarding which checklist to use for assessing risk of bias and transferability. These recommendat ions are based on a balance of the various aspects as described in the previous section. Ho wever, to determine what checklist fits best, several other study-specific characteristics determ ine the actual decision of which list or lists to select. These are, for instance, the time av ailable for the review, the experience of the reviewers, the audience of the SR, and the purpose the checklist is designed for in relation to the aim of the review. In addition, the numb er of items and the time needed to complete a checklist are important fact ors in determining the applicab ility of a checklist. For example, the checklist of Philips21 is often referred to by CRD as an instrument for appraising the risk of bias within modelling studies,15 although it is often ignored, due to Chapter 6 118 the large number of criteria (61 items). Accordin gly, it is important to look at feasibility when choosing the most appropriate checklist(s). Moreover, one should be aware that rate rs are a relevant source of variability34; this highlights the importance of multiple raters (a t least two) so that discrepancies can be resolved through consensus mee tings between raters. In practic e, this implies that, in addition to having multiple raters, a few studies (i.e. two or three) should be used to pilot the assessment between multiple raters, afte r which discrepancies should be discussed between raters to ensure a more uniform asse ssment strategy (see also Step 2.4 Thielen et al.35 and van Mastrigt et al.1).

This serves as a basis for collecting data from all the articles included under review. For convenience, one shou ld include the selected risk of bias and transferability checklis ts in the data extraction sheet. Next, as shown above, several checklists exist for assessing a variety of factors influencing the validity of study results with in a particular setting. Accordingly, depending on the purpose of the review, different re commendations can be made. When one is interested in trial-based EEs, taking into account the thoroughness of the developmental process, the user friendline ss, feasibility and purpose of each checklist, the CHEC- extended24 and the BMJ checklist23 are most convenient to use. However, these checklists are insufficient when one is also interested in appraising model-based EEs. Therefore, although its length makes it cumbersome to a pply to a large number of studies, the Philips checklist21 should be considered. However, it shou ld be noted that in current literature there seems to be a lack of co nsensus regarding the best instru ment for assessing the risk of bias of model-based EEs. As stated above, all currently available checklists focus on full EEs, as full EEs are considered to deliver a high quality of eviden ce. However, especially in CPG, other factors might be considered in addition to cost -effectiveness data, such as the financial implications of the respective tr eatment. In this case, the use of a partial EE in a SR might be justified. The GRADE approach came up w ith a method of incorporating economic evidence when developing CPG, but this me thod is not suitable for model-based EEs. In addition, the GRADE approach focuses on the es timated use of resources, which is only part of a (full) economic evaluation. Therefore, we would recommend performing a complementary assessment on study applicab ility and the limitations for CPG using the NICE checklist.27 Looking at transferability, seve ral checklists have been id entified, of which the Welte checklist33 has raised the most attention, likely due to the relative ease of application. In addition, the Welte checklist ha s been thoroughly examined30 and the checklist of Drummond et al.36 is based on the work of Welte et al..33 If one is particularly interested in assessing the applicability of HTAs to resource allocation decisions, the Grutters checklist37 might be a suitable option (see Online supplem entary material II). One should keep in mind that, when incorporating economic eviden ce in a CPG, a transferability check should always be performed. A summary of the recommendations made in this article can be found in Table 6.6. The field of risk of bias assessment is develo ping quickly, resulting in numerous different checklists with different object ives. This article attempts to highlight the most important checklist currently available, but one should be aware of other checklists in this field. For example, although the product of their research is not defined as a checklist, Evers et al.7 provide a list of risks of bias in trial-based EE s. Building on this an d several other articles such as the Philips checklist,21 Adarkwah et al.38 have developed the Bias in Economic Evaluation checklist (ECOBIAS), which is a chec klist to determine the risk of bias in EEs. Chapter 6 120 However, ECOBIAS is directed more toward model-based EEs. The checklist is aimed at providing a full overview of the biases that could occur in model- and trial-based EEs and includes a total of 22 biases, of which 11 are specific for model-based economic studies. Furthermore, for model developers or us ers of decision models, Vemer et al.39 have developed a checklist, called Assessment of the Validation Status of Health-Economic decision models (AdViSHE), which provides mo del users with a structured view into the validation status of the model, according to a consensus on what good model validation entails. AdViSHE may provide guidance towards additional validation of a model. However, when preparing a SR, using these checklists as a dd-ons to other risk of bias or transferability instruments will require a good un derstanding of EEs and will make the risk of bias assessment a time-consuming exercise. Table 6.6 Recommendations on data extraction, risk of bi as, and transferability for a systematic review of EEs for SR-EEs for multi-purp ose and CPG development Step 3: Data Extraction, Risk of Bias, and Transferability Step 3.1: Data extraction for SR-EEs for multi-purpose and CPG development Data extraction- sheet Adapt the data extraction for ev ery specific study; include all relevant items from the list in Table 6.1. Include the selected risk of bias and transfer ability checklists in the data extraction sheet. It is recommended to use a picklis t to choose the different answers. Describe items to increase transparency of scoring. Data extraction Disaggregated presentation of the results is highly recommended, as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, in order to facilitate interpretation of the results. Step 3.2: Risk of Bias assessment Use CHEC-extended24 or BMJ checklist23. In cases were one is specifically interested in model-based EE and if the expected number of included studies is low (e.g. <10 studies; pragmatic decision) the Philips checklist [18] could be used. Risk of bias assessment for multi-purpose SR-EEs and CPG development In cases in which the number of included model-based EEs is high (e.g. >10 studies; pragmatic decision), the ISPOR checklist is likely to be more practical for reviewing purposes.19 In general, full EEs should be preferred over partial EEs. However, in CPG development partial EEs can be used to examine financia l implications or the budget impact of a treatment. In the absence of a full EE, par tial EEs may represent important intermediate stages in our understanding of the costs and consequences of health services programs and therefore might be convenient. Risk of bias assessment for CPG development Whenever possible, when de veloping CPGs, the GRADE approach should be used to systematically incorporat e economic evidence of (partial) EE. In addition, it is important to perform a complementary assessment on study applicability and limitations using the NICE checklist.27 Step 3.3: Transferability for SR-EEs for multi-purpose and CPG development Use the Welte checklist [42]. Transferability It is important to discuss the transferability of a particular study with clinicians as clinical practice might vary between countries. Usability for SR-EEs for multi-purpose and CPG development Raters are a relevant source of variability. It is important to have multiple raters (at le ast two) so that discre pancies can be resolved through consensus meetings. Appraisal process It is recommended that a few studies (i.e. tw o or three) should be used to pilot the assessment between multiple raters, after which discrepancies should be discussed to ensure a more uniform assessment strategy. How to prepare a systematic re view of economic evaluations 121 6 Five-year view Currently, data extraction in SR-EEs is done in several ways and every author focuses on (slightly) different aspects. However, to impr ove the comparability of studies, there is a need for a more uniform standard wi th regard to data extraction sheets. At this point numerous checklists have b een developed and applied within the field of SR and CPG development, spec ifically focused on EE. Howe ver, future research might further improve the risk of bias assessment of EEs. One important topic would be the development and validation of a single tool to assess and grade the risk of bias of both trial- and model-based full EEs in health care . Such a risk of bias assessment tool could make a substantial contribution to the field of health economics, as it would assist end users of cost-effectiveness studies to discriminate among the exploding body of literature, and help producers of such studies to establis h a clearer standard, po tentially encouraging higher quality and greater rigor.19 However, to achieve the necessary level of acceptance and use, the new tool must demo nstrate validity and reliability.19 Accordingly, it is expected that the GRADE-approach will be adjusted to include model-based EE. A third important topic would be more unif orm and widespread guidance in the use of risk assessment instruments (e.g . which checklist should be used in what situation). An internationally supported protocol for the risk of bias assessment of EEs would support comparative analyses between reviews. Fourth, there are only a limited number of st udies looking at the reliability and validity of the discussed checklists. Futu re research should provide more insights into this matter. The last topic would be to stress the need fo r increased transparency within the field of health economic model developm ent, analysis and reporting. This is particularly important for model-based EEs, where it is often difficult to fully grasp all important aspects of the model when reading only the a ccompanied article. By (freely) providing models (e.g. as online supplementary material) one could incr ease the transparency and a more reliable risk of bias assessment could be conducted. Key issues Currently, several checklists exis t for assessing the risk of bi as and the transferability of EEs. All these checklists focus on full EEs. Howe ver, when developing CPG, one might be forced to use a partial EE in resource al location decisions. For this, the GRADE approach is highly recommended. In addition, it is important to perform a complementary assessment on study applic ability and limitations using the NICE checklist.28 There is a lack of consensus regarding the best instrument for assessing the risk of bias within a model-based EE. Of the currently available checklists, the Philips checklist21 is recommended when it is deemed feasible. Chapter 6 122 The checklist of Welte et al.33 should be used when de termining transferability. There is a need to standardize the methods for data-extraction sheet development, use and filling in for EEs. There is a need for more uniform and widesp read guidance in the use of risk of bias checklists (e.g. which checklist should be us ed in what situation). An internationally supported protocol for the risk of bias a ssessment of EEs would support comparative analyses between reviews. Future research should focus on the development and valida tion of a single tool to assess and grade the risk of bias in both trial- and model-based full EEs in health care.

Wijnen 7 126 Abstract Introduction The increasing number of treatment options and the high costs associated with epilepsy have fostered the development of economic evaluations in epilepsy. It is important to examine the availability and quality of these economic evaluations and to identify potential research gaps. As well as looking at both pharmacological (anti-epileptic drugs) and non- pharmacological (e.g. epilepsy surgery, ketogenic diet, vagus nerve stimulation) therapies, this review examines the methodological quality of the full economic evaluations included. Methods Literature search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), Econlit, Web of Science and CEA Registry. In addition, Cochrane Reviews, Cochrane DARE and Cochrane Health Technology Assessment Databases were used. To identify relevant studies, predefined clinical search strategies were combined with a search filter designed to identify health economic studies. Specific search strategies were devised for the following topics: 1) anti-epileptic drugs (AED); 2) patients with cognitive deficits; 3) elderly patients; 4) epilepsy surgery; 5) ketogenic diet; vagus nerve stimulation; 7) treatment of (non)convulsive status epilepticus. Results A total of 40 publications were included in this review, 29 (73%) of which were articles about pharmacological interv entions. Mean quality score of all articles on the CHEC-extended was 81.8%, the lowest quality score being 21.05% while 5 studies had a score of 100%. Looking at the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS), the average quality score was 77.0%, the lowest being 20.0% and four studies rated as 100%. Conclusion There was a substantial difference in methodology in all in cluded articles which hampered the attempt to combine information meaningfully. Overall, the methodological quality was acceptable; however, some studies performed significantly worse than others. The heterogeneity between the studies stresses the need to define a reference case (e.g. how should an economic evaluation within epilepsy be performed) and to de rive consensus on what constitutes \"standard optimal care\". Review of EEs of epilepsy treatments 127 7 Introduction Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder of the brain which involves recurrent seizures as a result of sudden excessive electrical discharges in a group of brain cells. The site of such discharges determines the clinical manifestation. Hence, clinical manifestations of seizures vary, depending on where the disturbance star ts and how far it spreads. Epilepsy is the most common serious neurological disorder wi th a global prevalence of almost 60 million1 and an annual incidence of 50.4 per 100,000 persons.2 The increasing number of trea tment options and the high costs associated with epilepsy have fostered the development of economic eval uations in this field. Economic evaluations compare costs and consequences of health ca re interventions: for example, by examining the added value (in both costs and effects) of anti-epileptic drugs (AED) or electric stimulation such as the vagus nerve stimulatio n (VNS) or deep brain stimulation (DBS). The goal of good health policy-making is to achieve health benefits and therefore to 'produce' health. In order to ma ke good choices in health care , policy-makers try to find a balance between costs and effects of inte rventions. Economic evaluations provide a solution for this assessment, as they provid e information about the relative efficiency of choosing between alternative inte rventions. In a \"full\" economic evaluation, the additional benefits of a health care programme are weighed against the additional costs compared to a reference programme. For example, an ec onomic evaluation will reveal whether a new AED is 'good value for money' compared to existing alternatives. Economic evaluations are important at di fferent levels of decision-making. An increasing number of countries are using co st-effectiveness as a criterion for deciding whether an intervention, especially ph armaceuticals, should be reimbursed.3 Hence, in some countries, economic asse ssments are now of such high importance that a drug will not be refunded if no economic evaluation ha s been conducted. But also at the level of national healthcare services or at the level of the individual patient, economic evaluations can help in decision-making. Th e principle of economic evalua tion is simple: determine the cost/benefit ratio and select the intervention for which this ratio is the lowest. Conducting a high quality full economic evaluation is, however, no sinecure. The aim of this review is to present an ov erview of published full economic evaluations of all healthcare interventions for patients wi th epilepsy. The treatm ents assessed in this review will be categorized according to th e topics covered in the clinical practice guidelines (CPG) as developed by the Intern ational League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) and the National Institute for Care Excelle nce (NICE) for treatment of epilepsy.4,5 This review looks at both pharmacologica l (i.e. anti-epileptic drug s) and non-pharmacological therapies (e.g. epilepsy surgery, ketogenic diet and vagus nerve stimulation) and devotes a specific section to vulnerable groups (i.e. el derly and children). In add ition, it includes both trial-based and model-based fu ll economic evaluations. Furthermore, the methodological quality will be determined of published full economic evaluations of all healthcare interventions for patients with epilepsy. Chapter 7 128 1.1 Essentials of economic evaluations The general approach of an economic evalua tion is to compare the consequences of health care programmes with their costs. Th e term \"full EE\" refers to the comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both costs (resource use) and consequences (out comes, effects).6 An Incremental Cost-Effectiv eness Ratio (ICER) is then calculated for each treatment being asse ssed, where the denominator reflects the incremental gain in effects, be nefits or utilities, and the numerator reflects the additional cost of achieving that health gain. 1.2 Types of economic evaluation There are four types of full economic eval uation, namely: Cost-Minimization Analysis (CMA), Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA), Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) and Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA).6 In CMA, the effects of the interven tions of interest are assumed to be equal; one is, therefore, only interested in a reduction in costs. However, in cases where studies just assume equal effectiveness without examining it, it is questionable whether one can speak of a full EE. In a CBA, attempts ar e made to place a value on the consequences of programmes in monetary terms, in order to make them commensurate with the costs. Potentially, this is the broadest programme for justifying the costs. Expressing benefits in monetary terms is, however, often hampered by measurement problems. In a CEA, the consequences of programmes are measured in terms of the appropriate natural effects of physical units, such as '50% seizure redu ction' or 'seizure-free patients'. The main argument for these clinical meas ures is the relative ease of measurement and interpretation. One of the major limitations of the CEA and its disease-specific outcome is that it does not permit comparisons with interventions evalua ted in other disease areas (e.g. comparing blood pressure in hypertension treatment and seizure frequenc y in epilepsy treatment). In a CUA, the consequences of programmes are adjuste d by health state preference scores or utility weights; that is, states of health asso ciated with the outcomes are valued relative to one another. The most common measure of cons equences in a CUA is the Quality-Adjusted Life-Year (QALY).6 A QALY incorporates effects in terms of both quality of life (utilities) and survival (life-years gained). In contrast to th e outcome measure of the CEA, it is a generic outcome measure. To calculate QALYs, it is ne cessary to represent health on a scale where death and full health are assigned values of 0 and 1, respectively. As there are many ways of obtaining utilities to calculate QALYs, it is important to look at the methods used or the questionnaire chosen. A disease-sp ecific quality of life measure, for example, is specific to an individual disease or condition and includes dimensions relevant to that disease (e.g. epilepsy-specific QOL measur e: QOLIE-89). A generic quality of life measure is a comprehensive measure of health that has a broad range of components and is applicable across different patient groups (e.g. EuroQoL).7 Alternatively, other generic outcome measures are sometimes used such as dis ability adjusted life years (DALYs). DALYs represent the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death. Review of EEs of epilepsy treatments 129 7 1.3 Study design There are two study designs for conducting an economic evaluation, na mely trial-based or model-based design. In trial- based economic evaluations, data on resource use and effectiveness are collected simultaneously, for example, alongside a randomized trial. The benefits of this approach are th at results reflect actual data from real patients, and the internal validity of the data can be assess ed through controlled clinical conditions. A disadvantage is that it may not be possib le to generalize the treatment pathways and patient samples to the larger population. To overcome this disadvantage, it is possible to model the costs and outcomes of different tr eatments. Model-based economic evaluations provide a means of bringing all clinical, costs and quality of life data together in one model by using techniques of epidemiology or decisi on analysis. The results can, therefore, be generalized in terms of the larger populati on. Lifetime costs and outcomes can then be estimated. 1.4 Perspective of analysis The perspective indicates from which point of view an ec onomic evaluation is being considered and determines which costs will be examined, and thus which conclusions can be drawn from any particular economic evalua tion. A programme that looks unattractive from one viewpoint may look significantly be tter when other viewpoints are considered. Analytical viewpoints may include any or all of the following: the individual patient, the specific institution, the target group for specific services, the Ministry of Health budget, and the community or societal viewpoint. According to the majority of national guidelines, an economic evaluation study has to be pe rformed from the societal perspective.6,8 In this case, all costs, including health care costs, costs of patient and family and costs in other sectors should be measured, irrespective of wh o benefits from them or who pays for them. 2. Methods A protocol of this systematic review was publ ished in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (http://www.crd.yo rk.ac.uk/prospero/; registration number CRD42015019278). The PRISMA statement was foll owed in the reporting of this article.9 2.1 Literature search A literature search was performed in MEDL INE (via PubMed), EMBASE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), Econlit, We b of Science and CEA Registry. In addition, Cochrane Reviews, Cochrane DARE and Cochrane Health Technology Assessment Databases were used. To identify relevant stud ies, we combined predefined clinical search strategies (to assess effectiveness of trea tments) with a search filter constructed by the health information research unit of McMaster University (see: Chapter 7 130 http://hiru.mcmaster.ca/hiru/HIRU_Hedg es_EMBASE_Strategies.aspx), which is designed to identify health economic studies. In addition, citation tracking was performed for all included studies. As this review focuses on topics discussed in the CPGs, as developed by the ILAE and NICE for treatment of epilepsy, specific sear ch strategies were devised for the following topics: 1) anti-epileptic drugs; 2) patients with cognitive deficits; 3) patients; epilepsy surgery; 5) ketogenic diet; vagus 7) treatment of (non)convulsive status epilepticus in children; and 8) treatment of (non)convulsive status epilepticus in adults. To examine each subject/sub-area, some ''k ey'' references were identified beforehand which had to be identified through the various search strategies in the various databases. The search strategy can be found in Appendix 7.1. 2.2 Inclusion/exclusion criteria The review focused on full economic evaluations comparing different treatment options for patients with epilepsy. In addition, only articl es published in English during the period January 2000 - March 2016 were considered. Excluded were those papers focusing on diagnostics. 2.3 Data extraction & quality assessment Two researchers selected the abstracts and extracted the data independently of each other. Data was extracted using a predef ined form which included the following information: study type, year of publicatio n, year of currency and currency type, study setting (country), target population (gender and age), analysis perspective, intervention type, health outcome measure and type of economic evaluation To determine the quality of the studies, th e Consensus on health economics checklist extended (CHEC-extended) was used. This is an extension of the original CHEC checklist to include questions about mode l-based economic evaluations.10,11 To determine the quality of reporting of the included studies, the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement was used.12 In order to limit the possibility of biased results, two reviewers independently reviewed both the data extraction form and the quality appraisal of the included studie s (BFMW and OG). As a consequence, all the articles were double-scored on the data extr action and quality a ssessment part. Possible differences in scoring were di scussed until consensus was reached. Both checklists can be found in Appendix 7.2. To calculate an overall quality-score for ea ch article based on the CHEC checklist, each time a \"Yes\" was scored, 1 point was allocated and each time \"suboptimal\" was scored, 0.5 points were allocated. The total score per article was then divided by all the applicable items for that particular study.11 The same calculation was applied for the CHEERS, the only exception being, there is no \"suboptimal\" in the CHEERS. Review of EEs of epilepsy treatments 131 7 All costs were converted to Euros (\u20ac) and apply to the year 2015 based on estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF ) World Economic Outlook Database 'GDP deflator index' dataset. This dataset contains 'GDPD values' for 184 countries (currencies) from 1980 onwards.13 3. Results 3.1 Search results A total of 1474 publications were identified us ing the different search strategies and after removal of all duplicate studies, 1028 public ations were eligible for title and abstract screening. After screening the titles and abstracts for inclusio n criteria, 959 articles were excluded. Next, 71 full-text articles were a ssessed for eligibility, 31 of which were excluded for various reasons: 1) no original re search/not a full report (n=15); 2) no full economic evaluation (n=9); 3) no epilepsy (n=4 ); 4) only focused on diagnostics (n=3). A total of 40 publications were finally included in this review. The flow chart of the literature search is presented in Figure 7.1. Figure 7.1 Flowchart of study selection.

Most studies were conducted in the United Kingdom (n=12; 30%) followed by the Netherlands (n=6; 15%). The included studies re ported cost-effectiveness for the following interventions: different types of AED (29 studies; 73%), ketoge nic diet (2 studies;5%), surgery in patients (3 (2 studies; 5%) drug monitoring in patients with epilepsy (1 study; 3%). The most commonly used perspective was th e healthcare perspective (67%), followed by the societal perspective (10%). In 28 (70%) of the 40 studies, a model was used to estimate costs and effects. A comprehensive lis t of all included studies can be found in Table 7.1. 3.3 Quality of the identified studies Mean quality score of all articles on th e CHEC-extended was 81.8%, the lowest being 21.05% while 5 studies had a score of 100% (see Table 7.2). Furthermore, pharmacological studies scored 81.6% on average and non-pharmacological studies scored 82.4% on average. Look ing at the CHEERS, the aver age quality score was 77.0%, the lowest being 22.7% and four studies ra ted as 100% (see Table 7.3). Furthermore, pharmacological studies scored 77.4% on average and non-pharmacological studies scored 75.5% on average. Hence, pharmacologi cal studies scored slightly better on the reporting of their study. 3.4 Pharmacological interventions Twenty-nine articles (73%) on pharmacological interventions or anti- epileptic drugs (AED) were included in the study.

No incremental analyses performed Blais et al.36 2005 Refractory epilepsy When levetiracetam is added to the usual treatment of patients with refractory epilepsy, the increase in drug costs, from a health care perspective, may at least be partially offset by savings in other medical costs due to an increase in seizure-free days 80.46\u20ac per seizure-free day gained per general per year for levetiracetam add-on Bolin et al.23 2010 Refractory epilepsy The estimated cost per QALY gained ranged from about \u20ac 28,000 (24-months follow-up) to \u20ac 30,000 (6-months follow-up), which falls within the range of estimates of the willingness to pay for a QALY \u20ac30408.59 per QALY for two-year follow-up Bowen et al.40 2012 Refractory epilepsy The cost-effectiveness of epilepsy surgery versus continued medical management was evaluated using 3 scenarios. Each of the analyses found that epilepsy surgery was cost-effective compared with continued medical management in children with drug-refractory epilepsy (1) Starting model at first stage (children with refractory epilepsy) referral to a district epilepsy centre: 52960.92\u20ac per QALY; (2) Starting model at \"confirmed epilepsy & potential surgical candidate\": 19079.38\u20ac per QALY; (3) Starting model at point of surgery: Surgery dominates Chapter 7 142 Table 7.4 (continued) Author Year Diseasea Main outcome ICER/ICUR Chisholm et al.20 2005 Idiopathic epilepsy A significant proportion of the current burden of epilepsy in developing countries is avertable by scaling-up the routine availability of low-cost AEDs. The most cost-effective technology for reducing this burden is first-line treatment in primary care with older AEDs such as phenobarbitone and phenytoin , because their expected population-level impact is similar to those of other first-line AEDs yet their acquisition costs are appreciably lower Compared to no treatment: 1) Phenobarbitone: 870-2210\u20ac per DALY 2) Phenytoin: 905-2257\u20ac per acid: 1712-3340\u20ac per DALY Chisholm et al.21 2012 Epilepsy Older antiepileptic drugs at 50% or 80% coverage dominated newer antiepileptic drugs in primary care 1) 252.68 \u20ac or 309.89 \u20ac per DALY (at 50% or 80% coverage) 2) Dominated newer AEDa (at 50% or 80% coverage) Clements et al.39 2013 Lennox-Gastaut syndrome In base-case analyses, clobazam was more efcacious and less expensive Clobazam dominated all comparators at 3- months follow-up and 2-years follow-up Craig et al.32 2013 Epilepsy Retigabine is recommended as an option for the adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in adults aged 18 years and older with epilepsy, only when previous treatment with carbamazepine, clobazam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, sodium valproate and topiramate has not provided an adequate response, or has not been tolerated. 1) Retigabine dominated by pregabalin and tiagabine; 2) ICERs De Kinderen et al.44 2015 Refractory epilepsy From an economic viewpoint, neither VNS nor KD is a cost-effective option compared to CAU at 12 months 1 year 1) et al. 43 2016 Refractory epilepsy The results show that the KD reduces seizure frequency. The study did not nd any improvements in quality of life; therefore, unfavourable cost per QALY ratios resulted. 1) CEA: 18422.21 per responder; 2) CUA: Not presented but 5% probability of being cost-effective at the ceiling ratio of \u20ac50,000 per QALY Review of EEs of epilepsy treatments 143 7 Table 7.4 (continued) Author Year Diseasea Main outcome ICER/ICUR Frew et al.33 2007 Partial epilepsy For a willingness to pay \u00a3150,000 per QALY, the probability that any of the newer AEDs being cost-effective is less than 50%. These results indicate that the use of new AEDs as rst-choice add-on therapy does not lead to any cost-savings compared to the baseline strategy. NR Gharibnaseri et al. 34 2012 Epilepsy Adding-on new anti-epileptics to conventional regimens is cost- effective and justified considering the GDP per capita.

The probability that carbamazepine is the most cost-effective therapy is 0.75 when the willingness to pay for an additional QALY is \u00a330,000 1) Valproate: dominated; 2) Lamotrigine: dominated Chapter 7 144 Table 7.4 (continued) Author Year Diseasea Main outcome ICER/ICUR Hawkins et al. 29(3) 2005 Partial epilepsy & generalized epilepsy All AEDs offer slightly higher expected QALYs than placebo for re- fractory patients. Based on these estimates, oxcarbazepine dominates (or extendedly dominates) other therapies, and its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is \u00a317,095 per QALY gained compared with monotherapy. 1) placebo (monotherapy): - ; 2) Gabapentin: subject to extended dominance; 3) Lamotrigine: subject to extended dominance; 4) Tiagabine: dominated; 7) Topiramate: dominated Hawkins et al. 29(4) 2005 Generalized epilepsy Based on expected costs and QALYs, valproate is cheaper and slightly more effective and, therefore, dominates lamotrigine therapy 1) Lamotrigine: dominated Hawkins et al. 29(5) 2005 Generalized epile psy Topiramate is markedly more costly than placebo (monotherapy) but is more effective, generating an incremental cost per QALY gained of \u00a334,417 1) therapy drug-resistant epilepsy among paediatric patients.

Lamotrigine results in better quality- of-life outcomes in the offspring at higher costs of \u20ac175,534 per QALY. 1) lamotrigine per QALY Knoester et al. 25 2005 Epilepsy In the rst year of lamotrigine treatment, an overall effectiveness rate of 47% was found. Lamotrigine treatment was associated with extra annual direct medical costs of \u20ac452.8 on average. The largest cost difference was found in drug costs, as the extra costs for lamotrigine (\u20ac622) were only partly offset by a reduction in costs for other AEDs 1) \u20ac 1114.24 per successfully treated patient; 2) ICER for patients who started with lamotrigine because of insufficient seizure control: \u20ac 991.60 ; 3) ICER for patient lamotrigine for adverse effects: \u20ac 1277.75 Knoester et al. 14 2007 Epilepsy All models in our study show that carbamazepine-valproic acid is the reference treatment and that there are more effective treatments, but at considerable costs per extra patient treated effectively. 1) Carbamazepine - valproic acid: reference; Lamortigine- : Dominated Kristian et al. 31 2013 Epilepsy Add-on treatment using retigabine is less costly and more efcient than lacosamide add-on treatment and that the cost per additional QALY when comparing retigabine to no add-on treatment is about 2009 \u20ac 16,000 per 24 months 1) Retigabine vs lacosamide: More efficient, less costly; 2) Retigabine vs no add-on treatment: \u20ac16,952.64 per QALY Review of EEs of epilepsy treatments 145 7 Table 7.4 (continued) Author Year Diseasea Main outcome ICER/ICUR Lee et al. 51 2013 Epilepsy/Status epilepsticus (rescue medication) These economic analyses suggest that treatment with Buccolam is cost-saving compared with standard care. 1) Buccolam vs standard care scenario 1: dominant; 2) Buccolam vs standard care scenario 2: dominant; 3) Buccolam vs standard care scenario 3: dominant; 4) Buccolam vs standard care scenario 4: dominant Lee et al. 52 2014 Epilepsy/Status epilepsticus (rescue medication) Buccolam was estimated to provide greater incremental benefit when compared with rectal diazepam (primarily as a result of increased efficacy and social acceptability leading to increased use) than when com- pared with an unlicensed preparation of midazolam Dominant in all countries Majoie et al. 46 2001 Lennox-Gastaut syndrome Cost in the postoperative period of 6 months is 2876.06 Euros less than the cost in the preoperative period. The device lasts for approximately 5 years because of the limited lifetime of the batteries; it then has to be replaced by a new one. The payback period is, however, only 2.3 years, making VNS an attractive treatment modality from an economic point of view. 21.13\u20ac per one seizure Maltoni et al. 27 2003 Epilepsy Overall, our results were favourable to the adjunctive treatment with topiramate because the cost-utility ratio calculated from our primary analysis was below the conventional threshold of $50000 per QALY gained \u20ac36831.26 per QALY gained Marson et al. 17(1) 2007 Epilepsy The economic analysis le nds support to lamotrigine being preferred to CBZ in terms of both cost per seizure avoided and cost per QALY gained. With respect to the latter, there would appear to be a high probability that lamotrigine is a cost-effective alternative to carbamazepine at what might reasonably be considered 'affordable' (to the NHS) values of the ceiling ratio. 1) Both topiramate and gabapentin have positive incremental costs and negative incremental QALY gains and are, therefore, dominated by oxcarbazepine and LTG; 2) Lamotrigine is ruled out on the grounds of extended dominance; 3) the ICER for oxcarbazepine relative to carbamazepine is \u20ac9787.74 per QALY Marson et al. 17(2) 2007 Epilepsy The economic analysis le nds support to lamotrigine being preferred to CBZ in terms of both cost per seizure avoided and cost per QALY gained. With respect to the latter, there would appear to be a high probability that lamotrigine is a cost-effective alternative to carbamazepine at what might reasonably be considered 'affordable' (to the NHS) values of the ceiling ratio. 1) Lamotrigine has a positive incremental cost and a negative incremental QALY gain and is, therefore, dominated by topiramate; 2) Topiramate vs valproic acid: \u20ac 1746.01 Chapter 7 146 Table 7.4 (continued) Author Year Diseasea Main outcome ICER/ICUR Noble et al. 48 2014 Epilepsy The ENS-led intervention did not lead to a statistically significant benefit in terms of reducing subsequent visits to ED, nor was there any improvement in the secondary measures of patient well-being. Based on the average costs and QALY difference, the ENS intervention resulted in lower costs but fewer QALYs. This means that it costs an extra \u20ac36475.95 to achieve one extra QALY if the ENS intervention is NOT used. Oldham et al. 42 2015 Refractory epilepsy For the 42% of surgical patients who achieved seizure freedom (ILAE class 1), annual follow-up costs were substantially lower than for patients managed medically. NR Plumpton et al. 49 2015 Epilepsy Intervention which encourages patients to make explicit their intentions to take their antiepileptic medications can represent a cost- effective use of NHS resources, be ing both less costly and more effective and a 95% probability of being cost-effective. Dominant Rane et al. 50 2001 Generalized tonic-clonic epilepsy The group who underwent therapeutic drug monitoring showed far greater benefit in terms of reduction in number of seizures NR Remak et al. 16(1) 2003 Partial epilepsy Topiramate is a cost-effective treatment for newly diagnosed patients with epilepsy. In partial-onset seizures, first- and second-line combinations of topiramate and combinations (except topiramate-carbamazepine) Remak et al. 16(2) 2003 Generalized epilepsy In generalized seizur es, topiramate followed by lamotrigine has the most favourable cost-effectiveness ratio, given currently accepted UK thresholds. 1) Topiramate \u20ac3042.68 Remak et al. 28 2004 Epilepsy Topiramate also had the highest probability of being optimal over a wide range of the ceiling ratio. This analysis suggests that topiramate would be the strategy with the highest probability of being cost- effective. 1) Vigabatrin treatment resulted in higher utility gain at lower cost, i.e. it dominated adjunctive treatment with clobazam, gabapentin or lamotrigine. 2) 13246.06 /QALY gained compared with vigabatrin. Simoens et al. 24 2012 Refractory epilepsy This economic evaluation showed that standard AED therapy plus lacosamide dominated standard AED therapy alone Standard AED therapy plus lacosamide is more effective and less expensive than standard AED therapy alone for 6, 12, 18 and 24 months Review of EEs of epilepsy treatments 147 7 Table 7.4 (continued) Author Year Diseasea Main outcome ICER/ICUR Spackman et al. 30 2007 Refractory epilepsy with partial onset seizures Results from the model demonstrate that zonisamide is a cost- effective add-on treatment.

Verdian et al. 38 2010 Lennox-Gastaut syndrome Rufinamide may be considered to be a cost-effective alternative to topiramate as adjunctive treatment for patients with LGS in the UK. 1) Rufinamide vs topiramate: per QALY Widjaja et al. 41 2011 Intractable epilepsy Surgical management of paediatric epilepsy was both more expensive and more effective than medical management. Surgery was found to have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $36,900 for seizure freedom at one year follow-up relative to medical treatment, with a positive net monetary benet at one-year following surgery. \u20ac 282.64 per 1% seizure reduction for the surgery group relative to the medical group QALY: Quality adjusted life applicable; NR: Not reported Chapter 7 148 One study compared lamotrigine with topiramate.15 With regard to the ICER, it concluded that topiramate would dominate lamotrigine at current acquisition costs. Another study compared topiramate with lamotrigine an d carbamazepine in patients with partial epilepsy, and with valproate and lamotrig ine in patients with generalized epilepsy.16 In patients with partial epilepsy, 1st-line topirama te and 2nd- line car bamazepine resulted in an ICUR of \u20ac65,961 per QALY gained, 1st-line carbamazepine and 2nd-line combinations. patients with generalized ep ilepsy, topiramate followed by lamotrigine resulted in an ICUR of \u20ac3,043 per QALY gained, compared to valproate followed by lamotrigine; and topiramate followed by lamotrigine resulte d in an ICUR of \u20ac11,445 per QALY compared to valproate followed by topiramate. Marson et al.17 carried out two separate compar isons to examine the longer-term outcomes of standard versus new antiepilep tic drugs. In the first comparison, they compared lamo trigine; for oxcarbazepine relative to carbamazepine was \u20ac9,788 per QALY gained. In the second comparison, they compared valproate, lamotrigine and topiramate and found that lamotrigine was dominated by topiramate and that the ICUR of topiramate compared to valproate was \u20ac1,746 per QALY Balabanov et al.18 have compared oxcarbazepine w ith carbamazepine but calculated only cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs). The CE Rs of carbamazepine (two different brands) were \u20ac911 and \u20ac1,153 per QALY gained and the CER of oxcarbazepine was \u20ac2,761 per QALY gained. In another study, Balabanov et al.19 compared patients on monotherapy with carbamazepine and va lproate but did not calculate ICERs. Lastly, Chisholm et al.20 compared the use of ph enobarbitone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproic acid to no tr eatment in 9 developing regions across the world and concluded that the most cost-effec tive technology is first-line treatment in primary care with older AEDs such as ph enobarbitone and phenytoin , because their expected population-level impac t is similar to those of ot her first-line AEDs yet their acquisition costs are appreciably lower. In addition, two studies examined the cost- effectiveness of older versus newer AEDs in developing countrie s. Chisholm et al.21 concluded that for Sub-Sahara Africa and So uth east Asia older AEDs dominated newer AEDs in primary care both at 50% or 80% coverage. Likewise, albeit not calculating incremental costs and effects, Gureje et al.22 concluded that older AEDs in primary care implemented at 80% coverage offer the best value for money as more DALYs were averted at a minimal increase in cost per DALY saved. 3.4.2 AED as add-on treatment Most add-on AEDs were compared to standa rd therapy, other add-on AEDs or placebo. Two articles compared lacosamide add-on with standard therapy and calculated an ICUR. Bolin et al.23 found an ICUR of \u20ac30,409 per QALY gained and Simoens et al.24 demonstrated that standard AED therapy plus lacosamide dominated standard AED Review of EEs of epilepsy treatments 149 7 therapy. Another article compared Lamotr igine add-on with standard therapy and calculated an ICER of \u20ac1,114 per patient with 50% or more seizure reduction.25 There was one article comparing pre gabalin add-on with standard th erapy, calculating an ICUR of ICUR \u20ac36,831 gained gained for topiramate compared with vig abatrin (other AEDs were dominated). Hawkins et al.29 compared topiramate for generaliz ed seizures with placebo add-on and calculated an ICUR of \u20ac57,935 per QA LY gained. Furthermore, they compared different AEDs with placebo add-on for par tial seizures and calculated an ICUR for oxcarbazepine of \u20ac28,776 per QALY ga ined (other AEDs were dominated). Spackman et al. included switching between alternative AEDs and calculated an ICUR of \u20ac1,225 per QALY when add-on therapy with firs t-line add-on therapy with levetiracetam followed by second line lamotrigine.30 The mean cost per QALY is, therefore, a weighted average of different treatments. One study examined the cost-utility of retig abine as add-on treatment compared to lacosamide as add-on treatment or no add-on treatment in adu lt patients with refractory epilepsy.31 It was found that retigabine dominate d lacosamide and that the ICUR of retigabine vs no add-on treatment was \u20ac16,953 per QALY. A study by Craig with eslicarbazepine acetate, lacosamide, pregabalin, no (i.e. nce therapy). Retigabine was dominated by pregabalin; assuming pregabalin had been tried but failed, retigabine was dominated by tiagabine. However, assuming both pregabalin and tiagabines had b een tried and failed, retigabine had an ICUR of \u20ac23,294 per QALY gained. Frew et al.33 lamotrigine, gabapentin, topiramate, and oxcarbazepine) as add-on therapy for children with focal epilepsies in which they compar ed the add-on treatment with th e situation before the newer AED. They concluded that if there is a willingness to pay \u00a3150,000 per QALY, the probability of any of the newer AEDs being cost- effective is le ss than 50%. Gharibnaseri et al.34 examined the cost-effectiven ess of adding-on new antiepileptic drugs to conventional regimens in an attempt to control intractable se izures in children. In this study, newer AED (i.e. gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, vigabatrin, concluded that gabapentin, levetiracetam, and zonisamide were dominated by older AED. Lamotrigine, topiramate and vigabatrim were deemed to AED as for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome Two articles have compared levetiracetam add- on with standard ther apy in the treatment of patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.35,36 Compared with standard therapy, Blais Chapter 7 150 et al.36 calculated an ICER for levetiracetam of \u20ac80 per seizure-free day gained and & calculated an ICUR for levetiracetam of \u20ac11,008 per QALY gained. Two articles w lamotrigine or with topiramate add-on of \u20ac3,301 per 1% increase in successfully treated patients wi th a seizure reduction of 50% or more, compared with lamotrigin e add-on (topiramate was dominated). Verdian gained, compared with topiramate add-on (lamotrigine was dominated). Lastly, one study compared and lamotrigine. At other treatments compared.39 3.5 Non-pharmacological interventions 3.5.1 Epilepsy surgery Three studies were identified which looked at the cost-effectiveness of epilepsy surgery and compared it with continued medical manageme nt, all in children with drug-refractory epilepsy. Bowen et al.40 evaluated 3 different scenarios, all with a time horizon of 20 years. Each of the analyses found that epilepsy surgery was co st-effective compared with continued medical management in childre n with drug-refractory epilepsy; the ICERs were \u20ac52,961 and \u20ac19,079 for 2 scenarios (star ting the model at referral to a regional epilepsy centre and a district epilepsy cent re, respectively). In the case of choosing epilepsy surgery versus continued medical ma nagement in children known to be suitable candidates for surgery, the epilepsy surgery was found to be less costly and provided greater clinical benefit (i.e., is a dominant strategy). In addition, Widjaja et al.41 found that surgical management of paediatric epilepsy wa s both more expensive and more effective than medical management. Surgery was found to have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \u20ac28,264 for seizure freedom at one- year follow-up relative to medical treatment, with a positive net monetary benet one-year after surgery. The study by Oldham et al.42, which did not calculate an ICER, found that in 42% of surgical patients who achieved seizure freedom (ILAE class 1), annual follow- up costs were substantially lower than for patients managed medically. 3.5.2 Ketogenic diet Two articles were identified which looked at the cost-effectiveness of the ketogenic diet.43,44 One study compared the ketogenic diet (K D) with the vagus nerve stimulator and care as usual (i.e. medication only) and co ncluded that from an economic viewpoint, neither vagus nerve stimulation nor ketogenic di et is a cost-effective option compared to care as usual at 12 months. In the long-ter m, the probability of vagus nerve stimulation being cost-effective increased to 51% at 5 year s (at a ceiling ratio of \u20ac80,000 per QALY). The probability of ketogenic diet being cost -effective becomes 63% at 5 years when all patients are treated with the classical keto genic diet, without hospitalization during Review of EEs of epilepsy treatments 151 7 ketogenic diet initiation.44 In the other study, the KD was compared to CAU with a follow- up of 4 months. It was concluded that th e KD reduced seizure frequency but did not improve quality of life resulting in an unfavourable cost per QALY ratio.43 3.5.3 Vagus nerve stimulator In addition to the above-mentio ned paper looking at the KD ve rsus vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) and CAU, two studies were identified which examined the cost-effectiveness of vagus nerve stimulation in children with epilepsy45 and children with a special form of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.46 Both studies compared the periods before and afterVNS implantation. Despite calcul ating an ICER/ICUR, a cost-effective therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy among paediatric patients. In addition, the pre-VNS versus po st-VNS analysis demonstrated a positive impact of VNS on both clinic al and economic outcomes. The study by Majoie et al.46 demonstrated an ICER of \u20ac21 per single sei zure. In addition, the au thors concluded that the cost in the 6-month postoperative peri od is \u20ac2876.06 less than the cost in the preoperative period, and that the device will last for approximately 5 years because of the limited lifetime of the batteries. It then has to be replaced by a new one. The authors further calculate, however, that the payback period is 2.3 years, making VNS an attractive treatment modality from an economic point of view. 3.5.4 Self-management interventions Three studies looked at the cost-effectivene ss of self-management in terventions in adults with epilepsy. Beretta et al.47 compared a standard educationa l plan with usual care only (i.e. medical management). The standardized educational plan, which consisted of one hour of counselling patients, was administered on admission and in the same form after 1 month, as a reminder. Despite calculating an ICER/ICUR, the authors conclude that a patient-tailored educational strategy is ef fective in reducing drug-related problems (particularly drug interactions) in epilepsy patients with chronic comorbidities, without adding signicant monetary costs. The study by Noble et al.48 examined the cost- effectiveness of a self-man agement programme for adults with epilepsy attending the emergency department. An epilepsy nurse spec ialist intervention programme (2 one-to- one sessions delivered on an outpatient basis) was compared to care as usual. Based on the average costs and QALY difference, the se lf-management interven tion resulted in lower costs but fewer QALYs. The calculated ICER in this study showed that it costs an extra \u20ac36,475.95 to achieve one extra QALY if the new intervention is NOT used. However, authors add that the study was underpowered to detect the hypothesized effect on emergency department use. Lastly, Plumpton et al.49 conducted an economic evaluation of a behaviour-modifying intervention to enhance antiepileptic drug adhe rence, which consisted of a booklet of self- report measures following a neur ology appointment. In this study, the intervention was both less costly and more effective, and therefore dominated care as usual. Chapter 7 152 3.5.5 Therapeutic Drug-monitoring One study examined the effect of therapeutic drug-monitoring in adult patients with generalized tonic-clonic epilepsy.50 The intervention group was compared to a care as usual group. The study did not incorporate an ICER/ICUR, but demonstrated a benet in terms of reduction in number of seizures, nu mber of adverse events, better earning status and marital status compared with the grou p who had not undergone the intervention. 3.6 Vulnerable groups Both the ILAE and NICE guid elines identify several vulner able groups requiring special attention when providing care. These areas are: 1) patients with cognitive deficits; 2) elderly patients; and 3) the treatment of (non)convulsive status epilepticus in both children and adults. No economic evaluations were found which specifically focused on the first two categories, nor on the treatment of (non)convulsive status epilepticus in adults. Lee et al.51,52 conducted two studies on the cost-effectiveness of licensed oromucosal midazolam for the treatment of children experiencing acute ep ileptic seizure. In the first study, licensed oromucosal midazolam was co mpared to standard care (unlicensed buccal midazolam & rectal diazepam), unlicensed buccal midazolam and The ICUR of licensed oromucosal midazolam appe ared to be dominant in all comparisons.51 In the second study, Lee et al.52 compared licensed oromucos al midazolam to the same comparators, placing the outc omes in a country-specific context for Scotland, Wales, Germany, Spain, France, Italy and Switzerland. Again, the ICURs of licensed oromucosal midazolam appeared to be dominant in all comparisons. 4. Discussion This review aims to present an overview of pu blished full economic evaluations of all health care interventions for patients with epilepsy. The chosen structure fo llows a categorization used by the ILAE and NICE, which will also be applied in the first part of this discussion. It is important to distinguish between st udies which have performed a cost-utility analysis and those which have performed a co st-effectiveness analysis. In the cost-utility analysis, outcomes are presented in cost pe r QALY gain; in cost-effectiveness analysis, outcomes are presented in cost per clinical outcome measure (e.g. seizure frequency). In most countries, contrary to cost-effec tiveness outcomes, willingness to pay (WTP) thresholds are available for QALYs. For exampl e, in the Netherlands, the WTP for a QALY ranges between \u20ac20,000 and \u20ac80,000.53 Hence, if an ICUR is below this threshold, the intervention is considered to be cost-effective. For clinical outcomes, it is difficult to decide whether or not an intervention is cost-effective, as it is often not known how much society is willing to pay for such a unit of effect (e.g. it is not known how much society is willing to pay for 50% seizure reduction). In addition, it is also difficult to estimate the improvement in Review of EEs of epilepsy treatments 153 7 QALYs given a certain clinical improvement (e.g. mapping the clinical status of a patient to a utility score). As well as comparability between studies, it is of utmost importance that the evaluations are of high quality as influential decisions (e .g. reimbursement decision) depend on these. Overall, the methodological quality was ac ceptable; however, some studies performed significantly worse than others. A study of Wilby et al.54 examined the qual ity of economic evaluations in epilepsy to develop an economic model (without a standardized questionnaire) and concluded that there were problems in studies bas ing conclusions on a small number of trials and using inappropri ate assumptions to extrapolate beyond the length of time of the study. A study of Odenoletkova et al.11 examined the quality of therapeutic education interventi ons on the development and pr ogression of type 2 diabetes in a similar way (e.g. using the CHEC) and reve aled similar scores co mpared to our study. However, none of their included articles had a perfect score. In contrast, Steenbergen et al.55 examined the quality of economic evaluati ons in major depressive disorder and found that the included studies only scored a maxi mum of 53% on the CHEC-list, indicating that the quality of the studies was poor. Lastly, a study of Udsen et al.56 examined the quality of economic evaluations within chronic obstru ctive pulmonary disease and also concluded that the quality of the econ omic evidence was poor. AED as monotherapy & AED as add-on treatment Difficulties arise when comparin g studies. The lack of comparability (e.g. due to different scope, different AED being compar ed or specific types of epile psy) in terms of treatments and/or comparators, means it is difficult to draw overall conclusion. One can conclude that, in comparison to other categories, AE Ds have been substantially subjected to economic evaluations. Epilepsy surgery No study calculated ICURs for epilepsy surgery. Surgery was, however, found to be more effective in all studies, resulting in ICERs ranging from \u20ac19,079 to \u20ac52,961 for seizure freedom at one-year fo llow-up. All studies were cond ucted in children. In children known to be suitable candidates for surgery, epilepsy surgery was found to be less costly and provided greater clinical be nefit (i.e., is a dominant strategy). The lack of cost-utility analyses makes it difficult to use these studies in policy decisions. Also, there appears to be a knowledge gap in the economic evalua tion of epilepsy surgery in adults. Ketogenic diet The KD was shown to be clinically effective, especially in the RCT of de Kinderen et al..43 It was concluded that the KD reduced seizure fr equency but did not improve quality of life; therefore, unfavourable cost per QALY ratios resulted. One should, however, be aware of the limited follow-up of the RCT (f our-month interim analysis). Chapter 7 154 Vagus nerve stimulator One author calculated an ICUR and conclude d that the vagus nerve stimulator was not a cost-effective option compared to care as usual at 12 months. In the long-term, the probability of vagus nerve stimulator being co st-effective increased to 51% at 5 years (at a ceiling ratio of \u20ac80.000 per QALY).44 Two other articles did not calculate an ICUR, but concluded this was a cost-effective therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy among paediatric patients45 and an attractive treatment modality fr om an economic point of view for paediatric patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.46 Again, the lack of cost-utility analyses makes it difficult to use these studies in policy decisions. Self-management interventions Due to the large variability in self-management intervention, it is difficult to draw broad conclusions. One can, however, conclude that the likelihood of a self-management programme being cost-effective is totally de pendent on, among others, the content and intensity of the intervention. Therapeutic drug-monitoring No ICER/ICUR was calculated but a benef it was demonstrated in terms of seizure reduction, better earning status and marital status.50 Vulnerable groups Although several vulnerable groups can be identified when looking at the population which suffers from epilepsy, only two studies could be identified which looked specifically at children experiencing acute epileptic seizur es. In both of these, licensed oromucosal midazolam dominated standard care (u nlicensed buccal midazolam & rectal diazepam).51,52 Studies focusing on other vulnerabl e groups, such as adults or children with epilepsy combined with cognitive defici ts or physical handicaps, are lacking. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this review is th e first to examine econom ic evaluations within epilepsy for all pharmacological and non-phar macological treatment currently available. Two reviewers were used to select and extrac t the data, multiple databases were used for the identification of articles and a quality chec k was performed for all included studies. In addition, the study protocol was published in the PROSPERO database beforehand and the PRISMA guidelines were followed. The fact that all included articles differed substantially in methodology hampered the attempt to combine the information regardin g various interventions meaningfully. In addition to the difference between model-base d and trial-based economic evaluations, there are many parameters of an economic evaluation which can vary widely from one Review of EEs of epilepsy treatments 155 7 study to the other. Part of th is heterogeneity is unavoidable, because of the multiple choices available when defining parameters of econ omic evaluations (e.g. designs, outcome measures, patient samples, etc.). On the ot her hand, part can be avoided, simply by following standard economic research methods. (e.g. us ing the same measure of effectiveness, preferably QALYs or using th e same comparators). To overcome this problem, the NICE institute adopted a decision -analytical approach in which all available evidence is synthesized into one newly deve loped economic model. Albeit being labour- intensive, this approach in creases the comparability betw een studies and makes it more feasible to reach overall (reimbursement) decisions.57 Furthermore, the heterogeneity between the studies may stress the need to define a reference case and to derive consensus on what constitutes \"standard optimal care\" in terms of best clinical practice that could serv e as a comparator for studies in epilepsy in general and what the preferred clinical ou tcome measure would be (e.g. 50% seizure reduction, seizure-free patients, etc.). Differe nces were not only attributable to economic parameters but also clinical outcome measures va ried extensively. A reference case is a set of methodological choices for a range of items relevant to conducting an economic evaluation that frame the bo undaries of the study, such as model horizon, outcome measure(s), resource use and costing.58 Similar initiatives have been developed in the field of osteoporosis and osteoarthritis.58,59 A previous review on economic evaluations of AED in partial epilepsy also concluded that seve ral methodological issues hampered their comparability, for example, the inclusio n of productivity losses or time horizon.60 They also emphasized that future health economic eval uations would benefit from efficacy studies that compare relevant alternatives60 as there is a lack of head-to-head comparisons especially in AED studies. The present study is likely to suffer from lim itations, one being the lack of synthesized effectiveness data. This was, however, not possible given the wide differences between studies. Furthermore, this study only includ ed published articles and did not search for conference proceedings. Hence, the results may be subject to a (minor) time lag. Lastly, in this review we did not discriminate between studies that used a broad societal perspective and a more narrow or limited societ al perspective. Studies claiming to have been conducted from a societal perspective ha ve been identified as societal perspective irrespective of what costs or outcomes were included. However, studies who claimed to use a societal perspective but used a more narrow perspective (i.e. by omitting productivity losses without valid reasons) have been downgr aded in their quality score, as some of the quality criteria specifically ask for the re lation between the perspective and actual costs/outcomes included (e.g. items 8 and 11 of the CHEC-list and item 6 of the CHEERS checklist). Recommendations Results of this study are useful for policy make rs or CPG developers. For example, they are likely to be used in the currently to be updated Dutch CPG for epilepsy. One should, Chapter 7 156 however, take care to look at the quality of a study before taking the results for granted. Also, if one is interested in CPG development, other aspects, such as transferability of results, should be taken into account. Transferab ility is the extent to which the results of a study hold true for a different population or setting.61 For example, results from India may not be applicable to the Netherlands due to difference in standard practice or in disease prevalence. To obtain information regardi ng country-specific pharmacoeconomic guidelines, the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) has developed a comparative table of 33 countries, including key features for several (mostly European & American ) countries (http://www.ispor.org/ peguidelines/index.asp ). Furthermore, if one is interest ed in CPG development, it is important to keep updating this review. The re sults of several studies are expected to be published within one or two years (e.g. SANAD- II trial in England, self-management trials for people with epilepsy62,63, and the long-term results of De Kinderen et al.64). Lastly, there is apparently only a small number of economic evaluations in certain areas such as vulnerable groups. Future research should aim to identify and fill knowledge gaps in specific areas within the field of epile psy and economic evaluations. This review highlights the need for a more standard ized approach for conducting economic evaluations within the field of epilepsy. On e way forward would be the development of a reference case providing a framework for futu re studies, hopefully resulting in a more transparent and homogeneous way of conduc ting economic evaluations. In addition, studies examining the mapping of clinical outcome measures to utility scores could potentially provide an additional way of creating more homogene ous and comparable (i.e. to other disease areas) outcomes . For example, De Kinderen et al.65 have put first efforts in creating a utility-function for transf orming clinically relevant epilepsy outcome measures into utility estimates. Key points To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first to examine economic evaluations within epilepsy for all pharmacological an d non-pharmacological treatment currently available A total of 40 publications were included in this review, twenty-nine (73%) of which were articles about pharmacological inte rventions or anti-epileptic drugs (AED). Overall, the methodological quality of th e studies was acceptable; however, some studies performed signific antly worse than others. Articles differed substantially in methodol ogy hampering the attempt to combine the information regarding various inte rventions in a meaningful way The heterogeneity between the studies stress es the need to define a reference case and to derive consensus on what constitutes \"standard optimal care\" The number of economic evaluations in ce rtain areas, such as vulnerable groups, appears to be limited. Future research should aim to id entify and fill knowledge gaps in specific areas within the field of epilepsy and economic evaluations.

Research 2017;137:91-99 Chapter 8 162 Abstract Objective To examine long-term retention rate, clinical outcomes, cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of the Ketogenic Diet (KD) compared with care as usual (CAU) in children and adolescents with intractable epilepsy from a societal perspective. Methods Participants were randomized into a KD or CAU group. Seizure frequency, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), side-effect s, seizure severity, health care costs, production losses, patient and family costs were assessed at baseline and during 16-months of follow-up. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) (i.e. cost per QALY and cost per responder) and cost- effectiveness acceptability curves are presented. Results 48 children were included in the analyses of this study (26 from KD group). In total, 58% of the KD group completed the follow-up of 16 months; 11 dropped-out for various reasons. At 16 months, 35% of the KD participants had a seizure reduction 50% from baseline, compared with 18% of the CAU participants. Mean costs per patient in the CAU group were \u20ac53,367 (extrapolated) compared to \u20ac61,019 per patient in the KD gro up, resulting in an ICER of \u20ac46,564 per responder. Cost per QALY rose well above any acceptable ceiling ratio. At 4- months' follow-up, the KD group showed significantly more gastr o-intestinal problems compared to the CAU group. At 16 months, the KD group reported fewer problems compared to CAU. Furthermore, 46.2% of the KD group reported a decrease in severity of their worst seizure compared to 32% of the CAU group. Conclusion The KD group resulted in more responders and showed greater improvement on seizure severity. Furthermore, the KD did not lead to worsening of side-effe cts other than gastro- intestinal problems (only at 4 months' follow- up). However, as only a minimal difference in QALYs was found between the KD group and the CAU group, the resulting cost per QALY ratios were inconclusive. Economic evaluation of the ketogenic diet 163 8 1. Introduction Epilepsy imposes a substantial burden on individuals and society as a whole.1,2 In Europe, about 3.4 million people suffer from epileps y, corresponding to a prevalence of 5 per 1,000 inhabitants.2 In the Netherlands, the health care costs of epilepsy in 2011 were \u20ac248 million accounting for 0.3% of the total budget. Kotsopoulos et al. examined ten epilepsy costs studies in different countries and found the proportion of national health care expenditure on epilepsy to be in the range 0.12-1.12%.3 Most patients with epilepsy are provided wi th an anti-epileptic drug (AED) treatment which is effective in about 70% of the treated patients.4 The remaining 30% patients who suffer from drug-resistant or in tractable epilepsy are subjected to a wide range of possible treatments such as epilepsy surgery, vagus nerv e stimulation, or deep brain stimulation to improve seizure control and hence the patient's quality of life (QoL). These procedures are, however, invasive and not always applicable for all patients with intractable epilepsy. Poorly controlled epilepsy results in fr equent hospitalizations and consequently institutionalization in most cases in the Netherlands. It has been suggested that the ketogenic diet (KD) can be beneficial to patients with intractable epilepsy.5 The KD is a high-fat diet with a restriction on carbohydrates that mimics the metabolic state of fasting. Ketone bodies replace glucose and become the main fuel for the brain's energy demands.6 Although the exact anticonvulsant mechanism of KD is unknown, children with drug-resistant epile psy have been successfully treated with the KD since the 1920s.7 Moreover, there are many observational studies,8-15 reviews16-19 and two randomized controlled trials (RCT)5,20 that suggest the beneficial effects of KD on seizure frequency. In addition, a recently pub lished short-term interi m analysis regarding the (cost-)effectiveness of the KD demonstr ated a significant reduction in seizure frequency.21 None of the previous studies has, however, examined the long-term (cost- )effectiveness of the KD,18 which is important in order to make allocation or reimbursement decisions in health care, as policymakers often try to find a balance between costs and effects of interventions. Hence, this study aims to examine long-ter m clinical outcomes, cost-utility and cost- effectiveness of the KD compar ed with care as usual (CAU) in children and adolescents with intractable epilepsy from a societal perspective. 2. Materials and methods 2.1 Design This economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial.22 Subjects were randomized to e ither the ketogenic diet or to usual care. The total follow-up for the KD group was 16 months; the CAU group was followed for 4 months. A detailed description of the design of th is study can be found elsewhere.23 Chapter 8 164 Early in 2016, an interim analysis was publishe d regarding the short-te rm results of this study.21 These results were based on the 4-mont h comparative phase of the study, after which subjects randomized to the KD were followed for an additional 12 months (with outcome assessments every 3 months). The resu lts in this article are based on the total follow-up and compare findings from the KD group (16 months' follow-up) to the CAU group (4 months' follow-up, extrapolated to 16 months). Figure 8.1 is a graphical representation of the study. Analyses are based on the intention-to-treat protocol (ITT). This means that all patients initially randomized to either the KD or CAU group are included in the analyses. Study data of patients randomized to the control group were extrapolated to 16 months as it was assumed that they contin ued to receive care as usual and hence no sudden change in their health status would o ccur (for more details on extrapolation, see analysis section). Figure 8.1 Overview of study design. 2.2 Population & setting This study included both children and adol escents with intractable epilepsy who had to meet the inclusion criteria: age between 1 and 18 years, diagno sed with intractable seizures (i.e. patients in whom at least 2 AEDs failed) and not eligible for epilepsy surgery, no fatty acid oxidation disorders or related diseases, no diabetes or hyperinsulinism, no prolonged QT-time syndrome, no hypercholester olemia or hypertriglyceridemia, no severe liver, kidney or pancreas diseases, no rena l tubular acidosis, no severe behavioral disorder, no malnutrition, no treatment with topiramate or acetazolamide and no positive Economic evaluation of the ketogenic diet 165 8 family history of other risk factors for kidney stones or acidosis. Patients were included between July 2010 until August 2014. The st udy was conducted by the Academic Center of Epileptology Kempenhaeghe and has been approved by the ethics committee of the Academic Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands. 2.3 Intervention Subsequent to the randomizatio n, patients assigned to the KD group were admitted to the tertiary epilepsy center for a 5-day introducti on to the KD. A dietician was in charge for both the introduction and cons ultation with the parents to determine whether the classical diet, the medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) di et, or a mixture of bo th diets should be introduced. When only tube feeding was given, a liquid form of the classical KD was used. Patients were instructed to continue taking their prescribed AEDs without change. During the 5-day administration of the KD, ketosi s was assessed using two approaches: a daily assessment in urine (in case of those toilet-t rained), and assessment in the blood by finger puncture on three occasions. The neurologist, pediatrician and epilepsy nurse also visited the children during this period. After the 5 day s in the epilepsy center, parents were in charge of the ketosis check by daily assessment in urine or three times a week in blood (by finger puncture). An electrocardiogram was included in the protocol to screen for prolonged QT syndrome, which has been reported to be a possible side-effect of the KD. The progress of the patients was also tracke d by weekly telephone meetings between parents and the epilepsy nurse, and between pa rents and the dietician. After 4 months, the dietician and epilepsy nurse continued to contac t the parents (child) by e-mail or phone on a monthly basis. Furthermore, a visit to the ne urologist, pediatrician, dietician and epilepsy nurse was scheduled every three months. Chan ges in AED regime were only allowed if medically necessary. No further protocol ca re was given. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and 4, 7, 10, 13 and 16 months after the baseline period. 2.4 Care as usual Patients assigned to the control group (care a s u s u a l ; C A U ) w e r e a l s o i n s t r u c t e d t o continue taking their AEDs as prescribed and had weekly telephon e meetings with the epilepsy nurse. 6 weeks and 4 months after the randomization, patients of the CAU group were seen by a neurologist, pediatrician an d epilepsy nurse. Changes in AED regime were only allowed if medically necessary. No further protocol care was given. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and after 4 months. Given th e design of the study, children in the CAU group were offered to receive the ketogeni c diet with a delay of four months. Chapter 8 166 Outcome measures 2.5 Seizure frequency The seizure frequency was tracked by the use of a daily seizure calendar in which the types of seizures were labeled and described in accordance w ith the classification by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE). Patients with a mean seizure reduction of 50% or more (compared to the baseline) were labeled as responders. This cut-off was based on previous literature and was estimated to be a realistic clinical target for patients with intractable epilepsy. For this purp ose, the 30-day baseline frequencies were compared to the 30-day frequency of the 16th month. Patients in the KD group who dropped out were considered to be non-responders. 2.6 Utilities The TNO-AZL Preschool Children's Quality of Life (TAPQOL) an d Children's Quality of Life (TACQOL) were used to determine utilitie s for children aged between 1 and 5 years (parent proxy) and children aged between 6 and 16 years (parent proxy). The TAPQOL contains nine domains all ranging between 0 and 100. The TACQOL contains seven domains, two of which have scores rang ing between 0 and 32 and two between 0 and 16. A mean score was calculated and transfor med into a utility-like score between 0 and 1 in order to represent a utility. The EuroQol-Yo uth (EQ-5D-Y) was used to measure the utility of patients and the EuroQol 5-Dimensions (EQ- 5D) was used to determine the utilities of parents. The EQ-5D health states were subseque ntly converted to a single utility score, which results in scores between 0 and 1. Both the Dutch and the UK utility tariffs were applied to convert the health states of the EQ-5 D into a utility. Utility scores from the EQ- 5D and utility-like utilities from the TAPQ OL and TACQOL were measured at baseline, 4 months and 16 months. QALYs were calcul ated by means of the 'under the curve method', in which the time in a certain health state was multiplied by the utility of this health state. Effects were discounted with 1.5% fo r the period exceeding one year (last four months) according to the Dutch guidelines.24 2.7 Seizure severity The National Hospital Seizure severity scale (NHS -3) was used to determine the severity of the patients' seizure. The NHS-3 consists of a structured interview in which the clinician rater assigns a score to seizure severity bas ed on interference with patient function. Information is gathered from the patient and w itnesses, if available. Eight questions are asked about: tonic-clonic movements, falling, injury, incontinence, altered consciousness, postictal impairment, and disruptive automa tisms, generating a score in the range 1 to 27.25 A difference of 2 points was estimated to be clinic ally relevant change. The NHS-3 was assessed for the worst seizure type (if patients had different types of seizure) Economic evaluation of the ketogenic diet 167 8 and for all seizure types together. Cases whic h were lost to follow-up were assumed to have no change in seizure severity. 2.8 Side-effects Subjective symptoms were assessed using the Side-effects of Anti-Epileptic Drug questionnaire (SIDAED).26 The questionnaire was adapted to a parent-reported child version; items on sexuality were excluded. Ni ne domains of side-effects were evaluated: general central nervous system, behavior/irr itability, depressive symptoms, cognitive functions, motor problems/coordination, visi on, headache, cosmetic and dermatological problems, and gastrointestinal function. For each of the 43 items, the parents rate the severity of the symptom on a four-point Likert scale (no problem, mild , moderate, or serious problem). Patients who were lost to follow-up were excluded from the analyses as they no longer adhered to the KD. 2.9 Costs Costs were calculated from a societal perspe ctive; therefore, protocol-driven intervention costs, other health care costs, patient and family costs, and productivity losses of the parent(s) were measured. Costs were expr essed in Euros and were converted (if necessary) to price year 2013 based on the re levant Consumer Price Index, to maintain comparability with the interim analysis. Costs were discounted with 4% for the period exceeding one year (last four months ) according to the Dutch guidelines.24 Health care costs, patients and family costs, and other (epilepsy-related) costs, were measured by monthly cost diaries completed by patients' parent(s). Patient and family costs included formal (paid) care, informal care, and medical de vices. Other costs included productivity losses of the parents, based on th e hours absent from work due to their child's epilepsy or their own health-related problems. Costs were evaluated using a bottom-up appro ach, in which volumes of each service used was multiplied by a standardized unit co st and summed to provide an overall total cost. Where possible, unit costs were based on standardized costs from the Dutch guidelines for cost research. Otherwise, real tariffs were used. Cost of medication was calculated using guideline prices, taking pres cription charges for pr escribed medication into account. When data on medi cation were diverse, lowest cost prices for the specific medication were used. The cost of informal ca re was calculated using shadow pricing. For this, the general hourly minimum wages were applied. Productivity costs were calculated on the basis of the Friction Cost Method (FCM), following the Dutch guidelines.24 The FCM is based on the assumption th at an organization needs a certain time span (friction period) to replace the absent worker by another wo rker (for 2013, the friction period was 12 weeks). Chapter 8 168 2.10 Data analyses Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 23. Pearson chi-square test was used to determine whether groups differed regarding the number of responders at 4 months and 16 months. Independent sample t-tests were performed to determine whether the KD group differed from the CAU group with regard to the domain of the SIDAED. Results from the CAU group, bo th costs and effects, at 4 months were extrapolated to 16 months using last observation carried fo rward. If data were totally absent, mean imputation per randomization group was used to impute missing Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). For incomplete cases, last observation was carried forward. Costs for KD group patients, for whom there was not even one follow-up visit after the comparative phase (i.e. a minimal follow-up of 7 months), were extrapolated using multiple imputations (5 times). Imputation was based on age, seizure frequency at 4 months, randomization group, diet type, and health care costs at 4 months. To account for non-normality of the cost data, predictiv e mean matching was used in which ''real'' observed values from similar cases were imputed instead of im puting regression estimates.27,28 Baseline differences in costs and utilities between groups were checked with non- parametric bootstrapping, based on 1,000 bo otstrap replications, as the data did not comply with the underlying assumptions of parametric tests. The ar ithmetic mean and 95% nonparametric confidence intervals were also calculated (1,000 bootstrap replications). Furthermore, Microsoft Excel 2010 was used to quantify the uncertainty around the Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER; i.e. costs per re sponder) and the Incremental Cost Utility Ratio (ICUR; i.e. costs per QALY gained) by means of bootstrapping both the costs and effects (5,000 bootstrap replicatio ns). The ICERs/ICURs were calculated by dividing the incremental costs by the incremental effects (p roportion of responders or QALYs). The ICERs/ICURs were presented on a cost-effectiveness (CE-)plane, which is divided into four quadrants (see Figures 8.2a and 8.2b). The north-east quadrant signifies a situation in which the alternative intervention is more costly and more effective, while the south-west quadrant signifies a situation in whic h the alternative intervention is less effective but also less costly. In these two quadrants, on e needs to decide how much one is willing to pay (WTP) for an additional unit of effect (the threshold value). If an ICER/ICUR is below the threshold value, the intervention is considered to be cost-effective. There is currently no WTP value for an extra responder with 50% seizure reduction. There is, however, a (approximate) threshold for QALYs. In The Neth erlands, there is an informal ceiling ratio between approximately \u20ac20,000 and \u20ac80,000 pe r QALY, depending on the burden of disease.29 For this study, a threshold of \u20ac50,000 was assumed, based on a disability weight of severe epilepsy of 0.657.30 To show the probability that a KD is cost-effective, given different ceiling ratios, a Cost-Effe ctiveness Acceptability Curve (CEAC) was constructed. This curve shows the percentage of ICURs that are be low the threshold per ceiling ratio.

Univariate sensitivity analyses were perfor med by taking a health care perspective compared to the societal pers pective used in the base case . Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis on the valuation of the EQ-5D was performed, comparing the use of the Dutch tariff with the use of the UK tariff. Lastly, as ho spitalization during the initiation of the KD is not common in all countries or hospitals, we have performed an incr emental analysis in which the protocol driven cost s of hospitalization were ex cluded from the intervention costs.

The percentage of female patients was 30.8% in the KD group and 59.1% in the CAU group. In both groups almost all patients used more than one AED at the start of the st udy and had tried at leas t three different AEDs in the past.

These patients had a follow-up of 2 mo nths (N=2), 3 months (N=1), and 4 months (N=4). The reasons for discontinuation after 4 months of the study were: problems with compliance (N=1); ineffective (N=1); ineffe ctive combined with adverse effects (N=1); adverse effects (N=2); seizures shifted from night to day (N=1); and stopped informed consent (N=1). During the 12-month follow -up phase, another 4 patients dropped-out. These patients had a follow-up of 7 months (N=2) and 10 months (N=2) and the reason for discontinuation were: problems with co mpliance (N=2), ineffective (N=1), and ineffective in combination with adverse effect s (N=1). In total, 15 of 26 patients (58%) completed the follow-up of 16 months. 3.2 Seizure frequency Based on intention-to-treat, th e number of responders at 4 and 16 months, defined as a seizure reduction of 50% compared to ba seline, was 50% and 34.6% in the KD group and 18.2% in the CAU group, assuming that a ll cases which were lost to follow-up were non-responders at 12 months (see Table 8. 2). At 4 months, there was a significant difference between the two groups regarding th e proportion of responders (p=0.022); at 16 months' follow-up, the difference wa s no longer significant (p=0.171). 3.3 Utilities Measuring utilities with the EQ-5 D-Y seemed only possible in a minority of patients in our sample. We, therefore, used the QoL sc ores of the TAPQOL and TACQOL (age- dependent) to calculate QALYs for the patie nts. The mean utility of the patients at, 4 months' follow-up and 16 months' follow-up was 0.753, and 0.745 , 0.753, 0.753 for the CAU group baseline (based on TAPQOL and TACQOL). The total QALYs for the 16 months' follow-up in the two groups were 0.996 and 0.998. Note that the maximum QALY over 16 months is 1.33 (calculated as: 1/12*16; one QALY represents one year in perfect health). The mean utilities for the parents at baseline, 4 months' follow-up and 16 months' follow-up were 0.875, 0.853 and the (U K tariffs) and 0.808, 0.791 and 0.791 for the CAU group (see Table 8.2). 3.4 NHS-3 Results of the NHS-3 are shown in Table 8.2.

CNS: central Economic evaluation of the ketogenic diet 173 8 3.5 Side-effects No significant difference was found between the groups at baseline. Only at 4 months, did patients in the KD group have significantly more symptoms related to gastro-intestinal problems (p=0.000). After 16 months, patient s in the KD group h ad significantly fewer side-effects with regard to behavior/irritabili ty (p=0.032), motor problems/coordination (p=0.013), and cosmetic and dermatological problems (p=0.001). No significant group differences were found in other domains (see Table 8.2). 3.6 Incremental costs and effects The intervention costs were \u20ac6,571 for the KD group and \u20ac1,548 for the control group (i.e. protocol-driven costs). The mean diet co sts were \u20ac9,483, ranging from \u20ac4,982 for the mixed diet to \u20ac13,906 for the PGT diet. The cost s for the classical diet were set to \u20ac0 as patients did not require any medicalized food to adhere to this diet. Total health care costs were \u20ac34,180 for the KD group and \u20ac23,928 for the control group. Patients and family costs, which mainly consist of informal ca re costs, were \u20ac22,517 and \u20ac24,102 for the KD and CAU groups, respectively; productivit y losses accounted for \u20ac4,275 and \u20ac5,337, respectively in the KD and CAU groups (see T able 8.3). Taken together, these costs result in an ICER of \u20ac46,564 per responder. As there was no difference in QALYs between groups, costs per QALY (i.e. ICUR) rose well above any acceptable ceiling ratio. In Figure 8.2a and 8.2b, the uncertainty around the base case ICER/ICUR is presented on the CE- plane. Figure 8.3 represents the CEAC for the costs per QALY gained. At a maximum WTP (or threshold) of \u20ac50,000 per extra QALY, ther e is a 25% chance that the KD will be cost- effective (see Figure 8.3). Using a health care perspective resulted in an ICER of \u20ac207,990 per responder. Excluding protocol-driven hospitalization costs for the admission of the KD resulted in an ICER of \u20ac35,795 per responder.

Discussion This study was the first to examine the long-t erm (cost-)effectiveness of the KD in children with intractable epilepsy. The KD group result ed in more responders, but patients in this group were more bothered by side-effects rela ted to the gastro-intest inal tract (only at Economic evaluation of the ketogenic diet 175 8 4 months' follow-up). At 16 months' follow-up, patients in the KD group reported having significantly fewer side-effects regarding behavior/irritability, motor problems/ coordination, and cosmetic an d dermatological problems. Furthermore, the KD group improved more on seizure seve rity, both in the worst seiz ure type as well as overall seizures. The costs of the total follow-up were higher in the KD group compared to the control group. However, as only a minimal difference was found between the KD and the CAU group regarding QALYs, inconclusive cost per QALY ratios resulted. Compliance with the KD was shown to be difficult in some patient s, which is also reflected in the number of drop-outs. A retention rate of 58% is fairly lo w but in line with previous literature which demonstrated a retention rate of approximately 50% after 12 months' follow-up.31 The retention rate in this study at 12 months wa s 54%. No difference was found in the quality of life of parents based on the EQ-5D. Howeve r, the domains of the EQ-5D may be too limited to have captured all relevant factors cont ributing to the increase of the quality of life of parents based on health st ate changes in their child. The reduction in side-effects at 16 months ' follow-up may be explained by several factors. First, the interim analysis already showed a decreasing trend in the number of symptoms related to gastro-intestinal problems from 6 weeks to 4 months' follow-up, probably due to small adjustments to the KD in consensus with the patients. Secondly, patients with severe side-effects may have dro pped-out of the study given the retention rate of 58%. Lastly, it is possible that the health state of patients on the KD may have improved and hence, they were less troubled by side-e ffects. We would like to stress, however, that these results should be interpreted carefully. At most, our results suggest that the KD did not lead to a worsening of side-effects othe r than gastro-intest inal problems. In our study, most patients were given the MCT diet. However, a RCT by Neal et al.31 showed that the classical diet did not have any advantage over MCT diet in terms of efcacy and tolerability. Hence, we expect that this has not impacted the results. The results reported in this article are similar to those presented in th e interim analysis of this study (see21, in which the KD was also shown to im prove clinical outcomes but failed to show benefits in terms of QALYs. However, th is study provides broader insights in long- term clinical outcomes (such as side-effect s and retention rate) and cost-effectiveness results. To the best of our knowledge, this study an d the interim analyses are the only trial- based economic evaluations of the KD in pedi atric patients with intractable epilepsy. One model-based economic evaluation has been performed, which compared CAU, vagus nerve stimulation and the KD. It also conclude d that, based on QALYs, the benefits of KD fail to outweigh the costs of the therapy.32 However, the authors st ate that the KD should not be ignored in the treatment of intractable epilepsy in individual or specific groups of patients.32 This statement can be substantiated by the (positive) clinical outcome found in the present study. The lack of effect on quality of life migh t be explained by the fact that being a responder (or improvements on other outcome measures) is not enough to improve patient's quality of life. It is also possible, ho wever, that the generic quality of life measures Chapter 8 176 used in this study were not sensitive enough to detect changes in the patients' state of health. For example, it is suggested that ta rgeted disease-specific or condition-specific utility instruments are likely to be more resp onsive than general or generic instruments.33 Other studies have examined the effectivene ss of the KD in children with epilepsy and concluded that the KD should be considered as an alternative therapy for children with difficult-to-control seizures.10 The statement that the KD is a well-tolerated therapy for intractable pediatric epilepsy,10,34 may not be true for all patients, as was shown in this study. The present study is subject to several limitations. First, the CAU group was only followed for 4 months and these results we re extrapolated to 16 months. Hence, we assume that the 4-month measurements of the CAU group were sufficient to obtain a representative sample. The main reason was that it was perceived to be unethical to prolong the CAU period. Second, a large part of the KD group dropped-out of the study for various reasons resulting in a retention rate of 58%. One fact or contributing to this large drop-out may be the fact that the KD is relativ ely time and effort-intensi ve. Third, the use of the TACQOL and TAPQOL to derive utility estimates may be debatable, as the utility scores used to calculate QALYs ar e not preference-based uti lities and consequently not comparable with other \"real\" utilities. At th e start of the study, however, no suitable preference-based generic QoL instrument wa s available for utility measurements in children. Fourth, there appears to be marked differences in the etiology of epilepsy among the 2 groups. Specifically, in the KD group, a total of 34.6% of patients had genetically mediated epilepsy, 7.7% had a structural ca use and 57.7% had an unknown etiology. In contrast, in the CAU group, 4.5%, 45.5%, and 50% of patients had genetic, structural, unknown etiologies respectively. This may raise th e possibility that etiology itself could be a contributing factor in the trial outcomes. Henc e, a logistic regression analysis has been performed to examine whether there was any ev idence regarding the influence of etiology on the change of being a responder in our study. In this model, the proportion of responders was taken as the dependent vari able and gender, age, age at seizure onset, total intelligence quotient, syndrome classi fication, study group, and etiology as the dependent variables. Although the sample size was not estimated for the use of logistic regression, this analysis did not show a significant effect of et iology on the chance of being a responder in both groups. Fifth, in view of the nature of the treatments, blinding of the patients and researchers was not possible. Th is may have impacted our results to some extent. Lastly, transferability to other center s outside The Netherlands may be hampered by the fact that the study was conducted at a te rtiary epilepsy center. For example, volumes and costs reported are (partly) related to th e protocol of the tertiary epilepsy center Kempenhaeghe. Moreover, in our centre the KD is delivered in a more thorough way by admitting every patient to the hospital for 5-days, which is not commonly done in all hospitals/centers admitting the KD. Further stud ies may examine efforts to lower costs by de-intensifying the protocol. For example, pr escribing the KD without 5-day admission to the epilepsy center, ignoring the telephone mee tings with dietician and/or nurse, or by offering solely the classical variant of the diet. Economic evaluation of the ketogenic diet 177 8 Conclusions Given the positive clinical resu lts of the KD compared to CAU demonstrated in this study, the KD may still be considered to be a pote ntially important treatment for children with intractable epilepsy. However, as there was no difference in quality of life between the two groups, at a maximum WTP of \u20ac50,000 per extr a QALY, there is only a 25% chance that the KD will be cost-effective. Further research should focus on the relationship between quality of life and seizure frequency/seizure severity.

Chapter 8 181 (Cost)-Effectiveness of a Multi-component Intervention for Adults with Epilepsy Study protocol of a Dutch randomized controlled trial (ZMILE authors contributed equallyChapter 9 182 Abstract Background In patients with epilepsy, poor adherence to anti-epileptic drugs has been shown to be the most important cause of poorly controlled epilepsy. Furthermore, it has been noted that the quality of life among patients with epilepsy can be improved by counseling and treatments aimed at increasing their self-efficacy and concordance, thus stimul ating self-management skills. However, there is a need for evidence on the effectiveness of such programs, especially within epilepsy care. Therefore, we have developed a multi-comp onent intervention (MCI) which combines a self- management/education program with e-Health interventions. Accordingl y, the overall objective of this study is to assess the (cost)-effectiveness and feasibility of the MCI, aiming to improve self-efficacy and concordance in patients with epilepsy. Methods A randomized controlled trial in two parallel groups will be conducte d to compare the MCI with a control (care as usual) condition in epilepsy patients. One hundred eligible epilepsy patients will be recruited and allocated to either the intervention or control group. The intervention group will receive the MCI consisting of a self-management/education program of six meetings, including e-Health interventions, and will be followed for 12 months. The control group will receive care as usual and will be followe d for 6 months, after which patients will be offered the possibility of participating in the MCI. The study will consist of three parts: 1) a clinical effectiveness study, 2) a cost-effectiveness study, and 3) process evaluation. The primary outcome will be self- efficacy. Secondary outcomes include adherence, side effects, change in seizure severity & frequency, improved quality of life, proactive coping, and societal costs. Outcome assessments will be done using questionnaires at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (last two applicable only for th e intervention group). Discussion In times of budget constraints, MCI could be a valuable addition to the current healthcare provision for epilepsy, as it is expected that higher concordance and self-efficacy will result in reduced use of healthcare resources and an increased QOL. Accordingly, this study is aimed helping patients to be their own provider of health care, shifting epilepsy management from professionals to self-c are by patients equipped with appropriate skills and tools. (Cost)-Effectiveness of a Multi-component Intervention for Adults with Epilepsy 183 9 Background Epilepsy is a chronic disorder of the brain, characterized by recurrent seizures. Seizures are the result of sudden, excessive electrical di scharges in a group of brain cells. Different parts of the brain can be the site of such discharges, resulting in a variety of clinical manifestations.1 Epilepsy has a considerable psychological an d emotional impact, which is strongly reflected in a reduced quality of life (Q OL) for patients suffering from epilepsy.2,3 Living with seizures is likely to affect patients' daily activities, as it interferes with many aspects of everyday life. Furthermore, epilepsy has been shown to have a large economic impact on society as a whole.4,5 For example, the unemployment ra te among epileptic patients is at least twice as high as in the general population.6-8 Recent studies have shown that up to 70 -80% of newly diagnosed epilepsy patients can be treated successfully (i.e. seizures comp letely controlled) with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs)9-11 and it is estimated that currently more than 80,000 patients in the Netherlands are treated with AEDs.12 However, to achieve and mainta in successful seizure control, adherence to treatment is of major importance. A systematic review argued that effective ways of helping people follow medical treatmen ts could have far larger effects on health than any treatment itself.13 In addition, it has been recommend ed that the cost-effectiveness of adherence interventions should be a research priority in the field of chronic diseases.14 In epilepsy, poor adherence ha s been shown to be the most important cause of poorly controlled epilepsy.15 However, this study is striving to improve 'concordance' and not only 'adherence'. The crucial di fference is that 'adherence' de scribes only the extent to which a patient takes antiepileptic drugs as pr escribed with respect to dosage and dosing intervals,16 while 'concordance' includes a consensu al agreement about taking AEDs that has been established between patient and practitioner.17 Concordance with medical treatment is closel y linked with the patients' ability to self- manage their disease, and the latter is shown to be an important fa ctor in determining quality of life.18 Self-management programs focus on supporting patients in coping with their chronic condition, eventually to maximize quality of life,19 and have been identified as useful for individuals with chronic conditio ns such as asthma, heart disease, diabetes.19,20 However, due to several reasons, results of studies relating to chronic patient groups cannot be generalized to patients with epileps y. For example, the consequences of poor self-management, i.e. not taking AEDs or irregular sleeping patterns, are not always directly observable; seizure deregulation ca n appear the same day or a couple of days later. Hence, the direct link between poor disease management and the frequency of seizures is not transparent for epilepsy patient s. A recent study showed that many patients with epilepsy seem to be unaware of missed do ses, indicating the need for pill dispensers and reminding/educational interventions.21 Self-efficacy, defined as the confidence to carry out a behavior necessary to reach a desired goal19 an important concept in self-manageme nt. Self-efficacy and changes in self- efficacy are associated with fu ture health status and it appears that enhanced self-efficacy Chapter 9 184 is at least one of the mechanisms responsi ble for the improvements in health status demonstrated by those attending self-management programs.22-24 Working within the field of epilepsy, Pramuka et al.20 piloted a psychosocial self-management program for epilepsy and observed a positive correlation be tween self-efficacy and quality of life. In addition, Amir et al.18 emphasized the possibility of increasing quality of life among patients with epilepsy by counseling and treatm ent aimed at increasing their self-efficacy. However, the Managing Epilepsy Well netw ork recently concluded that too few self- management programs exist in general an d that there are too few evidence-based programs available.25 This study will therefore evaluate the fe asibility and (cost-)effectiveness of a multi- component intervention (MCI), which combin es a self-management/education program with e-Health interventions, aiming to impr ove self-efficacy and concordance in people with epilepsy, in comparison with care as usual (CAU). Hence the MCI focuses on increasing patients' understanding of their me dical regimens, and on providing skills and tools to strengthen self-management and co mmunication between patient and healthcare professional and increase adheren ce (as a proxy for concordance). Methods This study will consist of three parts, each with its own research questions: I. Clinical effectiveness 1) Is MCI, in comparison with CAU, more effective in term s of self-efficacy and other patient-reported outcomes (self-effica cy, adherence, decrease in seizure frequency & severity, side effects of AED, controlling depression/anxiety, proactive coping, improved quality of life, and societal costs)? 2) Does the MCI have a clinical superiority over CAU in terms of a better adherence to AEDs? II. Economic evaluation 1) What is the cost-effectivene ss and the cost-utility of th e MCI in comparison with CAU from a societal perspective? III. Process evaluation 1) Has the MCI been delivered according to protocol? And if not, what are the reasons for protocol deviation? 2) What are the experiences and opinions of patients, caregivers and professionals regarding the MCI? (Cost)-Effectiveness of a Multi-component Intervention for Adults with Epilepsy 185 9 3) To what extent has the MCI impacted concordance among patients (i.e. do patients understand why it is relevant to take the AEDs, and has the MCI impacted shared decision making by means of consensual agreement between patient and doctor regarding the medical regimen?) Design A randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel groups will be conducted to compare the MCI with a control situation in epilepsy pa tients. Patients assigned to the intervention group will attend the MCI consisting of five weekly sessions and one booster session. The control group will receive CAU as naturally as possible. The follow-up of patients in the intervention group will be 12 months and the fo llow-up of patients assigned to the control group will be 6 months, after which patients in the control group have the opportunity to receive the MCI outside the study (see Figure 9.1). The study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of University Hospit al Maastricht, the Netherlands. Study population One hundred eligible epilepsy patients will be in cluded in the study. Eligible patients are adults aged 18 or over, living at home, di agnosed with epilepsy and using AEDs, who understand the Dutch language, and are w illing and able to use e-Health devices belonging to the MCI. Patients will be excluded if they are not able or willing to function in group activities or when it is expected, on th e basis of clinical judgment, that patients are not able to comprehend topics discussed w ithin the MCI (i.e. patients with cognitive deficits). Setting & recruitment This study is a collaboration between Maas tricht University and the epilepsy center Kempenhaeghe (KH). The study will be conducte d at the outpatient clinics of KH. The first MCI will be offered at the outpatient clinic at the main location of KH (Heeze), after which the MCI will be offered at other outpatient clinics (i.e. Nijmegen and Maastricht). From April 2014 onwards, neurologists and nurs e practitioners (NP) will recruit possible candidates for participation during consultations at the outpatient clinics of KH. Furthermore, a press release will be publis hed in national epilepsy magazines and on social media, and patient information leaflets w ill be distributed to patients in the outpatient clinics of KH. In the press rele ase patients are invited to send their contact information to the researchers. Chapter 9 186 Figure 9.1 Schematic representation of study design Figure 9.1 Schematic representation of study design (Cost)-Effectiveness of a Multi-component Intervention for Adults with Epilepsy 187 9 When patients show interest in participating, an informatio n meeting will be scheduled with one of the researchers (LAML or BFMW), either by phone or face-to-face, in which patients will have the opportunity to ask qu estions and in which inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked either by the researchers during th e meeting or afterwards in consultation with clinicians. During the mee ting, patients are informed about the study and that they will be randomly assigned either to the intervention or control group. After one week researchers will contact patients who have received information and want to take part in the study to plan a visit. During this vi sit an informed consent form will be signed by the patient and the researcher , and patients will be allocated randomly to either the intervention or control group. Sample size The primary outcome variable of this study will be self-efficacy as measured on the Epilepsy Self-Efficacy Scale 33 (ESES).26 In a previous pilot study exploring the effects of a psychosocial self-management program for ep ilepsy patients, with self-efficacy as the primary outcome, the difference between gr oups was approximately 10 points, with a standard deviation of 7 points on the ESES.20 Assuming that alpha = 0.05 and power p=0.90, a minimally detectable difference of 5 points between the intervention and control groups, we will need to include 42 patients per group. Based on a dropout rate of 20% we intend to include 50 patients in each group. Randomization Patients will be randomized to the MCI (interve ntion group) or to the control group, in which patients will be given the opportunity to attend the MCI outside of the study after six months of follow-up. For parallel provision of both grou ps (intervention & control), two blocks of five patients are needed at the moment of randomization. Patients will be assigned to the intervention group or the cont rol group by means of block randomization, using blocks of 10 patients. An assistant who is not involved in the trea tment nor in the trial will execute the procedure with a random ization program (www.randomization.com). Multi-component intervention (MCI) Self-management is a process in which patients take responsibility for changing their health behavior by acquiring knowle dge about their disease and tr eatment, and by managing symptoms as well as the physical and psychosocial consequences of the disease.27 This definition is a compilati on of a broad range of defi nitions about self-management, combining physical function ing and outcomes with know ledge and the psychosocial consequences of disease. Our MCI is based on this idea. In order to manage symptoms or the physical and psychosocial consequences, we will try to provide patients with knowledge about self-monitoring (by use of e-health tools) and risk management. In Chapter 9 188 addition, in order to change behavior, emphasis will be put on proactive coping, concordance and goal-setting. Patients will have the opportunity to bring one of their relatives/friends for social support, based on the fact th at self-management is not on ly supported by healthcare providers, but also by the people surro unding persons with chronic diseases.27 The intervention is based on the self-management intervention offered in the Restore4Stroke study28 but was adjusted to make it suitable for epilepsy patients. The final version of the intervention was developed in agreement with experts in the field of self-management, coordinators of the Restore4Stroke study, cl inicians, and representatives of the Epilepsy Association of the Netherlands (EVN, Epilepsie Vereniging Nederland). The intervention will be explained in a de tailed protocol for the NP offering the intervention in the outpatient clinic and in a workbook for patients and one of their relatives/friends. In addition, NPs will rece ive training beforehand on motivational interviewing (MI), as a technique to empowe r patients to set their own sustainable goals and look into conflicting beliefs. MI is define d as \"a collaborative, person-centered form of guiding to elicit and strengthen motivation for change\".29 MI focuses on exploring and resolving ambivalence and centers on motivatio nal processes within the individual that facilitate change.30 Group sessions The MCI is offered as a group treatment to groups of 5 patients and additional family members and/or friends. The MCI will last 9 weeks. During the first 5 weeks, group sessions will take place once a week, follow ed by a booster session 3 weeks later. The group sessions last 2-2.5 hours and are led by an NP with experience in working with epilepsy patient groups. The first session is ai med at providing information about the MCI, including materials, and getting to know the other participants and therapists. During the next sessions, participants will practice with the five stages of proactive coping defined by Aspinwall & Taylor.31 These five stages are (1) resource accumulation, (2) recognition of potential stressors, (3) initial appraisal, (4) pr eliminary coping effort s, and (5) elicitation and use of feedback concerning initial efforts. The model will be applied by the patients to three fixed epilepsy-related themes. The first theme will be self-monit oring and self-monit oring (e-Health) tools. The other two themes will be risk-management and sh ared decision-making/concordance. Each group session will have the same bas ic structure. The sessions will begin by looking back at goals set in th e previous meeting and how thin gs have worked in the last week. Next, the theme of the session will be introduced. Patients and caregivers will be invited to share their beliefs, emotions an d experiences with regard to the theme. Subsequently, patients and caregivers will formul ate their own action plan in order to attain a goal relevant to the theme. Patients will be instructed to keep their goals feasible, and group members will give feedback on the quality of the goals in term s of concreteness and attainability. They will help each other to recognize additional conditions and barriers (Cost)-Effectiveness of a Multi-component Intervention for Adults with Epilepsy 189 9 which need to be addressed. After the feed back discussion, patients and caregivers will formulate their final plan. e-Health The e-Health tools used in the intervention cons ist of 3 elements: 1) the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS; Aardex Ltd., Switzerland), 2) a smartphone application, and 3) an internet accessible patient database. The MEMS caps are electronic caps that fit on standard pill bottles. They re gister the date and time every time the pill bottle is opened. In addition, the MEMS of the in tervention group will include an LCD-screen which provides feedback on the number of times the bottle is opened on a particular day. These data can be downloaded from the MEMS cap by the researchers with a communication device and a computer. A computer program will then pr esent the data in simple plots which can be used to provide feedback about behavior , and to identify sub-optimal adherence patterns.32 Feedback will be provided during the MCI and during each follow-up visit. The smartphone application (\"Eppy\"; Epilepsy Foun dation, the Netherlands) is designed to register seizure frequency and other facts for persons with epilepsy, in order to provide data which can influence the management of ep ilepsy. \"Eppy\" can be downloaded at no charge from the App store (Apple Inc., USA) or from the Google Play store (Google Inc., USA). The application provides patients with the opportunity, among others, to keep a seizure diary, to set reminders for the intake of medicines and an alarm mode in which a text will be shown for bystanders in case of a seizure. Data gathered with \"Eppy\" can be synchronized to an internet accessible databas e, which gives an overview of all clinical events registered by the patient. This intern et website is owned by the patient, who can allow healthcare professionals to access it for clinical and research purposes. Booster session During the booster session the NP will rehear se goal setting themes and other themes discussed in the group sessions. Patients and care givers will have the opportunity to discuss their experiences related to their goals an d other aspects of the intervention. Control group The control condition will be a control condition with unrestricted access to CAU. Care will not be intensified after enrollment. As this wi ll be a pragmatic trial, CAU will not follow a standardized protocol. However, medical suppo rt will be documented in the electronic patient file of each patient. Medical suppor t provided in the control group might be variable, but is expected to be in agreement with the standard epil epsy guidelines (i.e. preference for mono-drug therapy, a monitoring visit every 4 months by neurologist or epilepsy nurse and change or addition of medi cation if the first AED is ineffective).33 The control group will receive MEMS but withou t feedback about their behavior. The MEMS Chapter 9 190 will be read only at the end of the follow-u p as a way to measure adherence and will not include an LCD-screen. Clinical effectiveness To assess the (cost)-effectiveness of the MCI, ou tcome assessments will be done at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (9 and 12 months applicable only for intervention group). A detailed overview regarding the ou tcome assessments can be found in Table 9.1. The following outcomes are defined: I. Primary outcomes 1) Epilepsy Self-Efficacy Scale-33 items (E SES). The ESES is a 33-item scale that measures different aspects of efficacy wi thin the self-manageme nt of epilepsy. The items represent three dimensions of se lf-management: medication management, seizure management, and general manage ment including safety and health.26 Items are rated on an 11-point Likert ratin g scale, ranging from 0, \"not at all certain I can do\", to 10, \"very certain I can do\".34 The total possible scores for the ESES range from 0 to 330. Higher scores correspond to higher levels of confidence in the ability to manage epilepsy. II. Secondary outcomes 1) Adherence, used as a proxy for concor dance, which will be determined using: 1) MEMS. Electronic monitoring, such as MEMS has been proposed as a possible \"gold standard\" for me dication adherence measurement.15,35 and 2) the Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MAR S-5), which measures self-reported adherence. The MARS-5 contains 10 items, each of which has to be answered with yes or no. Hence, the final score on the MARS-5 ranges from 0 to 10, in which a higher score represents better adherence. 2) General self-efficacy, which will be dete rmined using the Dutch adaptation of the general Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES). The GSES consists of 10 items assessed on a 4-point scale, ranging from 'totally wr ong' to 'totally true'. The scale was designed to assess self-efficacy, i.e., the belief that one's acti ons are responsible for successful outcomes. The scale scores for each ques tion ranges from 1 to 4 resulting in an overall score between 10 an d 40. Higher scores indicate patient's stronger belief in self-efficacy.36,37 3) Seizure frequency will be determined using a short questionnaire regarding seizure frequency covering the past 4 week s. The questions focus mainly on the number of seizures, whether the person documents his/her seizures and in what way the person documents his/her seizures. 4) Seizure severity, which will be determined using the Na tional Hospital Seizure Severity Scale (NHS3). The NHS3 lists seven seizure-related factors and (Cost)-Effectiveness of a Multi-component Intervention for Adults with Epilepsy 191 9 generates a score from 1 to 27, in which a higher score represents a more severe seizure.38 5) Adverse events of AED, which will be de termined using the SIDe-effect of the AntiEpileptic Drugs questionnaire (SIDAE D). The SIDAED consists of 46 items regarding possible AED-related compla ints. These items form 10 categories: general CNS, behavior (increased irrita bility), depressive symptoms, cognitive function, motor problems and co-ordin ation, visual complaints, headache, cosmetic and dermatological complain ts, gastrointestinal complaints, and sexuality and menses.39 For each item the patient rates the severity of the complaint on a four- point Likert scale (no problem, mild, moderate, or serious problem). In addition, the duration of th e complaints is scored (a few weeks, months or half a year or longer). The SIDAED ranges from 0 to 138, in which a higher score indicates more severe/frequent side-effects.39 6) Depression/Anxiety, which will be determ ined using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS has a total of 14 items, each scored on a scale of 0-3, with 3 indicating higher symptom frequencies. Scores for each subscale (anxiety and depression) can ra nge from 0-21 and scores for the entire scale (emotional distress) range from 0- 42, with higher scores indicating more distress.40 7) Self-rated proactive coping, which will be determined using the Utrecht Proactive Coping Competence Scale (UPPC). A tota l of 21 items are assessed on a 4-point scale ranging from 'not competent at all' to 'very competent'. Total scores are calculated by averaging the 99 individual item scores. Higher scores on the UPCC indicate higher levels of perc eived proactive coping competencies.41 8) Disease-specific quality of life will be measured with the Quality Of Life in Epilepsy-patient-weighted (QOLIE-31-P). The QOLIE-31-P consists of 38 items assessing 7 domains of epilepsy: Seizur e Worry, Overall QOL, Emotional well- being, Energy-Fatigue, Cognitive Functi oning, Medication Effects, Social Functioning and an Overall Score. In addition, for each domain, questions regarding how much distress a person f eels about problems and worries related to epilepsy are included.42 Each domain is scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 100. Afterwards a final score can be calc ulated using weights derived from the amount of distress related to each domain. The final score ranges between 0 to 100, in which higher values indi cate a better Quality Of Life.43 9) Generic Quality Of Life will be assessed with the EuroQoL 5 dimensions 5 levels (EQ-5D-5L). The EQ-5D-5L consists of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depre ssion, each of which can have one of five responses.44,45 Each health state will be valued using the Dutch tariffs, which will result in utilities on a scale from 0 to 1. Utilities derived from the EQ-5D-5L will be used in calculating the quality adjusted life years (QALY) by multiplying the time spent in a health state by the u tility assigned to that health state. Chapter 9 192 10) Societal costs will be measured retrospectively with the a Medical Cost Questionnaire (MCQ), an adapted versio n of the Trimbos/iMTA questionnaire for costs associated with psychiatric illness46 and the Productivity Cost Questionnaire (PCQ), each covering 3 months.

Outcomes of interest for the CEA and the CUA will be self-efficacy as assessed by the ESES, and generic quality of life as assessed by EQ-5D- 5L. We distinguish fo ur cost categories: intervention costs, healthcare sector costs, co sts for the patient and family, and productivity costs. Intervention costs will be defined as all costs related to the MCI including travel costs, personal costs, material costs, costs of e- Health tools (i.e. MEMS) and housing costs. Healthcare and patient costs will be estimate d using a questionnaire regarding healthcare resource utilization an d productivity losses. Resource use and outcomes ar e measured at the same tim e points mentioned in the effectiveness study: at baseline, 3 months , 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months in the intervention group and at 3 months and 6 mo nths in the control group. A comparison between MCI and CAU will be made in terms of incremental costs and incremental effects. (Cost)-Effectiveness of a Multi-component Intervention for Adults with Epilepsy 193 9 The time horizon will be 12 months (trial-based economic evaluation). To measure the use of health care resources, including all activi ties related to epilepsy, we gather data for each patient at baseline and at a follow-up of one year. Cost calculations will be based on the Dutch guidelines for cost calculations in healthcare.47 Process evaluation Process evaluation will be performed to asse ss whether the MCI was delivered according to protocol, to examine the experiences and opinions of patients, caregivers and professionals regarding the MCI, and to dete rmine to what extent the MCI has impacted concordance among patients. The process eval uation will be performed according to the framework provided by Saunders et al..48 This framework consists of a stepwise approach in which important characteristics for the pr ocess-evaluation plan are identified along seven basic components, namely: fidelity (qua lity), dose delivered (completeness), dose received (exposure), dose rece ived (satisfaction), reach (participation rate), recruitment and context. We will use a mixed methods design in wh ich both qualitative and quantitative data will be collected. The qualitative part will consist of observations during several group sessions over time. After each observation, a short interview will be held with the group leader(s) in which the group leader can reflec t on his/her opinion regarding the session. During the last (sixth) group session of ever y MCI-group, a short evaluation form will be handed out to patients in which they will be as ked to rate different aspects and themes of the MCI on a 7-point Likert scal e. Furthermore, at the end of the study, focus groups will be held consisting of patients included in the stud y. The selection of par ticipants will be based on maximal variation to get as many perspectives as possible. Participants will be selected based on age, sex and severity of seizures and effectiveness of the intervention (to compare patients for which the intervention wa s successful versus unsuccessful). Focus groups will be conducted using a semi-struc tured questionnaire covering the topics identified in the framework pr ovided by Saunders et al..48 Analysis Clinical effectiveness Baseline characteristics will be described, and differences between groups at baseline will be studied using t-tests or chi- square tests where appropriate. All statistical procedures will be conducted based on both th e intention-to-treat principle and on actual participation in treatment (i.e. effectiveness an alyses) and will be performed using SPSS statistics 22.0 (SPSS, IBM, Corporation, Chicago, USA). Missing data will be handled using SPSS missing value analysis on item level. Comple tely missing measurements will be handled using multiple imputation. To evaluate outcom es, change scores will be calculated and compared between the groups af ter treatment. Multi-level anal yses will be performed with (T0, T1, T2, T3 and T4) within the subjects' factor and group and between Chapter 9 194 subjects' factors to account for the nested stru cture of the data. Data from the control group will be extrapolated to 12 months. Post ho c analyses will be performed in case of significant effects. Baseline diff erences will be corrected by inclusion of covariates in the analyses. A 2-sided significance l e v e l o f 0 . 0 5 w i l l b e u s e d as a threshold to determine whether differences are statistically significant. Economic evaluation Costs calculation will be performed accordin g to the bottom-up approach, based on a detailed inventory of all cost items. Standardi zed cost prices from the Dutch manual for costing will be used in the calculations or (i f not available) calculated mean cost prices, according to providers, will be used.47 To determine the costs of drugs, the Dutch consumer reimbursement price for medication will be used . Productivity costs of the patients will be estimated with the friction cost method. Co sts will be indexed for the year 2015. As cost data are normally skewed, parametr ic tests are mostly not suitable. Hence non- parametric bootstrapping (1000 times) will be used to test for statistical differences in costs between groups and to investigate the uncertai nty around the costs. Bootstrapping will be done using Microsoft Excel (Excel, Microsoft Corporation, Washington, USA). Bootstrap replications will be used to calculate 95% conf idence intervals around the costs, based on the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. For the cost -effectiveness analysis, the corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be expressed as incremental costs per increased adherence and increm ental costs per self-efficacy (ESES). In the cost-utility analysis, the ICER will be expressed as the incremental costs per QALY gained. QALYs will be calculated using the area under the curv e method. All bootstrapped ICERs (5000 times) will be presented in a cost-eff ectiveness plane to determine th e robustness of the ICER. To determine the probability that the MCI is cost -effective given a certain ceiling ratio, a cost- effectiveness acceptability curve will be cons tructed. In addition, one-way and multi-way sensitivity analysis will be performed on the most important cost parameters. Process evaluation Quantitative data will be analyzed by descri ptive statistics (i.e. frequencies, mean and median), Chi square tests, and ANOVA. Result s from open-ended questions included in the questionnaires, focus group interviews and in terviews will be categorized to identify relevant themes. Discussion This study will determine the (c ost-)effectiveness and feasibility of the MCI to improve the management of epilepsy in adult patients an d increase self-efficacy and concordance regarding AED. The MCI is designed to stimulate self-manage ment skills and the awareness of patients with epilepsy in combinat ion with the use of e-Health interventions. (Cost)-Effectiveness of a Multi-component Intervention for Adults with Epilepsy 195 9 In times of budget constraints, MCI could be a valuable addition to current healthcare provisions for epilepsy, as it is expected th at higher concordance and self-efficacy will result in reduced healthcare resour ce use and an increased QOL. Cooperation between research an d practice is the key strength of this project, enabling the intervention to be studied in a natural en vironment; the project will facilitate further implementation of the multi-component program into the standard prac tice of KH and of other institutions. Both profes sionals and patients played impo rtant roles in the development of this program and will also be involved du ring the evaluation and implementation of the MCI program. One of the limitations of our study design is that, in case the MCI is shown to be effective, it will be difficult to identify what co mponents contribute to this effectiveness. For example, it could be that only the increa sed attention from nurses or the adherence monitoring contribute to improv ements in the patients' health status. However, we believe we have included a large vari ety of outcome assessments whic h, altogether, form a broad view of the (possible) effectiveness of MCI. To the best of our knowledge, there are curre ntly no validated questionnaires available to examine concordance. However, as this stud y is striving to improve 'concordance' and not only 'adherence', it is as sumed that any increase in adh erence by the MCI is partly explained by increased concordance (i.e. due to the educational content in the MCI). In addition, special attention will be paid to concordance during the process evaluation. Accordingly, this study is aimed at making pa tients their own provider of health care, thus shifting epilepsy management fr om professionals to self-care by patients equipped with appropriate skills and tools.

Chapter 9 199 An economic evaluation of a multi-component self- management intervention for adults with S.M.A. A. Evers Accepted for publication in Epilepsia in press Chapter 10 200 Abstract Objective The objective of this (trial-based) economic evaluation was, from a societal perspective, to compare the cost-effectiveness of a multi component self-management intervention (MCI) with care as usual (CAU) in adult patients with epilepsy over a 12 month period. Methods Participants were randomized into intervention or CAU group. Adherence, self-efficacy (ESES), quality adjusted life years (QALYs), health care costs, production losses, and patient & family costs were assessed at baseline and during the 12-month study period. Incremental cost- effectiveness ratios (ICERs) (i.e. cost per increased adherence, self-efficacy or QALY), and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were calculated and presented. Results In total, 102 patients were included in the study, of whom 52 were in the intervention group. Adherence rates over 6 months were 63.7% for the CAU group and 75.9% for the intervention group. Adherence, ESES and quality of life did not differ significantly between groups. An ICER of \u20ac54 per point increase in ESES-score at 6 months and \u20ac1105 per point increase at 12 months follow-up was found. The intervention resulted in an ICER of \u20ac88 per percentage of adherence increase at 6 months. ICERs of \u20ac8,272 and \u20ac15,144 per QALY gained were found at 6 and 12 months follow- up, respectively. Significance Although no statistically significant difference was found after baseline adjustments, cost- effectiveness estimates for MCI appear to be promising. As rules of inference are arbitrary, it has been argued that deci sions should be based only on the net benefits, irrespective of whether differences are statistically significant. Hence, the MCI may be a cost-e ffective addition to the current standard care for adults with epilepsy. Economic Evaluation of a Multi-component self-management Intervention for Adults with Epilepsy 201 10 Introduction In Europe, the prevalence of epilepsy is estimated to be 5 per 1,000 inhabitants.1 As life expectancy is rising, resulting in an aging popu lation, the expectation is that the number of people with a chronic condition su ch as epilepsy will increase.2 In terms of economic impact on society, epilepsy is highly cost-inten sive with respect to diagnosis, treatment and hospitalizations due to seizures, as we ll as unemployment and household work.3,4 Furthermore, uncontrolled sei zures negatively impact the quality of life (QoL) of patients with epilepsy.5 As the healthcare budget is insuffici ent to cover all healthcare expenses,6 economic evaluations are becoming a common requirement for reimbursement decisions.7,8 Budget constraints challenge policy make rs to make the most cost-effective and health-producing decisions wh en allocating limited resources. People with epilepsy are in many ways their own primary carers; well-controlled epilepsy often results in less productivity losses, hospitalizations, and other use of (healthcare) resources.9 Higher quality of self-care and reduced health care costs, provision of information and adequate pr oblem-solving skills are needed. Self- management education programs ar e designed to meet this need.10 Evidence from previous controlled clinical trials has indi cated positive effects of self-management programs on improving clinical outcomes and their potential to reduce costs for chronic disorders.10,11 However, the Managing Epilepsy We ll (MEW) Network has revealed the lack of evidence-based programs for epilepsy self-management education.12 One of the mechanisms responsible for the improvements in health status, demonstrated by those attending self-management programs, is self-efficacy.10 Furthermore, the effectiveness of an AED treatment not only depends on the type of AED; the patients' attitude to it is of great importance.13 Hence, adherence, or more precisel y concordance, with medical treatment is closely linked to the patients' ability to self -manage their disease, and is shown to be an important factor in determining QoL.14 Concordance reflects a consensual agreement about taking AEDs that has been est ablished between patient and practitioner.15 In this study, a full economic evalua tion was performed examining the cost- effectiveness of a multi-co mponent intervention (MCI) aimed at increasing self- management skills for people with epilepsy. He nce, the aim of this study was to compare, from a societal perspective, the cost-effectiven ess (i.e. cost per improv ed adherence or self- efficacy) and cost-utility (i.e. co st per QALY gained) of the MCI with care as usual (CAU) in adult patients with epilepsy over a period of 6 months with an extended follow-up of 12 months for the MCI group. Methods Design This trial-based economic evaluation was part of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which the clinical effectiveness of the MC I was assessed. Randomization was performed Chapter 10 202 using sealed envelopes by an independent person. The study consisted of two parallel groups in which participants we re randomly allocated to e ither the MCI group (a self- management education program with e-Health interventions) or CAU. The control group received CAU. Participants in the interventio n group were followed for 12 months and the CAU group for 6 months. After 6 months, patient s from the control group were also given the opportunity of receiving MCI; this did not form part of the study. The protocol of this study has previously been described in Leenen & Wijnen et al. (2014).16 An overview of all relevant measurements for this economic evaluation is presented in Figure 10.1. P opulation & Setting Adult patients, aged 18 years and over, diagnosed with epilepsy, living at home, using AEDs, who understand the Dutch language, and were willing and able (based on neurologists' opinion) to use e-Health devices belonging to the MCI, were eligible to participate in this study. Patients were excluded if they were not able or willing to function in group activities or when it was expected, on the basis of clinical judgment, that they were not able to comprehend topics discussed within the MCI (e.g. patients with cognitive deficits). Patients were recruited in the outpatient clinics of Kempenhaeghe and by means of national epilepsy magazines & social media. The inclusion started March 2014 and the last follow-up measurements were carried out in November 2016. Multi-component intervention The MCI consisted of 1) group sessions; 2) the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS; Aardex Ltd., Switzerland); 3) a smartphone application \"Eppy\" (Epilepsy Foundation, the Netherlands); and 4) an internet accessible patient database. The group sessions consisted of groups of 3-5 patients and additionally family members and/or friends. During the first 5 w eeks, group sessions took place once a week, followed by a booster session 4 weeks later. The group sessions lasted for 2 hours and were led by two nurse practitioners, with expe rience in working in epilepsy patient groups. During the course, participants practiced with the five stages of proactive coping described by Aspinwall & Taylor17 and three fixed epilepsy-related themes.16 These five stages were (1) resource accumulation; (2) recognition of potential stressors; (3) initial appraisal; (4) preliminary coping efforts; and (5) elicitation an d use of feedback concer ning initial efforts. The three epilepsy related themes were: (1) se lf-monitoring and self -monitoring (e-Health) tools; (2) risk-management; and (3) shared decision-making/concordance. Patients were instructed to set goals and to proactively cope with possible pitfalls. The course was based on a self-management program for patients w ith type 2 diabetes, which was shown to significantly improve self-efficacy.18 Economic Evaluation of a Multi-component self-management Intervention for Adults with Epilepsy 203 10 Figure 10.1 Design of ZMILE study (adapted version from Leenen & Wijnen et al.16) Figure 10.1 Design of ZMILE study (adapted version from Leenen & Wijnen et al.16) Chapter 10 204 The MEMS caps were electronic caps that fi t on standard pill bottles. They registered the date and time every time the pill bottle was opened. In addition, the MEMS of the intervention group included an LCD-screen which provided feedback on the number of times the bottle was opened on a particular day. Patients in th e intervention group received feedback on the medication adherence based on MEMS reports during the group sessions and after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months' follow-up. Adherence was expressed as the percentage of days the MEMS bottle was opened according to AED regime, calculated as 100 * (number of days with number of openings as prescribed / number of monitored days). The smartphone application \"Eppy\" was design ed to register seizure frequency and other facts for persons with epilepsy. The inte rnet accessible patient database consisted of a web-based interface and overview of the information gathered in \"Eppy\". Care as usual Patients in the CAU group received no interv ention; care was not intensified. The CAU group did not follow a standardized protocol . The CAU group also received the MEMS cap but without feedback about their beha vior and without a LC D-screen providing feedback regarding the number of times it was opened on a particular day. Outcomes All patients included in the study were adm inistered self-reporting questionnaires at baseline and after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months (9 and 12 months only for intervention group). Furthermore, adherence, used as a proxy for concordance, was monitored using the MEMS. The questionnaires included in the st udy were Epilepsy Self-Efficacy Scale-33 item (ESES), the Quality of Life in Epilepsy-pa tient-weighted (QOLIE-31-P), the EuroQol 5 dimensions 5 levels (EQ-5D-5L), and a questi onnaire regarding (health care) resource use over the past 3 months. The ESES was used to assess the efficacy of self-management education program on epilepsy. Self-efficacy was defined as the conf idence to carry out a behavior necessary to reach a desired goal.19-21 The items represent three di mensions of self-management: medication management, seizur e management, and general management including safety and health. The total possible scores for the ESES range from 0 to 330. Higher scores correspond to higher levels of conf idence in ability to manage epilepsy.22 The EQ-5D-5L was used to assess generic QoL expressed in a utility with a value between 0 and1, where 1 means perfect health and 0 worst imaginable state of health.23 Utilities were derived using the Dutch tariffs.24 Disease-specific quality of life was measured with the QOLIE-31-P, which consists of 38 items assessing 7 domains of epilepsy: seizure worry, overall QOL, emotional well- being, energy-fatigue, cognitive functioning, me dication effects, social functioning and an overall score.25 The final score ranges from 0 to 100 , in which higher values indicate a better QoL.26 Economic Evaluation of a Multi-component self-management Intervention for Adults with Epilepsy 205 10 Health care resource use was measured us ing the Medical Cost Questionnaire, which was an adapted version of the Trimbos/iMTA questionnaire for costs associated with psychiatric illness. Productivity costs we re measured with the Productivity Cost Questionnaire, both covering 3 months. A detailed description of the measuremen t instruments can be found in Leenen & Wijnen et al. (2014).16 Costs This economic evaluation was performed acco rding to the Dutch guidelines for economic evaluations27 and the Consolidated Health Econom ic Evaluation Reporting Standards.28 A cost-effectiveness (CEA) and cost-utility analys is (CUA) were performed from a societal perspective to estimate the cost per QALY gain. Costs were divided into four cost categories: intervention costs, healthcare sector costs, costs for patient and family, and productivity costs. The calculation was based on a detailed inventory covering all cost items co mposed of standardized cost prices from the Dutch manual for costing, and the calculated mean cost prices from the providers. To determine the costs of drugs, th e website of the Dutch healthca re institute for the cost of pharmaceuticals (www.medicijnkosten.nl) was used . Intervention costs in cluded the costs of the MEMS and costs associated with the MCI su ch as overhead costs, costs for instructors, costs of feedback sessions and time costs for pa tients and relatives or friends (if a relative or friend was brought to the group sessions by a patient). Healthcare costs consisted of consultations with healthcare professional s, the use of diagnostic methods, and the frequency of inpatient stay and outpatient trea tment. Patient and fam ily costs included the use of formal (paid) care, informal care, an d medical devices. The costs for unpaid care were valued using the proxy good method, whic h values the time spent on informal care at the labor market price of a close market substit ute. Productivity costs included productivity losses due to absence from work and were valued using the friction cost method as recommended in the Dutch guidelines.27 The friction cost method implies that long-term sick or absent employees will be replaced by employ ers after a specified friction period based on the average period an empl oyer needs to replace a sick employee. In the Netherlands, a friction period of 85 days is recommended. All costs were indexed for the year 2015. As the study follow-up was one year, no discou nting was performed (f or either costs or effects). Analyses Baseline differences in costs were checked with nonparametric bootstrapping, based on 1,000 bootstrap replications, as the data did not comply with the underlying assumptions of parametric tests using Microsoft Excel 20 10. ESES-scores, QOLIE-31P scores, utilities and demographic variables were assessed fo r baseline differences using independent t-tests (for continuous variable s) or Pearsons' chi-square test s (for categorical variables) using IBM SPSS Statistics version 24. Adhere nce rates were compared using Wilcoxon Chapter 10 206 rank test for repeated measurements. Missing values (i.e. EQ-5D-5L, ESES, QOLIE-31p and costs) at baseline were managed using mean imputation (n=3 for CAU group and n=1 for intervention group) due to the low number of missing values and as no clinical in- formation was available for these patients. Missing data at follow-up measurements were dealt with using multiple imputation (5 times). Imputation was based on age, number of medications, employment, seizure frequency at baseline, seizure severity, self-efficacy score, randomization group, health care, patients & family and productivity costs at each time point (for cost data only), EQ-5D-5L scores at each time point (for EQ-5D data only), ESES scores at each time point (for ESES data only) and QOLIE-31p score at each time point (for QOLIE-31p data only). To account for non-normality of the cost data, predictive mean matching was used in which ''real'' observed values from similar cases were imputed instead of imputing regression estimates.29,30 QALYs were calculated by means of the \"under the curve method,\" in which the time in a certain health state was multiplied by the utility of this health state.31 Disease-specific QALYs were calculated based on the QOLIE-31p by dividing the total QOLIE-31p score by 100 to obtain disease-specific utility-like scores. An intention to treat (ITT) protocol was used, meaning that all patients initially included in the study were included in the analyses. For the analysis of the MEMS, this implied that all patients who initiated the MEMS were included in the analysis. Analyses were carried out at 6 months (end of comparative phase) and after 12 months' follow-up. The CAU group was only followed for 6 months and the results extrapolated to 12 months assuming that this period was sufficient to obtain a representative estimation of 12 months follow-up costs. As adherence was measured using MEMS caps in both groups, which may be seen as an intervention in both groups, the ICER for adherence rates was only calculated for the comparative phase (6 months). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated by dividing the incremental costs by the incremental effects or QALYs, resulting in the costs per increased adherence, self-efficacy, QALY or disease-specific QALY of the MCI as opposed to CAU. To quantify the uncertainty around the ICER/ICUR, non- parametric bootstrapping was performed (5000 times). To show the probability that the MCI is cost-effective, given different ceiling ratios, a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) was constructed. In the Netherlands, the Council for Public Health and Health Care proposed an informal ceiling ratio for QALYs between \u20ac20,000 and \u20ac80,000 per QALY, depending on the burden of disease.32 Based on this proposition and the disability weight of (severe) epilepsy reported elsewhere,33 one could assume that the maximum willingness to pay for one QALY is approximately \u20ac50,000. A regression-based adjustment was performed to account for the difference in baseline costs, (disease-specific) utilities and ESES scores between both groups.34,35 One-way sensitivity analyses were performed by 1) Using disease-specific QALYs based on the QOLIE-31p; 2) applying a healthcare perspective, instead of a societal perspective, as some European countries tend to adopt this; 3) excluding the costs of theEconomic Evaluation of a Multi-component self-management Intervention for Adults with Epilepsy 207 10 MEMS for the CAU group as patients in the CAU group did not receive any feedback from the MEMS and simply used the device for resear ch purposes; and 4) by using the UK tariff to value the EQ-5D-5L health states. Results Baseline characteristics A total of 102 patients were included in the study, 52 of whom were in the intervention group. A large part of the patients reported to have an unpaid job or to be unemployed (61.8%). There was, however, a significant difference between the intervention group and the CAU group, indicating the intervention gr oup had significantly more patients who had a paid job (p=0.02). Furthermore the interventio n group had a significantly higher score on the ESES (p=0.002). Apart from employment rate and ESES score, no other baseline differences were found (see Table 10.1). At baseline, health care costs and patient & family costs were similar between both groups. Productivity costs were, however, high er in the intervention group, leading to higher costs overall in the intervention gr oup compared to the CAU group (i.e. \u20ac3,338 versus \u20ac2,030). Although the two (95%) confidence intervals of total costs overlap marginally, a baseline correction was made. Un it prices are presente d in Supplementary Material S10.1. Clinical effectiveness There was a significant difference at baselin e regarding ESES-scores (p=0.024). Hence, significance testing at follow-up was performe d based on mean change scores; this did not reveal significant differences between gr oups at 3 or 6 months' follow-up. Mean adherence rates over 6 months, as measured with the MEMS, were 63.7% for the CAU group and 75.9% for the interventio n group, which was not shown to be a significant difference. Adherence decreased s lightly over time, resu lting in an adherence rate of 71.05% at 12 months for the interventio n group. In total, 18% of the subjects in CAU group and 4% of the subjects in the inte rvention group did not initiate the MEMS cap and were excluded from the analyses (r esulting in 94 patients, 44 CAU group and 49 intervention group). Patients who were lost to follow-up or who did not used the MEMS caps were considered as non-adherent. Utilit y scores derived from the EQ-5D-5L did not show significant differences at any of th e follow-up measurements. Total QALYs at 6 months were 0.41 for both the interventio n group and the control group using Dutch tariffs.

However, at 3 months follow -up the intervention group had significantly higher QOLIE-31p scores (p=0.035). Total dise ase-specific QALYs, as derived from the QOLIE-31p, were significantly higher in the intervention gr oup (0.34) compared to the CAU group (0.32) at 6 months' follow-up w ith a p-value of 0.041, and at 12 months' follow-up (p=0.048). Scores on the visual analogue were significantly different at 12 months' follow-up (p=0.024). When adjustin g for baseline differences, no significant differences were found between groups. Tabl e 10.2 presents a detailed overview of the clinical effectiveness data. Cost-effectiveness The intervention costs were \u20ac422 and \u20ac648 for the intervention group at 6 and 12 months' follow-up and \u20ac95 for the control gr oup. The intervention costs for the control group were mainly protocol driv en costs attributable to the MEMS bottle. At 6 months, total costs were higher for the intervention gr oup (\u20ac4,491) compared to the CAU group (\u20ac4,142). At 12 months, total costs were \u20ac9314 for the intervention group and \u20ac8189 for the CAU group. Total costs at 12 months' foll ow-up adjusted for baseline differences were \u20ac9014 for the intervention group and \u20ac8495 for the CAU group (see Table 10.3). Looking at the ESES, the combination of effe cts and costs resulted in an ICER of \u20ac54 per point increase in ESES-score at 6 mont hs and \u20ac1105 per point increase in ESES score at 12 months' follow-up. Concerning adherence , the intervention resulted in an ICER of \u20ac88 per percentage of adherence increase at 6 months. When looking at the QALYs (Dutch tariff), an ICUR of \u20ac8,272 per QALY gain was found at 6 months' follow-up and an ICUR of \u20ac15,144 per QALY 12 months' follow-up. Results of the bootstrap replications of the ICERs/ICURs are presented in Figure 10.2. This figure presents the differences in costs and effects between the MCI and CAU for each bootstrap replication (1000 times). The probability that the MCI is cost-effectiv e given different ceiling ratios, as presented in CEACs, is shown in figure 3. At a willin gness to pay \u20ac2,000 per point increase on the ESES score, the probabilities of the MCI be ing cost-effective is 69% and 52% at 6 and 12 months' follow-up, respectively. In terms of QALYs, if one would be willing to pay \u20ac50,000 per QALY gained, the probability that the MCI would be cost-effective is 74% at 6 months follow-up and 76% at 12 months follow-up (see Figure 10.3).

This resulted in an ICER of \u20ac48 per score improvement on ESES scor e at 6 months, an ICER of \u20ac105 per score improvement on ESES score at 12 months, and an ICER of \u20ac147 per percentage increase in adherence. In terms of QALY s, this led to an ICUR of \u20ac30,989 per QALY gained at 6 months' QALY gained at 12 months' follow-up. Discussion Cost-effectiveness estimates appeared to be promising. Unlike, QALYs, there is no willingness to pay threshold known for improvement on the ESES score, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions regardi ng cost-effectiveness. Regarding QALYs, considering a threshold of \u20ac50,000 per QALY gained, the probability that the MCI was cost-effective was estimated to be 74% at 6 months' follow-up and 76% at 12 months' follow-up. The MCI did not lead to significantly higher le vels of self-efficacy. Furthermore, EQ-5D-5L score did not differ between the two groups. To tal costs were higher for the intervention group compared to the control group. The use of baseline corrections impacted the results as demonstrated by the sensitivity analyses. However, the imbalances in importan t baseline characteristics made us consider adjusting for them. It has been argued that im balances in baseline meas ures could in fact matter without being statistically significant36 and that baseline adjustments provide more precise estimates of a treatment e ect.35 Furthermore, although in contrast to, for example, QALYs, baseline costs are not part of the total costs, one could still expect that patients' baseline costs will influence costs during the study. Hence, it is important to investigate this influence.34 The lack of effectiveness of the MCI on the ESES and EQ-5D-5L may be explained by several factors. Of course, it co uld be that the intervention is not effective. However, this may be too short-sighted. For example, it is also possible, given the nature of the intervention, that we simply did not capture the effect or that the instruments were not sufficiently responsive. The first argument applie s mainly to the ESES, as self-efficacy has been shown to increase in other studie s investigating self-management programs.37 The latter argument applies in particular to the EQ -5D-5L, which has previously been reported not to be responsive in patients with epilepsy.4 However, it has been argued that rules of inference are arbitrary and irrelevant to the decisions which clinical and economic evaluations claim to inform. Claxton et al. (1999) argued that, if the objective is to maximize health gain for a given budget, decisi ons should be based only on the mean net benefits irrespective of whether diffe rences are statistically significant.38 This is because one of the mutually exclusive alternatives must be chosen and this decision cannot be Chapter 10 216 postponed. By accepting the arbitrary rules of inference, one will im pose costs which can be measured in terms of resour ces or lost health benefits.38 This study is not without its limitations. First, a MCI tailored to a specific age-group may be more effective. For example, it has been shown that adults with lower education and income may be poorer self-man agers than those with higher income and/or educational levels.39 Second, due to the fact that the interven tions consist of multiple components, it is difficult to determine which aspect contributed to the effects found in th is study. In addition, although the CAU group did not receive fee dback on their usage, both the CAU and the intervention group received the MEMS whic h means CAU deviated from standard care. Third, patients were instructed to use the smartphone application \"Eppy\" (Epilepsy Foundation, the Netherlands). Due to financia l constraints, Eppy was not maintained and updated, which meant that only a minority of the patients were able to use the app. Moreover, it was discontinued in early 2015 an d removed from both the App store (Apple Inc., USA) and the Google Play store (Google Inc., USA). Fourth, the sample size of this study was based on a standard deviation fo r the ESES score of 7 points. However, the actual standard deviation found in this study was >30 points, which may have resulted in a decrease in study power. This may be a reason why we did not find statistically significant results. Lastly, with regard to the 12 month sensitivity analyses, the CAU group was only followed for 6 months and the results extrapol ated to 12 months. This implies that the 6-month follow-up of the CAU group was sufficie nt to obtain a representative estimation of 12 month follow-up costs. In conclusion, although there was no stat istically significant difference found after baseline adjustments, cost-effec tiveness estimates appear to be promising. It has been argued that rules of inference are arbitrar y and perhaps less relevant to the decisions which clinical and economic evaluations aim to inform. Further research should try to determine which factors contribute to an increased QoL in patients with epilepsy.

Chapter 10 Discussion and summary 223 General discussion General conclusion and discussion 225 11 General conclusion and discussion As described in the introducti on, this thesis, which is stru ctured around six research questions, consists of two main parts. The fi rst part presents method ological aspects and preference-based studies of health technolo gy assessment in epilepsy. The second part provides a more specific focus on economic evaluations within epilepsy. The present chapter opens with the main co nclusions and answers to the re search questions, with some elaboration, followed by a more detailed discussion of preference studies, self- management and economic evalua tions in epilepsy. Directions for further research are also indicated. 1. Main results of the thesis 1.1 What preferences do peopl e have regarding epilepsy diagnostics and the valuation of clinical manifestations of epilepsy? In chapter two, patients' pref erences were obtained for brain imaging techniques in the primary diagnosis of epilepsy. Using a discrete -choice experiment (DCE), it was shown that patients attached importance to attributes other than psychometric properties (e.g. sensitivity; in this study, the chance of additional examination). For example, patients indicated preferring movement freedom during a registration. Using the relative importance weights for the attributes valued in this stud y, one could hypothetically compare different diagnostic modalities, for instance, MEG and EEG. Although MEG is often considered to be more patient friendly, it was demonstrated that this is not necessarily the case. Furthermore, the study shows that preference s could differ substantially between subgroups and even between individuals within a subgroup, given the considerable heterogeneity within the parameters. This highlights the importance of accounting for individual preferences in medi cal decision-making.1 In chapter three, preferences of the genera l public were obtained to determine utility values for several clinical manifestations of ep ilepsy, or for what is usually referred to as health states. This study provided a utility-f unction for epilepsy health states and gave insights into the relative impact of clinical outcomes in epilepsy on quality of life. Furthermore, it clearly demonstrated that seiz ure severity had a greater negative impact on utility compared with the attributes seizure frequency and side-effects.2 Although outcome valuations used in cost-u tility analyses can be given by different groups, generally either patients or the genera l public (i.e. community preferences), which population should be preferred is still a ma tter of controversy One possible concern (with the use of community preferences) is patient-discrimination.3 This concern is supported by the prospect theory (PT) which states that people assess outcomes not according to an absolute standard, but rather according to a relative one, called a reference level.3 Chapter 11 226 According to this theory, people allocate larger utilities for im provements near the reference level, but small utilities for im provements far from the reference level.3 Community preferences could, therefore, underestimate utility gains in people with a more severe health state, since the community is supposed to be in relatively good health. So the differences between pre- and post-treatment u tilities would be larger for patients than for community members. This is especially the ca se when a treatment causes only a slight improvement in the patient's health status, wh ich could mean a lot to the patient but does not seems to be of importance in the eyes of community. On the other hand, community preferences co uld be distorted, because community fails to predict that a patient adapts to their health state. This phenomenon is called impact bias, which implies that people misinterpret the hea lth state they are in when evaluating various health states.4 Impact bias could, therefore, cause an overestimation of utility gains in patients. This can also be explained by PT. Based on PT, we would expect that the measured utility for a disease state would be lower for the healthy population than for the sick population, because the healthy population has a higher reference level, and so any sick health state would be perceived as a loss.3 A review by Neumann et al.5 found that several studie s showed that individuals afflicted with a specific disease tend to value their health state more highly than those who have not experienced the condition, although th ey also found studies reporting similarities in preferences between patients and non-patient s. Internationally, however, health state valuation is mostly based on preferences of the general public; patients' preferences usually only involve (new) medications or a trea tment which they will actually undergo. For example, valuation sets for the widely us ed EuroQol-5D-5L are based on community preferences6 and the same holds for the valuations sets of the SF-36 and HUI Mark II.7,8 Another frequently used argument for using commu nity preferences is that societal resource allocation decisions should be made by appealing to population-based community values.9 However, in Sweden, patient preference s are preferred and included in their General Guidelines for Economic Evaluation s from the Pharmaceu tical Benefits Board.10,11 A recent review by Versteegh & Brouwer on patient and general public preferences concluded that although the properties of both perspectives have been extensively discussed in the literature, there does not seem to be any conclusive or theoretically sound justification for disregarding either perspec tive, as has been argued before. In addition, they emphasize that health economic guidelines should require QALYs based on both patient and general public preferences.11 1.2 How do generic quality of life instruments compare to epilepsy- specific quality of life instruments? In chapter four, we have compared a generic quality of life instrument with an epilepsy- specific quality of life instrument. Generic qu ality of life instruments are designed to be applicable across all diseases or conditions, across different medical interventions and across a wide range of populations. Conditi on-specific quality of life measures are General conclusion and discussion 227 11 designed to be relevant to a particular co ndition or state, in this case epilepsy.12 The use of generic instruments is important for policymakers; however, the lack of sensitivity of these instruments may raise concerns. The aim of this study was to compare th e responsiveness of the QOLIE-31p and the EQ-5D-5L in epilepsy and to predict EQ-5D- 5L values based on QOLIE-31p scores by means of a mapping function. This study demo nstrated moderate correlations between the two instruments when looking at the total scores. This may im ply that both instruments are measuring the same concept only to some exte nt and impose conceptual differences as to what is actually measured. The EQ-5D-5L sh owed substantially high ceiling effects and was less responsive than the QOLIE-31p. Furt hermore, this study attempted to derive a mapping function which could be used in (f uture) economic evaluations to map QOLIE- 31p data to EQ-5D-5L values. Such a mapping function would be useful for researchers who want to calculate quality-adjusted life year s (QALYs) but who do not have results of a generic quality instrument (such as the EQ-5 D-5L). Using different mapping functions, the highest adjusted R2 we were able to regress was 0.2 65 using an OLS model with squared terms. This led to a mean absolute e rror of 0.103. However, this adjusted R2 value and the others found in this study were relatively sma ll, which indicates a po or fit of the mapping models to predict EQ-5D-5L outcomes. Hence the usefulness of this mapping function in economic evaluations is questionable given the relatively large mean absolute error and poor model fit. This may stress the need for other approaches. Generic quality of life instruments are import ant for determining the utility of a person which can then be used to calculate QALYs. A u tility can be seen as expressing the value of a particular health state on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 represents \"worst imaginable health state\" and 1 \"perfect health\". Utilities can then be used to calculate quality adjusted life years (QALYs), by multiplying the utility of a health state by the time spent in that particular health state. Without going into much detail, utilities for most generic quality of life instruments are elicited according to the Mu lti Attribute utility Theory, an extension of the Expected Utility Theory of Von Neumann and Morgenstern.13 Three main axioms must be taken into account before it can be called a utility, namely, 1) the individual has transitive preferences; 2) the individual agrees that the deci sion problem is unchanged by substituting one outcome by an equally preferred outcome; and 3) the individual is able to express choices when uncertain.14 Hence, for example, the va luation set (or tariffs) is based on choice experiments (i.e. preferences) carried out in the general population in which utilities for all EQ-5D-5L health states are elicited by using time trade-off experiments (see chapter 2), discrete choice experi ments (see chapter 1) or standard gamble approaches (not covered in this thesis). Hence, a preference-based measure is a questionnaire with a scoring function design ed to weight the responses according to preferences for certain health conditions over others.15 Theoretically, if a condition-specific quality of life instrument were used for the calc ulation of QALYs, the valuation set should be constructed according to the same principles. As the QOLIE-31p is not constructed in this way, theoretically it cannot be used to calculate QALYs. Moreover, given the limited responsiveness, low correlation s and the poor model fit of the mapping functions between Chapter 11 228 the QOLIE-31p and the EQ-5D-5L, one coul d argue that there is a need for the development of condition-specif ic preference-based measures which can then be used to calculate condition-specific QALYs as a supplement to economic evaluations.16 The development of such condition-specific, prefer ence-based quality of life instruments may ensure that the benefits of health-care interventions are ad equately reflected in QALY estimates for economic evaluations not only in epilepsy but for all conditions.17 There is, however, a lack of guidance on how to deal with such condition-specific QALYs in the assessment of economic evalua tions. In addition, some argue that such measures should only be considered when em pirical evidence disproves the sensitivity of existing generic instruments and empirical evid ence proves the superi ority of the condition- specific measure.15 Hence, it is clear that generic quality of life instruments have their limitations and that solely depending on current existing measures may not be the right way to evaluate health care interventions. Using preference-based condit ion specific measures may overcome some problems associated w ith generic measures, such as responsive issues, but lacks cross program comparability. Including both types of QALYs may be one way forward.16 Another option would be to derive well-conducted and validated mapping functions instead of developing condition-spe cific, preference-bas ed measures, because these mapping functions supposedly to yield utility values comparable to the more frequently used generic instruments.15 As this study demonstrated, the second option is not always achievable. Lastly, other, more extens ive, preference-based generic quality of life instruments, potentially useful in epilepsy, have been or are currently being developed, such as the AQoL-8D or the ICECAP.18,19 However, the psychometric pr operties of both instruments within the field of epilepsy have yet to be determined. Overall, more research is needed in this area as responsiveness issues may directly im pact resource allocation decisions. 1.3 To what extent is a novel method to elicit preferences used in health care? The past few decades have seen an increase in awareness of the value of shared decision- making between physicians and patients. Ther e seems to be a greater need for a more patient-centered approach in delivering hea lth care. Best-worst scaling (BWS) is a relatively novel method for eliciting preference s. The overview of BW S provided in chapter 5 sheds some light on its ap plication in health care.20 It is important to point out that about two-thirds of studies were pe rformed in the last two years. A total of 62 BWS cases were identified and to briefly recap, the three types were: 1) 26 BW S object cases, in which the researcher is interested in the relative values associated with each of a list of objects; 2) 29 BWS profile cases, in which the choice set has the structure of a single profile (multiple attributes). The respondent is, howeve r, not required to consider the value of the profile as a whole, but has to consider the at tribute-levels that describe it; and 3) 7 BWS multi-profile cases, which require a respondent to choose the worst (least attractive) profile as well as the best (most attracti ve) one in the current choice set. General conclusion and discussion 229 11 This increase in published BWS studie s may indicate a greater awareness of advantages of the BWS method for eliciting pref erences in health care . It is apparent that BWS, especially the object case, is capable of incorporating a larger se t of items or factors - on average 17 (Mdn=12) - compared to DCE. In DCE, the average number of included factors was estimated to be 4 to 6.21 BWS object case can be es pecially useful if one is interested in a list of items that is difficult to reduce to a number acceptable for other conjoint analyses, such as a DCE. Furthermore, compared to the DCE, BWS (especially object and profile cases) may be less cognit ively burdensome. For ex ample, Potoglou et al. (2011) stated that best-worst tasks take advantage of an individual's propensity to identify and respond more consistently to ex treme options and BWS ta sks seem easier to understand.22 It is important to bear in mind that the tw o methods are complementary. The goal of the study described in chapter 5 is merely to provide an overview of the application and current practices in healthcare, not to state that one method is superior. The strength of the DCE is, however, that it provides a comparison and trade-off of entire profiles, in contrast to BWS where respondents only focus on spec ific items or attributes. In a BWS multi- profile, respondents are also supposed to make a trade-off between entire profiles, but the need to elicit the best and worst alternativ e has the limitation of comparing a minimum of three profiles per choice task. Moreover, as there are only minor differences between BWS multi-profile case and DCE, the former ha s often been referred to as BWS DCE.23,24 This overview may increase aw areness of BWS among research ers in the field of health technology assessment and provid e insights into the various aims. However, although it presents an overview of current (and past) practices, these are in no way recommendations for best practices. As DCEs have been used in health care for a relatively long period compared to BWS, a considerable amount of methodological guidance has been developed, especially during the last decade.25-27 Some important methodological issues remain a challenge (e.g. sample size calculatio ns), but most topics, such as designing and analyzing DCEs, have been elaborated on. M\u00fchlbacher et al. have published a short series on theoretical foundations and method ological considerations when conducting a BWS (such as design issues),28,29 a guidance protocol has, ho wever, yet to be developed. This would improve standardiza tion and the comparability of BWS and may also enable more researchers to perf orm such studies. 1.4 How to appraise economic evaluations and the applicability of an economic evaluation to a particular setting? Cost-effectiveness has become increasingly impo rtant within health ca re and hence, within epilepsy. For example, the updated version of the Dutch clinical practice guidelines for epilepsy has recently been extended to include economic evidence.30 When using economic evaluations for decision-makin g or clinical practice guideline (CPG) development, it is essential to determine their quality and a pplicability. For this purpose, many quality and transferability checklists have been developed over the years and one Chapter 11 230 may not be able to see the wood for the trees. Chapter 6 offers some guidance in choosing appropriate checklists. In health economics, a subdivision is often made between partial and full economic evaluations. The term \"f ull economic evaluation\" refers to the comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both costs (resource use) and consequences (outcomes, effects).31 Full economic evaluations can vary in a variety of aspects, all of which can affect the quality of the evaluation and hence bias the results. Full economic evaluations are consid ered to be the best strategy for answering efficiency questions as both the costs and effects are derived from the same population.31 Consequently, most checklists focus solely on full economic evaluati ons. Partial economic evaluations are referred to as studies focusi ng only on costs and/or resource use. However, in (clinical practi ce) guideline development or policy-making, and/or in the absence of full economic evaluations, one might consider a partial economic evaluation (e.g. costs analysis or budget impact anal ysis). This may represent important an intermediate stage in our understanding of th e costs and consequences of health services programs.31 Similar to clinical studies, biases in (full) economic evaluations can occur as a result of poor methodological quality, which could impac t the validity of the results in terms of generalizability or transferability.32 In chapter 6, several risk of bias checklists have been evaluated. In general, it is concluded that, for full economic evaluations, one should use the CHEC-extended33,34 or the BMJ checklist.35 Furthermore, in cases where one is specifically interested in model-based economic evaluations and if the expected number of included studies is low (e.g. <10 studies), the Philips checklist36 could be used. If the expected number of included model-based economic evaluations is high (e.g. >10 studies), the ISPOR checklist is likely to be more convenient.37 Lastly, to determine the transferability of a study (e.g. whether the re sults of a study are transferable to another country or setting), the Welt e checklist should be used.38 These recommendations show that there is a difference in the assessment of trial-based economic evaluations and model- based economic evaluations. Also they imply that if one is willing to conduct a systematic review of ec onomic evaluations, one should use at least two checklists to determine the risk of bias (given that one would include both model- and trial-based economic evaluations). By using tw o different checklists, quality scores between model- and trial-based economic evaluatio ns are difficult to compare. Hence, as mentioned in chapter 6, there is a need for th e development and validation of a single tool to assess and grade the risk of bias of both trial- and model-based ec onomic evaluations in health care. Such a 'risk of bias assessment tool' could make a substantial contribution to the field of health economics. It would assist end-users of economic ev aluations to navigate the vast body of literature, and help produc ers of such studies to establish a clearer standard, potentially encouraging higher quality and greater rigor.39 General conclusion and discussion 231 11 1.5 What are cost-effective treatme nts and strategies in epilepsy care? The review described in chapter 7, which prov ides an overview of all published economic evaluations within epilepsy, highlighted po tential knowledge gaps regarding economic evidence in epilepsy. The majority of the st udies focused on the co st-effectiveness of anti- epileptic drugs (71%), whereas the cost-effectiv eness of other treatments, such as epilepsy surgery, the ketogenic diet, deep brain stimulations or self-management was studied significantly less often. Furthermore, this re view stressed the need for a more standardized approach to conducting economic evalua tions within the field of epilepsy. Two of these less investigated treatments , namely the ketogenic diet and self- management, were examined in chapters 8, 9 and 10. The first study (chapter 8) compared the ketogenic diet with care as usua l in children and adolesc ents with intractable epilepsy. Although the ketogenic group sh owed more clinical improvements (not significantly after 16 months) there was no di fference in quality of life between the two groups. Hence, at a maximum WTP of \u20ac50,000 per extra QALY, there was only a 25% chance that the KD would be cost-effective. Ho wever, the KD may still be considered to be a potentially important treatment for children with intractable epilepsy in patients who respond, given the large number of drop-out s resulting in a retention rate of 58%. In patients who were able to tolerate the KD, results were promisin g. Moreover, the KD showed significant shor t-term (4 months) improvements on clinical outcomes such as the number of responders defined as a seizur e reduction of 50% or more. This can be substantiated in the present study by the (positive) clinical outcomes for patients maintaining the diet. Further research should focus on determining which patients are more likely to benefit and tolerate th e KD in order to improve the (cost-) effective application of the diet. The second study compared a multi-component intervention (MCI), aimed at increasing self-management skills (i.e. incr ease self-efficacy and concordance), with care as usual in adult patients with epilepsy. This interventio n consisted of 1) group sessions; 2) the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS; Aardex Ltd., Switzerland); 3) a smartphone application \"Eppy\" (Epilepsy Fo undation, the Netherlands); an d 4) an internet accessible patient database. The group sessions involved groups of 3-5 patients and family members and/or friends. This study found an ICER of \u20ac54 per point increase in ESES-score at 6 months, and \u20ac1105 per point increase in ESES score at 12 months' follow-up. Concerning adherence, the intervention resu lted in an ICER of \u20ac88 per percentage of adherence increase at 6 months. When looking at the QA LYs, an ICUR of \u20ac8,272 per QALY gain was found at 6 months' follow-up and an ICUR of \u20ac15,144 per QALY gained at 12 months follow-up. Considering a threshold of \u20ac50,0 00 per QALY gained, the probability that the MCI is cost-effective is estimated to be 74% and 76% at 6 and 12 months' follow-up, respectively. No statistically significant di fferences were found in outcome measures between groups. It has, however, been argued that decisions should be based only on the net benefits, irrespective of whether differences ar e statistically significant, and that rules of Chapter 11 232 inference are arbitrary and entir ely irrelevant to the decision s which clinical and economic evaluations claim to inform.40 As self-management is a bro ad term used to describe the patients' ability to self- manage his or her disease, the effect of inte rventions aimed at increasing self-management skills, such as the MCI in this study, may have varying clinical manifestations. In addition, self-management programs vary in content and manner of delivering information, thus limiting comparability with other studies. In the ZMILE study (chapter 9&10), the effectiveness of the MCI was assessed usin g several outcomes such as medication adherence, self-efficacy, and (proactive) coping . Consequently, the effect of the MCI may have been spread among the different ou tcome measures. A recently developed instrument, the Adult Epilepsy Self-Manageme nt Measurement Instrument (ESMMI), was designed to provide an overall effectivene ss measure for self-management interventions.41 The ESMMI is a synthesis of 11 instruments, including the ESES42 and the QOLIE-31p.43 The use of such an instrument, specifically de signed for an intervention such as the MCI, would have been a great addition to the current study. 2. Further elaboration on health technology assessment in epilepsy This thesis makes the case for HTA being a broad discipline covering, among others, preference studies, partial and full economic evaluations, and (c linical) effectiveness s t u d i e s . T h o u g h c o n s i d e r e d t o b e p a r t o f an overall discipline, these different sub- disciplines are often not synthesized into an ov erall health technology assessment. If one is willing to move towards patient-centered and efficient care , some hurdles need to be taken to actually achieve this goal. Certain topics fo r discussion emerge from this statement. For example, preference studies are an importan t way to achieve insight into preferences. More research is, however, necessary to ex amine ways to incorporate the results into clinical or policy decision-m aking. Hence it is important to elaborate on methodological approaches to synthesize prefer ences in the decisi on-making process an d to determine to what extent this is currently being done (see below). Furthermore, it is often argued (also in th is thesis) that helping patients to help themselves (self-management) may be a promis ing way to improve efficient use of health care resources. Hence, this chapter will ex pand on whether there is a need for self- management in epilepsy. The last topic I wo uld like to address regarding patient-centered and efficient care, is the quality and quantity of economic evaluations. Decent policy decisions can only be made on the basis of high quality research. It is , therefore, important to examine the quality of studies and to be able to differentiate when making decisions. Furthermore, the emphasis on patient-centered care also entails looking at the quantity of research and, more specifically, the represen tation of several (vulnerable) groups in research. According to professi onal and ethical codes for soci o-economic rese arch in the information society (the RESPECT Code of Practice44), vulnerable groups have the right to General conclusion and discussion 233 11 be protected from (potentially) harmful clinic al studies, but also have the right to be represented in clinical studies. When iden tifying research gaps, one should take the treatment of under-represented vulnerable groups into account. These groups should be appropriately treated in all aspects, from rese arch design to reporting the findings to ensure they are not excluded. At the same tim e, they should not be over-researched to avoid participation becoming a burden for them.44 2.1 Preferences in clinical decision-making A large part of this thesis focusses around pref erence studies. It may, however, be unclear how (patients' or physicians') preferences are used in decision-making. During the last few decades, there has been a move toward s including patients in decision-making45-48 and growing acceptance that the trade -offs made by actual patients differ from those of clinical experts.49 In addition, patient preferences have b een shown to have a direct impact on the outcome of an intervention via psychologi cal factors or indirectly via patient adherence/compliance rates.50 One way of incorporating pa tients' preferences is to include these in the clinical de cision-making during consultati on. It has been argued that there is a need for more research into deci sion-support mechanisms to enable patients to become informed participants in treatment decisions.51 For example, this could be achieved using decision aids during clinical consultations. According to the International Patient Decision Aid Standards Collaboration (I PDAS), decision aids are tools designed to help people participate in decision -making about health care options.52 They emphasize that decision aids do not advise people to choose one option over another, nor are they meant to replace practitioner consultation. Rath er, they prepare patients so that they can make informed, values-based decisions with their practitioner. A Cochrane review by Stacey et al.53 found that decision aids appeared to have a positive effect on patient- practitioner communication, satisfaction with the decision, decision-making process, and/or preparation for decisi on-making. Those exposed to a decision aid were either more satisfied, or there was no difference between the decision aid versus comparison interventions.53 Using a decision aid, it is possible to match patient's preferences to the treatment choices. One such aid is an option grid, a piece of paper with questions and answers which is used to enable communication between patie nts and physicians when deciding what would be the most suitable treatment(s) or test(s).54 Option grids are relatively simple and have recently been developed for people with epilepsy and are currently being tested in clinical practice. Another form of decision aid is a decision support system (DSS) which can be based on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). In MCDA, patients' preferences regarding benefits, risk factors and other attributes of the treatment are weighed. This 'weight' represents the importance of the attribute for the decision. When these weights are combined with evid ence about the specific attributes, the available treatments can be ranked fr om most preferred to least preferred.55 The BWS and Chapter 11 234 DCE methods described above fulfill these criteria and are often labeled as MCDA techniques. DSSs based on MCDAs have been developed and used in other diseases. For example, the web-based online de cision support platform Annalisa\u00a9 has been used as a DSS for patients regarding pr ostate cancer screening,56 Down's syndrome screening,57 and contraceptive choices,58 This DSS used a simple expected value algorithm to calculate a score for each option by taking into acco unt the individual's pr eferences for different criteria (as importance weights) and the eviden ce for the performance of each option on each criterion.56 Although a direct relation between the use of such a DSS and clinical outcomes is lacking, in all three studies, th e tool was regarded as being user-friendly (e.g. ease of use, usefulness, unde rstandable) and valuable in supporting decision-making by both patients and clinicians. 2.2 Preferences in resourc e allocation decisions The use of patients' preferences in resource us e allocation is also important, but practical guidance on how to incorporate preferences in existing HTA processes is often unclear.59 However, it has been argued that individual patient preferences for treatments should be taken into account over the entire spectrum of medical care, includ ing the development of new treatment. An example of a possible implicatio n of this is the case of anti-psychotics for schizophrenic patients.60 The literature suggests that nega tive side-effects are responsible for poor adherence of schizophrenics to anti-p sychotics. However, a small study, in which participants were asked to rank the importan ce of medication attributes and effects, showed that patients with schizophrenia actua lly valued how clearly they could think and interact socially more than concerns about side-effects.61 Given this information, reducing the side-effect may not be the most effective wa y to improve adherence. In epilepsy, similar examples can be found. For example, McAu ley et al. (2010) compared practitioners' impressions of patients' concerns with th ose expressed by the patients themselves.62 Although there was an overlap, patients we re concerned more about life issues, and practitioners about clinical issues.62 Most interestingly, patients selected memory as the second-most important concern; this was weight ed much more heavy by them than by their practitioners. However, practiti oners did not see the memory problem as a major concern. This study demonstrated that it is important to epilepsy patients that future treatments should address memory problems, regardless of seizure control. In an attempt to overcome th is problem, Bridges & Jones63 have proposed a framework called patient-based HTA, aimed at changing processes to increase patient participation at all levels of HTA and to promote em powering patients who can make informed decisions.63 Implications of ignoring patients' preferences would cause HTA to be discarded due to irrelevance, or for patients to be non-compliant with any treatment that is seemingly forced upon them. Another me thod, as suggested by Brazier et al.,50 is to make use of a patient-based cost-effectiveness rule co nsisting of a two-part decision process. In this approach, the first part consists of the id entification of the most cost-effective therapy using mean general population values (i.e. th e current rule), then relative to this, the General conclusion and discussion 235 11 identification of those trea tments that are cheaper.50 If a patient prefers treatment B instead of the more cost-effective treatment A, they shou ld be free to choose it, given that their own well-being will be greater unde r treatment B relative to trea tment A and the mean costs are lower. Currently, many decision makers in health care systems are looking into the use of patients' preferences to support decision-mak ing. For example, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has taken patients' preferences into account as one approach to establishing the new scheme of value-based pricing (e.g. by eliciting willingness to pay). Furthermore, the Institut e for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) recommends preference elicitation techni ques to weight the multiple endpoints in assessment processes and in support of health technology decision-making.59 The Evidence and Value: Impact on Decision-Making (EVIDEM) Coll used preference elicitation methods to rank healthcare inte rventions for reimbursement decisions. For example, this study demonstrated that, all el se being equal, an intervention for a severe disease was assumed to have greater overall va lue than an intervention for a mild disease. However, several criteria related to the context of the decision may pl ay a significant role, such as health care system capacity and ba rriers, stakeholder pressures, and ethical principles of resource allocation.64 Despite the increased attention to patients' preferences, no European HTA body is currently using formal preference elicitatio n approaches for regulatory decision-making.59 This stresses the need for further elaboration on methodologies which can be used to integrate patients', physicians', and decision-makers' preferen ces in resource allocation decisions. However, how one should deal with results of preference studies in decision- making remains unclear. 2.3 The need for self-management in epilepsy? During the past decade there appears to have to have been an increase in emphasis on self-management in health ca re. It is important to dete rmine whether this increased emphasis is indeed justified by a need for self-management in epilepsy (e.g. by demonstrated (cost-)effectivene ss). Recently, there have been calls to change the often- used definition of health, defined by the Worl d Health Organization as \"Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-bein g and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\".65 The proposed definition should be more dynamic and focus on patients' ability to self-manage his/her disease: \"Health as the ability to adapt and implement their own control, in light of the physical, emot ional and social challenges of life\".66 The National Institute for Public Health and the Environmen t (RIVM) has forecast that, with the aging population and the increase in life-expectancy, there is an growing emph asis on the capability of chronically ill people to design th eir lives optimally both as far as healthcare and local policy are considered.67 The RIVM also reports that there are people who lack the options and skills they need to control their own lives, usually those with lower levels of education and frail elderly people. They may benefit from additional care and support. Chapter 11 236 A meta-analysis of Chodosh et al.68 looked at self-management programs for arthritis, diabetes, and high blood pre ssure and found that, compar ed with usual care, self- management programs improved glucose and bl ood pressure control in older adults with diabetes and high blood pressure. Self-man agement programs offered only minimal improvement of pain and physical function in older adults with arthritis [68]. Another review by Barlow et al.69 provided an overview of pub lications on self-management in chronic conditions and concluded that, in ge neral, the literature suggested that self- management interventions have a beneficial effect on the well- being of participants, particularly in the short-term . However, long-term effects have been found for self- management interventions. For example, Lorig et al. (2001) examined a Chronic Disease Self-Management Program for patients with heart disease, lung disease, stroke, or arthritis and demonstrated that after 1 an d 2 years of follow-up, outpatie nt visits and health distress were reduced and self-efficacy improved.70 Moreover, for chronically ill frail elderly patients, a 1-year self-management program including physical activity was associated with higher levels of physical activity and overall health status.71 In epilepsy, in addition to the review desc ribed in chapter 7, the Managing Epilepsy Well (MEW) Network has shown the lack of ev idence-based programs for epilepsy self- management despite the fact that, for example, e-Tools are indicated as promising support within epilepsy care.72 Furthermore, the MEW states that self-management skills can help people with epilepsy to take control of th eir health and cope with their day-to-day challenges. The two studies included in the review in chapter 7 deal with completely different interventions and have contradictor y results. The study by Plumpton et al.73 was both less costly and more effective, whereas the study by Noble et al.74 was less effective and more costly. The study described in ch apters 9 & 10 (ZMILE-study) did not find significant effects; however, economic evidence demonstrat ed that the MCI intervention had quite a high probability of being cost-effectiv e. In addition, in their study, Oberj\u00e9 et al. concluded that medication adherence interven tions (one of the components of the MCI described in chapter 9 &10) can be cost-effe ctive. Furthermore, they recommend that proven-effective adherence programs should be subjected to comprehensive economic evaluations.75 Overall, self-management is promising and ha s gained attention over the last decade. So yes, there is a need for self-management in epilepsy. However, the large variation between interventions makes them difficult to compare and to derive (pooled) effectiveness estimates. Future research should aim to id entify self-management program characteristics that predict successful outcomes. Furthermore, as stated by Barlow et al.,69 greater use of peer education may offer a way forward, that not only builds on and values the experiences of people with ch ronic conditions, but may also prove to be cost-effective. Lastly, further research should try to show whether reinforc ements can achieve sustained improvements and what time intervals are mo st cost-effective for such reinforcements.76 General conclusion and discussion 237 11 2.4 The quantity and quality of ec onomic evaluations in epilepsy In order to be able to identify possible know ledge or research gaps, it is important to identify the number, and corresponding quality, of economic evaluations within a specific field. The incorporation of economic evaluations in resource allocation decisions is increasingly becoming embedded in nationa l guidelines. For example, the use of economic evaluations is required by the Na tional Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK77 and used by the National He alth Care Institute in the Netherlands for health technology assessment.78 The healthcare budget is used to promote overall health and to improve productivity and efficiency of healthcare by investments in healthcare facilities (e.g. technolo gies, programs and interventions).79 As the budget is insufficient to cover all healthcare expenses, po licy makers need to create the most cost- effective and health-producing distribution from the limited budget. Evidence-based analyses of interventions and treatments are important for adequate decision-making. This stresses the need for evidence- based economic evalua tions within the he althcare sector. As shown in chapter 7, there is room for improvement when it come s to the conduct of economic evaluations in the field of epil epsy in terms of quantity, quality, and comparability. This may be due to a lack of awareness of economic evaluations among clinicians conducting clinical trials or a lack of knowledge of economic evaluations. For example, despite the long-recognized need fo r QALYs in priority-setting and decision- making and the growing evidence that psycho social and poor mental health have the greatest impact on quality of life,80,81 many studies focus primarily on seizure frequency. As stated by Perucca et al. (2009), \"the lack of investigations towards other clinical factors can be ascribed to the historical belief that seizure frequency is the major determinant of quality of life\".82 Hence, a reference case may prov ide general guidance in conducting economic evaluations w ithin epilepsy and may increase st andardization and comparability between studies. Economic evaluations can vary in a variety of aspects, all of which can affect the quality of the evaluation. Hence, to structure the most important aspects, the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) has identified several quality indicators for the appraisal of economic evaluations83: methods of deriving the effectiveness data; measurement of resource data; valuation of the resource data; meas urement and valuation of health benefits (utilities); method of synthesi zing the costs and effects; and the analysis of uncertainty. These quality indicators may prov ide a great basis for developing a reference case specific for epilepsy. Furthermore, as also shown in chapter 7, some groups were underrepresented in the identified studies: children, the elderly or patients with cognitiv e deficits which may give rise to problems such as important information defi cits and a potential lack of applicability of evidence generated from clinical trials to vulnerable populations.84 Next, often overlooked but no less import ant, is the reporting of an economic evaluation. After all, a publication describing a high-quality study could receive a low quality appraisal because vital information is not reported adequately. In 1996, Gold et al.85 developed a checklist, called the U.S. Panel checklist, for reporting clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). This list consists of 38 ques tions specifically related to reporting cost-Chapter 11 238 effectiveness analyses and, although it can be us ed for both trial- and model-based EE, it is more applicable to trial-based EE. An ISPO R taskforce has developed the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Repor ting Standards\" (CHEERS), which gives recommendations for optimizing the repo rting of health economic evaluations.86 These recommendations were developed using a two -round Delphi panel; they include 24 items and accompanying recommendations, some spec ifically for trial-based and model-based economic evaluations. There is, however, currently no reporting guidance available specifically tailored to systematic reviews of economic evaluations. CPGs have a large impact on many health ca re decisions for patients, not only those involving reimbursement. Due to the consta nt and worldwide tension between clinical opportunities and what is financially feasible , there is a need for a critical approach to healthcare expenditure and the place of economic evidence in CPGs. Though recommended, economic evaluati ons (EEs) are not routinely incorporated in clinical practice guidelines.87 Studies investigating the uptake of HTA-studies in clinical practice found that this is generally limite d, especially at the local level.88,89 Until 2014, economic evidence was not incorporated into the Dutc h clinical practice guidelines, which were based on scientific research (c linical trials) supplemented by the expertise of health care professionals and patients. As part of the project \" How to Prepare a Syst ematic Review of Economic Evaluations for Informing Ev idence-based Healthcare Decisions \", (part III is described in chapter 6), an overview of all knowledge and practical information needed to systematically incorporate EE in clinical practice guidelines was provided for CPG developers. This framework included a flowch art containing the different steps of the review process, guidance on the development and selection of search strategies, guidance on selection of different bibl iographic databases, informatio n on how to select and use checklists to appraise the me thodological quality of the studies, information on how to handle transferability and generalizability is sues, guidance on data extraction and data syntheses. It is currently being used to iden tify new articles systematically, to process such articles, and update and expand the Dutch CPG for epilepsy on a yearly basis to include economic evidence. This standardized approach is expected to facilitate the incorporation of EEs in (other) new and existing clinic al practice guidelines. However, despite methodological frameworks, including econom ic evidence in CPG may not be an easy process. For example, with a restricted budget, the use of economic evaluations is always associated with bad news for some parties.88 Moreover, in 2012 when NICE revised the CPG for epilepsy in the UK, the guidelines ca me under fire by several experts who said that they did not reflect clinical experi ence and focused too much on drug cost- effectiveness.90 Although chapter 6 emphasizes the importance of full economic evaluations, partial economic evaluations may be useful for CP G development. While a partial economic evaluation does not directly provide answers to efficiency issues, it is important in offering insights into the (societal) burden of a specific condition. In turn, this can be used for priority setting (e.g. prioritizing resear ch agendas), or to identify fa ctors responsible for relatively high costs which could be subjected to efficien cy research. Partial econ omic evaluation is a General conclusion and discussion 239 11 broadly used term covering a wide range of st udies, such as cost of illness studies and budget impact analyses. Partial economic evalua tions can be useful for policy-makers in a more indirect manner. Especially in the case of CPG development, if little is known about a particular treatment, partial economic evaluations may provide useful results. Transparency and the involvemen t of a broad range of stakeholders (e.g. clinicians but also health economists, insurance companies and patient representatives) are, therefore, important to build sufficient support. 2.5 The role of education in proper and widely applied health technology assessment So far this thesis has highlighted shortcomings and topics for di scussion in the field of HTA, mainly with regard to more advanced method ological aspects Many of the methodologies used in HTA research, e.g. the conduct of tr ial- or model-based economic evaluations and preference-based studies such as DCE or TTO, are well-founded and experts have reached a consensus over the past decades. Hence, there may be an important role fo r increasing awareness and knowledge to achieve wide spread use and uniformity in the conduct of HTA in health care. For example, in a report of the Netherlands Federation of University Medical Centers in 2014 it was cited that \"most clinicians acknowledge that on ly half of the procedures they perform are based on scientific evidence, let alone cost-effectiveness\".91 Moreover, the Dutch Federation of Medical Specialists developed a quality cycle for the successful clinical and cost-effectiveness evaluation of care in which education plays an important role.92 This report also reflects on the view of the Nation al Health Care Institute and the Dutch Hospital Association who want to encourage medical pr ofessionals to increase the involvement of cost-effectiveness in care delivery. This tren d is also observed in other countries. For example, most influential medical groups in the USA are recommending that doctors weigh the costs, not just the effectiveness of trea tments, as they make decisions about patient care.93 Until a few years ago, HTA, and more spec ifically economic evaluation, was not embedded in medical education. However, a taskforce arising from the initiative Modernisering Medische Vervolgopleidingen (Modernization of Continued Medical Education), part of the Dutch Federation of Me dical Specialists, has recently developed a more detailed competence-bas ed approach for continued medical education in which efficiency research is on e of the key components.94 Each competency is subdivided into three layers: 1) basic knowledge, which is relevant for all students; 2) advanced knowledge, which is dedicated to senior stud ents who are looking to gain more in-depth knowledge; and 3) knowledge for talents, which is dedicated to students who want to gain even more in-depth knowledge, possibly in a sub-discipline. For every medical student, an individually tailored education plan, agreed by both teacher and student, is compiled at the start of their education. Th e aim of the taskforce is to provide practical guidance on several competencies instead of solely theore tical descriptions, and to encourage medical teachers to use this competence -based approach nationwide. Chapter 11 240 Embedding economic evaluations within medi cal education is a great way to increase the awareness and possibly the us e of economic evidence in he alth care. Integrating health economics into medical education, for exam ple, encourages an appreciation of why economic factors influence clinical decision-making.95 It has been argued that integrating health economics into medical education enable s doctors to assess the economic value of medical programs, supporting problem-so lving and contributing to health policy analyses.96 In addition, cost considerations by clinicians has been shown to reduce practice variation, ineffectiveness, and wa steful care while improving outcomes and encouraging the use of proven therapies.97 Although the important role of economic evidence in the education of medical specialists has been recommended in the past de cade, this is still only a part of HTA. There may be room for a broader focus on HTA w ithin medical education which would also include preference studies. 3. Concluding remarks & recommendations The aim of this thesis is two-fold; the first part is devoted to methodological aspects and preference-based studies in the health techno logy assessment of epilepsy; and the second part to economic evaluations within epilepsy. In the first part, great emphasis was placed on preference-based studies ra nging from a discrete choice experiment in patients with epilepsy, to a time-trade off study in the ge neral population and a review to examine the use of best-worst scaling in health care. Th e second part discussed the risk of bias assessment for economic evaluations and the results of two economic evaluations. In addition, this part highlighted areas of potentia l research gaps within the field of epilepsy, especially in vulnerable groups such as patien ts with cognitive deficits, elderly patients, and the treatment of (non)convulsive status epilepticus in both children and adults. The distinction between preference-based st udies and economic evaluation was made in both parts to provide structure. However, by presenting these parts as distinct topics, I indirectly contribute to the lack of synthesis of the two disciplines in (policy or clinical) decision-making. Returning to th e title of this thesis, namely \"Health technology assessment in epilepsy; moving towards patie nt-centered and efficient care\" : this may seem contradictory. But although they are presented in this thesis as strictly two scientifically distinct disciplines, integration on a macro- economic level (e.g. resource allocation decision) or micro-economic level (e.g. clinical consultations) is necessary in order to meet the needs of patients, clinicians, and policy makers and to achieve an efficient use of resources. Shared-decision making, involving all relevant stakeholders, constitutes better tailored care and may enhance concordance (i.e. consensual agreement about treatment established between patient and practitioner), not only in patients with epilepsy, but in medicine as a whole. In accordance with Deber (1994), historical views on the relationship between patients and physicians, e.g. that the physician's ro le was to act in the best interests of the patient and to direct ca re and make decisions about treatment on the General conclusion and discussion 241 11 patient's behalf, are no longer sufficient; resp ect for autonomy of the patient is important, necessitating patient participation.98 Several recommendations have emerged from this thesis: The first is to obtain greater insight into meas urement of quality of life in epilepsy as the EQ-5D-5L was shown to lack responsive ness. This may stress the need for the development of a condition-specific prefer ence-based measure which can then be used to calculate condition-specific QALYs as a supplement to economic evaluations. The development of such cond ition-specific preference-based quality of instruments may ensure that the benefits of health-car e interventions are adequately reflected in QALY estimates for economic evaluations. Although the use of the EQ-5D-5L is recommended by the National Health Care Institute, HTA researchers should be careful when using the EQ-5D-5L in epilepsy research. As long as there is no clear answer, it is probably best to use both ge neric and disease-specific instruments. The second recommendation is to investig ate the use and (cos t-)effectiveness of decision aids in clinical decision-making as a way of incorporating patients' preferences in clinical decision-making. Third, related to the second recommendat ion, further research should focus on methodologies which can be used to integr ate patients', physicians', and decision- makers' preferences in resource allocation decisions. There is a need for consensus on how to deal with preferences in resource allocation and clinical decision-making. Fourth, there is a need for th e development and validation of a single tool to assess and grade the risk of bias of both trial- and model-ba sed economic evaluations in health care. Such a 'risk of bias assessment tool' could make a substantial contribution to the field of health economics. In addition , there is currently no reporting guidance available specifically tailored to systemat ic reviews of economic evaluations. Such guidelines might increase tr ansparency and comparability between reviews and make it easier for policy-makers or subsidizin g parties to identify research gaps. Fifth, there is a need for a more stan dardized approach to conducting economic evaluations within the field of epilepsy. There are (current) guidelines on how to conduct economic evaluations in health care ; however, an epilepsy-specific guideline could focus, for example, on preferred c linical outcome measures (i.e. 50% seizure reduction or proportion of seizure-free patie nts), preferred utility instruments (i.e. a more extensive instrument than solely th e EQ-5D-5L), and preferred or basic model structures for model-based economic evalua tions within epilepsy. A reference-case might provide a viable and feasible solution. Sixth, there are potential gaps in know ledge regarding economic evidence in epilepsy. The majority of the studies current ly focus on the cost-effectiveness of anti- epileptic drugs, whereas the cost-effectiven ess of other treatments, such as epilepsy surgery, the ketogenic diet or self-management were studied signific antly less often. In addition, studies on vulnerabl e groups are lacking. Chapter 11 242 Seventh, future research should focus on determining which patient s are more likely to benefit and tolerate the ketogenic diet to in crease a (cost-) effective application of the diet. Eighth further research should attempt to sh ow whether reinforcemen ts in (educational) self-management interventions can achiev e sustained improvements, and which time intervals are most cost-effec tive for such reinforcements. Ninth, it is important to include HTA in me dical education. Currently, more emphasis is placed on economic evaluations, a welcom e development, but the scope could be widened by increasing emphasis on other aspe cts of HTA, such as preference studies. Lastly, given their increased importance, it is recommended that an economic evaluation is always performed when conduc ting a clinical trial. These (piggy-backed) trial-based economic evaluations should be conducted taking into account the latest guidelines provided by the Nati onal Health Care Institute.

Given the rising health care expenditures the past decades in al most all developed co untries, economic evaluations and the accompanied cost-effectiv eness criterion have become an important part of healthcare policy decisions. In ad dition, the increased awareness of patient autonomy, growing acceptance that the trade -offs made by actual patients differ from those of clinical experts, and the changi ng relation between patient and clinician necessitate the need for a more patient-centere d healthcare system. This thesis reports on methodological aspects and preference-based studies in the health technology assessment of epilepsy; and on the availability and quality of economic evaluations within epilepsy. Lastly, this thesis reports on two economic evaluations: one stud y evaluating the cost- effectiveness of the ketogenic diet in children with intrac table epilepsy, and one study evaluating the cost-effectiveness of a multi component self-management intervention for adults with epilepsy. Chapter 1 provides background knowledge re garding epilepsy and highlights relevant concepts within HTA. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder, characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. About 30% of th e patients with epilepsy are not seizure free while being on anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). These patients, with uncontrolled epileptic seizures and in which two or more AEDs have failed, are commonly referred to have refractory or intractable epilepsy. Epilepsy has a large impact on patients' quality of life, their surrounding and society as a whole. Health technology assessment is a broad multidisciplinary field which examines the social, economic, organizational and ethical i ssues of a health intervention or health technology. HTA aims to provide policymakers and clinicians evidence-based choices in health services and patient care. Two central HTA topics in this thesis are preference elicitation and economic evalua tions. Preference elicitation studies try to prioritize and identify preferences from pre-spec ified stakeholders to inform po licy or clinical decisions. Preferences in healthcare are ty pically elicited by using stated preference methods, such as a discrete choice experiment (DCE), best-w orst scaling (BWS), or time trade-off (TTO) exercises. In economic evalua tions one compares both the costs and effects of two (or more) alternative treatments or interventions in a systematic manner to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. This chapter ends with an overview of th e research questions which were used as a basis for this thesis. Chapter 2 describes a DCE to identify to what ex tent important attributes of diagnostic procedures in epilepsy affect preferences for a procedure; 2) to determine the relative importance of these attributes; 3) to ca lculate overall utility scores for routine electroencephalography (EEG) and magn etoencephalography (MEG) recordings. 250 Respondents were asked to make a series of binary choices between two (hypothetical) diagnostic procedures used in epilepsy, based on several attributes which varied in levels. It was demonstrated that MEG is not necessar ily more patient-friendly than a routine EEG in primary diagnostics and, regarding add itional diagnostics, patients had a strong preference for long-term 24h EEG ov er EEG after sleep deprivation. Chapter 3 reports on the results of a time trad e-off (TTO) study in which utility scores were derived for epilepsy health states. In th is study health states, based on clinically important epilepsy attributes (e.g. seizure freq uency, seizure severity, side-effects), were valued by a sample of the Dutch population (N=525) using the TTO method. This study provides a utility-function for transforming c linically relevant epilepsy outcome measures into utility estimates. In addition, it appeared th at seizure severity had the largest impact on quality of life compared with se izure frequency and side-effects. Chapter 4 describes a study in which the respon siveness of and correlation between the EQ-5D-5L and the QOLIE-31P in patients with epilepsy is examined. The EQ-5D-5L showed substantially high ceiling effects and rather small effect sizes (EFs) and standardized response means (S RMs) whereas the QOLIE-31P did not show ceiling effects and also showed small to moderate EFs an d SRMs. Mapping functions to regress QOLIE- 31P values to EQ-5D-5L values did not show an optimal fit with relatively low adjusted R2 values. The results presented in this st udy may emphasize the importance of the development of condition-specifi c preference-based instruments which can be used within the QALY framework and hence incorporated as an important supp lement in economic evaluations. Chapter 5 presents a systematic review of curre nt practice and trends in the use of best-worst scaling (BWS) in health care. The re view aimed to identify, review and critically appraise BWS in health care, an d to identify trends over tim e in key aspects of BWS. A total of 62 BWS were identified of which 26 were BWS object case, 29 were BWS profile case, and 7 were BWS multi-profile case. About two- thirds of studie s were performed in the last two years. Decreasing sample sizes an d number of factors in BWS object case, as well as the use of less complicated analytic me thods was observed in recent studies. The quality of BWS studies was generally acceptable according to the PREFS checklist. The use of BWS has drastically increa sed in health care, especial ly in the last two years. Chapter 6 provides guidance on the conduct of a systematic review of economic evaluations (EEs) for informing evidence-based he althcare decisions. More specifically this paper explains the data extraction process, the risk of bias assessment and the transferability of EEs. Recommendations are based on criteria lists are based on the thoroughness of development, feasibility, overall quality, recommendations of leading organizations, and widespread use. Summary 251 12 Chapter 7 presents a systematic review of ec onomic evaluations of treatments for patients with epilepsy. As well as looking at both pharmacological (anti-epileptic drugs) and non-pharmacological (e.g. epilepsy surgery, ketogenic diet, vagus nerve stimulation) therapies, this review examines the methodological quality of the full economic evaluations included. A total of 40 publications were includ ed in this review. In general studies had an acceptable quality. There was, however, a su bstantial difference in methodology in all included articles which hampered the atte mpt to combine information meaningfully. Heterogeneity between the studies stresses the need to define a reference case. Chapter 8 describes an RCT to examine long-ter m retention rate, clinical outcomes, cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of the Ketoge nic Diet (KD) compared with care as usual (CAU) in children and adolescents with intractable epilepsy from a societal perspective. The KD group resulted in more responders and showed greater im provement on seizure severity. Furthermore, the KD did not lead to worsening of side-effects other than gastro- intestinal problems (only at 4 months' follow-u p). However, as only a minimal difference in QALYs was found between the KD group and th e CAU group, the resulting cost per QALY ratios were inconclusive. Chapter 9 describes the study design of the so-called which combines a self-management/education program with e-Health interventions was developed for adults with epilepsy. The overa ll objective of this study was to assess the (cost)-effectiveness and feasibility of the MCI, aiming to improve self-efficacy and concordance in patients with epilepsy. Chapter 10 reports on the results of the economic evaluations of the ZMILE-study. Objective of this economic evaluation was to compare the cost-effectiveness of the MCI compared to care as usual (CAU) in adult pa tients with epilepsy. The MCI did not lead to significantly higher levels of self-efficacy among adults with epilepsy. Furthermore, EQ-5D- 5L score did not differ between the intervention group and the co ntrol group. A (short-term) effect was found in estimates derived from the QOLIE-31p, but disappeared after baseline correction. Although there was no statistically significant difference found after baseline adjustments, cost-effectiveness estim ates appear to be promising. Chapter 11 discusses the main conclusions and answers to the research questions, with some elaboration, followed by a more deta iled discussion of pref erence studies, self- management and economic evalua tions in epilepsy. Directions for further research are also indicated. It is recommended, among other things, to obtain gr eater insight into measurement of quality of life in epilepsy, on methodologies which can be used to integrate patients', physicians', and decision-makers' preferen ces in resource allocation decisions, a more standardized approach to conducting economic ev aluations within the field of epilepsy, to include HT A in medical education, and to always perform an economic evaluation when conducting a clinical trial. 253 Samenvatting Samenvatting 255 13 Samenvatting Health Technology autonomie hun omgeving, en de samenleving als geheel.

In the Netherlands, in 2015, roughly 180,000 were suffering from epilepsy, with 14,000 newly identified cases. Epilepsy results in va rious clinical manifestations, and seizure severity and frequency vary per person. In 2011, in The Netherlands, costs of epilepsy were about 248.7 million euro, that is 4.8% of the total healthcare budget spend on neurological disorders. The rising healthcare costs attributable to epilepsy in combination with an overall increase in he althcare expenditure nationwide and a constraint healthcare budget stress the need for economic evaluati ons with the ultimate goal to achieve an efficient allocation of resources. To achieve a more efficient and patient-cente red healthcare system, scientific research is only the first step. The second step is to reach out to various stakeholders within the healthcare sector to disseminate the results of scientific research . Scientific knowledge should benefit society as a whole and it is impo rtant to translate the value of scientific work into ideas and solutions societies face. As de fined in the PhD regula tions of Maastricht University in 2013, the process of valorization is \" the process of value creation from scientific knowledge by making it available for societal (or econ omic) use and make it suitable for translation to competitive products, services, or processes \". Hence, this chapter provides an overview of the relevance of this thesis for the most important stakeholders and a description of the dissemination of the findings of this thesis. Relevance for researchers The studies described in this thesis are rele vant for researchers in the field of health technology assessment (HTA). Chapter two and three provide examples of application of a discrete choice experiment and a time trade-off study in epilepsy. Chapter four provides an overview of best-worst scaling in healthcare , which may provide important understandings and insight in to the useful ness of this technique. For researchers focusing on economic ev aluations, especially in epilepsy, the performance of the EuroQol-5D-5L in adults w ith epilepsy described in chapter five is important as it makes them aware of the shortcomings of this instrument. As this instrument is recommended in the national guidelines for conducting economic evaluations, it is important to know what its limitations are wh en using the instrument. For example, these results may give rise to the development of an other generic or condition-specific instrument to examine quality of life in patients with epile psy or these results may highlight the need for additional questionnaires besides the Euro Qol-5D-5L when conducting an economic evaluation in epilepsy. This thesis also provides an overview of the current econ omic evaluations conducted in epilepsy, which indirectly highlights potent ial knowledge gaps. This may guide future researchers in developing (trial-based) econ omic evaluations to close these gaps. In addition, the heterogeneous meth odology may give rise to th e development of a reference 264 case for the conduct of economic evaluation s in epilepsy. Lastly the two trial-based economic evaluations in which the ketoge nic diet (KD) and a multi component self- management intervention are being compared to care as usual add to the current scientific knowledge of both the KD and self-management in epilepsy. Relevance for patients an d healthcare professionals Some of the more methodological studies descri bed in this thesis are not directly relevant for patients and healthcare professionals. However, on the long run, patients and healthcare professionals indirec tly benefit from improved scie ntific methods as it enables researchers to perform high quality studies, re sulting in results with greater certainty. For patients and healthcare professionals, it is relevant to know what the (cost- )effectiveness is of interventions aiming to treat epilepsy is. Although it is unrealistic to assume that every patient or and healthcare pr ofessional is able to understand the studies described in this thesis in detail, the ov erall conclusion should be presented in a comprehensible way. It is important for patie nts and healthcare professionals to be aware of alternative treatments as 30% of the peop le with epilepsy is still not seizure free while being on anti-epileptic drugs. Fo r example, although the retention rate of the KD is rather low, the KD was shown to be of significant impo rtance to those who were still on the diet at the end of the study. The same holds true for the multi component self-management intervention, which (marginally) im proved patients' health status. Relevance for policy makers or healthcare insurance companies For policy makers or healthcare insurance com panies it is important to look at the (cost- )effectiveness of treatments in order to make a deliberate choi ce on what to reimburse. The ZMILE-study demonstrated favourable cost -effectiveness ratios, which may create a positive attitude towards self-management interv entions in general, but more specifically the ZMILE intervention for adults with epilepsy. Regarding the KD, although unfavourable cost-effectiveness ratios were found, the KD was shown to be effec tive on the short term and was demonstrated to be effective for those who were still on the di et at the end of the follow-up period. The low retention rate may make policy makers or healthcare insurance companies willing to investigate the most optimal way of delivering the KD and which patients are best able to benefit from the KD. Dissemination To stimulate the dissemination among fellow resear chers, it is important that the results of all scientific studies described in th is thesis and the studies which ar e not included in this thesis, are being published in internatio nal journals. Of the nine articl es described in this thesis, eight have been published so far and the re maining two are currently under review for publication in international journals. In additi on, the plan is to write and publish a Dutch translation of the economic evaluation of th e ZMILE study in the Dutch journal \"Epilepsie, Valorization 265 V periodiek voor professionals\" to reach out to Dutch neurologists. A publication regarding the short term effects of the KD is already available in this journal. Besides this, a general (Dutch) introduction to economic evaluations in epilepsy was written (and published) in this same journal. Besides (inter)national publications, results of the studies described in this thesis have been presented at (inter)natio nal conferences such as conf erences of the International Society of Pharmacoeconomic Outcomes and Research (ISPOR), the Lowlands Health Economics Study Group (LolaHESG), the annu al CAPHRI day, the annual International Clinical Symposium of Kempenhaeghe, and a congress of the European Academy of Neurology. In addition, all re searchers at epilepsy center Kemenhaeghe are required to present their results (or progress) twice a year for interested staff members of Kempenhaeghe and specially invited (inter)na tional experts in the field of epilepsy. To enhance the dissemination and ease of us e of the KD, a website has made available for people with epilepsy who are currently on the KD. This website contains information regarding the KD and provides daily recipes fo r the three different types of the KD, namely the modified Atkins diet, the MCT-diet, and th e classic KD. These recipes are developed in consultation with a master chef and makes lif e easier for those on the KD. The menus can be found at www.ketogeenmenu.nl. In order to make patients and their parents/caretakers get used to the new meals, workshops were pr ovided. Furthermore, when the patients give their permission, their treating physician and dietician can view their personal data. With this, the dietician and/or treating physician can anticipate on experienced side-effects or the level of ketosis by changing the diet. The development of this new website is sponsored by fonds NutsOhra, CZFonds, Epilepsiefonds and (MCI; the ZMILE-study), with valorization in mind, an advisory gr oup was composed already in the designing phase of the study. This advisory group cons isted of a patient representative, and people from healthcare insurances, and the industry . The advisory group was consulted/informed four times a year and the final results of th e ZMILE-study were pres ented to them. As the ZMILE-study has been completed quite recently, we are now working on the implementation of the intervention. Fortun ately, the first conversations regarding implementation of the MCI are promising and we hope to be able to offer patients the MCI at the Academic Center for Epileptology in M aastricht in the near future. In addition, a process evaluation was carried out (not described in this thesis), to evaluate patients' view on the MCI and to identify poten tial barriers or facilitators for future implementation (such as the availability of the education adherenc e monitoring system and minor adjustments to the intervention protocol). 267 List of publications List of publications 269 P List of publications Peer-reviewed international publications MHJM: An economic evaluation of a multi-co mponent intervention for adults with rpilepsy Cheung de Vries H. 2017.

After finishing secondary education (athenaeum) at Maurick College in Vught, he studied Health Sciences at Maastricht University, obtaining his bachelor's degree in 2011 with a major in movement sciences and a minor in bioregulation & health. His bachelor thesis involved a study to examine the development of executive functions in children. Ben specialized in Health Technology Assessment during the Health Sciences Research master and in 2013 he obtained his master\u00b4s degree with the distinction cum laude. During his one-year internship at the Kempenhaeghe epilepsy institute, as part of the master program, he focused on patients' preferences for epilepsy diagnostics. Extracurricular activities during these years included the membership of the board of the Maastricht student tennis association ('M.S.T.V. Stennis') and playing in a (cover)band. After his graduation he was employed as a junior researcher at the Association of Dutch Burn Centers in the Maasstad Hospital Rotterdam focusing on costs and cost-effectiveness analyses of patients admitted to the burn center. Between 2014 and 2017, Ben was a PhD candidate at the department of Health Services Research at Maastricht University and the department of Research and Development at the Kempenhaeghe epilepsy institute. His research focused on Health Technology Assessment in epilepsy, which included preference studies and economic evaluation of several interventions in the field of epilepsy such as a self-management program to improve self-efficacy, a diagnostic modality in the primary diagnosis of epilepsy, and the effects of a ketogenic diet on seizure frequency in children. In addition, he was an affiliated consultant at Synergus Inc., Stockholm were his main task was to support Stockholm's health economic team with interpretation of data and overall support. During his PhD, he was a visiting lecturer at the Universidad del Rosario of Bogota and the Universidad CES of Medellin, Colombia, and a visiting researcher at King's College London at the department King's Health Economics after receiving the Erasmus+ travel grant. During his PhD he followed courses, among others, on advanced societal cost-benefit analyses, budget impact analysis, pharmacoeconomic modelling, and acquired the university teaching qualification. Furthermore, Ben initiated and prepared research proposals and supervised several bachelor and master students. He is in the board of the ISPOR student chapter of Maastricht University which he founded and is author of several peer-reviewed (inter)nationally published articles with an impact factor (17 published). Currently, he works as a postdoctoral researcher at the department of Health Services Research, Maastricht University and the department of Research and Development at the Kempenhaeghe epilepsy patient-centered, efficient careASSESSMENT IN EPILEPSY Health Technology Assessment in Epilepsy "}
