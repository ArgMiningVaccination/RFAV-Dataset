This is a highly contagious virus that can lead to six kinds of cancer. There are more than 100 types of HPV. Types 16 and 18 are the most common causes of HPV-related cancers. HPV can cause cancer in the mouth, throat, penis, anus, vagina, labia and cervix.A CONTAGIOUS VIRUS You can become infected with HPV through sex or intimate contact. The virus spreads not only through the penis and vagina, but also via the hands and mouth. 80% of people become infected at some point in their lives! Your body is nearly always able to clean up the virus on its own within two years. In the Netherlands, roughly 1,500 people a year develop cancer following an HPV infection.
