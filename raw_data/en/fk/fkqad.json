The alternative medicine world has become a lot more popular over the past couple of decades, which has led to confusion over terms. \"Holistic\" and \"homeopathic\" are two such easily confused terms, but they do mean different things. At the Natural Healing Center of Troy, Dr. Tina Maruszewski and her staff can help guide you through homeopathic and holistic treatments as appropriate. What Are Homeopathy and Holistic Medicine? Holistic treatments are those that focus on the patient as a whole. These treatments take into account not only the need for usual medical options (e.g., an antibiotic for a bacterial infection), but also the need to look at additional factors like lifestyle, alternative modalities like chiropractic treatment, and more. For example, someone who experiences repeated viral infections like colds might take medicine to control symptoms and then revamp their diet and sleep patterns, but they might also address emotional stress and get acupuncture done to shore up their health and prevent another round of infections. Homeopathy is a specific treatment modality, albeit one with a couple of different definitions. Sometimes \"homeopathic remedies\" is used generally to refer to natural remedies derived from plants and minerals, an odd distinction as many regular medicines are derived from those, too. In homeopathic treatments, however, the path from plant to medicine is shorter. Homeopathy is rather old, adding to its image as more natural. One Caution As with any treatment, you must look carefully at who is administering it. You want to go to someone who knows what they're doing. Visiting a professional like a chiropractor or naturopathic doctor who specializes in nutritional counseling and additional treatments can be a good place to start.
