If you're looking for ways to boost your immune system, here are four key steps that we all should be taking right now. Note: None of these things on their own will prevent or cure the coronavirus, of course \u2014 but building a strong immune system is considered one of the best ways to keep yourself as healthy as possible overall. (And don't forget this tremendously important health advice: Wash your hands! Here's a [step-by-step for how to wash your hands correctly](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/wellness/a31225042/how-to-wash-your-hands/)). Get plenty of sleep When you don't get enough sleep, you're more likely to become ill after being exposed to a virus, [research shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3256323/). This is because your immune system works hard while you snooze: It releases proteins that you need in order to fight off an infection or [inflammation](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/uk/health/a28034405/inflammation/). Deprive yourself of a good night's rest and your body may produce fewer of these proteins. So, how much sleep does the average adult need? Seven to 8 hours, experts say. And younger folks need even more: teens should get 9 to 10, and kids in elementary school need 10-plus hours, ideally. Exercise often Here's a good excuse to step away from that desk and move your body a bit: [Studies suggest](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254618301005) that moderate [physical activity](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/fitness/a31478709/home-workout/) may decrease the rates of infection for viruses (including the [flu](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/a29366978/cold-vs-flu-symptoms-treatment/) and pneumonia) and bacterial diseases (though more research is needed in this area). There's also more and more evidence that getting regular exercise has an anti-inflammatory effect on the body (possibly because it may lead to [weight loss](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a31003763/best-diets-2020/)), as well as enhances immune function. \"Exercise helps you maintain a healthy weight, helps produce 'feel good chemicals,' and helps you get a good night's sleep,\" says Dr. Vyas. Try to reduce stress Seems like a tall order these days, with scary news seeming to suck up all the air in the room, but it's important to unplug and take time to calm your system down. When you're under stress, your body gets a code-red response; it lowers activation of systems that the body considers non-essential to, say, fighting off danger, including the immune response. \"Over time, increased stress ups your body's production of cortisol, which can lower your body's white cell count,\" explains Dr. Vyas. \"That's one of the mechanisms your body has to fight infection.\" She suggests [working meditation](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/wellness/g4585/meditation-videos/) and self-reflection into your day. Get some vitamin C This vitamin \u2014 a powerful antioxidant \u2014 seems to have a beneficial impact on the immune system, [research shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5707683/), by enhancing immune cell functions. Foods high in vitamin C include (in order from the highest): [red peppers](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/food-recipes/cooking/g27556089/types-of-peppers/), oranges, kiwifruit, green pepper, [broccoli](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a19500502/broccoli-nutrition/) (higher when cooked), [strawberries](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/g28511617/healthiest-fruits/), Brussels sprouts, grapefruit, tomatoes, and cantaloupe. Other ways too boost your immune system, says Dr. Vyas: Get some sunshine (at least 15 minutes daily, if possible), eat a diet that's healthy and incorporates more [plant-based](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a27241563/plant-based-diet/) foods, avoid excess alcohol, and avoid smoking/drugs.
