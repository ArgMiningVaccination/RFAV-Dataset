As a college student, you're particularly at risk of picking up viruses and bacterial infections from fellow students sharing your space. At the Student Health Center, you can get vaccinated for many diseases. If you've been vaccinated but need a booster, you can get that here too. We also offer tuberculosis (TB) testing and can do titers (blood tests) to check your level of immunity for certain diseases. "}
