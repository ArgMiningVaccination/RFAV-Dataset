Hence, after extensive research, I formulated the Men's Formula Tea for healthy Prostate and well-being of Men. What is Men's Formula? Men's Formula has Quintuple Action and a patent pending product for general wellbeing of Men. The product is a comprehensive phytomedicine product approved by the FDA for Men's Prostate Health & immune booster for men. Men's Formula is also formulated for men who are looking to restore their prostate health as close as possible to youthful levels. Study on Men's Formula Lab study conducted in Ghana at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, KNUST, as part of the FDA requirement for herbal drug registration on efficacy showed the product has high antioxidant activity and would be of significant relevance to the prostate. Key Ingredients based on Science Men's Formula Tea is a combination of over twenty herbs. The mechanism of action of the product is based on these plants. Some of the extracts are: Hibiscus Sabdarrifa, green many more blended together! Mechanism Action It is: - Anti-Inflammatory - Anti-Oxidant - Anti-Androgenic - Virility - Anti-Proliferative Because of the combination of several ingredients, multiple mechanism of action can be responsible and other benefits. In research studies, most of the ingredients have shown in vitro activity, ranging from stimulation of natural killer-cell activity to growth inhibition of different cell lines. There are components that proved estrogenic activity or inhibit 5-alpha reductase. The extracts can induce apoptosis and can suppress cell growth by restricting cell cycle progression. Also Men's Formula combination is not an isolated botanical but bunched up as a single multi-effects remedy. The active, 100% phytomedicine ingredients combined together in Men's Formula have been shown individually in research studies to: - Promote proper prostate size* - Support normal urinary flow and volume* - Encourage healthy libido and sexual response* - Support the natural response to DHT (dihydrotestosterone) reduction* - Assist the natural regulation of 5-alpha-reductase which affects normal prostate size and volume* - Support overall prostate and urinary health* - Restore prostate health as close as possible to youthful levels * - Help promote cellular and immune system health* - *For General Well-being of Men* Scientific Studies on Top Individual ingredients used in Men's Formula Hibiscus Sabdariffa The most important thing about the hibiscus sabdariffa in tea form is that it is one of the richest sources of antioxidants to be used in a beverage. This was revealed in a study published in Nutrition Journal where the investigators elucidated how they developed a comprehensive food database that listed the antioxidant content of more than 3,100 foods, spices, beverages, herbs, and supplements. After analyzing 283 different beverages, hibiscus tea beat matcha green tea when it came to antioxidant content. While green tea is still a very good beverage choice for antioxidants, hibiscus tea tops the list (Carlsen et al 2010) Green Tea Studies show that green tea can help prevent prostate cancer from forming and may also slow the growth of aggressive prostate cancer. Studies show that green tea can also benefit men with BPH and prostatitis. In the study, 60 men with precancerous prostate intraepithelial neoplasia were randomized into either a green tea group or a placebo group. Since it's hard to make a convincing placebo tea, the researchers used green tea pills that were roughly equivalent to about six cups of green tea a day and compared them to sugar pills. Six months into the study, they took biopsies from everyone. In the placebo group, 6 of the 30 men developed cancer by the halfway point and 3 of the remaining 24 developed it by the end of the year. So, 9 out of 30 in the placebo group, about 30 percent, developed cancer within the first year, which is what normally happens without any treatment. In the green tea group, however, none of the 30 men developed cancer within the first six months and only one developed it by the end of the year. Only 1 out of 30 is nearly ten times less than the placebo group. This marked the first demonstration that green tea compounds could be \"very effective for treating premalignant lesions before [prostate cancer] develops.\" Even a year later, after the subjects stopped the green tea, nearly 90 percent of the original green tea group remained cancer-free, while more than half of the placebo group developed cancer. This suggests that the benefits of the green tea may be \"long-lasting,\" with an overall nearly 80 percent reduction in prostate cancer. Green tea is rich in a particular type of polyphenols called catechins that are thought to help an enlarged prostate, in particular the potent epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG).10 A 2017 study published in Life Sciences found that EGCG reduced the over-production of cells which happens during the development of an enlarged prostate.1 Cranberry Taking cranberry products regularly can help support prostate health and may reduce the [symptoms of prostatitis](https://prostate.net/health-centers/prostatitis/prostatitis-symptoms/), an enlarged prostate, and urinary tract infections. Cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon) have been used for centuries for their medicinal properties. Native Americans prized cranberries for their ability to fight bladder and kidney infections, while early settlers in North America used the fruit to treat scurvy. In addition to being an excellent source of vitamin C, cranberries are also high in proanthocyanidins (PACs), which are polyphenol antioxidants. Cranberries for proanthocyanidins present in cranberries are better than B-type proanthocyanidins in preventing the attachment of bacteria to the walls of the urinary tract. This helps prevent and treat infections. [A study published in JAMA](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=366888) in 1994 evaluated the efficacy of cranberry juice for the reduction of bacteria in the urinary tract. The researchers conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 153 elderly women. Baseline urine samples were collected, and six clean-voided urine samples from each woman were analyzed at each one-month interval. The women in one group consumed 300 mL of a commercially prepared cranberry beverage every day, while the control group consumed a non-cranberry beverage that looked the same, tasted the same, and had the same vitamin C content as the cranberry drink. At the end of the study, the researchers concluded that regularly consuming a cranberry beverage reduces the frequency of bacteria in the urinary tract. Cranberries for BPH and Prostatitis Some studies have suggested that using [cranberries for prostatitis](https://prostate.net/articles/cranberry-prostatitis-treatment/) or as a supplement for BPH regularly can help reduce or resolve these urinary symptoms. A study published in the British Journal of Nutrition examined the use of cranberries for urinary symptoms in men with BPH and prostatitis. For six months, researchers administered 1,500 mg of a cranberry extract powder to 21 men. The men were instructed to avoid consuming other foods that are high in phenolic compounds, such as blueberries, cherries, and grapes. The 21 men in the control group were likewise instructed, however the control group did not receive the cranberry extract. After six months, the men who received the cranberry extract reported improvements in the rate and amount of urine flow, urinary urgency, frequency, straining, and nighttime urination. The quality of life scores for that group of men also improved. The men did not report any adverse effects. Turmeric Researchers have found that turmeric and its extract, curcumin, may help prevent or treat prostate cancer. The warm, bitter spice contains anticancerous properties that may stop the spread and growth of cancerous cells. Researchers in one [2015 study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26024538) by [Devassy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Devassy+JG&cauthor_id=26024538) et al discovered that curcumin, which is the particle behind turmeric's color and taste, can restrict several cell-signaling pathways. This may be able to stop or weaken tumor cell production. A separate [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26499200) by Du et al found that curcumin may stop cancer-associated fibroblasts. Fibroblasts are connective tissue cells that produce collagen and other fibers. These fibers may contribute to prostate cancer. According to Huang et al 2015, a combination of curcumin and alpha-tomatine, which is found in tomatoes, can [help stop the growth of cancer cells ](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0144293). It may even speed up the death of cancer cells. Curcumin also has radioprotective and radiosensitizing properties. These may help make tumor cells more susceptible to radiation while also protecting your body against its harmful effects. A [2016 study by](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26771294) Hejazi et al found that curcumin supplementation can improve a person's antioxidant status while undergoing radiotherapy. The study determined that this can be done without hurting the therapy's effectiveness. Hejazi et al 2013 in an [earlier study](http://www.omicsonline.org/a-pilot-clinical-trial-of-radioprotective-effects-of-curcumin-supplementation-in-patients-with-prostate-cancer-1948-5956.1000222.php?aid=19259) determined that curcumin supplementation may lessen lower urinary tract symptoms associated with radiotherapy Fenugreek Johns Hopkins did a study in 2010 demonstrating that fenugreek inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cells (and breast and pancreatic cancer cells as well). It contains selenium and is similar in properties to turmeric. Cinnamon Compounds in cinnamon appeared to lower the growth and spread of prostate and breast cancer cells. These findings suggest some of the compounds in cinnamon may be a therapeutic agent for both the prevention and treatment of cancer. Ginger-Zingiber Officinale Ginger has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiproliferative effects upon tumors making ginger a promising chemopreventive agent. Whole ginger extract holds significant growth-inhibitory and death-inductor effects in a spectrum of cancer cells by interrupting cancer cell-cycle progression, impairing cancer reproduction and modulating apoptosis. Garlic-Allium Sativum Garlic takes care of the immune system and is an antioxidant, antibiotic and anti-inflammatory. Several studies suggest garlic and garlic supplements offer protection against cancer, including prostate cancer. A population-based, case-control study conducted in Shanghai, China, found that men who ate more than 10 grams of Allium vegetables, particularly garlic and scallions, per day were 50% less likely to get prostate cancer than those who ate only a little bit of garlic. The reduced risk of prostate cancer associated with garlic consumption was independent of total caloric intake, body size, and consumption of other foods. This study appeared in the November 2002 edition of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. In another case-control study, a group of researchers from Oxford asked 328 men diagnosed with prostate cancer before the age of 75 and 328 controls to provide details of their dietary habits. The controls were matched for age. Garlic and garlic supplements, along with a few other foods such as beans and peas, were found to have a protective effect against prostate cancer. This study was published in the renowned British Journal of Cancer in 1997. According to Amagase et al (2001), garlic has a wide array of bioactive components. It prevents the formation of free radicals which contribute to the development of cancer and BPH. Garlic was also found to support the body's protective mechanisms to destroy free radicals. Pumpkin seeds Pumpkin seeds contain zinc in high concentration which is needed in the prostate for healthy function. The prostate gland contains zinc in high concentration and low level of it affects men's prostate health. Pumpkin seeds contain 23percent of daily zinc needs. Pumpkin Seed Oil also contains phytosterols, which helps in shrinking the prostate as they inhibit the transformation of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). High levels of DHT are associated with enlarged prostate. Pumpkin seed functions in part to regulate BPH, by inhibiting the prostate enzyme 5-alpha reductase. This protein, in the prostate, converts testosterone into the dihydrotestosterone, or DHT. While this is a normal process necessary for male development and reproduction, excessive DHT can act as a potent growth inducer of prostate cells. Too much DHT can lead to BPH. According to a 2014 study, both pumpkin seed oil and a combination of pumpkin seed oil and saw palmetto oil may improve benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) symptoms. Researchers concluded that pumpkin seed oil and saw palmetto oil are safe and effective alternative treatments for BPH. An earlier study found that pumpkin seed oil could block certain types of prostate growth. The study looked at rats induced with testosterone and the alpha-blocker drug Prazosin. Testosterone is thought to play a role in the development of BPH, although it's not completely clear why. Results of a 2011 study showed that malignant prostate tissue and prostate tissue from men with BPH had significantly less zinc than normal prostate tissue. The study also found an increase in urinary zinc excretion. Zinc is an essential trace mineral that plays a role in many body processes. Pumpkin seeds contain protective compounds called phytosterols, which may be responsible for shrinking the prostate, says Schar. They also contain chemicals that may prevent some transformation of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Pumpkin seed oil also contains carotenoids and omega-3 fatty acids. Research shows that men who have higher levels of carotenoids in their diet have a reduced risk of BPH. A recent study from the Linus Pauling Institute suggests that zinc may protect against the development of prostate cancer. A double-blind placebo-controlled study, published in Nutrition Research and Practice, found that pumpkin seed oil can improve BPH symptoms. Korean researchers administered daily either sweet potato starch (group A, placebo), pumpkin seed oil (group B), saw palmetto oil (group C), or pumpkin seed oil plus saw palmetto oil (group D) to 47 men with BPH for 12 months. International prostate symptom score, quality of life, serum prostate specific antigen, and prostate volume measurements were obtained from the participants. The researchers found that international prostate symptom scores were improved in groups B, C and D. Furthermore, maximal urinary flows were improved in groups B and C, with the most significant improvement after six months in group B and after 12 months in group C. A 2009 study result by Hong et al titled: Effects of pumpkin seed oil and saw palmetto oil in Korean men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia published in the journal Nutrition Res Pract results, revealed that administrations of pumpkin seed oil and saw palmetto oil are clinically safe and may be effective as complementary and alternative medicine treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia. African Black Pepper The innovator and formulator of Men's Formula knowing the importance of zinc to the prostate added the African black pepper also known as 'Hwenteaa' as the Akans called it in Ghana to increase the bioavailability of zinc. Researchers have confirmed the anti-proliferative effects of ethanolic extract of African pepper (Xylopia aethiopica) fruits on breast and prostate cancer cells. This can be seen from the inhibition of cell growth by this extract thus highlighting its potential as a therapy against breast and prostate cancer. The study published in July 15, 2016 edition of the journal Experimental and Molecular Therapeutics and Cancer Research is titled \"Preliminary anti-proliferative effect of ethanolic extracts of Xylopia aethiopica on prostate and breast cancer cell lines.\" The researchers, Emeka E.J Iweala and Eunice W. Bankole, also published the abstract of the study in Proceedings of American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) 107th Annual Meeting 2016; April 16 to 20, 2016; New Orleans, Los Angeles, United States. Also a recent study by Adaramoye et al 2017 published in the Journal Basic Clinical Physiology Pharmacology titled: 'Antioxidant and antiproliferative potentials of methanol extract of Xylopia aethiopica. The research also revealed antiproliferative activity in Prostate cancer (pca) cells through a mechanism that involves apoptosis. Therefore, Xylopia aethiopica as a potential therapeutic agent for Prostate cancer. Neem-Azadirachta indica According to research a compound derived from the leaves of the neem plant could significantly suppress the development of prostate cancer. The study found that oral administration of nimbolide, compound extracted from the neem tree could suppress cell invasion and migration of prostate cancer cells without any significant adverse effects. Over a period of 12 weeks, tumor size was reduced by up to 70 percent and its metastasis, or spread, by up to 50 percent. A 2014 study by Hao et al titled: 'Neem components as potential agents for cancer prevention and treatment published in the journal Biochim Biophys Acta revealed that Azadirachtin and nimbolide are among the few bioactive components in neem that have been studied extensively. A 2011 study also by Mahapatra et al titled Novel molecular targets of Azadirachta indica associated with inhibition of tumor growth in prostate cancer and published in the journal AAPS also revealed potent anticancer property and the regulation of multiple cellular pathways could exert pleiotrophic effects in prevention and treatment of prostate cancer. Neem leaf has a certain type of protein that boosts the immune system and assists in killing colon cancer cells. Neem also produces antibodies. In 2006, researchers reported that: An ethanolic extract of neem has been shown to cause cell death of prostate cancer cells ... by inducing apoptosis as evidenced by a dose-dependent increase in DNA fragmentation and a decrease in cell viability ... So the neem extract could be potentially effective against prostate cancer ... \" Carica Papaya One study found that the combination of green tea and lycopene had an effect in the prevention of prostate cancer. Papaya is rich in lycopene. Lycopene is a natural chemical found in tomatoes and several other foods such carica papaya, watermelon and grapefruit. It is a pigment that gives these foods their red color and is a member of a class of compounds called carotenoids. Lycopene is a powerful antioxidant that helps combat damaging free radicals in your body. Levels of lycopene are significantly reduced by advancing age just as prostate cancer increases with age. A 2017 study by Pandey et al published in the journal Biomed Pharmacotherapy titled: Selective anti-proliferative activities of Carica papaya leaf juice extracts against prostate cancer revealed anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic attributes extract against prostatic diseases, including PCa. Another study conducted by University of Florida researchers Dr. Nam Dang and colleagues in Japan has documented papaya's powerful anticancer properties and impact against numerous lab-grown tumors - and without the negative consequences of chemotherapy. The researchers used papaya leaf extract for the study conduction, with the anticancer effects being even stronger with a larger dose of the extract. In addition, the research showed for the first time that papaya leaf extract boosts production of Th1-type cytokines, which are key signaling molecules and very important in the regulation of the immune system. Graviola The active ingredient in Soursop that is proving to be effective is called Annona muricata or Graviola. Graviola is not just a has also displayed anti-parasitic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antirheumatic and cytotoxic properties, according to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. In some cases, Graviola has also been used as a pain killer and the results were positive. In an assessment of Graviola, published in the December 2008 issue of the \"Journal of Dietary Supplements\" by U.S. researchers Lana Dvorkin-Camiel and Julia S. Whelan, multiple in-vitro studies determined that Graviola is effective against various microbial and parasitic agents. Graviola as against the Herpes simplex virus. As it relates directly to cancer, test-tube and animal research demonstrates that Graviola may be an anti-cancer agent. According to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Graviola extract proved to be effective against liver cancer and breast cancer cells. Naturopath Leslie Taylor, author of \"The Healing Power of Rainforest Herbs,\" notes that studies show Graviola has an inhibitory effect on enzyme processes in some cancer cell membranes. Graviola only affected cancer cell membranes and not those of healthy cells. This research may lend support to the herb's traditional use against cancer. Research done over 20 laboratory tests by one of America's largest drug manufacturers suggests that the extracts were able to demonstrate the following: Effectively target and kill malignant cells in 12 types of cancer, including colon, breast, prostate, lung and pancreatic cancer. The tree compounds proved to be up to 10,000 times stronger in slowing the growth of cancer cells than Adriamycin, a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug. What's more, unlike chemotherapy, the compound extracted from the Graviola tree selectively hunts down and kills only cancer cells. It does not harm healthy cells. Stinging Nettle Stinging nettle root (Urtica dioica) is an herb with a long history of medicinal use, especially in Europe. For centuries, men with urinary tract problems have turned to this plant with an ominous name to relieve pelvic pain, urinary pain, burning, and other urinary symptoms. Stinging nettle soothes the urinary tract and also helps men with prostate problems. In addition to its anti-inflammatory properties, stinging nettle is a diuretic, and both of these characteristics make it a good candidate for prostate issues, including prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which share some of the same urinary tract symptoms. According to the Prostate. Net. Com, Stinging nettle is a Tier 2 supplement for prostatitis, meaning that there are significant clinical studies and research for using stinging nettle for prostatitis and similar prostate conditions. Research shows that this herb can help both men with chronic bacterial prostatitis and men with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). It seems that when stinging nettle (along with other supplements) is combined with antibiotics to treat chronic bacterial prostatitis that the elimination of symptoms and long-term outcome is better than taking just an antibiotic alone. Some studies that involve using stinging nettle (and other supplements) for bacterial and nonbacterial types of prostatitis include the following: Researchers conducted a prospective, randomized study on men with chronic bacterial prostatitis to determine the therapeutic effect of saw palmetto, stinging nettle, quercetin, and curcumin extracts compared with the antibiotic prulifloxacin. A total of 143 men were split into two groups: Group A (106 men) received both prulifloxacin (600 mg daily) plus the herbal ingredients for 14 days; Group B (37 men) received only the antibiotic. After one month, 89.6% of men who received the herbal formulas had no symptoms of prostatitis compared with only 27%of the men in the antibiotic-only group. Six months after the intervention portion of the study ended no patients in Group A had recurrent of prostatitis compared with two patients in Group B. The authors concluded that the association of saw palmetto, stinging nettle, quercetin, and curcumin extracts can improve the clinical efficacy of prulifloxacin in men who have chronic bacterial prostatitis (Cai 2009). In a six-month trial including 620 patients, 81% of patients who took stinging nettle reported improved lower urinary tract symptoms compared with only 16% of men who took a placebo (Safarinejad 2005). It is also useful to look at studies that involve using stinging nettle for BPH because sometimes prostatitis patients also experience lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and may take the same medications as BPH patients. Laboratory studies have shown that stinging nettle is comparable to Proscar (finasteride), a drug commonly used to treat BPH, in inhibiting the growth of certain prostate cells. Scientists theorize that stinging nettle contains chemicals that have an impact on the hormones testosterone and estrogen, while another theory suggests the plant's components work directly on prostate cells. In a clinical trial, 257 patients were randomized to receive a combination of 160 mg daily of saw palmetto plus 120 mg of stinging nettle twice a day or placebo. The double-blind segment of the study was followed by an open control period of 24 weeks during which all patients were administered the natural ingredients. The tolerability of the natural supplements was comparable to the placebo, and the authors concluded that the natural formula was clearly superior to the placebo for the amelioration of LUTS as measured by the International Prostate Symptom Score. (Lopatkin 2007). In another study, a subgroup of 431 patients with early stage BPH was evaluated from a randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial that involved 543 patients. The men were randomly given a fixed herbal combination of saw palmetto extract and stinging nettle root or the 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor Proscar (finasteride). After 24 weeks, the mean maximum urinary flow rate increased by 1.9 ml/second in men who took the natural supplements and by 2.4 ml/second in the Proscar group. Men in both groups showed similar improvements in prostate size and in their values on the International Prostate Symptom Score. A safety analysis of 516 patients showed that more men in the Proscar group reported adverse effects than did those in the natural supplement group. The authors concluded that the efficacy of the natural supplement formula and Proscar was similar and unrelated to prostate volume, but that patients tolerated the natural supplement formula better compared to Proscar (Sokeland 2000). Researchers in a European study asked 134 patients to take capsules containing extracts of stinging nettle and another prostate supplement called pygeum. After 28 days, symptoms of urine flow, residual urine, and nighttime urination were significantly reduced. Both pygeum and stinging nettle contain large amounts of beta-sitosterol, another The root of Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides (Linn.) Waterman, commonly used as a chewing stick in southwestern Nigeria, has been reported to have antibacterial activities. This study was carried out to assess the antibacterial activities of the root extracts of the plant and their toothpaste formulations on oral bacterial isolates and type strains. Ethanolic and aqueous extracts of the root bark, wood cellulose and whole root and their tooth paste formulations were evaluated by agar diffusion-cup plate method against type strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Clinical isolates obtained from oral specimens of dental patients and identified by conventional methods were also used. Root extracts were dispersed in a variety of bases for toothpaste formulations. Ethanolic extract of whole root and its toothpaste exhibited the highest antibacterial activities comparable at 2.5%w/w but considerably higher at 5.0%w/w to those of commercially available tooth pastes used as positive control. The root extracts exhibited higher activities against oral bacterial isolates than the type strains. All the test agents showed no activity against P. aeruginosa. The findings indicated that development and use of Z. zanthoxyloides root as a toothpaste will serve to improve oral health. The antibacterial property of this plant will help fight prostate infection. Epilobium- Small Willow Herb Willow herb has a substance called oenothein B, which appears to have 5-alpha-reductase inhibitory activity. A 2003 study, which covered various species of willowherb, proved that the polyphenols from willowherb reduce the spreading of prostate cells thus helping with benign hyperplasia of the prostate. A 2013 study, which included the species Epilobium angustifolium, Epilobium parviflorum and Epilobium hirsutum, found that these species contain potent compounds which stop the growth of prostate cancer cells. The study concluded that willowherb is a strong natural remedy for prostate diseases. Willowherb causes no side effects, unlike conventional drugs like tamsulosin and finasteride, which may cause irregular heartbeat, digestive problems, headache and chronic fatigue. All willow herb species contain flavorglycosides, especially derivatives of kaempferol, quercetin, and sitosterol, and sitosterol glucoside have been detected. These are the compounds considered to be the active ingredients of Saw Palmetto, another major herb used for treating the prostate. Gallic-acid derivatives are also present. Gallic acid and ellagitannins are considered to be the actives associated with the drinking of green tea. Two of these macrocyclic ellagitannins, oenothein A and oenothein B, have been identified as the main constituents responsible for the inhibition of 5-alpha-reductase and aromatese enzymes. These enzymes are considered to play key roles in the cancer of the prostate. This explains the antihyperandrogenic effects that may be useful in the prevention and treatment of BPH, as well it supports the use of the extract in the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer. Preliminary (in vitro) studies at the Prostate Center of Vancouver found that very low concentrations of an extract from small-flowered willow herb tea, in the micrograms per ml level, was among the most active ever seen against abnormal cells and growths of the prostate. Several extracts from Epilobium parviflorum, were evaluated in biochemical assays with 5-alpha-reductase and aromatase, two enzymes prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Serenoa repens- Saw Palmetto The most important factor about saw palmetto is that it's been shown to slow the production of the enzyme 5-alpha reductase, so taking it is a strong step to improve prostate health. This enzyme converts the male hormone testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) \u2014 a sex steroid and androgen hormone. While DHT is important because it plays a role in male development, it also contributes to many common health issues in men, such as loss of libido, an enlarged prostate and hair loss. By taking saw palmetto supplements or using the extract of this beneficial plant, you inhibit the production of this hormone and avoid these issues that are seen in middle-aged and older males. Saw palmetto works by stopping the breakdown of testosterone into its byproduct, called dihydrotestosterone. This helps the body hold onto more of its testosterone and create less dihydrotestosterone. This can slow or stop the growth of the prostate gland. Serenoa repens (Permixon, saw palmetto) inhibits the 5alpha-reductase activity of human prostate cancer cell lines without interfering with PSA expression. Int J Cancer. 2005. Prostate Research Group, University of Edinburgh, School of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK results demonstrate that despite serenoa repens effective inhibition of 5alpha-reductase activity in the prostate, it did not suppress PSA secretion. They confirm the therapeutic advantage of serenoa repens over other 5alpha-reductase inhibitors as treatment with the phytotherapeutic agent will permit the continuous use of PSA measurements as a useful biomarker for prostate cancer screening and for evaluating tumour progression. One 2012 study conducted in Switzerland analyzed 82 patients in an eight-week trial; the patients took one capsule of 320 milligrams saw palmetto extract daily. At the end of the treatment, the International Prostate Symptom Score was reduced from 14.4 \u00b1 4.7 to 6.9 \u00b1 5.2. Investigators' and patients' assessments confirmed the good efficacy, and treatment was very well-tolerated and accepted by the patients. Reduces Risk of Prostate Cancer A systematic literature review of 11 studies identified saw palmetto supplements as one of the five commonly used forms of alternative medicine by men with prostate cancer. Saw palmetto supplements work as 5-alpha reductase inhibitors \u2014 meaning they slow down the conversion of testosterone to DHT by blocking the enzyme and preventing its formation. According to research, DHT is responsible for prostate enlargement, which may be a cause of prostate cancer. The science is still unclear on this matter, but studies on two 5-alpha reductase inhibitor prescriptions, Finasteride (Proscar) and Dutasteride (Avodart) found that men taking either drug were less likely to develop prostate cancer after several years than men getting an inactive placebo. The problem lies in the side effects of these medications \u2014 they can cause sexual side effects, such as lowered sexual desire and impotence. Saw palmetto, on the other hand, can also inhibit DHT and help with urinary problems from BPH, such as trouble urinating and leaking urine, plus it regulates your testosterone levels, helps with libido and works as a natural remedy for impotence. Studies have also found that saw palmetto inhibits the growth of prostatic cancer cells and may destroy dangerous cells. A study conducted at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in Beijing found that saw palmetto induced growth arrest of prostate cancer LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 cells and down-regulated DHT, the hormone that leads to prostate enlargement. Another interesting note about saw palmetto is the research that has been done to measure its effect on post-surgery recovery time. Prostate surgery (known as transurethral resection of the prostate or TURP) can require a lengthy recovery period, but research shows that taking 320 milligrams of saw palmetto daily for two months before prostate surgery can reduce the time spent in surgery. It also helps with blood loss, the development of problems during surgery and the total time spent in the hospital. cyperus esculentus -Tiger Nut Virility Also called 'Atadwe' in Ghana, The product is also well formulated as prostate problems have immersed influence on Men's Sexual Health. In a man the quality of having strength, energy, and a strong sex drive; manliness, 'great importance is placed on a man's virility'. Tiger Nut is a powerful aphrodisiac (sexual stimulant) and recent study revealed that the oil in tiger nut has properties similar to Olive Oil. The tiger nut milk contains higher magnesium, iron, and carbohydrates than cow milk. It has no lactose hence good for individuals who are lactose intolerant. The fatty acid composition is similar to that of olive oil. The oleic acid (fatty acid) content helps with lowering of natural fats and oils and cholesterol making it essential for heart health. It also reduces the risk of colon cancer and helps with constipation and flatulence too. Tiger nuts have many added benefits to the human health. The milk supplies the body with enough quantity of Vitamin E, essential for fertility in both men and women. During a study, two sets of sexually active male rats, highly active and moderately active, were identified depending on baseline sexual activity. Rats in each set were randomly divided into a control and treated groups. The highly active rats were treated with doses of 1 and 2 g/kg/d of raw tiger nut powder, while moderately active rats were treated with a dose of 2 g/kg/d. After 30 days' treatment, sexual behavior and serum hormonal levels were measured. Tiger nut was found to enhance sexual motivation (desire) in highly active and moderately active male rats, and to improve the sexual performance (potency) in moderately active rats. This was accompanied by an upsurge in total serum testosterone concentration in treated rats in both categories. It also boost sperm count as it contain foods high in vitamin C, E, A, as well as folic acid and zinc. The deal is Vitamin C and E will keep your sperms from being damaged while Vitamin A will also increase your sperm motility. Folic acid and zinc will help thicken your sperms. Alstonia Boonei-Nyame Dua Low testosterone levels are associated with low libido in both men and women. This plant can boost libido by increasing the body's levels of testosterone. In men, sperm production is guided by testosterone. Too little testosterone results in low sperm count. Similarly, testosterone plays a role in women's production of eggs, with too little testosterone reducing egg production. In this way, this plant can increase both male and female fertility by increasing the body's testosterone level. A study conducted by Raji et al titled: Reproductive Functions in Male Rats Treated with Methanolic Extract of Alstonia Boonei Stem Bark and published in African Journal of Biomedical Research investigated the effects of methanolic extract of Alstonia boonei stem bark on sperm characteristics, fertility, body and organ weights of adult albino rats. The result revealed that rats treated for 12 weeks had normal sperm motility, viability and counts. In addition, they had normal serum testosterone concentration and fertility. Fertility was zero in rats that were treated for 2 weeks. Visible lesions in the seminiferous tubular cytoarchitecture were observed in the histological sections of the testes from the treated rats prepared at the end of the study period. Normal sperm characteristics were however, restored in rats that were allowed 4 weeks recovery period. The results therefore suggest that the extract could have reversible antifertility effects in male rats.
