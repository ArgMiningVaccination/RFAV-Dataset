IMPROVING YOUR HEALTH, ONE DAY AT A TIME! What is Balanced Health and Nutritional Balancing? Nutritional balancing is a way of life for life. The primary goal is to supply one's body with what it needs through diet, supplements, and purification methods to work effectively and heal itself. When the body is out of balance, or imbalanced, the cause can be for a variety of reasons. Imbalance can be caused by an unhealthy diet, high-stress levels, lifestyle risk factors, exposure to environmental toxic metals, radiation exposure, medication, and other environmental factors. Genetics may also predispose one to certain mineral imbalances, especially if the same issues are inherited from parents. [Epigenetics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8594690/#:~:text=Diet%20%5B2%5D%2C%20toxicants%20%5B,the%20epigenetic%20profile%20%5B6%5D.), an area of scientific research, shows how one's environment can influence one's genes. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT epigenetics play an important role in the science of nutritional balancing by improving the body's biochemical environment. Our epigenetic markers are not set in stone and can be rewritten! Tired of Being Tired?
