Thereafter he served the University for forty-two years under Presidents Hibben, Dodds, and Goheen as director of student employment, director of public information, secretary of the Graduate Council, assistant to the president, and, from 1936 until his retirement in 1966, as Secretary of the University. TO THE MEMORY OF MARY LANCASTER LEITCH 1912-1972 ALEXANDER LEITCH, JR. 1943-1970 MATRI FILIOQUE IN AMORE DEDICATUS PREFACE This book is the work of many hands. Besides my own, there were, to begin with, those of W. Beaumont Whitney, II, who persuaded the Class of 1919, of which he was then president, to com\u00ad mit funds that might otherwise have been used for a fiftieth reunion class book to the support of a badly needed Princeton history. Then there were those of my successor as Secretary of the University, Jeremiah S. Finch, who suggested to the Class of 1919 that I might make creditable use of their funds in my retirement years. Next were added, indispensably, those of Herbert S. Bailey, Jr., Publisher to the University, who endorsed the kind of book I proposed for publication by the University Press. The foregoing trium\u00ad virate has for over a decade conspired to devise every conceivable means to help get the job done, never publicly admitting the possibility that the author might be finished before the manu\u00ad script. Beau Whitney has on a mo\u00ad ment's notice come up to Princeton from Philadelphia whenever he was asked, urging the project on with soft- spoken persistence. Jerry Finch, a mas\u00ad ter of clear and concise statement and widely knowledgeable about all aspects of Princeton, proved a valued consult\u00ad ant on style and content from beginning to end. Herb Bailey cheered the proj\u00ad ect on its way, kept matters within manageable limits, and toward the end was instrumental in finding other hands to help speed it to completion. The kind of book projected was the work of another triumvirate: my wife, my son Sandy, and me. Sandy, a mem\u00ad ber of the Princeton Class of 1965, then a graduate student at Harvard, advised against my undertaking a conventional history for which I lacked proper cre\u00ad dentials. Accordingly, we three, in fre\u00ad quent meetings in our living room, worked out the idea for a book of arti\u00ad cles in alphabetical order about every facet of Princeton life and history from 1746 to the present that would be a use\u00ad ful work of reference and also one to browse in; and we called it A Princeton Companion. Until their deaths, they both contributed immeasurably to the preparation of articles that set the mode for what was to follow. I have dedicated this book to their memory. The Latin inscription I have used is taken from the Rothschild Arch (q.v.), which links the University Chapel and Dickinson Hall. Still another pair of strong hands took up work on the Companion when my old friend, Nelson P. Rose '31, in town for the graduation of his second Princeton son, asked whether I didn't need research and editorial assistance and then gave his own affirmative an\u00ad swer with a spontaneous and very generous gift for that purpose, an example later followed by other emi\u00ad nent Princetonians. He helped in other ways, too. Carefully reading all the many articles I sent him for criticism, he helped clean up grammar and tighten syntax, quoted passages from Lincoln's second inaugural as examples of alternatives to over-long sentences, supplied pithy anecdotes from a richly stored memory of his own undergradu\u00ad ate days, and always found something to commend. Presidents Goheen and Bowen helped with funds at their disposal and gave their enthusiastic encouragement, as did Emeritus President Dodds. Midway in the writing, financial sup-VlIl PREFACE port of the Companion, received a much needed stimulus at the hands of another old friend of Princeton's and of mine, Grant (\"Bill\") Oliver '25. His cheerful persuasion brought substantial gifts from himself, Brooks Emeny '24, Dorothy Hubbell ['24], Lewis Mack T. Beck M. Walker '32, and Rawleigh Warner, Jr. '44. A few years later, when a further transfusion appeared necessary, Bill teamed with Beau Whitney to secure generous gifts from themselves, William A. Kirkland 19, Ernest C. Savage 19, Benjamin Strong '19, Harold H. Helm '20, James F. Oates, Jr. '21, Brooks Emeny '24, Henry H. Connor '25, and Horace H. Wilson '25. All of these Princetonians, along with the Class of 1919, merit the applause of all who find the Companion to their liking. At about the same time, at the sug\u00ad gestion of Herb Bailey and Jerry Finch, an effort was begun to obtain the help of faculty and alumni in writing certain articles. Ultimately some seventy per\u00ad sons responded; their names will be found at the end of the articles they contributed. These contributions, which represent about a fifth of the con\u00ad tents, helped bring the book to earlier completion; in not a few cases they gave it added scholarly authority and literary quality. Various faculty and alumni helped to enlist authors or to read and make sug\u00ad gestions about completed articles, among them\u2014in addition to Bailey, Finch, Whitney, and Oliver\u2014Carlos Baker, Morroe Berger, David P. BiI- lington, Joseph L. Bolster, Jr., John Tyler Bonner, Julian P. Boyd, J. Doug\u00ad las Brown, W. Frank Craven, Frederic E. Fox, Donald W. Griffin, Robert C. Gunning, David W. Hirst, Ernest F. Johnson, Frances F. Jones, Sheldon Judson, Richard A. Lester, Arthur S. Link, Dorothy Lupichuk, Henry D. Smyth, Lyman Spitzer, Jr., Joseph R. Strayer, Willard Thorp, Leslie L. Viv\u00ad ian, Jr., and Thomas H. Wright, Jr., and my two old Princeton friends, Alan W. Carrick '23 and Frederick S. Os\u00ad borne '24. As a member of the sponsoring Class of 1919, Doug Brown took a particular interest in the project. Besides writing four articles himself, the Emeritus Pro\u00ad vost and Dean of the Faculty drew on his long experience with the faculty to suggest those I might ask to write arti\u00ad cles and enlisted some recruits himself over lunch at Prospect. Emeritus Davis Professor of Ameri\u00ad can History, Frank Craven, another productive writer and good recruiting agent, was an especially generous ad\u00ad viser and consultant. His door was al\u00ad ways open and I went through it fre\u00ad quently to have my history checked and to be cheered by his good-humored counsel. Carlos Baker showed me how to sharpen the focus of a story along with other tricks he had learned in his long writing career. On receiving a limp an\u00ad swer to his question about the Compan\u00ad ion's progress when he encountered me dragging my way up Nassau Street one blustery March day, the Woodrow Wil\u00ad son Professor of Literature volunteered to take on another long piece\u2014he had already done two\u2014and arranged for two more excellent ones by a younger colleague. Grateful acknowledgment is also due various other kinds of assistance. Useful suggestions about athletic arti\u00ad cles were made by Asa S. Bushnell Jr. Samuel C. Howell '50, Gordon G. Sikes '16, Donald C. PREFACE IX Stuart, Jr. '35, Daniel F. Sullivan, and Sanford G. Thatcher '65. Indispensable archival aid was provided successively by M. Halsey Thomas, F. James DaI- lett, Constance K. Escher, Edith James, and Earle E. Coleman. An old New Hampshire hill-walking compan\u00ad ion and former Washington Post editor, Kenneth Dole (Harvard '24) gave a helpful perspective on a variety of arti\u00ad cles. I thank my daughter Margie and my son Colin for many helpful suggestions and for their enduring warm support. With the help of the gifts previously mentioned, the Companion benefited by a succession of talented research and editorial assistants: Margaret Rindfuss, Elizabeth Reilly '73, Phyllis Benjamin '76, Elizabeth Billington '76, Leslie Mitchner, and Stuart Mitchner. Be\u00ad cause their tenures were longest and fullest, three of them merit special mention. A member of the first co\u00ad educational class, Liz Reilly was able to supplement her conscientious and ef\u00ad fective work with helpful contemporary insights gained during her pioneering four-year passage through Princeton. A faculty daughter who served the Com\u00ad panion longest, Elizabeth Billington's clear-headed and disciplined approach to any problem presented to her and her fine sense of what is appropriate made her an indispensable ally in every phase of our work. Stuart Mitchner, an author with strong academic qualifica\u00ad tions, brought to our project an experi\u00ad ence in research and a skill with words that made his contribution invaluable. In the closing stages we were fortu\u00ad nate to be under the capable guidance of Gail Filion, staff editor at the Uni\u00ad versity Press. Her experience, imper\u00ad turbability, and good nature did much to ease the way in bringing our en\u00ad deavor to a successful conclusion. * * * Those who have contributed their means, their talents, and their time can take satisfaction from knowing that they have helped produce a volume that provides in readily usable form detailed information about the diverse elements of Princeton's heritage and its ongoing life. Included among some 400 articles are the following: Biographical sketches of 125 eminent Princetonians\u2014all its presidents, some deans, half a hundred other professors, and a number of trustees and other alumni. (Except in the case of the pres\u00ad idents, the Companion follows the practice of other publications\u2014e.g., the Dictionary of American Biography and the Dictionary of Scientific Biography\u2014and does not include a sketch of any person living at the time the manuscript was prepared.) Historical articles about Princeton's trustees, its charter, its seal, and its en\u00ad dowment. A description of the organization and development of the Faculty, and his\u00ad tories of all the University's depart\u00ad ments of instruction and research, and many of its special programs.

In a book of this kind, errors of both commission and omission are bound to occur, and I will appreciate being in\u00ad formed, through Princeton University Press, of any the reader may find. An extended coverage of Princeton's Alexander Leitch A PRINCETON COMPANION ADMISSION 3 Admission to Princeton in the early years was based entirely on a knowl\u00ad edge of Latin and Greek, but by 1760 entering freshmen were required also to understand the principal rules of \"vulgar arithmetic.\" The president of the College personally examined each applicant and determined whether or not he should be admitted. Early one morning in the 1790s, Titus Hutchin\u00ad son, who had come down from Ver\u00ad mont, called at Tusculum to apply for admission, and after morning prayers and breakfast with President Wither- spoon, was grilled by him in Latin and Greek and admitted, with the under\u00ad standing that he was to occupy the com\u00ad ing vacation with the studies in which he was behind. (Hutchinson graduated with honors in 1794 and later became chief justice of Vermont.) Population was thinner then, and so was the proportion seeking a college education. Writing to a trustee in 1803, Chemistry Professor John Maclean, Sr., ended his letter: \"We got another student today.\" Thirty years later his son, Vice-president John Maclean, Jr., received a visit from James Moffat, a twenty-two-year-old immigrant printer from Scotland sent to see him by a mutual friend, and after an hour's con\u00ad versation about Latin and Greek, in\u00ad formed the young man, who had been unaware of what was transpiring, that he had been admitted to the junior class. (Moffat gave the valedictory at graduation in 1835 and was later profes\u00ad sor of classics in the College and the father of five Princeton-educated sons.) Oral entrance examinations con\u00ad tinued until well past the middle of the nineteenth century, when they began to be superseded by written examina\u00ad tions, first given only in Princeton, and after 1888 also at strategic points across the country. With the founding of the College Entrance Examination Board in 1900, Princeton honored the board's examinations as well as its own, and after 1915 required them of all appli\u00ad cants. The great increase in the number of applicants for admission to American colleges following the First World War led the trustees in 1922 to adopt a pol\u00ad icy of limited enrollment and selective admission in order to preserve the es\u00ad sential features of Princeton's residen\u00ad tial life and to maintain its standards of individual instruction. At the same time they created the office of director of admission, subsequently occupied by Radcliffe Heermance, 1922-1950; C. '61, 1978- twenty-eight years as first admission director, Radcliffe Heer\u00ad mance pioneered in the development of selective admission procedures, es\u00ad tablished close relationships with sec\u00ad ondary schools in all parts of the coun\u00ad try, and helped guide and develop the College Entrance Examination Board, of which he was chairman from 1933 to 1936. Another pioneer during the formative years of selective admission was Psychology Professor Carl C. Brigham, who did innovative work in aptitude testing and was later chiefly responsible for the development of the College Board's Scholastic Apti\u00ad tude Test, first given in 1926. In the 1930s Princeton adopted a special plan of admission without examination for students of exceptional achievement and promise in the Far West and South, where school pro\u00ad grams did not fit them specifically for College Board examinations. Thanks to this program and the missionary efforts 4 ADMISSION of nation-wide Alumni Schools Com\u00ad mittees, the geographical distribution of members of freshman classes was substantially broadened. This temporary Princeton solution anticipated a more general and perma\u00ad nent one which came in 1940 when the College Board replaced examinations based on a set curriculum with objec\u00ad tive tests that endeavored to cover the common elements of what was taught in schools throughout the country. This change brought marked increases both in the number of applicants for admis\u00ad sion to Princeton and the number of schools from which they came. A significant development, more re\u00ad cently, concerned blacks and other minority groups. Although a few blacks studied privately with President With- erspoon as early as 1774, and although, beginning in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, black students oc\u00ad casionally earned University degrees, the first appreciable influx did not begin until the 1960s when the Univer\u00ad sity adopted an active recruitment pol\u00ad icy for minority students. By 1976, the freshman class of 1980 included ninety-two black students and eighty- nine members of other minority groups \u2014Puerto Ricans, Mexican Americans, native Americans, and Asian Ameri\u00ad cans. The admission process was further broadened in 1969 when Princeton began undergraduate coeducation, with separate admission quotas for men and women. That year, 171 women matriculated, 69 as transferring sopho\u00ad mores, juniors, or seniors, 102 as members, along with 819 men, of the freshman class of 1973. The trustees adopted a policy of equal access for men and women in 1974 and at the same time determined that the under\u00ad graduate body should remain at approx\u00adimately its existing size for the forsee- able future. In 1976, the freshman class of 1980 numbered 736 men and 380 women, drawn from a record number of applicants\u201410,305. In meeting the responsibilities in\u00ad volved in a necessarily comprehensive and painstaking process of selection, the admission director and his staff rely on help from alumni and un\u00ad dergraduates. More than 130 Alumni Schools Committees across the country act as liaison between the University and secondary school students in their communities, helping the applicants get a clearer picture of what Princeton can offer them and making certain that the Admission Office has a full knowl\u00ad edge of each candidate's capabilities. On campus, an Undergraduate Schools Committee helps prospective students obtain a first-hand acquaintance with Princeton by arranging meals, over\u00ad night accommodations in dormitories, attendance at classes and lectures, and meetings with faculty. In 1976 the University's admission objectives were summed up by Admis\u00ad sion Director Callard in these words: Princeton seeks to enroll a student body that will be characterized by both excellence and diversity. While the University is interested in many kinds of excellence, superior past academic performance and signifi\u00ad cant promise for future academic growth must clearly be the funda\u00ad mental considerations in evaluating candidates. But Princeton is no less interested in the personal credentials of its ap\u00ad plicants and is particularly concerned to find evidence of such qualities of personal character as honesty and trustworthiness, which are so crucial to the health of a residential uni-AEROSPACE AND MECHANICAL SCIENCES 5 versity community like Princeton's. Beyond personal integrity, the Uni\u00ad versity is continually looking for evi\u00ad dence of such important qualities as curiosity, initiative, energy, imagina\u00ad tion, sensitivity, concern for others, commitment, persistence, creativity, leadership, and a sense of responsi\u00ad bility\u2014qualities which clearly relate to academic as well as nonacademic aspects of an applicant's potential performance at Princeton, yet which are sometimes more easily perceived in the record of an applicant's nonacademic pursuits. The director of admission and his staff are responsible only for under\u00ad graduate admissions. Graduate admis\u00ad sions are made by the dean of the Graduate School after reviewing the recommendations of the departments concerned. Advisory Councils for the academic de\u00ad partments were established in 1941. Each council consists of from three to fifteen members appointed by the trus\u00ad tees for three-year terms; nominations are made by the departments in consul\u00ad tation with the Alumni Council. Mem\u00ad bership is not restricted to alumni, but at least one member of each council must be an alumnus. Meetings for con\u00ad sultation and conference are held at such times as are mutually agreed upon by the advisory council and the de\u00ad partment concerned. Close to 500 per\u00ad sons serve on some forty advisory coun\u00ad cils. Aerospace and Mechanical Sciences, The Department of, which was formed in 1963 by a merger of the departments of Mechanical and Aeronautical En\u00ad gineering, traces its roots back to the early 1920s when Arthur M. Greene, Jr. (q.v.), came to Princeton to estab\u00ad lish a Department of Mechanical En\u00ad gineering and to serve as dean of the newly created School of Engineering (q.v.). Classes were held in the old School of Science, with a makeshift laboratory in a boiler house across Washington Road, until the John C. Green En\u00ad gineering Building was constructed in 1928. Starting with only two young assistants in mechanical engineering, Dean Greene taught over half the courses in the department in addition to performing his administrative duties. Louis F. Rahm and Alfred E. Sorenson joined the slowly expanding depart\u00ad ment in 1926; Lewis F. Moody as pro\u00ad fessor of fluid mechanics and machine design arrived in 1930. During the Depression, graduating seniors, unable to obtain employment, returned for graduate study, spurring the development of both the engine and hydraulics laboratories. By 1941, when Dean Greene retired and was succeeded as dean and chairman by Kenneth H. Condit, the Department of Mechanical Engineering was both well staffed and equipped, permitting it to acquit itself well during the hectic war years when year-round teaching of mili\u00ad tary and civilian students was the order of the day. In the summer of 1941, when the United States was developing the technological and industrial base that would give it world leadership in the design and manufacture of aircraft, Dean Condit invited Daniel C. Sayre (q.v.) to conduct a three-month study of the \"possibility and desirability\" of in\u00ad troducing courses relating to aeronauti\u00ad cal engineering into the curriculum of the Mechanical Engineering Depart\u00ad ment. Although recognizing the limited na-6 AEROSPACE & MECHANICAL SCIENCES ture of this original intent, the ener\u00ad getic and irrepressible Sayre made such a strong case for the creation of a sep\u00ad arate Department of Aeronautical Engineering that his suggestions were adopted, and in early 1942 he found himself both Princeton's first professor of aeronautical engineering and the new department's entire faculty. With keen competition for available talent in the rapidly expanding aero\u00ad nautical field, building a departmental staff was not easy, but Sayre succeeded in enlisting Alexander A. Nikolsky, who had helped Sikorsky develop the helicopter, and Harry Ashworth, a skilled machinist and instrument ex\u00ad pert.. These three, aided by a few graduate assistants, and equipped with a small wind tunnel on a balcony of what is now Aaron Burr Hall, were the entire department until the end of the war. Then began a steady increase in faculty and a meteoric rise in achieve\u00ad ment that culminated in the depart\u00ad ment's recognition as a leader in the field by the mid-1950s. The first of the new faculty to arrive was Courtland D. Perkins, fresh from Wright Field. Later, between various leaves of absence to serve as chief sci\u00ad entist to the Air Force and as assistant secretary of the air force for research and development, Perkins pioneered in-flight test analysis of aircraft stability and control. His research interests led to the creation of the Flight Dynamics Laboratory, a unique facility for an aca\u00ad demic institution, in which theory is tested in actual flight. Rapidly outgrowing its balcony, the department moved to a series of build\u00ad ings near Lake Carnegie and to installa\u00ad tions behind Palmer Stadium that had housed wartime research in physics. The plan of development aimed at maintaining a strong undergraduate program, but concentrated on graduate training and research. A Master's pro\u00ad gram was begun with the inception of the department in 1942, a doctoral pro\u00ad gram in 1949. Experimental as well as analytical research supported these graduate pro\u00ad grams. The strange constructions with which Nikolsky's students probed the idiosyncrasies of helicopters caused in\u00ad terested comment. The racket of super\u00ad sonic wind tunnels and rocket firings brought outraged protests. It was clear that new quarters were needed. Already contending with the cancer that would take his life five years later, Sayre spearheaded the effort that led to the acquisition in 1951 of the property formerly occupied by the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research and to its development as the James Forrestal Campus (q.v.). The University at last had a place to house research that, in Sayre's words, \"makes loud noises or bad smells,\" and the department moved to these new quarters with alac\u00ad rity. It was here that Charles Conrad, third man to walk the moon, completed his undergraduate studies in 1953. Recognition of the stature the de\u00ad partment had achieved came with Harry F. Guggenheim's selection of Princeton as the site for one of two jet propulsion research centers. (The other was at the California Institute of Technology.) In 1954 Luigi Crocco of the University of Rome was appointed first Goddard Professor of Jet Propul\u00ad sion. His work in combustion theory along with Martin Summerfield's studies of solid propellants had a pro\u00ad found effect upon rocket engine devel\u00ad opment during the next decade. In 1951 Sayre relinquished the chairmanship to Perkins in order to give full time to the direction of the Forrestal Campus. Under Perkins, re\u00ad search activities expanded until there were active programs in the entire AFRO-AMERICAN STUDIES 7 aerospace field, ranging from low speed flight to hypersonic reentry. In 1963, in recognition of overlap\u00ad ping interests, coupled with declining enrollments in mechanical engineer\u00ad ing, the two departments merged to form the Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Sciences under Perkins's leadership. Activities of the new de\u00ad partment reached an all-time high in 1967 with a research budget of almost $3.25 million and with an enrollment of 140 graduate and 125 undergraduate students. The late 1960s and early 1970s were difficult years. With increasing national anguish over war in Vietnam came campus unrest and a wave of revulsion at the ills produced by the misuse of technology. Since the department was deeply involved in a technology closely linked in the public mind with weaponry, it inevitably suffered de\u00ad creasing enrollments and had to face critical investigations to determine the appropriateness of its research on a campus greatly concerned with the needs of humanity. That the research was demonstrated to be of high calibre and in no way un- suited to the University was not suffi\u00ad cient for the departmental faculty. With characteristic vigor they turned their talents toward solutions of societal problems. Research narrowly aimed at aircraft systems broadened its focus to include all modes of transportation. Combustion investigations moved from studies of rocket motors to problems of noise, of air pollution, and even of the dangers of smoking. Gas dynamicists turned to problems of energy conver\u00ad sion and control, while the aerodynami- cists, not to be outdone, started work on high efficiency windmills for power generation. By 1974, as Perkins retired as chair\u00ad man, the changes had had effect. En\u00adrollments were recovering, research budgets were expanding, and the de\u00ad partment, under the new leadership of Seymour M. Bogdonoff, was facing the future with confidence. David C. Hazen Afro-American Studies Program, The, was organized in 1969 to concern itself, the faculty committee said, \"with the history, the culture and the current situation of twenty-five million Ameri\u00ad cans of African origins.\" Earlier in the 1960s, interdepartmental interest in this field had been focused in two re\u00ad search conferences on scholarly ap\u00ad proaches to Afro-American Studies held under the auspices of the Straus Council on Human Relations. In the program's first year, twenty-six under\u00ad graduates\u2014half of them white\u2014con\u00ad centrated in Afro-American Studies, and more than 500 took one or more of its elective courses. In the belief that \"the black experi\u00ad ence is a special case of American expe\u00ad rience,\" the program was designed to provide an opportunity for interdisci\u00ad plinary and comparative study \"of the position and experience of people of Af\u00ad rican ancestry in the United States, seen in relation to the experience of black people in other parts of the world.\" The program is supervised by an in\u00ad terdepartmental committee and in\u00ad volves twelve cooperating departments and schools: Anthropology, The School of Architecture and Urban Planning, Art and Archaeology, Economics, Eng\u00ad lish, History, Philosophy, Politics, Psy\u00ad chology, Religion, Sociology, and the Woodrow Wilson School. Students enter the program through one of the cooperating departments or schools. In the program's early years, the University received an $88,300 grant 8 STEPHEN ALEXANDER from the Ford Foundation for the de\u00ad velopment of undergraduate Afro- American studies and a $215,000 grant from the Rockefeller Foundation for the support of graduate studies and faculty research. F. Sheldon Hackney, a specialist in the history of the American South, was chairman of the committee that de\u00ad signed the program. Chairmen of the program have included C. Sylvester Whitaker, Jr. (Politics), John R. Willis (Near Eastern Studies), and since 1973, Howard F. Taylor (Sociology). Alexander, Stephen (1806-1883), under whose influence astronomy first devel\u00ad oped as a separate discipline at Princeton, graduated with honors from Union College at eighteen. A cousin and also a brother-in-law of Joseph Henry (q.v.), he collaborated with Henry in his scientific investigations at Albany Academy and accompanied him to Princeton in 1832, when Henry be\u00ad came professor of natural philosophy. Appointed tutor in mathematics in 1833 and professor of astronomy in 1840, Al\u00ad exander's association with the College continued for fifty years. Alexander gave Princeton's first dis\u00ad crete course in astronomy; he was well liked by his students, who called him \"Stephy.\" The College's first astronomy building, the Halsted Observatory, which stood on University Place from 1869 to 1932, was built through his in\u00ad fluence and from his plans; however, a telescope was not installed until after his retirement. Working with only his own small telescope, he carried on a steady program of research, published many papers, and studied comets, in\u00ad cluding the great comet of 1843, whose sudden appearance excited American interest in astronomy. He also studied the atmospheres of Venus, Mercury, and Jupiter, led expeditions for the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the Na\u00ad tional Academy of Sciences to observe solar eclipses, and in collaboration with Henry, conducted experiments on the relative heat of sunspots. He was presi\u00ad dent of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1859 and was chosen as one of the original fifty members of the National Academy of Sciences in 1862. The winter before he died, Alexan\u00ad der concluded his astronomical obser\u00ad vations of more than half a century by observing the 1882 transit of Venus across the disk of the sun. This phenomenon, not due to occur again until 2004, was well covered from a Princeton point of view, as it was also observed in Princeton by Alexander's immediate successor, Charles A. Young (q.v.), and in Oyster Bay, New York, by a five-year-old boy named Henry Norris Russell (q.v.). Alexander Hall, one of the University's most useful buildings, was erected in 1892 as a convocation hall for com\u00ad mencement exercises and other large gatherings. It was given by Harriet Crocker Alexander in honor of her hus\u00ad band, Charles B. Alexander 1870, his father, Henry M. Alexander 1840, and his grandfather, Archibald Alexander hon. D. D. 1810, all of whom served as Princeton trustees. During its early years the building was used for the sesquicentennial cele\u00ad bration, for Woodrow Wilson's inaugu\u00ad ration as president, and for the Stafford Little Lectures given by ex-President Grover Cleveland. For thirty years freshmen were welcomed and seniors graduated in Alexander, but by 1922 commencement exercises had out\u00ad grown the building and thereafter were held in front of Nassau Hall. After Mar-ALUMNI COLLEGE 9 quand Chapel burned in 1920, Alexan\u00ad der was used for Sunday services until the University Chapel was completed in 1929. Designed by William A. Potter in a Romanesque style, Alexander is rich in ornate detail. Although it cannot be considered a complete success aes\u00ad thetically, the big, round, granite and brownstone building has always seemed able to meet the changing needs of succeeding generations and to accommodate many different activities \u2014student mass meetings, political gatherings, football rallies, concerts, lectures, and speeches. Among those who have spoken from its rostrum have been Andrew Carnegie, William Jen\u00ad nings Bryan, Albert Einstein, Will Ro\u00ad gers, Eleanor Roosevelt, Norman Thomas, Adlai Stevenson, William Douglas, C. P. Snow, Madame Nu, Eugene McCarthy, George Wallace, David E. Lilienthal, and Art Buchwald. Alumni College was founded in 1970 to provide, as the Alumni Council an\u00ad nounced, \"an intensive period of study and dialogue for those whose curiosity and intellectual interest reach beyond their normal daily pursuits.\" It was an outgrowth of the faculty-alumni forums, an earlier Princeton venture in continuing education initiated in 1951 by the Class of 1926 at its twenty-fifth reunion and an increasingly popular part of the June reunion weekend ever since. The first Alumni College met at the Princeton Inn College during the post- reunion week of 1970, and this on- campus meeting became an annual fea\u00ad ture of the Alumni Council's program. Other Alumni Colleges, lasting from two to fourteen days, were gradually organized outside of Princeton, in re\u00ad sponse\u00b7 to alumni demand. Unlike the Faculty-Alumni Forums, which are open to all alumni in attend\u00ad ance at reunions, Alumni Colleges are residential, and enrollment is limited in order to give participants more op\u00ad portunity for interaction with their teachers and each other. The Princeton faculty usually comes from an assort\u00ad ment of disciplines and is sometimes supplemented by authorities in other fields outside the University. A typical program includes lectures, precepts, seminar discussions, films, field trips, and social and recreational activities. \"An open admission policy\" is followed, spouses, children, and friends being welcome as well as alumni. By the mid-seventies five or six Alumni Colleges were meeting each year in the Far West, the Middle West, and at various places along the eastern seaboard from Massachusetts to Florida, exploring topics that ranged in time from the Middle Ages to the last thirty years in American history, and often matching the subject with the set\u00ad ting: \"The Yankee City\" at the Princeton Club of New York; \"At the Edge of Wilderness\" at the Blairstown Education Center near the Appalachian Trail in northwestern New Jersey. At the first Alumni College abroad, conducted at Rouen in the summer of 1976, a student body of thirty-five, rep\u00ad resenting classes from 1925 to 1965, engaged in an eleven-day study of modern France under the guidance of a faculty that included two Princeton pro\u00ad fessors of romance languages, an ar\u00ad chitect and a lawyer (both alumni, prac\u00ad ticing in France), and the United States ambassador to France. \"Alumni who attend Alumni Col\u00ad leges,\" the Alumni Council concluded after six years experience with the pro-10 ALUMNI COUNCIL gram, \"come to study and learn, and they are not often disappointed.\" Alumni Council, The, traces its an\u00ad tecedents to the Committee of Fifty, organized in 1904 to raise funds for \"the immediate necessities and future de\u00ad velopment of the University.\" Chief among the immediate necessities was Woodrow Wilson's newly announced preceptorial system. Aspiring to a broader function, the Committee of Fifty transformed itself in 1909 into the Graduate Council, which after almost fifty years changed its name to Alumni Council. The council has provided leadership for alumni activity through the medium of standing committees on alumni associations, athletics, class af\u00ad fairs and reunions, communications, schools, and undergraduate activities. Among its most significant contribu\u00ad tions have been the institution of advi\u00ad sory councils for the academic divisions of the University, the launching of An\u00ad nual Giving, and the development of the Alumni College. In 1920 the council brought all of the Princeton alumni organizations into a centralized Alumni Association, replac\u00ad ing the Alumni Association of Nassau Hall, which had been founded in 1826 \"to promote the interests of the College and the friendly intercourse of its graduates.\" The Alumni Association, of which every alumnus is ipso facto a member, meets twice a year, as does the Alumni Council, which is, in effect, the association's executive body. The Alumni Council is composed of presidents of alumni classes and re\u00ad gional alumni associations, and also in\u00ad cludes all former chairmen who are life members, and a group of appointed members. The total membership is about 280. Chairmen of the Committee of Fifty, the Graduate Council, and the Alumni Council have been: Cleveland H. Dodge 1879, Parker D. Handy 1879, Charles Scribner 1875, Francis Speir 1877, Walter E. Hope Ol, Francis G. Landon 1881, Ambrose G. Todd 1884, Walter L. Johnson 1897, Lawrence G. Payson '16, Chauncey Belknap 12, Robert M. '13, Harold H. Helm '20, Lewis N. Lukens '17, Richard K. Stevens '22, John C. Williams '25, E. Clark '29, Chandler Cudlipp '19, Dorrance Walker W. Stevenson George C. Denniston '27, William P. Wright, Jr. '33 Grant Sanger '31, T. Henry Dixon '40, D. Bruce Merrifield '42, Mortimer H. Chute, Jr. '56, Frederick L. Redpath George Faunce III '47, and Secretaries have been: George W. Burleigh 1892, Harold Collins 1892, Alexan\u00ad der Leitch '24, Thurston J. Davies 16, Donald W. Griffin '23, Joseph G. Brad- shaw '40, Charles L. Taggart '51, David G. Rahr '60, Daniel N. White '65. In 1961, after a quarter of a century as secretary of the council, Donald Griffin was appointed general secre\u00ad tary, serving until his retirement in 1964. William D. Lippincott '41, pre\u00ad viously dean of students, was executive director from 1968 to 1972. David Rahr has been director since 1972. Alumni Day was first observed on Lin\u00ad coln's birthday in 1915. It was organ\u00ad ized to give alumni a glimpse of campus daily life when the University was in session. About a hundred alumni joined in what the Alumni Weekly called \"an intellectual pilgrimage to their Alma Mater,\" highlighted by a meeting of the Alumni Association in the Faculty Room of Nassau Hall. The following year, Alumni Day took ALUMNI PARADE 11 place on Washington's birthday, the traditional date until 1955, when it began to be observed on the Saturday nearest February 22nd. Gradually, at\u00ad tendance outgrew the Faculty Room, and since the late 1930s, Alumni Asso\u00ad ciation meetings have taken place at formal luncheons (held successively in the old University Gymnasium, Baker Rink, Dillon and Jadwin Gymnasiums), preceded by faculty panel discussions and lectures, and followed, since 1970, by the annual Service of Remem\u00ad brance. The luncheon program, which in\u00ad cludes brief remarks by the president, is the occasion of the annual presenta\u00ad tion of the Woodrow Wilson Award, the James Madison Medal, the Pyne Honor Prize, and the Freshman First Honor Prize. Announcement is also made of nominations for alumni trustees, with reports on the progress of Annual Giv\u00ad ing and of other benefactions to the University. The day's program is rounded out by an undergraduate de\u00ad bate, athletic events, and a reception at the John Maclean House. Alumni Directory, The, first appeared in 1888 with the names and most of the addresses of some four thousand living graduates and former students. It was compiled by two graduates of the Class of 1877, Professor William Libbey, Jr., and Trustee M. Taylor Pyne, who spent several years gathering addresses with the help of class secretaries. Libbey and Pyne also edited the second edition in 1892 and the third in 1896. Thereaf\u00ad ter new editions were issued at three- or four-year intervals, by the Office of the Secretary from 1902 to 1917, by the Alumni Council Office from 1921 to 1948, by the Bureau of Alumni Records beginning in 1952. The twenty-fifth edition, published in 1974, by the Alumni Records Section of Printing, Mailing and Alumni Records, listed the names (and the addresses of all but 1,964) of some 44,000 alumni of the College and the Graduate School and of about 4,900 undergraduate and graduate students then in residence. Alumni Parade, The, held annually on the Saturday before Commencement as the climax of class reunions, originated in the 1890s but, as now conducted, is related to an earlier alumni event: be\u00ad ginning soon after the Civil War, alumni classes had been taking part, on Commencement Day, in an ordered procession to the place of their dinner meeting where \"an excellent and abun\u00ad dant meal\" was followed by five or six alumni speeches, \"both grave and witty, serious and mirthful.\" The more lighthearted Saturday parade grew out of the baseball rivalry between Yale and Princeton. Their teams first met in 1868, and twenty years later began playing one of their several games at Princeton on the Saturday before Commencement. Alumni attendance grew, and now and then a class back for a reunion would march to the game behind a band. In 1897, stimulated by a torchlight proces\u00ad sion of alumni at the Sesquicentennial celebration the previous fall, all the \"reuning\" classes joined in a parade to the game. Thus began the most colorful event of the annual Commencement program. For many years, the P-rade (as it came to be known) formed in front of Nassau Hall, moved across the Campus to '79 Arch, down Prospect Avenue, through the Thompson Gateway, and around University Field, passing in re\u00ad view before the president's box behind first base. At first the sole decoration worn by 12 ALUMNI PARADE returning alumni was a badge with class numerals on it. Gradually classes began to distinguish themselves by using class hats, balloons, parasols, large palm leaf fans, and before long younger classes were wearing colorful costumes, carry\u00ad ing humorous signs, and sometimes performing comic stunts. In 1907, the Class of 1897, dressed as Dutch boys, made an arresting sight\u2014 and sound\u2014as they clattered along in their wooden shoes. A year later, the Class of 1898 marched as a Roman Legion, with tunics, buskins, shields, and swords, wheeling at their head a reproduction of the Arch of Trajan, on which was emblazoned: A-I-N-T-T-H-I-S A-T-R-I-U-M-P-H In 1909, not long after Princeton had been given its lake by the Scottish- American Andrew Carnegie, the Class of 1904 appeared in an orange and black tartan highland dress, led by a bagpipe band of highlanders in bonnet, kilt, and sporran. As the stalwart drum major whirled his baton, the double-jointed drummer pummeled his drum, and the pipers piped their martial airs, the long line of '04 Highlanders presented the appearance of a Scottish regiment on parade, winning the crowd's thunder\u00ad ous applause. In 1910 the Class of 1900 paraded in long gowns as suffragettes, with the former football player \"Big Bill\" Ed\u00ad wards, leading on horseback, as an im\u00ad probable Joan of Arc. In 1916, when interest in the pre\u00ad paredness movement was mounting, the Class of 1906 wore the top hat, chin whiskers, white-starred blue tailcoat, and the red and white striped trousers of Uncle Sam. At the \"Victory Commencement\" of 1919 a throng of alumni, happy to be back from the war, formed the longest and most colorful P-rade up to that time. That year Alumni Day coincided with Flag Day, and at the conclusion of the parade, a band struck up \"The Bat\u00ad tle Hymn of the Republic,\" and five thousand alumni marched across Uni\u00ad versity Field, waving their flags from right to left with each step\u2014\"a moving sight,\" the Alumni Weekly reported, \"which brought the 10,000 spectators to their feet.\" An even longer P-rade took place in 1946 when 7,300 alumni returned to Princeton for a \"Victory Reunion.\" The procession reached a climax on Univer\u00ad sity Field with the massing of service flags showing the number in each class who had served in the war and the number who had given their lives. In general, classes have tended to wear costumes through their fifteenth or twentieth reunions, class blazers and occasionally gay umbrellas with class numerals through their fiftieth, and thereafter, blazers or simply hatbands with class numerals. Over the years, alumni have ap\u00ad peared as Mexican bullfighters, Roman gladiators, convicts, Spanish toreadors, pirates, zouaves, French artists, Apache dancers, Roman emperors, pierrots, cowboys, Anzacs, French sailors, Confederate soldiers, Indians, the French Foreign Legion, African hunters, chefs, firemen, baseball players, spacemen, and even as tigers. Live animals have added excitement from time to time: in 1906 a troupe of trained lions, in 1923 two tigers, in 1949 three elephants who led the clowns of '44 around the field and then knelt in front of the president's box. Bands have always been an indispen\u00ad sable element. Every class celebrating a major reunion (i.e. those occurring at PRINCETON ALUMNI WEEKLY 13 five-year intervals) has usually had one, and occasionally one or two classes celebrating \"off-year\" reunions have had them, too. At times there have been as many as thirty bands punctuat\u00ad ing the long procession\u2014brass bands, bagpipers, fife and drum corps, all-girl bands\u2014and at the head of the column, the University Band. Rain put an occasional damper on the P-rade, but only once\u2014in 1953\u2014did it force a cancellation of the parade (and of the game). Some classes insisted on marching anyway, staging an im\u00ad promptu parade in the R.O.T.C. ar\u00ad mory. After the storm abated, the twenty-fifth-year Class of 1928 marched to \"Prospect,\" called out President Dodds, and, with him at their head, marched to University Field and back to the Cannon, accompanied by the University Band. From 1961 to 1967 the Alumni P-rade proceeded to Clarke Field, rather than to University Field, where the Engineering Quadrangle was built; and in 1966 a further change was re\u00ad quired when Yale found that it could no longer keep its team together for the post-season Princeton Commencement game. A game between the Varsity and a team of alumni provided a temporary focus for the P-rade in 1967. Since 1968 the P-rade has terminated in an Alumni Association meeting, the alumni once more marching to their Commence\u00ad ment gathering as their predecessors did in 1865\u2014now without the abundant meal and extensive oratory to follow, but with the color, music, and fun that have, since the Golden Nineties, been essential ingredients of this unique event. Alumni Weekly, The Princeton (PAW), was founded on April 7, 1900, as \". . . a long distance telephone . . . to keep a live connection between the University and its alumni. . . for their mutual en\u00ad lightenment, benefit and satisfaction.\" It replaced the Alumni Princetonian, a weekly edition of the Daily Prince\u00ad tonian that the undergraduate editors had been putting out for six years but that had sold subscriptions to only 500 of the then 6,000 alumni. Jesse Lynch Williams 1892, a former Nassau Lit editor and later a Pulitzer Prize winner, was editor of the Weekly during its first four years; he gave it (as a later editor said) \"a flying start and a bright tone.\" Edwin Mark Norris 1895, the second editor, devoted twenty-one years to the magazine. Subsequent editors and their years of service have been: W. Irving Harris '20 (1925), Asa S. Bushnell '21 (1925-1930), John T. (1930), '22 (1930-1931), 1955), John (1955-1969), Landon Y. Jones, Jr. '66 (1969-1974) and since 1975, Charles L. Creesy '65. These editors have all doubtless shared the hope expressed by the fourth editor, Asa Bushnell, that, \"in the thousands of widely scattered Princeton homes, the query 'Has the Weekly come yet?' might be heard more regularly than 'What, is the Weekly here again?' \" They would probably assent, also, to the valedictory statement of the eleventh editor, Philip Quigg: \"With few exceptions, alumni magazines with the greatest editorial freedom are the most readable and in the long run serve best the institutions for which they exist. . . . If perchance the present editor has upon occasion been critical, we hope it may have added further ere-14 AMBASSADORS AND MINISTERS dence to the burden of his message\u2014 that Princeton is the best old place of all.\" Published and printed by Princeton University Press, with an editorial board of five members (three of whom are appointed by the Alumni Council, two by the Press), the magazine is dis\u00ad tributed to virtually every alumnus through group subscriptions paid for by the classes and until 1977 was the only college alumni publication in the United States appearing weekly. That fall, it changed to biweekly publication during the academic year in order to offset rising costs and also to give the staff time to cover campus news more thoroughly in larger issues. The change only involved a reduction from twenty-eight to twenty-one issues a year, and PAW, as it was now formally known, still led all other American alumni magazines in the number of is\u00ad sues published annually. The 1977 change also affected the Weekly's association with the quarterly magazine University, founded in 1959 as a means of communication with alumni of the Graduate School, parents of undergraduates, and other non- alumni friends. Under the new ar\u00ad rangement, University was to be made up of articles previously printed in PAW, with University's retiring editor, William McCleery, serving as consult\u00ad ing editor during the transitional year. University had a turn-of-the-century counterpart in another quarterly which began in 1889 as the Princeton College Bulletin (after 1896 the Princeton Uni\u00ad versity Bulletin) and continued until 1904. The Bulletin contained in ru\u00ad dimentary form some of the features of both the Alumni Weekly and Univer\u00ad sity, as well as of the Weekly Bulletin and the Bibliography of Princeton Pub\u00ad lications.

American Philosophical Society, The, the oldest learned society in the LTnited States, was formed by Benjamin Franklin in 1743 and reorganized in its present form in 1769. It resulted from \"A Proposal for Promoting Useful Knowledge Among the British Planta\u00ad tions in America,\" which Franklin cir\u00ad culated among a carefully selected number of \"ingenious Men residing in the several colonies.\" The society's Transactions (the oldest continued periodical in North America) and Proceedings include scholarly books, monographs, papers, and re-AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY 19 search reports that are distributed throughout the world. Erected in 1789, its headquarters, Philosophical Hall, is, after Independence Hall, the oldest building now standing on Independ\u00ad ence Square in Philadelphia. The so\u00ad ciety's library contains collections par\u00ad ticularly strong in Frankliniana, the his\u00ad tory of science and culture in America, and North American Indian linguistics and archaeology. The society makes re\u00ad search grants, awards prizes, and, at its twice yearly meetings, provides for its members the companionship, in Ben\u00ad jamin Franklin's words, \"of sensible, virtuous and elegant minds.\" The fields for selection of new mem\u00ad bers are: 1) mathematical and physical sciences; 2) geological and biological sciences; 3) social sciences; 4) hu\u00ad manities; 5) administration, the fine arts, and public affairs. Membership is limited to 500 residents of the United States and 100 residents of foreign countries.

Five Princetonians\u2014four professors and one trustee\u2014have been president of the society: William Berryman Scott from 1918 to 1925; Henry Norris Rus\u00ad sell in 1931 and 1932; Roland S. Morris (a trustee of the University), from 1932 to 1942; Edwin Grant Conklin from 1942 to 1945 and from 1948 to 1952; and Julian P. Boyd, from 1973 to 1976. Professor Conklin was executive officer of the society from 1936 to 1942, Dean Eisenhart from 1942 to 1959. American Studies, The Program in (formerly American Civilization), was created by the Faculty on January 12, 1942, just five weeks after the United States entered the Second World War. Its aim was to give undergraduates an understanding of their own civilization and an appreciation of its significance among other world civilizations. The program began at an opportune time, but, as President Dodds said in an\u00ad nouncing it, \"it was not rushed to the printer to meet the demands of the hour,\" but was rather the product of a year's deliberation. Interdepartmental in character, the program draws its faculty and students from thirteen cooperating departments: Anthropology, Architecture and Urban Planning, Art and Archaeology, Eco\u00ad nomics, English, History, Music, Philosophy, Politics, Psychology, Reli\u00ad gion, Sociology, and the Woodrow Wil\u00ad son School. Each student in the program majors in one of the cooperating departments, with as much emphasis on the Ameri\u00ad can field as the regulations of his de\u00ad partment permit, and devotes his senior thesis to a topic related to American civilization. He also takes the program's one-term introductory course in the sophomore year, and its two one-term conferences in the junior year. The work of the conferences in-ANNUAL GIVING 21 volves a cooperative study by students and faculty of a significant feature of American civilization, the reading of a paper by each student in the confer\u00ad ence, and lectures by faculty spe\u00ad cialists, visiting scholars, and public figures. Guest speakers have included Lewis Mumford, Margaret Mead, Reinhold Niebuhr, Frances Perkins, Perry Miller, Helen Lynd, Oscar Handlin\u2014and Fidel Castro, whose visit to Princeton the night of April 20, 1959, to address the Conference on \"The United States and the Revolutionary Spirit\" soon after he became the pre\u00ad mier of the Republic of Cuba, caused a campus-wide sensation. For the faculty, the conference has been a means of cooperative scholar\u00ad ship and publication. Books that have grown out of the conference have in\u00ad cluded: Foreign Influences in American Life (1944), Evolutionary Thought in America (1950), Socialism and Ameri\u00ad can Life (2 vols., 1952), Religion in American Life (4 vols., 1961), and Blacks in America: Bibliographical Essays (1972). Professor Willard Thorp (English), the prime mover in the formulation of the program, was its chairman from 1942 to 1955. Other chairmen have been Stow S. Persons (History), James Ward Smith (Philosophy), John William Ward (History), Laurence B. Holland (Eng\u00ad lish), Richard M. Ludwig (English), James M. Banner, Jr. (History), James M. McPherson (History), Emory B. El\u00ad liott, Jr. (English). During World War II, the program conducted week-end courses in Ameri\u00ad can studies for members of the British armed services stationed in this coun\u00ad try. In gratitude the British govern\u00ad ment later sent the University a stone from the bombed-out House of Com\u00ad mons, which i\u00a3 embedded in the wall at the right of the main entrance to Fire\u00ad stone Library. Annual Giving, the University's most important source of unrestricted operating income, began in 1940-1941. That first year, the organization and the \"know-how\" of later years were lacking, and the results were modest: 18 per\u00ad cent of the alumni and a few friends contributed $80,000. But the underly\u00ad ing spirit of this enterprise was evident from the start: one alumnus gave the proceeds of a short story he had just published, another let his class agent cash in two Yale football tickets he couldn't use, and all 150 members of the Class of 1898 contributed, making them the first class to achieve 100 per\u00ad cent participation. President Dodds told the class agents, \"You men have started something which may well grow to be the most effective force for prog\u00ad ress at Princeton.\" In the second year, contributions picked up after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and when the campaign ended, 25 percent of the alumni, and friends, had given $102,000. During the war, foreign currency came in from alumni stationed in military theatres throughout the world; a Class of 1923 lieutenant colonel in Italy sent a thousand-lira note in Allied Military currency, its modest value enhanced by Marlene Dietrich's autograph. Contributions grew steadily in the postwar period, and the tenth year, 1949-1950, the half-million dollar mark was passed. Non-alumni parents, in their second year of participation, con\u00ad tributed $60,000. This pioneering pro\u00ad gram, which eventually brought ward of $100,000 annually from ap\u00ad proximately 2,000 non-alumni parents, was adopted by many other colleges. Six years later, in 1955-1956, the 22 ANNUAL GIVING million-dollar mark was passed. Mean\u00ad time, alumni participation was also growing steadily, and in 1958-1959 it reached 72.2 percent, the best attained by any college in the United States up to then. Contributing to this record were 2,000 alumni workers in some three hundred cities here and abroad, who followed up the appeals of sixty- odd class agents with telephone calls and visits, in a program that had been started in 1947-1948. Their work was especially valuable in combating pro\u00ad crastination, which is not only a thief of time but, Annual Giving holds, a cause, if not cured, of Lybunts. A Lybunt is one who gave Last Year But Not This. Regional workers also helped in recruit\u00ad ing Tybnols. A Tybnol (another Princeton-originated term) is one who gave This Year But Not Last. The Class of 1898, which had 100 percent participation the first year of Annual Giving, continued blissfully ig\u00ad norant of both Lybunts and Tybnols, maintaining their perfect record for twenty-five years. In the 1960s, total contributions in\u00ad creased dramatically in response to ex\u00ad panding University needs. \"More is expected of us,\" President Goheen told his fellow alumni, \"because more is ex\u00ad pected of Princeton. There is more to be learned today; more to be done.\" In the silver anniversary year, 1964-1965, Annual Giving celebrated \"twenty-five years of thoughtful dependable sup\u00ad port\" by exceeding $2 million for the first time. Three years later, it reached the $3 million plateau. In 1962 and again in 1968, Princeton received the American Alumni Coun\u00ad cil's Grand Award for Sustained Per\u00ad formance in Annual Giving; no other university had received this award more than once. One factor in the rapid rise in total contributions in the 1960s was the growing participation of Graduate School alumni, first begun in 1957- 1958. The seventy-eight contributors the first year had grown to 1,000 ten years later. Another factor was the sup\u00ad port of corporations, who matched gifts of Princeton employees in a plan initi\u00ad ated in 1954-1955 by General Electric and who, in some cases, made addi\u00ad tional corporate contributions. This support grew steadily until Annual Giv\u00ad ing was receiving between $300,000 and $400,000 annually from 450 corpo\u00ad rations. But the most important factor was the rivalry among alumni classes vying for the honor of contributing the most to Princeton. The Class of 1922 was the first to top $100,000, just be\u00ad fore its forty-second reunion in 1964. Thereafter, classes preparing for major reunions led the way. In 1966, the Classes of 1926 and 1941 passed the $200,000 mark, and a year later, the Class of 1942 topped $300,000. In 1971 the fiftieth reunion Class of 1921 broke the $400,000 barrier, and three years later the twenty-fifth reunion Class of 1949 became Annual Giving's first half-million dollar class. The 1949 class agent, Ralph Glendinning, had started a few years earlier to prepare his class\u00ad mates for their achievement with this counsel: \"Make your contribution pro\u00ad portionate to Princeton's place in higher education\u2014and to what having gone to Princeton has meant to you, your career, and your family.\" In 1971-1972 a special Annual Giving effort in honor of President Goheen, on the eve of his retirement, brought in a record-breaking total of $3,805,872. The following year, another special ef\u00ad fort in honor of newly elected President Bowen produced another record: $3,955,842. These results, President Bowen told the alumni, demonstrated DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY 23 once again their pride and confidence in Princeton. \"We thank you for your trust,\" he said. \"We shall strive to live up to it.\" Following eight consecutive years in the $3 million range, contributions to Annual Giving in 1975-1976 exceeded $4 million for the first time in the pro\u00ad gram's thirty-six-year history. In the same year two other major records were set when the Class of 1951 be\u00ad came the first twenty-fifth reunion class to contribute as much as $700,000, and the fiftieth reunion Class of 1926 be\u00ad came the first class to pass the $2 mil\u00ad lion mark in accumulated contribu\u00ad tions. The total achievement in the year of the nation's bicentennial\u2014$4.4 million\u2014represented a 26 percent in\u00ad crease over the previous year, the greatest one-year jump in Annual Giv\u00ad ing history. This record sum was the equivalent of income from the endow\u00ad ment of more than $100 million. Credit for Annual Giving's perennial success belongs, in part, to its small professional staff, which has been headed by Edgar M. Gemmell '34, Edward A. Myers '38, George J. Cooke, Jr. '22, Arthur J. Horton '42, and Joseph L. Bolster, Jr. '52. Credit also belongs to the legions of dedicated volunteers who have worked so effec\u00ad tively under the leadership of the An\u00ad nual Giving chairmen, and who have each year, in the words of one chair\u00ad man, \"sacrificed their evenings, their weekends, and perhaps, temporarily, even the affection of their long- suffering families\" to earn Princeton's \"abiding thanks for a job well done.\" Annual Giving chairmen, since the be\u00ad ginning, have been: Harold H. Helm '20, Richard L. Kennedy '28, Ernest C. Savage '19, Richard K. Stevens '22, S. Penick '25, Geoffrey Harry 17, Arthur Gard\u00ad ner '23, Macpherson Raymond '40, Amos Eno '32, Edward C. '42, F. Newberry H. Hahn '34, P. Hazlehurst, Jr. '40, John F. Maloney, '35, Winthrop A. Short '41, Sharon Clay Risk '43, III '51, and Charles T. BeI- lingrath '56. Anthropology, The Department of, was established at Princeton in 1971; the main emphasis was placed on the study of cultural and social anthropol\u00ad ogy including linguistics, and because it was a small department, neither archaeology nor physical anthropology was stressed. Within a few years, the department developed a reputation as a place for specialized work in the theoretical problems of symbolism and cultural change\u2014areas of research within cultural anthropology that were undergoing a good deal of ferment and development during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Faculty and graduate re\u00ad search focused on such topics, among others, as religious systems; ritual per\u00ad formances; political ideologies; lan\u00ad guage and its to culture; myth and folktales; cultural conceptions of kinship; and psychological aspects of culture, drama, art, and folklore. Princeton's first course in cultural an\u00ad thropology was given in 1946 by Sociol\u00ad ogy Professor Kingsley Davis; this in\u00ad troductory course was subsequently taught for ten years by Sociology Pro\u00ad fessor Melvin Tumin, and then at vari\u00ad ous times until 1965 by anthropologists Lloyd A. Fallers, Paul J. Bohannan, Peter Kunstadter, and David W. Crabb\u2014all frontiersmen of Princeton anthropology, who were responsible for 24 SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE AND URBAN PLANNING developing additional undergraduate and graduate courses in the field. Originally, anthropology was a part of the curriculum of the Department of Economics and Social Institutions. This department divided in 1960, when the Department of Sociology and An\u00ad thropology was established. In 1965 a separate Program in Anthropology was launched; it was directed by a faculty committee under the chairmanship of Cyril E. Black (1965-1966), David W. Crabb (1966-1970), and Martin G. Sil\u00ad verman (1970-1971). In 1971 an independent Department of Anthropology was established, with Martin Silverman as first chairman. He was succeeded by Hildred Geertz in 1973, and by James W. Fernandez in 1978. Hildred Geertz Architecture and Urban Planning, The School of, was founded in 1919 (as the School of Architecture) under the lead\u00ad ership of Howard Crosby Butler 1892, but architectural study had begun at Princeton almost a century earlier with physicist Joseph Henry's (q.v.) arrival in 1832. Among Henry's hobbies was the study of construction, design, and landscaping. His drawings formed the basis for the first long-range building plans of the College, and the quad\u00ad rangle in back of Nassau Hall remains approximately as he laid it out. He gave lectures on the history and appreciation of architecture, later continued by Al\u00ad bert B. Dod 1822, a mathematician. In\u00ad terest was sufficient in the 1860s to generate plans for a four-year profes\u00ad sional course in architecture, but noth\u00ad ing came of these plans. Two names are important in the record of architectural teaching at Princeton, Allan Marquand 1874 and Howard Crosby Butler 1892. Professor Marquand, an art historian and head of the Department of Art and Archaeol\u00ad ogy, began the first regular instruction in architecture in 1882; he inspired many architects as well as artists and art history teachers. It was largely due to his influence that Butler, an ar\u00ad chaeologist, returned to the Princeton faculty in 1902. Thereafter, architec\u00ad tural courses were offered regularly by Butler in the Department of Art and Archaeology. A renewed effort to create a profes\u00ad sional course in architecture was begun in 1916 by a group of former Princeton students who had gone on to architec\u00ad tural schools and who had found their work at Princeton an admirable founda\u00ad tion for professional training. After the war, in 1919, Butler announced that Princeton would offer professional training in architecture. The principles on which that training would be based are similar to those of today. It was Princeton's belief that an architect should have a well-rounded education in liberal studies and should approach his profession primarily as an art, that he should understand and appreciate other arts in relation to architecture, and that he should be taught the sci\u00ad ence of building construction as a part of his training in design, rather than as an end in itself. Princeton inaugrated the plan for an architectural course that would begin in freshman year and con\u00ad tinue without break through two years of graduate work, leaving room for the inclusion of liberal electives. Within the last decade most architectural schools have abandoned their five-year programs in favor of a similar six-year plan of study. The first student to re\u00ad ceive a professional degree in architec\u00ad ture from Princeton was Robert B. O'Connor M. EA. 1920, a graduate of SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE AND URBAN PLANNING 25 Trinity College, who later followed Stephen F. Voorhees '00 as the Univer\u00ad sity's supervising architect. Raymond Bossange was made direc\u00ad tor of the school upon the death of Howard C. Butler; he in turn was fol\u00ad lowed by Sherley W. Morgan '13. Mor\u00ad gan was first appointed to an instructor- ship in architectural drawing in 1916, and after World War I he and E. Baldwin Smith Ph. D. 1915 returned as assistant professors. These two teachers were responsible for the school's devel\u00ad opment over the next thirty years, and succeeded in making Princeton's School of Architecture one of the foremost in the country. Sherley Morgan appointed Jean Labatut as resident design critic in 1928 following Frederic D'Amato's untimely death. This appointment was made upon the recommendation of two alumni of the school, Alexander P. Morgan '22 and Gordon McCormick '17, who had worked with Labatut in Paris. Jean Labatut's ability to bring out the best in his students, his sound judgment, and his artistic integrity contributed greatly to the success of the school during his thirty-nine- year teaching career at Princeton. The school was awarded many medals in national competitions, and individual students won five Paris prizes and four Rome prizes in architecture as well as other awards during Labatut's tenure. He himself was the first recipient of the award for distinction in education jointly sponsored by the American In\u00ad stitute of Architects and the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture. Many of Labatut's students are cur\u00ad rently teaching architecture all over the world and many are deans or directors of their schools. In 1930 Frank Lloyd Wright gave his first lectures in the United States at Princeton. These lectures, sponsored by the Kahn Foundation, were later published as a monograph, Modern Architecture\u2014Wright's first American book on his philosophy and his work. Princeton entered the urban plan\u00ad ning field with the creation of the Bureau of Urban Research in 1941, founded by Jean Labatut and managed by an interdepartmental committee, to establish source material for urban studies. Melville C. Branch '34, its first director, was ably assisted by Dorothy Whiteman. As part of the Bicentennial Celebration, 1946-1947, the school was able to conduct a three-day conference on Planning Man's Physical Environ\u00ad ment, which was directed by Arthur C. Holden 12 and Henry A. Jandl M. FA. 1937. It brought together leading ar\u00ad chitects, teachers, planners and writers from all over the world, including Alvar Aalto, Frederick J. Adams, Sigfried Giedion, Contreras, Mies Van der Rohe, William Wurster and others. The final session juxtaposed the con\u00ad trasting views of its principal speakers Robert Moses and Frank Lloyd Wright. Another important innovation, in 1949, was the Princeton Architectural Laboratory, a center for experimenta\u00ad tion in architectural expression and technology. Here Princeton's contribu\u00ad tions to architectural research were be\u00ad gun, and later, a pioneer study on metal curtain walls for buildings was conducted. The results of this study were published from 1953 to 1957, after Robert W. McLaughlin '21 had as\u00ad sumed the directorship of the school following Sherley W. Morgan's retire\u00ad ment in 1952. Also during this period the brothers Victor and Aladar Olgyay conducted a systematic study of the ef\u00ad fects of climate and environment upon man and his shelter. Their book, Solar 26 HAMILTON FISH ARMSTRONG Control and Shading Devices remains the primary source for architects and planners in the field of architecture and its relation to the physical environ\u00ad ment. Under McLaughlin's directorship the school became an entity separate from the Department of Art and Ar\u00ad chaeology in 1952. As the school ex\u00ad panded, the included many vis\u00ad iting Peres- sutti from Milan and Sven Silow from Stockholm. Another frequent visitor to the school, R. Buckminster Fuller, in\u00ad spired students with the investigations he conducted in architectural structural theory. During one of his visits, the students designed, fabricated, and built a 40-foot tension-integrity sphere at the laboratory. In 1963 the school moved from its cramped quarters in McCormick Hall to its new home, a building designed by a Baltimore architectural firm of which two principals were Princeton alumni, Charles Nes '28 and L. McLane Fisher '23. In 1963, also, the school lost by retirement one of its most active teachers, Francis A. Comstock '19, a member of its faculty for almost forty years. In 1965 Robert W. McLaughlin re\u00ad tired as director of the school. In rec\u00ad ognition of the increasing role which the school had assumed within the University during his administration, the title of director was changed to dean. Robert L. Geddes was appointed the first dean, and Henry A. Jandl be\u00ad came executive ofiBcer in charge of departmental administration. Under Geddes's leadership new faculty were added and changes were instituted in the curriculum, emphasizing values, concepts and methods, to provide the beginning architectural student with the broadest possible liberal education and, at the same time, to provide intro\u00ad ductory courses for students in other disciplines in the area of urban studies, and man-made environment, and his\u00ad torical studies. The Research Center for Urban and Environmental Planning was estab\u00ad lished in 1966. One of its first contract projects in 1967 was a Planning and Design Workbook for Community Par\u00ad ticipation. At this time, the name of the School of Architecture was changed to include Urban Planning, and concur\u00ad rently the school established a master's degree program in urban planning in cooperation with the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Af\u00ad fairs. These innovations, soon followed by a Ph.D. program in urban planning, represented a major step by the school in meeting the challenge of the chang\u00ad ing needs and goals of society. Henry A. Jandl Armstrong, Hamilton Fish 16 (1893- 1973), was a founder and for fifty years editor of the American quarterly review Foreign Affairs. He was born and lived all his life on West Tenth Street in New York; his book Those Days recounts the experi\u00ad ence of growing up in Greenwich Vil\u00ad lage. In his undergraduate years he showed his editorial bent by earning places on the Nassau Lit and the Daily Princetonian. As editorial chairman of the Prince his senior year, when women's suffrage was being debated in New Jersey, he spoke out in favor of giving the vote to \"the other half\" of the human race. But his interest in international matters was a later devel\u00ad opment. At graduation he reported to the Nassau Herald that he was still un\u00ad decided about his future occupation, and it was not until he became a mili-DEPARTMENT OF ART AND ARCHAEOLOGY 27 tary attache in Belgrade at the end of the First World War that his life-long interest in foreign affairs was kindled. During his half-century with Foreign Affairs, he traveled widely, studied closely the problems of many countries, and came to know the leading states\u00ad men of the world. His knowledge and judgment in assessing international problems gave the quarterly a worldwide reputation and influence. Everyone who knew him was im\u00ad pressed by the rare personal qualities of \"the Gentleman from Tenth Street,\" as James Reston called him. Ar\u00ad thur Schlesinger, Jr., said he treated everyone, \"old or young, famous or un\u00ad known, with the same generous cour\u00ad tesy and concern. It was more than manner . . .; it was a genuine youthful- ness of mind and openness of heart.\" In his eightieth year Armstrong summed up his thoughts about Ameri\u00ad ca's place in the world with these words: The direction is not backward in nos\u00ad talgia, to the virtues of our fore\u00ad fathers. . . . The direction is for\u00ad ward, to recognize and accept the present ills of our society and to set about curing them\u2014by rehumaniz- ing ourselves, by readopting civility as part of good behavior, by recogniz\u00ad ing that history can inform the future . . . by welcoming diversity of opin\u00ad ion as an essential element of strength in a democracy. Art and Archaeology, The Department of, has had a long and illustrious his\u00ad tory. Its rudimentary beginnings go back to a course of lectures on architec\u00ad ture given first in 1832 by physicist Joseph Henry (q.v.), Professor of Natu\u00ad ral Philosophy. The year before, the study of Roman antiquities had been mentioned in the catalogue\u2014an indica\u00ad tion that Princeton was the first college to offer the subject of archaeology. Fifty years later, in 1882, Allan Marquand (q.v.), the first great name in the de\u00ad partment's history, was appointed to the faculty. Marquand, with Charles Eliot Norton of Harvard, shares the dis\u00ad tinction of having been the first to see the immense cultural benefit of the his\u00ad tory of art to the American student and to introduce its serious study into American university life. Before the end of the nineteenth century Mar\u00ad quand taught ancient art and archaeol\u00ad ogy, Arthur L. Frothingham taught \"monastic art,\" and Howard Crosby Butler (q.v.), who later became first Master of the Graduate College, gave graduate courses in early Christian and mediaeval architecture. Thus Princeton was the first college to offer consistent undergraduate and graduate work in classical and mediaeval art\u2014subjects that have never ceased to play a domi\u00ad nant part in the department's history. During the first quarter of the twen\u00ad tieth century, Marquand was not only writing his famous books on the della Robbia family of sculptors, but, as the department's first chairman, was build\u00ad ing a staff of scholars in the history of art whose teaching and writing during the second quarter of the century were to bring Princeton national and interna\u00ad tional renown. Among them were Charles Rufus Morey (q.v.), who be\u00ad came the most formidable historian of mediaeval art in America; Frank Jewett Mather, Jr., a gifted writer on many as\u00ad pects of art who gave courses on Italian and northern European painting; George Elderkin, historian of Greek art; Albert M. Friend, masterly precep\u00ad tor and brilliant medievalist; and W. Frederick Stohlman, another fine mediaevalist, who also gave enlighten-28 DEPARTMENT OF ART AND ARCHAEOLOGY ing lectures on Renaissance sculpture. The two decades after Morey became chairman in 1924 were the depart\u00ad ment's period of greatest power and influence. Morey rounded out the de\u00ad partment by appointing five new mem\u00ad bers, all added to Princeton's fame: two mediaevalists\u2014Ernest De- WaId, who also gave a popular course in Italian painting, and Kurt Weitz- mann, the celebrated Byzantinist; George Rowley, the father of Princeton's studies in Far Eastern art; Richard Stillwell, the distinguished classical archaeologist; and Donald Eg\u00ad bert, whose courses in American art and architecture widely influenced the study of these subjects in this country. Morey raised large sums of money for departmental endowment and for the Marquand Library, founded by Mar- quand and now one of the great art libraries of the world. He also estab\u00ad lished the world-famous Index of Chris\u00ad tian Art (q.v.), a photographic record with bibliography of works of Christian art produced before 1400\u2014an invalu\u00ad able aid to scholarship. And under Morey the department's great period of colonization began. While Harvard by and large staffed the country's mu\u00ad seums, Princeton in good measure provided teachers and departmental chairman for a relatively new discipline that was beginning to expand across the country. This spreading of Princeton's heritage has continued ever since. Fi\u00ad nally Morey started the department's handsome publication fund. With the Princeton Monographs in Art and Ar\u00ad chaeology (numbering 41 volumes) and with the series in the History of Manu\u00ad script Illumination, Princeton is, in programmatic publication in the history of art, ahead of every American univer\u00ad sity. Morey's successor, in 1945, was Baldwin Smith, a great teacher and an eminent historian of ancient and early Christian architecture. He added to the staff three young men who became dis\u00ad tinguished teachers and scholars in their fields: David Coffin in Renais\u00ad sance architecture; John Rupert Martin in the Baroque art of Italy and northern Europe; and Robert Koch in the Northern Renaissance, a field in which Bert Friend had earlier given a memo\u00ad rable course. During Smith's chairman\u00ad ship, Princeton's tradition of field ar\u00ad chaeology, initiated by Butler's early expedition to Sardis, and carried for\u00ad ward in the great collaborative dig at Antioch in the 1930s, entered a new phase with the model and productive excavation of the ancient Greek city of Morgantina in Sicily under Richard Stillwell and another eminent classicist who had joined the department in 1951, Eric Sjoqvist, formerly ar\u00ad chaeological secretary to King Gustav of Sweden. Under Rensselaer Lee, who suc\u00ad ceeded Smith as chairman in 1956, funds were secured for a new expedi\u00ad tion, directed by Kurt Weitzmann and by George H. Forsyth, Jr. '23 of the University of Michigan (the Vniversity of Alexandria in Egypt was a co- sponsor), to the ancient monastery of Mt. Sinai. This led to the publication by Forsyth of the monastery's architec\u00ad ture and by Weitzmann of its great apse mosaic and its unique collection of early Byzantine paintings. Also plans were completed for the new McCormick Hall and for the Art Museum (qq.v.), then ably directed by Patrick J. KeI- leher. Graduate work and museum col\u00ad lections in oriential developed im\u00ad posingly under Wen who per\u00ad suaded the eminent Japanese scholar, Shujiro Shimada, to join the faculty; and the department acquired among THE ART MUSEUM 29 others Felton Gibbons, a rising star in the field of Italian Renaissance art. Several preeminent scholars at the In\u00ad stitute for Advanced Study have greatly strengthened the graduate curriculum. Under Lee's chairmanship Erwin Panofsky was persuaded to teach courses regularly; Millard Meiss also contributed to instruction and with his wife endowed a fund for the purchase of photographs. During the chairmanship of Lee's successors, Coffin (1964-1970) and Fong (1970-1973), the department main\u00ad tained and increased its offerings in the traditional fields. It also kept up with the times in establishing new courses in twentieth-century art, Spanish art, and graphic arts, the art of Latin America, and the art of photography, the last taught by Peter Bunnell, director of the Art Museum, and first incumbent of the new chair in photography endowed by David H. McAlpin '20 in 1972. Under Coffin the department's new buildings were completed, and strong appointments in classical art were made to replace Stillwell and Sjoqvist, who had retired: Theodore Leslie Shear, Jr., field director of the excava\u00ad tions in the Athenian Agora, and Eve\u00ad lyn Harrison, the first woman to be ap\u00ad pointed a full professor in the depart\u00ad ment (lost, unfortunately, in 1974 to the graduate Institute of Fine Arts at New York University). Under Fong, one of the country's most distinguished young scholars in the field of Chinese painting, important acquisitions continued to enrich the oriental collections in the Art Museum; also three women were added to the faculty, and after coeducation the de\u00ad partment's enrollment increased nota\u00ad bly as women showed strong interest in its courses. As this is written, John R. Martin is serving his fourth year as chairman. His international repute as a teacher- scholar, his energy, and his sense of the department's great history and tradi\u00ad tion augur well for its future. Rensselaer W. Lee Art Museum, The, almost equidistant from Nassau Hall and the main portal of the Chapel, can be located from afar by Picasso's imposing \"Head of a Woman\" (one of the Putnam Memorial sculptures, q.v.), which stands in front of the glass facade. The museum's dom\u00ad inant characteristic is a refreshing openness. It shares an entrance with McCormick Hall, which houses the Department of Art and Archaeology and the Marquand Art Library, and occupies the site of the original Romanesque-style structure, built in the 1880s when the new department was organized by Allan Marquand 1874 (q.v.). He felt strongly that students should be given access to original works of art and insisted that a museum be part of the program. The department, library, and museum soon outgrew this building, but it was not until the end of the First World War that relief could be obtained. Then McCormick Hall was built to accommodate the department and library, thus allowing the museum more space in the old quarters. When Marquand retired in 1922 after four decades of developing the University's resources in art and ar\u00ad chaeology, administrative responsi\u00ad bilities were divided; C. Rufus Morey became chairman of the department and Frank Jewett Mather, Jr., became director of the museum, a position he held long past the conventional retire\u00ad ment age until men began to return from military service in World War II. Under Mather the museum continued to grow until its walls fairly bulged, but 30 THE ART MUSEUM conditions during the war and urgent priority for the University Library made it necessary to defer expansion. Ernest T. DeWaId, like his predeces\u00ad sors a specialist in Italian art, became director in 1946 and, not long before retiring in 1960, was involved with plans for the new building, designed by Steinmann and Cain and made possible by the University's $53 million drive. Completion of the plans and then two years of functioning only as an office in Green Hall Annex marked the begin\u00ad ning of Patrick J. Kelleher's di\u00ad rectorship. The excitement of installing the University's works of art in the new museum, many of them not seen for years because of inadequate space, culminated in the dedication of the building in June 1966 and in the re\u00ad warding response of enthusiastic vis\u00ad itors to the round of activities that were possible in the new structure. Peter C. Bunnell, who succeeded Kelleher as director in 1973 and returned to full- time teaching in the Department of Art and Archaeology five years later, de\u00ad veloped and guided a dynamic program that reached beyond campus and com\u00ad munity. In 1978 his successor, Fred S. Licht, came back to Princeton, where he once taught, to carry on the con\u00ad tinuous challenge of putting the Museum to stimulating use for all con\u00ad cerned with achievement in the visual arts. Many alumni and friends contributed to the new building; the entire quota was met by designated gifts. The most generous individual donor was Carl Otto von Kienbusch 06, a steady ben\u00ad efactor since his student days. The concerted effort of the Class of 1929, which adopted the museum as its spe\u00ad cial project, assured final success. Through the decades the museum has received generous help in develop\u00ading the collections. During the first years Marquand established an en\u00ad dowment for the purchase of works of art. Other endowments followed: The Caroline G. Mather Fund, given by Professor Mather, his brother and sis\u00ad ters, in memory of their mother; The Laura P. Hall Memorial Fund, left by Clifton R. Hall of the Department of History, to provide for additions to the collections of prints and drawings he bequeathed; The John Maclean Magie and Gertrude Magie Fund and the Fowler McCormick '21 for ac\u00ad quisitions; the Mildred Clarke Pressinger von Kienbusch Memorial Fund for publishing the museum's semi-annual bulletin which Mr. Kien\u00ad busch sponsored from its beginning in 1942. Several other funds, not en\u00ad dowed, but replenished periodically, give generous assistance in various areas of the museum's operation. The Friends of the Museum, formed in 1950, have provided for purchases of works of art, in addition to generating support for the exhibition program. Every museum works within defined borders to be effective. Since Prince\u00ad ton's is a teaching museum, the scope of the collections is approximately that of the art department's curriculum. It ranges in time from ancient cultures (the Mediterranean world, the\u00b7 Far East, and Meso-America) to the pres\u00ad ent. Geographically, the emphasis is upon western Europe, China and Ja\u00ad pan, Central America, and the United States. Particular areas of strength are in classical antiquities; Italian paintings; prints, photographs and drawings of European and American schools; Chi\u00ad nese paintings and ceremonial bronzes. The museum's possessions are exhib\u00ad ited on a rotating basis, which is deter\u00ad mined largely by the requirement of certain courses. Loan exhibitions are DEPARTMENT OF ASTROPHYSICAL SCIENCES 31 arranged to supplement the permanent collections, as well as to bring in mate\u00ad rial the museum does not attempt to collect. Certain collections (e.g., prints and drawings), by their nature cannot be shown frequently, but are available by appointment to serious students and scholars. Allan Marquand made many gifts, including one of the Museum's paint\u00ad ing, \"Christ before Pilate.\" Frank Jewett Mather's collection of Italian drawings includes many gems, among them a study by Carpaccio for one of his wall-paintings in Venice. The 1938 be\u00ad quest of Dan Fellows Piatt 1895 pro\u00ad vided an unusually rich concentration in drawings by Italian seventeenth- century artists; his Italian paintings in\u00ad clude important early works that dovetail well with the generally later Italian paintings given in 1935 by Henry White Cannon '10. A collection of about five hundred Chinese snuff- bottles bequeathed by James A. Blair 03 is admired by specialists and ama\u00ad teurs alike. In 1947, in honor of the University's Bicentennial, DuBois S. Morris 1893 presented his collection of Chinese paintings, which contains an outstanding Sung Dynasty landscape. Through the years Carl Otto von Kien- busch 06 underwrote the acquisition of many objects. The ideal donor, he im\u00ad posed no preferences and, as a result, the collection named in memory of his elder son and namesake represents many periods and places. A striking object in this collection, and one of the museum's masterpieces, is a poly\u00ad chrome wooden statue of Kwan Yin of the Sung Dynasty. The 1933 bequest of Junius S. Morgan 1888 brought to the museum an important group of Greek vases and an extraordinary assemblage of prints, including a nearly complete series of the engravings and etchings of Jacques Callot. A new area of collection was initiated in 1971 when David H. McAlpin '20 gave about five hundred photographs and a fund for the pur\u00ad chase of additional examples of photog\u00ad raphy as an artistic medium. The present museum and its collec\u00ad tions are a fitting fulfillment of the pio\u00ad neering efforts of the first two directors, Professors Marquand and Mather, who together served for more than half a century. A bronze plaque in the en\u00ad trance court records their great contri\u00ad bution to Princeton: BY SCHOLARSHIP, VISION, AND GENEROSITY, THEY MADE POSSIBLE A COMMUNITY OF STUDENTS AND WORKS OF ART. Frances F. Jones Astrophysical Sciences, The Depart\u00ad ment of, came into being in 1962 when the trustees and faculty approved a rec\u00ad ommendation of the Department of As\u00ad tronomy that its name be so changed and its scope enlarged to include graduate programs in plasma physics and in atomic and molecular physics as well as in astronomy and astrophysics. Astronomy at Princeton was origi\u00ad nally taught as a part of \"natural philos\u00ad ophy,\" usually by professors who were primarily mathematicians. Walter Minto, called from Scotland by Presi\u00ad dent Witherspoon in 1787 as professor of mathematics and natural philosophy, was the author of a treatise on the newly discovered planet Uranus. An\u00ad drew Hunter, Jr., Class of 1772, held the title Professor of Mathematics and Astronomy, 1804-1808. The College was proud of its Ritten- house Orrery\u2014a planetar\u00ad ium\u2014acquired in 1771, but it had diffi\u00ad culty raising funds for an observatory. 32 DEPARTMENT OF ASTROPHYSICAL SCIENCES After the Nassau Hall fire of 1802, the trustees asked John Maclean Sr., who then held the professorship of mathe\u00ad matics and natural philosophy, \"to select from the materials remaining after the rebuilding of the college such parts as may be necessary for the build\u00ad ing of an Observatory,\" but nothing came of this proposal. Astronomy began its development as a separate discipline under Stephen Al\u00ad exander who, beginning as a tutor in mathematics in 1833, was appointed professor of astronomy in 1840. He gave the first separate course in as\u00ad tronomy, made observations on a small telescope in his home, published some twenty scientific papers, and by his pa\u00ad tience and enthusiasm for his subject secured benefactions for the Halsted Observatory, completed from his plans in 1872. This observatory was one of the inducements that lured Charles A. Young from Dartmouth as Alexander's successor in 1877; others were the promise of an observatory office and residence built on Prospect Avenue in 1878, and of a 23-inch telescope in\u00ad stalled in the Halsted Observatory in 1882. Young was the founder of a distin\u00ad guished dynasty of observatory di\u00ad rectors, who with the exception of a few years, have represented a direct line of teachers and students. Seven years fol\u00ad lowing Young's retirement in 1905, Henry Norris Russell, who graduated from Princeton in 1897 and took his Ph.D. under Young in 1900, became director. On Russell's retirement thirty-five years later, he was suc\u00ad ceeded by Lyman Spitzer, Jr., who graduated from Yale in 1935 and earned his doctorate at Princeton under Rus\u00ad sell in 1938. Young pioneered in solar spectros\u00ad copy, using a spectroscope of his own devising to study the colors given off by light from the sun in order to deter\u00ad mine the elements present in the sun's atmosphere. He was the author of an authoritative work on The Sun and four textbooks, said by Harlow Shapley to be \"models of clearness and balanced presentation,\" on which most of the next generation of American astrono\u00ad mers were nurtured. While Young was primarily an ob\u00ad server, his successor, Henry Norris Russell, was chiefly a theorist who used mathematics and physics to explain the observations of others. With Eddington and Milne in England and Karl Schwarzchild in Germany, Russell laid much of the foundation of modern as\u00ad trophysics. Carrying on Young's study of the chemical composition of the sun, Rus\u00ad sell brought to the investigation exact physical theory that made it possible for the first time to specify the relative amounts of the different elements pres\u00ad ent in the sun's atmosphere. \"His de\u00ad tailed recipe for the solar atmosphere\" (in Professor Spitzer's words) is known to astronomers as the \"Russell mixture\" and has been widely used in theoretical work on the sun and the stars. The sur\u00ad prisingly overwhelming abundance of hydrogen which he found (92 percent by volume) was later confirmed by others for stars in general and exerted a profound influence on all of astronomy. Russell also became a leading author\u00ad ity on stellar evolution\u2014the birth, growth, decay, and death of a star. He and the Danish astronomer, Einar Hertzsprung, independently discov\u00ad ered a certain regularity in the relation\u00ad ship between the brightness of stars, their colors, and their spectral class; the diagram illustrating this relationship is usually called the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. DEPARTMENT OF ASTROPHYSICAL SCIENCES 33 Under Russell, Princeton became the foremost center for the analysis of eclipsing variables: double stars\u2014so close together they appear as a single star\u2014whose orbital motion around one another, accompanied by periodic eclipses, results in a systematic change in brightness, which when measured can be used to learn the relative sizes of the two stars9 Russell worked out the theory and method of analysis in 1912, and for many years the most precise measurements of light variations were made by his colleague, Raymond S. Dugan, in thousands of painstaking ob\u00ad servations. Another colleague, Newton L. Pierce, who studied under Dugan, carried on his teacher's work, using electronic techniques. Professors Russell, Dugan, and John Q. Stewart collaborated on a two- volume textbook (1927) that \"essen\u00ad tially revolutionized astronomical teaching and astronomical textbook writing in America.\" On Russell's retirement in 1947 Lyman Spitzer, Jr., succeeded him as director of the Observatory and, sev\u00ad eral years later, as Charles A. Young Professor of Astronomy. At the same time Martin Schwarzschild, then thirty-five, was called from Columbia as professor of astronomy; he was later appointed Eugene Higgins Professor of Astronomy. The appointment of Spitzer, one of Russell's students, and of Schwarzschild, son of Russell's famous contemporary, Karl Schwarzs\u00ad child, led to a dramatic expansion in Princeton's role as a center of astronom\u00ad ical research, mostly in the two fields of theoretical astrophysics and of observa\u00ad tional space astronomy. This expansion has been financed in part by University funds, in part by substantial grants from the federal government through the Office of Naval Research, the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Air Force. Spitzer has continued Russell's work in theoretical astrophysics, making pioneering calculations of the tempera\u00ad ture of the very rare gases in interstel\u00ad lar space and investigating many as\u00ad pects of the problem of star formation. Schwarzschild has also carried on the study of stellar evolution begun by Rus\u00ad sell, with his investigations on the inte\u00ad rior of stars, confirming, for the interior of the sun, Russell's discovery of the great abundance of hydrogen and helium in the solar atmosphere. By careful calculation of the changes in the interior of a Star due to the burning of its nuclear fuel, Schwarzschild has been able to find its age corresponding to a given present position on the Hertz- sprung-Russell diagram. In 1951 Spitzer instituted on the For- restal Research Campus a program (originally called Project Matterhorn but later named the Plasma Physics Laboratory) for studies of basic plasma physics and the possibilities of con\u00ad trolled thermonuclear power. This pro\u00ad gram brought an influx of specialists in plasma physics who have given Princeton great strength in a basic sub\u00ad ject that may hold the key for solving the future energy problems of man\u00ad kind: John M. Dawson, Edward A. Frieman, Harold P. Furth, Melvin B. Gottlieb, Martin D. Kruskal, Russell Kulsrud, Carl R. Oberman, Thomas H. Stix, and Shoichi Yoshikawa. Schwarzschild has pioneered in the use of giant balloons to hoist telescopes 80,000 feet into the stratosphere, to get clearer pictures of the sun and other stars and planets. In a series of flights in 1957 and 1959 a 12-inch balloon tele\u00ad scope (Stratoscope I) enabled Schwarzs\u00ad child and his associates to obtain the 34 ATHLETICS sharpest and most detailed photographs of the sun ever taken. A 36-inch balloon telescope (Stratoscope II) was devel\u00ad oped in 1963 and was used to obtain unprecedentedly sharp photographs of planets and stellar systems. Before his death in 1976, Professor Robert E. Danielson was closely associated with Schwarzschild in this work. Spitzer has also been responsible for conceiving and developing, as part of NASA's Orbiting Astronomical Obser\u00ad vatory program, a special satellite proj\u00ad ect to study the composition and physi\u00ad cal structure of inter-stellar gases and dust clouds in space. This equipment, which was launched in August 1972 on a satellite named Copernicus, contains a 32-inch telescope, an ultraviolet spec\u00ad trometer, and auxiliary electronic equipment to measure the ultraviolet light absorption characteristics of cos\u00ad mic clouds and the gaseous atmos\u00ad pheres of the brighter stars. Coper\u00ad nicus is in earth orbit at a height of about 500 miles, well beyond the 30 or 40 mile ozone layer, where the strong absorption of ultraviolet light by the ozone precludes such measurements. Astronomers from all over the world have come to Princeton to use this in\u00ad strument in their researches. John B. Rogerson has been associated with Spitzer on this project; other members of the group have been Kurt Dressier, Donald C. Morton, Donald G. York, and Edward B. Jenkins. Morton has headed up another in\u00ad novative program in space astronomy. By means of equipment carried 80 miles high in a rocket, he and his as\u00ad sociates were able to make observations of stars from above the earth's atmos\u00ad phere. In 1965 they launched a rocket carrying a telescope with photographic equipment, which obtained for the first time detailed spectra of two stars in ul\u00adtraviolet wavelengths which do not reach Earth's surface. Since that time other Princeton rocket-carried tele\u00ad scopes have obtained additional such information previously denied to as\u00ad tronomers. In particular, this program has unexpectedly shown that hot stars are blowing their atmospheres out into space at speeds of thousands of miles per second. The department's facilities were greatly enhanced in 1966 by the instal\u00ad lation of a 36-inch reflecting telescope in the FitzRandolph Observatory, which had been built in 1934 to replace the Halsted Observatory, and by the completion of the department's modern home, Peyton Hall, which replaced its former headquarters in the old Obser\u00ad vatory of Instruction on Prospect Av\u00ad enue. The appointment in 1971 of John N. Bahcall as professor of astronomy in the Institute for Advanced Study, succeed\u00ad ing Bengt Stromgren, who first held this position, further intensified the light given off by Princeton as a center for the astrophysical sciences, as has the presence from time to time, as visit\u00ad ing professors at the Princeton Observ\u00ad atory, of luminaries such as Walter rahmanyan Hoyle (England), Jan H. Oort (The Netherlands). Athletics. Until 1800 outdoor exercise for Princeton students usually took the form of walking, horseback riding, canoeing down the Millstone River, and hunting small game in the hills and fields nearby. The first quarter of the nineteenth century saw an increase in more violent forms of physical activity, including occasional duels and frequent struggles with \"townies\" when the cry ATHLETICS 35 of \"Nassau! Nassau!\" would bring half- clad students rushing from their beds to rescue their comrades and defend the college honor. Although there were no intercol\u00ad legiate football contests until 1869, as early as 1844 the quadrangle between East and West College was the scene of many spirited football games. Fre\u00ad quently the entire student body would turn out, divide themselves into teams, and endeavor to kick the ball until it touched the wall of either East or West College. The fall of 1857 brought a more organized form of athletics with the formation of a cricket club and two baseball clubs. The following year saw the emergence of the Nassau Baseball Club, which played its first game away from Princeton two years later. During the early days the teams had little system or organization; the best player was usually the leader. The first step toward a more formal mode of op\u00ad eration occurred when the players elected one of their members as cap\u00ad tain, with sole charge and management of the games and players. The next step was the development of the Football and Baseball, and later the Track, Asso\u00ad ciations, whose student boards of di\u00ad rectors ran into criticism after gradually usurping the authority of the captains and were reduced in 1876 to two-man undergraduate committees. The alumni were admitted to a share of management in 1885 when a graduate advisory committee of three was established by the Baseball Associ\u00ad ation. This scheme was so well received that, before the year closed, the various student associations had agreed to give the graduate advisory committee gen\u00ad eral supervision over all athletics of the college\u2014the first step toward consoli\u00ad dation of athletic interests. In 1886 an executive committee composed of un\u00addergraduate representatives from all the associations was organized to take charge of the grounds and general ath\u00ad letic interests of the college. The final steps toward consolidation came with the adoption of an alumni proposal that each association turn over all surplus monies at the year's end to a University Fund managed by a regularly elected officer eventually known as the general athletic treasurer. In 1890 the graduate and under\u00ad graduate committees joined in the for\u00ad mation of the Princeton University Ath\u00ad letic Association, a year later incorpo\u00ad rated under the laws of New Jersey. The general athletic treasurer became the first full-time officer to have ad\u00ad ministrative responsibility for all ath\u00ad letic programs. At the same time, the faculty ap\u00ad pointed a committee on outdoor sports to investigate and approve the aca\u00ad demic standing of the individual players and to see that games and hours of training did not interfere with study. The amalgamation of the faculty and alumni committees into a Board of Ath- letic Control came in 1900. Under the chairmanship of Dean Howard McClenahan '94, with G. R. Murray '93 as general athletic treasurer/secretary, this board gave general supervision to the organization of sports in Princeton. In 1923 Dr. Charles W. Kennedy '03 took over the chairmanship. Asa S. Bushnell '21 was appointed secretary of the board in 1928 and three years later became graduate manager of athletics. In 1932 Dr. Joseph E. Raycroft suc\u00ad ceeded Dr. Kennedy as chairman; the same year brought the retirement of G. R. Murray after thirty-two years of service to Princeton's athletic interests. The Board of Athletic Control was replaced by the University Council on Athletics in 1934, with Burnham N. 36 THE BACCALAUREATE ADDRESS Dell as chairman and Asa S. Bushnell secretary. In 1937 the Athletic Association was formally dissolved and reconstituted as an integral part of the University. In 1939, Bushnell left Princeton to be\u00ad come the head of the Central Office for Eastern Intercollegiate Athletics and R. Kenneth Fairman '34 was appointed graduate manager of athletics, a desig\u00ad nation changed to director of athletics in 1941. Howard Stepp was acting di\u00ad rector during Fairman's military serv\u00ad ice in World War II. The last major change in the adminis\u00ad trative structure of athletics occurred in 1947 when a single Department of Physical Education and Athletics was established, bringing the physical edu\u00ad cation and intramural programs under one departmental purview with inter\u00ad collegiate athletics. Major increases in Princeton's athletic plant took place during Fairman's leadership with the construction of the Caldwell Field House and the Jadwin Gymnasium as well as adjacent baseball, football, and lacrosse fields. Fairman also laid the groundwork for the successful entry of women into the Princeton athletic pic\u00ad ture before he retired in 1972 after 35 years in charge of Princeton athletics. Royce N. Flippin, Jr.'56 took over the directorship of physical education and athletics in 1973. Shortly after his arrival, the department added \"Recre\u00ad ation\" to its masthead in recognition of the growing interest in lifetime sports, recreational activities, and health fit\u00ad ness on the part of large numbers of the student body, faculty and staff. Samuel C. Howell Baccalaureate Address, The (originally called a sermon), is one of Princeton's oldest traditions. The earliest recorded address was delivered by President Samuel Davies in 1760 to the eleven members of the graduating class. Enti\u00ad tled \"Religion and Public Spirit,\" it treated a topic that has been a fre\u00ad quently recurring theme. \"Serve your Generation,\" he told his students. Live not for yourself but the Pub- lick. Be the Servants of the Church; the Servants of your Country; the Servants of all. . . . Esteem your\u00ad selves by so much the more happy, honourable and important, by how much the more useful you are. Let your own Ease, your own Pleasure, your own private Interests, yield to the common Good. Davies's address was delivered in the prayer hall of Nassau Hall. In modern times, the baccalaureate has been given in the University Chapel, and as in Davies's day, it takes place on the Sun\u00ad day preceding commencement. The service begins with an academic pro\u00ad cession and includes scripture readings and prayers, anthems by the choir, and hymns by the congregation. Since 1972 the address, originally delivered by the president, has been given each year by a different speaker chosen by the presi\u00ad dent from the alumni or the faculty. Speaking frpm the text \"We are un\u00ad profitable servants: we have done [only] that which was our duty to do\" (Luke 17:10), President Woodrow Wilson in 1909 told the graduating seniors that the education they had received had made them in some special sense citizens of a spiritual world in which men are ex\u00ad pected to do more than make a liv\u00ad ing; in which they are expected to enrich the day they live in with . . . something given freely, from their special store of knowledge and of in-BAKER MEMORIAL RINK 37 structed principle, for the service of their neighbors and their com\u00ad munities and for the enlightenment of mankind. (A half-century later, the Class of 1909 reprinted this sermon for their fif\u00ad tieth reunion, and Judge Harold R. Medina read it at their memorial serv\u00ad ice.) Although a common thread has run through many baccalaureates, some\u00ad times they have reflected specifically the times in which they were given. Among President Harold W. Dodds's twenty addresses, for example, one, given in 1937, during the Depression, treated the concept \"preoccupation with security breeds insecurity\"; another, delivered in 1941, the year the United States entered the Second World War, discussed \"The Anatomy of Courage\"; and a third, given in 1949, in the early days of the cold war, consid\u00ad ered the question, \"Which comes first, the integrity of the individual or the au\u00ad thority of the state?\" President Robert F. Goheen, in his last baccalaureate, in 1972, told the graduating seniors that their genera\u00ad tion, more than most of his, had an awareness of, \"indeed a passionate con\u00ad cern for,\" contemporary problems. He reminded them that the solution to these problems \"requires, more often than not, the combining of hu\u00ad manitarian empathy with much tough-mindedness, much sophisticated knowledge, and a long view.\" He em\u00ad phasized the contributions universities can make to this effort; they are, he said, \"continually trying to extend the range and precision of human under\u00ad standing, and . . . to help us make con\u00ad tact with the deepest resources of human wisdom as a basis for action.\" In 1975, Gregory Vlastos, Stuart Pro\u00adfessor of Philosophy, applied to Prince\u00ad ton the text \"Unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required\" (Luke 12:48), and cited two principal obligations of the University: the pur\u00ad suit of excellence in the advancement and dissemination of knowledge, and the practice of brotherhood. Regarding the second requirement, he pointed out that in recent years Princeton had moved closer than ever before to the \"ideal of a humane community which opens its doors to all and treats all within its doors with that equal respect which is the moral right of every human being and the constitutional right of every American.\" Professor Vlastos told the seniors that the \"sacred thing we call 'a human life' \" existed in each one of them, and that for him \"the final sanction of moral\u00ad ity\" was \"reverence for that sacred thing in every human being,\" which was why he believed that \"at the deepest level\" the University's intellec\u00ad tual and moral obligations converged. Baker Memorial Rink is dedicated to the legendary Hobart Amory Hare Baker 14, one of Princeton's finest athletes. He was an Ail-American halfback noted for his headlong habit of catching punts on the run (and without a helmet), yet he found his true great\u00ad ness in hockey. In his day he was re\u00ad garded as the greatest amateur hockey player ever developed in North America. No other player had his un\u00ad canny ability to weave in and out of the opposing defense, constantly changing his pace and direction. As he would take the puck behind the Princeton goal and set fly on one of his rink-long rushes, the crowd would yell, \"Here he comes!\" When he continued his ama\u00ad teur career with the St. Nick's Club in New York, the sign \"Hobey Baker 38 THE BAND Plays Tonight\" would go up, and the line of limousines would stretch for blocks. A fighter squadron cqmmander in the First World War, he met an ironic death testing a repaired plane with his orders home in his pocket. A memorial service was held at the University, in which President Hibben declared, \"The spirit of the place was incarnate in him, the spirit of manly vigor, of honor, of fair play, and the clean game.\" Later a $250,000 campaign for an artificial-ice rink was announced as his memorial, the first collegiate rink in this country. It was an intercollegiate effort; 1,537 men from thirty-nine colleges contrib\u00ad uted, including 90 from Yale and 172 from Harvard. The building is in the familiar Gothic mode, made of random ashlar Princeton stone with pointed arches and mullioned windows. An il\u00ad luminated case standing in the lobby contains Hobey's picture, his skates, his pucks, and his biography. John D. Davies Band, The University, made a modest debut on October 9, 1920 when twenty undergraduates dressed in black sweat\u00ad ers and white flannel trousers appeared in Palmer Stadium and played Prince\u00ad ton songs during, and between halves of, the Princeton-Maryland football game. Thirty-five years later, the October 17, 1955, issue of Sports Illustrated pic\u00ad tured on its cover that year's Princeton band\u2014attired in orange-and-black plaid blazers, gray flannel trousers, white shoes, and straw hats\u2014to illus\u00ad trate a typical Princeton football Satur\u00ad day \"filled with the color of autumn and the noise of Princeton's highly polished [seventy-six piece] brass band\" making \"the welkin ring for Old Nassau.\" Around the same time, the band, whose numbers eventually topped a hundred, introducted satirical half-time shows and began performing, in small but lively groups, at home basketball and hockey games. In 1951, some of the marching band's more accomplished members formed a concert band, whose winter concerts in McCarter Theatre and spring concerts on the steps of Nassau Hall became Princeton traditions. Three years later, Princeton joined Yale in a New York concert (described as not \"half bad\" by a New York Times music critic, who admitted to being an ex-Harvard bandsman), and in May 1971 cele\u00ad brated the University Band's fiftieth season in a joint performance with Har\u00ad vard at Lincoln Center. During the Spring Recess of 1975, the concert band toured California, bringing its music to West Coast alumni and friends, from San Diego to San Fran\u00ad cisco. In 1969, the marching and concert bands were among the first Princeton organizations to benefit from the talents of the newly arrived women students. In recent years, the marching band has led the annual Alumni Parade, and the concert band has played the music for the Commencement procession. Conductors of the University Band have included Richard F. Goldman, 1951 to 1955; Robert L. Leist, from 1955 to 1971; and since 1971, David Uber. Baseball, Princeton's oldest sport and once one of its most popular, first came into prominence in 1858 when some freshmen from Brooklyn organized the Baseball Club of the Class of 1862 of Nassau Hall, which played intraclub matches every day except Sunday. Later, members of other classes BASEBALL 39 joined in, and on October 22, 1860, Princeton met its first outside oppo\u00ad nent, playing an Orange, New Jersey, team to a 42-42 tie (balls were livelier then and the pitching less sophisti\u00ad cated) in a long nine-inning game that was called on account of darkness. Four years later, on November 22, 1864, Princeton played its first intercollegiate game, defeating Williams 27 to 16. Four years after that, while on a tour of New England, the Princeton team helped initiate Big Three athletic com\u00ad petition (the visitors were defeated both times, by Harvard 17 to 16, by Yale 30 to 23). Three Princetonians made notable contributions to the game in the early years. William S. Gummere 1870 was the first baseball player to use the hook-slide, stealing second successfully by throwing himself feet first under the second baseman's tag, in an exhibition game with the Philadelphia Athletics in the spring of 1870. Joseph McElroy Mann 1876 was the first college pitcher to control the curve ball and use it successfully in a game. He saw Candy Cummings, a profes\u00ad sional pitcher with the Hartford, Con\u00ad necticut, Club, give an exhibition of curve-throwing in the fall of 1874, and that winter he developed his own curve ball by constant practice in the cor\u00ad ridors of Nassau Hall. His highly effec\u00ad tive use of this novel delivery, on May 29, 1875, in New Haven, Connecticut, enabled him to pitch the first no-hit game in the history of baseball, ama\u00ad teur or professional. Only two Yale bat\u00ad ters got as far as first base, on errors, and Princeton won 3 to 0. There have been half a dozen Princeton no-hitters since then, but Mann's is still the closest to a perfect game on record: he faced only 28 batters. William S. Schenck 1880 was the first catcher to use a primitive kind of chest protector: copies of the Princetonian stuffed beneath his shirt. After the 1880 Harvard game, a Boston sporting goods manufacturer learned of this contriv\u00ad ance from Schenck, and within a year had developed a rudimentary form of the present pad. Another phenomenal pitching per\u00ad formance came in Princeton's 13 to 0 victory over Yale in its Big Three championship season of 1896. In that game, pitcher Ros Easton 1898 struck out sixteen Yale batters, a record all the more remarkable because at that time no foul ball was counted as a strike. (Years later, Easton set another record when as class agent he made 1898 the first class to achieve 100 percent par\u00ad ticipation in Annual Giving.) THE CLARKE YEARS In 1897, Bill Clarke, then catcher for the Baltimore Orioles, came to Prince\u00ad ton to help correct some of the Varsity team's flaws. He returned again for short periods in 1899, 1900, and 1901, and then in 1909, on his retirement from professional baseball, became Princeton's first full-time baseball coach. The 1897 team won the Big Three championship, and so did the Clarke- helped teams of 1899,1900, and 1901. A notable player of this era was catcher Frederick Kafer 1900, whose class\u00ad mates later gave a cup in his honor, awarded annually to the outstanding varsity player. Princeton continued to win the Big Three championship with near regular\u00ad ity, failing to take it in only two years from 1903 through 1912. From 1907 through 1909, pitcher \"Biggie\" Heyn- iger '09 won every Big Three game in which he started: four against Yale and five against Harvard, four of the latter 40 BASEBALL shutouts. Against Yale in 1912, Sanford White '12, shortstop and cleanup bat\u00ad ter, scored five runs and took part in two double plays. King Lear '14 (his proper name was Charles Bernard Lear) pitched every inning of the four Big Three games in 1912, beating Yale twice and Harvard once; he later pitched for Cincinnati. Among Clarke's best teams were the 1923 team, which won 21 out of 25 games (nineteen of them in a row), and the 1924 team, which won 19 out of 23. Leading players of this period were shortstop Moe Berg '23, pitchers Char\u00ad lie Townsend \"he would do anything to get on base,\" Clarke once said, \"even to the extent of declining to respond to the instinct of self-preservation when the pitcher threw one in his direction.\" In 1924 Caldwell and Townsend shut out Yale, Caldwell 1-0 in New Haven, Townsend 7-0 in the Commencement game at Princeton. Throughout the Commencement game\u2014the last of his career\u2014Townsend coolly preserved a slowly developing no-hitter as well as a shutout, four times striking out the last Yale batter of the inning with one or two men on base. Berg later played professional base\u00ad ball for fifteen years, mostly as catcher. He was considered the most scholarly player in the big leagues, and his story-telling made him a great favorite in the bull-pen. A good student who never forgot what he had learned in Professor Bender's course in linguistic science, his talent for picking up new languages greatly impressed his team\u00ad mates on a barn-storming trip to Japan in the 1930s. During the crossing, Berg spent a good deal of time in the ship's engine-room practicing Japanese with a Japanese fireman, and when the team arrived in Tokyo, Babe Ruth and the others were grateful for Berg's ability to read signs and to talk with cab drivers and hotel clerks. In World War II, he served as a spy for the Office of Strate\u00ad gic Services and obtained valuable in\u00ad formation about Germany's progress in the race with the United States to de\u00ad velop an atomic bomb. When Clarke gave up coaching in 1927 for six years, Byrd Douglas '16, Harry B. Hooper, and then John H. Jeffries, Jr. '23 took his place. During this period, Herman A. Heydt '29 pitched sixteen innings without giving up a single walk in a 4-3 victory over Cornell his senior year. In 1934 Clarke resumed coaching for another decade. Throughout his long career, his teams generally had stronger pitching than hitting. \"Hit- ting's a gift,\" Clarke once told a Princetonian reporter investigating this phenomenon, \"just like God Almighty hanging a good arm on you.\" Provi\u00ad dence, which continued to provide Clarke with good pitchers\u2014one of them, George Lauritzen '37, pitched a 9-0 no-hitter against Lehigh in 1935\u2014 also favored him with four league bat\u00ad ting champions in his last years: Rolf Paine '37 (.452), Brooks Jones '40 (.467), Bill MacCoy '42 (.452), and Roy Talcott '43 (.385). Talcott's batting re\u00ad cord was a notable achievement for his position\u2014pitcher. In Clarke's last dec\u00ad ade, two teams won Eastern Intercol\u00ad legiate League championships\u20141941 and 1942. Talcott and MacCoy stood out among some very fine players these years. Talcott had a 12-0 pitching re\u00ad cord the first year, 9-0 the second. MacCoy, who was captain in 1942, scored the winning run in two decisive extra-inning games, against Yale in the tenth inning, against Harvard in the BASKETBALL 41 fourteenth. MacCoy was killed in a plane crash while serving in the United States Air Force in World War II; he is memorialized by a bronze plaque on Clarke Field given by his family. After Clarke's retirement in 1944, there was a seven-year interregnum be\u00ad fore the beginning of Eddie Donovan's era in 1952. Charlie Caldwell '25 coached in 1945 and 1946, Matt David\u00ad son in 1947 and 1948, and Emerson Dickman in 1949, 1950, and 1951. Caldwell's team won the Eastern Inter\u00ad collegiate League championship in 1945; Dickman's teams won it in 1949, shared it with Army in 1950, and won it again in 1951. The 1951 team, which had the best record overall (20-6) since the 1923-1924 period, also won the NCAA District 2 championship. These years were highlighted by a number of outstanding pitching per\u00ad formances. In 1945 Henry Rohner '48 won both halves of a double-header against Dartmouth, pitching all eight\u00ad een innings and allowing only three hits in each game. Bob Wolcott '48 pitched four shut-outs against Big Three teams during his three Varsity years. In 1950 sophomore Ray Chirurgi '52 was the pitcher of record in all of Princeton's league victories, and in 1951 Dave Sisler '53 had a phenomenal earned run average of 0.99; he later pitched in the major leagues for six years. DONOVAN'S QUARTER-CENTURY Eddie Donovan was coach from 1952 through 1975. His 1953 team was East\u00ad ern Intercollegiate as well as Big Three champion. Outstanding in later years were the 1960 and 1965 teams, both Big Three champions, and the 1971 team, which finished with a 22-7-1 re\u00ad cord. In 1971 Donovan was voted Dis\u00ad trict 2 Coach of the year. Good pitching continued to be Princeton's chief asset. Four pitchers threw no-hitters: Harry Brightman '52 against Fordham in 1952, Dave Doug\u00ad las '60 against Manhattan in 1960, Anton Schoolwerth '63 against C.C.N.Y. in 1961, and Graham Marcott '67 against Villanova in 1966. The 1953 pitching staff scored nine shutouts; Dick Emery '55, who pro\u00ad duced five of them, was pitcher of the year in District 2 of the NCAA. Jack Hittson '71, who had a 9-0 won-lost re\u00ad cord, was an All-American pitcher his senior year. Donovan was blessed with several outstanding hitters: Joe Golden '53 bat\u00ad ted .361 and Arnold Holtberg '70 (an All-American catcher) .356 their senior years. Bob Schiffner '71 had a three- year batting average of .332, the best in Princeton history. Ray Huard '71 set another Princeton record his senior year by hitting five home runs in a single season. Len Rivers, a member of the football coaching staff since 1973, succeeded Donovan as baseball coach at the end of the 1975 season. His 1976 team fin\u00ad ished second in the Eastern League with a 10-4 record and reached the semi-finals of the ECAC Mid-Atlantic Regionals where it was eliminated by St. John's, the eventual champion. During the season, Mike French '76 pitched five shut-outs, equaling the Princeton record set by Dick Emery '55 in 1953. Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith, a physical education instructor at Springfield College in Massachusetts, who had been asked to develop a new game that would provide an interlude between the football and baseball seasons more exciting than the gymnastic exercises the students were 42 BASKETBALL then grumbling about. Naismith thought that, indoors, it would be safer to throw a ball than kick it, and that it would be a more interesting game if, to score, the ball had to be thrown into a small receptacle. Peach baskets were used for this purpose when Naismith's ideas were first tried out, and soon the new game was called \"basketball.\" Princeton's first team, formed in 1901, played twelve games and, by vir\u00ad tue of a decisive goal by Bill Roper '02 in the last minute of the final game, ended with a 7-5 record for the season. At a postseason dinner in the old Princeton Inn the manager announced that the team had cleared expenses and had a dollar and twenty-five cents in hand for the next season. In the winter of 1901-1902, Colum\u00ad bia, Cornell, Harvard, Yale and Princeton formed the original Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League, joined in later years by Penn, Dart\u00ad mouth, and Brown. Columbia, Penn, and Yale dominated this league in the first two decades. In 1916 Princeton tied for the championship but lost the play-off game to Penn. At first the Princeton coach, usually a member of a professional team in Tren\u00ad ton, showed undergraduates how to play the game by scrimmaging against them in practice sessions, leaving sub\u00ad stituting and strategy during actual games to the captain. The first resident coach was Fred W. Luehring, who joined the newly founded Department of Hygiene and Physical Education in 1911, and coached for eight years through 1920. In the twenties, Princeton was sec\u00ad ond only to four-time champion Penn, winning championships in 1922 and 1925, losing two others by a single goal in the play-offs in 1927 and 1928, and finishing second, as well, in 1923 and 1924. The 1925 team compiled a 21-2 won-lost record, which half a century later had still not been equalled. Three Princeton seniors, James H. Lemon, Robert C. Hynson, and Stephen C. Cleaves, led the league in points scored that season. Arthur Loeb Hemmersley '24 was named Ail-American in 1922 and 1923, Carl M. Loeb, Jr. '26 in 1926. Columbia and Penn shared honors in the thirties, and Dartmouth was undis\u00ad puted leader in the forties. In 1932 Princeton tied for first place with Co\u00ad lumbia and won the play-off for the championship, and the next year R. Kenneth Fairman '34, later director of athletics, was named Ail-American. The 1942 Princeton team tied for first place but lost the play-off to Dart\u00ad mouth. Its defensive leader was Dewey Bartlett '42, later governor of Okla\u00ad homa; its leader in rebounding, Bud Palmer '44, who became captain of the New York Knickerbockers in their early years and later New York's Public Events Commissioner and a radio and television announcer. THE FIFTIES In the fifties Princeton had the edge in a continuing struggle with Dart\u00ad mouth: each won the championship three times, but Princeton was more often second. Princeton took the title outright in 1950 and 1952 and won it in 1955 in the play-off of a triple tie with Columbia and Penn. That year's cap\u00ad tain, Harold F. Haabestad, Jr. '55, who was selected for the all-Ivy team in his senior year, became the first Prince- tonian to score more than 1,000 points in his career, with a three-year total of 1292. Princeton tied for first place two other times but lost the play-offs, in 1954 to Cornell and in 1959 to Dartmouth, both times as a result of BASKETBALL 43 baskets scored by the opponents as the final buzzer sounded. In 1959 the same five players\u2014the BeIz brothers, Carl and Herm, Jim Brangan, Joe Burns, and Artie Klein\u2014started every game for Princeton, setting an Ivy League re\u00ad cord for durability. Carl BeIz, who was captain, was twice all-Ivy. The winning teams of the fifties were produced by Franklin C. Cappon, Uni\u00ad versity of Michigan 1924 and an honor\u00ad ary member of the Princeton Class of 1924. He had become coach in 1939 and, except for the war years, carried on until he died of a heart attack in the Dillon gym locker room after a practice session with his team in November 1961. Frank Deford '61 gave this graphic and affecting word-picture of Cappon in the Alumni Weekly: In a profession in which men are re\u00ad nowned for their behaviour during a basketball game, Cappy Cappon stood quite by himself among coaches. Until the game was over, the man never did anything but frown. There were degrees of frown\u00ad ing, of course, but his gamut of ex\u00ad pression seldom ventured too far from that of a basic frown. A mourn\u00ad ful frown, a disinterested frown, and if it was possible\u2014and it was\u2014a frown of satisfaction. . . . And when something happened that there wasn't a frown to express completely, Cappy would cup his hands or rise to his feet and bellow the words: \"What- 'rya doin' out there?\" When the game was over, the frown would stay quite in place if Princeton lost. But if they won, he would finally smile just a bit, a smile that looked both modest and embarrassed. . . . As a teacher, he was recognized not only for his record, but for his perfection of the weave offense, and for substituting but rarely. \"If you start five men, they should be your best men, and if they're in shape, and play the way they should, there should be no need to substitute,\" he said once. He paused and added, \"but more important than all that, I haven't got anybody worth a damn on the bench.\" THE SIXTIES In the sixties Princeton won seven ti\u00ad tles (1960, 1961, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1967, and 1969), lost the play-off for an eighth one (1968), and finished in the first division the other two seasons (1962 and 1966). Four coaches took part in this achievement. Cappon got things off to a good start and Jake L. McCand- less '51 carried on in 1961 and 1962. Willem van Breda Kolff '45, one of Cappon's players and one of Palmer's teammates on the Knicks, served from 1963 through 1967; he was named coach-of-the-year in 1965. Peter J. Car- ril took over in 1968. Jim Brangan, the 1960 captain who was twice all-Ivy, delighted the Prince\u00ad ton fans with his good shooting, his ag\u00ad gressive defense and his smart play generally. When Cappy took him out two minutes before the end of his last game, the crowd gave him a five- minute standing ovation. High scorer in the early sixties was Pete Campbell '62, who broke Haabe- stad's 1955 record with a career total of 1451 points. Campbell was all-Ivy three times; his classmate Al Kaemmerlen, an outstanding rebounder and captain in 1962, was all-Ivy twice. In 1963, 1964 and 1965, Princeton at\u00ad tained the highest level of excellence it had ever known, winning three succes\u00ad sive league championships for the first time in its history. This achievement 44 BASKETBALL was due primarily to the performance of Bill Bradley '65, a complete and ded\u00ad icated player, who not only provided a classic example of team play but led the league in scoring all three varsity years. As a freshman Bradley sank 57 suc\u00ad cessive free throws, a record un\u00ad matched by any other player, college or professional. As a sophomore he led the league in rebounds, field goals, free throws, and total points, and, when he fouled out after scoring a record- breaking 40 points in an NCAA tour\u00ad nament game with St. Joseph's in Philadelphia, was given an unprece\u00ad dented ovation. In his junior year he made 51 points against Harvard, more than the entire opposing team had scored before he was taken out, and his 33.1 points-per- game average that season set an Ivy League record. In the summer of 1964 Bradley was the youngest member, and the captain, of the gold-medal winning United States basketball team at the Olympics in Tokyo. In his senior year, when he was cap\u00ad tain, he led Princeton to the highest na\u00ad tional ranking it had ever had in bas\u00ad ketball. It placed third behind UCLA and Michigan in the NCAA tournament as a result of an 118-82 victory over the University of Wichita in the consolation game of the semi-finals.* In the Wichita game Bradley scored 58 points, an NCAA tournament record. Bradley's career total of 2503 points ranked third after the collegiate record of 2973 Oscar Robertson set at the Uni\u00ad versity of Cincinnati in the late fifties and the 2538 Frank Selvy scored at Furman in the middle fifties. He was a unanimous all-Ivy selection in 1963, 1964, and 1965; Art Hyland, captain in 1963, was the only other Princetonian named all-Ivy during this era. Bradley was named All-American all three years and shared with Gail Goodrich of UCLA the player-of-the-year honors in 1965. That year he was selected as the winner of the Sullivan Award as the amateur athlete \"who did the most to advance the cause of good sportsman\u00ad ship during the year.\" He was the first basketball player ever to win this award, and the second Princetonian (Bill Bonthron '34, the miler, won it in 1934). Best known of the extensive writing about Bradley while he was at Princeton was John McPhee '53's New Yorker profile, later published in ex\u00ad panded form as a book, A Sense of Where You Are. After graduating from Princeton, Bradley was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford for two years. He then joined the New York Knickerbockers and contributed to their winning of the N. B. A. cham\u00ad pionship in 1970 and 1973. The 1967 team compiled a 25-3 won-lost record\u2014Princeton's best since 1925. This team set a league record for the largest number of points (116) made in one game\u2014against Dartmouth (42) at Hanover. It set another record when it provided three-fifths of the annual all-Ivy team (Gary Walters '67, Joe Heiser '68, Chris Thomforde '69), as did the 1968 team (Heiser, Thomforde, and Geoff Petrie '70), occurrences un\u00ad precedented since these selections by Ivy League coaches were begun in 1954. In 1968, Heiser, then captain, sank 91.8 percent of his free throws, which made him the best college foul shooter in the country that year. The 1969 team, in Coach Carril's words, \"was born of adversity and in\u00ad dignities.\" Early in the season it was frustrated by Villanova, embarrassed by Duke, and humiliated by UCLA and North Carolina. It then went on to do what a Princeton team had never done BASKETBALL 45 before: it won all fourteen league games, the first time any Ivy team had gone undefeated in league competition since 1951. The three front-court men, Captain Chris Thomforde '69, center, and Geoff Petrie '70 and John Hummer '70, forwards, all twice all-Ivy selec\u00ad tions, were outstanding. Petrie and Hummer, co-captains in 1970, followed Bradley into professional basketball. Petrie who was N. B.A. co-rookie-of- the-year in 1971, became a top scorer for Portland. Hummer played for Buf\u00ad falo, Chicago, and Seattle. THE SEVENTIES Penn resumed its domination of the Ivy League in the early seventies, win\u00ad ning six championships through 1975. Princeton became stronger as the dec\u00ad ade advanced, placing third in 1970 and 1971, second in the next four successive years, and first in 1976 and 1977. Brian Taylor was a principal factor in the success of the 1972 team, which missed tying Penn for the cham\u00ad pionship only by losing a two-point upset to Dartmouth. All-Ivy in 1971 and 1972, All-American in 1972, and the only Princeton player after Bradley to score 1,000 points in two years of Varsity play, Taylor left college at the end of his junior year to accept a con\u00ad tract with the New York Nets. He was A. B. A. rookie-of-the-year in 1973 and later played with the Kansas City Kings and the Denver Nuggets. The Princeton team of 1973, led by Captain Ted Manakas, ranked third in defense nationally. Manakas was a unanimous choice for the All-Ivy team and later played for Kansas City-Omaha in the National Basketball Association. In 1974, Princeton ranked among the top five college teams nationally both in defense and free-throw shooting. The captain and center, Andy Rimol, was drafted on graduation, by the Buffalo Braves. Although the 1975 team finished sec\u00ad ond to Penn in the Ivy League with a 12-2 record, it swept its final thirteen games for the longest major college winning streak that year, and the last four victories in Madison Square Gar\u00ad den (over Holy Cross, South Carolina, Oregon, and Providence) gave Prince\u00ad ton a stunning championship in the Na\u00ad tional Invitation Tournament and twelfth place in the final Associated Press national rankings. The cham\u00ad pionship was the first ever won by an Ivy team in any postseason basketball tournament. Reporters called the Princeton team \"patient,\" \"smart,\" and \"poised,\" observing that it \"combined a probing offense with an aggressive man-to-man defense.\" Starting guards Armond Hill and Mickey Steurer won special recognition, Hill as all-Ivy, Steurer as a member of a twelve-man squad selected by the Eastern College Athletic Conference. The 1976 team, co-captained, like its predecessor, by Armond Hill and Mickey Steurer, won the Ivy title 14-0 and finished the season impressively 22-5 overall. Two of its members were drafted by professional teams, Armond Hill, a unanimous all-Ivy selection, by the Atlanta Hawks, and Barnes Haupt- fuhrer by the Houston Rockets. In 1977, Princeton retained the Ivy League title 13-1, while posting a 21-4 record over-all. Frank Sowinski '78, who led the league with a .767 field goal shooting percentage, was a unani\u00ad mous All-Ivy selection and had the added distinction of being named Ivy League basketball player of the year. Both the 1976 and the 1977 teams led the nation in defense and were also noted for the way they moved the ball around, patiently waiting for the open 46 SAMUEL BAYARD man and the good shot\u2014hallmarks of Pete Carril's coaching. Other coaches frequently said his teams gave clinical demonstrations of how basketball should be played. Playing Princeton, one of them declared, was like going to the dentist\u2014\"It's painful, but it does you a lot of good.\" The 1978 season brought Princeton a tie for second place in the Ivy League, All-Ivy selection for both co-captains, Frank Sowinski and Bill Omeltchenko, Pete Carril's eleventh winning season in as many years at Princeton, and a book by Dan White '65 called Pfoy To Win: A Profile of Princeton Basketball Coach Pete Carril. WOMEN'S BASKETBALL Coached by Penelope Hinckley and later by Pat Walsh, the women's bas\u00ad ketball team, first organized in 1971, has been increasingly successful in in\u00ad tercollegiate competition, gaining four straight Ivy championships in 1975, 1976, 1977, and 1978. In 1976 Prince\u00ad ton won the AIAW Eastern Small Col\u00ad lege Tournament, and in 1978, it placed two women on the Ivy all-tour\u00ad nament team\u2014Margaret Meier '78 and C. B. Tomasewicz '79, who was also voted the tournament's most valuable player. The development of a tight one-on-one defensive style contributed to the women's continuing success, which brought growing University community interest and support. * Princeton was eliminated in the first round of the NCAA tournament in 1952, I960, 1963, 1969, 1976, and 1977; in the second round in 1955 1961, 1964, and 1967. Bayard, Samuel (1767-1840), a Philadelphian of Huguenot ancestry, was valedictorian of the Class of 1784 at the age of seventeen. He became well known in the law and in public service\u2014as clerk of the United States Supreme Court, prosecutor of United States claims before the British ad\u00ad miralty courts, presiding judge of Westchester County\u2014and when he was forty returned to live in Princeton. He became the first mayor of the borough, and was for a time presiding judge of the court of common pleas of Somerset County and a member of the state assembly. At different times he served the College as librarian, trustee, and treasurer; he was a founder and a trustee of the Seminary. The street on which he lived was named Bayard Lane in his honor. Bedford, Paul (1875-1967) came to Princeton to see his first commence\u00ad ment when he was a boy of sixteen still undecided about where to go to col\u00ad lege. He accompanied the pastor of his church in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Francis B. Hodge 1859, who was a Princeton trustee. Bedford liked to re\u00ad call that, soon after their arrival, he met \"a spinster lady of Victorian virtues,\" who cautioned him about the behavior of alumni at their reunions. Thus alerted, he watched very carefully, and the more he saw of \"alumni jubila\u00ad tion,\" he said, the more he envied the alumni. \"Their companionship and their loyalty to class and college\" so im\u00ad pressed him that he thereupon deter\u00ad mined to go to Princeton instead of Yale. Two years later, in 1893, he entered Princeton and here, in the middle of the Golden Nineties, discovered inter\u00ad ests and developed tastes that he culti\u00ad vated all his life: good food and drink, friendships, athletics, music, history and politics\u2014the last enlivened by Woodrow Wilson's brilliant lectures. After graduating from Princeton in 1897 and from the University of Penn\u00ad sylvania Law School in 1900, Bedford PAUL BEDFORD 47 returned to Wilkes-Barre and joined his father in the practice of law. He be\u00ad came a leader in his profession and in civic affairs, president of the trustees of Dr. Hodges old church, an active WiI- sonian Democrat, and\u2014in the opinion of many\u2014the first citizen of the com\u00ad munity. Bedford was elected an alumni trus\u00ad tee in 1930, a charter trustee in 1934, and, after his retirement in 1946, served as trustee emeritus until his death in 1967, at the age of ninety-two. He was chairman of the trustee com\u00ad mittee that raised funds for the building of Firestone Library and founder of the Friends of Music at Princeton, its hon\u00ad orary chairman and one of its most faithful and generous supporters. A de\u00ad voted follower of football and baseball, he was for many years one of the two trustee representatives on the Univer\u00ad sity Council on Athletics; in 1934 he donated the funds for Bedford Field, which is used for intramural athletics. Bedford was chairman of the com\u00ad mencement committee from 1941 through 1967. Every spring he enter\u00ad tained the committee at a dinner at the Princeton Inn which he took delight in planning and which, in its sumptuous detail, was reminiscent of the Golden Nineties: cocktails and caviar; fresh fruit; terrapin soup laced with sherry; shad with roe, and new asparagus with Hollandaise sauce, accompanied by Bedford's favorite wine, a choice Moselle called Bernkasteler Doktor und-graben; salad; ices and cakes with champagne; coffee; liqueur, and cigars. During the twenty-seven years that Bedford was chairman, his was the most sought-after committee in the University; its membership increased from five to twenty and no one ever re\u00ad signed. His annual report on commencement was a highlight of the October meeting of the Board of Trustees. He expatiated eloquently on such topics as the \"de- gustation of food and beverages,\" the skill of the faculty marshals in getting the procession to move \"with celerity uncontempered by cunctation,\" and the vagaries of the weather. After the 1959 commencement he was able to report an unbroken record of twenty- five successive outdoor commence\u00ad ments, an achievement he thought only fitting for a university with the motto Dei sub numine viget, though he always credited any favorable weather to the committee's efforts. In his reports, Bedford always had a kind word for alumni reunions\u2014those times of jubilation that \"the spinster lady of Victorian virtue\" had first called to his attention years before. He con\u00ad sidered them \"the core and kernel of Princeton's widespread loyalty,\" from which stems \"active alumni support for every Princeton cause.\" Bedford him\u00ad self was able to celebrate his seventieth reunion with one other classmate. At the Commencement exercises in 1965, nine days before Bedford's ninetieth birthday, President Goheen read this tribute: As gay at heart, as young in spirit today as he was at his own Com\u00ad mencement in 1897, he has graced the meetings of the Board of Trustees for thirty-five years, delighting them with his humor, impressing them with his wisdom. Like Falstaff, he is not only witty in himself, but the cause of wit in other men. To the city of his birth, Wilkes-Barre, he has de\u00ad voted his professional life and his noble instincts for charity and social work; to his alma mater he has given decades of cheerful service and lead\u00ad ership, and each loyalty has served to enrich the other. . . . The past six presidents of Princeton have been 48 BEER JACKETS entertained at his hospitable family home in Wilkes-Barre, and the last three have been richer for his sympa\u00ad thetic friendship extended over his own gourmet board. He is a man who, as Dr. Johnson said, keeps his friendships in repair. As chairman of the committee for raising the funds for Firestone Library, and as peren\u00ad nial godfather of the Department of Music, he has unwittingly reared his own best tributes from this Univer\u00ad sity. Today we honor in affection and gratitude the Chairman of the Com\u00ad mencement Committee for the past twenty-five years, that Prince of Princetonians, Paul Bedford of the Class of 1897. Beer jackets of white denim, with a dis\u00ad tinctive design imprinted on the back, have been worn by undergraduates in the spring of their senior year during the greater part of this century. The practice was started by a small group in the Class of 1912 who, while quaffing beer and carving their initials on the tables of the old Nassau Inn, noticed that the foam from their steins some\u00ad times spotted their clothes. In order to avoid dry-cleaning bills, they adopted the blue denim overalls and jackets of workmen. The next year, with the first signs of spring, the whole Class of 1913 donned overalls and jackets, this time white, and, although they were more a means of class identification than drink\u00ad ing uniforms, called them beer suits. Beer suits disappeared during World War I but were revived in 1919, partly in protest against high clothing prices. The Class of 1920 were the first to use a design; they wore black arm bands to mourn the passing of John Bar\u00ad leycorn. Other classes also recorded the effects of Prohibition on the backs of their beer jackets, 1922 by a beer mug with wings, 1923 with a tiger pur\u00ad sued by a camel. The Class of 1925 de\u00ad picted a tiger crushed by four heavy tomes, in token of the burden imposed on them by the new Four Course Plan. The Class of 1930's design, \"a perfect bust,\" was prompted by several seniors' purloining a copy of Venus de MiIo from McCormick Hall, but it was also interpreted by some as commemorat\u00ad ing the 1929 stock market crash. The Class of 1934 celebrated the contribu\u00ad tion it had made to Princeton's unde\u00ad feated football season of 1933 in the context of the National Recovery Act of that same year by portraying the NRA initials and legend \"We did our part.\" The Class of 1941, graduating during World War II, pictured a helmeted tiger sitting on a bomb-shaped world with a burning fuse. After the war, overalls were dispensed with, and since then only jackets have been worn. In the fifties and sixties less attention was paid to symbolizing events of senior year and more to rearranging what came to be regarded as basic ele\u00ad ments of beer jacket design: tigers, beer, girls. The Class of 1962's \"the lady and the tiger\" made effective use of the numerals 62 for the essential curves of the lady, while the Class of 1963's \"astrotiger\" rode in a space cap\u00ad sule, a foaming mug in one paw. A once-in-a-century opportunity was exploited by the Class of 1964\u2014a tiger behind a ball marked with V64T Beggs, George Erie (1883-1939), Pro\u00ad fessor of Civil Engineering, was inter\u00ad nationally known for his invention of a means of predetermining the stress re\u00ad sistance of bridges, dams, and similar structures. This method, which in\u00ad volved making celluloid scale models^ placing test weights on them, and measuring the strains with instruments JONATHAN BELCHER 49 he devised, was used by him when a consultant for the Arlington Memorial Bridge, the Stevenson Creek Dam, the San Francisco-Oakland Bridge, and the towers of the Golden Gate Bridge. The Beggs deformeter gauges have been used by engineers throughout the world for the solution of problems relat\u00ad ing to indeterminate structures. Beggs was born in Ashland, Illinois; he earned his A. B. from Northwestern University in 1905, and a civil en\u00ad gineering degree, with highest honors, from Columbia University in 1910. He joined the Princeton faculty as instruc\u00ad tor in 1914, became a full professor in 1930, and chairman of the Department of Civil Engineering in 1937. He was also chairman of the Engineering Foundation, a cooperative arm of the several national engineering societies organized for the furtherance of re\u00ad search. His students admired him for the thoroughness and clarity of his teach\u00ad ing, and his colleagues for the active part he took in the life of the University and in the engineering profession. Beggs Hall, one of the six units of the Engineering Quadrangle, built in 1962, is named for him. Belcher, Jonathan (1681/2-1757), gov\u00ad ernor of the Province of New Jersey from 1747 to 1757, granted Princeton its second charter and helped its ad\u00ad vancement in many other ways; the College, his fellow trustees declared in 1755, viewed him as \"its founder, pa\u00ad tron, and benefactor.\" A native of Cambridge, Massachu\u00ad setts, he graduated from Harvard in 1699, second in a class of twelve, accumulated a fortune at an early age as a merchant in Boston, and then oc\u00ad cupied himself with a succession of public offices: tithingman and town ac\u00ad countant of Boston, member of the Massachusetts Council, governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and finally, during the last decade of his life\u2014to quote from his commission, which is preserved in the University Library\u2014\"Captain General and Gov- ernor-in-Chief of the Province of New Jersey and territories thereupon de\u00ad pending in America, and Vice-Admiral of the same.\" Belcher had a quick temper and a sharp tongue, which aggravated the troubles that every royal governor faced in reconciling colonial interests with those of the Crown, and earned for him many enemies in Massachusetts and New Hampshire whose intrigues brought about his dismissal in 1741. He was, however, able to convince the English court that he had been ma\u00ad ligned by his political enemies, and after living in England for several years he was appointed to the New Jersey governorship. Soon after his arrival in New Jersey in 1747, Belcher, a Congregationalist, adopted the infant college of the dis\u00ad senting Presbyterians as his own and busied himself in its promotion for \"better enlightening the minds and polishing the manners of this and neighboring colonies.\" Finding the legality of the College's original charter under attack\u2014it had been granted by Acting Governor John Hamilton, whose authority was questioned\u2014 Belcher granted a second one on Sep\u00ad tember 14, 1748. The charter provided for twenty-three, rather than twelve, trustees, thus permitting the governing board to broaden and strengthen its representation politically and reli\u00ad giously (see article on Charter). Eight weeks later at the College's first com\u00ad mencement, the trustees conferred on 50 BENDER Belcher Princeton's first honorary de\u00ad gree. Belcher encouraged the trustees to raise funds for a college building and a house for the president and, in the dis\u00ad pute as to where the College was to be settled, threw his influence in favor of Princeton\u2014\"as near the center of the Province as any and a fine situation.\" Just before the College moved from Newark to Princeton Belcher gave the trustees his library of 474 volumes, his full-length portrait, his carved and gilded coat-of-arms, a pair of terrestrial globes, and ten framed portraits of kings and queens of England. In their address of thanks the trustees asked his permission to name the first building, then being erected in Princeton, Belcher Hall. Modestly\u2014and providen\u00ad tially\u2014the governor declined this honor and persuaded them to name it Nassau Hall for \"the glorious King Wil\u00ad liam the Third . . . of the illustrious House of Nassau,\" who was held in high regard by dissenters as a champion of religious freedom and political lib\u00ad erty. Although only six of Belcher's books have survived, he is still held in honor as the library's oldest benefactor: when Firestone Library was built in 1948, the governor's arms were carved in stone over the main entrance along with those of the University. His portrait and those of the ten English monarchs were destroyed during the Revolution. The portrait of Belcher that now hangs in Nassau Hall was obtained from an English descendant of the governor and presented to the University in 1953 by Carl Otto von Kienbusch '06. Bender, Harold H. (1882-1951), M. Taylor Pyne Professor of Indo- Germanic Philology and first chairman of the Department of Oriential Lan\u00adguages and Literatures, spent all forty-one years of his versatile and pro\u00ad ductive career at Princeton. After receiving his Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins and pursuing further study at the University of Berlin, he joined the faculty in 1909. He began teaching German to freshmen and sophomores, and soon was teaching Gothic, Old Norse, Sanskrit, Lithuanian, and his famous course in linguistic science to graduate students. A specialist in Lithuanian philology, he demonstrated in one of his major publications the relationship between Lithuanian and other Indo-European languages. In another important book he located the original home of the Indo-Europeans in eastern central Europe. As chief etymologist for Web\u00ad ster's New International Dictionary, with the assistance of seventy other scholars he revised the etymologies of over half a million words. This monu\u00ad mental achievement brought him worldwide recognition as an authority on the etymology of the English lan\u00ad guage. Bender was a founder of the Linguis\u00ad tic Society of America and president of the American Oriental Society. He was an honorary doctor of philology of the University of Lithuania, and was deco\u00ad rated by Lithuania for his assistance during her struggle for independence. An amateur criminologist, he gave the state police expert help in their in\u00ad vestigation of the Lindbergh kidnap\u00ad ping and other cases. His colleagues thought that, for him, tracking down criminals was as interesting as \"tracing the origin of obscure words to some remote corner of the world or dim pe\u00ad riod of antiquity.\" He conducted most of his classes and did most of his research at home, and when it was necessary for him to come THE BICENTENNIAL 51 to the campus he usually came by taxi. He was a tireless worker with an amaz\u00ad ing capacity for concentrated work. It was not unusual for passers-by to ob\u00ad serve the light in his study at 120 Fitz- Randolph Road burning long after midnight. His colleagues praised him for his critical insight and his acumen and what, they said, was an even rarer qual\u00ad ity, his creative imagination. \"His own joy in what he was doing, and his con\u00ad viction of its importance, were conta\u00ad gious. To numberless students, he was an unsurpassed example of the teacher-scholar.\" Bicentennial, The, of Princeton's founding on October 22, 1746, was cele\u00ad brated in a year-long series of events in 1946-1947. The \"concatenation,\" as Professor Charles G. Osgood called it in his book on the celebration, began in September with a sermon in the Chapel by the Archbishop of Canter\u00ad bury and ended with an address by President Truman in front of Nassau Hall at the concluding convocation in June. Inten'ening were three other convocations, and in between these \"gaudy days\" were sixteen conferences of scholars and men of affairs, brought together to help recover some of the momentum that had been lost during the war years and to try to chart what lay ahead. President Dodds made three major addresses at the convocations in Octo\u00ad ber, February, and June. During the course of the year, he also conferred honorary degrees on some hundred eminent persons, including Niels Bohr, John von Neumann, Arnold J. Toyn- Salvador Jacques Maritain, Trygvie Lie, General Dwight Eisenhower, Sec\u00adretary of State George Marshall, and President Truman. The chief designer of the Bicenten\u00ad nial Conferences was Dean J. Douglas Brown, who directed a series of confer\u00ad ences in the fall; Professor Whitney J. Oates directed a series in the winter and spring. Most of the conferences were led by Princeton professors and were concerned with broad topics in their several fields of scholarship, e.g., \"The Future of Nuclear Science,\" Eugene P. Wigner; \"The Humanistic Tradition in the Century Ahead,\" Donald A. Stauffer; \"The University and Its World Responsibilities,\" Gor\u00ad don A. Craig and Cyril E. Black. The conferences were attended by scholars and men and women of affairs from all parts of the world. The October convocation, com\u00ad memorating Charter Day, began with an academic procession from Nassau Hall to the Chapel; the undergraduate band, grouped about the Cannon, played as an accompaniment a hitherto unperformed march by Beethoven. At the exercises the choir and the glee club sang an anthem, \"Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,\" composed espe\u00ad cially for the occasion by Professor Ed\u00ad ward T. Cone. The February convocation was held in the Chapel on Washington's Birth\u00ad day, even more snowbound than usual in the late Princeton winter. At the luncheon that followed, alumni and guests heard Secretary of State George C. Marshall make his first address since taking office. The Bicentennial Year reached its climax with a brilliant series of events during the days from June 14 to 17. These included: on Saturday, the dedi\u00ad cation of the new Dillon Gymnasium and a musical review of Princeton his\u00ad tory, narrated by Jose Ferrer '33; on 52 BICENTENNIAL PRECEFTORSHIPS Sunday, a service of remembrance in the Chapel and a festival concert by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, led by Serge Koussevitslcy; on Monday, a serv\u00ad ice of dedication, the laying of the cor\u00ad nerstone of Firestone Library, a formal reception of visiting delegates, a garden party at the Graduate College, and a dinner for 1,700 guests; and on Tues\u00ad day, the final convocation of the cele\u00ad bration. At the convocation, an audience of five thousand persons seated in front of Nassau Hall watched an academic procession that included such celeb\u00ad rities as President Truman, former President Hoover, General Eisen\u00ad Field Marshall Viscount Alex\u00ad ander of of Canada), Admiral Nimitz, Chief Jus\u00ad tice Vinson, Judge Learned Hand, Governor Driscoll, Albert Einstein, Eugene Cardinal Tisserant, T. S. Eliot, and Serge Koussevitslcy. The proces\u00ad sion was swollen to a thousand persons by delegates from universities and col\u00ad leges in all parts of the United States and in forty-three foreign countries. They walked in the order of the found\u00ad ing of their universities beginning with twelfth-century Salamanca and thir\u00ad teenth-century Paris, Oxford, Cam\u00ad bridge and Toulouse, and ending with several American colleges established in the 1940s. Their presence, President Dodds told them at the reception of delegates on the preceding day, was \"more than a gracious gesture of friend\u00ad ship\"; it was an indication \"of the comity of purpose that makes scholars every\u00ad where citizens of one world-wide com\u00ad monwealth.\" President Truman said the need for educated people in public life, which Grover Cleveland had stressed at Princeton's Sesquicentennial fifty years before, was now greater than ever, and in this connection praised the program of the Woodrow Wilson School. The guiding spirit in the develop\u00ad ment of the Bicentennial Year was Wal\u00ad ter E. Hope Ol, chairman of the execu\u00ad tive committee of the trustees and of the executive committee for the Bicen\u00ad tennial. Serving as chief marshal at the various convocations was Chauncey Belknap 12, clerk of the Board of Trus\u00ad tees. The chief organizer and coor\u00ad dinator was Arthur E. Fox 13, assistant to the president, secretary of the Bicen\u00ad tennial executive committee. Colonel Fox left a file of Bicentennial proce\u00ad dures and methods, \"complete to the most minute detail,\" in the University archives. There it awaits his successor in 1996. Bicentennial Preceptorships, which were conceived soon after the Univer\u00ad sity's two hundredth anniversary in 1946-1947, were first awarded in 1950. Their purpose is to recognize young faculty members of high promise and to encourage the development of their teaching capacity and scholarship. Each award is made for a period of three years and provides a year's leave of ab\u00ad sence at full salary for scholarly work, along with an allowance for research expenses. Ten preceptorships were endowed with gifts from the Classes of 1931 and 1936 and bequests from Philip Rollins 1889 and Beulah Rollins, Arthur H. Scribner 1881, Mrs. Helen Annan Scribner, and Ferris Thompson 1888; others are supported through Annual Giving. Bicycle Racing on Princeton University grounds began in 1879. A year later, during the first running of the Intercol\u00ad legiate Games, Princeton won the two-mile event, and won again in 1900 BIG THREE 53 when the competition was held under the auspices of an independent Inter\u00ad collegiate Bicycle Association. Prince\u00ad ton's best known rider in the early days was Bert Ripley Ol, famous for his \"scaled cat sprint\" (back arched, shoul\u00ad ders low) and the winner of hundreds of races, including the five-mile compe\u00ad tition at the 1898 Intercollegiate Games. Although the 1890s may have been the period of most intense cycling activ\u00ad ity, the 1960s saw a dramatic renais\u00ad sance, with Princeton winning five con\u00ad secutive National Intercollegiate Cham\u00ad pionships between 1961 and 1966. Among the leading riders on these championship teams were Leif Thome 1976 Princeton cyclists departed from one long-held tradition when they admitted women to the team. Frank J. Quinn Dick Swann Big Three was the name given Har\u00ad vard, Yale, and Princeton in the days when they settled \"between them,\" as the New York Times once put it, \"the question of primacy in football,\" and overwhelmed their other opponents in the process. At a time when games were ninety minutes long, as against today's sixty minutes, and schedules were also somewhat longer, Princeton rolled up a season's score of 637 to 25 in 1885; Harvard dominated by a record margin of 765 to 41 in 1886; and Yale shut out everybody, 698 to 0, in 1888. Huge totals like these reflected single- game landslides over smaller colleges (e.g., Yale 142, Wesleyan 0; Princeton 140, Lafayette 0; Harvard 102, Amherst 0), but they included substantial vic\u00ad tories over colleges of approximately equal size (e.g., Princeton 82, Rutgers 0; Harvard 77, Cornell 0; Yale 64, Michigan 0). These scores were made before foot\u00ad ball had spread to the West and the South, with the help of Big Three foot\u00ad ball stars who went out in the 1890s and early 1900s to coach at such colleges as Chicago, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Purdue, California, Stanford, North Carolina, Virgina, and Vanderbilt. There were many from Princeton and even more from Yale\u2014eight members of Yale's famous 1888 team became coaches. The Big Three dominated football for half a century, until 1919. Princeton football historian Donald Grant Her\u00ad ring '07 said that November 1 of that year marked \"the beginning of the end\" of their reign. That was the Saturday that previously unheralded West Vir\u00ad ginia beat a very good Princeton team 25 to 0. The decline was further evi\u00ad denced in 1921 when Centre College of Kentucky, whose student body num\u00ad bered 264, upset Harvard 6 to 0, and again in 1922 when the University of Iowa, playing its first intersectional game, defeated Yale 6 to 0. Although originally drawn together by their mutual interests, the Big Three have had their differences among themselves. The only unbroken football relationship among them is the one be\u00ad tween Princeton and Yale which dates from 1873. Harvard and Yale, who first played each other in 1875, sustained a two-year break in the 1890s when Har\u00ad vard dropped Yale from its schedule. The Harvard-Princeton series, which began in 1877, was interrupted on Har\u00ad vard's initiative for almost all of the two decades from 1890 through 1910, and on Princeton's from 1926 through 1933; both interruptions began during peri\u00ad ods of especially intense rivalry when feelings ran high, and there were 54 BIOCHEMICAL SCIENCES charges and countercharges of-exces\u00ad sive zeal on and off the field. But these football breaks did not preclude friendly gestures in other areas. Soon after the 1926 break, Arthur Sachs (Harvard 1901) made a handsome gift to Princeton and Harvard to support the publication of Art Studies (which was jointly edited by their art depart\u00ad ments), wishing thus, he said, to stress Harvard and Princeton's friendly rela\u00ad tions in terms of cooperative scholar\u00ad ship at a time when their \"desirable\" relations in athletics had become \"over\u00ad emphasized.\" As early as 1916, the Big Three had attempted to counteract this \"overem\u00ad phasis.\" That year, in an effort to keep \"the. spirit and the associations of pro\u00ad fessionalism out of college sports,\" the presidents of the three universities adopted a statement of principles set\u00ad ting common standards for athletic eligibility both as to scholastic standing and financial aid. A supplementary agreement, adopted in 1922, reduced the length of football schedules and out\u00ad lawed spring practice and postseason games. Except for the years of the last Harvard-Princeton break, when there were dual agreements between Yale and Harvard and Yale and Princeton, the Harvard-Yale-Princeton agreement continued in effect until 1945, when the three universities entered into a similar arrangement with the other members of what became the Ivy League (q.v.). Over the years the Big Three con\u00ad cept spread to other sports, from baseball to wrestling, and even after the organization of the Ivy League, re\u00ad tained some of its original influence. In 150-pound rowing, Harvard, Yale, and Princeton crews have since 1922 annu\u00ad ally competed for the Goldthwait Cup, and there have been special Big Three meets in cross-country. With coeduca\u00ad tion, the Big Three idea has taken hold in a number of women's sports, includ\u00ad ing field hockey, whose Princeton adherents proudly celebrated their third successive Big Three cham\u00ad pionship in 1975. Biochemical Sciences at Princeton had their official beginning in 1961 when a Program in Biochemical Sciences was initiated. Courses in this field had pre\u00ad viously been given by the Biology De\u00ad partment for many years. In fact, in the 1920s E. Newton Harvey gave one of the earliest undergraduate biochemis\u00ad try courses in this country. Other biochemically oriented courses were presented during the intervening forty years, particularly by Aurin M. Chase. The need for a more chemically oriented sort of biology became appar\u00ad ent to the University during the 1950s, as the spectacular successes of bio\u00ad chemistry and molecular biology in explaining life's mysteries achieved general acknowledgment. A committee of biology and chemistry faculty mem\u00ad bers formulated a plan for bringing biochemists to Princeton, to be mem\u00ad bers of either department and to be housed in the new Moffett Laboratory and in Frick Chemical Laboratory. The first appointees were Jacques R. Fresco in 1960 (chemistry) and Arthur B. Par\u00ad dee in 1961 (biology), a member of the Princeton faculty until 1975, when he accepted appointment as professor in the Sidney Farber Cancer Institute of the Harvard Medical School. The program has grown in numbers of both faculty and students; in 1974 there were about 12 faculty, and a student-faculty ratio considerably above the University average. Teaching has also been stressed at the graduate level; research and work with postdoc-BIOLOGY 55 toral fellows has been extensive, with grants for sponsored research amount\u00ad ing to $1.4 million. Noteworthy events in the growth of the program were the construction in 1964 of a new wing of Frick Laboratory\u2014half for biochemical sciences\u2014and the achievement of de\u00ad partmental status in 1970. Chairmen have been Arthur B. Pardee (1961- 1967), Charles Gilvarg (1967-1973), Bruce M. Alberts (1973-1974), and Jacques R. Fresco (1974- ). In 1977, work was started on the con\u00ad struction of a new building (on William Street, adjacent to Frick) designed not only to provide much needed addi\u00ad tional space and modern biochemical laboratories but also to permit the con\u00ad solidation of all of the department's ac\u00ad tivities. Arthur B. Pardee Biology at Princeton goes back to 1830 when the great American botanist John Torrey (q.v.) accepted a part-time fac\u00ad ulty appointment and began giving courses in botany to the under\u00ad graduates. Following Torrey, various professors from other disciplines (for instance, a professor of German and Italian) gave lectures in botany and zoology. However, it was not until the formation of the School of Science in the 1870s that Princeton had a full-time biologist on the faculty. President McCosh first attempted to obtain Theodore Gill, a leading zoologist, from the Smithsonian Institution, but much to the president's embarrassment the trustees turned the appointment down because Dr. Gill was a Darwinian. After some further searching, the trus\u00ad tees enthusiastically approved the pres\u00ad ident's calling the Reverend George Macloskie from Ireland to become the Professor of Natural History at Prince\u00ad ton. Professor Macloskie was an ama\u00adteur naturalist with degrees in divinity and law. Many years later, he told his distinguished successor, Edwin Grant Conklin (q.v.), in what Dr. Conklin termed a \"humorous confession,\" that he accepted because he \"wanted to see America for a few years and thought he might learn enough natural history on the way over to keep ahead of the boys.\" In fact he was a splendid teacher and wrote a textbook of elementary botany in 1883. Furthermore, he con\u00ad tributed some important parts on plants to the highly respected Reports of the Princeton Expedition to Patagonia. He was, of course, not a Darwinian and be\u00ad lieved in what was called theistic evolu\u00ad tion. He is perhaps best known for his spirited attempt to interpret the Bible in terms of modern science, in which he suggested, among other things, that Jonah could not have resided in the whale's stomach; he must have been in the laryngeal chamber. The first stirrings at Princeton of biology as we know it today came from geology and paleontology. The famous geologist Arnold Guyot had a number of brilliant students, three of whom in particular straddled biology, paleontol\u00ad ogy, and geology. They were Henry Fairfield Osborn, William Berryman Scott, and William Libbey Jr. All three graduated from the college in 1877. The first two studied abroad in a number of laboratories, including that of Thomas Henry Huxley in London. Huxley was a most vigorous proponent of a unified science of life, i.e., biology, rather than the more traditional frag\u00ad mentation into the separate study of plants and of animals. Undoubtedly Osborn's and Scott's exposure to this modern view had the favorable effect of ultimately producing a biology depart\u00ad ment at Princeton at a time when most universities had separate botany and 56 BIOLOGY zoology departments. All three of these remarkable men became assistant pro\u00ad fessors at Princeton in 1881. Professor Libbey remained in physical geogra\u00ad phy, while Professor Osborn left for the Museum of Natural History after ten years. But Professor Scott (q.v.) be\u00ad came intimately involved in the forma\u00ad tion of the first Department of Biology. Although Blair Professor of Geology, he taught courses in biology also, and after President Woodrow Wilson first formed the Departments of Geology and Biology in 1904, Scott was chair\u00ad man of both for four years, a staggering thought in modern times. The year 1908 was an important one for biology at Princeton. It not only marked the beginning of the construc\u00ad tion of Guyot Hall; it was also the year when Edwin Grant Conklin was per\u00ad suaded by President Wilson to become the first full-time chairman. The presi\u00ad dent said that he wanted to build a \"great school of biology\" at Princeton, and some years later Professor Conklin reported that he was carried away by Wilson's splendid vision of the perfect place of learning, and he told the presi\u00ad dent he would \"like to have a part in its development.\" As one looks back over the changes since 1908 it is clear that in the case of biology the \"development\" has been enormous, and it did not stop with Conklin's retirement in 1933. Before Guyot Hall was built, biology was housed in various scattered loca\u00ad tions over the campus, including the top floor of Nassau Hall. When the building was finished in 1910, the de\u00ad partment had a faculty of five, and the new quarters, which they shared with the Department of Geology, were posi\u00ad tively commodious. Today the faculty has quadrupled and has long since burst the seams of its end of Guyot Hall. Several steps were taken to meet the department's burgeoning needs. First, part of the natural history museum was converted into two floors of laboratory space. This was possible because the museum has an extremely high ceiling, said to have been built especially to accommodate the skele\u00ad tons of large animals; in fact until re\u00ad cently a giraffe stood with head un\u00ad bowed in the center of the main hall. Then, in 1960, the Moffett Laboratory was added to the south end of Guyot Hall, almost doubling the department's space. The second floor of Guyot Hall has recently been converted into a splendid, modern library, and the de\u00ad partment has overflowed into Eno Hall, formerly occupied by the Psychology Department. There is also, northwest of Princeton, the Stony Ford Field Sta\u00ad tion, whose ninety acres of beautiful wood and meadow (and the restored barn it uses for its headquarters) are employed for experimental work in ecology and animal behavior. Between 1908 and 1977 there have been only four chairman of the depart\u00ad ment, rather an unusual record. Edwin Grant Conklin served twenty-five years, Elmer Butler for fifteen years, Arthur Parpart for seventeen years, and John Bonner for twelve years. Edward Cox became chairman in 1977. Similarly, the elementary biology course has passed through relatively few hands, although as student enroll\u00ad ment has increased more faculty have been invloved. This was, for years, Conklin's famous course, which in\u00ad spired so many undergraduates. He was followed by Wilbur Swingle and, in more recent years by Colin Pitten- drigh, who was later dean of the Graduate School. There have been some important milestones in the teaching program of the department. In 1920, E. Newton JOHN PEALE BISHOP 57 Harvey (q.v.) started what must have been the first undergraduate course in biochemistry in the country. In the early 1960s, a program in biochemistry was started up by Arthur Pardee. This program, made up of professors in biol\u00ad ogy and chemistry, became a separate department in 1970. Another new de\u00ad velopment has been the introduction of two new areas of teaching and research: neurophysiology and behavior, and ecology and evolution (population biol\u00ad ogy). The former was organized by Vin\u00ad cent Dethier in 1967, and the latter by Robert MacArthur in 1965. Besides these new subjects, the department has strengthened its faculty in devel\u00ad opmental and cell biology (so vigor\u00ad ously initiated by Professor Conklin), and in genetics. The latter began in 1915 when Conklin persuaded George Harrison Shull to come to Princeton. Professor Shull had already achieved renown for his work on hybrid vigor; he was one of the co-discoverers of hybrid corn. At the moment, the world is in a gold\u00ad en age for the biological sciences. The interest and importance of the subject grows steadily. Princeton is fortunate in being one of the most desirable places to do graduate study; and the under\u00ad graduate enrollment, with the strong increase in interest in medicine and the life sciences in general, has more than doubled in the last few years. The de\u00ad partment no longer lies obscurely in the laryngeal cavity of the whale. John Tyler Bonner Bishop, John Peale 17 (1892-1944) who is remembered mainly as a friend of Scott Fitzgerald 17 and Edmund Wil\u00ad son '16 deserves to be better known for his own contribution to American let\u00ad ters. Having postponed entering college for three years because of illness, he was twenty-one when he came to Princeton from Charles Town, West Virginia. Dean Gauss, who came to know him from his classes in French and Italian literature as well as from Bishop's work on the Nassau Lit, said that he came with \"a more carefully thought out and more accomplished mastery of the technique of English verse\" than any other undergraduate in the talented group then writing for the Lit. Scott Fitzgerald was drawn to the Lit group by his great admiration for Bishop, who became the model for Tom D'Invilliers, the patrician poet in This Side of Paradise. \"John looked the poet he was,\" Dean Gauss wrote. \"There was an air of distinction about all that he did. . . . Even as a freshman, he had a self-possession and a self- mastery which gave him the poise and bearing of a young English lord. Scott's unruly Irish temperament, his irresist\u00ad ible love of glamour made these aris\u00ad tocratic qualities something he would forever envy but never acquire and I feel confident they suggested that Burke's Peerage type of name, D'Invil\u00ad liers, which he gave John in the novel.\" Edmund Wilson also greatly admired Bishop; he was later to call him the most distinguished poet ever graduated from Princeton. Bishop succeeded Wil\u00ad son as managing editor of the Lit, and later, on their return from the war in France, brought out with him a collec\u00ad tion of their verse and prose, The Un\u00ad dertaker's Garland. In later life Bishop wrote poems for his two Princeton contemporaries, \"No More the Senator,\" an exhortation to a friend (Edmund Wilson) to give up serious political activity and to with\u00ad draw into private virtue, and \"The 58 RICHARD P. BLACKMUR Hours,\" an elegy on Scott Fitzgerald. Over a period of twenty-four years he published four books of poetry, a vol\u00ad ume of short stories, a novel, and many critical essays, besides serving on the staff of Paramount Pictures, as manag\u00ad ing editor of Vanity Fair, and as po\u00ad etry reviewer for the Nation. Professor Joseph N. Frank, who wrote two essays on Bishop's work, said that he was \"that rare thing in Ameri\u00ad can literature, a . . . writer who, though incapable of supreme creative achieve\u00ad ment, keeps alive a sense for the high\u00ad est values.\" It is this type of writer [Professor Frank declared] whom the French delight to honor, recognizing their importance for the continuance of a vital cultural tradition. . . . Bishop, it would appear, was quite conscious of the role his type of writer could play in American life. Asking what the example of France could mean for America, he answered, \"It means that we must find a way to reconcile our own past with the vast past of Western civilization.\" Perhaps the greatest praise we can give John Peale Bishop is to say that in his own devotion to the values of art, he helped American literature take a step forward in achieving that rec\u00ad onciliation. In 1948 Wilson edited Bishop's col\u00ad lected essays, and in the same year, Allen Tate, another close friend, edited, with a preface and personal memoir, his collected poems. Blackmur, Richard P. (1904-1965), be\u00ad came one of America's foremost literary critics\u2014and one of Princeton's most distinguished professors\u2014without the benefit of an academic degree. During the years after his graduation from the Cambridge, Massachusetts, High and Latin School, he worked in a Cam\u00ad bridge bookstore and sat in on lectures at Harvard, but he did not become a candidate for a degree, choosing to at\u00ad tend, in fellow critic Leon Edel's words, \"the school of his own bold in\u00ad telligence.\" He began his literary career as a regular contributor to The Hound and Horn, one of the earliest and most influential of America's \"little magazines.\" In 1935 the publication of his first volume of essays, The Double Agent, marked the beginning of what was to become known as the New Criti\u00ad cism, a school of criticism that revolu\u00ad tionized the teaching of literature in American universities by directing the student's attention to a close analysis of the language of literary works. The independence that permitted Blackmur to develop his talents outside the framework of a formal college edu\u00ad cation was also at the center of his writ\u00ad ing, with its \"avoidance of academic stereotypes\"\u2014one of the virtues sin\u00ad gled out for mention by his colleague Allen Tate, whose recommendation brought Blackmur to Princeton in 1940 to help conduct Dean Christian Gauss's Creative Arts Program. The same in\u00ad dependence characterized his twenty- five year teaching career at Princeton. A faculty tribute prepared by Professors Edward T. Cone, Alan S. Downer, and Edmund L. Keeley described Black\u00ad mur as a man who provided \"a constant challenge to both intellect and imagina\u00ad tion,\" a challenge available to any col\u00ad league, student, or friend; those who chose to accept the challenge \"became participants in a continuing conversa\u00ad tion.\" According to these associates, Blackmur's \"informal talk produced a comprehensive body of criticism,\" and displayed an immense range of knowl\u00ad edge \"coupled with a profound but BLAIR HALL 59 simple wisdom, a 'natural piety' that rooted his critical constructions, no matter how elaborate or abstruse, in his native New England soil.\" Blackmur himself may have best de\u00ad fined the power that made him a memorable teacher. \"Only those have force,\" he once wrote in reference to Dean Gauss, \"who know it is not theirs unless it is given to others.\" Students who took his courses in poetry, literary criticism, and creative writing have tes\u00ad tified to his success in conveying his own gift of force, perhaps most appro\u00ad priately in the words of one who wrote, \". . . if I were to tell the truth, next time I'm asked 'Where do you come from?' I'd say, I come from R. P. Blackmur.' \" His literary reputation was based on his poetry as well as his criticism. The first of his three books of poetry, From Jordan's Delight, was praised by Allen Tate as \"one of the most distinguished volumes of verse in the first half of the century,\" and his six collections of criti\u00ad cism, in the estimate of the Kenyon Re\u00ad view, made him one of the two or three contemporary critics \"likely to en\u00ad dure.\" His critical range took him from the studies of modern poetry in his first book to the discussions of politics and the cold war in later works like The Lion and the Honeycomb. He lectured frequently here and abroad, and en\u00ad joyed the distinction of being the first man of letters to hold the Pitt Profes\u00ad sorship of American History and In\u00ad stitutions at Cambridge University. He was Princeton's first Hodder Fellow, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, vice-president of the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and a Fellow in American Letters at the Library of Congress. Blackmur conceived and found the necessary financial support for the Christian Gauss Seminars in Criticism (q.v.) in 1949, and directed them from 1957 to 1965. According to one partici\u00ad pant, English critic-novelist Alfred Alvarez, \"they turned out to be the brightest intellectual happenings in Princeton.\" At impromptu parties after each seminar, Alvarez wrote, \"Black\u00ad mur . . . would argue in fierce, sidelong bursts and with obvious enjoyment far into the night.\" Professors Cone, Downer, and Keeley concluded their tribute to Blackmur with this commen\u00ad tary on the seminars, which they called \"one of his enduring legacies to the University\": Once a colleague was asked, \"What is the real purpose of the Gauss Semi\u00ad nars?\" He replied, \"They make it possible for Blackmur to talk with his friends.\" Many would have consid\u00ad ered this justification enough. Blair Hall, the University's first col\u00ad legiate Gothic dormitory, was a Ses- quicentennial gift of John Insley Blair (1802-1899), a trustee of Princeton from 1866 to 1899. As a boy in Warren County, New Jer\u00ad sey, Blair left school at age eleven to work in a country store. At eighteen he owned his own store, at twenty-seven he was operating a chain of five general stores and four large flour mills. He next acquired an interest in the iron mines at Oxford Furnace and helped found the Lackawanna Coal & Iron Company. He then helped organize the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad and later, the Union Pacific Railroad. At one time he was president of sixteen railroads and was reputed to own more miles of railroad right-of- way than any other man in the world. In 1864 he endowed the professor\u00ad ship of geology then held by Arnold 60 GEORGE HENRY BOKER Guyot; it is Princeton's second oldest endowed chair. Asked for a few re\u00ad marks after his installation as a trustee in 1866, he reminded the Board that his own formal education was limited; he had spent most of his life learning addi\u00ad tion and now, he said, \"I have come to Princeton to learn subtraction.\" He gave the funds for Blair Hall in 1896; it was built in 1897. He did other exer\u00ad cises in subtraction in favor of Blair Academy in Blairstown, NJ., and of the Presbyterian Church, making gifts of land and money toward the building of more than a hundred churches in towns he had helped lay out along the route of the Union Pacific and other western railroads. Blair Hall was designed by Cope and Stewardson, who were among the first to apply the Tudor Gothic style to American college dormitories. Blair Hall is considered their masterpiece. In 1907 Blair's son, DeWitt Clinton Blair 1856, who was also a trustee 1900-1909, gave the extension of Blair Hall that terminates in a gateway tower on University Place. When first built, Blair, Little and the Gymnasium marked the western boundary of the Campus. Originally the Pennsylvania Railroad tracks came to the foot of the broad steps leading up to Blair Arch, which served as the en\u00ad trance to the Campus for visitors arriv\u00ad ing by train. This was a convenience for most people but a mixed blessing for students living in Blair; the puffing engine parked below often kept them awake and the soot from its smokestack blew into their rooms. In 1918 the rail\u00ad road station near the foot of the steps was moved a quarter of a mile to the south and the intervening tracks taken up, making way for the post-World War I dormitory development that Blair Tower now overlooks. Boker, George Henry 1842 (1823- 1890), a founder and the first editor of the Nassau Monthly (as the Lit was called in its early years), was fall, hand\u00ad some, and patrician, with, a friend thought, \"the form of Apollo and a head the counterpart of the bust of Byron.\" He was the College's best poet since Philip Freneau 1771, and an equally ardent patriot: \"If there is one offence in a nation, which we should willingly forgive,\" he said in one of his contribu\u00ad tions to the Nassau Monthly, \"it is the undue pride and admiration of its great men.\" In later life he published two vol\u00ad umes of poetry, wrote a number of plays, six of which were produced, and served as United States Minister to Turkey and to Russia. His most success\u00ad ful play was the verse tragedy, Francesca da Rimini, based on the story of Paolo and Francesca; it was first produced in 1855 and revived, with great acclaim, in 1882 and 1901. Most widely known of the patriotic verse he wrote during the' Civil War was his \"Black Regiment\" (celebrating the charge of the Negro troops at Port Hudson in 1863), which moved Oliver Wendell Holmes to write him an en\u00ad thusiastic note of praise. Boker's poem, \"Our Heroic Themes,\" which he read before the Phi Beta Kappa Society of Harvard on July 20, 1865, contained one of the earliest tributes to Abraham Lincoln. It con\u00ad cluded: No king this man, by grace of God's intent: No, something better, freemen, -President! A nature modelled on a higher plan, Lord of himself, an inborn gentleman! WILLIAM GORDON BOWEN 61 Bowen, William Gordon was installed as seventeenth president of Princeton on June 30, 1972, and began his presi\u00ad dency on the following day. In a simple ceremony in Nassau Hall's historic Faculty Room, witnessed by members of the Board of Trustees and represent\u00ad atives of the faculty, administration, students, and alumni, he took the oath of office on the Bible that originally be\u00ad longed to President John Witherspoon. Born on October 6, 1933, in Cincin\u00ad nati, Ohio, he was valedictorian and class president at Wyoming High School and top-ranking scholar, student body co-chairman, and Ohio Confer\u00ad ence tennis champion at nearby Deni- son University. He came to Princeton in 1955 as a Woodrow Wilson Fellow in the Graduate School and the following year married Mary Ellen Maxwell of Cincinnati. In 1958, when he was not quite twenty-five, he took his Ph.D. and joined the faculty as an Assistant Professor of Economics and a research associate in the Industrial Relations Section, winning appointment a year later as Jonathan Dickinson Preceptor. He became director of graduate studies in the Woodrow Wilson School at thirty, Professor of Economics and Pub\u00ad lic Affairs at thirty-one, and provost at thirty-three, and was elected president when he had just turned thirty-eight. Bowen was regarded as an outstand\u00ad ing teacher by both his department and his students and for a number of years gave the introductory course, Eco\u00ad nomics 101. (As president, he has con\u00ad tinued to teach sections of the course.) A tireless scholar, he wrote numerous books and articles. After publishing two early studies on the wage-price issue and on wage behavior in the postwar period, he brought out a report on the effects of Princeton's involvement with the government in the operations of the University, The Federal Government and Princeton University. Following a research trip to the United Kingdom in 1962, he published Economic Aspects of Education, which included a skillful analysis of university financing in the United States and Great Britain. A year later, he and William J. Baumol were named research directors of a Twen\u00ad tieth Century Fund study of the eco\u00ad nomic foundations of theatre, opera, orchestra, and dance in the United States. Their Performing Arts: The Economic Dilemma, published by the Fund in 1966, was described by one critic as a landmark study of the economics of culture. On leave of ab\u00ad sence in 1966-1967 as a McCosh Fac\u00ad ulty Fellow, he worked with T. A. Fin- egan of Vanderbilt University to com\u00ad plete The Economics of Labor Force Participation, which reviewers called the most authoritative work of its kind. During his years as provost, Bowen was deeply involved in the University's conversion to coeducation, its program to increase the enrollment of minority group students, and its efforts to bring the budget more closely in line with in\u00ad come. Under his guidance, a priorities committee formed to advise on budget cutting outlined various ways to reduce Princeton's financial deficit, producing a report so impressive that the Ameri\u00ad can Council for Education sent copies of it to 4,000 educational institutions as a model. Thanks to the committee's recommendations, and record support from Annual Giving, a balanced budget was achieved for the fiscal year 1971- 1972 after two years of successive deficits. Although Bowen's expertise in the economics of education was a signifi\u00ad cant factor in his election as president, the choice was further influenced by a general recognition of his enormous 62 energy and broad intelligence, and, in the words of a faculty colleague, \"his easy manner, his delightful sense of humor, his ability to get along with people and to listen and to understand their point of view, and his ability to take quick and decisive action once his mind was made up.\" In his brief remarks at the installation ceremony in Nassau Hall in 1972, Pres\u00ad ident Bowen said he found his induc\u00ad tion \"a very humbling experience,\" having had an opportunity to observe at first hand \"the variety and intensity of the pressures that beat upon the office and the person holding it.\" But he was encouraged, he said, by the sources of strength the president could draw upon, and particularly by the power of the very idea of Princeton as a place of learning given life for over two hundred years by trustees, faculty, administra\u00ad tive staff, alumni, and students under the leadership of his predecessors\u2014all sixteen of whom were looking down upon the assembly from their portraits on the walls with, he noted, \"an occa\u00ad sional hint of skepticism in the eye.\" I know [he continued] that Princeton future, no less than Princeton past, will draw strength from the great array of people who care about her and from the spirit that binds all of us together. This strength is represented here today in this historic room. Those of us gathered here, coming from different generations, different backgrounds, different regions, different vocations, possessing an extraordinary variety of viewpoints and perspectives, never\u00ad theless share an abiding commitment to this University. This is not to say that we shall al\u00ad ways agree; nor should we. Conten\u00ad tion is the life blood of any good uni-JAMES BOYD versity, for there has never been a single path to the truth and it is by testing ideas that we sharpen them and make them serviceable. But the spirit of our advocacy is as important as its quality. May all of us, and the many more whom we represent, con\u00ad tinue to study and to think inde\u00ad pendently, to exercise our freedom, but always with mutual respect, with compassion as well as precision, with courage and good humor, and with the best interests of this University ever in mind. It is in this spirit that I now look forward to doing what I can, with you, for Princeton. Boyd, James (1888-1944) was born in Pennsylvania and brought up in North Carolina. At Princeton he wrote verse and fiction for the Tiger and was its managing editor in his senior year. After graduation in 1910, he studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, and served overseas with the Army Ambu\u00ad lance Service in World War I. He then returned to North Carolina, where he wrote five historical novels. His two best known are laid in North Carolina, Drums (1925), during the American Revolution, and Marching On (1927), during the Civil War. Roll River (1935) is about his native Harrisburg, Long Hunt (1930) and Bitter Creek (1939) about the frontier West. The Manuscripts Room of Firestone Library is dedicated to Boyd's memory. Inscribed on a silver tablet are these words of his: The belief that leads to a democ\u00ad racy is this: that every man has some\u00ad thing sacred about him. This sacred- ness is held to be inherent and per\u00ad petual: no ruler, no religion, no group of men, no government is jus\u00ad tified in violating it. It is the first HUGH HENRY BRACKENRIDGE 63 principle of man's life and nothing takes precedence over it. Brackenridge, Hugh Henry (1748- 1816), a powerfully built, twenty-year- old Scotsman with a booming voice and fierce countenance, must have cap\u00ad tured the attention of his younger classmates when he entered the class of 1771. Instead of courting the Muses, he appeared better suited for clearing the barrens of York County, Pennsylvania, to which his parents had emigrated from Scotland when he was a child. But as his quick and lasting friends James Madison and Philip Freneau soon rec\u00ad ognized, this farmer's son possessed impressive classical learning, oratorical skills, and a wit as ready as his fists. With his passion for knowledge and for moral and public good, Brackenridge had before him a career in public serv\u00ad ice and letters that would lead him to the bench of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and to the first rank of early American writers. An avid Whig at Princeton and later a Jeffersonian democrat, Brackenridge joined Freneau, Madison, and others in forming the American Whig Society to counter the conservative Cliosophic Society. These activities led Freneau and Brackenridge to collaborate on Father Bombo's Pilgrimage to Mecca in Arabia, a satire on American manners that may be the first work of prose fic\u00ad tion written in America. They also combined their talents in composing a patriotic poem of epic design, \"The Ris\u00ad ing Glory of America,\" which Bracken\u00ad ridge read at the commencement exer\u00ad cises of 1771 at Nassau Hall. After his graduation Brackenridge sought a calling through which he could best attain his lifetime goal of educating Americans for liberty. He completed his training for the ministry, taught for some time, and served successfully as headmaster of a Maryland academy. The Revolutionary War found him as an army chaplain preaching fiery patriotic sermons to the soldiers. Hoping for a wider sphere of influence, he started the United States Magazine in Phila\u00ad delphia in 1778, but its lagging sub\u00ad scriptions convinced him to change his profession and location. He took a law degree and moved to the tiny village of Pittsburgh, where he later reflected that his aim in \"offering myself to the place\" was \"to advance the country and thereby myself.\" Soon a distinguished citizen of Pittsburgh and founder of the first western newspaper, The Pittsburgh Gazette, he was elected to the state as\u00ad sembly, where he fought for the adop\u00ad tion of the Federal Constitution and ob\u00ad tained state endowments for the estab\u00ad lishment of the Pittsburgh Academy (University of Pittsburgh). Outspoken and uncompromising, he lost a bid for re-election because he followed his conscience and opposed popular senti\u00ad ment in supporting federal controls; and he also nearly lost his life when he attempted to mediate the Whiskey Re\u00ad bellion. During his years as a judge (1799- 1814), Brackenridge continued his un\u00ad tiring efforts to instruct the people. In addition to a steady flow of satires, nar\u00ad ratives, and published sermons, he de\u00ad voted himself to his masterwork, Mod\u00ad ern Chivalry, a long comic narrative in the tradition of Don Quixote and Tom Jones. Written, he said, as an entertain\u00ad ing lecture on morals and society for \"Tom, Dick, and Harry of the woods,\" the novel exposes the folly of a people whose ignorance and greed causes them to elect corrupt and hypocritical leaders. Through this work, published in several volumes between 1792 and 64 CYRUS FOGG BRACKETT 1815, Brackenridge finally achieved his goal of reaching a large portion of the people with his moral precepts. His novel was called \"a textbook for all classes of society,\" and his son reported that his name \"became a household word for half a century.\" In recent years modern reprintings of his writings and critical re- evaluations have greatly enhanced his literary reputation, placing Bracken\u00ad ridge squarely at the beginning of a democratic tradition in American litera\u00ad ture that includes Whitman and Twain. Like them, Brackenridge was often dis\u00ad couraged by the folly of Americans, but he never lost faith in the ultimate pos\u00ad sibilities of an educated democratic people. Emory B. Elliott, Jr. Brackett, Cyrus Fogg (1833-1915), first Joseph Henry Professor of Physics and founder of the Electrical Engineering Department, was born on a farm in Parsonfield, Maine. He put himself through Bowdoin College by teaching in country schools, graduating in 1859 when he was twenty-six. While con\u00ad tinuing to teach, he studied medicine at Bowdoin and at Harvard, and received his M.D. degree from the Medical School of Maine in 1863. For ten years thereafter he held professorships of natural science, chemistry, zoology, geology, and physics at Bowdoin. In 1873 Brackett was called to Princeton to occupy a new chair in physics founded in honor of Joseph Henry [q.v.]. He soon became an ad\u00ad viser to the trustees in their efforts to improve instruction in scientific sub\u00ad jects and was also influential with the faculty in the development of the scien\u00ad tific curriculum. One of his first tasks was to build up the College's equip\u00ad ment, which, after Henry's departure in 1848, had been allowed to fall behind new developments in physics. He was mechanically skillful, and constructed much of the apparatus needed for his ingenious lecture demonstrations him\u00ad self. Brackett believed that physics should be an essential part of every student's education; and he drew upon literature and philosophy as well as other sciences to arouse interest in his subject. He was generally regarded as one of the most brilliant lecturers of his day and one of the most stimulating influences in the intellectual growth of his students. Brackett's own interests were stimu\u00ad lated by the developments in electricity of the seventies and eighties. He was closely associated with Thomas Alva Edison, who frequently sought his ad\u00ad vice and counsel, and developed a dynamometer to measure the power delivered by Edison's early generators. He was also acquainted with Alexander Graham Bell and testified in the litiga\u00ad tion that established Bell's claims to the basic patents for the telephone. Brackett's lecture room, according to tradition, was the first electrically lighted classroom in America. He con\u00ad structed a dynamo and battery system for this purpose soon after Edison in\u00ad vented the incandescent lamp. He also rigged up Princeton's first telephone line, which extended from his labora\u00ad tory in the School of Science to Profes\u00ad sor Young's office in the observatory on Prospect Avenue. He was thus led, in 1889, to under\u00ad take the development of a school of electrical engineering, leaving respon\u00ad sibility for undergraduate courses in physics to his associate, Professor Wil\u00ad liam F. Magie [q.v.]. The program of the new school was designed for college graduates with a strong background in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and it emphasized advanced study of general electrical science. THE BRIC-A-BRAC 65 With Professor William A. Anthony of Cornell (who initiated the electrical engineering course there), Brackett wrote a Textbook of Physics (1884), which was widely used in the closing years of the last century. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1877 and became a charter member of the American Physical Soci\u00ad ety when it was organized in 1899. He drew upon his early medical training both as chairman of the University's Sanitary Committee, originally in charge of the college infirmary, and as president of the Board of Health of New Jersey from 1888 to 1908. Brackett's engaging personality won the warm regard of colleagues and stu\u00ad dents. It also inspired the gift of Palmer Physical Laboratory by Stephen S. Palmer, father of Edgar Palmer '03, one of Brackett's students in electrical engineering, and its endowment by David B. Jones 1876 and Thomas D. Jones 1876, two of his early students in physics. Palmer Laboratory was com\u00ad pleted in 1908, the year Brackett, then seventy-five, retired. Commenting on Brackett's retirement in his annual re\u00ad port, President Wilson wrote: Few college careers have been more notable than his. He worked in the quiet field of mind whose achieve\u00ad ments are not talked about outside the circle of those who are intent upon science or letters, and gave his brilliant gifts to the work of teaching and organization rather than to the work of investigation for which he was so admirably fitted; but the ap\u00ad plication of his fine force to the work he had to do produced remarkable results in developing the study of physics at Princeton. Princetonians gave Brackett an ova\u00ad tion at Commencement in 1910 when President Wilson awarded him the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws. Brackett is memorialized by a lec\u00ad tureship, founded by the Princeton Engineering Association in 1921, and by an endowed professorship in physics, donated in 1927 by Thomas D. Jones 1876 to give expression to \"a debt of gratitude\" he said he owed Brackett \"as a teacher and friend.\" Brackett Hall, one of the six units of the Engineering Quadrangle built in 1962, is also named for him. Bric-a-Brac, The, undergraduate year\u00ad book, first appeared in 1876. The founding editors hoped their \"compact and comprehensive summary of every feature of the college\" would help fill the gap left by the college catalogue, which, they felt, did not sufficiently represent the interests of under\u00ad graduates. The editors of the second issue voiced sentiments frequently shared by their successors: \"Though meeting with delay and discourage\u00ad ment, we have persevered and now offer [this year's] Bric-a-Brac, hoping it will meet with favor.\" In 1966 the editors were still struggling with an age-old problem: \"If your picture is fuzzy and your name spelled back\u00ad wards, we apologize, but we did our best.\" The Brie, which began as a 96-page 5\u00bd by 9 inch paperback, had, within a decade, doubled its pages and acquired a hard cover. It continued to grow and assumed a 9 12 inch format in 1937. One Brie editor, Mahlon Pitney 1879, became a supreme court justice. Several became college presidents: John Grier Hibben 1882 (Princeton), Robert C. Clothier '08 (Rutgers), Henry P. Van Dusen '19 (Union Theological Seminary), Paul Havens '25 (Wilson). A few became writers, editors, or publishers: Booth Tar-66 BROWN HALL kington 1893, Ernest well Struthers Burt Jr. '35, An\u00ad drew Turnbull Brown Hall (1892) was of math\u00ad ematics professor Albert B. Dod's sis\u00ad ter, Mrs. David B. Brown, in memory of her husband; she was also the donor of Dod Hall (q.v.). This dormitory was designed by John Lyman Faxon, who, like other architects of his era, was a votary of the Italian Renaissance style. He modeled Brown after a Florentine palace, but, as Professor Thomas J. Wertenbaker later observed, \"the com\u00ad pleted building, with its heavy lines . . . had little of the charm of Italian ar\u00ad chitecture. \" Bunn, Btenjamin] Franklin 07 (1875- 1971) probably knew, and was known by, more members of the University than any other Princetonian in this cen\u00ad tury. His popularity on the campus car\u00ad ried over into the community at large: in his time no citizen was better known than he. As manager of the University Store 1908-1947, he was universally ap\u00ad preciated as the dispenser of the store's annual rebate checks, which he person\u00ad ally handed out to waiting queues sev\u00ad eral weeks before Christmas. For many years he served as a timer at football, basketball, track, and swimming con\u00ad tests. For half a century he was graduate treasurer of the Triangle Club and accompanied the club on its annual Christmas trip. For almost as long he was graduate treasurer of the Daily Princetonian, the Princeton Tiger, and a number of other student enterprises. For a score of years he was manager of the McCarter Theatre. The seniors summed it up in their Faculty Song: Oh, Bacon Bunn, you crafty guy, Your finger is in every pie; But once a year you do relent, And give us back our ten per cent. The nickname \"Bacon Bunn'\" came from a popular student snack\u2014crisp bacon in a roll\u2014sold by the Jigger Man. Once during the depression of the 1930s Bunn reduced the store's rebate to eight percent but managed to follow his customary practice of trading in his Buick every other year, as the seniors noted in another version of his verse in the Faculty Song: Oh, Bacon Bunn, you went too far, In buying that new Buick car. Oh, Bacon, you're a clever gent, But where's our other two percent? A farmer's son from Chester County, Pennsylvania, whose schooling had been interrupted by responsibilities at home, Bunn entered Phillips Exeter Academy when he was 25 and Princeton three years later at 28. He worked his way through Exeter by tak\u00ad ing care of the headmaster's furnace, at Princeton by working in a student- managed bookstore. On graduation in 1907 he became a clerk in the recently founded University Store and in 1908 became its manager. He had a finger in every pie in the Princeton community, too. He was a founder and officer of the University Laundry and the Princeton Savings and Loan Association, and a director of the Princeton Water Company. He was mayor of Princeton Borough and later of Princeton Township, the only person ever to occupy both offices. For thirty years he was president of the trustees of the First Presbyterian Church and helped select five of its pastors. He was a director of the United Fund, the Princeton Hospital, the Chamber of Commerce, and a trustee of the Westminster Choir College. AARON BURR, SR. 67 Bunn was chairman of a citizens' committee that raised funds for the purchase of a ceremonial mace pre\u00ad sented to the University at the 200th anniversary of the opening of Nassau Hall\u2014a symbol ofthe long and close re\u00ad lationship of the University to the Princeton community. In 1963 the Princeton Chamber of Commerce gave him a \"man of the years\" award and in 1965 the Princeton Y.M.C.A. estab\u00ad lished an award in his name, given an\u00ad nually for outstanding community serv\u00ad ice. Bunn's name is perpetuated in the University by a basketball award estab\u00ad lished in 1931 and by a prize for sophomores on the business staff of the Daily Princetonian set up by the senior business board in 1964. At the University's Bicentennial in 1947, when Bunn received an honorary degree of Master of Arts, he was cited as follows: Faithful steward for forty years ofthe many trusts committed to him by the Princeton community, untiring ally of the University administration and faculty under three presidents; coun\u00ad sellor and friend of generations of undergraduates, his sturdy loyalty is an inspiration to all Princeton men. Burr, Aaron, Sr. (1715/6-1757) was Princeton's second president, but be\u00ad cause his predecessor, Jonathan Dick\u00ad inson, died the year he took office, it was Burr who did most of the work of organizing the College and making it a reality. Burr's work was also cut short by death, but during the ten years he served, the curriculum was devised, the student body enlarged tenfold, new friends made for the College, substan\u00ad tial gifts obtained, and a permanent home found in Princeton. Burr was born in Fairfield, Connec\u00ad ticut, and graduated from Yale at the head of his class in 1735. After studying divinity at New Haven, he was called to the Presbyterian Church in Newark, New Jersey, where he conducted a classical school similar to Dickinson's at Elizabethtown. He was associated with Dickinson in the founding of the Col\u00ad lege and was the youngest clergyman among its original trustees. On Dickin\u00ad son's death in October 1747, he was in\u00ad duced to take the embryonic college under his care in Newark and a year later was formally elected president. Ezra Stiles, then tutor and after\u00ad wards president of Yale and an intimate acquaintance of Burr's, noted in his diary that Burr was a \"small man as to body, but of great and well improved mind. . . . a hard student. A good clas\u00ad sical scholar in the 3 learned Tongues [Hebrew, Greek, Latin] . . . well studied in Logic, Rhetoric, Natural and Moral Philosophy, the belles Lettres, History, Divinity, and Politics. He was an excellent Divine and Preacher, pious and agreeable, facetious and soci\u00ad able; the eminent Christian and every way the worthy man.\" These talents Burr applied to the College with diligence and devotion, beginning with his inauguration at the first Commencement on November 9, 1748, when he delivered, from mem\u00ad ory, a forty-five minute oration in Latin, and conferred an honorary de\u00ad gree on the College's leading patron and benefactor, Governor Jonathan Belcher (q.v.). He carried on the in\u00ad struction of the students with the as\u00ad sistance of one tutor and later, as en\u00ad rollment grew, of two. The students boarded out in town and attended classes in the parsonage and later in the county courtrooms above the county jail, which was not far from the Presby\u00ad terian Church. 68 AARON BURR, SR. Burr was a bachelor when he as\u00ad sumed the presidency. Some four years later, on June 29, 1752, he married Esther Edwards, third daughter of the celebrated divine, Jonathan Edwards (q.v.) of Stockbridge, Massachusetts. The wedding took place in Newark and the senior class gave a piece of silver as a wedding present. Joseph Shippen, Jr., a member of the junior class, wrote his father that President Burr had \"made a visit of but three days . . . at Stockbridge, in which short time, though he had not . . . seen the lady these six years, I suppose he ac\u00ad complished the whole design.\" The bride was fifteen years younger than her husband, who was then thirty-six. Young Shippen admired her beauty and thought her \"rather too young for the president.\" As he came to know her better he discovered that she possessed qualities not unsuitable for a presi\u00ad dent's wife: \"I think her a woman of very good sense,\" he wrote, \"of a gen\u00ad teel and virtuous education, amiable in her person, of great affability and agreeableness in conversation and a very excellent economist.\" Burr served for three years without salary, and filled both the offices of pastor and president until 1755 when, at the request of the trustees, he was relieved of his pastoral duties to devote full time to the College. He drew up the first entrance requirements, the first course of study, the first set of rules and regulations, and supervised the erection of the first building, Nas\u00ad sau Hall, to which he, his two tutors, and seventy students moved in No\u00ad vember 1756. President Burr did not have long to enjoy the fruits of his endeavors. Soon after the removal to Princeton, the ill\u00ad ness of one of the tutors obliged Burr to perform his duties as well as his own. The growing needs of the College also required him to make frequent trips through the colonies in search of funds. It was on returning from one such ar\u00ad duous trip that he learned the news of the death of his close friend and ally, Governor Belcher. He sat down at once in spite of exhaustion and a high fever to write the funeral sermon. Two days later he rode his horse to Elizabeth- town, where he delivered the sermon, although \"it was seen that he was fitter for his bed than the pulpit.\" He re\u00ad turned to Princeton grievously ill and died several weeks later at the age of forty-one. He was buried in the Prince\u00ad ton Cemetery\u2014the first in the Presi\u00ad dent's Lot\u2014after a service conducted, as he had requested in his will, \"in the plainest manner consistent with de\u00ad cency,\" and the money thus saved applied to charitable uses. In Benjamin Franklin's Pennsylvania Gazette Burr's death was reported as follows: September 29, 1757. Last Saturday died the Rev. Aaron Burr, President of the New Jersey College, a gentle\u00ad man and a Christian, as universally beloved as known; an agreeable companion, a faithful friend, a tender and affectionate husband, and a good father; remarkable for his industry, integrity, strict honesty, and pure, undissembled piety; his benevolence as disinterested as unconfined, an excellent preacher, a great scholar, and a very great man. Esther Burr survived her husband by less than a year; she died of smallpox at the age of twenty-six, leaving their two children, four-year-old Sarah and two- year-old Aaron, Jr. Sarah married Tap\u00ad ping Reeve 1763 (q.v.), who was to be Chief Justice of Connecticut. Aaron, Jr., who graduated from Princeton in HOWARD CROSBY BUTLER 69 1772, became the third vice-president of the United States. Burr, Aaron, Jr. (1756-1836), third vice-president of the United States (1801-1805), was thought to be one of the most brilliant students graduated from Princeton in the eighteenth cen\u00ad tury. Woodrow Wilson said he had \"genius enough to have made him im\u00ad mortal, and unschooled passion enough to have made him infamous.\" His father was Princeton's second president; his maternal grandfather, Jonathan Ed\u00ad wards, was Princeton's third president. The younger Aaron Burr was left an or\u00ad phan when he was two years old, his father and mother (and both maternal grandparents) having died within a year. He did not respond well to the discipline of his austere uncle, Timothy Edwards, several times running away from home and attempting to go to sea. He entered the sophomore class at Princeton at the age of thirteen and graduated with distinction at sixteen in 1772, a year after James Madison and Philip Freneau. He was a member of the Cliosophic Society and for his Commencement Oration chose the prophetic topic \"On Castle Building.\" Burr studied theology for a while and then law. After the Revolutionary War, in which he served with distinction as a field officer, he took up the practice of law in New York City and entered poli\u00ad tics, serving as a member of the New York state assembly, attorney general of New York, and United States senator. In the presidential election of 1800, he received the same number of electoral votes as Thomas Jefferson, but the tie was broken in the House of Rep\u00ad resentatives in Jefferson's favor, and Burr became vice-president. Four years later, on July 11, 1804, in the historic duel at Weehawken, New Jersey, Burr mortally wounded his pro\u00ad fessional rival and political enemy, Al\u00ad exander Hamilton. Thereafter came his errant political adventures in the West, his trial for treason, and his acquittal. Burr's chief counsel at the trial was Luther Martin 1766, a fellow member and one of the founders of the Cliosophic Society. A few years before his death, the society invited Burr to preside at its commencement meeting, and its members took part in the pro\u00ad cession at Burr's funeral in Princeton in 1836. President Carnahan preached the funeral sermon in Nassau Hall (in which he decried the evils of dueling). Escorted to the Princeton Cemetery by members of the faculty, students, alumni, a military band, and the Mercer Guards, Burr was buried with full military honors at the foot of his father's and grandfather's graves in the President's Lot. Burr, Aaron, Hall, named in 1977 for Princeton's second president, occupies the southeast corner of Washington Road and Nassau Street. Built in 1891 as a chemical laboratory, it later housed the Department of Chemical Engineer\u00ad ing and is now the home of the De\u00ad partment of Anthropology. Butler, Howard Crosby 1892 (1872- 1922), archaeologist and Professor of the History of Architecture, was first Master in Residence of the Graduate College and first director of the School of Architecture. In his early student days he played leading roles in the first productions of the newly founded Triangle Club and helped organize the college's third eating club, Tiger Inn, whose clubhouse he later designed. In his senior year, under the influence of Professor Allan Marquand, he acquired a serious interest in the history of art, 70 CABINET OFFICERS which he further developed in graduate study at Princeton, the Columbia School of Architecture, the American Academy in Rome, and the American School of Classical Study at Athens. He organized and led three archaeological expeditions into the Syrian Desert and two expeditions for the excavation of ancient Sardis, discovering there long-hidden treasures that enriched modern knowledge of Lydian, Greek, Syrian, and Roman civilizations. The diplomatic skill and the personal cour\u00ad age Butler demonstrated on these ex\u00ad peditions were legendary. Professor Marquand told of Butler's braving the Bedouins of the Syrian desert, unsup\u00ad ported by the guards usually consid\u00ad ered necessary, and of how, on another occasion, when all the others had run to their quarters for firearms, Butler, un\u00ad assisted and armed only with a bamboo cane, quelled an insurrection among the natives at Sardis. \"His tact and tions with the charm of romance\" which was carried over into his teaching, where he also demonstrated \"a subtle instinct for divining and evoking the la\u00ad tent powers of those he taught.\" As Master in Residence, first at the experimental graduate hall \"Merwick\" and then at the Graduate College itself, his serenity, self-discipline, and intel\u00ad lectual integrity exerted an influence attested to by many of the graduate students of that era. As Professor of Architecture, \"he stood almost alone,\" in Professor Mar- quand's words, \"in transcending his subject and in revealing it against its broad and deep historic background both as complete in itself and as an or\u00ad ganic part of human achievement.\" His teaching inspired a group of alumni ar\u00ad chitects to initiate a movement that re- resulted in the establishment of the School of Architecture in 1920, with Butler as first director. \"If we were to ask for a motto for his life,\" said Dean West, \"I think the say\u00ad ing of an old Italian scholar would be most fitting: go to wake the dead.' Professor Butler did wake the dead,\u2014 dead impluses in students to newness of life, dead cities of the Orient rising again under his magical touch.\" A portrait of Butler hangs in Procter Hall in the Graduate College and the following inscription, discovered on a Christian tomb in northern Syria by his first expedition, appears in his memory on a stone in the vestibule: \"I sojourned well; I journeyed well; and well I lie at rest. Pray for me.\" His name is per\u00ad petuated by a professorship in the his\u00ad tory of architecture created in 1931 by gifts from his former students.

Princeton incumbents of the latter posts have been: Secretary of the Army\u2014Frank Pace, Jr. '33 (Ark.) 1950-1953 R. '54 (Va.) 1975-1976 (Ford). Secretary of the Air Force\u2014James H. Douglas '20 (111.) 1957- 1959 (Eisenhower); Dudley C. Sharp '27 (Tex.) 1959-1961 (Eisenhower). Caldwell Field House, The, is a memo\u00ad rial to Charles W. Caldwell, Jr. '25, head coach of football from 1945 through 1956. It was built in 1963 with donations from his family and from some 3,500 alumni and friends. As an undergraduate, Caldwell played center and fullback on Roper's 1922 \"Team of Destiny\" and was a star pitcher on the baseball team (he later had a tryout with the New York Yan\u00ad kees and played briefly in several games). He was assistant football coach at Princeton for three years, and head coach at Williams for seventeen, before his appointment as Princeton's head coach in 1945. A keen student of the game, he developed a new kind of single wing football, adding to the tra\u00ad ditional power plays of that formation elements of deception, which he bor\u00ad rowed from the modern T. One of Caldwell's favorite words for an effective team or player was \"solid.\" Another, which he used to describe a quality he thought indispensable to success was \"desire.\" He himself pos\u00ad sessed abundant desire, and the results he obtained in the dozen years he was coach were eminently solid. His teams won six successive Big Three cham\u00ad pionships in the years 1947 through 1952, two more than the previous re\u00ad cord, which Harvard teams set under Percy Haughton in the years 1912 through 1915. Caldwell's teams of 1950 and 1951, both Lambert Trophy win\u00ad ners as the best in the East, won every game\u2014the first time Princeton had two perfect seasons in succession since full- length schedules were introduced in 1878 (the teams of 1874 and 1875 won all their games\u2014two each). Caldwell was voted Coach of the Year in 1950 and given the annual award of the Touchdown Club of New York in 1952. He was stricken with cancer of the pan\u00ad creas early in the season of 1957 and died November 1 in his fifty-sixth year. President Goheen summed up his career succinctly: \"Charlie was an in\u00ad spiring teacher who devoted his life to the education of young men.\" The Caldwell Field House contains dressing and training facilities for teams that use the neighboring athletic facili\u00ad ties\u2014Palmer Stadium, the Jadwin Gymnasium, and a half-dozen playing fields. The Field House is larger than it looks\u2014only one of its two-and-a-half stories shows above ground level\u2014and, because of its flexible design, more serviceable even than its true size would suggest. Dressing rooms are convertible to dormitories for visiting teams, and coaches' offices to dressing rooms for officials at game time. The Class of 1925 Room, a pine-paneled, carpeted lounge, is used by coaches for conferences with their staffs and their teams, and by families of players waiting to meet them at the end of a game. A medical treatment center is equipped for treating sprained muscles, wrenched joints, and other aches and pains suffered in contact sports. Caldwell is also remembered by a trophy, established by the under\u00ad graduate body in 1957, awarded annu\u00ad ally to that senior on the varsity football squad who has shown the greatest im\u00ad provement. Campbell Field, one of the playing fields east of Palmer Stadium, was created in 1962 by his family and CAMPBELL HALL 73 friends as a memorial to Tyler Campbell '43, who gave his life in the Second World War. Ail-American la\u00ad crosse defenseman, class president\u00ad elect and varsity club president-elect, Campbell left college at the end of his junior year to enlist in the army as a private in the mountain troops. Gradu\u00ad ated from Officers' Candidate School as a 2nd lieutenant, he led his men on the invasion beachheads of Sicily, Salerno, Anzio, and southern France, was wounded twice and twice promoted in the field, reaching the grade of captain. He was killed in action in France while commanding an infantry company of the 7th Army, two years after leaving college. Edwin G. Baetjer II '43 and John Gregg Thomas, Jr. '43, Camp\u00ad bell's close friends and clubmates, also died in service. Campbell Hall was the gift of the Class of 1877, a strong competitor with 1879 for first place among the outstanding classes graduated during the McCosh presidency or, for that matter, during the entire nineteenth century. The building was named for John A. Camp\u00ad bell (1856-1938), a banker and a leading citizen of Trenton, who was president of the class all four years in college and for fifty years thereafter. It took the class less than an hour to raise most of the funds for the dormitory\u2014a unique instance in the long history of alumni generosity. The necessary pledges poured forth in a spontaneous outburst during a high- spirited dinner at their thirtieth re\u00ad union in 1907. Woodrow Wilson's friend and classmate, Cleveland H. Dodge 1879, who was present as a guest, said it was the greatest show he had ever attended\u2014a judgment sup\u00ad ported by the verbatim report of the proceedings preserved in 1877's class history, put out at its fiftieth reunion. The leading actors in the perform\u00ad ance were John Campbell, M. Taylor Pyne, George Allison Armour, J. How\u00ad ard Ford, and Frank S. Layng. The last three were known as \"the three short\u00ad stops\"\u2014not because they had played baseball but because they had stopped short of graduation. Pyne, a trustee of the University, precipitated the outburst when, speak\u00ad ing of the University's need for more dormitories, he reminded his class\u00ad mates that 1879 had given Seventy- Nine Hall and ten other classes had each given an entry in Patton, and asked whether 1877 couldn't be counted on for an entry in one of the other new dormitories. \"No, no!\" Armour called out, \"Let's give the whole dormitory.\" Someone else shouted, \"Three cheers for Princeton,\" and Layng said, \"We've got to give more than three cheers, we've got to give our money, our good money.\" As Pyne continued speaking, Armour passed his calling card up to President Campbell, who followed Pyne's speech, by reading this cryptic mes\u00ad sage: \"3 shortstops $15,000.\" Armour got up and explained that he and Ford and Layng wanted to start the ball roll\u00ad ing because they were so grateful for having spent one year at Princeton. After Armour observed that \"those who have been here four years will probably want to do a good bit more than that,\" Pyne said, \"Put me down for $10,000,\" Henry Fairfield Osborn followed with, \"I'll bring it up to $30,000, John,\" and Layng added \"this short-stop makes it $35,000.\" Someone called for three cheers for Frank Layng, and they were given. \"If he had graduated,\" President Campbell reflected, \"I believe he 74 CAMPUS would have given us an entire dormi\u00ad tory, completely furnished.\" Someone asked how much the dor\u00ad mitory would cost; Campbell said he assumed at least $100,000. A half- dozen men called out pledges from $500 to $5,000. Campbell held up another of Armour's cards. This one pledged $5,000 in memory of a classmate who had recently died. Men from other classes who were guests at the dinner got caught up in the excitement and soon there were pledges from '74, '75, '76, '78, and '79. There was a flurry of $500 pledges \u2014most of them $100 a year for five years. One was from a man who was at\u00ad tending his first reunion. We're mighty glad to see him here,\" Campbell said, \"He's a fine-looking fellow and we're proud of him.\" Campbell then an\u00ad nounced that Henry B. Thompson, another trustee, had doubled the con\u00ad tribution he had previously made. VOICE: Good for Harry. SECOND VOICE: Give him another bottle of wine. PRESIDENT: We now have $56,000, we ought to work up to $77,000 to\u00ad night. More contributions followed, small and moderate. President Campbell hoped no one would be too modest about speaking out. Layng advised, \"Send out for three more bottles and we'll get the rest.\" A minute later Campbell announced an additional $10,000 from Pyne and another calling card from Armour with $5,000 in mem\u00ad ory of still another recently deceased classmate. Then, according to the ver\u00ad batim report: FORD [the third shortstop]: I under\u00ad stand that I'm down for $1,000; I'd like to increase that to $5,000. Campbell announced that contribu\u00ad tions were now well over $77,000 and that he was appointing a committee of seven to carry the project to comple\u00ad tion. This unplanned part of the Class's dinner program then ended as follows: PYNE: When I spoke earlier, I thought that, with great effort, the Class might raise $17,000 for an entry in a dormitory. The Class of '79 had to work a year before they got as much as we've raised to\u00ad night. I never felt so proud of our class, as I do at this moment. LAYNG: Take another drink from that cup, Armour. ARMOUR: Not on your life. I would give forty then. PRESIDENT CAMPBELL: I think we ought to stand up and sing Whoop 'Er Up for '77. SONG: Oh, we'll whoop 'er up for '77. The Class soon raised the balance needed, Cram, Goodhue, and Fergu\u00ad son drew up the plans, and Campbell Hall was ready for occupancy in the fall of 1909. Campus. The use of the word campus (Latin for \"field\") to mean the grounds of a college originated at Princeton. Its earliest recorded use is found in a letter Charles C. Beatty 1775 wrote to his brother-in-law Enoch Green 1760 on January 31, 1774: \"Last week to show our patriotism, we gathered all the steward's winter store of tea, and hav\u00ad ing made a fire in the Campus, we there burnt near a dozen pounds, tolled the bell and made many spirited re\u00ad solves.\" Previously yard was the word used at Princeton, as it was at Harvard (where it was first used in 1639) and other col\u00ad leges. An example of this usage occurs CAMPUS 75 in a letter James Madison 1771 wrote to his father on July 23, 1770. Referring to the interception by Princeton stu\u00ad dents of a letter a group of New York merchants had addressed to the mer\u00ad chants of Philadelphia, asking them to break the agreement not to import Brit\u00ad ish goods, he . . . burnt by the Students of this place in the college Yard, all of them appear\u00ad ing in their black Gowns and the bell Tolling.\" In a monograph on the use of the word campus in the Publications of the Colonial Society of Massachusetts (Vol\u00ad ume III, 1897), an etymologist, Albert Matthews (Harvard 1882), suggests that the word may have been introduced by President John Witherspoon who came to Princeton from Scotland in 1768. Matthews reasons that Witherspoon, accustomed to the city universities of Scotland, must have been struck by the different aspect at Princeton where the college grounds consisted of a perfectly flat field with no enclosures, and was therefore moved to apply to the grounds \"a classical term which fitly de\u00ad scribed their character.\" The word yard remained in use at Princeton after the introduction of campus and for some time the two terms were used interchangeably. Thus, while the faculty in 1787 spoke of \"the back campus of the College,\" the trustees referred in 1802 to \"the west side of the College yard,\" and then in 1807 to \"the front Campus.\" Gradually campus won out over yard. In 1833 it appeared in print for the first time in a book by an Eng\u00ad lishman, James Finch, Travels in the United States and Canada, in which he writes of Princeton: \"In front of the Col\u00ad lege is a fine campus ornamented with trees.\" In 1851, Benjamin H. Hall (Harvard 1851) in his College Words and Customs, noted that at Princeton \"the college yard is denominated the Campus.\" After the Civil War the word spread to other colleges and was finally given lexicographical recognition by in\u00ad clusion in the Century Dictionary of 1889. Samuel Eliot Morison in Three Centuries of Harvard (1936), referring to Princeton's adoption of campus in 1774, wrote, \"One by one every other American college has followed suit, until Harvard alone has kept her Yard.\" BEGINNINGS OF THE CAMPUS The College possessed no grounds for the first six years after its founding in 1746. Classes were held at Elizabethtown in the parsonage of Pres\u00ad ident Dickinson and later at Newark in the parsonage of President Burr and, when numbers grew, in the county courthouse, in a room above the jail. The trustees sought another location, \"more sequestred from the various temptations attending a promiscuous converse with the world, that theatre of folly and dissipation\"\u2014and one nearer to the center of the Province. Then, in the winter of 1752-1753, the village of Princeton won from the town of New Brunswick the right to become the permanent home of the College by se\u00ad curing for it, as stipulated by the trus\u00ad tees, \u00a31,000 proclamation money, ten acres of cleared land, and 200 acres of woodland to provide fuel. The citizens of Princeton primarily responsible for this achievement were John Stockton (father of Richard Stockton 1748), Thomas Leonard (a trustee of the College), John Hornor, and Nathaniel FitzRandolph, all large landowners. All four contributed to the \u00a31,000 fund and secured subscriptions from others. In December 1752 Stockton and Leonard gave 200 acres of 76 CAMPUS woodland a mile or so north of the vil\u00ad lage (about where Witherspoon Street now meets Route 206), and Hornor gave seven acres of cleared land in the same vicinity. At their winter meeting on January 24, 1753, the trustees voted to accept Princeton as the place of the College \"when Mr. [Fitz] Randolph has given a Deed for a certain tract of land four hundred feet Front and thirty poles [495 feet] depth, in lines at right angles with the broad street where it is pro\u00ad posed that the College shall be built.\" The day after this meeting Nathaniel FitzRandolph and his wife Rebeckah gave the trustees a deed for \"a certain plot of land bounded Northward by the King's Highway, and containing about four acres and a half.\" In his private journal FitzRandolph noted that al\u00ad though the deed mentioned a consider\u00ad ation of 150 pounds, he \"never did re\u00ad ceive one penny of it,\" since \"that was only to confirm the title.\" After the Revolution, when the Col\u00ad lege was in financial straits, the trustees sold the 200 acres given by Stockton and Leonard and the seven acres given by Hornor. GROWTH OF THE CAMPUS FitzRandolph's four and one-half acres provided the site of Nassau Hall (and what came to be called the Front Campus), to which President Burr and his pupils moved in 1756. At a sheriff's sale four years later the trustees bought land surrounding three sides of the Col\u00ad lege. These five or six acres widened the Front Campus and added what came to be known as the Back Campus, ending at a line just behind what was to be the site of Whig and Clio Halls. For eighty-five years the Campus remained unchanged. Then, through small accretions by purchase and gift over a period of thirty years, it gradu\u00ad ally increased in size to about twenty acres. In 1878 Robert L. and Alexander Stuart of New York bought a house and thirty-five-acre estate called \"Pros\u00ad pect,\" adjacent to the Campus, and gave it to the College for use as the res\u00ad idence of President McCosh. Their gift more than doubled the acreage of the Campus, providing precious space for the growth of the College and later of the University. In 1889 the grounds were quad\u00ad rupled when the residuary legatees of the estate of John C. Green (who was a generous supporter of the College dur\u00ad ing President McCosh's administration) purchased and presented the Potter Farm, consisting of 155 acres of meadow and woodland extending from the Campus to the canal between Washington Road and the railroad. \"This magnificant gift,\" M. Taylor Pyne, chairman of the committee on grounds and buildings, told the trus\u00ad tees, \"preserves forever our beautiful view, and leaves ample room for the growth of the University for many years to come.\" It made it possible to say, Pyne added, that Princeton now pos\u00ad sessed \"the finest Campus of any Col\u00ad lege in America.\" About this time alumni took great in\u00ad terest in securing land for the Univer\u00ad sity. Among their leaders were the South East Club, a group who had lived in the south entry of East College in the 1870s: Howard Russell Butler, William Allen Butler, and Bayard Henry of the Class of 1876; M. Taylor Pyne and Henry B. Thompson, 1877; Percy R. Pyne Jr., 1878; C. C. Cuyler, Cleve\u00ad land Dodge and William Earl Dodge, 1879. For many years they met annu\u00ad ally at a dinner at which M. Taylor Pyne, the first of their number to be CAMPUS 77 elected a trustee, spoke of the College's needs. Their efforts began to bring results in 1905. At the commencement meeting of the trustees that year, Pyne, as pres\u00ad ident of the Springfield Association whose twenty members had contrib\u00ad uted to the cause, presented a deed for a 230-acre tract lying between the Theological Seminary and Stony Brook, on which a golf course had recently been laid, and where the Graduate Col\u00ad lege was later to be built. That same day, James Laughlin, Jr. 1868, as pres\u00ad ident of the Olden Association, pre\u00ad sented a deed for the ninety-three-acre Olden Farm, extending from the ridge of Prospect Avenue to Stony Brook on the east side of Washington Road. This farm became the site of athletic facili\u00ad ties and playing fields, faculty housing, and a center for mathematics, physics, and astrophysics. A year later, the creation of a lake, which Howard Russell Butler prevailed upon Andrew Carnegie to finance, re\u00ad sulted in the University's acquisition of some 400 acres\u2014the lake itself and land fronting it for over a mile and a half (see Lake Carnegie). Howard Butler, acting as Carnegie's attorney in acquiring thirty-three par\u00ad cels of land needed for the lake, struck a snag in his negotiations for a small strip of about three acres just east of Harrison Street. This the Gray family refused to sell unless their entire farm of 107 acres was purchased; and Car\u00ad negie, for his part, was unwilling to buy upland. Howard Butler's brother, Wil\u00ad liam Allen Butler, organized a syndi\u00ad cate of South East Club members and others to purchase the farm, which they were able to do through a down pay\u00ad ment, a bank loan, and a mortgage. After the loan was paid off, Butler in\u00ad duced his mother to satisfy the mortgage, enabling the syndicate in 1912 to present the deed for the prop\u00ad erty to the trustees. The major part of this gift, named the Butler Tract, was used for graduate student housing, a smaller part, retaining the name Gray Farm, for faculty housing. In 1917 Bayard Henry obtained gifts from alumni and friends that permitted the University to negotiate, under his guidance, with the Pennsylvania Rail\u00ad road to move the Princeton station from the foot of Blair Tower to its present lo\u00ad cation, thus releasing about seven acres of land, which the University used for six dormitories south of Blair Hall along University Place. At the spring meeting of the trustees in 1922, Henry informed the board that he and several other alumni would do\u00ad nate the Mather farm, extending south from Lake Carnegie along Washington Road, if the University would purchase the Schenck farm, adjoining it on the west, which had just come on the mar\u00ad ket. The board accepted the donation and made the additional purchase, thereby adding 216 acres to its holdings and giving the University ownership of all the land that lies between Washing\u00ad ton Road and the line of University Place from Nassau Street to U.S. Route 1. That same year M. Taylor Pyne be\u00ad queathed twenty-five houses and lots and twenty-seven and a half undevel\u00ad oped acres in the Broadmead section, east of the Olden Farm. In 1951 the University acquired 825 acres\u2014the largest land acquisition in its history\u2014by its purchase of the grounds and buildings of the Rockefeller Insti\u00ad tute for Medical Research a few miles northeast of the central Campus. This area, used for advanced research in sci\u00ad ence and engineering, was named the James Forrestal Campus (q.v.). The Major farm of one hundred 78 CAMPUS acres, adjoining the Forrestal Campus to the east, was acquired in 1967. By 1970 the University's grounds comprised 2,325 acres. ARCHITECTURE AND LANDSCAPING In the College's early years the Georgian style of Nassau Hall pre\u00ad vailed, with two minor but conspicuous exceptions. The style was followed in twin buildings, a library and a refectory (later Stanhope Hall and Philosophical Hall) erected in the early 1800s on either side of Nassau Hall, and in twin dormitories, East College and West College, constructed in the 1830s on either side of the Back Campus. The two exceptions came a few years later when Whig and Clio were built in the style of classical Greek temples. A more permanent break with the Georgian tradition came after the Civil War, in the administration of President McCosh, with the erection of Ruskinian Gothic buildings such as the Chancellor Green Library (now the Student Cen\u00ad ter). Chancellor Green's replacement of Philosophical Hall altered the formal symmetry of the Campus, by fore\u00ad shadowing the more extensive altera\u00ad tion that was to come with the razing of East College to make way for Chancel\u00ad lor Green's companion, Pyne Library. The McCosh administration brought an advance in landscaping, which had had modest beginnings with the plant\u00ad ing of sycamore trees in front of the president's house in 1765 and of elm trees on the Front Campus in the 1830s. President McCosh, who brought a Britisher's love of gardens with him when he arrived in 1868, took pleasure in laying out the grounds and locating the buildings, and under his care and planning the Campus began to take on a park-like appearance. The Ruskinian Gothic of the McCosh era was followed, after a few diver\u00ad gences such as Alexander Hall (Roman\u00ad esque) and Brown and Dod dormitories (Italian Renaissance) by the Tudor Gothic of Oxford and Cambridge, adopted at the time of the Sesquicen- tennial through the influence of Profes\u00ad sor Andrew Fleming West, the organiz\u00ad ing genius of that celebration, and M. Taylor Pyne, chairman of the trustees' committee on grounds and buildings. From the completion of Pyne Library and Blair Hall in 1897 to the building of Firestone Library fifty years later, col\u00ad legiate Gothic was the prevailing ar\u00ad chitectural style at Princeton, achieving its highest expression in McCosh Hall, Holder Hall, the Graduate College, and the University Chapel. The long-range development of the Campus was facilitated by the creation of the office of supervising architect and the appointment of Ralph Adams Cram as first incumbent in 1907. Henry B. Thompson, who succeeded his class\u00ad mate, Pyne, as chairman of the commit\u00ad tee on grounds and buildings, was in\u00ad fluential in this appointment as he was in that of Beatrix Farrand as first con\u00ad sulting landscape gardener in 1915. Cram made the first master plan for the Campus. He visualized two main axes, one extending south from the rear of Nassau Hall, the other east and west from the tiger gateway between Blair and Little along McCosh Walk to Wash\u00ad ington Road. The north-south axis he conceived was later accented by the construction in 1969 of the plaza and steps, guarded by tigers, between the Whig and Clio Halls. Stephen F. Voorhees 00 was super\u00ad vising architect from 1930 to 1949, Robert B. O'Connor from 1949 to 1954. When he died in 1965, Voorhees left a fund for the beautification of the Cam-PRINCETON CANNONS 79 pus. Douglas Orr was consulting ar\u00ad chitect (a title adopted in 1954) from 1954 to 1966. Pietro Belluschi was ap\u00ad pointed to this office in 1966 and was succeeded by Charles H. Warner, Jr. in 1975. Orr devised a new master plan that added another east-west axis farther south, extending from the tennis courts to Palmer Stadium. After 1948 col\u00ad legiate Gothic gave way to a variety of modern architectural styles in buildings such as the Engineering Quadrangle, the Woodrow Wilson School, the Art Museum, Fine and Jadwin Halls, and the newer dormitories. Most of the beautiful planting on the Campus was the work of Mrs. Farrand. She began with the Graduate College and by the time she retired she had overseen the planting of trees and shrubs around some seventy-five build\u00ad ings. Her successors as consulting land\u00ad scape architect (the slightly altered title was adopted in 1946) have been Alfred Geiffert, Jr. from 1943 to 1958, Markley Stevenson from 1958 to 1961, Michael Rapuano from 1961 to 1974, and since 1974, Robert L. Zion. Successors of Henry B. Thompson as chairman of the trustees' committee on grounds and buildings have been Franklin D'Olier 1898 from 1928 to 1942, Dean Mathey '12 from 1942 to 1949, Sanford G. Etherington '06 from 1949 to 1951, Henderson Supplee, Jr. '26 from 1951 to 1974, and since 1974, Richard R. Hough '39. Cannons, Princeton. The Big Cannon in the center of the quadrangle back of Nassau Hall and the Little Cannon be\u00ad tween Whig and Clio Halls were both left in Princeton after the Revolution, and both loomed large in student life in the nineteenth century. After lying on the Campus for years, the Big Cannon was taken to New Brunswick during the War of 1812 to defend that city from possible enemy attack. It remained on the common there until one dark night in 1835 when the Princeton Blues, a military com\u00ad pany of citizens of the town, loaded it on a wagon and headed back to Princeton. Their wagon broke down at the outskirts of the town, and they abandoned the cannon at the side of the road. There it lay until another dark night a few years later, when about a hundred students, led by Leonard Jerome 1839 (maternal grandfather of Winston Churchill), hoisted it onto a heavy wagon they had engaged, along with a team of horses and driver, brought it to the campus, and\u2014before Vice-president Maclean could inter\u00ad vene\u2014dumped it in front of Nassau Hall. In 1840 it was moved and planted muzzle down in its present location. Since the 1890s, the Big Cannon has been the focus of championship football bonfires and the seniors' class day exer\u00ad cises in June. It inspired Joseph F. Hewitt '07 and Arthur H. Osborne '07 to compose \"The Princeton Cannon Song\" (\"With cheers and songs we'll rally round The Cannon as of yore/And Nassau's walls will echo with the Princeton Tiger's roar''). The Little Cannon was the cause of the celebrated \"Cannon War\" with Rutgers in 1875, when it was taken to New Brunswick by Rutgers students under the mistaken impression that it was a lost cannon belonging to that city. After a retaliatory raid by Princeton students and some sharp corre\u00ad spondence between the presidents of the two colleges, a joint committee was appointed by the respective faculties 80 EDWARD CAPPS and the dispute settled amicably, Princeton students agreeing to return some muskets they had taken from New Brunswick, Rutgers students the cannon they had taken from Princeton. The day the New Brunswick chief of police brought the Little Cannon back to Princeton, President McCosh and the whole college assembled between the two Halls to greet him. The Nassau Hall bell rang and the President made a speech. He said he was reminded of the contest over Helen in the Trojan War and suggested that the Cannon War should be immortalized in a new Iliad, written in Greek and in hexameter verse. The students cheered wildly, but there is no evidence that McCosh's effort to give the Cannon War a cultural turn bore any fruit. The \"War,\" how\u00ad ever, was well covered by the press. Capps, Edward (1866-1950), noted champion of Greek-American friend\u00ad ship who was Professor of Classics at Princeton from 1907 to 1935, became interested in the classics at Illinois Col\u00ad lege in his native Jacksonville. He re\u00ad ceived his A. B. there in 1887, took his Ph.D. at Yale in 1891, and later studied in Greece and Germany. He taught at Illinois College, at Yale, and at the University of Chicago (where he was the founder and editor of Classical Philology), before being called to Princeton by Woodrow Wilson in 1907. Capps's Princeton colleagues were soon impressed by his abundant energy and his loyalty to his beliefs and friends. As a member of the faculty committee on the graduate school, he sided with Wilson in the Wilson-West controversy over the location of the graduate college, taking a vigorous part in debate at faculty meetings and supporting Wilson to the end. One of the founders of the American Associa\u00adtion of University Professors, he was a leader during its first fight for academic freedom and served for a term as its president. He was also president of the American Philological Association. He was the first American editor of the Loeb Classical Library, the series of texts of classical authors with English translations, regarded in the profession as a notable achievement of American scholarship. Most of his adult life Capps was closely identified with Greece. \"With Lord Byron removed from the field,\" the Alumni Weekly once said, \"Profes\u00ad sor Capps would win any contest for 'best-known foreigner in Greece.' \" He first went there in the fall of 1893 as a member of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, and the fol\u00ad lowing spring took part in the School's excavation of the theater at ancient Eretria. He returned to Athens for further study in 1903, this time de\u00ad ciphering and collating a series of tab-\u00b7 lets about the theater, which also con\u00ad tained important data on that city's mil\u00ad itary and political history. At the end of the First World War, Capps spent two years in Greece as American Red Cross Commissioner and another year as United States Minister to Greece, on appointment of President Wilson. During this period, he played a leading role in the founding of Athens College, which later named a building in his honor, citing him as an \"inspiring teacher of Greek life and let\u00ad ters . . . and for nearly half a century a champion of friendship between Greece and America.\" Capps was chairman of the managing committee of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens for twenty years. In this capacity he organized the most spectacular of all American ar\u00ad chaeological ventures, the excavation of JAMES CARNAHAN 81 the Agora of ancient Athens, securing the Greek government's necessary cooperation, John D. Rockefeller, Jr.'s financial support, and Professor T. Les\u00ad lie Shear's expert services as director. He was influential in obtaining the gift of the Gennadius Library, which made the School an international cen\u00ad ter of Byzantine and Neo-Hellenic studies. Following his retirement from the University in 1935, he served as acting director of the American School in Athens for a year, and was then visiting professor at the Institute for Advanced Study for five years. Thereafter he con\u00ad tinued to work on the Loeb Classical Library and to read his favorite Greek authors with students who met with him at his home on Mercer Street. Shortly before his eightieth birthday he went to Oxford to accept a Doctor of Letters degree honoris causa; he had previously been honored by Illinois College, Oberlin, Harvard, Michigan, and Athens, and had been twice deco\u00ad rated by the Greek government. At the centennial of his first alma ma\u00ad ter, Illinois College, his family and friends founded there the Edward Capps chair of Greek and Latin. Carnahan, James (1775-1859), was a man of simple, solid virtues whose thirty-one-year tenure as ninth presi\u00ad dent of the College (1823-1854), was the longest in its history. He was born and reared in Pennsylvania, where his father farmed, first near Harrisburg, then near Pittsburgh. In 1798 James and his friend Jacob Lindly (later presi\u00ad dent of Ohio University) entered the junior class at Princeton after an ardu\u00ad ous trip over the Allegheny Mountains. Having only one horse (Lindly's), they used a system, called \"ride and tie,\" by which each rode a number of miles every day and then, tying up the horse to await his companion, walked as many more. After his graduation in 1800, Carna\u00ad han served as tutor at Princeton, studied theology with President S. Stanhope Smith, and preached for six years, before resigning because of a throat aliment that troubled him all his life. He then founded and conducted a classical seminary in Georgetown, D. C, and had been there eleven years when he was notified of his election to the presidency of the College. Not having kept in touch with de\u00ad velopments at the College, Carnahan was unprepared for what he found when he assumed the presidency: the divided counsels of the trustees and the conflicting views and interests left by Ashbel Green's administration. He thought of resigning at once, but young Professor John Maclean, Jr. persuaded him to carry on. The period of decline continued, reaching its lowest ebb five years later, when enrollment dropped to eighty students. Carnahan thought of recommending the closing of the in\u00ad stitution, but John Maclean proposed a plan for strengthening the faculty that resulted in his being elected vice presi\u00ad dent of the College. From that time on, as a trustee later observed, the College had an adminis\u00ad tration \"in which two colleagues la\u00ad bored as one man.\" Reviewing the achievements of this partnership on his retirement in 1854, Carnahan was able to report a restoration of harmony be\u00ad tween the trustees and faculty, the doubling of student enrollment and the tripling of the Faculty, the erection of East and West Colleges and Whig and Clio Halls. Carnahan paid tribute to Maclean's energy, zeal, and devotion. Maclean for his part praised Carnahan's freedom from personal ambition and 82 CARNEGIE LAKE said that his faithfulness and success in conducting the affairs of the College en\u00ad titled him to the lasting gratitude of its alumni and friends. Carnahan was genuinely modest about his own achievements. What he hoped people would remember about him, he sometimes told his family dur\u00ad ing his last years, was that it was he who planted the trees in the front Campus. Carnegie Lake was created in 1906 by the construction of a dam at Kingston that impounded the confluence of Stony Brook and the Millstone River, producing a sheet of water three and a half miles long and 800 feet across at its widest point. It was the gift of the Scottish- American steel maker, Andrew Car\u00ad negie. He had built a number of lochs in Scotland and was easily persuaded to finance one for Princeton by Howard Russell Butler and his brother, William Allen Butler, both of the Class of 1876, They and some of their college friends were determined that undergraduates should have a better place for rowing than the old canal that had been tried in the 1870s and found wanting. The Butlers succeeded where James McCosh and Woodrow Wilson failed. President McCosh had made repeated efforts to interest his fellow Scot in his plans for the College but without suc\u00ad cess. Meeting Carnegie at the railroad station on one visit, McCosh told him how honored he was to welcome him to Princeton. Carnegie replied that he had always had a warm spot in his heart for Princeton, to which Mrs. McCosh replied with spirit, \"Indeed, Mr. Car\u00ad negie, we have seen no evidence of it as yet.\" While the negotiations for the lake were in progress President Wilson tried unsuccessfully to interest Car\u00adnegie in making a substantial contribu\u00ad tion to the endowment of either the graduate school or the preceptorial sys\u00ad tem. Later when Wilson again asked for help and Carnegie answered, \"I have already given you a lake\" (Ray Stannard Baker relates), Wilson re\u00ad plied, \"We needed bread and you gave us cake.\" But the general response to Car\u00ad negie's formal presentation of the lake on December 5, 1906, was enthusias\u00ad tic. Carnegie came down from New York in a special train with five dozen friends. President Wilson, Dean Fine, and M. Taylor Pyne met them at the station, which was then at the foot of the Blair Arch steps. Climbing the steps, Carnegie smiled at a banner that hung from an undergraduate's room in Blair Tower with the words \"Welkum to the Laird of Skeebo [the name Carnegie had given his estate in Scot\u00ad land].\" Later when the academic pro\u00ad cession, led by Wilson and Carnegie, arrived in Alexander Hall for the cere\u00ad monies, his smile broadened as stu\u00ad dents in the balcony suddenly began to sing, to the tune of the then popular song \"Tammany,\" Carnegie, Carnegie He is giving us a lake\u2014 You can hear the breakers break; Carnegie, Carnegie Andy, Andy, you're a dandy Carnegie. The creation of Lake Carnegie did more than provide a place for under\u00ad graduate rowing, and for canoeing, sail\u00ad ing, fishing, and skating by members of the Princeton community. Aside from the aesthetic and healthful advantages that resulted from flooding a large marshy area, Carnegie's gift involved the purchase of hundreds of acres adja\u00ad cent to the lake, giving the University THE CATALOGUE 83 invaluable room for development it might not otherwise have been able to secure. In the 1960s it became apparent that Lake Carnegie was being threatened by some of the problems that beset larger bodies of water. One problem, reflect\u00ad ing poor land use over three decades, was the accumulation of sediment washed in by Stony Brook from the communities it drains. The other prob\u00ad lem was the more recent, rapid deposit of sewage carried by the Millstone River from nearby towns, where expan\u00ad sion of sewage treatment facilities had not kept pace with rapid growth of population. Extensive dredging was undertaken to solve these problems in the early 1970s. Castro, Americo (1885-1972), Emory L. Ford Professor of Spanish, divided a half-century of scholarly-work almost equally between Spain and the United States and, in the words of the citation for the honorary Doctor of Letters the University conferred on him in 1963, \"gracefully exemplified the union of [these] two great cultures.\" He was born of Spanish parents in Brazil and educated in Spain and France. He took his doctorate at the University of Madrid in 1911, and four years later won appointment through competitive examinations to its chair in the history of the Spanish language. In 1925 he published The Thought of Cer\u00ad vantes, a fundamental work that opened a new epoch in studies of the author of Don Quixote. Castro was a strong supporter of the Spanish Republic when it was estab\u00ad lished in 1931, serving as its ambas\u00ad sador to Germany and also in its Coun\u00ad cil of Public Instruction and its Division of Cultural Relations. He left Spain when Franco rose to power in 1937 and, after teaching at the Universities of Wisconsin and Texas, accepted a call to Princeton in 1940. Castro was regarded as one of the world's most distinguished Hispanists. His magnum opus, Spain in Her His\u00ad tory (1948), was considered a notable innovation in modern Spanish his\u00ad toriography. Written in Spanish, this work was later translated into English, Italian, German, French, and Japa\u00ad nese. He also earned international recognition as a teacher, serving as vis\u00ad iting professor at universities in Argen\u00ad tina, Chile, Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Germany, and throughout the United States. According to his colleagues, Castro was unusually successful in solving the problem of teaching the literature of one land to students of another: \"Don Americo succeeded not only in making what was obscure intelligible, and what was alien understandable, but in arous\u00ad ing . . . fervor and enthusiasm. . . . This he was able to do not so much because of his extraordinary scholarly compe\u00ad tence as because of his commitment to teaching as a priestly and prophetic calling.\" Catalogue, The, as we know it today, made a rudimentary appearance in 1819, the College having functioned happily and successfully without one for over seventy years. An earlier \"catalogue\" appeared in 1770, but it was of another kind: a list\u00ad ing of all the officers and graduates since the College's founding. For more than a century it retained the use of Latin for it headings (Praesides, Cura- tores, Facultas Artium) and roll ap\u00ad peared biennially from 1786 through 1886, again in 1896, and in 1906 culmi\u00ad nated in the General Catalogue of 84 THE CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY Princeton University 1746-1906. Mean\u00ad time, the Alumni Directory (q.v.), con\u00ad taining names and addresses of living alumni, made its first appearance in 1888. The 1819 prototype of today's annual college catalogue was entirely in Eng\u00ad lish; its twelve pages consisted of a list of the current \"officers and students of Nassau Hall.\" Beginning in 1821, the catalogue added a list of studies for each class and a half-page \"advertisement,\" giving the dates of Commencement and the fall and spring vacations. In 1829 the \"advertisement\" grew to three pages with a list of courses offered and brief references to admission proce\u00ad dures, expenses, the library, and scien\u00ad tific apparatus. The Catalogue grew with the College and the University, increasing from eighteen pages in 1844 to 668 pages in 1941. Beginning in 1942, information about graduate work was published in a separate Graduate School Announce\u00ad ment, and beginning in 1958, descrip\u00ad tions of courses for undergraduates and other material of special interest to them was issued in a separate Under\u00ad graduate Announcement. In recent years, the different issues of the Cata\u00ad logue have been undergoing changes in format and design reflecting changes in the University itself. Centennial Anniversary, The, of the College was celebrated at the Com\u00ad mencement of 1847, \"this being the oc\u00ad casion,\" Vice President John Maclean, Jr., explained, \"on which the members of the one hundredth Senior Class were admitted to their first degree in the Arts.\" Present besides the graduating seniors and their families were a large number of alumni, delegates from other colleges, the vice president of the United States (George Mifflin Dallas 1810), the governor and several ex- governors of New Jersey, a justice of the United States Supreme Court, the chief justice and chancellor of New Jer\u00ad sey and of Delaware, and other dig\u00ad nitaries. The celebration lasted only two days\u2014Tuesday and Wednesday, June 29 and 30\u2014but the committee on ar\u00ad rangements managed to pack into that brief period a remarkable volume of oratory. There were three sessions on Tuesday and two on Wednesday. All but the last were held in the First Pres\u00ad byterian Church, filled, the committee in its enthusiasm reported, \"with an audience which for beauty, intellect, and respectability could scarcely be surpassed.\" At the first session on Tuesday, Chief Justice Henry W. Green 1820 (later the Chancellor Green for whon the present student center is named) gave an ad\u00ad dress formally opening the new law school, which proved short-lived, ceas\u00ad ing operations only a few years later. At the second session James W. Al\u00ad exander 1820, the Centennial historian, spoke over two hours, \"with such elo\u00ad quence,\" the committee unhesitatingly reported, \"that the audience sat in rapt attention, missing not a single word.\" On Tuesday evening eight repre\u00ad sentatives of the junior class delivered orations, a student from Ireland on \"The Faded Shamrock,\" one from Mis\u00ad sissippi on the question, \"Why Has America No National Literature?\" At the graduation exercises Wednes\u00ad day morning, twenty-three of the sixty- two seniors receiving bachelor degrees delivered orations. In the afternoon a dinner was served to 700 persons in a large tent in back of Nassau Hall. The toastmaster, trustee James S. Green, son of ex-president Ashbel Green, offered thirteen formal THE UNIVERSITY CHAPEL 85 toasts\u2014without wine! \"Our hearts are full to overflowing\" he said, \"we need no additional excitements.\" To six of his toasts there were responses, by Vice-President Dallas, ex-Governor William Pennington 1813, and others. The program concluded with nine im\u00ad promptu toasts, some with responses, honoring President Carnahan, physicist Joseph Henry, the oldest living graduate Samuel Baldwin 1770, and others. At the end Robert McKnight 1839 of Pittsburgh, who was later a congressman, offered a toast to \"Nassau Hall and her Sons\u2014The tie which binds her absent sons increases as the square of the distance\"\u2014a sentiment, the committee noted in its official re\u00ad port, \"received with a most agreeable sensation by all present.\" Chancellor Green Student Center was originally the college library building, which was given in 1873 by John C. Green and named for his brother, Henry Woodhull Green 1820, Chancel\u00ad lor of New Jersey in the 1860s. Its ar\u00ad chitecture was inspired by the Ruskin- ian version of Venetian Gothic then popular in England. After Pyne Library was built adjacent to Chancellor Green in 1897, they both served as the University library until the completion of Firestone in 1947. Chancellor Green's conversion into a student center seven years later was made possible largely through a twen\u00ad tieth reunion gift of the Class of 1934. Chapel, The University, continues a tradition of public worship that goes back to Princeton's founding in 1746. For the first ten years of the College's existence, daily services were cele\u00ad brated in the studies of the first two presidents\u2014the Reverend Jonathan Dickinson, in Elizabethtown, and the Reverend Aaron Burr, in Newark. After the College moved to Princeton in 1756, a prayer-hall in Nassau Hall (for a time the meeting place of the Continental Congress on state occa\u00ad sions, and now the Faculty Room) was used for services until 1847, when the first chapel was built. This chapel, de\u00ad scribed in a novel of that period as \"a beautiful smile on a plain face,\" was re\u00ad placed in 1882 by the larger Marquand Chapel, gift of Henry G. Marquand, and thereafter was known as the \"Old Chapel\" until it was razed in 1896 to make way for Pyne Library. Marquand Chapel was destroyed by fire in the spring of 1920. Services were then con\u00ad ducted in Alexander Hall until 1928. The cornerstone of the University Chapel was laid in 1925, and it was dedicated on Sunday, May 31, 1928. THE DEANS Until 1928 the president of the Uni\u00ad versity was directly responsible for supervision of the Chapel programs. That year the office of dean of the chapel was created by the trustees and the Reverend Robert Russell Wicks of Holyoke was appointed as the first in\u00ad cumbent. In the same year, the chair of Dean of the Chapel of the University was endowed by their families in mem\u00ad ory of the Rev. Wilton Merle-Smith and Judge Walter Lloyd-Smith, twin brothers in the Princeton Class of 1877. The gift also provided for a deanery to house the dean and his family. Dean Wicks challenged the unexamined premises of many undergraduates and demonstrated the vitality of the Chris\u00ad tian faith in the modern world. On his retirement in 1947, Wicks was suc\u00ad ceeded by the Right Reverend Donald B. Aldrich, former Bishop Coadjutor of the Protestant Episcopal Diocese of Michigan and a charter trustee of the 86 THE UNIVERSITY CHAPEL University. An experienced pastor, Dean Aldrich counseled students com\u00ad passionately in the confused times fol\u00ad lowing World War II. Owing to ill health, he resigned in 1955. He was succeeded by the Reverend Ernest Gordon, an ordained minister of the Church of Scotland and a former minis\u00ad ter of Paisley Abbey\u2014situated in the same town where the Reverend John Witherspoon served as minister of the Laigh Kirk (low church) before his call to the Princeton presidency in 1768. REQUIRED CHAPEL ATTENDANCE The College of New Jersey was firmly rooted in the fertile soil of the Great Awakening. One of its emphases was that an individual was accountable before God for his life, his neighbors, his country, and his back yard. This re\u00ad sulted in a personal discipline of prayers, praise, and thanksgiving. For 136 years after the College began, stu\u00ad dents were required to attend morning prayers (originally at 5 a.m.) and eve\u00ad ning prayers daily, and morning and af\u00ad ternoon services on Sunday. These re\u00ad quirements were a source of student complaint and frequent pranks. Stories that have come down from alumni of that period recall that once the seats of the \"Old Chapel\" were tarred, at another time the benches were literally buried in hay, and at still another a cow was discovered up near the pulpit just before the morning service began. Irreverence of students was appar\u00ad ently most noticeable during long prayers. President Emeritus Maclean continued to take part in the services during James McCosh's presidency. He was accustomed to praying not only for the nation and for the College but also for everyone associated with their re\u00ad spective administrations. On one Sun\u00ad day he concluded his lengthy litany with additional prayers for the Seniors, the Juniors, and Sophomores, and then, Henry Fairfield Osborn 1877 re\u00ad called, \"as the Reverend Doctor reached the Freshmen, a roar of laugh\u00ad ter proceeded from the seemingly rev\u00ad erently bowed heads of the entire stu\u00ad dent body. At this unexpected 'Amen' Doctor McCosh became very impa\u00ad tient. After the disturbance was duly quelled and the Doxology sung with unusual fervor, he was heard to remark: 'Surely Doctor Maclean is in his dotage; he ought to have more sense than to pray for the Freshmen.' \" This remark is not surprising from a divine who is alleged to have opened a prayer, soon after the publication of one of his most successful books, with these words: \"O Thou who has also written a book.\" By 1882, changing views of life's priorities brought the abolition of re\u00ad quired attendance at daily vespers, and in 1902 the required Sunday afternoon service was also discontinued. By 1905 attendance at morning prayers (then held at 7 a.m.) was required only twice a week, and in 1915 this requirement was given up entirely. Protests con\u00ad tinued about Sunday chapel. A \"Chapel Strike at Princeton,\" as headlined by New York newspapers in 1914, turned out, in the Daily Princetonian's ver\u00ad sion, to At the conclusion of the prayer, the pitiable cough subsided, and the service continued uninterrupted.\" The Prince said the incident demonstrated the conviction of students that Sunday chapel should end promptly at noon; \"this is their religion.\" A few years ago, the writer received a visit from one of the ringleaders of this incident, who had been expelled for his contribution. He later went on THE UNIVERSITY CHAPEL 87 to study at a theological seminary and became a professor of theology. Required attendance at Sunday chapel ended eventually: for up- perclassmen in 1935, for sophmores in 1960, and, finally, for freshmen in 1964. The trustees' decision to remove the last vestige of compulsion was made, in their official words, \"in the best interests of a freer, more honest, creative expression of religion.\" STUDENT RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS For more than a hundred years the student-organized Philadelphian Soci\u00ad ety (1825-1930) carried on an active program in religion and social service. This society early espoused the cause of foreign missions and in later years was responsible for the founding of Prince- ton-in-Asia and the Princeton Summer Camp. The various activities of this old Princeton institution, later carried on by the Student-Faculty Association (1930-1946) and the Student Christian Association (1946-1967), have been continued under the auspices of the Chapel Fellowship and its related social service organization, the Student Vol\u00ad unteers Council (1967- ). DENOMINATIONAL SOCIETIES AND CHAPLAINS In 1925 President Hibben forbade the Reverend Frank Buchman, founder of the Oxford Group and later of Moral Rearmament, to appear on campus, in consequence of a conflict about his con\u00ad troversial techniques, particularly as practiced by recent converts. (It was the contention thus aroused that led to the dissolution of the Philadelphian So\u00ad ciety.) In the 1926 report of the Univer\u00ad sity commission on Buchmanism, the hope was expressed that the new chapel and its minister would be a means of achieving religious harmony on the campus. The achievement of this harmony has been one of the Chapel's functions. The denominational societies, and their chaplains, cooperate with the work of the University Chapel and contribute to its activities. There are eleven of these societies. The oldest of them, the Episcopal Procter Foundation, was begun in 1876 as St. Paul's Society. The Presbyterian Westminster Foundation, the Catholic Club (later the Aquinas In\u00ad stitute), the Methodist Wesley Club, and the Evangelical Fellowship were organized in the 1920s. After World War II the Jewish Hillel Foundation, Lutheran Student Fellowship, Baptist Student Fellowship, Unitarian/Uni- versalist Fellowship, Christian Science Organization, and the Orthodox Chris\u00ad tian St. Photius Society were founded. The University makes its facilities avail\u00ad able to the denominational societies for services and meetings and extends var\u00ad ious courtesies and privileges to the chaplains. In 1957 these courtesies and privileges were withdrawn from Father Hugh Halton because he had con\u00ad ducted his ministry in such a way that he had alienated from himself not only Protestant members of the University but devout Catholics as well. Thereafter the air cleared; since 1966 daily serv\u00ad ices for Catholics have been conducted in the University Chapel. THE RECENT YEARS The first noticeable consequence of the abolition of the last Chapel re\u00ad quirement in 1964 was a decline in at\u00ad tendance by freshmen and an increase in attendance by upperclassmen. When the Class of 1967 graduated, attendance took a rapid plunge due to the depar\u00ad ture of 300 seniors who had been active 88 THE UNIVERSITY CHAPEL members of the Chapel Fellowship. It was the growth of this fellowship in the years preceding the abolition of the re\u00ad quirement that insured the continua\u00ad tion of the Chapel's place on the cam\u00ad pus. It was made up of diverse groups representing a wide range of interests, such as study, discussion, religious drama, social service, music, Chapel administration, and charitable enter\u00ad prises. Although the building was once called, by some, Princeton's two- million-dollar protest against mate\u00ad rialism, and, by others, a great white whale (not elephant!), its architectural strength has contributed to its place as the center of spiritual life on the cam\u00ad pus. It is seen to be the one building that exalts the whole of creation and humanity. Since 1957 it has been kept open daily from 8 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. to serve the needs of the University com\u00ad munity; the closing service each day is an Organ Epilogue from 11 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. Sunday services are held during the twelve months of the year. Rather than a decrease, there has been a marked increase in the number of services held in the Chapel, which has resulted in a problem of scheduling the number requested. Since 1970 at\u00ad tendance at sendees has noticeably in\u00ad creased, and the degree of student par\u00ad ticipation is greater than it has ever been. An undergraduate deaconate of twenty-five men and women represents the needs, concerns, and interests of the Chapel Fellowship and of the stu\u00ad dent body as a whole. A significant portion of the Chapel's budget comes from annual gifts of the Friends of the Chapel. Religious, med\u00ad ical, educational, and charitable serv\u00ad ices engaged in by alumni are sup\u00ad ported from Chapel offerings of from $12,000 to $15,000 a year. It is in the Chapel that the University comes together as a community. This is true not only at Opening Exercises, Baccalaureate Services, annual memo\u00ad rial services for members of the Uni\u00ad versity and again for alumni, funerals and weddings; it has also been true on occasions of national tragedy such as the assassinations of President John Ken\u00ad nedy, his brother Robert, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Because it provides a center for community, it attracts a large number of alumni and visitors to its services. It has also been a bridge be\u00ad tween town and gown, and between the several academic communities of Princeton. The Thanksgiving and Christmas services are mostly for the benefit of townspeople. Organ and choral music are an im\u00ad portant part of the Chapel program. They have both come a long way since the days when Yale's President Ezra Stiles after a visit in 1770 declared the organ in Nassau Hall \"an innovation of ill consequence,\" and when John Adams, later President of the United States, reported after his visit to Princeton in 1774, \"The Schollars sing as badly as the Presbyterians at New York.\" The standard set by today's choir and musicians at the weekly serv\u00ad ices is one of excellence, and the Christmas Vespers and the Milbank Concerts are outstanding events in the University's musical calendar. Since the retirement of the noted Bach organist Carl Weinrich in 1973, the organists have been students who have performed with a dedication and loyalty that has done much to achieve the ideal of a University community of worship. The same can be said of a chapter of student organists who sus\u00ad tain the Organ Epilogue seven nights a week in term. All the musical activities are supervised by Walter Nollner, Di-THE CHARTER 89 rector of Music in the Chapel since 1973. THE CHAPEL'S CONTINUING PURPOSE The University Chapel provides a place where people can come in rever\u00ad ence to face the ultimate mystery of creation and existence. This continuing purpose is well expressed in one of the prayers that were said in the Litany of Dedication when the Chapel's doors were first opened in 1928: That, for all who with troubled hearts and minds here seek comfort and healing, this house may be as a hid\u00ad ing place from the wind and a covert from the tempest, as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. Ernest Gordon NOTE: For a description of the architecture, sculpture, and windows of the University Chapel, see: Richard Stillwell, The Chapel of Princeton University, Princeton University Press, 1971. Charter, The, which created the cor\u00ad poration originally known as The Trus\u00ad tees of the College of New Jersey, was granted in the name of King George II and \"passed the Great Seal\" of the Province of New Jersey on October 22, 1746. This charter authorized the erection of a college \"for the Education of Youth in the Learned Languages and in the Liberal Arts and Sciences,\" designated seven men, with five others to be cho\u00ad sen by them, to be the trustees of the college, and ordained that \"the said Trustees and their Successors shall forever hereafter be, in Deed, Fact & Name a Body corporate & politick. . . .\" The charter granted the trustees and their successors full power and author\u00adity to acquire real and personal prop\u00ad erty, to erect buildings, to elect a pres\u00ad ident, tutors, professors, and other officers, to grant degrees, and to estab\u00ad lish ordinances and laws \"not repug\u00ad nant to the Laws and Statutes . Great Britain, or . . . of New Jersey, and not excluding any Person of any re\u00ad ligious Denomination whatsoever from . . . any of the Liberties, Privileges, or immunities of the . . . College, on ac\u00ad count of his . . . being of a profession Different . . . Trus\u00ad tees of the College.\" The original charter was issued by John Hamilton, president of the Coun\u00ad cil of the Province of New Jersey, who was acting as governor at the time. Be\u00ad cause Hamilton's authority was ques\u00ad tioned, the legal status of the College came under attack, and a second char\u00ad ter was therefore issued in 1748 by Jonathan Belcher, newly appointed governor of the province.* It corre\u00ad sponded, for the most part, to the char\u00ad ter of 1746, but it increased the maximum number of trustees from twelve to twenty-three, made the gov\u00ad ernor of New Jersey a trustee ex-officio, and stipulated that twelve trustees were to be inhabitants of the State of New Jersey, t In 1780, the Council (i.e., Senate) and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey, on petition of the trustees, con\u00ad firmed the royal charter of 1748 with minor changes, one being that each trustee swear allegiance to the state in which he resided instead of to the king of Great Britain. A further legislative enactment, adopted in 1799, required him also to affirm his intention to sup\u00ad port the Constitution of the United States. Still another, adopted in 1866, directed him to swear to perform the duties of his office faithfully and impar\u00ad tially, thus adding the third article of 90 CHEERS the oath each new trustee has taken ever since. On February 13, 1896, the corpora\u00ad tion adopted a resolution changing its name to The Trustees of Princeton University. President Patton publicly proclaimed this change on October 22, 1896, the 150th anniversary of the granting of the first charter. The \"yearly clear value\" of real and personal property the trustees were allowed to acquire for the purpose of the corporation was limited at one time to the equivalent of 20,000 bush\u00ad els of wheat. Since 1903 the corpora\u00ad tion's capacity to receive real and per\u00ad sonal property has been\u2014legally\u2014 unlimited. In 1963, the Board of Trustees adopted a complete revision of the charter, simplifying and modernizing its language to reflect the requirements and benefits of present law and corpo\u00ad rate practice. This revision was filed with the Secretary of State as constitut\u00ad ing the current Certificate of Incorpora\u00ad tion of The Trustees of Princeton Uni\u00ad versity. * The text of the charters of 1746 and of 1748 is given in Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker's Prince\u00ad ton 1746-1896, pp. 396-404. t An amendment adopted in 1926 provided that thereafter there should be from twenty-three to forty trustees, the exact number to be fixed from time to time in the by-laws. The number who were to be residents of New Jersey was reduced to eight and, by another amendment in 1963, to one in addition to the governor and the president of the University. Cheers became a part of the Princeton student's way of life sometime in the late 1850s or early 1860s. The first cheer, \"Hooray, hooray, hooray! Tiger siss-boom-ah, Princeton!\" was adapted from the \"skyrocket\" cheer of the Seventh Regiment of New York City. Princetonians of the early 1860s re\u00admembered fifty years later hearing the Seventh Regiment give this cheer from their railroad coaches at the Princeton depot on their way to Washington, a few days after the outbreak of the Civil War. But a member of the Class of 1860 was pretty sure that he had heard a classmate give the rocket cheer in Pro\u00ad fessor Schenck's chemistry class in the spring of their senior year. The \"tiger\" (the word itself or a roar) was a common element in early cheers, generally. Its use in the rocket cheer did not refer to the Princeton mascot; he came later (see Tiger). The Princeton skyrocket cheer was quoted by Rudyard Kipling in his story A Matter of Fact (1892): An English newspaperman, encouraging his reluc\u00ad tant American colleague, a Princeton graduate, to cable a fantastic story about a sea serpent to the New York World, ends his exhortation with the words \"Sizz! Boom-ah!\" Sometime in the 1890s, the sky\u00ad rocket cheer developed into the \"loco\u00ad motive,\" Princeton's longest-used and most distinctive cheer, which starts slowly and picks up increasing speed, suggesting the sound of a locomotive: Ray 'ray 'ray Tiger, tiger, tiger Sis, sis, sis, Boom, boom, boom, ah! Princeton! Princeton! Princeton! In another cheer, used in the first half of the century, first Nassau and then Tiger were spelled out three times, followed by \"fight, team, fight.\" Still another, the \"short\" cheer, was used principally to honor individuals: \"R-r-r-ay, Lourie.\" Cheering played a more important part in football games in earlier years. With no band, time-outs were filled with locomotives and Nassau cheers, CHEMICAL ENGINEERING 91 and with no public address system, the infrequent withdrawal of a player was greeted with a short cheer in his honor. And, as a Philadelphia Press reporter brought out in his account of Yale's 29 to 5 victory over Princeton in 1900, the cheering did not end with the game. When the Yale adherents danced about on the field to celebrate their victory, he reported, the Princeton stands re\u00ad sponded with \"the steady, deep pulsa\u00ad tion of the locomotive.\" Even after everyone else had left the field and darkness was closing in, \"still in obedi\u00ad ence to the cry of a white-hatted figure up on the fence, a knot of Princetonians cheered\u2014cheered the team, cheered the scrub, cheered the team man by man, cheered Princeton, and last of all . . . sang in husky voices each verse of Old Nassau.\" In recent years cheering has been less ritualistic, more responsive to the immediate situation, with rhythmic chants such as \"go-Tiger-go,\" \"take that ball away, heh, heh, take that ball away,\" and the one-word call first used for basketball, later applied also to football: \"DE-fence,\" repeated time and again. While cheering has become less im\u00ad portant, the activities of the cheerlead\u00ad ers have become more spectacular, with tumbling on the sidelines, and push-ups under the goal posts to re\u00ad count the points after each Princeton score. Cheerleaders were once chosen for their prominence on campus (some\u00ad times as captains or managers in other sports); more recently they have been selected because of their special talents for the acrobatics of cheerleading. Chemical Engineering was first offered at Princeton in 1922 as a special pro\u00ad gram administered jointly by the De\u00ad partment of Chemistry and the newly formed School of Engineering, which drew on existing courses in both fields. The senior professor of physical chemistry, Hugh Stott Taylor, watched over the fledgling program and groomed one of his graduate students, Joseph C. Elgin (whose undergraduate work at the University of Virginia was in chemical engineering) for its even\u00ad tual leadership. On receiving his Ph.D. in physical chemistry in 1929, Elgin was appointed Princeton's first instructor in chemical engineering, responsible for develop\u00ad ing the new department's courses and facilities. He prepared himself by spending eight months as a guest of the M.I.T. chemical engineering depart\u00ad ment, then regarded as one of the best in the country. On his return he set up quarters in the old chemical laboratory, which housed the department until 1962, when it moved into its present home in Maclean Hall in the Engineer\u00ad ing Quadrangle. One of Elgin's first students, John C. Whitwell (B. S.E. 1931, Ch.E. 1932), became his col\u00ad league in 1932. Two years later Elgin and Whitwell were joined by Richard H. Wilhelm (q.v.), who had just re\u00ad ceived his doctor's degree in chemical engineering at Columbia. This trium\u00ad virate laid the foundations of the De\u00ad partment of Chemical Engineering. Their first task was to build from scratch an undergraduate curriculum in chemical engineering. In this they were later joined by Richard K. Toner, who came from New York University in 1942, and by Ernest F. Johnson, who came from the University of Pennsyl\u00ad vania in 1948. Undergraduate enroll\u00ad ment in the department grew steadily and at one time was larger than any other engineering department in the University. In 1946 a Ph.D. program was added to the original Ch.E. (later 92 CHEMISTRY M. S. E.) program of study, and in April 1948, a student in the department earned the first doctor's degree ever granted in the School of Engineering. By 1954, when Elgin gave up the chairmanship to become dean of the School of Engineering, the department had grown to an enrollment of 100 un\u00ad dergraduates and twenty-five graduate students, and a faculty of seven. Further growth, particularly in graduate instruction and research, came under the leadership of the sec\u00ad ond chairman, Richard H. Wilhelm, with the added assistance of new mem\u00ad bers of the department, including Pro\u00ad fessors Leon Lapidus, William R. Schowalter, Robert C. Axtmann, and Bryce Maxwell. In 1966 the depart\u00ad ment was cited by the Cartter report of the American Council on Education as having the second most attractive chemical engineering graduate pro\u00ad gram in the country. When Professor Wilhelm died suddenly in 1968, four\u00ad teen years after he assumed the chair\u00ad manship, the faculty was twice as large as when he took over, there were three times as many graduate students, the department had expanded into chemi\u00ad cal reactor engineering, transport phe\u00ad nomena, and control and optimization theory, and had been one of the first to make extensive use of computer technology. The third chairman, appointed in 1968, was Leon Lapidus, a member of the Princeton faculty since 1953, widely known for his work in the appli\u00ad cation of computer techniques in chem\u00ad ical engineering, for which he was given the Professional Progress (1966) and William H. Walker (1973) Awards of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. Two departmental areas of instruction and research developed during his chairmanship were the Pol\u00adymer Science and Materials Program, directed by Bryce Maxwell, recipient of the 1976 Society of Plastics Engineers' international award, and the Fusion Reactor Technology Program, closely integrated with the Plasma Physics Laboratory, and directed by Ernest Johnson, who has been associated since 1955 with the laboratory's program of research directed toward controlled fu\u00ad sion. Under Lapidus, the department reached out into new areas of research such as biochemical engineering, en\u00ad ergy conversion, and pollution control. The interest in pollution control was underlined in 1971 when the name of the Professorship of Chemical En\u00ad gineering for Nuclear Studies, then held by Robert Axtmann, was changed to Chemical Engineering for Environ\u00ad mental Studies, with the agreement of the Mobil Oil Corporation, which was then supporting it. Professor Axtmann was first chairman of the University's Council on Environmental Studies and of the School of Engineering's topical program on Energy Conversion and Resources, which offers undergraduate engineering students an opportunity to supplement their departmental major with intensive study not only of energy conversion and energy resources, but also of the environmental impact of en\u00ad ergy technologies. In May 1977, the department suf\u00ad fered its second major loss in less than a decade with the sudden death of Leon Lapidus. Arrangements were made for Ernest Johnson to serve as chairman through the academic year 1977-1978, and for William R. Schowalter, as\u00ad sociate dean of the School of Engineer\u00ad ing since 1972, to assume the chair\u00ad manship in 1978. Chemistry at Princeton may be di\u00ad vided, like Ceasar's Gaul, into three CHEMISTRY 93 parts: pre-World War I, between the wars, and post-World War II. But there was a continuity of spirit from the ear\u00ad liest years to the latest, suggested by Hugh Stott Taylor, chairman of the de\u00ad partment from 1926 to 1951, with these words, at the dedication of the Frick Chemical Laboratory in 1929: May the vivifying influence of Mac\u00ad lean in the early days of Science at Princeton be an inspiration to those who follow him in tasks of teaching and seeking in Chemistry. Dean Taylor was referring, of course, to John Maclean (q.v.), a medical doc\u00ad tor who in 1795 was appointed Profes\u00ad sor of Chemistry, at that time a rare title in this country. Maclean carried the banner of Lavoisier's New Chemis\u00ad try to the New World, and set up, in Nassau Hall, the first undergraduate chemistry laboratory in America. The following year a new chair was created, Professor of Chemistry and Natural History, and Dr. Maclean was its first incumbent, reflecting his competence in other sciences as well. Because of its association with medi\u00ad cine, chemistry enjoyed a preeminence among the sciences throughout the nineteenth century, and was a required subject for all Princeton students. To\u00ad ward the end of the century, when ex\u00ad ploration of the nation's mineral re\u00ad sources became important, the faculty included mineralogists Henry B. Cornwall and Alexander H. Phillips, and the analyst LeRoy W. McCay, a student of Bunsen and discoverer of the thio-arsenates. McCay's colleagues included Lauder Jones in nitrogen chemistry, and George Hulett, who was an authority on standard cells, but whose greatest discovery, many thought, was Hugh Stott Taylor (q.v.), whom he brought to Princeton in 1914. This young Englishman (later knight\u00ad ed by both Pope Pius XII and Queen Elizabeth II), an inspiring teacher, a bold leader, and the recipient of in\u00ad numerable honors for his pioneering work in catalysis, set the pattern for re\u00ad search and teaching at Princeton for the next half-century. These were exciting times for re\u00ad search. The atmosphere in the labora\u00ad tory was so thickly permeated by catalysis that it prompted the observa\u00ad tion that Princeton was the only major American university that did not need to offer a course in catalysis, since the students were absorbing it by osmosis. Dean Taylor ascribed catalytic action to \"active spots\" on vast inert areas of catalyst surfaces, spots so few that they could be rendered inactive by tiny amounts of poisons. This concept also paved the way for other discoveries. The chain reaction theory of inhibition catalysis was elucidated and illustrated with rows of falling dominoes in Princeton in 1928, decades before the domino theory became a political by\u00ad word. During this period, Frick Laboratory became world-famous for researches in photochemistry and the mechanisms of chemical reactions. When heavy water was discovered in 1931, and used as a tool in these areas, there was more heavy water (about a test-tube full!) in Frick than anywhere else in the world. Notable scholars attracted to Princeton during Taylor's chairmanship included N. Howell Furman, president of the American Chemical Society in 1950 and first recipient of its Fisher Award in Analytical Chemistry; the physical chemists Charles P. Smyth and Robert N. Pease, authorities in dipole moments and combustion kinetics, re\u00ad spectively; and the organic chemists, Eugene Pacsu in carbohydrates, and 94 CHEMISTRY Everett S. Wallis, who made notable contributions in the areas of molecular rearrangements and especially in hor\u00ad mone research with his pupil Lew Sarett (cortisones) and Nobel Prizeman Edward Kendall (thyroxin and cor\u00ad tisone). For fifteen years, from 1931 to 1946, Henry Eyring was a bright star in the chemistry department firmament, developing the theory of absolute reac\u00ad tion rates and applying it to chemical and biological processes, viscosity, dif\u00ad fusion, and ion transport. A devout Mormon, Eyring left Princeton to be\u00ad come Dean of the University of Utah Graduate School. Arne Tiselius's work in electrophoresis and Willard Libby's in \"carbon dating were researches initi\u00ad ated in Frick Laboratory for which they were later to receive Nobel Prizes. Ar\u00ad thur Tobolsky's brilliant researches in the field of polymers were unfortu\u00ad nately cut short by his untimely death in 1972. Lecture demonstrations have been a Princeton heritage since the days of Dr. Maclean. As early as 1795 the trustees allocated \u00a32000 for additions to the li\u00ad brary and for \"philosophical apparatus\" for Dr. Maclean's demonstrations. From Dr. Maclean's share of this generous allotment\u2014eight times the president's annual salary\u2014the sum of 75 cents had to be used to pay a fine that the College incurred for transport\u00ad ing Maclean's equipment from Phila\u00ad delphia on a Sunday. Later, the trus\u00ad tees purchased extensive chemical apparatus from one of Maclean's suc\u00ad cessors, John Torrey (q.v.), another medical doctor, who lectured to the students on chemistry and natural his\u00ad tory from 1830 to 1854. Princeton alumni will recall interesting lectures in organic chemistry by Fred Neher, Gregg Dougherty, and Everett Wallis, and also the lively lecture demonstra\u00adtions in freshman chemistry by William Foster, Alan Menzies, Charles Smyth, Hubert Alyea, and John Turkevich. During World War II, Taylor and Furman journeyed daily to Columbia University, where Taylor was associate director of that branch of the Manhat\u00ad tan project. Charles Smyth was a member of the ALSOS mission sent to Europe by General Grove (\"alsos\" is Greek for \"grove\") to search for Ger\u00ad man secret weapons. Under the Gov\u00ad ernment Engineering Science and Management Training Program, all members of the department con\u00ad ducted, in Newark, Elizabeth, and Bound Brook, graduate courses for over 3,000 chemists in industry. The postwar years brought radical changes to the department, because the making and manipulation of molecules now required expensive ma\u00ad chines, costly to operate. The annual chemistry budget for operating ex\u00ad penses, exclusive of maintenance, which was $30,000 from 1920 to 1950, rose to nearly $2,000,000 by 1968, much of this for project research. By the late 1950s Dean Taylor's col\u00ad leagues had passed on; a new staff was assembled by Donald Hornig, who was chairman from 1958 to 1964. A large new wing, generous gift of an anony\u00ad mous donor, doubled the research space in Frick in 1964, and housed a biochemistry faculty that later formed a separate department (q.v.). The chemistry department is not large; there are approximately twenty faculty, thirty seniors, and eighty graduate students. But it teaches nearly a thousand undergraduates each year, many of them premedical students and engineers. The postdoctoral research group grew from only a few in 1950 to over sixty in 1974. The current faculty, composed of ex-GILBERT CHINARD 95 perienced young men and distin\u00ad guished older chemists, has a variety of interests. Whereas the group associ\u00ad ated with Dean Taylor were most active in physical chemistry, a major new area of strength is now in organic and organometallic chemistry. Of the senior faculty, Professors Kurt Mislow, Edward Taylor, and Maitland Jones, Jr., are synthesizing new organic molecules, some mirror images of one another, some containing foreign atoms of sulfur, silicone, phosphorus, or thal\u00ad lium; and still others with unusual ring arrangements or special configurations to reveal significant functional groups. The physical chemists, Professors John Turkevich, Walter Kauzmann, Leland Allen, Donald McClure, Victor Laurie, and Robert Naumann, are investigating the nature and strengths of chemical bonds, submicroscopic molecular ar\u00ad rangements, catalytic efiFects, electronic and photochemical processes, proteins, and nuclear transmutations. Modern instruments in the Frick Laboratory include numerous spec\u00ad trometers (infrared, ultraviolet, micro\u00ad wave, Raman, and laser-Raman beams); also Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Electron Spin Resonance, and gas chromatographic, molecular beam, electron-microscope, mass spectrome\u00ad ter, and x-ray instruments. A variety of advanced computers are kept busy in\u00ad terpreting data, or suggesting novel methods for synthesizing new mole\u00ad cules. From the researches of these chemists, their colleagues, and their students, there will doubtless issue, to return to the words of Dean Taylor, . . . new findings, new discoveries, new ideas . . . to keep bright the tradition of progress in scientific truth which Maclean initiated at Princeton. Hubert N. Alyea Chinard, Gilbert (1881-1972), first permanent Meredith Howland Pyne Professor of French Literature and a leading authority on Franco-American relations, was born in France and trained at the University of Bordeaux and the Sorbonne. He came to the United States in 1908 and taught at Brown, the University of California, and Johns Hopkins before joining the Princeton faculty in 1937. He occupied the Pyne chair until his retirement in 1950 and continued to live in Princeton until his death shortly after his ninetieth birthday. His Thomas Jefferson, The Apostle of Americanism (1929) and his Honest John Adams (1933) were acclaimed by critics as the most readable one-volume biographies of their subjects. Another major work was his L Apotheosis de Benjamin Franklin, published in Paris in 1955. He wrote and edited more than forty books and published almost two hundred articles and reviews, mostly on Chateaubriand, Thomas Jef\u00ad ferson, and Frenchmen in America. He sent a copy of the bibliography of his writings that appeared in the Library Chronicle in 1965 to a former student inscribed: \"en souvenir dun demisiecle de vagabondage litteraire.\" The a colleague later expressed well Chinard's characteris\u00ad tics as a scholar: \"the extensiveness of his interests, the richness of his knowl\u00ad edge, the alertness of his imagination . . . the ease and grace with which he achieved new and lively insights. What he collected in his intellectual wander\u00ad ings in the history of France and the United States will stand at the top of all 96 THE INDEX OF CHRISTIAN ART research in Franco-American rela\u00ad tions.\" His associates found him \"a man of great conviction, courage, and integ\u00ad rity, with a . . . keen wit and They liked to recall his characteris\u00ad tically modest \"I discovered it tout a fait par hasard,\" which, one of them said, \"always announced a wondrously pro\u00ad ductive chance.\" Chinard was accorded signal honors both in America and in France. He was president of the Modern Language As\u00ad sociation of America, a member of the American Philosophical Society, a fel\u00ad low of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a commander of the Legion of Honor, and a laureate of the French Academy. He was awarded Princeton's honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters in 1959. Christian Art, The Index of, in McCormick Hall records all known works of Christian art produced before 1400. Originated by Professor Charles Rufus Morey (q.v.) in 1917 with a shoebox full of file cards, the Index has grown to a collection of 100,000 photo\u00ad graphs of works of art and a file of over 500,000 cards, which catalogue and analyze iconographically these art works. The Index has expedited and clari\u00ad fied scholarly investigations, earning a reputation as an incomparable human\u00ad istic research tool for medieval scholars as well as art historians. For example: A scholar cataloguing a European museum collection, anxious to date a cross holding the key to identification of other objects, wrote to the Christian Art Index as well as to the director of another museum, reputed to have a similar cross. The museum director confirmed the likeness of the crosses, supplied a date, and expressed surprise at the inquiry\u2014he had thought his the only existing one of its kind. The Princeton Index, however, sent the scholar photostatic reproductions of seven other crosses, similar in all essen\u00ad tial details, and cited a publication that convincingly dated the execution two centuries earlier than the museum di\u00ad rector had. Alison Smith MacDonald did the first formal cataloguing from 1918 to 1920. Phila Calder Nye, director from 1920 to 1933, kept the project going, when funds were lacking, with voluntary as\u00ad sistance from nine women (known as the Nine Muses). In the twenties the Index acquired an endowment of $200,000; in the thirties its resources were further increased by expendable gifts of $156,000. Helen Woodruff, di\u00ad rector from 1933 to 1942, worked out the form for recording descriptive and bibliographical information that has been the Index's hallmark ever since. William L. M. Rurke was director from 1942 to 1951. Rosalie B. Green suc\u00ad ceeded him in 1951. So helpful has the Index been in sav\u00ad ing scholars hours\u2014even weeks or months\u2014of research time, that four complete copies have been made avail\u00ad able elsewhere: at Dumbarton Oaks in Washington, D. C. (1940), at the Vati\u00ad can (1951), at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands (1962), at the Uni\u00ad versity of California, Los Angeles (1964). Martha Lou Stohlman Christian Student, The, was the name undergraduates gave a statue that stood on the lawn just south of Pyne Library, diagonally across from Murray-Dodge Hall, in the years immediately before and after World War I. The life-size bronze statue, depicting an under-CIVIL ENGINEERING 97 graduate in football uniform, an aca\u00ad demic gown slung over his shoulder, a pile of books in his left arm, was a memorial likeness of W. Earl Dodge 1879, leader of a group of students who formed the Intercollegiate Y.M.C. A. in 1876 in nearby East College (q.v.). Remembered by his classmates as \"79's great hero of college days,\" captain of the championship football team, presi\u00ad dent of the student religious organiza\u00ad tion, the Philadelphian Society, an honor student who graduated near the top of his class, Earl Dodge died sud\u00ad denly at the age of twenty-five. The statue was given by his brother Cleve\u00ad land H. Dodge 1879. The \"Christian Student\" was the work of Daniel Chester French, who also did the figures of Joseph Henry and Benjamin Franklin flanking the en\u00ad trance to Palmer Hall, and John Har\u00ad vard in Cambridge, Alma Mater at Co\u00ad lumbia, and Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial at Washington, D. C. Erected in 1913, the statue was twice torn down: the first time in 1929 by some seniors during a spree the night of Commencement; the second time in 1930 as one of several episodes during a riot that grew out of a football rally (those found chiefly responsible were expelled for a year). The second time it was torn down, the statue was put in storage; it was later placed on perma\u00ad nent loan at Stockbridge, Mas\u00ad sachusetts, in the Daniel Chester French Museum, which was sub\u00ad sequently turned over to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Civil Engineering, the oldest kind of non-military engineering\u2014it was so named to differentiate it from the mili\u00ad tary variety\u2014was first taught at Princeton in 1875 by Charles McMillan (q.v.), the first engineering professor in the newly established John C. Green School of Science, and the founder of the department that the Princeton En\u00ad gineer many years later called \"the granddad of the of Engineer\u00ad ing.\" McMillan educated the earliest gen\u00ad eration of Princeton civil engineers single-handedly, but as enrollment grew, additional appointments were needed, and within fifteen years he had been joined by three others who were to follow life-long careers in the de\u00ad partment. Frederick Newton Willson, like McMillan a graduate of Rensse\u00ad laer, organized the department's work in graphics in 1880 and taught that subject for forty-three years; much in\u00ad terested in the construction of bridges, he celebrated his eightieth birthday on the catwalk atop one of the towers of the Golden Gate bridge. One of Mc\u00ad Millan's first four students, Herbert Stearns Squier Smith (known to gener\u00ad ations of students as H2S Smith) taught applied mechanics, water supply, and hydraulics for forty years; he was secre\u00ad tary of the civil engineering faculty for most of his career (and secretary of the Princeton Class of 1878 for sixty-two years). Another McMillan student, Walter Butler Harris 1886 (who, while still an undergraduate, designed and built the first jetty on the Atlantic coast), taught railroad engineering and surveying for forty-five years and by the time of his retirement in 1934 had left his mark by laying out a large part of the newer University campus and de\u00ad signing twenty-five faculty houses in the Broadmead area. Charles McMillan retired in 1914 and was succeeded as chairman by Frank H. Constant, who served until 1937. The year of McMillan's retire\u00ad ment also marked the arrival of George E. Beggs (q.v.) who became interna-98 CIVIL ENGINEERING tionally known for his pioneering work in the model analysis of bridges and other structures. Beggs was the mainstay of the departmental program in struc\u00ad tural engineering, which was further strengthened in the late thirties and early forties by the addition of Gregory P. Tschebotarioff in soil mechanics and Hans F. Winterkorn in soil physics. Beggs followed Constant as chair\u00ad man, serving for two years until his death in 1939. He was succeeded by Philip Kissam (1939 to 1946) and Elmer K. Timby, who resigned in 1949 to enter private practice. Like his old teacher Professor Harris, Kissam initi\u00ad ated hundreds of undergraduates into the techniques of surveying during his forty-four years in the department. The chairman from 1950 to 1961 was W. Mack Angas, who, as a vice-admiral in the United States Navy, had supervised the construction of sixteen bases by the \"seabees\" in the Southwest Pacific dur\u00ad ing World War II, and who, at Princeton, founded the department's River and Harbor Program, which flourished during the fifties and sixties. A change in the departmental struc\u00ad ture came in 1966, when the depart\u00ad ment merged with the geological en\u00ad gineering department, which had been founded in 1922 and had been particu\u00ad larly strong during the fourteen-year chairmanship (1940-1955) of Blair Pro\u00ad fessor of Geology W. Taylor Thorn, Jr. The Department of Civil and Geo\u00ad logical Engineering, which resulted from the merger, continued until 1974, when geological engineering became a program within the Department of Civil Engineering under the direction of William E. Bonini (a member of both the civil engineering and the geological and geophysical sciences departments). Another interdepartmental plan of study brought under the aegis of the department at this time was the Basic Engineering Program, first instituted in 1938 by Kenneth Condit to meet the needs of students wishing to prepare for administrative and economic phases of an engineering career in industry or government. Most recently, basic en\u00ad gineering has been supervised by Howard Menand, Jr. (director from 1964 until his retirement in 1977), and since 1977 by P. Michael Lion, chair\u00ad man of the interdepartmental commit\u00ad tee in charge of the program. Norman Sollenberger's ten-year chairmanship (1961-1971) was marked by substantial expansion of the depart\u00ad ment's Ph.D. program and the re\u00ad cruitment of new faculty, reinforcing Princeton's strong tradition in struc\u00ad tural engineering while developing a new theoretical undergirding in me\u00ad chanics. Those added in structural engineer\u00ad ing included Robert H. Scanlan (an au\u00ad thority on vibrations and structural dynamics), David P. Billington (thin shell concrete structures), and Robert Mark (experimental stress analysis). Billington and Mark, who also teach in the School of Architecture and Urban Planning, have been particularly con\u00ad cerned with developing fruitful rela\u00ad tions gineering teaching volving, for example, structures of his\u00ad torical and cultural interest such as bridges and Gothic cathedrals. Increased strength was brought to the department's research and instruc\u00ad tion in mechanics\u2014the other part of its current graduate program in structures and mechanics\u2014by the addition of Ahmet S. Cakmak (a specialist in the mechanics of materials), Peter C. Y. Lee (elasticity theory), and, later, A. Cemal Eringen (theory of mixtures). CLASS OF 1912 PAVILION 99 Another addition to the department under Sollenberger's chairmanship was J. Stuart Hunter, a specialist in the use of statistical methods for problem solv\u00ad ing and decision making in engineer\u00ad ing, and also a leader in the Basic En\u00ad gineering Program. Under Professor Cakmak, who be\u00ad came chairman in 1971, the depart\u00ad ment gave special attention to strengthening the Program in Water Resources and to the development of a new Transportation Program. Jointly sponsored since the early sixties by the Departments of Civil Engineering and Geological and Geophysical Sciences to contribute to the solution of \"the in\u00ad creasingly acute water resources prob\u00ad lem attending world population growth,\" the Water Resources Pro\u00ad gram was revitalized in the seventies under William E. Bonini and later, George F. Pinder, who came to the de\u00ad partment from the United States Geo\u00ad logical Survey. The Transportation Program was or\u00ad ganized in 1972 under the aegis of the civil engineering department as a mul- tidisciplinary project involving faculty and students from the School of En\u00ad gineering and Applied Science, the School of Architecture and Urban Planning, and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Af\u00ad fairs. Directed by Civil Engineering Professor P. Michael Lion, the program has generated a considerable amount of original research, with both student and faculty involvement in a number of outside projects, among them an assessment of transit alternatives for Trenton, commissioned by that city, and an analysis of the Conrail system and its potential as a profit-making ven\u00ad ture, commissioned by Congress. More recently, under the direction of Alain L. Kornhauser, the program has ex\u00adplored ways of increasing the produc\u00ad tivity of the railroads in cooperation with shippers, rail management and labor, and the federal government. In the seventies the Department of Civil Engineering experienced a sub\u00ad stantial rise in enrollment\u2014an increase Professor Cakmak attributed to the de\u00ad partment's efforts to make its programs relevant to contemporary life and at\u00ad tractive to students interested \"in ap\u00ad plying their technical knowledge to ac\u00ad tual problems of social concern.\" By 1976-1977 Civil Engineering had risen to fifth place among the thirty-two de\u00ad partments of instruction in the number of undergraduate majors, surpassed only by the traditional leaders, History, English, Economics, and Politics. As it passed its hundredth birthday, the \"granddad\" of Princeton engineer\u00ad ing appeared quite spry, and not only able but eager to adjust to the times and to join with other disciplines\u2014 some younger, some older\u2014in the search for solutions to contemporary problems. Class of 1912 Pavilion was given by that class in 1965 \"in memory of Sanford B. White [1888-1964] beloved class presi\u00ad dent for many years and one of Princeton's great athletes.\" Designed by Eldredge Snyder '22, the Pavilion stands between the Pardee and Gulick playing fields south of Guyot Hall, its orange, black, and white striped roof topped by two 1912 pennant weather vanes. Sanford White was an All-American end who was chiefly responsible for Princeton's winning the Big Three football championship in his senior year. In the Harvard game he picked up a fumble and ran ninety yards for a touchdown and later tackled an oppos\u00ad ing runner behind his goal line for a 100 CLASSICS safety to give Princeton an 8 to 6 vic\u00ad tory. A week later he recovered a fum\u00ad ble and ran seventy yards for a touchdown to achieve a 6 to 3 victory over Yale. White also played a big part in Princetons Big Three baseball championships of 1910, 1911, and 1912 as shortstop and cleanup man in the batting order. Against Yale in 1912, he scored five runs, pulled down a line drive and took part in two double plays. In later life White was secretary of the International Harvester Company in Chicago. Classics at Princeton is coeval with the College itself. The first of the rules drawn up by President Aaron Burr in 1748 went as follows: None may expect to be admitted into College but such as being examined by the President and Tutors shall be found able to render Virgil and TuI- ly's Orations into English; and to turn English into true and grammati\u00ad cal Latin; and to be so well ac\u00ad quainted with the Greek as to render any part of the four Evangelists in that language into Latin or English; and to give the grammatical connex\u00ad ion of the words. The emphasis on classics in eight\u00ad eenth-century education at Princeton \u2014and its diurnal rigor\u2014is well set forth in a letter dated February 13, 1750, from freshman Joseph Shippen of Phil\u00ad adelphia to his father: \"But I must give you an account of my studies at the present time. At seven in the morning we recite to the President lessons in the works of Xenophon in Greek, and in Watt's Ontology.' The rest of the morn\u00ad ing, until dinner time, we study Cicero de Oratore and the Hebrew Gram\u00ad mar.\" Throughout the nineteenth century, classical studies, like the College, flourished Dei sub Numine. Of the twenty or more professors, adjunct pro\u00ad fessors, and senior tutors who taught the subject, nine were Doctors of Di\u00ad vinity, and (a further sign of grace) thir\u00ad teen were College of New Jersey Bachelors of Arts. In the first half of the century there was only one Ph. D. (from Gottingen); in the last half there were relatively many. Princeton was moving toward university status. As early as 1869 a fellowship had been established for advanced study in classics. Prominent classicists in the 1880s were Samuel R. Winans, Andrew Fleming West, and John H. Westcott. The history of the modern department begins with these three. Winans, a fu\u00ad ture dean of the faculty, became Pro\u00ad fessor of Greek in 1883; West, Profes\u00ad sor of Latin in 1883 and Professor of Pedagogics in 1885. Westcott became Professor of Latin in 1889. Later, as head of the department under Wood- row Wilson, Westcott guided it to prominence with excellent appoint\u00ad ments of numerous young men of great promise, many of whom became distin\u00ad guished scholars: William Kelly Pren\u00ad tice (1900) in Greek history, epigra\u00ad phy, and archaeology; David Magie (1905) in Roman history; Duane R. Stuart (1905) in Latin literature and an\u00ad cient biography. West, raconteur par excellence, persuader supreme of pow\u00ad erful alumni, was already head of the Graduate School when Wilson became president of the University. Their clash over the location of the Graduate Col\u00ad lege reverberated for many years. In 1907 Frank Frost Abbott and Edward Capps were called from the University of Chicago. Abbott gave strength in Roman historical studies and Capps brought renown in Greek drama, epig\u00ad raphy, and archaeology. Capps was also CLASSICS 101 a man of affairs: American Red Cross commissioner in Greece 1918-19; United States Minister to Greece 1920-22; organizer of the American ex\u00ad cavation of the Athenian Agora begun in 1930 under Professor T. Leslie Shear. In 1912, the year John Grier Hibben became president, Allen Chester John\u00ad son joined the faculty. He was a Ro\u00ad man historian and an outstanding papyrologist, cataloguer of the Greek papyri in the Princeton collection, and editor of the Princeton studies in papyrology. In 1919, the department gained Paul Coleman-Norton in Roman studies and Shirley Weber in Greek studies; Weber left in 1940 to become librarian of the Gennadeion of the American School in Athens. The first quarter of the twentieth century was a time of national prestige for the department and of its greatest power within the University. Even as late as 1929, all Liberal Arts freshmen (400 of them) had to offer four years of Latin for admission and take a fifth year in college\u2014vestiges of a fading educa\u00ad tional elitism, it has been said. In 1930 the requirement was abolished; Clas\u00ad sics ceased being a vested interest and thus gained freedom to prosper on its own merits. In 1927, Arthur L. Wheeler, spe\u00ad cialist in Roman drama, was called from Bryn Mawr to take over the chairman\u00ad ship of the department from Capps. He was succeeded in 1932 by Duane R. Stuart. The late twenties and the thirties brought judicious appointments such as those of Whitney J. Oates, Greek phi\u00ad losophy, founder of the Special Pro\u00ad gram in the Humanities and of the Council of the Humanities, originator of the idea of the Woodrow Wilson Fel\u00ad lowship Program; Francis R. B. Godol- phin, literary criticism, Roman elegy, English literature and the Classics; John V.A. Fine, Greek history, mentor of graduate students; George E. Duckworth, Roman drama and ancient epic. Under their guidance the de\u00ad partment emphasized the development of \"service\" courses that made avail\u00ad able, in translation, the values and ideas embodied in the classics. While the concentrators became fewer, those who made significant, meaningful con\u00ad tact with classical culture became far more numerous. After World War II Godolphin be\u00ad came dean of the college and Oates be\u00ad came chairman of the department. In the following years there were added to the staff Anthony Raubitschek, Greek studies; Frank C. Bourne, Roman his\u00ad tory and law; Robert D. Murray, Greek tragedy and lyric poetry; Robert F. Go- heen (later president of Princeton) Greek drama; and James I. Armstrong (who not much later became president of Middlebury College) Homeric studies. In the fifties, and most of the sixties, departmental graduate studies flourished. Under the leadership of Erik Sjoqvist and Richard Stillwell of Art and Archaeology the Program in Classical Archaeology, enthusiastically supported by the department, grew strong. The department made new affiliations on the graduate level with linguistics, philosophy, and compara\u00ad tive literature. Close ties were main\u00ad tained with Classics at the Institute for Advanced Study; many of its members, such as Harold Cherniss in Greek phi\u00ad losophy, Benjamin Meritt in Greek epigraphy, and Homer Thompson in archaeology, contributed seminars in various years. Princeton became, and still remains, a world center for classical studies. In 1961 Samuel D. Atkins, whose field is Indo-European and classical lin-102 GROVER CLEVELAND guistics, succeeded to the chairman\u00ad ship. A new generation moved to ten\u00ad ure in this decade. David Furley was called from the University of London to help run the Program in Classical Phi\u00ad losophy. Arthur Hanson, Latin litera\u00ad ture, and W. Robert Connor, Greek history, came from the University of Michigan. T. James Luce was added in Roman studies, John Keaney in Greek studies, and Bernard Fenik in Homeric studies. The department survived the generation gap, student alienation, and proliferating permissiveness. A brave new world started in the seventies. With the advent of coeduca\u00ad tion, the University enrollment was larger \"and so too was the department's. Ann L. Bergren, Lois V. Hinckley, Janet M. Martin, and Carroll Moulton were added at the Junior level. Janet Martin's subsequent promotion to As\u00ad sociate Professor made her the first woman to attain tenure rank in the de\u00ad partment. Edward J. Champlin and James E. Zetzel later joined the junior staff, and Froma I. Zeitlin came as As\u00ad sociate Professor. Interest flourished in medieval studies and in comparative literature, and the graduate program remained healthy despite severe pres\u00ad sures on academic hiring. Under the able leadership of W. Robert Connor, chairman from 1972 to 1977, the de\u00ad partment maintained its national pro\u00ad file. T. James Luce became chairman in 1977. Always keeping in mind the Greek admonitions meden agan (noth\u00ad ing in excess!) and euphemeite (speak with silence!), one may, with caution, say that the future appears promising. Samuel D. Atkins Cleveland, Grover (1837-1908) and his wife first visited Princeton in October 1896, when he made an address at the Sesquicentennial Celebration. At that time, too, began his friendship with Andrew Fleming West, the chief organ\u00ad izer of the celebration, who was later to be dean of the graduate school. The Clevelands liked Princeton so much they decided to live here at the close of his second term as president. With Pro\u00ad fessor West's help, Cleveland arranged for the purchase of a colonial mansion surrounded by spacious grounds at 15 Hodge Road which he named \"West- land.\" The Clevelands moved into West- land in March 1897, and soon took a central place of honor and affection in the community. During their visit at the Sesquicentennial they had re\u00ad viewed a torchlight procession of alumni and students from the steps of Nassau Hall; one of the signs the un\u00ad dergraduates carried read \"Grover, send your boys to Princeton.\" This invi\u00ad tation was somewhat premature since the three Cleveland children were all girls. But the next fall, the Clevelands' first son, Richard Folsom, was born, and the undergraduates welcomed his arrival with an oracular announcement, on the campus bulletin board, that he would enter Princeton with the Class of 1919 and play center on a cham\u00ad pionship football team all four years.* Westland became the mecca for un\u00ad dergraduate processions after triumphs in athletics or debating or other times of student jubilation. Cleveland would come out on the porch and respond with a few pleasant words and some\u00ad times even lead a locomotive cheer. The students paraded to his house every March 18th to cheer him on his birthday and when he reached seventy gave him a silver loving cup, which Pro\u00ad fessor John Grier Hibben presented on their behalf. \"I feel young at seventy,\" Cleveland told them, \"because I have GROVER CLEVELAND 103 here breathed the atmosphere of vigor\u00ad ous youth.\" The ex-president made many ac\u00ad quaintances and some close friends in the faculty. West was the closest and was a frequent caller at Westland. Hib- ben also went there often. Paul van Dyke, the historian, was Cleveland's favorite hunting and fishing compan\u00ad ion. Cleveland befriended John Finley when he came to Princeton as professor of politics, and built a house for his use in a corner of his spacious grounds. Years later Finley recalled that, as the house was nearing completion, he had discovered water in the cellar. When he felt obliged to mention it Cleveland replied, \"Well, my dear fellow, what did you expect, champagne?\" Cleve\u00ad land once heard Woodrow Wilson read Wordsworth's \"Character of the Happy Warrior,\" and it became his favorite poem. Cleveland presided at Princeton- Yale debates and other campus meet\u00ad ings, and at Commencement each year walked at the head of the academic procession at the side of the president of the university. In 1899 Henry Staf\u00ad ford Little, of the Class of 1844, founded a public lectureship, stipulat\u00ad ing that Cleveland should be its incum\u00ad bent as long as he lived. Cleveland ac\u00ad cepted and lectured once or twice each year before capacity audiences in Alex\u00ad ander Hall on such subjects as \"The In\u00ad dependence of the Executive,\" \"The Venezuelan Boundary Controversy,\" \"Government in the Chicago Strike.\" In the fall of 1901 Cleveland was elected a trustee and thereafter took an active part in University affairs until his death. He thought it \"a serious thing to be a trustee of Princeton\" and gave painstaking attention to all the details of the operation of the University that came before the board. He spoke for the trustees at Woodrow Wilson's inau\u00ad guration in 1902 and at the dedication of the Faculty Room in Nassau Hall in 1906. In 1904 he was appointed chair\u00ad man of the trustees' committee on the graduate school and became a staunch advocate of the plan for its develop\u00ad ment; he wrote a fellow trustee that it was \"laying the foundation of Prince\u00ad ton's largest element of future great\u00ad ness.\" He sided with Dean West in his dispute with Woodrow Wilson about the location of the graduate college. Cleveland also opposed Wilson's quad plan, in part because he feared it would delay realization of the graduate col\u00ad lege. He sought to influence Andrew Carnegie to contribute to the universi\u00ad ty's endowment and it was during one of Carnegie's visits to Westland that the scheme of creating a lake for Princeton was first broached. Cleveland died at Westland on June 24, 1908. The simple funeral services at the house, attended by the family, President Roosevelt, others eminent in the government, and Princeton friends, closed with Henry van Dyke's reading of \"The Happy Warrior.\" (\"Who com\u00ad prehends his trust, and to the same I Keeps faithful with a singleness of aim.\") He was buried in the Princeton cemetery. Woodrow Wilson wrote in his Presi\u00ad dent's Report that the trustees had felt the power of Cleveland's character in all their deliberations, that \"there was an unmistakable tonic in mere associa\u00ad tion with him. . . . He did much more than give the prestige of his great name to the university: he served it with thoughtful intelligence and conscien\u00ad tious devotion.\" Cleveland's association with Prince\u00ad ton is commemorated by the Cleveland Tower of the Graduate College, erected in 1913 by popular subscrip-104 CLIO HALL tion\u2014\"a tower of strength and beauty,\" ex-President Taft said at its dedication, \"and most expressive of his character.\" * This prophecy was fulfilled in part. Richard Cleveland did enter, and did graduate, with the Class of 1919. But he played football only one year\u2014he was fullback on his freshman team which beat the Yale freshmen\u2014and thereafter concentrated on track. However, his son, Thomas Grover Cleveland '49, was a varsity guard for three years, in two of which the team beat Har\u00ad vard and Yale. Clio Hall, originally the home of the Cliosophic Society, was built in 1893 at the same time as its identical neighbor, Whig Hall (q.v.). After the Cliosophic Society merged with the American Whig Society in 1929 to form what is commonly known as Whig-Clio, Clio was used for a variety of purposes and became for a time the home of the De\u00ad partment of Music. In 1963, on the completion of the Woolworth Center for Musical Studies, the building's inte\u00ad rior was renovated, and it has since been used by Personnel Services and later also by Career Services. Coffin, Robert P. Tristram (1892- 1955), poet, novelist, and essayist, earned an A.M. at Princeton after graduating from Bowdoin in 1915 and before going to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. Two of his poems appeared in a selection of Princeton verse published by Princeton University Press in 1916 and thirteen in another Princeton an\u00ad thology published by the Press in 1919. While teaching at Wells College and Bowdoin College, Coffin wrote thirty- seven books\u2014poems, novels, biog\u00ad raphies, and essays. His Strange Holi\u00ad ness won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1935. College and University Founders. Princeton graduates have been found\u00ad ers or first presidents of the following institutions: AUSTIN COLLEGE, Sherman, Texas Daniel Baker 1815 was chiefly re\u00ad sponsible for securing its charter in 1849 and was its president from 1853 to 1857. The trustees proposed naming the college for him, but he declined the honor. BROWN UNIVERSITY, Providence, Rhode Island (1764) James Manning 1762 was its first president, David Howell 1766 its first tutor, Nassau Hall the model for its first building, and Princeton the source of its original course of study and customs. DICKINSON COLLEGE, Carlisle, Pennsylvania Begun as a school in 1773, it was chartered as a college in 1783. Benja\u00ad min Rush 1760 was chiefly responsible for securing the charter, for naming the college after his fellow patriot, John Dickinson, and for bringing its first president from Scotland. A century and a half later, in 1933, the college hon\u00ad ored him by naming a large addition to its grounds, the Benjamin Rush Cam\u00ad pus. HAMILTON COLLEGE, Clinton, New York The Rev. Samuel Kirkland 1765, missionary to the Oneida Indians, in 1793, with the help of Alexander Hamilton, founded the Hamilton Oneida Academy which in 1812 was re\u00ad organized as Hamilton College. HAMPDEN-SYDNEY COLLEGE, Hampden-Sydney, Va. In 1776 the Rev. Samuel Stanhope Smith 1769 founded and became first rector of Hampden-Sydney Academy, COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY FOUNDERS 105 which was chartered as a college in 1783. When he returned to Princeton as professor of moral philosophy in 1779, his brother John Blair Smith 1773 succeeded him as president. Five of the original trustees were Princeton grad\u00ad uates, among them James Madison 1771. HOBART COLLEGE, Geneva, New York John Henry Hobart 1793, Protestant Episcopal Bishop of New York, led a movement in 1822 to reorganize Geneva Academy, begun in 1796, as Geneva College. In 1852 the College was renamed in his honor. UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA, Chapel Hill, N.C. William Richardson Davie 1776 is called \"the Father of the University.\" In 1789 as a member of the state legisla\u00ad ture he drafted and introduced the bill that established \"the first state univer\u00ad sity in the United States to open its doors to students.\" Later he was chiefly responsible for locating the university and providing for its future develop\u00ad ment. Joseph Caldwell 1791 was the first president. Two academic buildings across the street from each other are named for Davie and Caldwell. Caldwell is also memorialized by a shaft of marble in the center of the North Quadrangle. An old poplar tree under which, according to legend, Davie and his associates rested after surveying many sites and there decided to locate the University in Chapel Hill, is called the Davie Poplar. OHIO UNIVERSITY, Athens, Ohio Chartered in 1804, opened in 1808. The Rev. Jacob Lindly 1800 was the first member of its faculty and adminis\u00ad tered its affairs until 1822. The Col\u00ad lege's first two buildings were erected under his direction; one of them, ac\u00adcording to tradition, was patterned after Nassau Hall. A college hall of more recent construction is named for him. TRANSYLVANIA COLLEGE, Lexington, Kentucky The Rev. John Todd 1749 and the Rev. Caleb Wallace 1770 were influen\u00ad tial in securing a charter and endow\u00ad ment for Transylvania Seminary in 1783, and David Rice 1761 was the first chairman of its trustees. It became Transylvania University in 1798; since 1915 it has been called a college. TUSCULUM COLLEGE, Greenville, Tennessee The Rev. Hezekiah Balch 1766 was the first president of Greenville Col\u00ad lege in 1794. The Rev. Samuel Doak 1775 founded Tusculum Academy, later chartered as Tusculum College, in 1819. After the Civil War, the two col\u00ad leges united and came to be known as Tusculum College. UNION COLLEGE, Schenectady, New York The Rev. Dirck Romeyn 1765 pro\u00ad vided the leadership for the founding of Schenectady Academy in 1785 and for its reorganization as Union College in 1795. John Blair Smith 1773 was the first president of the college. UNITED NATIONS UNIVERSITY, Tokyo, Japan James M. Hester '46, who served as president of New York University from 1962 to 1975, became rector of the United Nations University at its found\u00ad ing in September 1975. WASHINGTON AND JEFFERSON COLLEGE, Washington, Pa. The Rev. John MacMillan 1772 and the Rev. Thaddeus Dod 1773 founded Washington Academy, later chartered 106 COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS as Washington College, in 1787. The Rev. John Watson 1797 was first presi\u00ad dent of Jefferson College (1802). The two colleges united in 1865. WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY, Lexington, Va. Begun in 1749 as Augusta Academy, it was called Liberty Hall in 1776, Lib\u00ad erty Hall Academy in 1782, Washing\u00ad ton Academy (following a gift from George Washington) in 1798, Washing\u00ad ton College in 1813, and Washington and Lee University (following Robert E. Lee's presidency) in 1871. The Rev. William Graham 1773, a Princeton classmate and friend of Light-Horse Harry Lee, was in charge of the institu\u00ad tion from 1774 to 1796 and its first pres\u00ad ident after its incorporation. \"To his ex\u00ad ertions, more than to those of any other one man,\" Henry Howe wrote in His\u00ad torical Collections of Virginia (1845), \"the institution owes its establishment, and its continuance during . . . trou\u00ad blous times.\" College and University Presidents. Colleges and universities that have been headed by presidents who at\u00ad tended Princeton number more than a hundred, in thirty-six states from Ala\u00ad bama to Washington, and in seven foreign countries: China, Egypt, Greece, India, Lebanon, Pakistan, and Turkey.

Havens '25 (1936-1970) College of New Jersey was Princeton's legal name during its first one hundred and fifty years. But the College was usually referred to as Nassau or Nassau Hall or Princeton College after it moved to Princeton in 1756. In the 1860s the College baseball team used the name \"Nassau\"; starting in 1870 all athletic teams were designated \"Prince\u00ad ton.\" On October 22, 1896, the anni\u00adversary of the signing of the College's first charter, at the climax of the Ses- quicentennial Celebration, President Patton announced that \"from this mo\u00ad ment what heretofore for one hundred and fifty years has been known as the College of New Jersey shall in all future time be known as Princeton Univer\u00ad sity.\" Collins, Varnum Lansing (1870-1936), who is gratefully remembered for his research and writing in Princeton his\u00ad tory, was graduated from Princeton in 1892. In college he was the leader of the Glee Club, chairman of the Bric- a-Brac, and an editor of the Nassau Lit. He served his Alma Mater as reference librarian, preceptor, professor of French, clerk of the faculty, and, fi\u00ad nally, as Secretary of the University from 1917 until his death in 1936. Collins wrote an account of the Con\u00ad tinental Congress at Princeton (1908), a history of the University (1914), a guide to the campus and the town (1919), and a two-volume biography of John With- erspoon (1925). \"More than any other person,\" the Alumni Weekly said when he died, \"he has given us a sense of Princeton's living continuity.\" Colors. Princeton's orange and black came into use soon after the Civil War. On April 5, 1866, a freshman named George K. Ward 1869 observed at a class meeting that many other colleges had their distinctive colors but Prince\u00ad ton had none, and he suggested that orange would be appropriate since Wil\u00ad liam III of the House of Nassau, in whose honor the first building had been named, was also Prince of Orange. His suggestion met with instant favor with his classmates but failed to win general approval in the other classes. Ward persisted, however, and a little over a COLORS 109 year later, on June 26, 1867, when his teammates in the Class of 1869 Base Ball Club assembled at Princeton Junc\u00ad tion for their trip to New Haven to play the Yale Class of 1869, he provided them all with badges of orange ribbon with \" '69 B.B.C.\" printed on them in black ink. It proved an auspicious occa\u00ad sion for the first recorded use of Princeton's colors. Sporting their badges, the team had a pleasant trip by train to New York and overnight on the steamer \"Elm City\" up Long Island Sound to New Haven; heard a speech by President Andrew Johnson who was making a tour of New England and happened to be in New Haven; came from behind with two runs in the ninth inning to win, 19 to 18; and, still wear\u00ad ing their badges, had supper with their Yale opponents at a New Haven hotel where the Yale players magnanimously sang \"Oh, here's to Nassau Hall I For she's bully at baseball!\" More general and formal use of Princeton's colors came a year later. In response to a petition from all four un\u00ad dergraduate classes, the Faculty on Oc\u00ad tober 12, 1868 resolved to permit stu\u00ad dents \"to adopt and wear as the College Badge an orange colored Ribbon bear\u00ad ing upon it the word 'Princeton.' \" Two weeks later at the inauguration of James McCosh as eleventh president of the College, such badges, arranged for by the Class of 1869, were much in evi\u00ad dence and the use of orange (with black printing) became official. The combination of orange and black was accidental and the two colors were not associated in the undergraduates' minds until the fall of 1873 when a freshman named William Libbey, Jr., 1877, on a dare from his classmate, Melancthon W. Jacobus, sported a necktie made of yellow and black silk which he had seen advertised in Cam\u00adbridge, England, the preceding sum\u00ad mer, as \"The Duke of Nassau's colors.\" His wearing of the necktie was used as evidence to prove Princeton's prior right to the colors to a committee from Rutgers that had become interested in orange and black. The following spring, Libbey arranged through his father, a New York merchant, for the manufac\u00ad ture in a Paterson silk mill of a thousand yards of orange and black ribbon for use at an intercollegiate rowing regatta in Saratoga, N.Y., on July 15, 1874. He gave pieces of the ribbon to members of the freshman crew for hatbands and sent the remainder to a store in the Grand Union Hotel at Saratoga, three miles from the lake where the races were rowed, to be sold as \"Princeton's colors.\" When the Princeton freshmen won the first race, the Class of 1877 commissioned one of its members, who happened to have with him a very fast trotting horse, to hurry to the hotel to buy up all the ribbon, but by the time he arrived every inch had been sold. Thereafter orange and black ap\u00ad peared in the attire of athletic teams and in 1888 as the title of a song that soon won a place in Princeton lore. In 1896, the year of the Sesquicentennial, the trustees adopted orange and black as the official colors for academic gowns despite a plea by Professor Allan Mar- quand 1874 that Princeton's colors be changed to orange and blue, which he had discovered were the true colors of the House of Nassau (and of the Netherlands whence New York City gets its orange and blue). Professor Marquand made a strong case for his proposal, on aesthetic as well as histori\u00ad cal grounds, but by now too much sen\u00ad timent had been attached to the colors that had been in use for several decades to permit giving them up. \"It matters not whether we got them by accident 110 COMMENCEMENT or design,\" the feeling was said to run, \"We have them, and will never change them, so long as eye and voice can unite in praise of 'dear old Princeton and the Orange and the Black.' \" Commencement, the ceremony of con\u00ad ferring degrees, marks the end of the academic year, and the beginning of the careers of those graduating. As early as the fourteenth century, at Cambridge University, a student who had passed the requisite examinations was said to \"commence Bachelor of Arts (or Master or Doctor),\" and the occa\u00ad sion when he took his degree was called commencement. At Princeton's first commencement, held in 1748 in the Newark \"meeting\u00ad house'' of which President Aaron Burr Was pastor, seven persons took degrees: Jonathan Belcher (q.v.), royal governor of the Province of New Jersey, who was awarded an honorary master's degree, and six young men who had passed their examinations for the bachelor's degree. These few \"commencers\" were the objects of much oratory. At the morning exercises (one of the trustees reported in a New York newspaper), the clerk of the board read in extenso the 3700-word royal charter that Gov\u00ad ernor Belcher had granted the College. In the afternoon, President Burr deliv\u00ad ered from memory an \"elegant Oration in the Latin Tongue\" that lasted three quarters of an hour, and, after public disputations in Latin by the six candi\u00ad dates and the conferring of degrees, the student salutatorian spoke in Latin for half an hour, after which the president prayed in English and dismissed the as\u00ad sembly. These proceedings gave \"uni\u00ad versal Satisfaction, even the Unlearned being pleased with [their] Solemnity and Decorum.\" After the College moved to Prince\u00adton in 1756, commencement was held in the prayer hall in Nassau Hall until 1764 when more adequate space be\u00ad came available in the First Presbyterian Church's new building. Latin con\u00ad tinued to be the language of choice, but, according to contemporary news\u00ad paper accounts, the proceedings were enlivened by an occasional speech in English and by music. In 1760 Benja\u00ad min Rush (q.v.) \"in a very sprightly and entertaining Manner delivered an in\u00ad genious English Harangue in Praise of Oratory,\" and the graduating seniors sang two compositions by President Samuel Davies. Under President Witherspoon com\u00ad mencement took on a revolutionary flavor. In 1770 the entire graduating class wore American-made clothes, and in 1771 (when James\u00b7 Madison gradu\u00ad ated) Hugh Henry Brackenridge read a prophetic poem on \"The Rising Glory of America,\" which Philip Freneau and he had written. The commencement of 1783 was made memorable by the presence of George Washington and members of the Continental Congress, then meeting in Princeton. For almost a century, commence\u00ad ment took place in the fall. Coming at the end of the harvest season, the occa\u00ad sion became a public holiday for the en\u00ad tire countryside, and speakers at the exercises in the church (President John Maclean recalled) had to compete with the crowds on the street outside, \"drinking, fiddling and dancing, play\u00ad ing for pennies, and testing the speed of their horses.\" In 1844, on petition of the faculty, the trustees advanced commencement to June. Exercises continued to be held in the First Church until 1892, when Alexan\u00ad der Hall was completed. Alexander, in turn, was outgrown, and beginning in 1922 commencement was held in front DEPARTMENT OF COMPARATIVE LITERATURE 111 of Nassau Hall except when rain forced the ceremonies indoors. The modern commencement season lasts almost a week. Alumni begin re\u00ad turning for class reunions on the pre\u00ad ceding Wednesday, take part in faculty-alumni forums on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday morning, and the alumni parade (q.v.) on Saturday after\u00ad noon. Sunday is given over to the bac\u00ad calaureate service (q.v.) in the morn\u00ad ing, the president's garden party in the afternoon, and a band concert at night. Monday is devoted to class day exer\u00ad cises, departmental receptions for seniors and their families, and at night the senior promenade, held in recent years on the plaza between Jadwin and Fine Halls, with fireworks in nearby Palmer Stadium. Commencement exercises on Tues\u00ad day include an invocation, the singing of \"Faith of Our Fathers,\" the Latin salutatory (q.v.), the conferring of bachelor degrees, the recognition of honors graduates, the valedictory (q.v.), the conferring of master, doctor, and honorary degrees (q.v.), brief re\u00ad marks by the president, and the singing of \"Old Nassau.\" These ceremonies, lasting about an hour, follow an academic procession of trustees, faculty, and degree can\u00ad didates, wearing traditional cap, gown, and hood, brightened by the colors of Princeton and many other universities. They are directed by a dozen faculty marshals in orange silk gowns and black velvet da Vinci caps. Since 1896, when the college became a university, the chief marshal's baton has been wielded by William Libbey, Jr., V. Lansing Collins, Robert M. Scoon, E. Baldwin Smith, Robert W. McLaughlin, Jr., Richard Stillwell, ErI- ing Dorf, E. Dudley H. Johnson, Car\u00ad los H. Baker, and David R. Coffin. Comparative Literature, The De\u00ad partment of, has enjoyed a brief but substantial history at Princeton. The graduate program, which began under an interdepartmental committee in the Council of the Humanities in 1962, gathered a nucleus of four faculty members from 1966 to 1970 and emerged as an independent depart\u00ad ment in 1975. Its formation was re\u00ad quested by both graduate and under\u00ad graduate students, and strengthened by faculty members, who had taught comparative courses in other depart\u00ad ments of literature for several years. At present they form a faculty of fif\u00ad teen members\u2014thirteen full profes\u00ad sors, and two assistant professors supported by funds from the Mellon Foundation. In addition to English, the linguistic coverage of the department consists of the major European lan\u00ad guages^\u2014French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish, Latin and Classical Greek; Near and Far Eastern languages will be more effectively represented in the future. The historical range of the faculty leads from antiquity to the mod\u00ad ern period. The department offers an enlarged graduate program and undergraduate concentration in Comparative Litera\u00ad ture. The purpose of the graduate pro\u00ad gram is essentially to train new teachers in the field, that of the undergraduate program to provide a liberal, humaniz\u00ad ing discipline for the study of language and literature as a whole. In relation to the Humanities at Princeton, Compara\u00ad tive Literature draws on the specialities of surrounding departments and lends them broad, generalizing kinds of strength. All students are asked to major, in effect, in one literature, and so benefit from the other departments, their faculties and courses; their stu\u00ad dents, in turn, are invited to enroll in 112 THE COMPTON BROTHERS courses in Comparative Literature, forums where central literary issues, regardless of national boundaries, may be discussed. More specifically, the strengths of the department include the history, theory, and practice of literary criti\u00ad cism, the study of literary forms\u2014 particularly narrative forms, the epic and the novel\u2014the classical tradition and the main chronological periods, all considered from an international, in- tercultural, perspective. Robert Fagles Compton Brothers, The, were among the most illustrious alumni of the Princeton Graduate School. AU three graduated from the College of Wooster, where their father, a Presbyterian minister, was dean and professor of phi\u00ad losophy, and all three earned their Ph. D. s at Princeton. Karl T. Compton (1887-1954), who received his Ph.D. in 1912, was professor of physics and chairman of the department at Prince\u00ad ton, and later president and chairman of the corporation of Massachusetts In\u00ad stitute of Technology. Wilson M. Compton (1890-1967), who received his Ph.D. in 1915, taught economics, served the lumber industry and then the federal government as a specialist in forest conservation and timber man\u00ad agement, and became president of the State College of Washington, later Washington State University. Arthur H. Compton (1892-1962), who received his Ph.D. in 1916, was a distinguished service professor at the University of Chicago, a Nobel Prize winner in physics (1927), took a leading part in the development of the atomic bomb, and was for a time chancellor of Wash\u00ad ington University in St. Louis. The trustees named one of the two quad\u00ad rangles which were added to the origi\u00ad nal Graduate College in 1963 the Compton Quadrangle in their honor. Wilson M. Compton, then the lone survivor of the three, spoke on their behalf at the dedication of the Compton Quadrangle on May 9, 1964. \"I classify all the teachers I have had in three categories,\" he said, \"those I have for\u00ad gotten, those I have forgiven, and those I will never forget. In the last category I would include Frank Albert Fetter and Edward S. Corwin. My brother Karl, if he were here, would name, I am sure, William F. Magie and O. W. Richardson; my brother, Arthur, Wil\u00ad liam F. Magie and Luther P. Eisenhart.\" Computer Center, The, was estab\u00ad lished in 1962 under Electrical Engi\u00ad neering Professor Edward J. McClus- key, Jr. Located in the Engineering Quadrangle, the first computer was an IBM 7090. Serving primarily the sci\u00ad entific and engineering communities, the computer was enlarged, replaced, and enlarged again to accommodate the rapidly growing demand for service. McCluskey was succeeded as director by Roald Buhler in 1966. Under Buhler's direction, the University, with generous support from the National Science Foundation, built the current Computer Center building at 87 Pros\u00ad pect Avenue, behind Stevenson Hall. Installed in the new building in 1969 was an IBM 360/91, one of the largest and fastest scientific computers avail\u00ad able at the time. Buhler stepped down in 1970 yielding the reins to the current director, Dr. James F. Poage '55. Although designed for research use, the IBM 360/91 also proved adequate to the task of providing service to stu-EDWIN GRANT CONKLIN 113 dents and administrators. Convenient remote job entry stations located in var\u00ad ious buildings around the campus allow the users to submit work and receive results without traveling to the Com\u00ad puter Center. Princeton joined the modern world of time-sharing in 1975 when it acquired an IBM 370/158. Now users can employ the computer to ob\u00ad tain answers to extremely complex problems almost instantaneously. Graphics terminals are available that plot results immediately on video screens. At the push of a button a printed copy of the plot can be ob\u00ad tained. No longer is it necessary to tediously plot results in a laboratory notebook. For the individual user, the com\u00ad puters are fun and exciting; for the University, they are indispensable tools in today's research, instruction, and administration. James F. Poage Conklin, Edwin Grant (1863-1952), eminent biologist and teacher, came to Princeton from the University of Penn\u00ad sylvania in 1908, at the invitation of President Woodrow Wilson, to become the first full-time head of the Depart\u00ad ment of Biology. Chairman for twenty-five years, he organized and guided the early development of the department; as lecturer in the introduc\u00ad tory biology course, he inspired thousands of undergraduates; as in\u00ad vestigator, he carried out fundmental research both in Guyot Hall and, in the summer, at the Marine Biological Lab\u00ad oratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, on the embryonic development of eggs of marine animals. His strong interest in the philosophical implications of biology and particularly of evolution put him in great demand as a public speaker. At the end of his long life he estimated that he had given at least a thousand lectures before a wide variety of audiences, crusading for the accept\u00ad ance of the concept of evolution. He was born in Waldo, Ohio, the son of a busy \"horse and buggy doctor.\" Following his early education in rural schools he entered Ohio Wesleyan University. In great need of money, especially for the purchase of books, he dropped out for half of his third year to teach at a one-room school. In college he was active in debates and oratorical contests. His professor of natural his\u00ad tory aroused his interest in collecting and identifying fossils and the shells of mussels and snails; he later asked Conklin to serve as assistant in the museum. Conklin considered entering the ministry and was ordained as a lay preacher; but, needing money to pay off his debts after graduation, he took a position at Rust University in Missis\u00ad sippi, a missionary college for Negroes, where for three years he taught Latin, Greek, English, history, and all the sci\u00ad ences. He later said he was \"glad to have this opportunity for which I longed, to take part in a most necessary and humane work.\" However, his in\u00ad terest in biology became strong enough for him to choose it for his life work, and he left to enter graduate school at Johns Hopkins. During the summer of 1890 Conklin was at Woods Hole searching for suita\u00ad ble material for a doctoral thesis in em\u00ad bryology. He chose the easily available eggs of a marine snail and discovered that following fertilization these eggs divide according to a fixed and striking pattern, which enabled him to follow individual cells and their descendants to their final location in the various or-114 CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF 1787 gans of the larva. Through this \"cell line\u00ad age\" the origin of the larval structures could be traced back to different re\u00ad gions of the egg. In later years he suc\u00ad cessfully extended these studies to eggs of other marine animals and demon\u00ad strated that an undivided egg, far from being a homogeneous mass of proto\u00ad plasm, possesses a remarkable degree of organization in its cytoplasm. He further refined his investigations through various experimental tech\u00ad niques, such as the isolation of cells, application of centrifugal force and use of salt solutions. At a time when biolo\u00ad gists tended to be overawed by the im\u00ad portance of the genes located in the nu\u00ad cleus, he elucidated the role of the cytoplasm of the egg in the early differ\u00ad entiation of the embryo, an essential but much neglected aspect of develop\u00ad ment. Conklin's scholarly achievements were recognized by his election to the American Philosophical Society when he was only thirty-four; he was later its executive officer (1936-1942) and presi\u00ad dent (1942-1945 and 1948-1952), the only member ever elected twice to this high office\u2014the second time at the age of eighty-five. He was also a member of the National Academy of Sciences, president of several scientific societies, and a member of several foreign learned societies and academies. A deeply religious man, Conklin was much concerned with the relations be\u00ad tween science, ethics, and religion, a subject on which he wrote several books, published numerous magazine articles, and gave many speeches. Conklin believed that scientific evi\u00ad dence of man's animal ancestry need not undermine religious faith or belief in human dignity. \"The real dignity of man,\" he once wrote, \"consists not in his origin but in what he is and in what he may become.\" Perhaps the most conclusive statement of his point of view is found among the last words of his brief, posthumously published \"spiritual autobiography\": \"No one can furnish scientific proof of the existence or nature of a divine plan in the fulfill\u00ad ment of which men may cooperate, but it is evident that such an ideal lends strength and courage to mortal men.\" However great Conklin's scientific achievements were, his most enduring legacy may have been the personal in\u00ad fluence he exerted on those who were fortunate enough to come into close contact with him. His contagious en\u00ad thusiasm, his deep concern for others, his readiness to encourage and support young people have been decisive fac\u00ad tors in many lives. Gerhard Fankhauser Constitutional Convention of 1787, The, was attended by more alumni of Princeton than any other American or British institution. Representing their states were nine men who had studied under Presidents Burr, Finley, and Witherspoon: Alexander Martin 1756 (North Carolina) William Paterson 1763 (New Jersey) Oliver Ellsworth 1766 (Connecticut) Luther Martin 1766 (Maryland) William C. Houston 1768 (New Jersey) Gunning Bedford, Jr. 1771 (Delaware) James Madison 1771 (Virginia) William R. Davie 1776 (North Carolina) Jonathan Dayton 1776 (New Jersey) CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF 1787 115 Five of the college alumni at the con\u00ad vention had attended William and Mary, five Yale,* three Harvard, three Columbia, two the University of Penn\u00ad sylvania, one Oxford, one Glasgow, and one had studied at three universities in Scotland. (Twenty-five of the fifty-five members of the convention, including George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, had not attended college.) The large number of graduates of Nas\u00ad sau Hall at the convention reflected the wide geographic distribution of its graduates generally. Princeton's alumni were delegates from six states, while Yale (which stood next in this respect) were from four, and all of Harvard's were from Massachusetts. Three of the Princetonians represented New Jersey, two North Carolina, and one each Con\u00ad necticut, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. Outstanding in the New Jersey dele\u00ad gation was William Paterson (q.v.), de\u00ad scribed by William Pierce (a Georgia delegate whose notes include interest\u00ad ing character sketches of convention members) as a man of great modesty who always picked the right time and the right way to enter a debate and never spoke \"but when he [understood] his subject well, \"t William Churchill Houston, pre\u00ad viously professor of mathematics and natural philosophy at Princeton, was, at the time of the convention, clerk of the Supreme Court of New Jersey. Jonathan Dayton, son of a store\u00ad keeper in Elizabeth town, had served with distinction in the Revolution, and, at twenty-six, was the convention's youngest delegate. Pierce, an army comrade, said that Dayton had \"an im\u00ad petuosity in his temper\" that was in\u00ad jurious to him, but that he also had an \"honest rectitude.\" Alexander Martin, who headed the North Carolina delegation, had been a colonel in the Revolution, but after hav\u00ad ing been cleared of court-martial charges of cowardice in the battle of Germantown, had resigned his com\u00ad mission. He was later governor of his state\u2014\"a Man of sense,\" Pierce said, but \"no Speaker.\" The other Princetonian from North Carolina, William Richardson Davie, a tall and elegant figure, was only thirty. A daring officer in the Revolution he had since become an accomplished lawyer. Oliver Ellsworth (q.v.), tall, dig\u00ad nified, and commanding, was an able member of the Connecticut delegation. A supreme court judge in that state, he showed himself \"a Gentleman of a clear, deep, and copious understand\u00ad ing; eloquent. . . in public debate; and always attentive to his duty.\" Gunning Bedford, Jr., who had been class valedictorian in 1771, was attor\u00ad ney general of Delaware. Slender and handsome as a student, he was by 1787, according to Pierce, \"very corpulent.\" He was an impressive speaker, but a nervous one, apt to be hasty and im\u00ad petuous. Luther Martin, attorney general of Maryland, was an acknowledged leader of the bar with a prodigious memory that enabled him to win his cases more by weight of precedent and knowledge of law than by his powers of expression. Pierce found him \"so extremely prolix, that he never speaks without tiring the patience of all who hear him.\" James Madison (q.v.) was an influen\u00ad tial member of distinguished Vir\u00ad ginia delegation. \"Every Person,\" Pierce wrote, \"seems to acknowledge his greatness. He blends together the profound politician with the Scholar 116 CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF 1787 . . . and tho' he cannot be called an Orator, he is a most agreeable, elo\u00ad quent, and convincing Speaker. . . . [He is] a Gentleman of great modesty, with a remarkable sweet temper.\" PRINCETON'S ROLE IN THE CONVENTION Three major proposals were consid\u00ad ered by the convention. The Virginia Plan was generally favored by the large states and those laying claim to western land. It sought a strong national gov\u00ad ernment with two legislative houses elected on the basis of population. The New Jersey Plan, favored principally by the small states, called for equal repre\u00ad sentation of the states in a single legisla\u00ad tive body. The Connecticut Com\u00ad promise, which broke the deadlock, proposed a lower house, elected in proportion to population, and an upper house, in which each state, regardless of size, would have equal representa\u00ad tion. A Princetonian was influential in the formation of each of these proposals. The Virginia Plan was outlined in reso\u00ad lutions presented by Governor Ed\u00ad mund Randolph, Yale 1892) much of Madison's handiwork in forming these resolutions.\"\\ The New Jersey Plan was presented and vigorously defended by William Paterson. Although each of the three delegates from Connecticut has been credited by one writer or another with bringing about the com\u00ad promise, it was Oliver Ellsworth who made the motion that \"in the second branch . . . each State shall have an equal vote,\" and during the debate he seems to have borne the brunt of the at\u00ad tack on the compromise by the large- state men. Paterson was supported in his advo\u00adcacy of the New Jersey Plan by Jonathan Dayton, the junior member of his delegation, Gunning Bedford of Delaware, and Luther Martin of Mary\u00ad land, all of whom spoke ardently\u2014and sometimes immoderately\u2014on behalf of the small states. At one point Dayton called the Virginia Plan \"an amphibious monster.\" At another, Bedford said that if the large states persisted in the Vir\u00ad ginia Plan, the small ones would \"find some foreign ally of more honor and good faith,\" who would \"take them by the hand and do them justice.\" Luther Martin, during a spell of extremely hot weather, delivered a two-day harangue in defense of state sovereignty \"with much diffuseness & considerable ve\u00ad hemence,\" Madison observed in his re\u00ad cord of the debates. Martin refused to sign the Constitution and later cam\u00ad paigned unsuccessfully in Maryland against its ratification. At the conclusion of the convention, Madison sent a copy of the Constitution to Thomas Jefferson in Paris. It was im\u00ad possible, he wrote Jefferson, \"to con\u00ad sider the degree of concord which ulti\u00ad mately prevailed as less than a mira\u00ad cle.\" Madison's own contributions to this successful outcome were consider\u00ad able. An important participant in the debates, respected by both allies and opponents as the leader of those favor\u00ad ing a strong national government, he was, in Professor Farrand's words, the \"leading spirit\" of the convention and the \"master builder\" of the Constitu\u00ad tion. All of the Princeton delegates except William Churchill Houston (who died of tuberculosis a year after the conven\u00ad tion) went on to eventful careers, either in the federal government they had helped to create or in their own states. Most conspicuous, of course, was James Madison, who served the federal gov-CONTINENTAL CONGRESS 117 ernment twenty-four years as a mem\u00ad ber of the House of Representatives, secretary of state, and president. Al\u00ad though he had once said that his labors at the convention had \"almost killed\" him, he outlived all the other delegates and spent his last years, in his eighties, at Montpelier, receiving visitors and answering letters, still explaining and expounding the Constitution. * Including Oliver Ellsworth who studied there, 1762-64, before coming to Princeton. f \"Notes of Major William Pierce on the Fed\u00ad eral Convention of 1787,\" in American Historical Review, January 1898. } The Framing of the Constitution of the United States (Yale University Press, 1913). Continental Congress, The (1774-1789) numbered among its members Prince\u00ad ton alumni representing all of the col\u00ad ony-states except Massachusetts. The Congress also benefited from the serv\u00ad ices of two officers of the College: Pres\u00ad ident John Witherspoon, a member for six years, and Trustee Elias Roudinot, president of the Congress in 1782-1783. In the summer and early fall of the lat\u00ad ter year, the Congress met in Princeton. Following is a list of delegates who attended Princeton, compiled from biographical sketches of members of the Continental Congress in the 1972 edition of the Biographical Directory of the American Congress, and further supplemented by material in Prince- tonians (1776, 1777) Joseph James Henry Lee, Jr. 1773 (1785-1788) * Although attendance at Princeton was indi\u00ad cated in the Biographical Directory of the Ameri\u00ad can Congress, precise confirmation of the fact was not possible when this list was compiled. Controller, the office of, was estab\u00ad lished in 1920 with George C. Win- tringer as first incumbent. A graduate of the Class of 1894, he returned to Princeton in 1912 to occupy the new office of secretary of business adminis\u00ad tration, and eight years later took on added duties and assumed the title of controller. The controller and his staff keep the books and collect all monies due the University; they disburse salaries and wages to the faculty and staff and amounts due others for goods and services. When the office was es\u00ad tablished in 1920, the funds so handled totaled about $1.25 million annually. Fifty years later they were in excess of $70 million. Controllers have been: George C. Wintringer 1920-1941 Gail A. Mills 1941-1961 Wilbur M. Young 1961-1975 Raymond J. Clark 1975- Corwin, Edward S. (1878-1963), third McCormick Professor of Jurisprudence and first chairman of the Department of Politics, was considered the leading ex\u00ad positor of the intent and meaning of the Constitution. Born on a farm near Plymouth, Michigan, he first devel\u00ad oped his interest in constitutional law at the University of Michigan, where he was Phi Beta Kappa and president of the Class of 1900, and at the University of Pennsylvania, where he completed his doctoral work in American history under the guidance of John Bach McMaster (q.v.) in 1905. It was McMaster who turned Corwin toward Princeton. During a discussion of his \"approaching jobless condition\" at Sunday evening supper with the McMasters in June of 1905 (Corwin later recalled), his mentor suggested that he \"run over to Princeton and apply to Woodrow Wilson for one of those preceptorships they're handing out over there.\" This he did the next day, armed with an \"extraordinarily flowery\" letter of introduction from McMaster. Everything proceeded \"eas\u00ad ily and delightfully\" during his inter\u00ad views with President Wilson and with Professor Winthrop More Daniels, chairman of the Department of His\u00ad tory, Politics, and Economics, and sev\u00ad eral days later he received word that he had been appointed a Princeton pre\u00ad ceptor at the salary he had suggested would be necessary \"if I was ever to in\u00ad duce my creditors to lose interest in me.\" That fall Corwin joined Wilson's original group of preceptors and began an association with Princeton that was to last almost sixty years. Though he considered Wilson \"the most impressive human being\" he had ever met, he didn't always agree with him, once vigorously challenging some of the president's more conservative views at a departmental meeting, much to the consternation of appar\u00ad ently everyone but Wilson, whose high regard for his outspoken young col\u00ad league prompted him to select Corwin to update his book Division and Re\u00ad union in 1908. Ten years later, in 1918, Corwin was appointed to the chair first occupied by Wilson, the McCormick Professorship of Jurisprudence, which EDWARD S. CORWIN 119 he held until his retirement in 1946. When a separate Department of Poli\u00ad tics was formed in 1924, Corwin be\u00ad came its first chairman, serving in that post until 1935. Corwin's performance as a teacher led seniors repeatedly to vote his un\u00ad dergraduate course, Constitutional In\u00ad terpretation, \"most difficult\" and \"most valuable.\" Because of his erect posture and military bearing, he was affection\u00ad ately known to generations of graduate students as \"The General.\" According to his former student, Alpheus T. Ma\u00ad son, who succeeded him as McCormick Professor, he had the special gift \"of reaching within each person, of dis\u00ad covering something firm and worth\u00ad while, of encouraging him to stand on it,\" and the ability, \"rare among teachers, . . . to judge young men, not by what they are, but by what they may yet become.\" Corwin's influence eventually ex\u00ad tended beyond the campus to the fed\u00ad eral government, which he served in 1935 as an adviser to the Public Works Administration, and in 1936 and 1937 as a special assistant and consultant to the attorney general on constitutional issues. The independence of mind that had impressed Wilson also charac\u00ad terized Corwin's response to Roosevelt, whom he publicly supported on the plan to enlarge the Supreme Court and publicly opposed three years later when Roosevelt broke tradition and ran for a third term. Of the more than twenty books Cor\u00ad win wrote, the best known and most influential are his studies of the Con\u00ad stitution and the presidency. His most successful book was written at the sug\u00ad gestion of his companions in the Snuff Club\u2014a small cross-departmental group that included Corwin, E. G. Conklin, Luther P. Eisenhart, Chris\u00adtian Gauss, Duane Reed Stuart, among others\u2014who, after hearing several pa\u00ad pers he read to the club, urged him to write an exposition of the Constitution for the general reader. The Constitu\u00ad tion and What It Means Today, first published by Princeton University Press in 1920, continues in print after thirteen revised editions and numerous translations. His later book, The Presi\u00ad dent, Office and Powers (1940), was still considered the \"Bible\" in its field when a newly revised fourth edition appeared in 1958. A distinctive characteristic of Cor\u00ad win's literary style, as observed by Al\u00ad pheus Mason, was his \"penchant for ar\u00ad resting comment and devastating wit\" which \"reflected the man and his mind\u2014sharp, penetrating, and some\u00ad times astringent.\" The flavor of his style is evident in his comments on judicial review (\"American democracy's way of covering its bet\") and the cabinet (\"an administrative anachronism\" that should be replaced by a legislative council \"whose daily salt does not come from the Presidential table.\") The same quality marked his conversation. When a colleague asked about a newly ap\u00ad pointed Supreme Court Justice, \"He's not a very big man, is he?\" Corwin re\u00ad plied, \"No, but then, it wasn't a very big vacancy.\" Not above enjoying an occasional pun, he was heard to observe\u2014upon Frank Murphy's ap\u00ad pointment to the Court have justice tempered with Mur\u00ad phy.\" Corwin's retirement ended neither his service to the government nor his willingness to take issue with it. As editor of the Library of Congress's legislative reference division, he di\u00ad rected a research project that resulted in a massive volume, The Constitution Annotated: Analysis and Interpreta-120 CORWIN HALL tion. In 1954 he became chairman of a national committee opposed to the Bricker amendment to restrict the pres\u00ad ident's treaty-making powers, and dur\u00ad ing President Eisenhower's illness the following year, he scored the adminis\u00ad tration for granting too much power to the president's assistant, Sherman Adams. A president of the American Political Science Association, winner of the American Philosophical Society's Frank\u00ad lin Medal and Phillips Prize, and the recipient of honorary degrees from Michigan and Princeton, he was among the scholars singled out for citation at the Harvard Tercentenary. Other hon\u00ad ors came in 1952 when the original Woodrow Wilson Hall was redesig\u00ad nated Edward S. Corwin Hall, and on Constitution Day 1961 when Corwin was cited for his \"brilliant service to both institutions\u2014the Constitution and Princeton University.\" On that occa\u00ad sion one of his former students, Adlai E. Stevenson, recalled how much his undergraduate days at Princeton had been enriched by Corwin's \"warmth, his wisdom, and his wit.\" Although Corwin never wrote the \"single, monumental\" book he planned, the corpus of his work accord\u00ad ing to Professor Mason, \"advances the frontiers of every significant aspect of his subject\": Generally recognized as the most learned and discriminating of all our modern constitutional authorities, Corwin was a scholar's scholar. His\u00ad torians, political scientists, and legal practitioners join in proclaiming his preeminence. The law itself reflects his own pointed dictum: \"If judges make law, so do commentators.\" Corwin is in the great tradition of Cooley and Kent. His contributions are sources of learning and understanding\u2014hallmarks to emu\u00ad late and revere. Corwin Hall at one time stood on Washington Road near Prospect Av\u00ad enue, where it was erected in 1951 to house the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. The architect, Stephen F. Voorhees '00, used red brick with limestone trim to blend with Seventy-Nine Hall across the street. To preserve a handsome old copper beech tree he started the build\u00ad ing farther from the corner than he otherwise would have done and to keep out traffic noises he restricted windows to the north and east sides. On the west, the long unbroken expanse of brick wall to the right of the main en\u00ad trance which confronted one approach\u00ad ing from McCosh Walk troubled many people. Soon after its completion there appeared on it in foot-high white let\u00ad ters, so well executed it was suspected they were done by a student of ar\u00ad chitecture, these words from Shelley's Ozymandias: \"Look on my work, ye mighty, and despair!\" The building was moved almost a hundred yards northeast to its present site on May 20, 1963. This engineering feat was accomplished by the New York firm of Spencer, White, and Prentiss, using hydraulic jacks to push the build\u00ad ing along twelve steel tracks. The actual moving took only twelve hours but two months were needed to prepare for it and another three months to secure the building to its new foundation. When the new Woodrow Wilson building was completed in 1965, the old one was assigned to one of the School's chief allies, the Department of Politics, and to the Center of Interna\u00ad tional Studies, and its name changed from Wilson Hall to Corwin Hall in DAVID COWELL 121 honor of Edward S. Corwin, Wilson's successor as McCormick Professor of Jurisprudence and the first chairman of the Department of Politics. Council of the Princeton University Community (CPUC, U-Council) is primarily a deliberative and consulta\u00ad tive body, with authority to \"consider and investigate any question of Univer\u00ad sity policy, any aspect of the governing of the University, and any general issue related to the welfare of the University; and to make recommendations regard\u00ad ing any such matters to the appropriate decision-making bodies . . . or to the appropriate officers of the University.\" The Council also has authority to \"make rules regarding the conduct of resident members of the University community,\" to oversee rule-making by other bodies within the University community, and to oversee all applica\u00ad tions of rules. The Council normally would not con\u00ad sider matters primarily academic in na\u00ad ture. A Special Committee on the Struc\u00ad ture of the University chaired by Pro\u00ad fessor Stanley Kelley, Jr., proposed the creation of the Council in May 1969. Sometimes referred to as \"Kelley's Re\u00ad public,\" the Council was designed as \"a permanent conference of the repre\u00ad sentatives of all major groups of the University\" where \"they could each raise problems that concern them and . . . be exposed to each other's views.\" The Council first met on October 27, 1969. Typically it meets once a month, October through May, with special meetings as needed. Following a series of Charter amendments in the fall of 1975, mem\u00ad bership of the Council was set at 50, in\u00ad cluding 6 senior officers of the adminis\u00ad tration, 15 faculty members, 12 under\u00adgraduates, 7 graduate students, 6 staff members, and 4 alumni. The president of the University is the presiding officer of the Council and chairman of its Executive Committee. Much of the work of the Council is conducted through its standing com\u00ad mittees, including the Executive Committee, Committees on Rights and Rules, Governance, Priorities, and Re\u00ad sources, and the Judicial Committee. Special committees also have been es\u00ad tablished from time to time. Robert K. Durkee Cowell, David (1704-1760), a Presbyte\u00ad rian minister of Trenton, NJ., was a hard-working trustee of the college in its early years and served briefly as act\u00ad ing president in 1757-1758. \"Few in\u00ad vested with the same trust,\" said Presi\u00ad dent Davies \"discharged it with so much zeal, diligence and alacrity.\" Cowell graduated from Harvard in 1732 and three years later was voted his M.A. in absentia, \"he being far distant preaching the Gospel at New Jersey.\" Unable to support himself by the contributions of his parishioners, \"he gave some part of his time,\" Davies said \"to the study and practice of physic [medicine], in which he made no in\u00ad considerable figure.\" Cowell was named a trustee of the College in the charter of 1748, and it was he who was commissioned by the Board of Trustees to carry its thanks to Governor Belcher for \"granting so ample and well-contrived a charter.\" He promoted a lottery for the College and, since New Jersey refused to sanc\u00ad tion it, persuaded a Harvard classmate who lived in Stamford to manage the drawing in Connecticut, where lot\u00ad teries were permitted. He conducted the negotiations that led to Samuel Davies's acceptance of the Board's invi-122 CREATIVE ARTS PROGRAM tation to become fourth president of the College. Sibley's Harvard Graduates quotes from one of Cowell's letters to Davies, observing that Cowell \"was describing the college at Princeton in terms unlike those since employed by other Harvard men\": The College ought to be esteemed of as much importance to the interests of religion and liberty as any other institution of the kind in America. God, at first, in a most remarkable manner owned and blessed it. It was the Lord's doing. He erected it; for our beginning was nothing. He car\u00ad ried it on till it was marvellous in our eyes. Creative Arts Program, The, precur\u00ad sor of three later programs in Creative Writing, Theatre and Dance, and Vis\u00ad ual Arts, was first organized in 1939 by a faculty committee under the leader\u00ad ship of Dean Christian Gauss. The original program was supported by a five-year grant from the Carnegie Corporation that made possible the en\u00ad richment of opportunities for under\u00ad graduates with particular aptitude and interest in music, painting, sculpture, and writing. For student composers of music, regular courses in harmony and composition were supplemented by weekly meetings with Professor Roger Sessions. Students interested in draw\u00ad ing and painting worked with James E. Davis '23 and Alden Wicks '37. Classes in sculpture were conducted by Joseph Brown, the boxing coach, in the cellar of Dean Gauss's residence, the Joseph Henry House. Students with talent in writing worked with Allen Tate, poet and critic, who came to Princeton as first resident Fellow in Creative Writ\u00ad ing. Under Dean Gauss's watchful eye, the program survived the Second World War in modified form and began to blossom again soon afterward. Other committee chairmen who guided the development of the program during the next two decades were English Profes\u00ad sors Donald A. Stauffer, Carlos Baker, R. P. Blackmur, and Edmund Keeley; Architecture Professor Francis A. Comstock; Music Professor Edward T. Cone; French Professor E.B.O. Borg- erhoff; and Philosophy Professor Arthur Szathmary. Allen Tate's successors as Visiting Lecturers in Creative Writing have been well-known poets, critics, and novelists, among them R. P. Blackmur, John Berryman, Joseph N. Frank, Delmore Schwartz, Richard Eberhart, Leslie A. Fiedler, Sean O'Faolin, Philip Roth, Elizabeth Bowen, and Theodore R. Weiss. A number of Visit\u00ad ing Lecturers became permanent mem\u00ad bers of the faculty. Tate's immediate successor, Richard P. Blackmur, stayed on as professor of English. Joseph N. Frank, who served in the fifties, later returned as Professor of Comparative 'Literature, and in the sixties Theodore R. Weiss was given continuing ap\u00ad pointment as Professor of English and Creative Arts. Several Visiting Lec\u00ad turers were alumni of the program: William Louis O. Coxe and Gal- way Kinnell 48. Another Princeton graduate who taught creative writing in later years was John McPhee '53, who led a workshop in the literature of fact. Successors to James E. Davis and Alden M. Wicks as Resident Critic in Painting included Hereward L. Cooke, Jr., William C. Seitz, Stephen Greene, Hyde Solomon, Joseph J. Stefanelli, Esteban Vicente, George Ortman, and Thomas B. Cornell. SAMUEL DAVIES 123 In 1966 the program was given a home in the Nassau Street School, now called 185 Nassau, which had just been acquired by the University. Joseph Brown fell heir to the school's old gym\u00ad nasium for his sculpture classes, and there was space enough for additional sculpture studios and five painting studios. In its new home the program grew rapidly. Enrollment in courses in creative writing, musical composition, and painting doubled. A playwriting workshop, conducted by William McCleery, playwright and editor of the quarterly University, was added to the offerings in creative writing, and ex\u00ad tracurricular woodcarving under Eco\u00ad nomics Professor William Baumol sup\u00ad plemented the regular courses in sculpture. In the early seventies, the rapid growth of student interest in the crea\u00ad tive arts led to further expansion of the original program, and by 1975 there were three separate programs\u2014Crea\u00ad tive Writing, Theatre and Dance, and Visual Arts. CREATIVE WRITING Throughout this period of change, the mainstays in Creative Writing have been Edmund Keeley '48, who became director of this program in 1971 after guiding the original Creative Arts Pro\u00ad gram through its previous five years, and Theodore Weiss, who had been as\u00ad sociated with the original program since 1967. Keeley, a novelist and translator, has received the Rome Prize of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and has been nominated for the National Book Award in translation. Weiss, a poet and critic, received the Brandeis Award in Poetry and is editor, with his wife, of the Quarterly Review of Literature. THEATRE AND DANCE A number of the workshops in acting, directing, and playwriting are taught by members of the professional repertory company of McCarter Theatre, while courses in modern dance have the ben\u00ad efit of the experience and skill of a pro\u00ad fessional dancer and choreographer, Ze'eva Cohen. The director of the pro\u00ad gram since it assumed separate status in 1975 has been Daniel Seltzer '54, who came to Princeton in 1970 from his po\u00ad sition as director of Harvard's Loeb Drama Center. An example of the pro\u00ad gram's balance of the academic with the professional was provided by the di\u00ad rector himself in 1976 when he re\u00ad ceived a Theatre World award and a Tony nomination for his performance in a Broadway play\u2014an accomplishment he managed while on leave from his regular duties as a professor in the De\u00ad partment of English. VISUAL ARTS The Visual Arts Program has devel\u00ad oped a broad range of offerings in many fields\u2014drawing, painting, sculpture, film history and criticism, photography, printmaking, typography, graphic de\u00ad sign, and ceramics. One of the pro\u00ad gram's best known Visiting Lecturers was film director Marcel Ophuls, whose widely acclaimed documentary The Memory of Justice was made, in part, during his stay at the University. Sculpture was still the province of Joe Brown (until his retirement in 1977), along with James Seawright, a maker of modern kinetic sculptures and director of the program since 1975. Previous di\u00ad rectors were architect Michael Graves, 1971-1973, and art historian Rosalind Krauss, 1974-1975. The primary aims of the three pro\u00ad grams have remained essentially the 124 CRICKET same as those stated by the faculty committee for the original Creative Arts Program\u2014\"to allow the talented undergraduate to work in the creative arts under professional supervision while pursuing a regular liberal arts course of study, as well as to offer all in\u00ad terested undergraduates an opportu\u00ad nity to develop their creative faculties in connection with the general program of humanistic education.\" Cricket made its first appearance at Princeton in 1857 and, despite the Nas\u00ad sau hit's prediction that \"the college authorities would stop it, as there was something wicket in it,\" it has been played here sporadically ever since. The Nassau Cricket Club played sev\u00ad eral outside matches in the 1860s and 70s. In this century, cricket has been played at the Graduate College chiefly by graduate students from the British Commonwealth in intramural matches, although teams played occasional games with other colleges in the 1950s and early 1960s. In the mid-seventies, both undergraduate and graduate members of a revived cricket club competed in the newly-formed East\u00ad ern Seaboard Cricket Conference. Cross-country running, a popular in\u00ad tramural diversion at Princeton as early as 1880 when the Hare and Hounds Club was founded, began auspiciously as a varsity sport in 1899 with John Cregan 1899 winning the first intercol\u00ad legiate championship meet ever held. Fitting sequels to Cregan's notable achievement came in 1914, when Don\u00ad ald Morrison '15 finished second in the IC4A Championships, and again after the First World War, when Princeton teams placed second in the Intercol- legiates in 1919, 1920, and 1921, and won the triangular meet with Har\u00ad vard and Yale in 1922. In the thirties, Bill Bonthron '34 ex\u00ad celled, going undefeated his freshman, sophomore, and junior years. He and his classmate Charles M. Reed finished arm-in-arm in a first place tie in every dual meet their sophomore year. The 1937 team was undefeated and won the Big Three meet, in which its captain Frederic Rosengarten '38 placed first. After the interruption of World War II, Princeton cross-country reached a high point when the 1949 team went undefeated in dual meet competition, took the Big Three championship, and placed second in the Heptagonal cross-country championship meet. * That year's captain, Stan Johnson '50, won the triangular meet with Harvard and Yale for the third time in his varsity career. In the 1950s six Princeton har\u00ad riers came in first in Big Three meets: Dick '51 (1950), Al Vodrey Rod Zwirner '59 (1956), and Mike Kingston '62 (1959). Maxwell (who placed first in every dual meet his senior year) and Vodrey were second in the Heptagonals. Most suc\u00ad cessful of all was Zwirner, who as a sophomore won every dual meet and was also individual champion in the Heptagonals. The University's thinclads, as the Prince has sometimes called them, were strong contenders in dual compe\u00ad tition and in the various championship meets throughout the 1960s and the early 1970s. Seven years after Prince\u00ad ton's second-place finish in the 1968 Heptagonals, the 1975 team captured Princeton's first championship, an example followed by the 1976 and 1977 teams, who produced Princeton's sec\u00ad ond and third Heptagonal champion\u00ad ships. The 1975 championship team, CUYLER HALL 125 one of the best in Princeton's history, also placed first in the Big Three meet, second in the Intercollegiates, and fif\u00ad teenth in the National Championships. Captain Larry Tractenberg '76 tied for first place with his teammate Craig Masback '77 in the Big Three meet, and finished third in both the Heptagonals and the Intercollegiates. In the early years, cross-country was under the supervision of special coaches, but since the 1930s it has been the responsibility of track coaches Mat- tie Geis, 1932-1956; Peter Morgan, 1956-1970; and Larry Ellis, since 1970. A woman's cross-country team organ\u00ad ized in 1976 placed fourth in the first Ivy League women's championship meet in November of the same year. * The seven teams constituting the heptagon in 1939 when the meet was first organized eventu\u00ad ally grew to ten (the eight Ivy League teams plus Army and Navy). Cuyler Hall was built in memory of Cornelius C. Cuyler, a New York banker who was a trustee of the Uni\u00ad versity from 1898 until his death in 1909. His had always been \"a magical name for any 1879 man,\" his classmate, Woodrow Wilson, then governor of New Jersey, said at the dedication of the building in 1912, and it was \"singu\u00ad larly appropriate\" that a dormitory \"symbolic of the democratic life and the comradeships of the University\" should bear his name. \"He always meant to me a singular stimulation,\" Governor Wilson concluded, \"he imparted his own energy to everything he did. Let us hope that his spirit will in some de\u00ad gree touch the life of this dormitory.\" Dallas, George Mifflin (1792-1864), eleventh vice president of the United States (1845-1849), was a graduate of Princeton in the Class of 1810. His father was a prosperous lawyer and man of affairs in Philadelphia who served as Madison's Secretary of the Treasury 1814-1816. The younger Dallas entered public life three years after he left Princeton as secretary to the chairman of the commission that negotiated the treaty ending the War of 1812. He was mayor of Philadelphia, United States senator, and Minister to Russia prior to his election as vice president; later he was Minister to Great Britain. His biographer called him \"conservative and cosmopolitan, precise and dignified . . . the gentleman in politics.\" Princeton conferred an honorary LL. D. on him in 1857, about the same time the citizens of a thriving commu\u00ad nity in northeast Texas named their newly incorporated town for him. Davies, Samuel (1723-1761), fourth president of Princeton, was born in New Castle County, Delaware. His parents could not aiford to send him to college but were determined that he should be trained for the ministry. He studied in Samuel Blair's famous school at Fagg's Manor, Chester County, Pennsylvania, was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of New Castle when he was twenty-two, and was ordained as an evangelist to Virginia a year later. In Anglican Virginia, where dissent\u00ad ers were subjected to constant vexa\u00ad tions, he built up a strong Presbyterian membership and became the advocate and defender of their civil rights and re\u00ad ligious liberties. He conducted services in seven houses of worship dispersed through five counties, riding horseback through fields and forests to minister to his scattered congregations. A sufferer from tuberculosis, \"he preached in the day and had his hectic fever by night,\" but was nevertheless \"resolved that while life and sufficient strength re-126 SAMUEL DAVIES mained, he would devote himself ear\u00ad nestly to the work of preaching the gos\u00ad pel.\" As a principal founder and first moderator of the Presbytery of Hanover, which comprised all the Presbyterian ministers in Virginia and North Carolina, he was considered \"the animating soul of the whole dissenting interests in these two colonies.\" In 1753 Davies and Gilbert Tennant, another well-known Presbyterian minis\u00ad ter, were chosen by Princeton trustees to go to Great Britain and Ireland in search of donations for the College. Davies kept a diary of the mission, which was later published. Their five- week ocean voyage from Philadel\u00ad phia to London was rough. The ship smelled; they were both seasick, and Davies suffered from the toothache, but they prayed alternately in their cabin for the success of their mission. Their prayers were answered. During their eleven-month stay in the British Isles, they secured donations\u2014some indi\u00ad vidual gifts including three guineas from Oliver Cromwell's great-grandson, but chiefly church collections\u2014sufficient to build Nassau Hall and the president's house and to found a charitable fund \"for the education of pious and indigent youth for the gospel ministry.\" Davies, then only thirty, preached some sixty sermons. Near the end of his stay he had an apoplectic fit but recovered suf\u00ad ficiently to undertake the voyage home. The return trip lasted thirteen weeks and was tempestuous. Storms threat\u00ad ened to engulf the vessel, and Davies was saddened by the curses of the sailors and perplexed as to what to do about them, they were \"so habituated to blasphemy.\" In 1758 Davies was elected to suc\u00ad ceed Jonathan Edwards as president of the College, but declined election, partly because of a reluctance to quit his pastoral work in Virginia, partly be\u00ad cause he knew that while a majority of the trustees had voted for his election, a minority shared his own belief that Samuel Finley, a member of the Board, was better qualified for the office. The trustees subsequently reelected Davies and persuaded him to accept. He took up his duties on July 26, 1759. Eight\u00ad een months later, on February 4, 1761, he died of pneumonia, in his thirty- eighth year, a few weeks after having been bled for \"a bad cold.\" During his brief tenure Davies raised the standards for admission and for the bachelor's degree, instituted monthly orations by members of the senior class (an important part of undergraduate education at Princeton for more than a century), composed odes to peace and to science which were sung at Com\u00ad mencement, and drew up a catalogue of the 1,281 volumes in the college library \"to give Information to such who are watching for Opportunities of doing good; and to afford particular Benefac\u00ad tors the Pleasure of seeing how many others have concurred with them in their favourite Charity.\" Davies left his mark as scholar and patriot on his students, particularly the eleven members of the Class of 1760 whom he taught as seniors. \"Whatever be your Place,\" he told them in his bac\u00ad calaureate address, \"imbibe and cher\u00ad ish a public spirit. Serve your genera\u00ad tion.\" This they did. Among the eleven were a member of the Continental Congress, chaplains in the Continental Army, judges in Maine and Pennsylva\u00ad nia, the founder of a college in North Carolina, a member of the United States House of Representatives, and a signer of the Declaration of Independ\u00ad ence. Davies was long remembered as one of the great pulpit orators of his genera-THE OFFICE OF DEAN 127 tion. Patrick Henry, who as a boy had frequently heard him preach, acknowl\u00ad edged Davies's influence on his own oratory. Davies's sermons went through four editions in the United States and nine editions in England, and for more than fifty years after his death were among the most widely read of any in the English language. At Princeton, Davies was loved and respected; as one trustee wrote an\u00ad other, \"There never was a college happier in a president.\" Davis Center for Historical Studies, The, established in 1968, is named for Shelby CuIIom Davis '30, who in 1964 gave the University more than $5 mil\u00ad lion for support of the Department of History. Davis, who graduated from the department with highest honors and has served as chairman of its advi\u00ad sory council since 1941, made this gift to assure the continuance of excellence in scholarship and the teaching of his\u00ad tory at Princeton University. The income from the Davis Fund is used in a variety of ways. Two chairs have been established: the George Henry Davis '86 Professorship of American History, which honors the donor's father, and the Shelby Cullom Davis '30 Professorship of European History. (Davis won a doctoral degree at the University of Geneva, and he later served as United States Ambas\u00ad sador to Switzerland.) In addition, funds are provided for the purchase of books for the University Library, for exploratory ventures in undergraduate teaching, for graduate student fellow\u00ad ships, for special costs of research by members of the department, and for the Davis Center, the most innovative part of the expanded program. The Center's chief function is to con\u00ad duct the Davis seminar in which mem\u00adbers of the faculty, visitors from other institutions, graduate students, and selected undergraduates participate. For periods of time from one to four years, the members of the seminar di\u00ad rect their attention to a single theme or aspect of history in which they have a common interest. Topics represent rel\u00ad atively new approaches to the study of history, involving the investigation of neglected subjects or the application of new methods to older subjects. Em\u00ad phasis is placed on interdisciplinary ap\u00ad proaches and on topics that do not re\u00ad strict participation to specialists in a single geographical area or period of time. Each year a number of scholars from other institutions are brought to Princeton as Visiting Davis Fellows, with no obligations other than to take part in the seminar and to pursue re\u00ad searches related to its current theme. The end product is intended to be a published work embodying the more significant papers developed through the seminar. Among the themes chosen for study have been \"The History of Higher Education,\" \"The History of Popular Religion,\" and \"The History of Popular Culture.\" The first publication was a two-volume work, The University in Society, published by Princeton Uni\u00ad versity Press in 1974, and edited by Lawrence Stone, who has served as di\u00ad rector of the Davis Center since its es\u00ad tablishment. The Davis Center was the original sponsor of Princetonians, 1748-1768: A Biographical Dictionary, edited by James McLachlan and pub\u00ad lished by Princeton University Press in 1976. W. Frank Craven Dean, the office of, came into being in 1883. Since then deans have prolifer-128 DEAN OF THE CHAPEL ated\u2014all told there have been ten kinds (eight of which have persisted): Dean ofthe Faculty 1883 Dean of the Graduate School 1901 Dean of the Departments of Science 1909-1928 Dean ofthe College 1909 Dean of the School of Engineering 1922 Dean of Freshmen 1925-1943 Dean ofthe Chapel 1928 Dean of Students (later Dean of Student Affairs) 1954 Dean ofthe Woodrow Wilson School 1964 Dean ofthe School of Architecture 1965 The Chairman of the University Re\u00ad search Board (1959), while not called a dean, is accorded rank equivalent to a dean by the trustee bylaws. The work of deans is arduous and sometines invidious (President Mc- Cosh's word for it), but some forty persons who have been deans have generally shown staying power and de\u00ad votion. Given their stature, it is re\u00ad markable that so few of them have gone on to college or university presi\u00ad dencies\u2014Luther P. Eisenhart received seven presidential calls during his sev\u00ad eral deanships, and it is probable that every dean has received at least one call. Deans are generally held in high re\u00ad gard, and their title considered an hon\u00ad orable one, though Dean McClenahan once announced that he preferred to be called \"mister\"\u2014having just read in the Times that the police had picked up the dean of New York pickpockets. To fill its deanships the University has raided the English and physics de\u00ad partments more frequently than any others. Longest terms have been com\u00ad pleted by Andrew West (Graduate School), 27 years; Henry B. Fine (Fac\u00ad ulty, Departments of Science), 25 years; Christian Gauss (College), 21 years; J. Douglas Brown (Faculty), 21 years; Luther P. Eisenhart (Faculty, Graduate School), 20 years; Arthur M. Greene, Jr. (School of Engineering), 19 years; Robert R. Wicks (Chapel), 19 years. Dean of the Chapel has charge of the services and the preaching in the Uni\u00ad versity Chapel and general supervision of religious activities of the University. Incumbents have been: Robert R. Wicks 1928-1947 Donald B. Aldrich 1947-1955 Ernest Gordon 1955- Dean of the College is an office which came into being in the spring of 1909 when President Wilson recommended to the trustees that the superintend\u00ad ence of discipline previously vested in the dean of the faculty be vested in a new dean to be called the dean of disci\u00ad pline. By the time the name ofthe first incumbent appeared in the catalogue that fall, his title had become dean of the college. In 1946 the dean ofthe col\u00ad lege was made responsible for the en\u00ad forcement of rules relating to under\u00ad graduate scholastic standing, and for oversight of the services and agencies designed to promote the academic de\u00ad velopment of undergraduates; in 1954, responsibility for undergraduate disci\u00ad pline and extracurricular activities (and in 1957 athletic activities) was assigned to a new officer, the dean of students. Occupants of the office of dean of the college have been: Edward G. Elliott (politics) 1909-1912 Howard McClenahan (physics) 1912-1925 DEAN OF THE FACULTY 129 Christian Gauss (modern languages) 1925-1946 Francis R. B. Godolphin (classics) 1946-1955 Jeremiah S. Finch (English) 1955-1961 J. Merrill Knapp (music) 1961-1966 Edward D. Sullivan (French) 1966-1972 Neil L. Rudenstine (English) 1972-1977 Joan S. Girgus (psychology) 1977- Dean of the Departments of Science was a title borne by only one man, Henry B. Fine. He was appointed to the post in 1909 and held it until his death in 1928. This deanship was created by the trustees at President Wilson's request to provide general administrative oversight of the De\u00ad partments of Mathematics, Physics, As\u00ad tronomy, Chemistry, Biology, and Geology, and of the development of in\u00ad struction in various fields of engineer\u00ad ing. After Dean Fine's death, these duties were assigned to the dean of the faculty. Dean of the Faculty, oldest and high\u00ad est-ranking deanship, was established by the trustees in 1883 as a means of re\u00ad leasing the incumbent president, James McCosh, then seventy-two years old, from certain onerous duties, and of thus persuading him to remain as president as well as professor of philosophy. A by-law adopted by the trustees charged the dean of the faculty \"with oversight of whatever does not pertain directly to the work of instruction, such in particu\u00ad lar as the discipline of the College, the assignment of rooms and the sanitary condition of the Institution.\" As thus defined, this continued to be the dean of the faculty's function until 1909 when, with the creation of the office of the dean of the college, his original duties were assigned to the new dean, and the dean of the faculty took over from the president the administrative oversight of the application and en\u00ad forcement of rules and standards of scholarship in the University, the chairmanship ex-officio of the faculty committee on examinations and stand\u00ad ing, and the responsibility of discharg\u00ad ing the general duties of the president in his absence or disability. During the post-World War II years, as the dean of the college assumed in\u00ad creasing responsibility for the academic life of undergraduates, the dean of the faculty shared with the president in\u00ad creasing responsibility for oversight of departments of instruction and concern for the well-being of the faculty. In 1967, the incumbent of the newly created office of provost took over from the dean of the faculty the responsibil\u00ad ity of acting for the president, in his ab\u00ad sence or disability, in the general supervision of the University. Deans of the faculty have been: James O. Murray (English) 1883-1899 Samuel R. Winans (Greek) 1899-1903 Henry B. Fine (mathematics) 1903-1912 William F. Magie (physics) 1912-1925 Luther P. Eisenhart (mathematics) 1925-1933 Robert K. Root (English) 1933-1946 J. Douglas Brown (economics) 1946-1967 Robert R. Palmer (history) 1967-1968 Richard A. Lester (economics) 1968-1973 Aaron Lemonick (physics) 1973-130 DEAN OF FRESHMEN Dean of Freshmen, 1925-1942, was Radcliffe Heermance who was also di\u00ad rector of admission. As dean of freshmen he was charged with adminis\u00ad trative oversight of the academic work of the freshman class and direction of the board of advisors. Burnham N. Dell was dean of freshmen for one year 1942-1943. Thereafter, the duties of this office were absorbed by the staff of the dean of the college. Dean of the Graduate School, second oldest deanship, was established in 1901. Its incumbent is responsible, under the president, for graduate studies, for the curriculum of the Graduate School and for the residential Graduate College.

Incumbents of this office have been: CHAIRMAN OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE Harold W. Dodds 1930-1933 DIRECTOR DeWitt C. Poole 1933-1939 Dana G. Munro 1939-1958 Gardner Patterson 1958-1963 Lester V. Chandler 1963-1964 DEAN Marver H. Bernstein 1964-1969 John P. Lewis 1969-1974 Donald E. Stokes 1974- Degrees awarded by American colleges in the colonial period were adopted from those then in use at Oxford and Cambridge. The original charter that King George II granted Princeton in 1746 empowered the trustees \"for the encouragement of learning and animat\u00ad ing the students . . . to diligence, in\u00ad and a . . as are usually granted in either of our universities or in any other college in our realm of Great Britain.\" The chief degree so adopted was the Bachelor of Arts. In the medieval uni\u00ad versities it had been a preliminary de\u00ad gree, enabling the holder to proceed to the masters degree, which alone en\u00ad abled him to teach. The word bachelor was derived from the medieval Latin baccalarius, which had been applied in the eighth century to rustics, male and female, who were of low rank in the feudal hierarchy. The word was later extended to persons of subordinate po\u00ad sitions in other systems: knighthood, the church, trade guilds, univer\u00ad sities, and finally, by its last exten\u00ad sion, to unmarried men who presum\u00ad ably were still novices in the ways of the world generally. On the continent the bachelor's de\u00ad gree continued to be an obscure way station on the road to the master's de\u00ad gree and later to the doctor's degree. But in England the bachelor's degree became the important one, and at Ox\u00ad ford and Cambridge the master's de\u00ad gree could be obtained several years after graduation merely by the payment of a few pounds. Similarly, a Princeton bachelor of arts could obtain a master's degree three years after his graduation simply by certifying that he had en\u00ad gaged in such professional studies as \"divinity, law, or physick\" and submit\u00ad ting \"testimonials of good moral con\u00ad duct signed by two or more gentlemen of Note and Veracity.\" This practice continued until the end of the nineteenth century when a more rigor\u00ad ous administration of higher degrees was instituted. OTHER BACHELOR DEGREES In addition to the time-honored Bachelor of Arts, other bachelor de\u00ad grees have been offered at Princeton as follows: Bachelor of Laws from 1847 to 1852; Bachelor of Science from 1873 to 1930; Bachelor of Letters from 1904 to 1918; Bachelor of Science in Engineer\u00ad ing since 1921. The law degree was conferred on seven persons who completed a short\u00ad lived law course begun at the time of the College's centennial celebration. The Bachelor of Science degree was introduced in the 1870s with the expan\u00ad sion of the science curriculum. Candi\u00ad dates for this degree were required at entrance to offer Latin but not Greek, although both languages were still re\u00ad quired for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. It was later found that some stu\u00ad dents became candidates for the Bachelor of Science degree to flee Greek rather than to pursue science. In 1904, the Bachelor of Letters degree 132 DEGREES was accordingly introduced to distin\u00ad guish students who wished to take a humanistic program without Greek from those who were really pursuing scientific programs. The Litt. B. De\u00ad gree was discontinued in 1918 when Greek was dropped as an admission re\u00ad quirement for the Bachelor of Arts de\u00ad gree. At the same time, Latin was dropped as an entrance requirement for the Bachelor of Science degree but was retained for the Bachelor of Arts. This difference led to another anomaly, which came to light after the introduc\u00ad tion of the four-course plan in 1923. It was found not uncommon for a B. S. candidate to major in art and archaeol\u00ad ogy or English, or for an A. B. candidate to concentrate in chemistry or biology, so that the difference in the degree re\u00ad lated more to what the student had studied in secondary school than to what he had done in college. It was de\u00ad cided in 1930 that, in view of the non\u00ad technical nature of undergraduate study in all the liberal arts and sciences, the same degree would be appropriate for work in every department. Begin\u00ad ning then, the degree of Bachelor of Arts was awarded in all departments except engineering, and the Latin en\u00ad trance requirement was eliminated. ENGINEERING DEGREES From the time of their founding, the Departments of Civil Engineering (1875) and Electrical Engineering (1889) offered separate degrees (C.E. and E.E.). With the establishment of the School of Engineering in 1921, the first degree for all engineering depart\u00ad ments was made Bachelor of Science in Engineering and the second degree, Master of Science in Engineering. GRADUATE DEGREES Modern graduate degrees were in\u00ad troduced in the 1870s with the inaugu\u00adration of postgraduate study under President McCosh. At first there were two master's degrees\u2014Master of Arts and Master of Science\u2014and two doc\u00ad tor's degrees\u2014Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor of Science (in the early 1890s the degree of Doctor of Letters was given twice); but by 1905 the other degrees were discontinued, leaving only two degrees, Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy, regularly offered for work in the liberal arts and sciences. Other degrees at the Master's level have been offered as follows: Master of Fine Arts, in architecture from 1919 to 1970, in art and archaeology since 1919, in music since 1940; Master in Public Affairs since 1948; Master of Architec\u00ad ture since 1970; Master of Architecture and Urban Planning since 1970; Master in Public Affairs and Urban Planning since 1971. In medieval universities the term doctor was introduced some time after master. Master and doctor were at first used synonymously, but in time master came to be restricted to the teachers of liberal arts and doctor, as a distinction, to the teachers of theology and law, and later of medicine. In Germany, doctor eventually came to be applied to ad\u00ad vanced degrees in all faculties and it was the German system that was adopted generally in the United States. At Princeton the A.M. degree was often sought by those looking forward to secondary school teaching or writing or the diplomatic service, but in time it became, for the most part, a way station on the road to the doctorate. The Ph.D. became the degree for college and uni\u00ad versity teaching and for research in all the arts and sciences as well as in ar\u00ad chitecture, engineering, public affairs, and urban planning. The following table shows the number of degrees conferred at Princeton's first Commencement in DEPARTMENTS OF INSTRUCTION 133 1748, at fifty-year intervals thereafter until 1898, and 1748 1798 1848 1898 1923 1948 1973 hrs 6 14 74 189 383 578 920 ters \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 47 68 222 301 tors \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1 18 55 225 Total 6 14 74 237 469 855 1446 NOTE: These figures are exclusive of honorary degrees (q.v.). Departments of instruction in the arts and sciences were first established at Princeton in 1904 as part of the reor\u00ad ganization of the curriculum that began soon after President Wilson's inaugura\u00ad tion in 1902. Previously, the individual professor had presented his course proposals directly to the faculty after consultation with the president and other colleagues. With the increase in the faculty required for the introduc\u00ad tion of Wilson's preceptorial system, and the greater complexity of the cur\u00ad riculum, organization of the faculty by departments became indispensable, and the University accordingly drew \"the several chairs in related subjects of study\" into the following eleven guages; Philosophy; Physics. These were in addition to two existing de\u00ad partments of civil and electrical en\u00ad gineering. (Astronomy, one of Prince\u00ad ton's oldest disciplines, became a de\u00ad partment a few years later.) After 1904, through various evolu\u00ad tionary processes, the number of de\u00ad partments more than doubled. History, Politics, and Economics became sepa\u00ad rate departments, and later Economics generated Sociology, which in turn produced Anthropology, Modern Lan\u00ad guages and Literatures separated into Germanic, Romance, and Slavic Lan\u00ad guages and Literatures, and a new de\u00ad partment of Oriental Studies sub\u00ad sequently divided into East Asian and Near Eastern Studies. Psychology and Statistics, originally subfields of Philos\u00ad ophy and Mathematics, became sepa\u00ad rate departments. Other new depart\u00ad ments were added after a period of incubation under the wing of another department (Music), of a faculty com\u00ad mittee (Religion), or of the Council of the Humanities. (Comparative Litera\u00ad ture). Biochemical Sciences was devel\u00ad oped by the two departments from which it derived its name. By these dif\u00ad ferent means the number of separate departments in the arts and sciences had grown to twenty-six by 1976. In addition, two of the three profes\u00ad sional schools\u2014the School of Architec\u00ad ture and Urban Planning (1919) and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs (1930)\u2014have func\u00ad tioned as departments; and the School of Engineering and Applied Science (1921), has embraced the four depart\u00ad ments of Aerospace and Mechanical Sciences; Chemical Engineering; Civil Engineering; and Electrical Engineer\u00ad ing and Computer Science. Thus, by 1977, the total number of academic de\u00ad partments came to thirty-two. Articles about these departments and schools will be found under the appro\u00ad priate headings. Another related academic resource, which the University has been develop\u00ad ing with increasing effectiveness since the late 1930s, brings together faculty members from different departments in interdisciplinary programs of instruc-134 JONATHAN DICKINSON almost as many programs as depart\u00ad ments. A few of them are described in separate articles: Afro-American Stud\u00ad ies, American Studies, Creative Arts, History and Philosophy of Science, Linguistics, Teacher Preparation. Other programs range from Applied Mathematics, Classical Archaeology, and Demography to Neuroscience, Political Philosophy, and Transporta\u00ad tion, and include, for example, interna\u00ad tional and regional study of Africa, East Asia, Latin America, Modern Europe, the Near East, and Russia. Other interdepartmental committees have functioned without the formal structure of a program, as in the case of the Women's Studies Committee, which encourages interdisciplinary consideration of the role of women in various societies and of the changing nature of social and political relation\u00ad ships between men and women. Further aids to interdisciplinary study have been provided by councils that coordinate the activities of pro\u00ad grams in their areas. The oldest and the largest is the Council of the Humanities which is described in a separate article. Created more recently have been councils on Environmental, Interna\u00ad tional and Regional, and Urban Studies, and the Council of Masters, which coordinates the educational ob\u00ad jectives of the various undergraduate dining and residential units. Another vital element in the aca\u00ad demic structure of the University is the special research unit. Some of the older ones, described in separate articles, in\u00ad clude Industrial Relations, Interna\u00ad tional Finance, International Studies, and Population Research. Other fields in which special research programs have been created include Chinese Linguistics, Criminal Justice, Devel\u00ad opment Studies, Econometric Re\u00ad search, Financial Research, New Jersey Affairs, and Urban and Environmental Planning. Dickinson, Jonathan (1688-1747), Princeton's first president, died after only four and a half months in office and is chiefly remembered for having been the leader of the little group who, in his words, \"first concocted the plan and foundation of the College.\" To him, \"more than to any other man, the lege . . . owes its origin,\" wrote Profes\u00ad sor William A. Packard in The Princeton Book (1879). Born in Hatfield, Massachusetts, Dickinson was a member of the fifth class to graduate, in 1706, from the Col\u00ad legiate School of Connecticut, which later changed its name to Yale College. He studied theology and in 1709, when he was twenty-one, was ordained minister of the church in Elizabeth- town (now Elizabeth), New Jersey. Dickinson served this church all his life, ministering to his flock as pastor, lawyer, physician and, in later years, as an instructor of young men preparing for professional study. Besides Eliza- bethtown, his field of labor embraced the outlying towns of Rahway, West- field, Connecticut Farms, Springfield, and a part of Chatham. At one time, when diphtheria became epidemic, he was called to visit a family that lost eight of its ten children in two weeks, and, finding one of the children \"newly dead,\" had the advantage of postmor\u00ad tem examination and \"thereby a better acquaintance with the Nature of the Disease.\" He published a paper, Ob\u00ad servations on That Terrible Disease, Vulgarly Called The Throat Distemper, which according to a latter-day histo\u00ad rian of medicine, \"evidenced a mind skilled in the appreciation of morbid phenomena . . . and an enlarged JONATHAN DICKINSON 135 knowledge, for his time, of the princi\u00ad ples of cure.\" The Elizabethtown church was origi\u00ad nally Congregational, as was Dickin\u00ad son, but because he felt a need for stronger ties with other churches in meeting the Church of England's oppo\u00ad sition to New Jersey dissenters, he per\u00ad suaded his congregation in 1717 to change its form of government and place itself under the care of the Pres\u00ad bytery of Philadelphia. Dickinson be\u00ad came a leader of this presbytery and also of the higher ecclesiastical body of which it was a member\u2014the Synod of Philadelphia, which twice elected him moderator. As a former Congregationalist he exerted a moderating influence on the deliberations of his Presbyterian col\u00ad leagues. In 1721 he protested an action of the synod that he thought exceeded its legitimate powers. The following year, he presented a paper on \"the true limits of church power\" so persuasively that the synod adopted it unanimously and then closed the meeting with \"joy\u00ad ful singing\" from the 133rd Psalm: \"Be\u00ad hold, how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!\" In 1729 Dickinson opposed a pro\u00ad posal that every minister in the Synod of Philadelphia should be required \"to give his hearty assent\" to the West\u00ad minster Confession of Faith. While personally accepting the doctrine set forth in the Confessions and Catech\u00ad isms of the Westminster Assembly, Dickinson held on principle that the imposition of any creed was an in\u00ad fringement of the individual clergy\u00ad man's rights. At the same time Dickinson de\u00ad fended Presbyterianism from external criticism, publishing frequent articles in this cause. These earned him a reputation second only to Jonathan Edward's as a champion of Calvinism in America and as a writer on divinity. A century later, President Maclean wrote that \"for profound thinking, but not always correct [italics his], he would assign the palm to Edwards; but for sound judgment and practical wisdom, to Dickinson.\" Dickinson's best-known book, Familiar Letters to a Gentleman, upon a Variety of Seasonable and Im\u00ad portant Subjects in Religion, was fre\u00ad quently reprinted both here and abroad. Dickinson was one of the leaders of a movement to found a \"seminary of learning\" in the Synod of Philadelphia. He and Ebenezer Pemberton, pastor of the Presbyterian Church in New York, were members of a committee ap\u00ad pointed in 1739 to plan a fund-raising expedition to Great Britain for this purpose, but their plans had to be ta\u00ad bled when war broke out between Eng\u00ad land and Spain. Meanwhile, the influence of the Great Awakening (see The Founding of Princeton) brought a division between the \"New Sides\" and the \"Old Sides\" in the Presbyterian Church. Dickinson and his associates in the Presbytery of New York, which he had helped form in 1738, were moderate New Siders who, while encouraging revivals, op\u00ad posed their more violent excesses. They nevertheless defended the rights of the more zealous graduates of the Log College (q.v.) in their disputes with the Old Sides. When the Log College-dominated Presbytery of New Brunswick was expelled from the Synod of Philadelphia in 1741, and Dickinson and his associates were un\u00ad able to bring about a reconciliation, they withdrew in 1745 to form, in association with the Presbytery of New Brunswick, the Synod of New York, and Dickinson was elected the first moderator. Dickinson now revived his earlier interest in a much-needed college 136 DICKINSON HALL for the Middle Colonies. He was dis\u00ad appointed by Harvard's and Yale's op\u00ad position to the revival meetings of George Whitefield and by Yale's harsh treatment of his young friend, David Brainerd, who was dismissed because of his outspoken opposition to the fac\u00ad ulty's conservative religious views. He also felt that the course of instruction offered by the Log College was in\u00ad adequate. It was against this background that Dickinson and three other pastors\u2014 Pemberton, Aaron Burr Sr., and John Pierson\u2014and the three laymen whose support they enlisted\u2014William Brugh Livingston, and Wil\u00ad liam Peartree Smith\u2014began to plan the founding of the College (q.v.). Led by Dickinson, this group applied in vain to Governor Lewis Morris for a charter and, following his death, renewed their application to Acting Governor John Hamilton, who granted a charter on October 22, 1746. The first trustees, including five Log College adherents enlisted by Dickin\u00ad son and Pemberton, announced Dick\u00ad inson's appointment as president in April 1747. Classes began the fourth week in May in Elizabethtown, with a student body of eight or ten members. One of Dickinson's divinity students, Caleb Smith, served as tutor and the parsonage served as the College\u2014the only library available was Dickinson's, the classroom was probably his parlor, and the refectory his dining room. But the first months of the College's life were the last of Dickinson's. His sud\u00ad den death on October 7, 1747, was re\u00ad ported in The New York Weekly Post Boy by his long-time coworker for the College, Ebenezer Pemberton: Elizabethtown in New Jersey, October 10 On Wednesday morning last, about four o'clock, died here, of a pleuritic illness, that eminently learned and pious minister of the Gospel and President of the College of New Jersey, the Rev. Mr. Jona\u00ad than Dickinson, in the sixtieth year of his age, who had been Pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in this Town for nearly forty years, and was the Glory and Joy of it. In him con\u00ad spicuously appeared those natural and acquired moral and spiritual En\u00ad dowments which constitute a truly excellent and valuable man, a good Scholar, an eminent Divine, and a serious, devout Christian . . . By his death our Infant College is deprived of the Benefit and Advantage of his superior Accomplishments. . . . Never any Person in these Parts died more lamented. The portrait of President Dickinson in the Faculty Room in Nassau Hall was copied from an engraving prefixed to the Glasgow edition of his Familiar Letters and was presented to the Col\u00ad lege by the artist, Edward Ludlow Mooney, in 1872. Dickinson Hall, home of the Depart\u00ad ments of Economics and of History, is named for the first president of the Col\u00ad lege, Jonathan Dickinson. Built in 1930 as an extension of the wing of McCosh Hall on Washington Road and con\u00ad nected with the University Chapel by the Rothschild Arch, it completed the great court of which the Chapel and McCosh form two sides. Dickinson replaced an earlier recita\u00ad tion and lecture hall of the same name, which stood for fifty years at the south\u00ad west corner of the site now occupied by Firestone Library and was lost in 1920 in the fire that also destroyed Mar- quand Chapel. HAROLD WILLIS DODDS 137 Dillon Gymnasium, designed by Aymar Embury 1900, was built in 1947 on the site of the University Gym\u00ad nasium (destroyed by fire in 1944), and named in honor of Herbert L. Dillon 07, onetime football captain and a principal donor to the building fund. Dillon contains all of the facilities of its predecessor plus a six-lane pool, which is used for intercollegiate competition as well as for intramural purposes. Since Jadwin Gymnasium (q.v.) was built, the main part of Dillon has been used chiefly for classes in physical education and as a supplement to Jad\u00ad win for intramural sports. Dod HaU, named for Professor Albert Baldwin Dod (1805-1845), was given to Princeton by his sister, Mrs. David B. Brown, who also donated Brown Hall (q.v.). Both dormitory buildings were designed by John Lyman Faxon in an Italian Renaissance style. A precocious student, Dod entered the College when he was fifteen, graduated two years later in 1822, and was appointed professor of mathematics when he was twenty-five. John Mac\u00ad lean said he was unsurpassed as a teacher of this subject. Dod also taught political economy and architecture and was regarded by his students as one of their most stimulating teachers in these subjects as well. Professor Dod is also remembered by a professorship of mathematics, en\u00ad dowed in 1869 by his son, Dodds, Harold Willis (1889- ) fif\u00ad teenth president of Princeton, was born in Utica, Pennsylvania, on June 28, 1889. His father, a Presbyterian minis\u00ad ter, was professor of Bible at Grove City College in Pennsylvania, and Harold Dodds spent most of his youth on or near the college campus. He grad\u00ad uated from Grove City in 1909 and, after teaching school for two years, did graduate work in politics at Princeton (M.A. 1914) and Pennsylvania (Ph.D. 1917). He celebrated his doctorate by marrying Margaret Murray of Halifax on Christmas Day, 1917. During the war he served in the Food Administra\u00ad tion, and then (1919-1920) taught at Western Reserve. He had already gained a reputation as an expert on problems of local government, and in 1920 he became secretary of the Na\u00ad tional Municipal League, a post he held until 1928. The president of the league was the secretary of state, Charles Evans Hughes. Hughes formed a high opinion of his young executive officer and got him involved in the electoral problems of Latin America. As adviser to the president of Nicaragua, Dodds drafted the Nicaraguan electoral law of 1923 and helped supervise the remarkably peaceful and honest elections of 1928. In between, he was advisor to the commission that vainly sought to ar\u00ad range a plebiscite that would end the long dispute between Chile and Peru over the provinces of Tacna and Arica. During this period, Dodds gave lec\u00ad ture courses at various eastern colleges. In 1925 he joined the Princeton Fac\u00ad ulty. He was promoted to full professor in 1927, and in 1930 was appointed chairman of the newly established School of Public Affairs (now the Wood- row Wilson School). During his chair\u00ad manship, he and his colleagues made an intensive survey of the government of New Jersey. They found much room for improvement in the administration of the state, and some of their recom\u00ad mendations were actually put into effect\u2014an unusual event in the history of such reports. 138 HAROLD WILLIS DODDS Thus when the trustees chose Harold Dodds as president of Princeton in 1933, they were selecting a scholar who had had wide experience in administra\u00ad tion and in public and international af\u00ad fairs. They were also selecting the youngest president of Princeton in over a century, which was just as well, con\u00ad sidering the problems that had to be met during the next two decades. The Great Depression, the Second World War, and the postwar period of read\u00ad justment put severe and continuing strains on the University and its presi\u00ad dent. Not until 1950 did Princeton have what might be called a normal year, with adequate income, a large enough faculty, and neither too few nor too many students. Just to have kept the University going during these troubled times would have seemed a satisfactory achievement to many men. Dodds did far more. The intellectual level of the University and the breadth of its inter\u00ad ests increased steadily during his presi\u00ad dency. He had a remarkable talent for recognizing excellence. Bright young men were quickly promoted; first-rate scholars were attracted from other in\u00ad stitutions; new departments and pro\u00ad grams were created. He depended heavily, of course, on the advice of deans and department chairmen, but they gave him good advice because they knew that he would back them to the limit when they had good candi\u00ad dates, and that he had a sure instinct for detecting mediocrity. He could help lure a Jacob Viner from Chicago to strengthen the Department of Eco\u00ad nomics, and he could also see why Classics needed to promote a young in\u00ad structor named Robert Goheen. The creation of new departments and programs and the growth of a profes\u00ad sional staff made it especially important to pay careful attention to appoint\u00ad ments and promotions. The develop\u00ad ment of the Music Department (1934), the Office of Population Research (1936), the Creative Arts Program (1939), the Departments of Reli\u00ad gion (1940), Aeronautical Engineering (1941), and Near Eastern Studies (1947), the great postwar expansion of the Woodrow Wilson School and of sponsored research programs vastly in\u00ad creased the size of the faculty and pro\u00ad fessional staff. A few figures will show the rate of growth: 1933 1941 1946 1956 Faculty 327 391 514 582 Professional staff 237 Total 819 3584 It should also be noticed that the ratio of teachers to students increased stead\u00ad ily (except for the postwar bulge of 1946). The war years were especially dif\u00ad ficult. Princeton adopted an acceler\u00ad ated program to give its students an opportunity to graduate before they en\u00ad tered the armed services. At the same time the army and navy sent hundreds of young men to the campus for general or specialized training. The number of students fluctuated widely from month to month. A faculty depleted by enlist\u00ad ments or calls to government service had to teach unfamiliar subjects at break-neck speed. Yet the basic ideals of a Princeton education were main\u00ad tained and a remarkably high percent\u00ad age of undergraduates who had left the University for military service returned after the war. During all this turmoil Dodds re-HAROLD WILLIS DODDS 139 mained steadfast in his belief in the value of liberal studies, and his convic\u00ad tion helped to steady the University. He made an effort to keep in touch with students in the services and strength\u00ad ened their desire to return to college. At the end of the war he set up the Princeton Program for Servicemen, which made it easy for men to resume their education almost as soon as they were discharged. Just as the University was adjusting to the return of students and faculty from the war, came the two-hundredth anniversary of the founding of Prince\u00ad ton. The year 1946-1947 was celebrated by an almost continuous series of scholarly conferences and three major convocations. Over a thousand scholars and men of affairs from all parts of the world attended these meetings. They helped to renew bonds broken by the war and to indicate the tasks to be undertaken by the new generation of scholars. As a continuing memorial of the anniversary, Bicentennial Precep- torships were established to give the most promising young assistant profes\u00ad sors a year of free time for research. Increasing the size and quality of the faculty was expensive. Improving re\u00ad tirement benefits and building new housing for the faculty was also expen\u00ad sive. Even more costly were badly needed additions to the physical plant. The Dillon Gymnasium (1947) replaced the old gym, destroyed in a disastrous fire. The Firestone Library (1948) gave students in the humanities and the so\u00ad cial sciences an almost ideal place to do their work. The acquisition of the For- restal Campus (formerly part of the Rockefeller Center for Medical Re\u00ad search) in 1941, gave engineering and nuclear physics badly needed space. Woodrow Wilson Hall (now Corwin Hall) provided a home for the Wood-row Wilson School. New dormitories took care of the growing student popu\u00ad lation. To meet these expenses a constant search for money was required. Annual Giving started modestly in 1941 but soon became a major source of income ($80,000 in 1941, $1,281,000 in 1957). Dodds's request in 1938 for an increase in the number of endowed professor\u00ad ships was remarkably successful. Thirty new endowed professorships were es\u00ad tablished during his administration, almost doubling the number and more than doubling the income from this source. The windfall of the Higgins Trust (shared with Yale, Harvard, and Columbia) took some of the strain off the budget for the science depart\u00ad ments. But, as always, it was the loyal support of alumni and friends who be\u00ad lieved in the aims and achievements of the University that carried Princeton through a period of inflation and grow\u00ad ing expenditures. As Princeton grew, both physically and in intellectual stature, the task of administering the University became more complicated. Harold Dodds grew with the job; he was never over\u00ad whelmed by new problems or new re\u00ad sponsibilities. He saw opportunities, not threats, in changes in American life, as he made clear in his little book, Out of This Nettle, Danger . . . (Princeton 1943). His quiet confidence gave confidence to others, and his sense of humor kept him from becom\u00ad ing dogmatic and inflexible. He could say of the alumni that their tradition of pressing advice on the president began when Benjamin Rush (1760) told With- erspoon what to do, of the faculty that in their relations with him they had displayed a \"tolerance that often rose to the level of true Christian charity,\" of the students \"that when young people 140 HAROLD WILLIS DODDS start to think for themselves they al\u00ad ways cause pain to their elders.\" Few university presidents of his generation had his stamina and his experience. It was fitting that after his retirement the Carnegie Foundation asked him to undertake a study which produced the book The Academic President\u2014Edu\u00ad cator or Caretaker? Harold Dodds stated his beliefs about the role of the University most clearly at the final Bicentennial Convo\u00ad cation on June 17, 1947: Princeton enters her third century with certain convictions as to what she wants her future to be. We shall uphold the banner of the general as the only safe foundation for the par\u00ad ticular. We shall strive for quality rather than quantity; we have no illu\u00ad sions of grandeur that bigness will satisfy. As a residential university, we shall emphasize the community of students and teachers, believing that the life of the campus is a potent supplement to formal study and in\u00ad struction. We shall always see to it that our students represent a demo\u00ad cratic cross-section of American youth, geographically and with re\u00ad spect to economic circumstance. We shall strive to develop mental profi\u00ad ciency, and to this end work to main\u00ad tain the highest scholastic standards, but we shall not forget that moral proficiency must be cultivated as well. We shall seek to advance learn\u00ad ing as well as disseminate it. We shall remember that we were founded by God-fearing men and we shall strive to communicate to our students the sense of duty that made our forebears strong. As she crosses the threshold of a new and fateful age, Princeton will strive to meet any challenge, to dare any adventure to preserve her integ\u00ad rity and to further her enduring pur\u00ad pose. Proud as we are of our history and grateful for the strength our her\u00ad itage brings to us, we know that to rest on it can lead only to decay and destruction. We intend to be the progenitors of a stronger Princeton, not merely the beneficiaries of gen\u00ad erations that went before us. To sum up, theDodds years were the years in which Princeton became a real university, a major contributor to knowledge and understanding through\u00ad out the world. They were also years in which teaching, and especially the teaching of undergraduates, reached new levels of excellence. Departmental and interdepartmental programs be\u00ad came broader, deeper, and more flexi\u00ad ble. Wilson had set the goal of combin\u00ad ing high scholarship and first-rate teaching. When he retired in June 1957, Harold Dodds had come nearer to realizing this difficult combination than any of his predecessors. As the faculty said in an address to the presi\u00ad dent, read at the last faculty meeting over which he presided: You have steadfastly adhered to the belief that the ideal member of the Faculty is one who can both commu\u00ad nicate and add to the knowledge of his subject. In maintaining this prin\u00ad ciple you have helped us to create a community of teacher-scholars which is the envy of other institutions. Princeton has grown, during your Presidency, in all the things which make a university\u2014in intellectual eminence and in influence on our so\u00ad ciety. It is a better place for scholars to do their work than it was when you became President, and we are grate\u00ad ful for all that you have done to make it so. The years of your administra-DODGE-OSBORN HALL tion will long be remembered as a great period in the history of Princeton. Joseph R. Strayer Dodge Gateway, standing between 1901 and Henry Dormitories, was given in 1933 by Mr. and Mrs. Marcel- lus Hartley Dodge in memory of their son, Marcellus Hartley Dodge, Jr., '30, who was killed in an automobile acci\u00ad dent in France soon after his graduation from Princeton; inscribed on the Gate\u00ad way are these words from Jeremiah: His sun is gone down While it was yet day Dodge-Osborn Hall (1960), which is part of Woodrow Wilson College (q.v.) bears the names of two New York families with many Princeton associa\u00ad tions. It was given in memory of Cleve\u00ad land H. Dodge 1879 and William Church Osborn 1883 (hon. LL. D. 1942) by members of their families and by the Cleveland H. Dodge Foundation. THE DODGES Cleveland H. Dodge (1860-1926) was the son of William Earl Dodge, Jr., in\u00ad dustrialist and philanthropist, whose father was one of the founders of Phelps, Dodge, and Company, dealers in copper and other metals, one of the organizers of the Young Men's Chris\u00ad tian Association in America, and a lib\u00ad eral benefactor of a college, later the American University of Beirut, which was founded by another son, D. Stuart Dodge. Cleveland H. Dodge succeeded his father as national president of the Y.M.C.A. and was for many years pres\u00ad ident of the trustees of Robert College 141 in Istanbul. He and his father gave Dodge Hall in memory of his brother, W. Earl Dodge 1879, who died a few years after graduation (see Murray- Dodge). Cleveland H. Dodge was a trustee of Princeton and a liberal con\u00ad tributor to its funds during the presi\u00ad dency of his classmate Woodrow Wil\u00ad son. He was also the largest contributor to Wilson's presidential campaign funds in 1912 and 1916. During the First World War he directed the United War Work Campaign, which raised $170,000,000 for the Y.M.C.A., the Knights of Columbus, the Salvation Army, and other relief organizations. He also headed campaigns for the Red Cross, the Y.M.C.A. and repeated ap\u00ad peals for relief of sufferers in the Near East. To all of these charities he was himself a liberal contributor. In 1918 he sent his check for $1,000,000 to the Red Cross, and that same year, outbidding all other competitors, paid the Red Cross $55,000 for the presidential proc\u00ad lamation of its appeal bearing the per\u00ad sonal signature of his old classmate. Cleveland H. Dodge's twin sons dis\u00ad tinguished themselves in education and philanthropy. Bayard Dodge 09 (hon. D. D. 1928) was president of the Uni\u00ad versity of Beirut in Lebanon and after his retirement, a lecturer in Princeton's Department of Near Eastern studies. Cleveland E. Dodge '09 (hon. Phil.D. 1959) was president of the Near East Foundation, chairman of the board of trustees of Teachers College of Colum\u00ad bia University, a leader and benefactor of the Y.M.C.A., and an alumni trustee of Princeton. In 1972, in recognition of Bayard and Cleveland E. Dodge's serv\u00ad ice to Princeton and the Near East, members of their families established twin chairs in the University's Depart\u00ad ment of Near Eastern Studies bearing their names. 142 GEORGE ECKEL DUCKWORTH THE OSBOBNS William Church Osborn 1883 (1862- 1951) was the son of William Henry Osborn, railroad president and philan\u00ad thropist and one of the exposers of the Tweed Ring in New York City. His older brother, Henry Fairfield Osborn 1877, D. Sc. 1880 (hon. LL. D. 2), donor of the Osborn Clubhouse (q.v.), was Princeton's first professor of com\u00ad parative anatomy and later president of the American Museum of Natural His\u00ad tory in New York; one of his two Princeton sons, Fairfield Osborn '09 (hon. D. Sc. 1957) was president of the New York Zoological Society and a leading conservationist, widely known for his book, Our Plundered Vianet. A lawyer, William Church Osborn was generally regarded as one of New York's first citizens. Although he never ran for office, he was active in the po\u00ad litical life of his city and state, serving as organizer and president of the Soci\u00ad ety to Prevent Corrupt Practices at Elections, as chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee, as founder, president and chairman of the Citizens Budget Commission. He was for fifty years president or chairman of the board of the Children's Aid Society and was also president of the Met\u00ad ropolitan Museum of Art. A trustee of the University for almost forty years, he served as chairman of the Princeton Fund Committee for a decade, and was a principal organizer of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and Interna\u00ad tional Affairs. The trustees later created a professorship in the School in his memory. Mrs. William Church Osborn was a sister of Cleveland H. Dodge; she gave the Dodge Professorship of His\u00ad tory. The William Church Osborns had three Princeton sons, the eldest of whom, Frederick H. Osborn 10, was a major-general in charge of the army's educational program during the Second World War, deputy representative of the United States on the U.N. Atomic Energy Commission, president of the Population Council, and a trustee of the University during the administrations of Presidents Dodds and Goheen. By 1975, twenty-four members of four generations of the Dodge and Os\u00ad born families had attended Princeton. Douglass Service Award, The, was es\u00ad tablished in 1969 by the Association of Black Collegians and named for Freder\u00ad ick Douglass, the nineteenth-century black leader who \"epitomized in his life the revolution in the status of his race.\" It is presented annually to the student who \"exemplifies the courage, integ\u00ad rity, intellectual honesty, and moral behavior that gives dignity and sense of purpose to Negro youth across the na\u00ad tion, and in so doing acts in accordance with the academic tradition of prepara\u00ad tion for service embodied in the Princeton education.\" Recipients of the award during its early years were: Wil\u00ad liam Roderick Hamilton '69; Brent L. Henry '69; Howard W. Bell, Jr. '70; Leonard G. Brown '71; Jerome Davis '71; Roderick Plummer '72; Karl E. Michelle George Eckel (1903-1972), second Giger Professor of Latin, was associated with the University as stu\u00ad dent (A.B. 1924, Ph.D. 1931) and teacher for almost half a century. An authority on Roman comedy, es\u00ad pecially Plautus, and on Horace and Vergil, he was known among classical scholars the world over for his studies DULLES LIBRARY 143 of Vergil's use of the Golden Mean ratio in the Aeneid. He was one of the most productive scholars in the history of the Department of Classics. On his retire\u00ad ment in 1971, the department pub\u00ad lished and distributed to classical scholars here and abroad his bibliogra\u00ad phy, listing seven books and more than a hundred journal articles and reviews, and calling attention to hundreds of ar\u00ad ticles he had written for four encyclo\u00ad pedias. In tribute to his achievement, his colleagues quoted from Pliny: \". . . Ille thesaurus est [He is a storehouse of knowledge].\" His erudition, his enthusiasm for his subject, and his warm interest in his students made him an effective and popular teacher. When his last illness prevented him from meeting with classes, his undergraduate students helped him celebrate Vergil's 2000th birthday by coming to his house with a huge birthday cake and a commemora\u00ad tive scroll. Duckworth was a trustee of the American Academy in Rome, a Gug\u00ad genheim Fellow, and president of the American Philological Association. Dulles Library of Diplomatic History, a two-story hexagonal addition to the Firestone Library, was built at its southeast corner in 1962. It has a read\u00ad ing room on the ground floor and con\u00ad tains in stacks on the floor below, among other American historical manu\u00ad scripts, the personal papers of John Foster Dulles '08 (1888-1959), United States secretary of state from 1953 to 1959. The papers begin with the Hague Conference in 1907, which Dulles at\u00ad tended while an undergraduate, and extend over a period of more than fifty years, through the American Peace Commission after World War I, the founding of the United Nations after World War II, the Japanese Peace Treaty in 1951, and Dulles's years as President Eisenhower's secretary of state, to his death in 1959. During his first term as secretary of state, Dulles was persuaded by Presi\u00ad dent Dodds that Princeton would be the appropriate place for the preserva\u00ad tion of his personal papers, and in 1958 he worked out an agreement to this end. A year later, when Dulles became critically ill, Clarence Dillon, then under-secretary of state, and other friends and associates of the Secretary initiated a plan to donate an addition to the library to house the Dulles papers and stand as a tribute to him. A single letter from the original sponsors brought additional contributions from three hundred other friends and ad\u00ad mirers. \"This wonderful record of spon\u00ad taneous President Goheen reported at the ded\u00ad ication of the Dulles Library in 1962, \"was paralleled by the speed and grace with which the hexagonal addition to the Firestone Library was developed by the architects [R. B. O'Connor & W. H. Kilham]. One week following our meeting with the original sponsors, floor plans and elevations were ready, so that immediately thereafter Mr. Dillon and his associates were able to show Mr. Dulles, days before his death, sketches of the building almost exactly as it stands today.\" When the plans were shown to Dul\u00ad les, they were accompanied by a trib\u00ad ute which is recorded in one of the dis\u00ad play cases of the Dulles Library: In a troubled time, your unfalter\u00ad ing leadership and indomitable cour\u00ad age have given strength to the free world and, in future, when men live in peace, with freedom and justice, 144 EAST ASIAN STUDIES you will be remembered as a leading architect of that world. East Asian Studies at Princeton had their roots in the Department of Orien\u00ad tal Languages and Literatures, estab\u00ad lished in 1927 to coordinate graduate work in Semitic and Indo-European philology. An undergraduate program was not contemplated at that time. Un\u00ad dergraduates nevertheless had access to excellent courses in Chinese art taught by George Rowley, and in Far Eastern politics taught by Robert K. Reischauer, who was on the faculty of the Woodrow Wilson School at the time of his death in Shanghai in 1937, and by David Nelson Rowe, who later moved to Yale. After World War II social sci\u00ad ence of the Far East was further devel\u00ad oped with the appointments of William W. Lockwood in political economy and Marion J. Levy, Jr., in sociology. But although some hesitant steps to\u00ad ward language teaching were taken during and after World War II, it was not until the appointment in 1956 of Frederick W. Mote, a graduate of Nanking, that the Department of Oriential Studies, as it then was known, began regular work in Chinese. Work\u00ad ing with Ta-Tuan Chen, who joined him in 1959, Mote built a language program that trained students to utilize the formidable resources of the Gest Library (q.v.) and also to master the modern colloquial language. Later, Yu-Kung Kao came in Chinese litera\u00ad ture, permitting Mote to return to his own specialty of history, where he was joined in turn by James T. C. Liu. Work in Japanese began with the ap\u00ad pointment of Marius B. Jansen in his\u00ad tory in 1959; Japanese language and lit\u00ad erature were offered after 1960, and di\u00ad rected by John Nathan after 1973. Meanwhile, a number of other men and women came in Japanese studies to balance the strength the Chinese pro\u00ad gram had already shown. In 1961 an interdepartmental under\u00ad graduate program in East Asian Studies was set up under the direction of Jan\u00ad sen, and in 1969 the East Asian wing of the Department of Oriental Studies re\u00ad ceived independent status as the De\u00ad partment of East Asian Studies, also under his chairmanship. Later, Mote and Levy succeeded Jansen as chair\u00ad man. Generous financial support by John D. Rockefeller III (1961), the Ford Foundation (1961), the Carnegie Corporation (1963), the federal Office of Education (1965), and the government of Japan (1973) enabled the University to staff strong undergraduate and graduate programs that ranked with the best in the United States. A graduate program in Chinese and Japanese art and archaeology was estab\u00ad lished in 1958; Wen Fong and Shujiro Shimada made it the center for acquisi\u00ad tions and activities that produced hold\u00ad ings such as the Carter bronzes (1965) and exhibits recorded in publications like Traditions in Japanese Art (with Fogg Art Museum, Harvard, 1970) and Studies in Chinese Connoisseurship (Princeton, 1973). The Department of Religion began offering courses in Buddhism in I960, and additional courses in the modern history, sociol\u00ad ogy, and politics of East Asia were made available. An experiment with Korean language, history, and politics proved unsuccessful, but a project in Chinese linguistics, begun in 1960, en\u00ad riched the department's program, bringing a series of specialists to Princeton for conferences, research, and teaching. East Asian Studies has from the first focused upon undergraduate mastery of the modern colloquial languages as the EAST PYNE BUILDING 145 primary requirement for competence and understanding. Mote and Jansen worked with their colleagues at other universities in establishing Inter-Uni\u00ad versity Centers in Tokyo and Taipei in the early 1960s, and qualified under\u00ad graduates were encouraged (through support provided by the Class of 1944) to take an additional, undergraduate year of intensive language work in East Asia. Princeton-in-Asia (q.v.) added other opportunities. In 1963 the Critical Language Program brought undergraduates from other colleges to spend a \"junior year abroad in Princeton\" working on East Asian, Near Eastern, or Russian language. Young women in this program, promptly labeled \"critters\" by Prince\u00ad ton undergraduates, were the first un\u00ad dergraduate students to break the sex barrier on campus. In 1966 a summer school, initially in Chinese, after 1970 also in Japanese, was established at Middlebury College with Princeton di\u00ad rection and cooperation. By the 1970s, East Asian Studies had acquired a home in the old mathe\u00ad matics building, Fine Hall, now re\u00ad named Jones Hall (q.v.), and a full range of language, literature, history, and cognate courses, undergraduate as well as graduate, had brought the de\u00ad partment into the mainstream of campus\u2014and national\u2014attention. Marius B. Jansen East College, Princeton's first building used exclusively as a dormitory, was erected in 1833. It stood on the east side of Cannon Green, facing its identi\u00ad cal twin, West College (1836). With Nassau Hall on the north and Whig and Clio Halls on the south, East and West Colleges helped to form a quadrangle of pleasing symmetry. The razing of East Gollege in 1896 to make way for Pyne Library was called by some alumni \"the Crime of Ninety-Six.\" In its day East College was the un\u00ad dergraduate home of a number of emi\u00ad nent Princetonians. A notable group lived on the fourth and fifth floors of the south entry in the 1870s: Charles Scribner in '75, the two Butlers\u2014 Howard Russell and William Allen\u2014 and Bayard Henry in '76, Henry B. Thompson in '77, the two Pynes\u2014M. Taylor in '77 and Percy in '78\u2014and the two Dodges\u2014Cleveland and Earl in '79. These nine called themselves the South East Club and for many years after graduation met annually at dinner to talk about the University and its ad\u00ad vancement. They were especially in\u00ad terested in enlarging the campus, and their combined lifetime efforts secured for the University nearly a square mile of additional property. As individuals they gave five buildings and made large gifts to endowment. At one of their dinners they chipped in to endow a fel\u00ad lowship in the Graduate School and thus ensured a continuing remem\u00ad brance of their dormitory and their group: it is called the South East Club Fellowship in Social Science. East Pyne Building, originally Pyne Library, was built in 1897, the Ses- quicentennial gift of Mrs. Percy Rivington Pyne, mother of Moses Taylor Pyne 1877 (q.v.). Designed by William A. Potter (architect also of Chancellor Green Library and Alexan\u00ad der Hall) in collegiate Gothic, it was used with Chancellor Green as the Uni\u00ad versity Library until the completion of Firestone Library in 1948. Thereafter, as Pyne Administration Building, it housed various administrative offices 146 EATING CLUBS until 1965, when, with the completion of New South Building, it assumed its present name and was renovated to ac\u00ad commodate offices and classrooms of various language and literature de\u00ad partments and programs and also to form the southern part of the Chancel\u00ad lor Green Student Center. In niches just above the western arch at the foot of the tower are statues, by the Scottish-American sculptor, John Massey Rhind, of John Witherspoon and James McCosh, and, higher up, flanking the southwest corner, of James Madison 1771 and Oliver Ellsworth 1766 (qq.v.). On the south side of the tower is a sun dial and beneath it Martial's epi\u00ad gram about the hours it records: Pere- unt et Imputantur. (They pass away and are charged to our account.) The court in the center of East Pyne is dedicated to the memory of Henry B. Thompson 1877, for many years chair\u00ad man of the Trustees Committee on Grounds and Buildings, who as an un\u00ad dergraduate lived in East College (q.v.), which was razed to make way for Pyne Library. Eating clubs came into being in the nineteenth century as a consequence of the College's inability to provide adequate dining facilities for its grow\u00ad ing student population. With the ban\u00ad ning of Greek-letter fraternities (q.v.) in 1855, the field was left open for the eat\u00ad ing clubs to become the dominant so\u00ad cial influence among undergraduates. Although still a distinctive feature of Princeton's non-academic life, they are no longer the center of it, now that the University offers its larger and more diverse student body a wider variety of dining and social alternatives than ever before. (See Residential, Dining, and Social Facilities.) Originally, all undergraduates were required to take their meals in the commons operated by the college stew\u00ad ard; his offerings brought frequent complaints and occasional disorder. Beginning in 1843, students were sometimes permitted to board with families in town, where the rate was higher than that charged at commons. In certain cases, however, (the 1846 catalogue announced) \"select associa\u00ad tions\" of students had been formed whose expenses were even less than those in commons, and the arrange\u00ad ments thus made were \"perfectly satis\u00ad factory and by some preferred to every other.\" When the college refectory was per\u00ad manently closed in 1856, all students began taking their meals in village boardinghouses, many of them in \"select associations.\" In 1864, the newly founded Nassau Herald listed twelve such groups, by then called eat\u00ad ing clubs. These clubs grew in number\u2014there were twenty-five in 1876\u2014but they were temporary, last\u00ad ing four years at most, usually sporting playful names like \"Knights of the Round Table,\" \"Old Bourbon,\" \"At Mrs. Van Dyne's,\" and some others that the hungry students of earlier years would have appreciated\u2014 \"Hollow Inn,\" \"Nunquam of 1879 a group of up- perclassmen rented Ivy Hall on Mercer Street (originally the home of the Col\u00ad lege's short-lived law school), engaged their own steward, and began a more formal kind of eating club than any previously known. Four years later, this group obtained the College's per\u00ad mission to incorporate and to erect a simple frame house on Prospect Av\u00ad enue and thus became the first self- perpetuating upperclass eating club. Ivy was followed in 1886 by the Uni-EATING CLUBS 147 versity Cottage Club, which got its start in the \"University cottage\" on Univer\u00ad sity Place, and in the early 1890s by Tiger Inn, Cap and Gown, Colonial, Cannon, and Elm, which adopted common campus terms for their names. About a quarter of the juniors and seniors belonged to these seven clubs; the others continued to take their meals in casual groups in boardinghouses. \"We were barely conscious that there were such clubs,\" Andrew C. Imbrie, life-long secretary of 1895, later re\u00ad called, \"We could thumb our noses at them with complete self-respect.\" The early 1900s saw the formation of six more clubs\u2014Campus, Quadrangle, Charter, Tower, Terrace, Key and Seal\u2014and by 1906 two thirds of the upperclassmen were eating regularly on Prospect Avenue. The newer clubs were housed in modest frame build\u00ad ings, but the older ones now enjoyed handsome brick or stone clubhouses, some of them designed by architects of campus buildings. The influence the clubs were exert\u00ad ing on student social life was now markedly greater than it had been in the mid-nineties. President Wilson called the lot of the third left out of clubs \"a little less than deplorable.\" His particular concern was that the clubs separated the social from the intellec\u00ad tual interests of students, with the re\u00ad sult that the University was in danger of becoming for them \"only an artistic set\u00ad ting and background for life on Pros\u00ad pect Avenue.\" Wilson's alternative to the eating clubs was continued in the Quad Plan he proposed to the trustees in 1907 (see Residential, Dining and Social Facili\u00ad ties). Under its terms, the clubs would either have to be abolished, or, if their cooperation could be secured, devel\u00ad oped into smaller residential quads as part of the University itself. Though this plan was eventually rejected, the controversy it engendered helped stimulate some long-term changes in undergraduate social life. One change came immediately. In 1908, when commons for sophomores was estab\u00ad lished in University Hall, as it had been for freshmen in 1906, freshmen and sophomore eating clubs, sometimes called \"waiting clubs,\" were abolished by edict of the student Senior Council. Meanwhile, formation of new upper- class eating clubs continued but at a slower pace. Four more were begun in the years before the First World War: Dial Lodge, Arch Club, Cloister Inn, and Gateway. Arch Club was short\u00ad lived, disbanding with the onset of the war. Eight more new clubhouses re\u00ad placed frame-house \"incubators,\" Can- nor Club with a cannon before its main entrance, Dial Lodge, a sun-dial on its facade. Over the years, clubs tended to de\u00ad velop group personalities. In This Side of Paradise, Scott Fitzgerald '17 gave a description of some of them, which, though a caricature, offered a colorful impression of certain recognizable club traits: Ivy, detached and breathlessly aristocratic; Cottage, an impressive melange of brilliant adventurers and well-dressed philanderers; Tiger Inn, broad-shouldered and athletic, vitalized by an Quadrangle; and the dozen others varying in age and position. In January 1917\u2014around the time Fitzgerald was referring to\u2014five soph\u00ad omores issued a manifesto in the Princetonian, which declared that the club system operated against the best 148 EATING CLUBS interests of the University. Their rea\u00ad sons were much like those Wilson had advanced ten years earlier. The spokesman for the group was Richard F. Cleveland '19, whose father, ex- President Grover Cleveland, had, as a Princeton trustee, opposed the quad plan. Under the group's leadership, some ninety sophomores pledged themselves not to join the clubs but to continue to eat at commons in newly built Madison Hall (q.v.) during their upperclass years. The Cleveland Re\u00ad volt, as it came to be known, reached its climax during Bicker Week in March, but the reform it initiated was cut short the following month when Congress declared war on Germany, and normal college activities ceased for the duration of World War I. Two more clubs\u2014Court Club and Arbor Inn\u2014were formed following the war, bringing the proportion of up- perclassmen who were club members to 75 percent. During the Depression, Gateway and Arbor Inn became insolvent and were taken over by the University. Arbor Inn's building on Ivy Lane was used thereafter for a succession of aca\u00ad demic projects. Until World War II, Gateway was operated by the Univer\u00ad sity as a non-selective club with a fac\u00ad ulty member as master-in-residence. At the end of the war, the Gateway clubhouse on Washington Road was taken over by the enterprising new Prospect Club, which reduced costs by having all work, except cooking, done by its members. Founded in 1941, Prospect was obliged to disband in 1959 when it failed to attract enough mem\u00ad bers, owing, the Princetonian sug\u00ad gested, to greater interest in the new Woodrow Wilson Lodge, forerunner of Wilson College (q.v.). Criticism of the clubs and efforts at reform, which had continued at fre\u00adquent intervals following the Cleveland revolt, became more decisive in the fif\u00ad ties and sixties. In 1950 a declaration by over 500 sophomores that none would join a club unless all who desired mem\u00ad bership received invitations introduced an era of \"100 percent club member\u00ad ship\" that lasted well into the 1960s. In 1966 ten student leaders published a report declaring that the club election or \"bicker\" system imposed \"a false hierarchy on Princeton social life\" and erected \"artifical barriers among its students.\" They also asserted that be\u00ad cause of the lack of sufficient social al\u00ad ternatives, bicker was \"virtually com\u00ad pulsory.\" A year later fourteen up- perclassmen resigned from the Ivy Club in protest against the bicker sys\u00ad tem. In the late 1960s a special trustees' committee, under the chairmanship of S. Barksdale Penick '25, studied the club problem and related social ques\u00ad tions in company with representatives of the faculty, undergraduates, and alumni. It recommended the creation of a variety of dining and social alterna\u00ad tives in order to reduce the dispropor\u00ad tionate emphasis on membership in clubs that had developed over the years and to provide a better climate of living for all undergraduates. The ensuing years brought an in\u00ad crease in the number of alternative fa\u00ad cilities and a decrease in the number of independent clubs. When Key and Seal disbanded in 1968, its clubhouse and the adjoining building, which Court Club had given up four years earlier, were converted to a non-selective din\u00ad ing, social and academic gathering place called Stevenson Hall (q.v.). In 1970, the Princeton Inn College (q.v.) was created with purposes similar to those of Wilson College. Three more clubs discontinued oper\u00ad ations in the early 1970s and their DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS 149 buildings were used for other purposes\u2014Elm and Cannon as quar\u00ad ters for University research programs, Cloister Inn as a club open to all alumni\u2014but Cloister Inn was revived as an undergraduate eating club in 1977, and Elm Club, in 1978. In order to meet changing student interests and attitudes, many of the clubs adopted features somewhat simi\u00ad lar to those of the University's alterna\u00ad tive programs. A number developed additional opportunities for contact be\u00ad tween their members and faculty. Most admitted women; a few retained their traditional exclusiveness. Many be\u00ad came non-selective, granting admission on a first-come-first-served basis, and for those that remained selective the bicker procedure became more re\u00ad laxed, with sophomores calling on the clubs instead of waiting anxiously in their rooms for visits from club bicker committees. In 1978, thirteen of the original twenty private eating clubs were oper\u00ad ating as such. A little more than half the junior and senior classes were members. The complete list of clubs from the beginning follows: Ivy Club 1879 University Cottage Club 1886 Tiger Inn 1890 Cap and Gown Club 1890 Colonial Club 1891 Cannon Club 1895-1975 Elm Club 1895-1973, 1978- Campus Club 1900 Charter Club 1901 Quadrangle Club 1901 Tower Club 1902 Terrace Club 1904 Key and Seal Club 1904-1968 Dial Lodge 1907 Arch Club 1911-1917 Cloister Inn Club Club 1921-1964 Arbor Inn 1923-1939 Prospect Club 1941-1959 Economics, The Department of. The subject matter that came to be called \"political economy\" and still later \"eco\u00ad nomics\" developed only slowly as a dis\u00ad tinct field of study at Princeton. This was partly because of the late develop\u00ad ment and differentiation of \"the social sciences\" generally, and partly because of Princeton's devotion to her classical curriculum. Although, almost from the beginning in 1746, topics in political economy, along with those in many other fields, received attention in courses entitled \"moral philosophy,\" there was no specific course in political economy until 1819. In that year the College initiated a one-term course that all students were required to take along with seven other courses in various fields. This constituted Princeton's en\u00ad tire curriculum in economics until 1890, and it was taught by men whose primary responsibilities were in such diverse fields as belles lettres, natural philosophy, mathematics, and juris\u00ad prudence. The situation began to change in 1890, when Woodrow Wilson came to Princeton as Professor of Jurisprudence and Political Economy. Wilson moved the required senior course in political economy to junior year and introduced an \"advanced\" course, the History of Political Economy, as a senior elective. But Wilson's primary interests were in jurisprudence, law, and politics, and he was probably happy, therefore, to re\u00ad linquish his teaching in political econ\u00ad omy in 1892 to a newcomer, Winthrop More Daniels, who had been valedic\u00ad torian of the Class of 1888. Daniels was the first specialized economist on the 150 DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS faculty and for nearly twenty years was the leader in developing economics at Princeton, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Professor Wertenbaker has reported that Daniels \"caused a panic\" by announcing that \"economics would no longer be a snap,\" and only his able teaching and the growing in\u00ad terest in the subject permitted him to survive \"the consternation caused by this bold break with tradition.\" In 1904, when the faculty was divided into de\u00ad partments, Daniels became the first chairman of the new Department of History, Politics, and Economics. By the time he left Princeton in 1911 to ac\u00ad cept Wilson's appointment as chairman of the New Jersey Public Utility Com- niissfon, economics had grown mark\u00ad edly; there were now six faculty mem\u00ad bers, five undergraduate courses most of them extending over two terms, and some graduate seminars. Daniels was succeeded by Frank Albert Fetter, a distinguished economist who came from Cornell and was elected president of the American Economic Association in 1912. When economics was split off from history and politics to form a sepa\u00ad rate Department of Economics and So\u00ad cial Institutions in 1913, Fetter became its first chairman, and he was a key per\u00ad son in the growth of the department until his retirement in 1933. Economics at Princeton expanded rapidly in the years between the two world wars. By 1929, its faculty had grown to 22 members. Its undergradu\u00ad ate curriculum included 13 courses and a program for independent work, and in terms of undergraduate majors it was one of the largest departments in the University. Graduate study in econom\u00ad ics also rose markedly, although, con\u00ad sistent with University policy at that time, the number of graduate students was kept relatively small. Prior to 1920, the University had awarded only five doctoral degrees in economics; 37 were awarded in the next two decades. Two research sections were established dur\u00ad ing this period; the Industrial Rela\u00ad tions Section, headed first by Robert F. Foerster and then by J. Douglas Brown, who was later to become dean of the faculty; and the International Fi\u00ad nance Section, headed by Edwin Wal\u00ad ter Kemmerer. Several economists in the department achieved widespread recognition. Perhaps the best known were Fetter, who was widely esteemed as an economic theorist; Kemmerer, who achieved international repute as \"the money doctor\" (missions that he headed played leading roles in mone\u00ad tary reform in many foreign countries) and was president of the American Economic Association in 1926; and Frank Dunstan Graham, a recognized leader in the field of international eco\u00ad nomics. Since World War II the department has experienced numerous changes, some stemming from changes in the scope and content of economics, and some from developments within the University. Economics grew at an un\u00ad precedented rate during this period, reflecting the rapid accumulation of empirical materials, new analytical techniques, and new fields of study and research. Macroeconomics became a major field, reflecting theoretical de\u00ad velopments by Keynes and others as well as new national interest in the behavior of national income, employ\u00ad ment, and price levels. New courses in economic development resulted from the rise of international concern for the plight of the less developed countries. The genesis of urban economics was a response to the growing problems of our cities. Econometrics developed as a useful technique for testing and quan-JONATHAN EDWARDS 151 tifying economic theories, old and new; and mathematical economics emerged as a powerful technique of analysis. Vir\u00ad tually all branches of economics be\u00ad came more \"scientific\" in that they em\u00ad ployed more empirical materials and more precise methods of analysis. Developments within the University have also had strong impact on the size and role of the department. Under\u00ad graduate enrollments were swollen by the increased size of the student body and the continuing popularity of eco\u00ad nomics as a field of study. Most under\u00ad graduates took at least one course in economics\u2014many still remember such outstanding teachers as William G. Bowen and Burton G. Malkiel\u2014and a large number of them majored in the department. The expansion of the grad\u00ad uate school was accompanied by a com\u00ad mensurate increase in the number of graduate students in economics and expansion of the graduate curriculum. A heightened interest in economic re\u00ad search was reflected in both the growth of individual investigation and publica\u00ad tion, and the creation of four new or\u00ad ganizations: the Office of Population Research, headed first by Frank Note- stein and then by Ansley J. Coale; the Econometric Research Program, di\u00ad rected first by Oskar Morgenstern and later by Gregory Chow; the Research Program in Economic Development, conducted by W. Arthur Lewis and then by John P. Lewis; and the Center for Financial Research, led by Burton G. Malkiel. The creation of the graduate program in the Woodrow Wilson School in 1947 and its marked expansion after 1961 have engaged the efforts of many economists. Among those involved were Donald H. Wallace, who created the graduate program; Gardner Patter\u00ad son, who presided over its expansion; John P. Lewis, who served as dean of the school; and William G. Bowen and Richard A. Lester, who served as as\u00ad sociate deans. Many more economists are teachers in the program. By the end of World War II most of the faculty who had carried the work of the department in the prewar period had retired and had not been replaced. The department had not only to pro\u00ad vide for these replacements but also to make large net additions to its staff to meet its mounting responsibilities. To do this and also improve quality proved to be no easy task in an academic mar\u00ad ket in which able economists were scarce and in great demand. But some\u00ad how it was done. By the early 1970s the department had more than 40 members and was generally conceded to be well within the top seven or eight economics departments in the country. Only a few of the many members who contributed to this reputation can be mentioned here: Jacob Viner, one of the most ver\u00ad satile and eminent economists in the English-speaking world; W. Arthur Lewis, a leader in development eco\u00ad nomics; William J. Baumol, an out\u00ad standing J. Coale, demographer; Fritz Machlup, an expert in interna\u00ad tional economics and president of the American Economic Association in 1966; Oskar Morgenstern, best known for his work in game theory; and Richard A. Lester, Frederick H. Har\u00ad bison, and Albert Rees in labor and so\u00ad cial economics. In the long run, of course, the future of any department depends on the quality of its younger members. On this score the depart\u00ad ment has ample reasons for optimism. Lester V. Chandler Edwards, Jonathan (1703-1758), third president of Princeton for a brief period 152 EDWARDS HALL in 1758, was born in East Windsor, Connecticut, where his father was pastor. The only son in a family of eleven children, he entered Yale when he was not yet thirteen and graduated four years later at the head of his class. He studied theology, preached in a Presbyterian pulpit in New York, and in 1724 returned to Yale as tutor for two years, the second year as senior tutor and virtual head of the college, the rectorship then being vacant. In 1728 he succeeded his maternal grandfather as pastor at Northampton, Massachusetts, where his preaching brought remarkable religious revivals. But he alienated many of his congrega\u00ad tion in 1748 by his proposal to depart from his grandfather's policy of en\u00ad couraging all baptized persons to par\u00ad take of Communion and instead to admit to this sacrament only those who gave satisfactory evidence of being truly converted. He was dismissed in 1750. He moved to Stockbridge, Mas\u00ad sachusetts, then a frontier settlement, where he ministered to a tiny congrega\u00ad tion and served as missionary to the Housatonic Indians. There, having more time for study and writing, he completed his celebrated work, The Freedom of the Will. Edwards was elected president of Princeton September 29, 1757, five days after the death of his son-in-law, Aaron Burr, Sr., second president of the College. He was a popular choice, for he had been a friend of the College since its inception and was the most eminent American philosopher-theo\u00ad logian of his time. But Edwards shrank from taking on \"such a new and great business in the decline of life,\" feeling himself deficient in health, in temperament, and in some branches of learning. He finally yielded when a group of ministers persuaded him that it was his duty to accept. Late in Janu\u00ad ary 1758, he came to Princeton, where he preached in the College chapel and gave out questions in divinity to the senior class for each to study and write \"what he thought proper\" before com\u00ad ing together to discuss them\u2014an eight\u00ad eenth-century seminar. The seniors spoke enthusiastically of the \"light and instruction which Mr. Edwards com\u00ad municated.\" On March 22, 1758, he died of fever following inoculation for smallpox, and was buried in the President's Lot in the Princeton cemetery beside his son-in- law, Aaron Burr. Edwards had three sons and eight daughters. The three sons were graduated from Princeton; one of them, Jonathan Edwards, Jr. 1765, became president of Union College. Three daughters married Yale graduates; one was Burr; another was Timothy Dwight, forebear of three Yale presi\u00ad dents. In 1860 Edwards' great-grandsons had a copy made of Yale's eighteenth- century portrait of him and presented it to Princeton; it hangs in the Faculty Room in Nassau Hall. Edwards Hall commemorates the Col\u00ad lege's third president, Jonathan Ed\u00ad wards. It was built in 1880 at the behest of President McCosh to fill \"the clam\u00ad ant want\" of a \"new and plain dormitory cheap rooms for . . . strug\u00ad gling students,\" and to reduce the number of freshmen compelled \"to live beyond our walls and under no tutorial inspection.\" McCosh was sensitive to reports \"zealously propagated by the friends of rival institutions\" that Princeton was becoming a rich man's college and was not \"making provisions for a class of persons for whom the Col-ALBERT EINSTEIN 153 lege was originally instituted.\" He was also persuaded that the student dis\u00ad turbances that had brought the College unfavorable attention in the newspa\u00ad pers in the late 1870s \"were hatched in extra-collegiate rooms in town.\" In the 1880s and 1890s Edwards Hall had a reputation for \"plain living and high thinking\" and for a time was known as \"Poler's Paradise.\" Einstein, Albert (1879-1955) first vis\u00ad ited Princeton in 1921\u2014the year before he received the Nobel Prize\u2014to de\u00ad liver five Stafford Little lectures on the theory of relativity and to accept an honorary degree. He returned again in 1933 as a life member of the newly founded Institute for Advanced Study and lived here for the remaining twenty-two years of his life. Although his two-month visit to America in 1921 was made primarily to advance the cause of the Zionist move\u00ad ment, Einstein accepted Princeton's invitation to deliver the tour's most ex\u00ad tensive series of scientific lectures be\u00ad cause he felt more had been done here in relation to this theory of relativity than anywhere else in the United States. At ceremonies in Alexander Hall, President Hibben welcomed Einstein in German and conferred on him Princeton's honorary Doctor of Science, following the reading of a cita\u00ad tion by Dean Andrew Fleming West, who saluted him as \"the new Columbus of science, 'voyaging through strange seas of thought alone.' \" Scientists from all over the country packed McCosh 50 for all five lectures. Each lecture, which Einstein delivered in German, was followed with a resume in English by Princeton physicist Edwin P. Adams, who was, the Daily Princetonian noted, among the leading American expositors of the relativity theory, along with his Princeton col\u00ad leagues mathematician Luther P. Eisenhart and astrophysicist Henry Norris Russell. After being submitted to Einstein for revision and final ap\u00ad proval, a transcript of the lectures was translated into English by Professor Adams for publication by Princeton University Press, which gained the dis\u00ad tinction of being the first United States publisher to bring out a book by the world's most acclaimed living scientist. The Meaning of Relativity has been re\u00ad published in five editions and is still in print. After Einstein's acceptance of ap\u00ad pointment at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1933, the University enjoyed a renewal of its earlier association with him. All four of his colleagues in the In\u00ad stitute's School of Mathematics\u2014its first branch\u2014had previously been pro\u00ad fessors in the University, and until the Institute erected its first building in 1939, Einstein's office (Room 109) and theirs were located in the University's original Fine Hall, a building that con\u00ad tained several decorative tributes to Einstein's genius\u2014his relativity equa\u00ad tions among the motifs in the leaded windows and his famous remark, \"God is subtle, but he is not malicious,\" carved in the original German over the fireplace in the Common Room. When the Institute's FuId Hall was completed in 1939, Einstein took an office there on the ground floor, cus\u00ad tomarily walking the mile-and-a half between his white frame house at 112 Mercer Street and the Institute. He found his quiet life at Princeton \"inde\u00ad scribably enjoyable,\" and wrote his friend, the physicist Max Born, that he had \"settled down splendidly\"\u2014\"I hibernate like a bear in its cave, and really feel more at home than ever be\u00ad fore in all my varied existence.\" 154 LUTHER PFAHLER EISENHART His chief recreations in Princeton were playing the violin at musical eve\u00ad nings with friends, sailing in a little second-hand sailboat on Lake Carnegie, and walking in the countryside near the Institute. During the Princeton years, Einstein continued his studies in general relativ\u00ad ity, his critical discussion of the in\u00ad terpretation of quantum theory, and his work on a unified field theory, which was included in appendices to The Meaning of Rehtivity in its third, fourth, and fifth University Press edi\u00ad tions. At the same time, he played an increasingly prominent role on the world stage as an advocate of nuclear control and world peace. On the occasion of Einstein's seventieth birthday, some three hundred scientists gathered in Frick Chemical Laboratory for a symposium on his contributions to modern science, held under the joint auspices of the University and the Institute, whose di\u00ad rector, J. Robert Oppenheimer, ex\u00ad pressed the universal esteem in which Einstein was held by scientists the world over by referring to him in his opening remarks as \"the greatest member of our brotherhood.\" When Einstein died six years later in 1955, the Daily Princetonian devoted an entire issue to him, with tributes from friends and colleagues. Physics Department chairman Allen G. Shen- stone, who was Einstein's neighbor on Mercer Street, said his character was \"the most beautiful\" that he had ever known. Henry D. Smyth, chair\u00ad man of the University's Research Board and a former member of the Atomic Energy Commission, spoke of \"the in\u00ad formality and simplicity which charac\u00ad terized his relations with lesser scien\u00ad tists of all ages,\" and declared that Physics at Princeton had \"immeasura\u00ad bly benefited by his presence at the In\u00adstitute for Advanced Study.\" A statement from the Institute voiced the feeling colleagues there \"shared with all the world\" that \"one of the great figures of mankind's struggle for intellectual insight and moral im\u00ad provement\" had passed \"into the indel\u00ad ible record of history where his lofty place has long been assured.\" In the years since his death, Ein\u00ad stein's association with Princeton has been commemorated in a number of ways. A new United States postage stamp bearing a Philippe Halsman pho\u00ad tograph of him was issued in Princeton under the sponsorship of the University and the Institute in 1966, on the eighty-seventh anniversary of his birth. Nine years later, a University profes\u00ad sorship was endowed in his name with a $1 million grant from the Inter\u00ad national Business Machines Corpora\u00ad tion, and Robert H. Dicke, a former physics department chairman known for his studies in the field of gravity and for important experimental tests of Einstein's general theory of relativity, was named first Albert Einstein Profes\u00ad sor of Science. In the mid-seventies, plans were going forward for publica\u00ad tion of Einstein's papers by Princeton University Press in a series expected to run more than twenty volumes\u2014a project the New York Times called \"one of the more ambitious publishing ven\u00ad tures of Eisenhart, Luther Princeton's develop\u00ad ment in many ways: as mathematician, teacher, chairman of his department; as chairman of the Committee on Scien\u00ad tific Research, dean of the faculty, dean of the Graduate School; and as father of the four-course plan. Born in York, Pennsylvania, Eisen-LUTHER PFAHLER EISENHART 155 hart was graduated in 1896 from Gettys\u00ad burg College where he excelled in base\u00ad ball and mathematics. He completed all of the mathematics courses the college gave by the end of his sophomore year and spent his last two years studying mathematical problems on his own under the general guidance of his pro\u00ad fessor. This experience, he said later, gave him the idea for the four-course plan. He went on to graduate study at the Johns Hopkins University, where he found the emphasis on study and re\u00ad search and the low priority given to rules and restrictions congenial and stimulating. After receiving his Ph.D. in 1900, Eisenhart was called to Princeton by President Patton as instructor in math\u00ad ematics. He soon earned a reputation as a stimulating teacher and in 1905 was selected by Woodrow Wilson to be one of the original preceptors. He also made his mark as one of the elite group of promising young mathematicians brought together and nurtured by Dean Fine, and rose to the rank of full professor in 1909 when he was only thirty-three. In 1925, following Eisenhart's work on the early development of the four- course plan, President Hibben chose him as dean of the faculty. Four years later, after Dean Fine's death, Eisen\u00ad hart was also appointed chairman of the Committee on Scientific Research, named Dod Professor of Mathematics, and made chairman of the department. Eisenhart's continuation of the work begun by Fine brought Princeton to a preeminent place among the world's centers for mathematical study and prepared the way for the outstanding scientific contribution the University was able to make to the national effort in World War II. In the interregnum between the Hibben and Dodds presi\u00ad dencies, Eisenhart bore a major share of administrative responsibility. In 1933 President Dodds named him dean of the Graduate School. Eisenhart's world renown as a crea\u00ad tive mathematician, as summed up by his former student and colleague, Pro\u00ad fessor Albert W. Tucker, \"stemmed from his fundamental publications in differential geometry and tensor analysis\u2014an area spotlighted in the 1920s by Einstein's general theory of relativity. His greatest work was prob\u00ad ably his Riemannian Geometry (Prince\u00ad ton University Press, 1926). After re\u00ad tirement he continued to publish with undiminished zest. His bibliography spans a period of over sixty years, dur\u00ad ing which time vast changes occurred in the area of mathematics in which he worked. Some of these changes he ini\u00ad tiated, some he accepted, and some he ignored\u2014but always he pushed stead\u00ad ily forward, consistently loyal to this chosen area of research.\" As a teacher, Eisenhart was a skilled practitioner of his own dictum that \"teaching methods . . . must be de\u00ad signed to encourage independence and self-reliance, to evoke curiosity, and stimulate the imagination and creative inpulse.\" His students recall that some\u00ad times he would have to ask many ques\u00ad tions before the student at the blackboard finally got the point, but then Eisenhart's \"That's it! That's the way to do it!\" always made the student feel that he himself had made the dis\u00ad covery. THE FOUR-COURSE PLAN Eisenhart's opportunity to introduce the four-course plan came in the early 1920s when President Hibben ap\u00ad pointed a subcommittee of the Course of Study Committee to consider the question of reinstating honors courses, which had been discontinued during World War I. These honors courses, 156 LUTHER PFAHLER EISENHART begun soon after the adoption of the preceptorial method in 1905, had never attracted many students, and the en\u00ad rollment had been steadily dropping in the years before the war. Eisenhart persuaded the committee and then President Hibben, who in turn per\u00ad suaded the faculty, to adopt a radical and more ambitious plan that \"sought to elevate the plane of endeavor and at\u00ad tainment of the whole undergraduate body rather than to provide honors courses for a comparatively few stu\u00ad dents.\" Under the new plan, every upper- class candidate for the A. B. would take four courses, instead of five as formerly, two of which would be in his field of concentration or department. In the free time made available to him by the reduction of the course load, the stu\u00ad dent would engage in independent study and, in his senior year, write a thesis on a subject of his own choosing. At the end of the senior year, he would take a written comprehensive examina\u00ad tion on selected topics in his field of concentration. Honors would be awarded on the basis of this examina\u00ad tion and the thesis combined. Eisenhart's four-course plan was re\u00ad markable both for the emphasis it placed on independent study and for its support of the principle that honors at graduation should be open to all stu\u00ad dents and not just to a restricted group. This later provision was the most con\u00ad troversial feature of the plan. It was also the one in which Eisenhart believed most strongly. He insisted that grades made in underclass years did not con\u00ad stitute a reliable test of a student's abil\u00ad ity to qualify for honors, and that, on the contrary, the capacity for intellec\u00ad tual achievement frequently did not become evident until a student had been allowed to function freely on his own in his chosen area of concentra\u00adtion. Eisenhart would cite with relish the instances of students who, after re\u00ad ceiving mediocre grades in underclass years, found their interest aroused by independent work in upperclass years and had gone on to graduate with hon\u00ad ors. At the same time, he held that it was not essential to win honors in order to derive benefit from the four-course plan. \"The real test of an educational process,\" he said, \"is what is becoming of the student as he proceeds with his education\u2014how he is being prepared to continue his education and become an educated man.\" Eisenhart had to contend with apathy and some opposition in the early days of the four-course plan. Many fac\u00ad ulty members lacked enthusiasm for the new plan; it required more time and effort on their part, and some thought Eisenhart too optimistic about the level of work that could be expected of undergraduates. President Hibben, however, backed the plan whole\u00ad heartedly and threw the full weight of his influence into persuading the fac\u00ad ulty to give it a fair trial. A number of the undergraduates felt that the plan was too specialized and even more thought it too hard. The spring after the plan became effective with the Class of 1925 at the beginning of their junior year, the Class of 1924 signified their luck in escaping the \"misfortune\" by wearing horseshoes on their beer jackets; the next year the Class of 1925 jacket showed a tiger crushed under four massive tomes. And when, in 1927, the seniors sang about Eisenhart on the steps of Nassau Hall, it was mostly in fun but a trifle in earnest: Luther Pfahler Eisenhart, Efficient from the very start; But he's condemned in the eyes of man For originating the four-course pfon. LUTHER PFAHLER EISENHART 157 Skeptical alumni questioned whether the plan was appropriate for under\u00ad graduates. A number of them reported that the impression had been circulated among schoolboys that the four-course plan was burdensome, that it left un\u00ad dergraduates insufficient time for the usual college activities, that while it might benefit those who wished to de\u00ad vote their lives to academic pursuits, it was not suitable for others. These re\u00ad ports, coming as they did during a low period in Princeton's football fortunes, were accompanied by the further suggestion that schoolboys who were good at games were tending to look to other colleges. These discussions came to a head in the fall of 1930 and resulted in the Alumni Council's appointment of a committee to study the matter. Eisenhart proposed that alumni who had had experience with the plan be asked their opinion of its value. A letter sent to graduates from 1925 through 1930 brought back a favorable response and concrete evidence from men in many different occupations that the plan was accomplishing what Eisenhart had promised it would. In support of his cherished belief in the stimulating effect of independent study, Eisenhart marshalled impressive figures: of the 1016 men in the Classes of 1925 through 1930 who had won honors at graduation, 17 had been fifth groupers as sophomores, 167 fourth groupers, 407 third groupers. His answer to the charge that the four-course plan was making study at Princeton too difficult, was that the percentage of under\u00ad graduates dropped for scholastic rea\u00ad sons in 1929-1930 was the lowest it had been in twenty-five years. The Alumni Council eventually turned in a favorable report on the four-course plan. In the natural course of events Princeton's football fortunes improved, and reports of schoolboy fears were no longer heard. In his later years Eisenhart had the satisfaction of knowing not only that the four-course plan had won general acceptance but that most Princetonians had come to regard the senior thesis, the capstone of independent study, as the most valu\u00ad able element in their undergraduate education. * In accomplishing all that he did, Eisenhart made effective use of his time\u2014even the briefest moments. More important, he appeared never to waste energy giving vent to anger or frustration. He viewed human foibles with dry humor but without sarcasm, never indulging in arguments ad hominem; ideas were what concerned him. He was always receptive to ques\u00ad tions and criticisms; and whether they came from faculty colleague or trustee, freshman or alumnus, Eisenhart would hear his critic out and then try to bring him around to his point of view, usually ending the demonstration of his propo\u00ad sition with a wrinkled smile and a \"Isn't that it? Isn't that it?\" Eisenhart served as president of the American Mathematical Society and of the American Association of Colleges, and as vice president of the National Academy of Sciences and of the Ameri\u00ad can Association for the Advancement of Science. He became the executive officer of the American Philosophical Society in 1942 and continued to supervise its affairs long after his re\u00ad tirement from Princeton in 1945, com\u00ad muting to Philadelphia once or twice a week through his eighty-fourth year. At his death, his faculty colleagues said that \"in two centuries of Prince\u00ad ton's history few scholars had done more to shape the future of the Univer\u00ad sity,\" and the trustees declared that he had \"earned an enduring place in the 158 DEPARTMENT OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING front rank\" of those who had \"made Princeton great.\" A portrait of Dean Eisenhart hangs in Procter Hall of the Graduate College. The Eisenhart Arch, given in his honor by an anonymous donor in 1951, marks the western approach to the Graduate College from Springdale Road. * The Eisenhart ideal of independent study re\u00ad ceived additional emphasis beginning in 1967; thereafter, each undergraduate working for the A.B, was required to take only four courses a term during freshman and sophomore as well as junior year and three during senior year. Electrical Engineering, Department of. Originally, engineering was as\u00ad sociated primarily with the construc\u00ad tion of military fortifications and de\u00ad vices. Early in the nineteenth century the application of this rapidly develop\u00ad ing body of knowledge for nonmilitary purposes was designated civil engineer\u00ad ing. Thereafter, civil engineering en\u00ad compassed all engineering practice until the late nineteenth century, when increasing knowledge and technological innovation led to specialization and di\u00ad vision into various subfields. Electrical engineering was often the first specialty so identified in universities because of the great activity in electrical research, development, and invention of the 1870s. The stage was set at Princeton when Cyrus Fogg Rrackett (q.v.) arrived in 1873 as Professor of Physics. This re\u00ad markable, energetic man was most in\u00ad terested in electrical phenomena and their applications. He was a friend of Thomas Edison and often supplied the theoretical basis for the inventor's amazing practical intuition and insight. Brackett's interest led naturally to the establishment of a two-year graduate program, leading to the degree of Elec\u00adtrical Engineer, first announced in the 1889 Catalogue of the College of New Jersey. Although the engineering sub\u00ad jects have changed substantially since that time, the prerequisite education has remained much the same. In par\u00ad ticular, the statement in the 1889 cata\u00ad logue that \"Mathematics will be treated as a working instrument of which the student has already acquired control . . .\" is consistent with the continuing emphasis on applied mathematics in Electrical Engineering. Brackett's role in the establishment of Electrical En\u00ad gineering at Princeton was recognized when the wing housing this department in the Engineering Quadrangle was named Brackett Hall. Brackett's successor was Malcolm MacLaren, a practicing electrical en\u00ad gineer from Westinghouse who served as chairman throughout a period of educational change. The technological demands of World War I accentuated the need for engineering education, and special intensive programs were es\u00ad tablished in the University. This activ\u00ad ity further increased the growing inter\u00ad est in undergraduate curricula, and when the School of Engineering was es\u00ad tablished in 1921, Electrical Engineer\u00ad ing was one of five departments offering the Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree for undergraduate specialization in their fields. MacLaren retired in 1937 and was succeeded by Clodius H. Willis (q.v.), an expert in power conversion who, during World War II, also faced the pressure of demands for increased en\u00ad gineering education. This time, the de\u00ad velopment of sophisticated electronic devices placed a relatively greater bur\u00ad den on electrical engineering educa\u00ad tors, who were called on to produce graduates capable of dealing with such devices as sonar and radar. In addition OLIVER ELLSWORTH 159 to managing army- and navy-supported undergraduate programs, Willis di\u00ad rected a graduate radar training pro\u00ad gram. During this era, the department became expert at making necessary adaptations; the graduate radar pro\u00ad gram, for example, used a garage oppo\u00ad site the University Press as its principal laboratory. In 1950, Willis resigned the chair\u00ad manship because of failing health, and Walter C. Johnson replaced him. This was again a period when educational adaptation was needed to accommodate the new directions and changing em\u00ad phasis that had arisen from the technological developments of the war. In recognition of the growing impor\u00ad tance of research requiring advanced mathematics and physics in addition to a high degree of engineering specializa\u00ad tion, the Ph.D. program had been in\u00ad troduced in 1946. During Johnson's chairmanship, doctoral education and the accompanying faculty and student research became an increasingly impor\u00ad tant departmental activity. In 1966 Mac Elwyn Van Valkenburg, a nationally know circuit theorist, came from the University of Illinois to as\u00ad sume the chairmanship. Under his di\u00ad rection, research and graduate educa\u00ad tion were further strengthened, and the undergraduate curriculum was re\u00ad vised to reflect the changing directions in the field. Van Valkenburg returned to the Uni\u00ad versity of Illinois in 1973, and Bruce W. Arden was called from the University of Michigan to become chairman. Arden's principal interests are in the area of computer science and engineering. The development of the electronic digital computer has had a marked impact on society in many ways; at the same time, it has profoundly changed many of the classical engineering problem-solving techniques. Consequently, undergrad\u00ad uate and graduate students are deeply interested in computing, and they are being educated to understand and use this powerful tool in engineering work. In the tradition of engineering at Princeton the Department of Electrical Engineering continues to provide a strong scientific education adapted to current methods and problems. Bruce W. Arden Ellsworth, Oliver (1745-1807), one of the nation's founding fathers and third Chief Justice of the United States, re\u00ad ceived half of his undergraduate educa\u00ad tion at Yale, and half at Princeton, where he graduated in 1766. In his junior year he and others founded the Well Meaning Club, which later be\u00ad came the Cliosophic Society. Returning to his home in Windsor, Connecticut, he studied theology and then law, and was admitted to the bar in 1771. At first his law practice was so unremunerative that he had to sup\u00ad port himself by farming and occasional woodchopping, and on days when the court was sitting he was obliged to walk from his farm in Hartford and back, a round trip of twenty miles, since he was too poor to keep a horse. In 1775 he moved to Hartford. There his rise at the bar was rapid, and before long there were few important cases in Connecticut in which Ellsworth did not represent one side or the other. He was a delegate to the General As\u00ad sembly of the state that met soon after the Battle of Lexington, and through\u00ad out the Revolutionary War was a member of the Continental Congress. He was one of the delegates from Con\u00ad necticut in the Federal Constitutional Convention, one of the first two 160 ENDOWED PROFESSORSHIPS senators from Connecticut, and, on ap\u00ad pointment of President Washington, served as Chief Justice of the United States from 1796 to 1800. At the Federal Constitutional Con\u00ad vention, William Pierce, a delegate from Georgia who kept careful notes about all his colleagues, said Ellsworth was \"a gentleman of a clear, deep, and copious understanding, eloquent in . . . public debate . . . very happy in reply, and choice in selecting such parts of his adversary's arguments as he finds makes the strongest impressions, in order to take off the force of them so as to admit the power of his own.\" Ellsworth employed these talents to support the Connecticut Compromise, which broke the deadlock between the large states, represented by James Madison 1771 of Virginia, and the small states, represented by Ellsworth's fel\u00ad low Well Meaner and Cliosophian, Wil\u00ad liam Paterson of New Jersey. Ellsworth made his greatest contribu\u00ad tion while serving in the United States Senate by drafting the Judiciary Act of 1789; the court system it established has continued to the present with little change. Yale conferred an honorary LL. D. on him in 1790; Princeton, in 1797. Endowed Professorships first came into being at Princeton in the middle of the last century. In 1827 the newly formed Alumni Association of Nassau Hall stressed the importance of collect\u00ad ing funds for the endowment of profes\u00ad sorships, but it was not until 1857 that Silas Holmes of New York City gave Princeton's first endowed chair\u2014in \"belles-lettres\"\u2014which was named for him. Others soon followed: in 1864 John I. Blair gave a professorship in geology that bears his name; in 1869 Samuel Bayard Dod 1857 gave one in mathematics in memory of his father, Professor Albert Baldwin Dod; in 1870 John N. Woodhull 1828, a local physi\u00ad cian, founded a chair in modern lan\u00ad guages; and in 1872 John C. Green gave a physics professorship in honor of Professor Joseph Henry. With the growing prosperity of the country, gifts for new chairs increased steadily and by 1900 there were six\u00ad teen. Thereafter, the number increased more rapidly: by the end of President Hibben's administration in 1932 there were thirty-five; by the end of Presi\u00ad dent Dodds' in 1957, sixty-five; when President Goheen left office in 1972 there were eighty-seven. By 1976, there were ninety-eight professorships supported by special funds\u2014ninety endowed by gifts or bequests, five sup\u00ad ported by the Higgins Trust (estab\u00ad lished in 1950), and three by current grants. Named for professors, trustees, alumni classes, individual alumni, and other friends of the University, they were fairly evenly distributed among the several areas of learning. About a third of the University's full professors occupy these specially designated chairs. Endowment. On March 25, 1745, ten men executed pledges totaling 185 pounds \"for the purpose of Erecting a Collegiate School in the province of New Jersey for the instructing of youth in the Learned Languages, Liberal Arts, and Sciences.\" The pledges were made a year and a half before the first charter establishing the College of New Jersey was granted. The document provided that only the interest earned on the principal sum could be ex\u00ad pended for current purposes: namely, the payment of the president's salary and the salaries of tutors, and that the ENDOWMENT 161 principal was to be continuously rein\u00ad vested to generate income for the fu\u00ad ture. These modest pledges\u2014whose value proved to be less than the presi\u00ad dent's annual salary\u2014marked the be\u00ad ginning of Princeton's endowment, funds that in the mid-seventies totaled over $450 million. The classic definition of \"endow\u00ad ment\" is a gift made on the stipulation that the principal be maintained in perpetuity and that only income from investment of the gift be expended. In addition to gifts of this nature, the Uni\u00ad versity's current endowment fund also includes gifts received without any such stipulation, and allocated by the trustees to function as endowment, as well as appreciation earned from the investment of endowment funds. In absolute terms the Princeton en\u00ad dowment is one of the largest of any University in the country. Measured in terms of the size of the fund relative to the size of the University\u2014for instance, by an approximate measure such as en\u00ad dowment dollar per student\u2014Prince\u00ad ton's endowment ranks as probably greater than that of any university but Harvard. The income generated an\u00ad nually from the endowment now consti\u00ad tutes about 16 percent of the Universi\u00ad ty's annual operating budget. The endowment thus represents the legacy to the present of the past generosity of the University's sup\u00ad porters. The growth of the endowment also reflects the skill and insight of the trustees in managing Princeton's funds. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, when conventional wisdom indicated that an endowment fund should be invested largely in fixed-income securities, Princeton increasingly allocated its en\u00ad dowment to equities, with a strong em\u00ad phasis on growth-type stocks. Such in\u00ad vestments have tended to produce higher rates of return than so-called in\u00ad come stocks or bonds. In 1940 only 27 percent of the market value of our en\u00ad dowment was invested in common stocks; today about 75 percent of the fund is in equities. This investment strategy has yielded superior results. For instance, from 1958 through 1975, Princeton's en\u00ad dowment earned more in capital ap\u00ad preciation and income than the stock market on average, a performance achieved by few institutional funds, col\u00ad lege, corporate, or financial. A study by the National Association of College and University Business Officers shows that over a ten-year period ending June 30, 1975, Princeton's endowment perform\u00ad ance ranked fourth out of eighty en\u00ad dowment funds examined. Policy for management of the Uni\u00ad versity's endowment is set by an In\u00ad vestment Committee of three trustees who constitute a subcommittee of the Finance Committee of the Board of Trustees. The University's chief fi\u00ad nancial officer sits with the Investment Committee. For many years, the In\u00ad vestment Committee approved in ad\u00ad vance the purchase and sale of all secu\u00ad rities, aided by John W. Bristol & Co. Inc., which served as investment ad\u00ad viser to the Committee\u2014a role that firm (and a predecessor organization) played since the mid-1930s. In the fall of 1977, the Investment Committee adopted a new procedure by which the committee concentrated on policy, delegating responsibility for the day- to-day selection of securities for the University's portfolio to four invest\u00ad ment advisers: John W. Bristol and Herbert E. Gernert of New York, Robert E. Pruyne of Boston, and Mitchell Milias of Los Angeles. Paul B. Firstenberg 162 SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND APPLIED SCIENCE Engineering and Applied Science, The School of, owes its origin to the ben\u00ad efactions of John C. Green (q.v.), founder in 1872 of the School of Sci\u00ad ence, and to the pioneering efforts of two early professors in that school, Cyrus Fogg Brackett and Charles McMillan (qq.v.). McMillian, who was called in 1875 to fill a civil engineering chair endowed that year by Green, gave the College's first engineering course and organized its first engi\u00ad neering department. Brackett, who came in 1873 to fill a physics chair en\u00ad dowed that year by Green, gave new life to the teaching of physics and con\u00ad ducted the College's first graduate course in engineering\u2014in the School of Electrical Engineering, which he began in 1889. The civil engineers turned out by McMillan and the electrical engineers by Brackett were at first few in number, but by 1912 there were enough of them to organize the Princeton Engineering Association \"to bring together the men of Princeton in\u00ad terested in engineering . . . to the single end that the interests, influence, and efficiency of Princeton University be advanced through its Department of Engineering.\" Enthusiastic about the professional training Princeton had given them, they were eager to have the University broaden its curriculum to include other branches of engineering. Spurred on by this association, the University announced the formation of a School of Engineering in 1921, and in 1922 Arthur M. Greene, Jr. (q.v.) came from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as its first dean. Greene proved to be, in the words of his successor, Kenneth H. Condit, \"a born teacher, an able administrator, and a dynamo of en\u00ad ergy.\" Under Greene's guidance, four-year undergraduate programs were offered in civil, chemical, electrical, mechani\u00ad cal, and mining (later geological) en\u00ad gineering, and one-year graduate courses leading to the corresponding engineering degree (later to the Master of Science in Engineering for all fields). In 1928 the school was given a home of its own, named the John C. Green Engineering Building (now Green Hall), the old Green School of Science having been destroyed by fire shortly before. With the help of the Princeton En\u00ad gineering Association, advisory com\u00ad mittees of practicing engineers were formed for all engineering departments in 1935. These groups set the pattern for the system of Advisory Councils for all departments of the University estab\u00ad lished in 1941. Out of their discussions evolved the Basic Engineering Pro\u00ad gram, which the faculty formulated in 1938. Greene's devotion and energy gave the school a sure foundation. When he came to Princeton in 1922 there were 84 engineering students. By 1940, when he retired, the number had grown to 379. But perhaps his most important contribution was the staunch support he gave to the Princeton concept of en\u00ad gineering education, the combining of instruction in science and fundamental engineering subjects with courses in the liberal arts, to provide what Presi\u00ad dent Hibben and he liked to call \"En\u00ad gineering Plus.\" 1940-1954 Kenneth H. Condit, who succeeded Dean Greene, was a graduate of Ste\u00ad vens Institute in mechanical engineer\u00ad ing and of Princeton in civil engineer\u00ad ing. He had been an editor of McGraw-Hill engineering journals and, for a time, executive assistant to the SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND APPLIED SCIENCE 163 president of the National Industrial Conference Board. He had also been president of the Princeton Engineering Association. Condit's deanship covered the dif\u00ad ficult days of World War II and the immediate postwar period. A rapid de\u00ad velopment of government research plus a greatly expanded program of instruc\u00ad tion for civilian and military engineers during the war was followed, in Presi\u00ad dent Dodds' words, \"by a broadening of all areas of teaching and research far beyond dimensions previously envis\u00ad aged.\" A new Department of Aeronautical Engineering, initiated by Daniel C. Sayre (q.v.) early in the war, became, in a very few years, a leader in its field. A pioneering interdisciplinary program in plastics was also begun; it later evolved into the Polymer Sciences and Materials Program. The undergraduate curriculum was enriched by the intro\u00ad duction of special programs which permitted students with special abili\u00ad ties to do work in two fields of engineer\u00ad ing or to combine their study of one en\u00ad gineering field with additional concen\u00ad tration in a related field of science and mathematics. Two undergraduates founded The Princeton Engineer (q.v.), which faithfully mirrored the growth of the school in succeeding years. Graduate training, previously limited to the one year required for the M. S. E. degree, was gradually extended to in\u00ad clude work for the doctorate: Ph.D. programs were introduced in chemical engineering and electrical engineering in 1946, in aeronautical engineering in 1949, in civil engineering in 1951, in mechanical engineering in 1952. The growth of the school put a heavy burden on the Green Engineering Building, which had been designed to accommodate 400 undergraduates. Chemical Engineering fell heir to the old chemical laboratory building next door; Aeronautical Engineering, to several buildings near the lake which had been built for the Physics Depart\u00ad ment during the war; and, with the help of the ever-loyal Princeton En\u00ad gineering Association, funds were raised to build the Hayes wing on Green for mechanical engineering. The acquisition, in 1951, of the prop\u00ad erty of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research and its development as the James Forrestal Campus (q.v.), under Professor Sayre's guidance as di\u00ad rector and Dean Condit's as chairman of the administrative committee, pro\u00ad vided excellent working space for the burgeoning Department of Aeronauti\u00ad cal Engineering. When Dean Condit retired in 1954, the engineering faculty was three times as large as when he took office; the number of undergraduates had in\u00ad creased from 379 to 528, the number of graduate students from 11 to 87. 1954-1971 Joseph Clifton Elgin, third dean of the school, brought to the office in 1954 twenty-five years' experience as the University's first teacher of chemical engineering, including eighteen as the first chairman of that department. Outstanding among the school's achievements during his administration was the development of a new concept of engineering education, which left much of the traditional engineering art\u2014the technology and the skills\u2014to a period of apprenticeship in industry, and placed increasing emphasis on en\u00ad gineering science, which, in Elgin's words, is concerned with \"the princi\u00ad ples upon which all technologies and engineering skills are ultimately based.\" 164 SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND APPLIED SCIENCE The Departments of Chemical and Electrical Engineering had for some years emphasized the engineering sci\u00ad ence approach and this was now ex\u00ad tended to the other departments. Un\u00ad dergraduate curricula were complete\u00ad ly revised and graduate programs strengthened in response to Elgin's urging: With strong departments of math\u00ad ematics and the natural sciences [he wrote], Princeton has an exceptional opportunity to bring its School of Engineering to the forefront in its contributions to graduate engineer\u00ad ing education and the advancement of knowledge in the engineering sci\u00ad ences. The faculty's efforts to this end were rewarded in 1962 when Princeton was one of five universities to receive grants of one million dollars each from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in recogni\u00ad tion of the emphasis they had given the scientific approach to engineering edu\u00ad cation, which the Foundation sought to encourage nationally. With these developments, the space shortage which the school had suffered increasingly since World War II made new quarters one of the most urgent needs to be met by the $53 Million Campaign. Canvassers sought $8 mil\u00ad lion for a new quadrangle for engineer\u00ad ing science, and when that amount had been raised, Dean Elgin and his faculty were ready with plans for a center that would provide facilities for new patterns of instruction and for expanded pro\u00ad grams of postgraduate education and engineering research. In the fall of 1962, the school moved into the new Engineering Quadrangle, whose five connecting halls gave it four times the space it had had in the Green Engineering Building and its satellites, and whose library's book capacity was seven times that of its former library. At the same time, the increasing em\u00ad phasis the faculty had given to en\u00ad gineering science was recognized by changing the school's name to the School of Engineering and Applied Sci\u00ad ence. Changing orientations also brought a merger of Aeronautical En\u00ad gineering and Mechanical Engineering to form the Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Sciences, and a change in the organization of Geological En\u00ad gineering, which merged with Civil Engineering in 1966 and subsequently became a program in that department, offered in cooperation with the De\u00ad partment of Geological and Geophysi\u00ad cal Sciences. Having acquired more adequate space and equipment the school pros\u00ad pered through the 1960s. Interdiscipli\u00ad nary research and instruction were fos\u00ad tered by the initiation of programs jointly offered by several engineering departments, sometimes in cooperation with non-engineering departments, in such fields as solid state and materials sciences, water resources, geophysical fluid dynamics, environmental studies. In 1969 Elgin's leadership was recog\u00ad nized by the American Society for En\u00ad gineering Education when it conferred on him its highest honor, the Lamme Award. Elgin retired as dean in 1971. During the seventeen years of his administra\u00ad tion the faculty almost doubled to ninety-seven, the annual volume of sponsored research more than tripled to $3.8 million, the number of graduate students almost tripled to 241, with the number of undergraduate students re\u00ad maining about the same. But the most dramatic index of the school's growth was the increase in the number of en\u00ad gineering Ph. D. s awarded in one aca-SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND APPLIED SCIENCE 165 demic year: from seven in 1953-1954 to fifty in 1970-1971. THE 1970s Robert G. Jahn, Elgin's successor as fourth dean of the school, did both his undergraduate and graduate work at Princeton. He won highest honors in mechanical engineering at graduation in 1951 and was joint winner of the an\u00ad nual Kusaka prize as the most promis\u00ad ing student of physics when he took his Ph.D. in that subject in 1955. After teaching for seven years at Lehigh and California Institute of Technology, he returned to Princeton in 1962 as assist\u00ad ant professor of aeronautical engineer\u00ad ing in the Guggenheim Laboratories for the Aerospace Propulsion Sciences, and in 1967 he became professor of aerospace sciences. In 1968 he pub\u00ad lished Physics of Electric Propulsion, the definitive text in its field; the fol\u00ad lowing year he received the Curtis W. McGraw [9] Award of the American Society of Engineering Education for his research in plasma propulsion. In an interview reported in Univer\u00ad sity soon after he took office in 1971, Dean Jahn outlined the distinctive role of the Princeton School of Engineering in this way: Princeton is a very special place in terms of excellence of the overall academic program, size, heritage. We cannot pretend that we are a major technological institute like M.LT. or CaI. Tech. Nor can we replicate a large university complex, like Michigan or Minnesota. We have a small engineering school which must flourish in the framework of a small, liberal, excellent univer\u00ad sity. That I regard as an advantage, especially in an era which favors in\u00ad dividually tailored, liberal engineer\u00ading education for its students. We must respond to the anti-techno\u00ad logical criticism being heard today; more important, we must respond to the needs of society for solutions to some very pressing problems. What better place to do it than at a univer\u00ad sity which has well-developed pro\u00ad grams in the humanities, social sci\u00ad ences, and natural sciences; and which has a heritage of engineering education that has always em\u00ad phasized the development of the mind of the student more than the simple transfer of technical facts and techniques? \"Solutions to . . . pressing problems\" were sought in a series of four interdis\u00ad ciplinary topical programs introduced in 1972 as added study opportunities for undergraduates: Bioengineering, Energy Conversion and Resources, Environmental Studies, and Transpor\u00ad tation. The purpose of these topical programs was to demonstrate the rele\u00ad vance of fundamental engineering scholarship to urgent contemporary so\u00ad cial problems. This new curricular di\u00ad mension proved attractive to the stu\u00ad dents, and helped to reverse the anti- technology mood that prevailed in the early seventies. Enrollment in the freshman class, which had dropped to 135 in the fall of 1971, increased sharply to 185 in 1972, and reached an all-time high of 250 in 1976. The same period also saw the first significant en\u00ad rollment of women in the school; in 1973 they constitued 11 percent of the entering class, and by 1977 nearly 18 percent of the University's under\u00ad graduate engineering students were women\u2014almost three times the na\u00ad tional average. The engineering faculty found equally encouraging a substantial increase in transfers of A. B. students 166 ENGINEERING QUADRANGLE into the school and the enrollment of many more A. B. students in engineer\u00ad ing courses. In the words of Dean Jahn, the School of Engineering had achieved \"full integration into the academic fab\u00ad ric of the University.\" Engineering Quadrangle, The, was dedicated on October 13, 1962. Built at a cost of approximately $8 million with funds derived largely from the $53 mil\u00ad lion campaign, the Quadrangle consists of six interconnecting halls surrounding a central court, located on Olden Av\u00ad enue between Nassau Street and Pros\u00ad pect Avenue on land formerly a part of the old University Field. The Quad\u00ad rangle, whose floor area is the equiva\u00ad lent of that of seven Nassau Halls, con\u00ad tains 120 laboratories for research and instruction, over 125 faculty offices and graduate study spaces, 25 classrooms, a research library, a general purpose ma\u00ad chine shop, and a lounge and convoca\u00ad tion room. It was designed by the archi\u00ad tectural firm of Voorhees, Walker, Smith, Smith and Haines. Five of the halls, devoted to teaching and research, are named for faculty and alumni: John Maclean, Sr., Princeton's first professor of chemistry; John Thomas Duffield, Professor of Me\u00ad chanics and Mathematics; Cyrus Fogg Brackett, founder of the department of electrical engineering; George Erie Beggs, Professor of Civil Engineering; and James E. Hayes, CE. 1895 and E.E. 1897. The sixth unit, the library, is named for the class of 1900, which made the principal gift for its construc\u00ad tion. The court at the center of the quadrangle is named for architect Stephen F. Voorhees '00, a university trustee. English, Department of. Until well through the nineteenth century, Eng\u00adlish studies at Princeton, as elsewhere, were regarded as incidental to prepara\u00ad tion for the ministry, law, or public life, and as a result instruction concentrated on grammar and composition, rhetoric, and elocution. President Witherspoon's lectures on eloquence in the early days of the College were the forerunners of such studies, and indeed of criticism of contemporary writers, for he had some uncomplimentary things to say about the style of \"one Samuel Johnson.\" Although the Rev. James W. Alexan\u00ad der, Professor of Belles-Lettres, deliv\u00ad ered in 1838 what should probably be regarded as the first course of lectures in English literature, official recogni\u00ad tion of this subject in the College cata\u00ad logue had to wait until 1864 when John S. Hart was listed as \"Lecturer on Eng\u00ad lish Literature.\" Further evidence of increasing attention to English studies came in 1868, when the title of Joshua H. Mcllvaine, second incumbent of the University's oldest endowed chair, the Holmes Professorship, was changed from \"Belles-Lettres and Elocution\" to \"Belles-Lettres and English Language and Literature.\" In 1870 the first de\u00ad scription of courses ap\u00ad peared in the Catalogue, almost cer\u00ad tainly as a result of the introduction of a modified form of the elective system by President James McCosh, who had come to Princeton from Belfast two years earlier. But the main burden of instruction remained on composition, rhetoric, and language. The mid-1870s brought two key ap\u00ad pointments: Theodore W. Hunt as Ad\u00ad junct Professor of Rhetoric and Eng\u00ad lish, and James O. Murray as Holmes Professor. \"Granny\" Hunt, as he be\u00ad came affectionally known, was the first chairman of the English Department. Murray became the first dean of the faculty; a professorship was named after him. DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH 167 The growing importance of English within an expanding curriculum during the last decade of the nineteenth cen\u00ad tury is apparent from the names of the eminent scholars and teachers who joined Hunt and Murray. These in\u00ad cluded: Bliss Perry, Professor of Ora\u00ad tory and Aesthetic Criticism; Henry van Dyke, first Murray Professor; and George McLean Harper, who relin\u00ad quished the Woodhull Professorship of Modern Languages to succeed Perry as Holmes Professor. In 1902 Thomas Marc Parrott was appointed Professor of English. The stage was now set for the estab\u00ad lishment of a Department of English in 1904 and its rapid expansion a year later, when President Wilson added to the current nucleus of professors seven preceptors, among whom were: Gor\u00ad don H. Gerould, Francis C. Mac- Donald, Charles G. Osgood, Robert K. Root, and J. Duncan Spaeth. With the addition, in the years immediately fol\u00ad lowing, of such preceptors as Morris W. Croll and Charles W. Kennedy, the department attained a position of na\u00ad tional prominence that it has continued to enjoy. The founding members of the de\u00ad partment embodied to a remarkable ex\u00ad tent the qualities that came to be as\u00ad sociated with Princeton's ideal of the teacher-scholar. English shared with Greek Literature, Roman Literature, and Philosophy the distinction of being the first of the humanistic departments to be able to offer, after the new Graduate School was founded in 1901, a full roster of graduate as well as un\u00ad dergraduate courses. The authoritative learning of the members of the English faculty enabled them to preside over a program of graduate studies that had only three or four rivals, while their devotion to humane values made them among the most popular and influential undergraduate teachers. Despite the scholarly reputations they built up through their publications, none was confined in intellectual range to his field of specialization. Harper com\u00ad bined pioneer research on Wordsworth with the teaching of courses covering the entire Renaissance; Parrott was equally at home with Shakespeare, Renaissance drama, and the broad field of Victorian literature; Osgood, cele\u00ad brated for his variorum edition of Spenser, was also an authority on Mil\u00ad ton and Johnson; Gerould, who intro\u00ad duced the first course entirely devoted to prose fiction, was known for his mas\u00ad tery of early narrative poetry, espe\u00ad cially the ballad. Root, whose teaching embraced Chaucer, the eighteenth century, and a famous course in the history of the language, in addition held successively the positions of the depart\u00ad mental chairman and dean of the fac\u00ad ulty. His brilliance as a teacher is com\u00ad memorated in \"Root's Alumni Precep\u00ad torial,\" a group of alumni who met with Root periodically for dinner and discus\u00ad sion of assigned reading from the 1920s until his death in 1950, and since then have continued to meet similarly with other members of the English faculty. During the late 1920s and 1930s a new generation of teacher-scholars came forward. Hoyt H. Hudson, later departmental chairman, reaffirmed the University's ancient allegiance to rhetoric and public speaking. His suc\u00ad cessors were Wilbur S. Howell, who established an international reputation for his studies in the history of rhetoric, and Jeremiah S. Finch, who was later also dean of the College and secretary of the University. Spaeth had offered a course in American literature as early as 1919. Joining the faculty in 1926, Willard Thorp, with his studies in Mel\u00ad ville and others, gave the department a leadership in American studies that 168 DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH eventuated in 1942 with the establish\u00ad ment of a Program in American Civili\u00ad zation. In 1939 he was joined by Law- rance R. Thompson, who that year was appointed official biographer of Robert Frost. They were joined subsequently by Richard Ludwig, who is chief bib\u00ad liographer for the Literary History of the United States, of which Thorp was one of the founders; and still later by William Howarth, chief editor of an edition of Thoreau's complete works issued by Princeton University Press with the aid of the National Endow\u00ad ment for the Humanities. Bliss Perry in the 1890s originated a tradition of brilliant literary criticism, carried on by an unbroken line, which included Morris W. Croll, Asher E. Hinds, who gave his name to the de\u00ad partmental library, Donald A. Stauffer, Richard P. Blackmur, and A. Walton Litz. Stauffer was chairman from 1946 until his early death in 1952. He and his successors as chairman, Carlos Baker and Willard Thorp, were primarily re\u00ad sponsible for revising the curriculum to include a large number of courses in modern literature, although students were still required to be firmly grounded in earlier periods. A course in advanced composition, first offered in 1915 , was taken over in 1922 by Herbert S. Murch, who made it a breeding ground for writers. In 1939 this instruction was formalized within the Creative Arts Program, with Allen Tate as first Resident Fellow in Writing. His distinguished successor, Blackmur, became Professor of English as well. In 1971 the Program in Crea\u00ad tive Writing became a separate entity under the chairmanship of Edmund L. Keeley, novelist and translator of mod\u00ad ern Greek poetry, assisted by Theodore R. Weiss, poet and editor of Quarterly Review of Literature, and a staff of visit\u00ading writers who came for one or two years. The establishment of the Ferris Professorship of Journalism and Public Relations in 1964, with Irving Dilliard as first incumbent, provided further opportunity for students to perfect their writing skill. The decade preceding the Second World War had brought to the depart\u00ad ment two additional scholars of note, both Princeton Ph. D. s: Maurice W. Kelley, who maintained the depart\u00ad ment's eminence in Miltonic studies; and Carlos Baker, whose published works extend from Shelley to the standard biography of Ernest Heming\u00ad way. The postwar years were ones of re\u00ad building in many fields. Gerald E. Bentley, author of the seven-volume Jacobean and Caroline Stage, and Alan S. Downer, who was later chairman, expanded the teaching of dramatic lit\u00ad erature. Other major appointments in\u00ad cluded Louis A. Landa in the eight\u00ad eenth century with particular emphasis on Swift and Defoe, and Durant W. Robertson, Jr., author, notably, of A Preface to Chaucer, in medieval stud\u00ad ies. Robert B. Martin, an accomplished writer in many fields, joined E. D.H. Johnson in guiding the expansion of Victorian studies. The appointments of Hans Aarsleff and of Albert H. Marck- wardt guaranteed that the department would continue to encourage the atten\u00ad tion to Old English and linguistics first nurtured by Theodore W. Hunt and Charles W. Kennedy. The Departments of English and History have for many years shared, in friendly rivalry, the distinction of hav\u00ad ing the largest number of upperclass concentrators. With the advent of coeducation the number of outstanding students electing English studies in\u00ad creased notably. At the same time the ENROLLMENT 169 department welcomed women to its teaching staff; their number had reached seven in 1974. In the precep\u00ad torial and lecture rooms of McCosh Hall, the department's teacher-scholar tradition continued to flourish. E.D.H. Johnson Eno Hall at the time of its completion in 1924 was, in Professor Howard Crosby Warren's words, \"the first labo\u00ad ratory in this country, if not in the world, dedicated solely to the teaching and investigation of scientific psycholo\u00ad gy. \" It was named in honor of the prin\u00ad cipal donor, Henry Lane Eno, Re\u00ad search Associate in Psychology. An\u00ad other donor, then anonymous, was Pro\u00ad fessor Warren, chairman of the depart\u00ad ment, for whom, as President Hibben pointed out, the laboratory was the realization of a dream he had long cherished. The Department of Psychology oc\u00ad cupied Eno Hall until 1963 when it was given larger quarters, along with the Department of Sociology, in John C. Green Hall. Eno was subsequently used by the Department of Biology to supplement its facilities in Guyot Hall. Eno Hall was designed by Day & Klauder. Above its front door is the motto originally carved over the portal of the Oracle of Delphi in ancient Greece: Gnothi Sauton [KnowThyself]. Enrollment in the College of New Jer\u00ad sey when President Jonathan Dickin\u00ad son began instruction in his Elizabeth- town parsonage in 1747 probably num\u00ad bered not more than ten students. Dur\u00ad ing the College's first twenty-one years, the 338 students in attendance came from all but two of the thirteen col\u00ad onies. Although the majority lived in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsyl\u00ad vania, more than a quarter were from New England, and a fair number from the South, thus putting the College \"on the way to becoming a national institu\u00ad tion well before there was a nation.\"* After 1768, President Witherspoon was particularly successful in attracting students from the South, where earlier graduates had formed strong Princeton influences as ministers and teachers. Under Witherspoon, the College en\u00ad joyed a cosmopolitan flavor, with stu\u00ad dents \"not only from almost every prov\u00ad ince,\" Philip in his senior year, \"but . . . also many from the West Indies & some few from Europe.\" Enrollment reached 314 by 1860 and then fell off during and after the Civil War. It resumed its upward trend under President McCosh, with the number of undergraduates doubling in his administration and again in Presi\u00ad dent Patton's and rising steadily under Presidents Wilson (1,289), Hibben (2,279), Dodds (2,948), and Goheen (3,903). In later years this rise was a controlled one, based on a policy of lim\u00ad ited enrollment and selective admission adopted in 1922. The Civil War reduced the flow of students from the South, and although they never regained their numerical prominence\u2014at times half the stu\u00ad dent body had been southern\u2014the general enrollment rise later in the cen\u00ad tury brought with it a proportionate in\u00ad crease in the number of southern stu\u00ad dents. Appreciable enrollments from the Middle West began in the 1880s and from the Far West in the 1920s. Al\u00ad though the largest number of under\u00ad graduates, as of 1976, continued to come from New York (917), New Jersey 170 EVELYN COLLEGE FOR WOMEN (767), and Pennsylvania (442), there were substantial enrollments from states in New England, the South, the Middle West, the Southwest, and the Far West. In those regions the states with the largest enrollments were Mas\u00ad sachusetts (302), Virginia (129), Illinois (94), Texas (124), and California (156), respectively. Until the 1870s Princeton's enroll\u00ad ment was entirely undergraduate ex\u00ad cept for occasional non-degree post\u00ad graduate students. The number of candidates for higher degrees steadily increased under President McCosh, and by the time the Graduate School was formally established in 1901 there were 117. After the First World War, enrollment in the Graduate School was limited to 200, and then 250, but fol\u00ad lowing the Second World War, a policy of controlled expansion was adopted, al\u00ad lowing a marked rise in the number en\u00ad rolled. A considerable influx of students from other countries after the Second World War added to the cosmopolitan character of the student body. In 1976 approximately 4 percent of the under\u00ad graduates and 22 percent of the gradu\u00ad ate students came from outside the United States. Two University decisions in the 1960s further increased the diversity of student enrollment: the adoption of an active recruitment policy for blacks and other minority groups, and the decision to admit women to the Graduate School and later to the undergraduate college. By 1976, total student enrollment had grown to 5,775, with representa\u00ad tives from every state in the Union and from seventy countries on six conti\u00ad nents. It consisted of 4,360 under\u00ad graduates, including 1,395 women, 346 blacks, and 351 members of other minority groups; and 1,415 graduate students, including 367 women, 38 blacks, and 185 representing other minority groups. Earle E. Coleman * James McLachlan, Princetonians 1748-1768; A Biographical Dictionary (Princeton University Press, 1976). Evelyn College for Women created a pleasant stir in the borough of Princeton for ten years toward the end of the last century. Founded in 1887 by a 72-year-old clergyman and former Princeton professor, Joshua Hall McIl- vaine 1837, who named it after Sir John Evelyn, seventeenth-century man of letters, the college was housed in two buildings about a mile east of the center of town, one on what is now called Eve\u00ad lyn Place, the other on the southwest corner of Nassau and Harrison Streets. Although Evelyn had no legal con\u00ad nection with Princeton, it enjoyed most of the benefits of a coordinate college. President Patton, Dean Murray, and Professors Marquand and Young were on its board of trustees, and most of Princeton's senior professors lectured there. Enrollment was small, probably never more than fifty in one year, made up largely of daughters of professors in the College and the Seminary and sis\u00ad ters of Princeton undergraduates. When the newly formed Colonial Club rented the house next door to Evelyn College for its first clubhouse, it found its competitive position strengthened vis-a-vis the three slightly older eating clubs, and although Presi\u00ad dent Mcllvaine complained to Presi\u00ad dent Patton that Colonial's proximity meant the ruination of Evelyn, the club was allowed to enjoy its advantage until the expiration of its year's lease. During the four-year depression that followed the Panic of 1893, hard times kept down enrollment and also di-FACULTY 171 minished the chances of obtaining any sizable gifts for endowment and build\u00ad ings. After President Mcllvaine died in 1897, Evelyn College closed its doors forever, and Princeton had to wait al\u00ad most three quarters of a century before education for women within its pre\u00ad cincts became a reality. (See Women.) Faculty. A persistent influence in the evolution of Princeton University has been the concept of a single, integrated faculty. As other universities have ex\u00ad panded, their faculties have usually di\u00ad vided into semiautonomous schools, held together more by financial con\u00ad trols and physical services than by common policies and objectives. At Princeton, a single faculty, with the President presiding, oversees a wide range of educational functions in\u00ad cluding admissions, curriculum, in\u00ad struction, research, discipline, exami\u00ad nations, standing, and extracurricular life. Through its standing committees, it advises the President on faculty ap\u00ad pointments and advancements and on general university policy. It also pro\u00ad vides a channel of communication and appeal to the Board of Trustees. The integrated structure of the Princeton faculty as a policy-making body has survived because of the Uni\u00ad versity's deep-set urge to limit size in order to sustain the quality of both its faculty and its students, to emphasize the fundamental branches of learning, to encourage their mutual reinforce\u00ad ment, and to preserve a common, man-centered approach to education in the liberal tradition. With but gradual expansion of the fields of study, and the close coordination of new fields to old, the need for atomization into sharp\u00ad ly differentiated schools has been avoided. Much of the work of the \"Faculty of Princeton University\" is done by elected standing committees. These in\u00ad clude: (a) policy committees, such as those on the Course of Study, the Graduate School, Undergraduate Ad\u00ad mission and Financial Aid, as well as the University Research Board; (b) ad\u00ad visory committees, such as those on Appointments and Advancements, Pol\u00ad icy, and Conference; and (c) adminis\u00ad trative committees, such as on Athletic Eligibility, Examinations and Stand\u00ad ing, Library, Public Lectures, and the Schedule. Policy and administrative committees report to the faculty at its regular monthly meetings. The educa\u00ad tional policies of the University have long been the product of thorough study and lively debate by a faculty which through these orderly proce\u00ad dures assumes an unusual degree of concern and responsibility. The presi\u00ad dent and deans exercise their influence upon these policies far more through their leadership in the faculty and its committees than through any assump\u00ad tion of ex officio authority. The operating unit which imple\u00ad ments the educational policies of the University is the department whose functions include the administration of instruction, the planning of curriculum, oversight of research activities and facil\u00ad ities, and the recruitment and devel\u00ad opment of effective teacher-scholars. The chairman of a department is ap\u00ad pointed by the president, after consul\u00ad tation, from among its senior members. His term is limited, and rotation in office is normal. As with the faculty, the responsibility for departmental ac\u00ad tivities is shared by its members, through the assignment of functions to committees or representatives, whose work is closely coordinated by over\u00ad sight and decision by the department as a whole. 172 FACULTY The integration of the operating and planning functions of the teaching de\u00ad partment with the policy and review functions of the University Faculty may be illustrated by two long-established procedures among many. In revising or expanding its curriculum, the depart\u00ad ment must recommend any change to the University-wide Committee on the Course of Study at the undergraduate level or to the Committee on the Graduate School in the case of graduate programs. If the change is approved by the appropriate committee, it is rec\u00ad ommended to the University faculty for action. With Princeton's long tradition of a tightly controlled curriculum, the process of planning and review is thor\u00ad ough at all stages of the procedure. The second procedure concerns the area of faculty appointments and ad\u00ad vancements. The present quality, effec\u00ad tiveness, and morale, of the Princeton faculty is owing in large measure to the responsible participation of its senior members. To be appointed or pro\u00ad moted to or within the professorial ranks, a candidate must be judged by all the senior members of a depart\u00ad ment. If the candidate is approved by the department, a full and formal rec\u00ad ommendation is sent to the dean of the faculty, who lays it before the Advisory Committee on Appointments and Ad\u00ad vancements for careful study. This committee, traditionally called the \"Committee of Three,\" now in\u00ad cludes four voting members elected annually by the faculty from among the chairmen of departments, one from each of the four major divisions of the University. The committee, with the president, the provost, the dean of the faculty, the dean of the Graduate School, and the dean of the College \"in attendance,\" advises the president on all proposals for the appointment or ad\u00advancement in salary or rank of faculty personnel beyond first appointment as an assistant professor. In addition to re\u00ad viewing the extensive materials for\u00ad warded by departments, it may seek outside evaluations of candidates or ask chairmen to appear before it. After full discussion by all present, it is the vote of the four elected members of the committee which the president takes under advisement in exercising his sole responsibility of recommending action by the Board of Trustees. Another consolidating influence upon the Princeton faculty, which exercises as great a degree of responsibility as in any American university, is the concept of continuing tenure, Attained only after the thorough-going review out\u00ad lined above, whether through step-by- step advancement to the rank of as\u00ad sociate professor, reappointment at that rank, or first appointment as a full pro\u00ad fessor, the award of tenure encourages the member to feel that he is a \"manag\u00ad ing partner\" in an ongoing institution. His responsibilities are clear and re\u00ad warding at both the University and the departmental level. He comes to have a long-run stake in the overall quality of the institution and in the strength and progress of his own discipline within it. If there were no other argument for academic tenure in higher education, at Princeton it could be strongly defended as a force for enhancing faculty respon\u00ad sibility and morale, as well as for thor\u00ad oughness and concern in the selection of those to whom it is awarded. In American higher education gener\u00ad ally, the usual justification of academic tenure is either, at the philosophical level, the assurance of academic free\u00ad dom, or at the practical, personal level, the assurance of security against loss of job. In an older institution, with a tight-knit faculty, the major protection FACULTY SONG 173 against arbitrary dismissal because of unpopular opinions is the tradition of the institution, supported by well- established procedures for faculty, presidential, and trustee review. At the same time, a strong feeling of mutual responsibility reduces the likelihood of the abuse of freedom. At the practical, personal level, it is unlikely at a strong, older institution that arbitrary termina\u00ad tions of senior personnel will become necessary for reasons of institutional finance. At Princeton, the policy of awarding continuing tenure has been far more a means of assuring a strong and responsible faculty than a needed safeguard of a long-cherished tradition of academic freedom. J. Douglas Brown Faculty Song, a ballad about their pro\u00ad fessors, has been sung by Princeton seniors on the steps of Nassau Hall on Spring evenings since 1895. The verses are generally irreverent, sometimes Moderate barbed, but seldom ill-natured. Cam\u00ad pus favorites other than faculty mem\u00ad bers have been sung about, too. The tune, a sample verse, and the chorus are shown below. The idea of the song was borrowed from students at Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut by Andrew C. Imbrie, 1895, who composed the first verses. He and his classmates did not inquire about the origin of the tune at the time; years later they were de\u00ad lighted to learn from a Scottish bagpipe band that played the Faculty Song at a class reunion that it was an old Scottish ballad, \"The Muckin' o' Geordie's Dung from George's Cowshed\"). The life expectancy of the average faculty verse is only a few years, but some have gone on for a decade or more. A verse for Professor William Berryman Scott, composed in 1902, was still being sung in 1919. Another, celebrating the arrival of the original preceptors in 1905, was still being sung Arranged by Kenneth S. Clark, '05 mmm ^ E 0- * Here's to .

Some of the best known per\u00ad sonalities like Walter P. Hall, J. Dun\u00ad can Spaeth, Dean Eisenhart, and Dean Gauss, had a different verse sung about them almost every other year. Count\u00ad less verses have been sung over the years.

FRANK ALBERT FETTER 175 Fencing was introduced to Princeton in 1856, when Karl Langlotz, lately ar\u00ad rived from Germany, found temporary employment in teaching it to a class of fifty students; he subsequently taught German and composed the music to Old Nassau. Later in the century, spo\u00ad radic fencing clubs fostered intramural competition. In 1905 a three-year spell of intercollegiate competition began when a devotee of the sport, Henry S. Breckinridge '07 (later president of the Amateur Fencers League of America) organized a team that beat Yale in 1906 and 1907. A Fencing Association, organized in 1924, created such interest that fencing was recognized as a team sport and in\u00ad tercollegiate competition was begun in 1926. An outstanding performer in the early years was Tracy Jaeckel 28, who was intercollegiate champion in epee his senior year. Captain F. G. McPherson, team coach in 1926, was succeeded a year later by Joseph De Vos, former fencing instructor at the court of Holland, who in turn was succeeded in 1933 by Hu\u00ad bert H. Pirotte, who was coach until the outbreak of World War II. During this period two Princeton fencers won indi\u00ad vidual titles at the Eastern Intercol- legiates: William T. Pecora '33 (foil) in 1933, and Kirk Alexander, Jr. '37 (epee) in 1935; Princeton won the epee team title in 1940. The 1935 captain, Todd Harris, established annual fencing medals on his graduation and later or\u00ad ganized alumni financial support. Stanley S. Sieja became coach in 1946. His teams defeated both Harvard and Yale in 1949, 1952, 1956, 1959, and 1960, and again in ten successive years, from 1962 through 1971, winning its six\u00ad teenth Big Three championship in 1973. Princeton shared the Ivy crown in 1959, 1960, 1966, and 1969, and won it outright in 1975. At the Eastern In- tercollegiates, Princeton won the epee team title in 1960, and both the foil team title and the three-weapon cham\u00ad pionship in 1969. At the annual NCAA tournament, Sieja's teams finished third in 1960 and 1965, took second place in 1961, and captured the na\u00ad tional championship in 1964. Eight of Sieja's fencers won individ\u00ad ual championships. Five were Eastern intercollegiate champions: Chambless Johnston '51 (saber) in 1949; Anger in in 1972; and James Neale '77 (epee) in 1977. Four were champions: Hicks (foil) in 1964. Three fencers were voted NCAA Fencer of the Year: Anger in 1961, Hicks in 1964, and John Nonna '70 in 1969. Sieja was elected Coach of the Year by the Na\u00ad tional Fencing Coaches Association in 1964, 1968, and 1976, and was inducted into the Helms Foundation Hall of Fame in 1967. Fetter, Frank Albert (1863-1949), first chairman of the Department of Eco\u00ad nomics and Social Institutions, was a philosopher-theorist whose Indiana- Quaker upbringing drove him to use his great powers of theoretical analysis for the advancement of public policy and human welfare. The Economics Department still bears his imprint. Born in Peru, Indiana, in 1863, Fet\u00ad ter was obliged to interrupt his course of study at Indiana University for eight years while he assumed the financial responsibilities of his disabled father. Finally graduating in 1891, he went on to Cornell, the Sorbonne, and to Halle, where he received a Ph.D. in 1894. He 176 FRANK ALBERT FETTER returned to Cornell as an instructor but soon left for a professorship at Indiana University. Stanford called him west in 1898, but he resigned three years later in protest against violation of academic freedom. He returned to Cornell, where his international reputation as an economic theorist grew rapidly during the next decade. In 1911, having re\u00ad fused earlier offers from Yale and Co\u00ad lumbia, he accepted Princeton's invita\u00ad tion to become chairman of its com\u00ad bined Department of History, Politics, and Economics. Two years later, Fetter became chairman of the new Department of Economics and Social Institutions. For eleven years, he guided the develop\u00ad ment of a rapidly expanding program. Although he officially retired as a pro\u00ad fessor in 1931, he continued as a special lecturer in economic theory for two more years, and as a productive scholar and a vigorous exponent of economic justice until his death in 1949 at the age of 86. Some indication of the distinguished position that Professor Fetter attained among American economists was his election to the presidency of the American Economic Association when he was only 49. He was also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sci\u00ad ences and an active member of the American Philosophical Society. In 1927, the Austrian Economic Society awarded him its Karl Menger Medal. He received his first honorary degree of LL. D. from Colgate at 46 and his last from Princeton at 82. He was much in demand by other universities as visiting professor or lecturer. Professor Fetter's major scholarly contributions were in the field of fun\u00ad damental economic theory, including the theories of value, the concepts of value and price, capitalization, time preference, interest, and rent. Influ\u00ad enced by repeated visits to Austria, he emphasized subjective and psychologi\u00ad cal factors. He was at heart a \"welfare economist,\" often at odds with those he considered too concerned with \"price economics.\" His incisive understanding of the factors in price determination, however, made him in later years a vig\u00ad orous opponent of monopoly because of its effect upon the welfare of consum\u00ad ers. He was a prolific writer of scholarly articles. Most Princeton undergradu\u00ad ates of the 1920s studied, with mixed emotions, his famous texts, Economic Principles and Modern Economic Prob\u00ad lems. Professor Fetter was at his best in face-to-face interchange with col\u00ad leagues and graduate students. Here his intellectual acumen, penetrating analysis, keen wit, and, above all, his intuitive integrity and warm personal charm came through. He was loved and admired not only for himself but also for his concern for people and their problems. His insight, courage, and integrity were communicated with such friendly warmth and dry humor that his influ\u00ad ence upon colleagues and students reached far beyond their hard-earned mastery of economic theory. He en\u00ad couraged students to become involved in public service in solving the prob\u00ad lems of education, poverty, mental ill\u00ad ness, juvenile delinquency, and bad housing. His extracurricular activities in these fields became the basis of a pioneering Princeton course in sociol\u00ad ogy which, despite its campus label, \"Travelling Gut,\" took many students for their first time into asylums, pris\u00ad ons, and slums, and deepened their understanding of human tragedy and social responsibility. By his example, he reinforced Woodrow Wilson's goal HENRY BURCHARD FINE 177 for Princeton\u2014that its faculty and stu\u00ad dents should serve their fellow men by acts as well as by ideas. ]. Doughs Brown Field Hockey began propitiously in November 1971 with the first contest between Princeton and Yale women on the day of the annual Yale-Princeton football game. Of all the Princeton-Yale athletic contests played that day, women's field hockey provided the only Princeton victory, with an historic 3-2 win over Yale. For the first five years, the Princeton women never lost to the Yale women . . . nor to many other women either. The season records speak for them\u00ad selves: 1971, 5-2; 1972, 7-3-1; 1973, 8-3; 1974, undefeated; 1975, unde\u00ad feated. From 1972 through 1975 Princeton was the Big Three and Ivy League Champion. During the same short five-year pe\u00ad riod, the women's athletic program was organizing and fielding fourteen inter\u00ad collegiate teams and achieving an aggregate winning percentage of .800. The women's field hockey team has contributed greatly to that winning ef\u00ad fort. Merrily Dean Baker Fine, Henry Burchard (1858-1928), the first and only dean of the depart\u00ad ments of science, was one of the men who did most to help Princeton de\u00ad velop from a college into a university. He made Princeton a leading center for mathematics and fostered the growth of creative work in other branches of sci\u00ad ence as well. Nationally he was one of the group of men who, in Professor Oswald Veblen's words, \"carried Amer\u00ad ican mathematics forward from a state of approximate nullity to one verging on parity with the European nations.\" Fine was the oldest of four children of a Presbyterian minister of Dutch an\u00ad cestry in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. His father died when the children were young, and they were brought up by their mother, an able woman of strong character. (Three of her children be\u00ad came educators: Dean Fine; John B. Fine 1882, founder of the Princeton Preparatory School; and May Margaret Fine, founder of Miss Fine's School.) The family came to live in Princeton in 1875, and Henry entered the College the following year, graduating in 1880. Fine played the flute in the college orchestra, rowed on one of the crews, and served for three years as an editor of the Princetonian, where he began a life-long friendship with Woodrow Wil\u00ad son 1879, whom he succeeded as man\u00ad aging editor. Fine was also one of the small group of undergraduates who took part in President McCosh's bi\u00ad weekly \"library meetings\" at Prospect. He led his class all four years and was Latin salutatorian at Commencement. Although he specialized in Latin and Greek, he adopted mathematics as a career toward the end of his college course, largely through the influence of George B. Halstead 1875, a tutor of mathematics who communicated his enthusiasm for his subject to Fine. After a postgraduate year as Class of 1860 Fellow in Experimental Science and three years as tutor in mathe\u00ad matics, Fine went to Leipzig to study with the eminent geometer Felix Klein. Although, according to his own account, he knew very little German and almost no mathematics, he devel\u00ad oped so rapidly that he obtained his Ph.D. in a little more than a year. After this brief contact with the main current of mathematics, Fine returned 178 HENRY BURCHARD FINE to Princeton in 1885 as an assistant professor. He was promoted to profes\u00ad sor in 1889, appointed Dod Professor of Mathematics in 1898, and made chair\u00ad man of the department when depart\u00ad ments were first organized in 1904. Early in his career he published a few research papers but, as time went on, he devoted his energies more to teach\u00ad ing and to the logical exposition of elementary mathematics. According to Professor Veblen, his widely used text\u00ad books, A College Algebra (1905) and Calculus (1927) were unexcelled in accuracy of statement and the adequacy with which they represented the sub\u00ad ject. His College Algebra was not found easy by beginning students who, when first confronted with it, according to a Princetonian of that era, \"decided that no one could understand it but Profes\u00ad sor Fine and God.\" When the students of the following year were treated to a revised edition \"they agreed that com\u00ad prehension was probably now limited to Professor Fine alone.\" FINE AND WILSON After Woodrow Wilson returned to Princeton as professor of jurisprudence in 1890, he and Fine resumed the close friendship they had begun in college days, sharing both a serious devotion to the life of the scholar and a keen inter\u00ad est in college sports. They served to\u00ad gether on a faculty committee on ath\u00ad letics and on another one that corrected abuses arising from the admission of \"special students,\" who enjoyed the pleasures of college life without having to meet the academic standards re\u00ad quired of candidates for a degree. Both also worked for the adoption of the honor system in examinations. In 1903, shortly after he became president of the University, Wilson ap\u00ad pointed Fine dean of the faculty, and Fine's energies were thereafter de\u00ad voted chiefly to university administra\u00ad tion. He worked shoulder to shoulder with Wilson in improving the cur\u00ad riculum and strengthening the faculty, and bore the onus of the student dis\u00ad missals made inevitable by the raising of academic standards. In the con\u00ad troversies over the quad plan and the graduate college, Fine supported Wil\u00ad son completely. After Wilson resigned to run for governor of New Jersey in 1910, Fine, as dean of the faculty, car\u00ad ried the chief burden of the university administration during an interregnum of two years; and when the trustees elected John Grier Hibben as Wilsons successor, Fine, who many had thought would receive the election, magnani\u00ad mously pledged Hibben his whole\u00ad hearted support. \"He was singularly free from petty prejudices and always had the courage of his convictions,\" Hibben later recalled. \"Every word and act was absolutely in character, and he was completely dependable in every emergency.\" After his election as president of the United States, Wilson urged Fine to accept appointment as Ambassador to Germany and later as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, but Fine de\u00ad clined both appointments, saying quite simply that he preferred to remain at Princeton as a professor of mathe\u00ad matics. Fine also declined a call to the presidency of Johns Hopkins Univer\u00ad sity and several to the presidency of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. DEAN OF THE DEPARTMENTS OF SCIENCE The introduction of the preceptorial system in 1905 required a considerable expansion of the faculty in the hu\u00ad manities and social studies. Fine per\u00ad suaded Wilson that a similar enlarge-HENRY BURCHARD FINE 179 ment was desirable in the sciences, and, seizing the opportunity, began to build a department of mathematics of the first rank while at the same time helping his colleagues lay the founda\u00ad tions for strong departments in other sciences. In this endeavor he was greatly aided by the force of his person\u00ad ality, by his remarkable ability to dis\u00ad cern talent in younger men before it had become widely recognized, and by an unselfish interest in furthering their careers. For suggestions and advice, Fine turned first to his friend, Sir Joseph J. Thomson, the Cambridge physicist who had been his house guest at the University's Sesquicentennial Celebra\u00ad tion in 1896 when Thomson received an honorary degree and had discussed with Fine the latter's hopes for making Princeton a scientific center. As a re\u00ad sult, James Jeans came to Princeton in 1905 as professor of mathematical physics and O. W. Richardson the fol\u00ad lowing year as professor of experimen\u00ad tal physics. A survey of younger math\u00ad ematicians in this country led to other promotions and appointments. Luther P. Eisenhart was promoted to a precep- torship and Oswald Veblen, Gilbert A. Bliss, and John W. Young were brought to Princeton at the same rank. When Bliss and Young were called elsewhere they were replaced by two equally bril\u00ad liant mathematicians, George D. Birk- hoff and the Scots J. H. M. Wedder- burn. Professor Veblen recalled that Fine's department had the services of a considerable proportion of the best mathematicians, of America in his time. \"In every case,\" Veblen said, \"these men were called in before they became well known, at the time when recogni\u00ad tion meant the most to them. Though many of them stayed only a few years, their contact with Fine and his group was important both to them and in the continuing growth of this group as an organism.\" Fine recognized the genius of Henry Norris Russell 1897 when Russell was an undergraduate and saw to it that this future astrophysicist was given every opportunity to develop his talents at Princeton and that every means, was taken to keep him there. It was Fine who later persuaded Russell's class\u00ad mates to endow a research professor\u00ad ship for him. Fine was also instrumen\u00ad tal in bringing Edwin Grant Conklin, the biologist, and George A. Hulett, the physical chemist, to Princeton. In 1909 when the dean of the fac\u00ad ulty's duties were lightened by the cre\u00ad ation of the office of the dean of the col\u00ad lege, Fine became in title what he had been in fact\u2014dean of the departments of science. When Hibben became pres\u00ad ident in 1912, Fine resigned as dean of the faculty but continued as dean of the departments of science. In his last years he was able to seize another opportu\u00ad nity for the advancement of science at Princeton. Largely because of the con\u00ad fidence he inspired, the General Edu\u00ad cation Board offered Princeton a mil\u00ad lion dollars for research in pure science on condition that the University raise two million for the same purpose. The fund was completed in 1928, chiefly by the contributions of Thomas D. Jones 1876, a wealthy alumnus who was strik\u00ad ingly similar to Fine in qualities of in\u00ad tellect and character. Jones had be\u00ad come a close friend of Fine's during Wilson's presidency\u2014a friendship com\u00ad memorated by the Henry B. Fine Pro\u00ad fessorship of Mathematics, founded by Jones, and the Thomas D. Jones Pro\u00ad fessorship of Mathematical Physics, founded by Miss Gwethalyn Jones. As a further memorial, Jones and his niece gave a building for mathematics, named Fine Hall, which was built in 1930. When a larger building for math-180 FINE HALL ematics was constructed in 1968, it was named Fine Hall (q.v.) and the former mathematics building, converted for use by other departments, was re\u00ad named Jones Hall (q.v.) in honor of the original donors. Fine was one of the founders of the American Mathematical Society and its president in 1911 and 1912. In the summer of 1928, he went to Europe, where he revisited old scenes and old friends, and recovered to some extent, in the distractions of travel, from the sorrows he had suffered in the recent death of his wife and the earlier deaths of two of his three children. Professor Veblen who talked with him soon after his return, reported later that Fine \"spoke with humorous appreciation of the change he had observed in the at\u00ad titude of European mathematicians to\u00ad ward their American colleagues and with pride of the esteem in which he had found his own department to be held.\" Tall and erect, Dean Fine was a familiar figure on his bicycle, which he rode to and from classes and used for long rides in the country. While riding his bicycle on the way to visit his brother at the Princeton Preparatory School late one December afternoon, he was struck from behind by an au\u00ad tomobile whose driver had failed to see him in the uncertain light of dusk. He died the next morning without having recovered consciousness, three months after his seventieth birthday. Shortly after Fine's death, Professor Veblen visited Europe and met some of the mathematicians Fine had seen on his last trip, many of them younger men who had met Fine for the first time. They all spoke [Veblen wrote] of his charm of manner and of the impres\u00adsion they had gained of a man of serene strength and poise and wis\u00ad dom. It was a striking testimony to the way in which a man's character can be written into his appearance and manner by a long and strenuous life. Fine Hall, home of the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Statistics, was dedicated in 1970 as a memorial to Henry Burchard Fine (q.v.), the central figure in the early development of the mathematics fac\u00ad ulty of the University. It replaced an older Fine Hall, built forty years ear\u00ad lier, which was renamed Jones Hall (q.v.). Fine Hall, which with its neighbor Jadwin Hall forms a center for mathe\u00ad matics and physics, is just west of Palmer Stadium. Fine Hall comprises a long three-story building, topped by a tower often additional floors. It is sepa\u00ad rated from Jadwin Hall by a plaza covering the underground joint math\u00ad ematics-physics library. The long, three-story section con\u00ad tains classrooms and graduate student offices and studies. On the third floor is a common room with portraits of Dean Fine and two earlier Princeton mathe\u00ad maticians, Walter Minto and Albert B. Dod. On the second floor are two study rooms named for Luther P. Eisenhart, Fine's successor as chairman of the De\u00ad partment of Mathematics, and Samuel S. Wilks, founder of the Department of Statistics. The vertical lines of the tower coun\u00ad terbalance the horizontal mass of Jad\u00ad win Hall and provide a focal point for this architectural unit. Each floor of the tower, except the topmost, contains seven faculty offices and one seminar room. The entire top story is devoted to a professors' lounge, whose large pic-SAMUEL FINLEY 181 ture windows afford panoramic views of the campus and the surrounding coun\u00ad tryside. Fine Hall was designed by Warner, Burns, Toan and Lunde of New York City, and together with Jadwin Hall won in 1966 an Award of Merit in the Architectural Design Award Program. Finley, Samuel (1715-1766), fifth pres\u00ad ident of Princeton, was a Scotch- Irishman who came to this country with his parents when he was nineteen. He is thought to have attended William Tennent's Log College (q.v.) at Neshaminy, Bucks County, Pennsylva\u00ad nia. His early career as an evangelical preacher was marked by an energetic, contentious, and sometimes acrimoni\u00ad ous spirit that was not uncommon in the eighteenth-century religious revi\u00ad vals known as The Great Awakening. In Cape May he once carried on a two-day debate with a Baptist minister on infant baptism; he called a collection of ser\u00ad mons on the evils of another sect \"Satan Stripp'dof His Angelic Robe. . . .\"Dur\u00ad ing a pastorate in Milford, Connecticut, he was arrested on his way to preach to the Second Society at New Haven, a \"separatist\" congregation then illegal under Connecticut law, and was ex\u00ad pelled from the colony as a vagrant. For the next seventeen years he was pastor of the church at Nottingham, Maryland, where he also conducted an academy renowned for its standards of scholarship and for training such men as Benjamin Rush 1760, physician and signer of the Declaration of Independence, and Ebenezer Hazard 1762, United States postmaster general. With increasing maturity Finley became less conten\u00ad tious and more effective in his preach\u00ad ing. Ebenezer Hazard said his sermons \"were calculated to inform the igno\u00ad rant, to alarm the careless and secure, and to edify and comfort the faithful.\" Finley was given an honorary degree by the University of Glasgow, the first Princeton president and the second American divine to receive an honorary degree abroad. Finley, who had been one of the original trustees of the col\u00ad lege, succeeded Samuel Davies as pres\u00ad ident on May 31, 1761. At the time of his election he was regarded as \"a very accurate scholar, and a very great and good man.\" Finley's presidency was marked by steady growth in enrollment, by his planting of shade trees\u2014two sycamores that he planted in front of the Presi\u00ad dent's House (now the Maclean House) are still standing\u2014and by his effective teaching. He was \"a man of small stat\u00ad ure, and of round and ruddy counte\u00ad nance,\" respected and beloved by the students. In his fifty-second year he died in Philadelphia, where he had gone for medical treatment; many stu\u00ad dents journeyed from Princeton to pay their last respects, and eight members of the senior class bore his body to the grave. Midway in Finley's administration the trustees declared, \"Our idea is to send into the World good Scholars and useful members of Society.\" Some of the 130 graduates Finley sent out dur\u00ad ing his five-year presidency more than fulfilled this modest purpose, notably the Rev. James Manning 1762, founder and first president of Brown University; William Paterson 1763, governor of New Jersey; the Rt. Rev. Thomas J. Clagget 1764, Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Diocese of Maryland; the Rev. Samuel Kirkland 1765, founder and first president of Hamilton College (for whom Hamilton's sister college, opened in 1968, was named); David Ramsay 1765, physician and historian of the American Revolution; Oliver Ells-182 JOHN M. T. FINNEY worth 1766, chief justice of the United States. Samuel Finley Breese Morse, devel\u00ad oper of the telegraph, was the great grandson of President Finley; in 1870 he gave the portrait of Finley which hangs in the Faculty Room in Nassau Hall. Finney, John M. T. 1884 (1863-1942), was the only person ever to play foot\u00ad ball for both Princeton and Harvard. He was an end on the Princeton varsity his senior year and held the same posi\u00ad tion on the Harvard varsity during his first year at the Harvard Medical School. (The rule restricting eligibility to undergraduates had not yet been adopted.) In Princetons victory over Harvard his senior year, Finney scored Prince\u00ad ton's only touchdown. At the Harvard Medical School he abstained from play\u00ad ing against Princeton. A scrappy player, Finney's hard tackle of a back in the Yale game his senior year led to an exchange of un- pleasantries. The following week the Police Gazette asked Finney for his photograph to include with John L. Sul\u00ad livan's in a gallery of \"the leading expo\u00ad nents of the manly art of self-defense,\" but Finney did not avail himself of this honor. \"I got credit,\" he later recalled, \"for a lot of slugging that was going on around me, in which I had no other part than that of peacemaker.\" Finney gave up football after his first season with Harvard in order to do jus\u00ad tice to his medical studies. On receiv\u00ad ing his M. D. and completing his in\u00ad ternship at the Massachusetts General Hospital, he went to Baltimore, where as professor of surgery he was as\u00ad sociated with men like William H. Welch, Sir William Osier, and William S. Halsted in developing the great medical school and hospital at Johns Hopkins. Finney specialized in surgery of the alimentary canal, for which he devised a number of important opera\u00ad tive techniques. As chief consultant in surgery for the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I, Finney organized new methods for administering surgical aid to the wounded at the front, and was decorated by the United States, France, and Belgium. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Colleges of Sur\u00ad geons of England, of Ireland, and of Edinburgh, and in 1932 was awarded the Bigelow gold medal, one of the highest honors in surgery in this coun\u00ad try. He was a founder and first presi\u00ad dent of the American College of Sur\u00ad geons. He was also president of the American Surgical Association and of the Society of Clinical Surgery. He pioneered in the recruitment and train\u00ad ing of black surgeons. The son of a clergyman, he served as vice-moderator of the General Assem\u00ad bly of the Presbyterian Church, and was a trustee of Lincoln University and of the Princeton Theological Seminary. He was cited for his contributions to better understanding among Catholics, Protestants, and Jews. Finney was elected a life trustee of Princeton in 1910 just before Woodrow Wilson resigned as president. He so impressed his colleagues by \"his simple honesty of thought, speech and action\" that less than two years later they in\u00ad vited him to be president. Finney knew the need was great (the Board, divided by the Wilson-West dispute, had pre\u00ad viously had trouble agreeing on a can\u00ad didate) and his loyalty to Princeton put him under great pressure to accept. \"His mental anguish,\" said a colleague at Johns Hopkins, \"was plain to see.\" But in the end, his innate love of medicine, and the obligation he felt to FIRES 183 the young doctors under his guidance, prevailed. \"After a most careful consid\u00ad eration from every point of view,\" he wrote, \"I feel that I am better fitted for the work which I am now doing and that I should remain in Baltimore where my work is not yet done.\" Soon thereafter Finney and John W. Barr 1885, a newcomer to the board also not identified with either the Wilson or the West faction, used their balance of power to elect John Grier Hibben as president. As chairman of the Trustees' Com\u00ad mittee on Health and Athletics, Finney helped to plan the present McCosh In\u00ad firmary, to secure its staff, and to set its tone, consistent with his personal phi\u00ad losophy, as a place where the human as well as the scientific aspects of medi\u00ad cine were emphasized. He also helped in the development of the University's intramural and intercollegiate athletic programs. The gentle Wordsworth scholar, George McLean Harper, Finney's closest friend in the Class of 1884, had a more rounded view of Finney's manly qualities than the Police Gazette had had. Finney's manliness, Professor Harper wrote in a memorial for the Alumni Weekly, \"was compounded of many elements: physical strength and vitality, intellectual vigor and versatil\u00ad ity, moral purity, social warmth, and loving-kindness.\" After reviewing Fin\u00ad ney's professional and civic achieve\u00ad ments and his many acts of self- sacrifice and charity, Harper con\u00ad cluded: \"We, his classmates, bow our hearts in thankfulness for a life so no\u00ad ble.\" Two of Finney's sons, John M.T. Finney, Jr. '15 and George G. Finney '21 became surgeons also. George Fin\u00ad ney and his son, Redmond CS. Finney '51 were trustees of Princeton, too. Finney Field, used for football and lacrosse, was given in his memory by his family in 1957. Fires have completely or partially de\u00ad stroyed campus buildings on six occa\u00ad sions: Nassau Hall in 1802 and 1855; Marquand Chapel and Dickinson Hall in 1920; John C. Green School of Sci\u00ad ence in 1928; University Gymnasium in 1944; and Whig Hall in 1969. NASSAU HALL FIRES The fire of 1802 started about one o'clock on the windy afternoon of Satur\u00ad day, March 6, and in two hours only the blackened walls of Nassau Hall were left standing. President Smith declared the fire the result of vice and irreligion, and a trustee's investi\u00ad gating committee thought it was begun intentionally. George Strawbridge 1802 (later a supreme court judge in Louisiana) made an independent in\u00ad vestigation and concluded that no stu\u00ad dent was in any way guilty; he thought sooty chimneys probably responsible. The trustees made a public appeal for funds to rebuild Nassau Hall and in less than a year it was again ready for use. The 1855 fire also occurred on a windy Saturday in March (the 10th). It started about eight o'clock in the eve\u00ad ning and by midnight, once again, only the walls were left standing. This time there was no suspicion of incendiarism. Many students suffered large losses of clothing and furniture, but the Latin professor, George M. Giger, with the help of some tutors and students, res\u00ad cued Peale's portrait of Washington and other valuable paintings from the por\u00ad trait gallery. \"Little Giger performed prodigies of valor,\" Alfred A. Woodhull 1856 wrote his mother, \"and several times was so excited that he came near having a fight with the firemen.\" Presi\u00ad dent John Maclean braved the smoke 184 FIRES and flames to search for a student mis\u00ad takenly reported trapped in an upper story room. \"Johnny . . . got so nearly suffocated,\" Woodhull told his mother, \"that a party of students scarcely saved him.\" Nassau Hall was reopened for the lodging of students in August 1856, but the reconstruction was not completed until June 1860, when the trustees thanked God \"for . . . raising up liberal friends, who by their generous contri\u00ad butions, have enabled us to rebuild our burnt Edifice, and to enlarge and im\u00ad prove it.\" One of the most \"liberal friends\" was President Maclean him\u00ad self, who helped liquidate the unpaid balance of the rebuilding cost by giv\u00ad ing up part of his salary. FIRES IN THE TWENTIES On Friday, May 14, 1920, a fire broke out in the original Dickinson Hall, which stood on the southwest corner of the present site of Firestone Library, and spread southward to Mar- quand Chapel, which stood just north\u00ad east of Murray-Dodge Hall. Dickinson and Marquand were completely de\u00ad stroyed, but the Joseph Henry House, which at that time stood between them, escaped with little damage. Volunteer firemen, helped by students in evening clothes\u2014the eating clubs were holding their house parties and there was a freshman dance at the gymnasium\u2014 and by an engine company from Tren\u00ad ton, kept the fire from spreading to McCosh Hall, Prospect, and Palmer Laboratory. Marquand Chapel was re\u00ad placed by the University Chapel in 1928 and the present Dickinson Hall was built in 1930. The fire that demolished the John C. Green School of Science was discov\u00ad ered a little before midnight on Mon\u00ad day, November 16, 1928. The tower was already in flames when the firemen arrived; by 4 a.m. the last of the roof had caved in and by daybreak the build\u00ad ing was a smouldering mass. The Joseph Henry House, which had been moved to a new location just north of the School of Science (to make way for the University Chapel) again escaped unscathed. This fire created a shortage of laboratories and classrooms, which was not relieved until the completion of Frick Chemical Laboratory in 1929 and Dickinson Hall in 1930, but the loss of the School of Science, which the Daily Princetonian thought had been \"con\u00ad ceived under an evil architectural star,\" was generally unmourned. UNIVERSITY GYMNASIUM The University Gymnasium, built in 1903, was destroyed by fire the morn\u00ad ing of May 13, 1944. The fire was dis\u00ad covered and an alarm turned in at 2:47 a.m. by naval watches in Little and Pat- ton Halls where members of the navy V-12 unit were quartered. The building was completely gutted and all its con\u00ad tents lost, since the dense smoke made it impossible for anyone to enter a door. Lost in the flames was Dr. Joseph E. Raycroft's library of some 2,500 vol\u00ad umes on health, sports, and physical education (partly restored later by gifts from friends), and scores of athletic trophies and relics, including a ball from the first Yale-Princeton football game of 1873. Heroic work by firemen and the University's grounds and build\u00ad ings forces kept the fire from spreading to adjoining dormitories. The Univer\u00ad sity Gymnasium was replaced by Dillon Gymnasium, completed soon after the end of the war. WHIG HALL FIRE The Whig Hall fire on Sunday, No\u00ad vember 9, 1969, was discovered by a University proctor at 5:45 a.m. and was brought under control by firemen by FRANCIS SCOTT KEY FITZGERALD 185 7:30 a.m. All but one of the exterior marble walls remained intact, but eighty percent of the wooden interior was destroyed, although most of the historic portraits of the American Whig-Cliosophic Society escaped dam\u00ad age. Renovations were completed in 1972. No loss of life resulted from any of these fires; the only serious injury was a broken leg incurred by a spectator from Kingston in the Nassau Hall fire of 1855. Firestone Plaza was given in memory of Roger S. Firestone '35, an inscription on one of its flagstones says, \"For The Enjoyment Of All Who Pause Here Or Pass This Way.\" Designed by the Uni\u00ad versity's consulting landscape architect, Robert L. Zion, the plaza's widened bluestone walkways, limestone benches and sitting steps, trees, shrubs, and ground cover draw together the much frequented campus area enclosed by Firestone Library, the University Chapel, Chancellor Green Student Center, and East Pyne Building. The plaza was constructed in 1976-1977 with funds contributed by Roger Fire\u00ad stone's widow, Anne Firestone, and his friend, charter trustee Laurance S. Rockefeller '32. Roger Firestone was the youngest of Harvey Firestone Sr.'s five Princeton sons, the principal donors of the library that bears his name. Fitzgerald, Francis Scott Key (1896- 1940) was a star-spangled Princetonian of the Class of 1917. The poet Robert Browning once wrote that the legend inside his heart was \"Italy.\" With Fitzgerald it would probably have been \"Princeton.\" He entered this earthly paradise in the fall of 1913 from the Catholic Newman School in Hacken- sack, squeaking past his entrance examinations that September by the narrowest margin, and hurling himself into extracurricular activities with so much enthusiasm that he barely sur\u00ad vived his first two years. After three months as a junior, he withdrew because of ill health and poor grades. Following nine months of rusti\u00ad cation and recuperation at home in St. Paul, Minnesota, he re-entered as a beginning junior in the fall of 1916. He managed to complete that academic year and one month of his senior year before withdrawing again to enter Officers' Training in October 1917. The fact that he was never graduated failed to expunge and indeed probably en\u00ad hanced his golden memories of Prince\u00ad ton, Cottage Club, Princeton football, the Triangle Club, The Nassau Lit, and the Tiger, to say nothing of the look and feel of Prospect Street in all seasons, and the mossy spires and gargoyles of the neo-Gothic campus. Apart from Princeton, two great forces guided his tragically abbreviated life. One was writing, which enthralled him in childhood, took up many college hours, supported and harassed him in maturity, and continued to engage his devotion until his dying day. The other was his romance with Zelda Sayre, a southern belle from Montgomery, Ala\u00ad bama, whom he coveted, courted, and at last married, sharing with her a char\u00ad acteristically hectic life in America and Europe during their great heyday of the 1920s. It was a manner of life that his chief biographer, Arthur Mizener has called \"at once representative and dramatic, at moments a charmed and beautiful success to which he and Zelda were brilliantly equal, and at moments disastrous beyond the invention of the most macabre imagination.\" Tiiis Side of Paradise, which Scrib-186 FRANCIS SCOTT KEY FITZGERALD ner's published March 26, 1920, and advertised in the Daily Princetonian as a \"Story about a Princeton Man,\" shows Fitzgerald making all he could of his years at Princeton. Dean Gauss once wrote of Fitzgerald that he had \"a truly Apollonian profile like the head on some Greek medallion.\" The same might have been written of Amory Blaine, Fitzgerald's handsome and in\u00ad souciant hero, who invents his way through various love affairs and much bad poetry and indulges his awakening brain with high intellectual bull ses\u00ad sions. However banal the novel may seem today, it set Fitzgerald off and running, and he became a regular con\u00ad tributor of short stories to The Smart Set, The Saturday Evening Post, and Scribner's Magazine. Selections from these appeared in Flappers and Philos\u00ad ophers and Tales of the Jazz Age, which helped to stamp Fitzgerald forever as a chief spokesman for the roaring twen\u00ad ties, while his second novel, The Beau\u00ad tiful and the Damned, accurately sum\u00ad marized in its title if not in its substance the present and future course of his life with Zelda. There was also a satirical play, The Vegetable: or From President to Postman, published in 1923. Two further short-story collections, All the Sad Young Men and Taps at Reveille, appeared in 1926 and 1935. Fitzgerald's best work in fiction owed little or nothing to Princeton. The Great Gatsby (1925), generally regarded as his finest novel, eschewed the Princeton scene in favor of Long Island and New York City. Tender is the Night (1934) borrowed its title from Keats and its locale and characters from Fitzgerald's experiences on the French Riviera in the middle 1920s. Behind the stories of Gatsby's longing for Daisy Buchanan and Dick Driver's for the beautiful Nicole, one can discern some of the tragic implications of Fitzgerald's love for Zelda, the gradual advance of whose mental illness darkened the last years of their marriage. From time to time he overcame his overdrinking and worked with some success as film- writer in Hollywood, where he gath\u00ad ered the material for his final though unfinished novel, The Last Tycoon. This was posthumously published in 1941 under the editorship of Edmund Wilson '16, with whom Fitzgerald had collaborated on \"The Evil Eye\" for the Triangle Club twenty-five years earlier, and whom he always revered as his \"in\u00ad tellectual conscience.\" Besides Wilson, the best critics of Fitzgerald's work have nearly all been Princetonians, with biographies by Arthur Mizener '30, and Andrew Turnbull '42, and critical studies by Henry Dan Piper '39, and Robert Sklar '58. Turnbull also edited a volume of Fitzgerald's letters. The eternal note of promise which everyone found in Fitzgerald's early work was well summarized by his classmate, John Peale Bishop 17, in a requiem called \"The Hours.\" No promise such as yours when like the spring You came, colors of jonquils in your hair, Inspired as the wind, when woods are bare and every silence is about to sing. The tragic circumstances of his life, and they were many, did not prevent his partial fulfillment of that promise be\u00ad cause his heart was always in his best writing. Although he sometimes ut\u00ad tered harsh words about his Alma Ma\u00ad ter, its image stayed undimmed until the end. When his heart ceased to beat, indeed at the very moment of his death far away in the city of Hollywood, he was scribbling notes in the margin of THE FITZRANDOLPH OBSERVATORY 187 his copy of the Alumni Weekly beside an article about the Princeton football team. The Manuscripts Division of the Li\u00ad brary contains Fitzgerald's papers, which were given to the University by his daughter Mrs. C. Grove Smith in 1946. Carlos Baker FitzRandolph Gateway, The, main en\u00ad trance to the Campus from Nassau Street, was erected in 1905, from the design of McKim, Mead and White, in fulfillment of a bequest from Augustus van Winkle, of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, in memory of his ancestor, Nathaniel FitzRandolph, who gave the land on which Nassau Hall was built. FitzRandolph was the son of one of the original seventeenth-century Quaker settlers of Princeton. More than any other citizen of Princeton, he was responsible for raising for the Col\u00ad lege the money and land the trustees required of the citizens of the place where it was to be located\u2014\u00a3 1000 New Jersey money, ten acres of cleared land for the campus, and 200 acres of wood\u00ad land for fuel\u2014and thus enabled Prince\u00ad ton to win from its chief competitor, New Brunswick, the honor and benefits of providing the site of the college. Besides riding among his neighbors to solicit donations, FitzRandolph him\u00ad self gave twenty pounds and 4\u00bd acres, described in the trustee minutes as \"a certain tract of land four hundred feet front and thirty poles [rods] depth, in line at right angles with the broad \"street where it is proposed that the col\u00ad lege shall be built.\" FitzRandolph took great interest in the building of the college and re\u00ad corded its progress in his journal: July 29, 1754, \"Jos. Morrow set a man first to dig the college cellar.\" September 17, 1754, \"the first cornerstone . . . was laid in northwesterly corner of the cellar by . . . Mr. William Worth, the mason that built the stone and brick work, myself, and many others.\" No\u00ad vember 1755, \"the roof. . . was raised by Robert Smith, the carpenter that built the timber work.\" November 13, 1756, \"Aaron Burr, President, preached the first sermon and began the school in Princeton College.\" FitzRandolph was buried in the fam\u00ad ily burial ground, which was located where Holder Hall now stands. Work\u00ad men excavating for the foundations of that dormitory in 1909 discovered thirty-two old, unmarked graves there. At President Wilson's direction the contents of the graves were preserved in separate boxes and reinterred under the eastern arch of Holder Hall and a memorial tablet placed in the arch. President Wilson wrote the English and Dean West the Latin for the in\u00ad scription: NEAR THIS SPOT LIE THE REMAINS OF NATHANIEL FITZRANDOLPH THE GENEROUS GIVER OF THE LAND UPON WHICH THE ORIGINAL BUILDINGS OF THIS UNIVERSITY WERE ERECTED In Agro Jacet Nostro Immo Suo (In our ground he sleeps, nay, rather, in his own.) FitzRandolph Observatory, The, on FitzRandolph Road, east of Palmer Stadium, replaced in 1934 the old HaI- sted Observatory, in use for sixty years on University Place where Joline Hall now stands. The Observatory contains a 36-inch reflecting telescope installed in 1966 to supersede a 23-inch refracting telescope used since 1882. 188 FOOTBALL Football was first played at Princeton on crisp fall afternoons in the 1840s when students gathered behind Nassau Hall for impromptu games. Opposing teams were made up of residents of East and West Colleges or members of the Whig and Clio Halls; sometimes, all the A to Ls were pitted against the M to Z's. After the Civil War, increasing interest led to interclass matches and eventually to an epochal event\u2014the first American intercollegiate football game, between Princeton and Rutgers, in New Brunswick on November 6, 1869. The twenty-five players from each college played in their street clothes, and the several hundred spectators stood around on the side or sat on a wooden fence. There were no coaches, no officials, no programs\u2014the Rutgers Targum, on which we chiefly depend for the record of the game, tells us that Princeton's first goal was made \"by a well directed kick, from a gentleman whose name we don't know, but who did the best kicking on the Princeton side.\" The Targum is equally silent about the identity of the first wrongway player in American football history, a Rutgers man \"who, in his ardor, forgot which way he was kicking,\" and scored for Princeton instead of Rutgers. By agreement, the home team's style of play was used, and Rutgers won, 6 goals to 4; a week later, Princeton won the return match on its grounds, 8 goals toO. The game that Princeton and Rutgers played was a form of association foot\u00ad ball, forerunner of later-day soccer, as was the game that Princeton and Yale played in 1873 (Princeton 3, Yale 0) in a match that inaugurated the longest continuous rivalry in American inter\u00ad collegiate football. Harvard, meantime, had been playing the \"Boston game,\" which was more like rugby, and in 1875 Harvard beat Yale, 4 to 0, in a rugby- type match, inaugurating this series. At this game, two spectators from Prince\u00ad ton, Jotham Potter 1877 and Earl Dodge 1879, were so taken with rugby that they resolved to press for its adop\u00ad tion at Princeton. Despite strong sen\u00ad timent for retaining association foot\u00ad ball\u2014\"rather less rowdyish and more scientific\" than the Harvard game, said the Nassau Lit\u2014Potter's and Dodge's views prevailed by a narrow margin at a spirited mass meeting. Subsequently, on Princeton's initiative, Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, and Yale repre\u00ad sentatives met on November 23, 1876, and formed the Intercollegiate Foot\u00ad ball Association, which adopted mod\u00ad ified rugby rules. Princeton's success, which had been marked in association football, declined temporarily with the change to rugby, but by 1878, when Woodrow Wilson and his classmate, Earl Dodge, were directors of the student-managed Princeton College Football Association, Princeton won all six of its games, de\u00ad feating both Harvard and Yale in the same season for the first time. American football, as it evolved from rugby, became so rough in its early years that after watching a Harvard- Yale match, bare-knuckle heavyweight boxing champion John L. Sullivan de\u00ad clared, \"There's murder in that game.\" Princeton contributed its share of roughness with its invention of the \"V- formation wedge,\" which compared fa\u00ad vorably with other engines as Harvard's \"flying wedge\" and Yale's \"tackles back\" formation. There were repeated efforts at reform, but re\u00ad lief from the continuing hazards of foot\u00ad ball came only in 1906, when, in re\u00ad sponse to public outcry, the game was opened up with legalization of the for\u00ad ward pass and other rule changes de\u00ad signed to reduce injuries. FOOTBALL 189 THE 1880s Princeton excelled in kicking throughout the 1880s. In the 1882 Yale game, John T. Haxall 1883 place-kicked a 65-yard goal, setting an intercol\u00ad legiate record that the outstanding col\u00ad lege kickers of subsequent years found hard to equal. In the second half of the 1883 Harvard game, the home-grown Princeton captain Alec Moffat 1884 (son of a professor of Greek) kicked two field goals with his right foot and two with his left, thus accounting for 20 points in Princeton's 26-7 victory. Mof\u00ad fat is credited with inventing the spiral punt, further developed by \"Snake\" Ames 1890, another superb kicker and a slippery open field runner. The teams of 1885 and 1889 won all their games. The 1885 team scored 637 points and allowed its nine opponents only 25\u2014a Princeton record, which by now must be considered indestructible. After winning its other games by an av\u00ad erage margin of 75 points, it came from behind in its last game to edge out Yale, 6 to 5, with the famous run of Tillie Lamar 1886. In the closing minutes a Yale punt bounced off the shoulder of another player into the outstretched hands of Lamar who, catching the ball on the run, streaked 90 yards for a touchdown. A tower of strength on both the 1885 and 1889 teams was Hector Cowan, who played tackle for five years, the last two as a Seminary student. In the vari\u00ad ous \"all-time\" teams in vogue up to World War II, Cowan was mentioned more frequently than any other Princetonian. THE 1890s The 1893 team, which also had a per\u00ad fect record, was remarkable for its strong defense\u2014and for its spirit of thankfulness. Standing \"naked and covered with mud and blood and per\u00ad spiration\" in the dressing room after their climactic 6 to 0 triumph over Yale (Richard Harding Davis reported in Harper's Weekly), the victorious Princeton players sang \"Praise God From Whom All Blessings Flow. ...\" The 1896 team marred an otherwise perfect record by incurring a scoreless tie with a strong Lafayette team, but was, nevertheless, considered Prince\u00ad ton's best team up to then, overwhelm\u00ad ing teams like Penn State and Cornell and defeating Harvard, 12 to 0, and Yale, 24 to 6. This was the last year that Harvard and Princeton met until 1911. In 1898, Princeton missed a perfect record by the same narrow margin as in 1896, suffering a 5 to 5 tie with Army, the only team it did not hold scoreless. Arthur Poe won a 7 to 0 victory over Yale by snatching the ball from an op\u00ad ponent's arms and dashing the length of the field for a touchdown. The next year he clinched an 11 to 10 victory over Yale by kicking a last-minute field goal, the only one he had ever at\u00ad tempted. His were the most memora\u00ad ble of many exploits of six brothers who played for Princeton from 1882 to 1902 (see Poe Brothers). VERSATILE JOHN DEWITT The 1903 team, undefeated and un\u00ad tied, scored 159 points against its eleven opponents, giving up only 6\u2014all to Yale. Its captain, John DeWitt 04, a big fast guard, was probably Princeton's most complete player in the pre-for- ward-pass era. He could block, tackle, run with the ball, punt, drop-kick, and place-kick equally well. He used his talents most strikingly in the last game of his career, when Princeton gave Yale its first defeat in two years. Yale scored its six points (five with a 190 FOOTBALL touchdown and one with a kick) early in the game. Toward the end of the first half a Yale drop-kick was blocked, and DeWitt scooped up the ball and ran 75 yards for a touchdown; Roy Vetterlein 06, the Princeton quarterback, kicked the extra point, tying the score. With only a minute left to play in the game, DeWitt kicked a 43-yard field goal (then worth five points) from a difficult angle, for the winning score. That Monday morning, placards all over the campus jubilantly announced: John DeWitt 11, Yale 6. In the formal picture of his team, broad-framed Captain John DeWitt is clad in a white sweater with a black P\u2014the best that a Nassau Street store could produce in his size, at a moment's notice, to replace the soiled and torn jersey he had brought with him to the photographers studio. DeWitt's make\u00ad shift attire later became standard garb for captains of Princeton championship teams. SAN WHITE'S RUNS From 1903 until the outbreak of the First World War, Princeton was eclipsed by Yale, and then by Harvard, except for two seasons. In 1906 strong Princeton and Yale teams had perfect records until their last game, when they held each other to a scoreless tie. The Princeton captain that year was Herbert L. Dillon 07, later the princi\u00ad pal donor to the gymnasium that bears his name. In 1911 Sanford White, at end, scored all the points that brought Princeton its first Big Three title since 1896. Against Harvard he recovered a blocked drop-kick and ran 90 yards for a touchdown, \"without a hand being laid on him,\" the Alumni Weekly reported. Later he tackled a Harvard back behind his own goal line for a safety, adding the two points needed to win, 8 to 6. Two weeks later, on a field of mud, he picked up a Yale fumble at mid-field and raced goalward. The Yale safety caught him at the four-yard line, but White struggled across the goal line, with the Yale defender holding on, for the winning score of 6 to 3. Less spectacular, but equally impor\u00ad tant, was the all-round play at tackle of Eddie Hart, captain in 1910 and 1911. One of the most powerful linemen who ever played for Princeton, he be\u00ad came a legend in the American Expedi\u00ad tionary Force during the First World War when, responding to an offer by a professional strong man in a Paris theatre to take on anyone in the audi\u00ad ence, Hart, on orders from his colonel, went forward to the stage and threw the challenger into the wings. In 1911, just before Hart's team was photographed, someone doing research on the rights and privileges of cham\u00ad pions discovered John DeWitt in his white sweater. A similar sweater was made ready for Eddie Hart, thus transmuting the 1903 improvisation into tradition. In 1912 Hobey Baker '14 scored 92 points, an individual Princeton season record for more than sixty years. THE ROPER ERA Bill Roper '02, who coached both the Dillon and the Hart teams, was head coach from 1919 through 1930. He was a great orator and a classic example of the inspirational coach. \"Hell,\" one of his opposing coaches complained, \"He's not a coach; he's an evangelist.\" Roper's 1919 and 1920 teams tied Harvard and beat Yale; his 1922, 1925, and 1926 teams were Big Three cham\u00ad pions. The 1920 team, captained by Mike Callahan, center, scored a deci\u00ad sive 20 to 0 victory over a Yale team led by Mike's older brother Tim, an ail- American guard. FOOTBALL 191 Stan Keck, a big, fast, all-American tackle\u2014\"the ubiquitous Mr. Keck,\" one reporter called him\u2014was the lead\u00ad ing blocker in 1920 and 1921, and Don Lourie, an all-American quarterback, was the star of the attack. Lourie was ably assisted by Hank Garrity, Ralph Gilroy, and Jack Cleaves. Their exploits moved Frank and and Garrity, Cleaves and Gilroy. Gilroy and Cleaves and Lourie and Garrity, No hope for Harvard or Yale to get charity; Worthy a wager of all your destiny,\" as it came to be known, completed Princeton's first perfect season since 1903. This team had little offense (some of its plays were made up on the field), but its defense was invincible. In most of its key games, the narrow margins of victory were provided chiefly by Ken Smith '24's field goals and extra points. Its most thrilling victory was over heav\u00ad ily favored Chicago. Trailing 18 to 7 (Chicago had missed all three of its extra points), with only twelve minutes left in the last quarter, Princeton rallied to score two touchdowns, and Ken Smith kicked the extra points, making the score 21 to 18. Five minutes later, with only seconds to play, Princeton held Chicago on fourth down, inches from the goal line. During this game, a Princeton fan be\u00ad came so excited when Howdie Gray '23 grabbed a Chicago fumble and raced 43 yards for a touchdown that he whacked someone sitting in front of him with his rolled-up program. \"Watch out there!\" a man cried, \"that's my wife you just hit.\" \"Terribly sorry,\" the enthusiastic fan replied, \"that's my son who just made that run!\" \"Oh,\" said the hus\u00ad band, \"go ahead, hit her again.\" The 1925 and 1926 teams were led by Ed McMillan '26 at center and John Davis '27 at guard, expertly di\u00ad rected by Dan Caulkins '27 at quarter\u00ad back. 1925 Yale game, Jake Slagle '27, a triple-threat halfback, took the ball from punt formation, stiff- armed and side-stepped several tacklers and, behind alert and effective interference, swept 92 yards for a touchdown that was reminiscent of the one Tillie Lamar had scored forty years before. THE 1930s Al Wittmer '22 was coach in 1931, Fritz Crisler (later coach and director of athletics at Michigan) from 1932 to 1937, Tad Weiman from 1938 to 1942, and Harry Mahnken in 1943 and 1944. In 1932 the Class of 1936 freshman team won all of its games and held all of its opponents scoreless. In the three succeeding varsity years members of this class, together with some excellent players from neighboring classes, won 25 games and lost only one\u2014an upset by Yale, 7 to 0, in 1934. Teams cap\u00ad tained by Art Lane '34 and Pepper Constable '36 were undefeated and un\u00ad tied in 1933 and 1935. The 1933 team held seven of its opponents scoreless and gave up only 8 points to the other two. Donald G. Herring '07, who covered football for the Alumni Weekly, said the 1935 team was the best college 192 FOOTBALL team he had ever seen. It overpowered Harvard and Yale and then went on to overwhelm Dartmouth in the last game, played in a near blizzard and made further memorable by the pres\u00ad ence of a twelfth man in Dartmouth's line-up during of its goal-line stands\u2014a spectator in mufti, uncon\u00ad nected with Dartmouth, but with a consuming passion for the underdog. Princeton beat Yale in 1938, 1939, 1940, and 1941, at that time the longest string of Princeton victories in the his\u00ad tory of the series. High scorers in these years were Dave Allerdice '41, one of Princeton's greatest passers (in three years he gained 2,492 yards by passing and set half a dozen other re\u00ad cords), and Bob Peters '42, whose skill in running, passing, and kicking made him a powerful triple threat. THE CALDWELL YEARS Charlie Caldwell '25, a member of Roper's 1922 \"team of destiny\" and a coach at Williams for seventeen years, was head coach at Princeton from 1945 until his death in 1957. He developed a highly effective offense that added ele\u00ad ments of deception, associated with the more modern T formation, to the power blocking of traditional single- wing football. His teams won six successive Big Three championships, 1947 through 1952, bettering by two the previous re\u00ad cord set by Percy Haughton's Harvard teams, 1912 through 1915. Six captains, accordingly, wore white sweaters and lit victory bonfires at the Cannon: Dick West '45 (a war veteran who graduated in 1948), Ed Mead '49, George Sella '50, George Chandler's 9-0 records in 1950 and 1951\u2014Prince\u00ad ton's only consecutive pair of per\u00adfect seasons since the advent of full- length schedules in 1876. These teams contributed the major part of a winning streak of twenty-four games (1949- 1952), a Princeton record. Both were awarded the Lambert Trophy as East\u00ad ern champions, both beat Yale by large margins, 47 to 12 and 27 to 0, and against Harvard, both set records for that series: in 1950, for the highest score, 63 to 26, and in 1951, for the widest margin of victory, 54 to 13. Their narrowest victory, 13 to 7, over Dartmouth in 1950, was ground out in the wake of a hurricane, in torrential rain, with an 80-mile gale blowing through the open end of the stadium; while the offensive team was in the huddle, an official had to hold the ball on the line of scrimmage to keep it from blowing away. These years were replete with out\u00ad standing performances from players like Jack Davison, Homer Smith, George Chandler, Frank McPhee\u2014and Dick Kazmaier. Davison scored four touchdowns against Harvard in 1949, a record for that series equalled in 1952 by Smith, who in that game set a Princeton single-game rushing record of 273 yards. That year Smith also added to the Lamar-Slagle tradition with his exciting 93-yard touchdown run against Yale. Chandler, a great blocker and a fine signal-caller, was the key man of the 1950 team, according to Caldwell. McPhee blocked seven punts in 1951. Kazmaier ran, passed, and punted equally well. Only 5'11\" and 170 pounds, his strong point was innate skill, perfected by concentration and practice, rather than power. His passes and punts were distinguished by their accuracy, his runs by his change of pace and of direction. He was the only offen\u00ad sive first-stringer from 1950 not lost FOOTBALL 193 through graduation, and Caldwell at\u00ad tributed the 1951 perfect season to Kazmaier's effort to improve his own 1950 performance, which set an exam\u00ad ple for his teammates. His finest hour came in the fifth game of 1951 against strong, previously undefeated Cornell. He completed 15 of 17 passes for 236 yards, and carried for 124 yards, 49 in an explosive run from a double reverse. All told, he scored two touchdowns, passed for three more, and set up two others. The score was 53 to 15. In his senior year, Kazmaier gained 1,827 yards, rushing and passing, the best in the nation. His career total of\u00ad fense, 4,354 yards, has long been a Princeton three-year record, as has his 35 scoring passes. Kazmaier was a unanimous choice for ail-American in both his junior and senior years, and he was voted the Heisman Trophy as the player of the year in 1951 by the biggest margin in the seventeen-year history of the award. In 1950 Caldwell was voted coach of the year; in 1951 he stood fourth. Princeton was unofficial Ivy cham\u00ad pion in 1955. That year, Captain Royce Flippin '56 (later director of athletics) completed a four-year scoring cam\u00ad paign against Yale akin to John De- Witt's virtuoso performance half a cen\u00ad tury earlier. In Yale games his fresh\u00ad man and three varsity seasons Flippin ran for nine touchdowns and passed for two others, thus having a hand in eleven of the twelve touchdowns his teams scored against Yale. THE COLMAN YEARS Dick Colman, Caldwell's pupil at Williams, and for twenty years his as\u00ad sistant as line coach at Williams and Princeton, took over during Caldwell's last illness. From 1957 through 1968, he taught single-wing football with the same conviction as Caldwell and with similar results. His teams won 75 games and lost 33, matching the average (.694) that Caldwell's teams had com\u00ad piled during his twelve-year stew\u00ad ardship. Princeton won the Ivy cham\u00ad pionship in 1957 (the League's second year) and in 1964, and shared it in 1963 and 1966, and won the Big Three title in 1958, 1964, 1965, and 1966. Six cap\u00ad tains, consequently, wore white sweat\u00ad ers and presided and Walter Kozumbo '67. The 1957 team rose from the ashes (i.e., their loss to Yale) to win the Ivy championship by overwhelming previ\u00ad ously unbeaten but once tied Dart\u00ad mouth, 34 to 14, in a game, marked by another end-of-the-season snowstorm, and John Sapoch's play-calling and blocking, Bob Casciola's defensive play at tackle, and Dan Sachs's running and passing. The 1958 team won Princeton's first Big Three title since 1952; against Yale it rolled up the largest score (50-14) that Princeton had ever made in this series. The mid-sixties were golden years, brightened by Cosmo Charlie Gogolak's renowned place-kicking. The 1963 team shared the Ivy title with Dartmouth, missing sole possession by a single point in its 21-22 loss to that team. The 1964 team achieved Prince\u00ad ton's first perfect season (9-0) since 1951, and set an Ivy League single- game record, beating Penn 55 to 0. In 1965 the opposing teams in Princeton's annual encounter with Rutgers were captained by twin brothers, Peter Savidge for Rutgers, Paul for Prince-194 FOOTBALL ton. Poetic justice called for a tie game, but Charlie Gogolak's six field goals and two goals after touchdown led Princeton to a 32 to 6 victory. Gogolak ended his Princeton career that year, the possessor of six national collegiate kicking records; one was for 50 con\u00ad secutive goals after touchdown, six more than the previous record, set by his older brother Pete at Cornell. The Gogolak brothers were soccer-style placement kickers who came to this country with their family from Hungary during the revolt of 1956. Both later kicked for professional teams. The 1966 team tied Harvard and Dartmouth for the Ivy League cham\u00ad pionship and also won the Big Three ti\u00ad tle, as Larry Stupski '67 gave an approx\u00ad imate replay of Sam White's perform\u00ad ance in 1911. Stupski made two key tackles which led to the upset of unde\u00ad feated Harvard, 18 to 14. A week later, after Walter Kozumbo had blocked a punt with less than four minutes to play, Stupski grabbed the ball and ran 60 yards for the touchdown which beat Yale, 13 to 7\u2014the sixth successive vic\u00ad tory over the Elis, tying a record set in 1952. In 1967 fullback Ellis Moore scored five touchdowns against Harvard, set\u00ad ting an Ivy single-game record, later equalled by Ed Marinaro of Cornell. THE RECENT YEARS Dick Colman resigned at the end of the 1968 season to become director of athletics at Middlebury College. He was succeeded by Jake McCandless '51, who had understudied Dick Kazmaier in 1949 and 1950, and had assisted Colman, chiefly as backfield coach, since 1958. McCandless transformed the Princeton offense from single-wing to T-formation. His 1969 team tied Yale and Dartmouth for the Ivy League championship. Two of his players later played professional football: running back Hank Bjorkland '72 (who set a Princeton career rushing record of 2,362 yards) and defensive tackle Carl Barisich '73 (an all-East as well as all- Ivy player). McCandless resigned at the end of the 1972 season, and was succeeded by Bob Casciola '58, who had played tackle under Caldwell and Colman, and had coached at Princeton, Dartmouth, and the University of Con\u00ad necticut. Although Princeton's football for\u00ad tunes suffered a slump through the mid-seventies, autumn afternoons in Palmer Stadium were brightened peri\u00ad odically by fine individual perform\u00ad ances that brought new records and awards. In 1973, Bill Skinner '74 set a Princeton career record with 75 pass receptions, while offensive guard and captain Bill Cronin '74 and running back Walt Snickenberger '75 were named all-Ivy. His senior year, Snick\u00ad enberger also set a Princeton season scoring record of 16 touchdowns and received the Bushnell Award as Ivy League player of the year. The follow\u00ad ing year quarterback Ron Beible '76 led the Ivy League in yards gained by for\u00ad ward passing as well as in total offense, set Princeton season and career records for forward passes completed (123 and 293) and total yards gained by passing (1503 and 3662), and was one of thirty- three scholar-athletes awarded scholar\u00ad ships for graduate study by the N.C.A.A. That same year, wide re\u00ad ceiver Neil Chamberlin '76 set Prince\u00ad ton season and career records for passes caught (44, 78), and open-field runner Mike Carter '77 led the Ivy League in both kickoff and punt returns. Defen\u00ad sive tackle Ted Schiller '77 was named All-Ivy in 1975 and All-East in 1976. In the latter year, offensive guard Kevin FOOTBALL ALL-AMERICANS 195 Fox '77 was chosen as scholar-athlete by the National Football Foundation. At the end of the 1977 season, Cas- ciola was succeeded by Frank Navarro, previously head coach at Wabash Col\u00ad lege in Indiana. LIGHTWEIGHT FOOTBALL Princeton's 150-pound football teams generally gave a good account of them\u00ad selves in the Eastern Intercollegiate League after its founding in 1931. Their longest period of excellence came in the late thirties and early forties when, coached by Harry A. Mahnken, their hard blocking and tackling earned them the title \"The Fighting Fifties\" and en\u00ad abled them to win the championship five of the six years from 1937 through 1942. Some dozen years later, teams coached by Dick Vaughan enjoyed another spell of success, highlighted by the performance of the undefeated team of 1954, which won the league title by overwhelming Navy, champion the five preceding years. Under Coach Dan White '65, the mid-seventies saw another string of winning teams, most notably the 1975 eleven, which de\u00ad feated perennial league leaders Army and Navy on the way to a tie with Cor\u00ad nell for the championship. Football All-Americans, now a rare species at Princeton, were once quite numerous. Five were named to the ini\u00ad tial All-America team of 1889 and five again in 1893. In only two of the years prior to World War 1\u20141900 and 1909\u2014did Princeton fail to place a single player on the first team. There\u00ad after, with the spread of football hegemony to the West and South, Princeton's representation declined. Five Princetonians were named to the first team in the twenties, one in the thirties, four in the fifties, two in the sixties. The names on the following list are taken from the All-America selections made by Caspar Whitney for 1889- 1896, Walter Camp for 1897-1924, Grantland Rice for 1925-1953, the As\u00ad sociated Press since 1925, and United Press International since 1926; in re\u00ad cent years, additional names have been taken from the NCAA Consensus All- America teams. * All told, fifty Princetonians have been named first team All-American, three of them three times, ten twice :t 1889 K.

Forrestal Campus, a major University facility for research and instruction, was established in 1951 on a 825-acre tract, three miles southeast of the main cam\u00ad pus on U.S. Route 1. It was named for the first United States Secretary of De\u00ad fense, James Forrestal '15, who, while secretary of the navy, had initiated government support of fundamental re\u00ad search in science and engineering. The University purchased the land, with sixteen laboratory buildings, for $1,500,000 from the Rockefeller Insti\u00ad tute for Medical Research, which relo\u00ad cated its Princeton activities in New York as part of what became Rockefel\u00ad ler University. It was at the Institute that Nobel laureates Wendell M. Stan\u00ad ley and John H. Northrup made their discoveries about the essential nature of viruses. At first, Forrestal was devoted prin\u00ad cipally to research activities in aero\u00ad space and mechanical sciences. Added subsequently were three major re\u00ad search facilities: Project Matterhorn, later called the Plasma Physics Labora\u00ad tory (q.v.); the federal government's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Labora\u00adtory for theoretical research in me\u00ad teorology and oceanography, moved to Princeton from Washington, D.C. in 1968; and the $40 million Princeton- Pennsylvania Accelerator, which pro\u00ad vided unique research facilities for the study of elementary particles from 1957 until 1972 when, supporting funds being no longer available, it was closed and placed in stand-by condition. In 1973 the University announced a long-range plan to influence the quality of development in the area surrounding the Forrestal Campus and at the same time to generate long-term income for its own educational objectives. Called the Princeton Forrestal Center, the project involved adding enough acre\u00ad age to the original Forrestal Campus (both by purchase and the acquisition of developmental control) to bring the total area to 1,600 acres. Almost half of this land was to be retained for the For\u00ad restal Campus and for open space, leav\u00ad ing the rest to be developed for office, research, and light industrial use, and for town houses, apartments, a hotel, and a shopping area. Founding of Princeton, The, like that of Brown, Rutgers, and Dartmouth, was one of the consequences of The Great Awakening, the series of reli\u00ad gious revivals that swept the English colonies in America in the eighteenth century. The Great Awakening had other important social and political con\u00ad sequences, too. It brought an upsurge in missionary activities among the In\u00ad dians and the first important movement against slavery. Of special importance for Princeton, it increased opposition to the Anglican Church and the royal offi\u00ad cials who supported it, and created a democratic spirit in religion that was al\u00ad lied to the insistence on political home 198 THE FOUNDING OF PRINCETON rule that eventually brought independ\u00ad ence from Britain. The Great Awakening is said to have begun in New Jersey about 1720 with revival meetings in the Raritan Valley led by a Dutch Reformed pastor, Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen, who emphasized the religion of the heart over doctrine and liturgy. It was carried on throughout the Middle Col\u00ad onies under the leadership of zealous, evangelical graduates of the Log Col\u00ad lege (q.v.), founded in Pennsylvania about 1726 by Presbyterian William Tennent. In New England the move\u00ad ment was led by the stirring preaching of Congregationalist Jonathan Edwards at Northampton, Massachusetts. These and other revivalistic activities were stimulated in the years 1739 to 1741 by the tours of the English evangelist, George Whitefield. The activities spread with the preaching of Presbyte\u00ad rian Samuel Davies in Virginia and with later efforts of Baptists and Methodists in other parts of the South. * In New England, where the move\u00ad ment was shorter-lived than elsewhere, the emotional, and sometimes fanatical, excesses of some of the followers of the revivalists left a bitter division in the churches between the \"New Lights\" and the \"Old Lights.\" In the Middle Colonies a similar division between the \"New Sides\" and the \"Old Sides\" caused a split in the Presbyterian Church from 1741 to 1758 known as the Great Schism. ORIGIN OF THE COLLEGE The four originators of the College were members of the moderate wing of the New Sides. Three of them were graduates of Yale: Jonathan Dickinson, pastor at Elizabethtown; Aaron Burr, pastor at Newark; John Pierson, pastor at Woodbridge. The fourth, Ebenezer Pemberton, pastor of the Presbyterian Church in New York, was a graduate of Harvard. They believed in revivalism and welcomed George Whitefield to their pulpits, but they disapproved of the more contentious and intrusive methods of the New Sides graduates of William Tennent's Log College. Never\u00ad theless, being ex-Congregationalists, they defended the rights of the Ten\u00ad nent men in their disputes with the Old Sides group that dominated the Synod of Philadelphia. After this synod expel\u00ad led the Presbytery of New Brunswick in 1741 for defying a regulation that Log College graduates should not be ordained without an examination by a committee of the synod, Dickinson, Burr, and the others tried in vain to ef\u00ad fect a conciliation. They then withdrew from the Synod of Philadelphia and joined with the Presbytery of New Brunswick to form the new Synod of New York in 1745. Disappointed by Yale and Harvard's opposition to the Great Awakening and not satisfied with the limited course of instruction given at the Log College, they devised a plan for the establish\u00ad ment of a new college. The four minis\u00ad ters persuaded three leading lay Pres\u00ad byterians in New York to join them. These three, also graduates of Yale were: William Smith, lawyer; Peter Van Brugh Livingston, merchant; and William Peartree Smith, a young man of independent means who was a generous supporter of the church and \"an ardent patriot.\" Since there was at that time no college in existence be\u00ad tween New Haven in Connecticut and Williamsburg in Virginia\u2014a long dis\u00ad tance to cover by horseback or stage\u00ad coach\u2014the need for an institution of higher education in the Middle Col\u00ad onies, they felt, was urgent. Late in 1745 or early in 1746 these THE FOUNDING OF PRINCETON seven men applied for a charter to Governor Lewis Morris, an Anglican, who refused their petition because, he said, his instructions inhibited him from granting such a charter to a group of dissenters. Following Morris's death, they applied anew to Acting Governor John Hamilton. Although also an Angli\u00ad can, Hamilton was more liberal in his views than Morris and with the consent of his Council, on which there were a number of friends of the proposed Col\u00ad lege, he granted a charter on October 22, 1746. The Anglican clergy later complained that it was done \"so sud\u00ad denly and privately\" that they \"had no opportunity to enter a caveat against it.\" A century and a half later the Angli\u00ad can Acting Governor received this trib\u00ad ute from a latter-day Presbyterian, John DeWitt 1861, in a history of the College that he wrote for the Ses- quicentennial Celebration: The name of John Hamilton should be given a conspicuous place in any list of the founders of Princeton Uni\u00ad versity. He granted the first charter; he granted it against the precedent made by the governor whom he suc\u00ad ceeded in the executive chair; and he granted it with alacrity. . . . What is more remarkable, at a time when Episcopalian governors were ill- disposed to grant to Presbyterians ecclesiastical or educational franchis\u00ad es, he\u2014an Episcopalian\u2014gave this charter to a board of trust composed wholly of members of the Presbyte\u00ad rian Church. . . . However, the college thus founded was not, as has sometimes been said, established under the auspices of the Synod of New York. The seven persons who, in the words of their leader Jonathan Dickinson (q.v.), \"first con-199 cocted the plan and foundation of the College\" were leading members of that body, but they acted independently as (the charter said) \"well disposed & pub- lick spirited Persons.\" The new institu\u00ad tion, therefore, was not to be a synodi- cal seminary of the kind that had been planned earlier by the Synod of Phila\u00ad delphia, but a college of liberal arts and sciences. \"Though our great Intention was to erect a seminary for educating Ministers of the Gospel,\" one of the founders+ later wrote in a letter to another clergyman, \"yet we hope it will be useful in other learned professions \u2014Ornaments of the State as well as the Church. Therefore we propose to make the plan of Education as extensive as our Circumstances will admit.\" The College, furthermore, was not to be solely for Presbyterians: \"The most effectual Care is taken in our Charter to secure the Rights of Conscience,\" the Trustee wrote in this same letter. \"Per\u00ad sons of all persuasions are to have free access to the Honours & Privileges of the College, while they behave them\u00ad selves with Sobriety and Virtue.\" Five months or more after they ob\u00ad tained the charter, the seven original trustees chose for the remaining places they were empowered to fill five ardent New Siders: Samuel Rlair, Samuel Fin- ley, Gilbert Tennent, William Ten- nent, Jr., and Richard Treat, all graduates of the Log College except Treat, who was one of its close adher\u00ad ents. On April 27, 1747, the trustees announced the election of Jonathan Dickinson as president, and the Col\u00ad lege opened in his Elizabethtown par\u00ad sonage during the last week of May. On President Dickinson's death the following October, the College moved to the Newark parsonage of Aaron Burr, who was elected the second pres\u00ad ident. 200 PHILIP FRENEAU THE FOUNDING PERFECTED When the first charter was attacked \u2014the Anglicans contended that Hamil\u00ad ton was superannuated when he granted it and threatened to test its va\u00ad lidity in court\u2014the next governor, Jonathan Belcher (q.v.), a graduate of Harvard and a Congregationalist, is\u00ad sued a second one on September 14, 1748. It left intact the essential features of the first charter, but developed fur\u00ad ther the founders' concern for \"State as well as Church\" by making the gover\u00ad nor of New Jersey ex-officio a trustee and including among those appointed to an enlarged board of twenty-three trustees, four members of the Provin\u00ad cial Council and other prominent laymen, two of whom were members of the Society of Friends, two of the Epis\u00ad copal Church, and one of the Dutch Re\u00ad formed Church. Belcher's efforts on behalf of the Col\u00ad lege tended to eclipse the work of the earlier founders. Although he himself referred to the College as his \"adopted daughter,\" the trustees, in proposing to name the first college building in Princeton for him, said they viewed him as the College's \"founder, patron, and benefactor.\" An Account of the College, published by the trustees in 1764, even begins with the granting of the charter by Governor Belcher and the opening of the College in Newark under \"Mr. President Burr, the first who officiated in that station.\" Later historians\u2014President Mac\u00ad lean, Professors Collins and Werten- baker\u2014have, with ample documenta\u00ad tion, restored the earlier phases of Princeton's founding, President Mac\u00ad lean giving us this balanced view of Belcher's role: The Governor was not, properly speaking, the founder of the College, in the sense of being its originator, for the College was in existence, and in active operation, before his ar\u00ad rival. He was not, therefore, to use a phrase of Lord Coke's, its Fundator lncipiens, although, in view of what he did towards the building up of the institution, he may be regarded as its Fundator Perficiens. * Frelinghuysen received an honorary degree from Princeton in 1749, Davies in 1753, Whitefield in 1754. Two of William Tennent's sons became Trustees of the College, Edwards, its third president, Davies, its fourth. t The letter, when given to the University in 1905, lacked the last page(s). Internal evidence suggests that it was written between 1748 and 1750, probably by Ebenezer Pemberton. Freneau, Philip [Morin] (1752-1832) fulfilled the dream of his wine mer\u00ad chant father, Pierre Fresneau (old spelling) when he entered the Class of 1771 to prepare for the ministry. Well versed in the classics in Monmouth County under the tutelage of William Tennent, Philip entered Princeton as a sophomore in 1768, but the joy of the occasion was marred by his father's financial losses and death the year be\u00ad fore. In spite of financial hardships, Philip's Scottish mother believed that her oldest of five children would graduate and join the clergy. Though he was a serious student of theology and a stern moralist all his life, Freneau found his true calling in literature. As his roommate and close friend James Madison (q.v.) recognized early, Fre- neau's wit and verbal skills would make him a powerful wielder of the pen and a formidable adversary on the battlefields of print. Freneau soon became the un\u00ad rivaled \"poet of the Revolution\" and is still widely regarded as the \"Father of American Literature.\" Although Freneau had produced PHILIP FRENEAU 201 several accomplished private poems be\u00ad fore college, it was the intense experi\u00ad ence of pre-Revolutionary-War Prince\u00ad ton that turned the poet's interest to public writing. Political concerns led Madison, Freneau, and their friends Hugh Henry Brackenridge (q.v.) and William Bradford, Jr., to revive the defunct Plain Dealing Club as the American Whig Society. Their verbal skirmishes with the conservative Cliosophic Society provided ample op\u00ad portunities for sharpening Freneau's skills in prose and poetic satire. Charged with literary and political en\u00ad thusiasm, Freneau and Brackenridge collaborated on a rollicking, picaresque narrative, Father Bombo's Pilgrimage to Mecca in Arabia, which presents comic glimpses of life in eighteenth- century America. This piece, recently acquired by Princeton and published by the University Library (1975), may well be the first work of prose fiction written in America. During their senior year Freneau and Brackenridge labored long on another joint project to which Freneau contributed the greater share. Their composition was a patriotic poem of epic design, \"The Rising Glory of America,\" a prophecy of a time when a united nation should rule the vast con\u00ad tinent from the Atlantic to the Pacific. At the commencement exercises of September 1771, Brackenridge read this poem to a \"vast concourse of the politest company,\" gathered at Nassau Hall. The poem articulated the vision and fervor of a young revolutionary generation. Freneau's life after Princeton was one of change and conflict. He tried teaching and hated it. He spent two more years studying theology, but gave it up. He felt a deep obligation to per\u00ad form public service, and his satires against the British in 1775 were written out of fervent patriotism. At the same time he distrusted politics and had a personal yearning to escape social turmoil and war. The romantic private poet within him struggled against his public role. Thus, paradoxically, in 1776 the \"poet of the revolution\" set sail for the West Indies where he spent two years writing of the beauties of na\u00ad ture and learning navigation. Suddenly in 1778, he returned to New Jersey and joined the militia and sailed the Atlan\u00ad tic as a ship captain. After suffering for six weeks on a British prison ship, he poured his bitterness into his political writing and into much of his volumi\u00ad nous poetry of the early 1780s. By 1790, at the age of thirty-eight, with two collections of poetry in print and a reputation as a fiery propagandist and skillful sea captain, Freneau de\u00ad cided to settle down. He married Eleanor Forman and tried to withdraw to a quiet job as an assistant editor in New York. But politics called again. His friends Madison and Jefferson per\u00ad suaded him to set up his own newspa\u00ad per in Philadelphia to counter the pow\u00ad erful Hamiltonian paper of John Fenno. Freneau's National Jef\u00ad ferson's \"Republican\" principles and even condemned Washington's foreign policy. Jefferson later praised Freneau for having \"saved our Constitution which was galloping fast into monar\u00ad chy,\" while Washington grumbled of \"that rascal Freneau\"\u2014an epithet that became the title of Lewis Leary's au\u00ad thoritative biography (1949). After another decade of feverish pub\u00ad lic action, Freneau withdrew again in 1801, when Jefferson was elected pres\u00ad ident. He retired to his farm and re\u00ad turned occasionally to the sea. During his last thirty years, he worked on his poems, wrote essays attacking the 202 FRICK CHEMICAL LABORATORY greed and selfishness of corrupt politi\u00ad cians, and sold pieces of his lands to produce a small income. He discovered that he had given his best years of liter\u00ad ary productivity to his country, for it had been in the few stolen moments of the hectic 1780s that he found the in\u00ad spiration for his best poems, such as \"The Indian Burying Ground\" and \"The Wild Honey Suckle,\" a beautiful lyric which established him as an im\u00ad portant American precursor of the Romantics. Most students of Freneau's life and writing agree that he could have pro\u00ad duced much more poetry of high liter\u00ad ary merit had he not expended so much energy and talent for his country's polit\u00ad ical goals. In a way, though, he had fulfilled his father's hopes for him, for he had devoted his life to public service as a guardian of the morals of his society and as a spokesman for the needs of its people. Emory B. Elliott, Jr. Frick Chemical Laboratory was built in 1929 and named for Pittsburgh steelmaker Henry Clay Frick. His in\u00ad terest in the University had been culti\u00ad vated originally by Dean West, who persuaded him to give the Graduate College the Procter Hall organ. In 1916 Frick expressed an interest in helping start a law school at Princeton, but agreed instead to give a chemical labo\u00ad ratory when President Hibben told him how urgently one was needed. Plans were drawn up, but Frick was appalled by the estimated cost of $1 million, which he thought due to inflated steel prices; the building was accordingly postponed. Frick died in 1919, leaving almost $6 million to Princeton for its unrestricted use. All of his benefaction was used for endowment of faculty salaries, then badly needed, and it was not until late in the twenties that funds for the new laboratory became available through the Princeton University Fund. When the laboratory was completed in 1929, at a cost of $1,840,000, the trustees, mindful of Frick's earlier interest and his subsequent bequest, voted to name it for him. Designed by Charles Z. Klauder, and constructed at the corner of Wash\u00ad ington Road and William Street, the three-story building contains under\u00ad graduate laboratories, lecture rooms, faculty offices, and many research labo\u00ad ratories. A new wing at the rear, de\u00ad signed by O'Connor and Kilham, was completed in 1964 at a cost of $2 mil\u00ad lion, doubling the space available for research. It was made possible by an anonymous $1 million gift, supple\u00ad mented by grants from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, and other gifts. A $3 million renovation program, com\u00ad pleted in 1975, brought substantial modernization. Funds for this purpose were contributed through the Universi\u00ad ty's $125 million development program by the Kresge Foundation, the Haas Community Fund, and other donors. On the second floor of the original building, above the entrance hall, is the chemistry library. Over a fireplace is inscribed a Latin version of a quotation from Ptolemy with which Dean Taylor (q.v.) ended his address at the dedica\u00ad tion of Frick in 1929: NON EST MORTWS QUI SCIENTIAM VIVIFICAVIT (He is not dead who has made knowledge live). Fund Raising. Only two years after the College of New Jersey was founded in 1746, a trustee remarked that \"the principal thing we now want is a proper fund to enable us to go on with this ex-FUND RAISING 203 pensive undertaking.\" Naturally a committee was formed and Princetons long history of fund-raising com\u00ad menced. In the beginning, subscriptions were sought from colonists in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. Lotteries were conducted in the College's behalf, and loyal sons returned to England for financial support and encouragement. The earliest fund-raisers, founding Trustee Gilbert Tennent and fourth president Samuel Davies, left the Col\u00ad lege in 1753 on a trip to Britain to ap\u00ad peal for support. A year-and-a-half later, with Davies nearly dead from seasickness, they returned home heart- tened by the generosity of their former countrymen who financed construction of the first college building. As stone upon stone was laid and the building began to take shape, the trustees asked \"to dignify the edifice now erecting at Princeton\" with the name of Jonathan Belcher, then the governor of New Jer\u00ad sey. But Mr. Belcher declined the honor (perhaps one of the nicest gifts anyone has given to the University!) and suggested the building be named Nassau Hall, as a memorial to King Wil\u00ad liam III, House of Nassau. Many subsequent forays to raise funds for specific purposes continued over the years. Left uneasy by these unrelated, ad hoc solicitations, Presi\u00ad dent Maclean established a permanent endowment fund in 1853. But the en\u00ad dowment grew slowly, and Princeton depended largely on annual gifts to meet its operating expenses. Today both current gifts and endowment in\u00ad come make major contributions to the operating budget, accounting for about a quarter of the income. From the very beginning, Princeton realized that her loyal, supportive alumni were her most important hope for continuing strength and suste\u00ad nance. Systematic annual appeals to the entire alumni body began in 1940 with Annual Giving. That year $80,000 was realized, a modest beginning for the well-organized drives that attracted more than $5 million by 1977. Comple\u00ad menting these campaigns, which raise unrestricted support for the University, are more specific, formal solicitations conducted by the Development Office, established in 1956 to attract funds for endowment, construction, student aid, and other needs. In 1959, the Office launched a $53 million campaign under President Go- heen. Thanks mainly to alumni generosity, that goal was soon ex\u00ad ceeded, and another development pro\u00ad gram, begun less than a decade later, raised $125 million for Princeton. Gifts from alumni (which by this time in\u00ad cluded women) were to remain the primary means of support; they were complemented by foundation, corpo\u00ad rate, and government assistance. As President Bowen has suggested, it is because of these diverse sources of support that Princeton is able to retain its independence. Although ultimate responsibility for fund-raising still falls on the president and trustees, volun\u00ad teer alumni advocates (headed by the Council for University Resources)\u2014 supported by a staff of 25 persons\u2014 coordinate the activities. Over the years gifts to the University have ranged from a first folio Shakes\u00ad peare to fellowships; from parcels of land\u2014such as the original four-and-a- half acre plot presented in 1753 for the site of the College by Nathaniel Fitz- Randolph, or the three-and-a-half mile long Lake Carnegie given by Andrew Carnegie in 1906\u2014to works of art. Memorials include some 100 endowed professorships and 700 scholarships. 204 ROBERT GARRETT Through Annual Giving Princeton is better able to support faculty salaries and purchase less glamorous yet essen\u00ad tial items such as light bulbs and lawn mowers. The spirit and loyalty of alumni and other friends through the centuries continue to give renewed life to the thought of President Dodds: \"We intend to be the progenitors of a stronger Princeton, not merely bene\u00ad ficiaries of generations that came be\u00ad fore us.\" Henry E. Bessire Garrett, Robert 1897 (1875-1961), once told his classmates that he had, \"in a manner of speaking,\" elected himself to the Princeton Board of Trustees. In the winter of 1905, he said, he was in\u00ad vited to become a trustee of Johns Hopkins, in his native city of Balti\u00ad more, where he had once been a graduate student. Because of his regard for Princeton and \"his desire to serve her and her only,\" he asked the advice of President Wilson who unhesitatingly advised him to decline the Hopkins in\u00ad vitation. Garrett did so in February; in April he received an invitation from President Wilson to become a trustee of Princeton. Garrett took his seat on the board in June at the age of twenty- nine, and went on to serve the Univer\u00ad sity for forty years as charter trustee and for sixteen more as trustee emeritus. Garrett's father, Thomas Harrison Garrett, of the Class of 1868, died in 1888. While Robert Garrett and his two older brothers, Horatio W. Garrett 1895 and John W. Garrett 1895, were in college their mother lived at 1 Bayard Lane in the house later occupied by the family of Edgar Palmer '03, and now used by the University, to whom it was bequeathed by Mrs. Palmer, as a guest house. Mrs. Garrett's home was a cen\u00ad ter of hospitality for students in the 1890s; they later erected a tablet in her memory in Alexander Hall. Robert Garrett excelled in track and field athletics as an undergraduate. He was captain of the team in both his junior and senior years. In 1896 he or\u00ad ganized and personally financed an ex\u00ad pedition of himself and three class\u00ad mates to Athens for the first modern revival of the ancient Olympic Games. Garrett stood out among the com\u00ad petitors from all nations, winning two first places and two second. One of his firsts was in the discus throw, in which he had never competed before. Another expedition, of greater ulti\u00ad mate consequence, which Garrett helped organize and finance was an ar\u00ad chaeological expedition to Syria, led by Howard Crosby Butler 1892 (q.v.) in 1899-1900. The interest engendered by this ex\u00ad pedition stimulated Garrett to start his collection of Near Eastern manuscripts, which grew with the years and which, when he gave it to the University in 1942, consisted of 10,000 titles in Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, as well as several thousand Western manuscripts. The Garrett Collection is one of the principal scholarly resources of the Department of Near Eastern Studies and was one of the factors that enabled Professors Harold H. Bender and Philip K. Hitti to create a department of unique distinction in this country. The Garrett Collection of Near Eastern Manuscripts is still without a peer in the United States. On his return from the archaeological expedition, Garrett entered the Balti\u00ad more investment banking firm of Robert Garrett & Sons, which had been founded by his great-grandfather and namesake, and in time he became CHRISTIAN GAUSS 205 chairman of the board. He also played a conspicuous part in the development of public recreational facilities, the Y.M.C.A., and arts museums in Balti\u00ad more. Garrett's contributions to Princeton as trustee included the creation of the office of Consulting Architect (originally suggested to him by Professor Howard Crosby Butler); the metamorphosis of the Committee on Morals and Disci\u00ad pline, which he thought \"dourly named,\" into the Committee on Morals and Physical Education, and its later division into two committees, one on Student Life, the other on Health and Athletics; the establishment of the De\u00ad partment of Health and Physical Edu\u00ad cation, bringing Dr. Joseph E. Raycroft here from Chicago as its first chair\u00ad man; and, finally, the nomination of his fellow townsman, Dr. John M. T. Fin\u00ad ney 1884 (q.v.), to membership on the Board. Garrett was president of the Class of 1897 for sixty-four years. He had two Princeton sons: Harrison Garrett '33 (alumni trustee 1964-1968) and Johnson Garrett '35. Gauss, Christian (1878-1951), one of Woodrow Wilson's original preceptors, first Class of 1900 professor of modern languages, and third dean of the col\u00ad lege, had, in Edmund Wilson's phrase, \"an imaginative gift of entering into other people's points of view.\" It was this quality that made him a great teacher ofliterature and an illuminating critic. It had much to do as well with his becoming, in his time, one of Prince\u00ad ton's most beloved figures and perhaps the best known college dean in America. Gauss was born and brought up in a community of South German immi\u00ad grants in Ann Arbor, Michigan, \"the lovely little town,\" in his words \"with the name like the title of a song.\" His father had come there from Wurttem- berg in the late 1860s to escape Prus\u00ad sian domination, and when he had saved enough money to buy a house, had chosen one on Liberty Street in\u00ad stead of a more desirable one on Main Street, so that all their lives \"his chil\u00ad dren would have the satisfaction of knowing that they had been born in die Freiheitsstrasse.\" Growing up in Ann Arbor, then a quiet village, Christian Gauss developed \"a deep sense of be\u00ad longing\" to his community, which stayed with him all his life. Gauss worked his way through the University of Michigan in three years. He had begun working after school early in life, and when he graduated from college at the age of twenty, he could already look back on a versatile career\u2014as baker's boy, grocery clerk, farm hand, drug clerk, bill collector, bank clerk, tutor, and barkeeper at county fairs. After college Gauss worked for a time as a newspaper correspondent in Paris (where he wrote about the Dreyfus case and talked in cafes with Oscar Wilde), taught at Michigan and at Lehigh, and was called to Princeton in 1905 as one of the youngest of the University's first preceptors. Two years later, at the age of twenty-nine, he was promoted to full professor. He became chairman of the Department of Modern Languages in 1912 and served until 1936. In 1925 he was appointed dean of the college and in 1929 was named first incumbent of a chair in modern languages endowed by his friends in the Class of 1900. He occupied both positions until his re\u00ad tirement in 1946. Along the way he also served as liter\u00ad ary editor of the Alumni Weekly, reor- ganizer and adviser of the Press Club, 206 CHRISTIAN GAUSS guide and friend of the Nassau Literary Magazine, trustee and vice president of Princeton University Press, chairman of the University Council on Athletics, and founder and first chairman of the Creative Arts Program (q.v.)\u00b7 He was made a Knight of the Legion of Honor by the French Republic and received honorary degrees from half a dozen universities. TEACHER OF LITERATURE Christian Gauss was a great teacher whose courses on Dante and on French writers of the Romantic Period pro\u00ad foundly influenced many Princeton students of literature in the first half of this century. His memory was remarkable, and he brimmed over with literary allusions. Two of his favorite quotations were Er\u00ad nest Renan's La verite est dans la nuance, which he translated: truth lies in fine distinctions,\" and Dos\u00ad toevski's \"We were all born on purpose to be together.\" The eminent federal judge Harold R. Medina 09 said it was Gauss who first taught him to think. \"He led and guided with so gentle a touch that one began to think almost despite oneself,\" Medina recalled. In a similar vein, Edmund Wilson '16, the literary critic, spoke of \"how the lightly dropped seeds from his lectures could take root and unfold in another's mind.\" Wilson also described the influence Gauss exerted on him, John Peale Rishop '17, F. Scott Fitzgerald '17, and other undergraduate writers for the Nassau Literary Magazine through the reading of Dante and Flaubert: \"He made us all want to write something in which every word, every cadence, every detail, should perform a definite function in producing an intense ef\u00ad fect.\" Gauss brought to his teaching a breadth of learning that was matched by a wide interest in the affairs of the world, both historical and contempo\u00ad rary. This quality was celebrated in a verse of the Faculty Song sung by the seniors in 1915: Here's to Gauss, called Chris-ti-an, A most encyclopedic man. He jokes and lectures, rhymes and teaches, And raves about the Kaiser's speeches. (This last line referred to Gauss's anti- Prussianism, inherited from his father, which led him to champion the Allied cause before the United States entered the First World War.) Wilson, who dedicated one of his books of literary criticism (Axel's Cas\u00ad tle, 1931) to his old Princeton teacher, thought Gauss himself a brilliant critic\u2014\"by far the best,\" so far as he knew, \"in our academic world of that period.\" \"Gauss's special understand\u00ad ing of the techniques of art,\" Wilson wrote, \"was combined, as is not always the case, with a highly developed sense of history, as well as a sense of moral- ity.\" Donald A. Stauffer '23, who while an undergraduate was Gauss's secretary, and was later chairman of the Depart\u00ad ment of English, described Gauss's es\u00ad sential quality as a teacher in this way: He had respect for mind wherever he found it. He supported alike the specialized research of scholars and the wildest outbursts of nineteen- year-old aesthetes. He was as good with grandchildren as with dig\u00ad nitaries. In the exchange of opinions, in the inquiry into values, he prac\u00ad ticed liberty, equality, and fraternity. CHRISTIAN GAUSS 207 DEAN OF THE COLLEGE The announcement of Gauss's ap\u00ad pointment as dean of the college in the spring of 1925 elicited a new verse in the Faculty Song: Oh, here's to Gauss, who knows his stuff, We liked him though his course was tough. But when he's Dean we shall delight In hating him with all our might. Though written with tongue in cheek, these words did suggest the dire possibilities of any deanship, and espe\u00ad cially one in an era plagued by Prohibi\u00ad tion, the Depression, and the Second World War, but in Gauss's case the op\u00ad posite came to pass. At the begin\u00ad ning, his determination that the eight\u00ad eenth amendment (which he publicly opposed) should be strictly enforced because it was the law, brought some resentment, but most undergraduates learned to respect the integrity of his position. There were riots, too, in the Prohibi\u00ad tion era, to which Gauss reacted vari\u00ad ously. One in the spring of 1926, which involved a good deal of noise and jos\u00ad tling and some jeering of volunteer fire\u00ad men, but no violence to any person or property, he played down when called by the newspapers. \"It was nothing but a Poler's Recess,\" he said, \"complicated by a false alarm.\" But when, in the fall of 1930 after a football rally, excited students tore down the statue of the Christian Student (q.v.) and rushed out onto Nassau Street and rocked an interurban bus with women and chil\u00ad dren in it, he invoked the language of Swift's Gulliver's Travels and publicly castigated them for their \"Yahooism.\" (The ringleaders were subsequently suspended for a year.) It was particularly as dean that Gauss came to be appreciated for his sym\u00ad pathy and human understanding. \"Through many trying meetings of the discipline committee,\" Nelson P. Rose '31, who was chairman of the Prince- tonian and of the Undergraduate Council, recalled, \"you could not fail to sense his own pain at having to cause pain. . . . On campus issues you could not fail to realize that he was looking for a helpful middle ground.\" Some of his most ardent admirers were those who had frequented the mourner's bench outside the dean's office. Archie Murray '34, later a sports writer for the New York Evening Post, who had \"practically made a career of getting into trouble\" when he was an undergraduate, said he nevertheless looked up to Dean Gauss as a father\u2014 \"he was so eminently fair and his sense of humor never deserted him.\" Dean Gauss, for his part, showed his regard for those he had had to disci\u00ad pline in the early years of his deanship by dedicating his book Life in College (1930) to them. \"In nearly every case,\" he wrote, \"the frankness, honesty, generosity and sportsmanship of these undergraduate 'malefactors' was such as to make me conceive a higher opinion of mankind.\" Life in College was made up of a series of articles that had appeared in the Saturday Evening Post; articles by Gauss frequently appeared also in the New York Times, the Saturday Review, and the New Republic. During the De\u00ad pression, when seniors were worried about getting jobs, they sang: Professor Gauss he teaches French; Dean Gauss he judges on the bench; Mister Gauss don't write for fun; He's got three jobs and we've got none. 208 CHRISTIAN GAUSS As chairman of the University Coun\u00ad cil on Athletics, Gauss was impressed by the wholesome influence of football, \"properly coached and conducted,\" and was a concerned follower of all the games. \"We thrived on his love of vic\u00ad tory,\" said Gilbert Lea '36, an end on the championship team of 1935, \"but we were gratified most by his loyalty in defeat.\" In the latter years of his deanship, Gauss commanded the same respect and admiration he had won at the be\u00ad ginning. \"As a dean he was still in the best sense a teacher,\" John N. Brooks, Jr. '42, the writer, who in college was chairman of the Princetonian and a member of the Discipline Committee, recalled: An argument with him [at a meet\u00ad ing about extracurricular activities] was a profoundly educational thing. . . . Dean Gauss always took us and our point of view seriously, entering into every debate as vigorously as if the issues were all new to him. . . . For his disciplinary role . . . he might conveniently have become the gentle sentimentalist or the mar\u00ad tinet, but Dean Gauss did not choose easy roles. He did not even exude an air of infallibility, which must be the easiest and safest of all airs for a dean to exude. . . . He somehow suc\u00ad ceeded in making his office at 205 Nassau Hall, by its nature the most formidable precinct in all Princeton, into a place that even many of those who came there under duress re\u00ad member with real affection. Dean Gauss was a courageous cham\u00ad pion of freedom, both within and with\u00ad out the University. \"The first obligation of the undergraduate is to think without let or hindrance,\" he declared in reply to charges of radical tendencies at Princeton, Yale, and Harvard by Col\u00ad onel McCormick in the Chicago Tribune, \"and the first obligation of the professor is to make him do so.\" He was a member of the National Committee of the American Civil Liberties Union and an outspoken critic of the House Com\u00ad mittee on Un-American Activities. After the Second World War he fre\u00ad quently spoke to black audiences in the South, and took quiet satisfaction in having been responsible for assembling for the first time a mixed black and white audience in a white church in Richmond. In retirement Gauss worked on two projects for philanthropic foundations, one on religion in higher education, the other on promotion of the study of the humanities. He also served as presi\u00ad dent of Phi Beta Kappa. One autumn day in his seventy-fourth year he went to New York to deliver the manuscript of his introduction to a new edition of Machiavelli's The Prince and to attend a memorial service for the Austrian novelist, Herman Brock. That evening while he was waiting in the Pennsylva\u00ad nia station for the train to take him back to Princeton, his heart failed and he fell dead. \"One had always still expected some\u00ad thing further from Christian, had hoped that his character and talents would arrive at some final solution,\" Edmund Wilson wrote in his memoir of Dean Gauss and then concluded: But. . . one sees now that the career was complete, the achievement is all there. He has left no solid body of writing; he did not remake Princeton . . . he was not really a public man. He was a spiritual and intellectual force. . . . His great work in his gen\u00ad eration was unorganized and unob\u00ad trusive; and Who's Who will tell you GEOLOGICAL AND GEOPHYSICAL SCIENCES 209 nothing about it; but his influence was vital for those who felt it. Che in la mente me'efitta, ed or m'accora, La voi, .* * From Canto XV of the Inferno in which Dante addresses his teacher, Brunetto La- tini: \"For in my mind is fixed, and now fills my heart, the dear, good, paternal image of you, when in the world hour by hour you taught me how man makes himself eternal.\" (Charles Eliot Norton's translation, Houghton, Mifflin Com\u00ad pany, 1919) Gauss Seminars in Criticism, The, named in honor of Dean Christian Gauss (q.v.), were instituted in 1949 to provide a focus for discussion, study, and the exchange of ideas in the hu\u00ad manities. Normally five or six seminars are held annually. Each seminar is con\u00ad ducted by an invited guest, who pres\u00ad ents material upon which he is working or which seems to him significant, at from two to six weekly meetings. Past seminar leaders have included W. H. Auden, Noam Chomsky, Leon Edel, Jacques Maritain, Sean O'Faolain, Sir Herbert Read, Paul Tillich, Rene WeI- lek, Edmund Wilson. Some twenty- five or thirty persons, invited from the University Faculty, the Institute for Advanced Study, and the community at large, participate in each seminar. The Seminars are arranged by an interdepartmental committee, one of whose members serves as director. Serving in this capacity have been Pro\u00ad fessors since 1966, Joseph N. Frank. Geological and Geophysical Sciences, Department of. Instruction in geology was first offered from 1818 to 1822 by the Professor of Experimental Philoso\u00ad phy, Chemistry, and Natural History, Jacob Green, who gave courses in paleontology. Thereafter instruction in this area lapsed until 1855 when Arnold Guyot, a colleague of Louis Agassiz at Neuchatel, Switzerland, arrived in Princeton to begin what has become the present department. Continuous instruction has been given in geology or, more broadly, the earth sciences ever since. Until 1873 Guyot was the sole faculty member in geology and physical geog\u00ad raphy. During the next ten years four men came to Princeton to offer instruc\u00ad tion and carry on research in the gener\u00ad al field of geology. Henry B. Cornwall, a chemist, taught mineralogy. William Libbey 1877, first to receive the doc\u00ad toral degree at Princeton (1879), taught physical geography. William Berryman Scott 1877 arrived with Libbey in 1880 and began his long career in vertebrate paleontology. His classmate, Henry Fairfield Osborn, was in the section of biology. In those days the general sub\u00ad ject of geology was handled in three separate divisions: applied chemistry and mineralogy, physical geography, and geology\u2014and sometimes with the cooperation of the section of biology. In 1904, when the Department of Geology was formally created, six men made up the faculty: in physical geog\u00ad raphy, Libbey; in mineralogy, Corn\u00ad wall and Alexander H. Phillips (whose constant laugh is commemorated in the Faculty Song: \"Ha Ha Phillips, he he he I Teaches mineralogy\"); in verte\u00ad brate paleontology, Scott and Marcus 210 GEOLOGICAL AND GEOPHYSICAL SCIENCES Farr; and in invertebrate paleontology, Gilbert Van Ingen. The following year Charles H. Smyth (father of two other Princeton professors, the chemist Charles P. Smyth and the physicist Henry De W. Smyth) arrived to teach petrology, and William J. Sinclair joined the vertebrate paleontologists. Chairman of the new department was \"Geology Bill\" Scott, who gave an even fifty years of continuous service on the Princeton faculty from 1880 to 1930, equalling the record set by Presi\u00ad dent John Maclean in 1868. During his fifth year as chairman, the department moved to Guyot Hall, which had been built with funds provided by the mother of Cleveland Dodge 1879. Princeton's international reputation in the earth sciences during the early days of the department stemmed from the presence of Scott. But it was Smyth who attracted the graduate students, a fact Scott cheerfully recognized. Smyth taught courses in petrology and chemi\u00ad cal geology, both relatively new sub\u00ad jects in this country. The popularity of these subjects and the related subject of mineralogy was probably due to the fact that most jobs were to be found in the fields of mining geology and min\u00ad eral exploration. Not until the late 1920s and early 1930s did the expand\u00ad ing petroleum industry create large demands for people with paleontologi- cal and stratigraphic training. From 1920 to 1930 a new generation of geologists arrived, all overlapping original members of the department. These men, who included Arthur Bud- dington, Arthur K. Snelgrove, Edward Sampson, W. Taylor Thorn, Paul MacClintock, Glenn L. Jepsen, Erling Dorf, Richard M. Field, and Benjamin F. Howell, carried the department's distinction into the 1950s. On their re\u00ad tirement in the late 1950s, Thorn, Bud-dington, Howell, MacClintock, and Sampson had together served Prince\u00ad ton for 173 years. During the immediate prewar years the department experienced a large in\u00ad crease in both undergraduate and graduate enrollments. During the war the faculty helped hundreds of armed forces trainees discover the techniques of map and terrain interpretation as part of their officer training. Buddington served as chairman of the department for fourteen years and was succeeded in 1950 by Harry H. Hess, who served for sixteen years. Under Hess's leadership the depart\u00ad ment acquired its present form. Hess, who was hired as a mineralogist in 1934, developed into a remarkable generalist. His interests extended from objects of microscopic size to ocean ba\u00ad sins measured in thousands of kilome\u00ad ters, and ranged from the deep interior of the earth to the moon and beyond. His single most important achievement was the formulation, in 1960, of the concept of \"sea-floor spreading.\" This idea, introduced as a bit of \"geo- poetry,\" literally shook the foundations of geology, giving the subject a frame\u00ad work as important to it as organic evolu\u00ad tion, the periodic table, and the atom have been to biology, chemistry, and physics. In the decade following World War II, new faculty members included John C. Maxwell (who succeeded Hess as chairman), Franklyn B. Van Houten, H. D. Holland, William Bonini, Shel\u00ad don Judson (who followed Maxwell as chairman), Alfred G. Fischer, Jorma O. Kalliokoski, and Hollis D. Hedberg. Geophysics became an important part of the departmental program of in\u00ad struction and research in the early 1960s; this significant addition was rec\u00ad ognized in 1968 by changing the name GERMANIC LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES 211 Department of Geology to Department of Geological and Geophysical Sci\u00ad ences. Walter Elsasser was followed by Robert Phinney, Fred Vine, Jason Morgan, and Anthony Dahlen. The work of this group soon attracted world-wide attention, particularly through the studies of Morgan and Vine. Building on the ideas of Hess, Vine demonstrated the reality of the timing of sea-floor spreading through magnetic studies of the sea floor, and Morgan defined and described the plates that make up the jigsaw puzzle of the earth's crust. A well-known facility of the depart\u00ad ment is the Museum of Natural History in Guyot Hall. Originally called the E. M. Museum of Geology and Archaeol\u00ad ogy (after Elizabeth Marsh, the mother of William Libbey), it moved from what is now the Faculty Room in Nassau Hall when Guyot Hall opened in 1908. It has included among its directors Guyot (its founder), Libbey, Sinclair, and Jepsen. Its exhibits are drawn from excellent collections of minerals, rock types, vertebrate and invertebrate specimens. The department for many years has also served as a repository for some important ethnological collections from the American Northwest, the South Seas, Africa, and the southwest\u00ad ern United States. As of the 1970s, the department maintained a cooperative program in Water Resources with Civil Engineer\u00ad ing, another in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics with the National Oceano- graphic and Atmospheric Administra\u00ad tion's Laboratory, and still another in Geological Engineering with the School of Engineering. The depart\u00ad ment had a full-time faculty of sixteen and, in addition, six visiting scientists. Its Ph.D. program enrolled between thirty and forty students, and under\u00adgraduate majors graduating each year numbered between fifteen and twenty- five. Sheldon Judson Germanic Languages and Literatures. For the first 84 years of Princeton's his\u00ad tory, the College itself offered no in\u00ad struction in modern languages\u2014though it did authorize outsiders to serve as tutors, at the students' expense. The appointment of the first faculty member in German seems to have come as an afterthought. In 1832 Ben\u00ad edict Jaegar, A.M., an Austrian, was engaged as Curator of the Zoological Museum and Lecturer on Natural His\u00ad tory. Perhaps because he was \"a man of talent and learning, and an admirable teacher,\" he was also named Professor of German and Italian. Jaeger discharged his diverse duties until 1843. Thereafter, German was taught by a succession of short-term in\u00ad structors until the appointment in 1857 of the German-born Karl Langlotz (far better known as the composer of the music to \"Old Nassau\"), who served until 1869. At that time the study of modern languages was entirely volun\u00ad tary, and as Langlotz later recalled, students would drop out until his class of forty members was reduced to \"ten or so faithful ones.\" The man who finally established modern languages as a regular part of the curriculum was President McCosh, in 1868, the first year of his administra\u00ad tion. The man he appointed as the first John H. Woodhull Professor of Modern Languages was surely the most flam\u00ad boyant holder of that distinguished chair: General Joseph Karge. A native of Prussia, Karge had studied at Bres- lau, Paris, and Berlin; had twice been imprisoned as a Polish freedom fighter; had fled to the United States and be-212 GEST ORIENTAL LIBRARY come a Civil War hero; and then, from 1869 to 1892, quietly taught German and French at Princeton. His arrival marked the beginning of a new era for the teaching of German. He was later joined by Herman C. O. Huss, and followed by Willard C. Humphreys, J. Preston Hoskins, George Madison Priest, and Max F. Blau. Whereas 1869 marked the start of regular modern language instruction, 1904 marked its consolidation. In that year Woodrow Wilson established the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures. Among the \"preceptor guys\" whom he chose in 1905 were Priest and Harvey W. Hewett-Thayer. Alumni (including the writer, Class of 1935) remember the superb instruction that they received from the peppery Hoskins (who used to start off lectures by removing his false teeth), from their friend and mentor Priest (who trans\u00ad lated Goethe's Faust), and from the gentle and humane Hewett-Thayer (who wrote Hoffmann: Author of the Tales). From 1938 to 1940 the distinguished author Thomas Mann was Lecturer in German. Others who in these and later years joined the Department of Mod\u00ad ern Languages and Literatures as teachers of German were Bernhard Ulmer in 1936 (retired 1976), Werner G. Hollmann in 1945 (retired 1976), Walter SiIz in 1948 (in 1954 he went to Columbia), and Victor Lange in 1957 (retired 1977). In 1958 German was made a separate department, with Lange as first chair\u00ad man. Lange enlarged the size and scope of the new department through a number of appointments: in 1960 Wil\u00ad liam G. Moulton, a in 1963 Michael J. H. Curschmann, a medi\u00ad evalist; in 1964 Theodore J. Ziolkow- ski (named chairman in 1973), with primary interest in modern German literature; and in 1966 Stanley A. Corngold, a teacher of German and comparative literature. During 1965- 1970 Lange was president of the Inter\u00ad national Association of Germanists, and the 1970 congress of this organization was held at Princeton. Princeton's German department, though relatively small, has come to be widely recognized as one of the most at\u00ad tractive in the country. Like many de\u00ad partments elsewhere, it provides in\u00ad struction not only in literature but also in a practical command of German; and this aim is supported by a \"summer work program,\" which annually enables many students to spend a summer ac\u00ad tively using German in a German- speaking country. As in all other mod\u00ad ern language departments at Princeton, the interests of faculty members extend beyond their own particular profes\u00ad sional fields. Many teach courses in European literature, in general as well as Germanic linguistics, or hold joint appointments with Comparative Liter\u00ad ature. Uniquely among modern lan\u00ad guage departments at Princeton, Ger\u00ad man offers three types of undergradu\u00ad ate majors: language and literature, language and linguistics, and culture and civilization. William G. Moulton Gest Oriental Library, The, which has been administered by the University since 1937, is one of the Western world's greatest Chinese collections. It includes among other treasures several thousand fine and rare editions that were printed before the Gutenberg Bi\u00ad ble, and one of the world's three com\u00ad plete sets of the original 1728 edition of the famous 5,000-volume Chinese En\u00ad cyclopedia. The Library's two thousand BASIL LANNEAU GILDERSLEEVE 213 volumes on medicine constitute the largest collection of traditional Chinese medical books outside China and Ja\u00ad pan. This extraordinary library was founded by Guion M. Gest (1864-1948) and I. V. Gillis (1875-1948). Gest, a Quaker in religion and an engineer by profession, suffered from glaucoma. On a business trip to China, he met Gillis (then a naval attache at the American embassy in Peking), who persuaded him to try an old Chinese eye remedy. Although this medicine did not cure the glaucoma, it gave Gest some tem\u00ad porary relief and led him to commission Gillis to buy Chinese books on medicine for him. Gest later extended his interest to other fields and for thirty years impoverished himself to provide Gillis with the funds required to in\u00ad dulge his love of books. In the end, his library numbered some 100,000 vol\u00ad umes. In 1937, the Institute for Advanced Study, with help from the Rockefeller Foundation, acquired the Gest Library and housed it in a University-owned building at 20 Nassau Street. In 1948 the Institute transferred custodianship to the University and the collection was moved to Firestone Library. In 1972 the collection was moved to Palmer- Jones, the home of the Department of East Asian Studies. The University's East Asian Collections, which include the Gest Oriental Library, now total three hundred thousand volumes in the East Asian languages, in addition to the University's holdings in Western lan\u00ad guages, making it one of the five largest East Asian research collections in the Western world. Gildersleeve, Basil Lanneau 1849 (1831-1924) was one of the most emi\u00ad nent men graduated from Princeton in the middle of the nineteenth century. Dean West called him \"the most bril\u00ad liant, richly furnished and powerful master in Greek studies\" this country had produced. Professor Paul Shorey of the University of Chicago, himself a great Greek scholar, said that, during fifty years of American classical scholarship, \"the figure of Gildersleeve had dominated throughout.\" The son of a Presbyterian minister in Charleston, South Carolina, Gil\u00ad dersleeve read the Bible \"from cover to cover\" when he was five and before he was thirteen had learned enough Latin to get through Caesar, Sallust, Cicero, Virgil, and Horace, and enough Greek \"to make out\" the New Testament. Such was his precocity that when he entered Princeton as a junior at the age of sixteen in 1847 he was able to devote most of his time to his own reading. \"I gave a couple of hours to my classes each day,\" he recalled in a memoir about his student days which he wrote toward the end of this life, \"and then ho! for the wide field of literature\u2014 English, French, German, Italian, Spanish.\" Through Carlyle, he was in\u00ad troduced to Goethe, \"the most impor\u00ad tant of all I ever had.\" Besides his \"multifarious, jubilant read\u00ad ing,\" he also indulged himself in \"com\u00ad position in prose and rhyme.\" He ad\u00ad mired the physicist Joseph Henry, \"our one great man,\" and respected John Torrey, who taught chemistry and nat\u00ad ural history, and Stephen Alexander, who taught mathematics. \"Stevie\" so inspired him, he recalled, that although he had always hated mathematics, he passed the best examination in his class. But he found little to be learned from the \"hit-or-miss\" instruction of\u00ad fered in his own field of interest\u2014the classics and letters generally. In the course in Greek he could not recall one 214 BASIL LANNEAU GILDERSLEEVE syntactical question and there were only two lectures on Greek literature. But my heart smites me [Gil\u00ad dersleeve wrote]. Remember that I am writing of Rev. John Maclean, Vice President of the College . . . and Professor of Greek, judged by a pro\u00ad fessor of Greek, not of good old Johnny, best beloved of all Princeton men, a man every inch of him, in his prime a swift-footed Achilles, who, according to tradition, gave the err\u00ad ing Hectors a start as far as the cannon and always caught them; Johnny who watched over me tenderly when I lay greviously hurt at the house where that angel, Miss Mary [Maclean's sis\u00ad ter], prepared delicacies for me, and Bob Stockton dressed my wound, acquired in a frog hunt near Dr. Scudder's. Some day another profes\u00ad sor of Greek will make mock of my old-fashioned fancies in the matter of syntax. Would that I had as fair a record otherwise as good old Johnny! After graduating from Princeton in 1849, Gildersleeve spent three years in Europe, chiefly in study at German universities. To his teachers there and to Germany in general he acknowl\u00ad edged his indebtedness \"for everything professionally in the way of apparatus and method, and for much, very much in the way of inspiration.\" Shortly after his return from Europe, Princeton proposed that he join its fac\u00ad ulty; but the position offered, he re\u00ad called years later, turned out to be so inferior to what he, \"a conceited young\u00ad ster,\" deemed his due as a Ph.D. with high honors from the University of Gottingen, that the negotiations were broken off with some acerbity on both sides. For three years he pursued philolog\u00ad ical studies at home and nearly com\u00adpleted a novel. In 1856, just before his twenty-fifth birthday, he began a twenty-year career as professor of Greek at the University of Virginia. He also taught Latin for a time, but Greek remained his true love. A regular churchgoer, he kept himself awake dur\u00ad ing sermons by mentally translating them into Greek, sentence by sentence as uttered, a practice he recommended as \"a peculiarly rewarding means of grace.\" During the Civil War Gildersleeve became further disenchanted with Princeton \"when the authorities thought it necessary to emphasize their loyalty to the Union in a way that exasperated all ardent Southerners like myself.\" Both of his Princeton room\u00ad mates, who were Virginians, fell in the first major engagement of the war at Manassas. Gildersleeve himself was se\u00ad verely wounded while serving with the Confederate cavalry. In later years, his northern students shared with their southern compatriots admiration for his soldierly valor, of which they were continually reminded, as one of them wrote, \"by the choliambic [limping] rhythm in his majestic gait.\" When Johns Hopkins University was founded in 1876, Gildersleeve was the first of a small band of scholars invited to develop a school of graduate work and research. According to one of his first students, Francis G. Allison, later professor at Brown University, Gil\u00ad dersleeve liked to recount that \"he was put by President Gilman into an empty room and told to 'radiate!' \" The bare room [Allinson wrote] was soon occupied by graduates of diverse colleges. . . . Whatever their previous training, the fortunate members of his Greek seminary, year after year, were confronted with a BASIL LANNEAU GILDERSLEEVE 215 new vision, shining across wide vistas in literature and language. As in his more personal teaching, where a \"mistake\" was a \"crime,\" so in the wider sweep of his seminary courses an ineluctable exactitude prevailed. No vagueness was acceptable. No unverified reference was legal. Paradoxically, however, he indulged himself in a rapid fire of allusions which sometimes shot over the heads of his bewildered, yet devoted, hear\u00ad ers. In spite of this, he stimulated more than he discouraged and, as net effect in after years, his former stu\u00ad dents, though far removed in space and time, were conscious of his ac\u00ad tual presence, ready to challenge any inadequacy or inaccuracy in their written or spoken word. In 1877, Princeton \"held out an olive branch,\" as Gildersleeve put it, by in\u00ad viting him to make the annual address before the Whig and Cliosophic Societies. But he \"did not improve mat\u00ad ters,\" he said, by the chief theme of his discourse, \"an inquiry why Princeton, which had done so much for divinity, for medicine, for law, for legislation, for arms, had fallen so far short in letters.\" Gildersleeve meantime was making his own mark as a man of letters as well as a scholar. In 1880 he founded the American journal of Philology, and for forty years his personality pervaded its pages. \"His uncurbed satire,\" one of his associates said, \"occasionally engen\u00ad dered resentment, but his fearless crit\u00ad icism had a tonic effect upon contempo\u00ad rary scholarship.\" He became famous also for his Latin Grammar, his Syntax of Cfassical Greek, his editions of Greek poets, notably Pindar, and sev\u00ad eral books of critical essays and scholarly studies. In 1899, at the fiftieth anniversary of the graduation of his class, Princeton conferred on him an honorary L. H. D.\u2014\"the seal,\" he said, \"of recon\u00ad ciliation.\" He took pride, also, in the fact that his son, Baleigh C. Gil\u00ad dersleeve, was the architect of McCosh Hall and Lower Pyne Building. Gildersleeve had a tall, well- proportioned figure, an Olympian head with \"dominating eyes, humorous or devastating as the occasion demanded,\" and in later life a full white beard. His students called him Zeus. He taught at Johns Hopkins until he was eighty-four and edited the Journal of Philology until he was eighty-nine. In his last years he spent most of his time in his book-lined study in his house in Balti\u00ad more, reading Greek and writing son\u00ad nets. One he wrote when he was ninety concluded: I know this sonnet-writing is inanity. It is not art. 'Tis nothing but a knack With which I while away the dark\u00ad some hours. I'll keep it up, though critics doubt my sanity Till the pale postman comes whose knocks attack Alike the poor men's cots and princes' towers. When the \"pale postman\" knocked some two years later, Dean West deliv\u00ad ered Princeton's tribute, concluding with a quotation from the Greek rhetorician and philosopher Longinus: \"When the sun sets, its brightness de\u00ad parts and its greatness remains.\" And Professor Shorey noted that, at the memorial service for Gildersleeve at Johns Hopkins, all the speakers \"dwelt not so much on the wit, the brilliancy, the scholarship, which they took for granted, as on the moral qualities of the man, the teacher, the companion, the helper, the friend.\" 216 THE GLEE CLUB Glee Club, The, was founded in 1874 in response to an editorial in the Feb\u00ad ruary Nassau Lit, in which Andrew Fleming West 1874 (later dean of the Graduate School) lamented Princeton's lack of such a society and urged the \"University Quartet\" to \"take this mat\u00ad ter in hand and push it energetically.\" That popular campus singing group acted quickly and vigorously; the Glee Club was formally organized at a stu\u00ad dent meeting in March and gave its first concert at Commencement time. In its early years the Club had only thirteen members. Its modest reper\u00ad toire consisted mostly of college songs, and included \"Old Nassau,\" the open\u00ad ing number of the first concert. In 1876 the newly formed Instru\u00ad mental Club, a rudimentary orchestra, performed at the Glee Club's spring concert. This collaboration, which con\u00ad tinued for almost a decade, was later taken up by the Banjo Club in 1884 and the Mandolin Club in 1890; they per\u00ad formed at Glee Club concerts until the early 1930s. Since then, as its capabilities have grown, the Club has sung with the University and other orchestras. Very early the Club began schedul\u00ad ing concerts outside of Princeton, tak\u00ad ing brief tours during the spring recess and then longer ones at Christmas\u00ad time. In 1894 the Christmas tour ex\u00ad tended as far west as Denver, Col\u00ad orado. By the opening years of this century the Club had become particularly ac\u00ad tive during the football season. At the games Club members sat together in order to take the lead in student singing between halves, a practice that con\u00ad tinued until the founding of the Uni\u00ad versity Band in 1920. There were also occasional concerts before important games, and in 1913 Princeton, Har\u00advard, and Yale Glee Clubs began hold\u00ad ing dual concerts on the eve of Big Three games, a custom followed with only a few lapses ever since. The Glee Club had a succession of instructors but no steady professional guidance until 1907 when Charles E. Burnham was appointed director. He was succeeded in 1918 by Alexander Russell, who served until 1934, when, music having gained a place in the Uni\u00ad versity's curriculum, the Glee Club be\u00ad came a responsibility of the music fac\u00ad ulty. James Giddings became director in 1934, Timothy Cheney in 1940, J. Merrill Knapp in 1941, Russell Ames Cook in 1943, J. Merrill Knapp in 1946, Elliot Forbes in 1952, Carl Weinrich in 1953, and Walter L. Nollner in 1958. The Club's musical development led to a number of notable achievements in the thirties. It joined with the Phila\u00ad delphia orchestra under Leopold Sto- kowski in the American premiere of Stravinsky's \"Oedipus Rex\" in 1931 and in performances of Schonberg's \"Gur- relieder\" and Wagner's \"Parsifal\" in the next two years. It presented Bach's Mass in B Minor at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1935 and with the Vas- sar College Choir gave the first United States performance of Jean Philippe Rameau's \"Castor et Pollux\" in 1937. The Club continued to sing with choral groups from Vassar, Bryn Mawr, Wellesley, Mount Holyoke, and Smith until a mixed Princeton chorus was formed after the advent of coeducation. In company with singers from Smith College, the Club toured Europe in 1965 and 1968, Mexico in 1969, and South America in 1971. In the summer of 1965 the Smith- Princeton chorus gave concerts in Munich, Salzburg, Rome, and other cities, took part in the famous choral festival at Spoleto, made a radio and THE GLEE CLUB 217 television appearance in Paris, and gave a final concert in the Chartres cathedral. In 1968 they sang a Josquin des Pres mass, a Bach cantata, and other works in West Berlin, Nurem\u00ad berg, Prague, Vienna, and Venice, again concluding with a concert at Chartres, which was taped for radio and television. A French critic commended their \"naturalness . . . of interpre\u00ad tation.\" The visits to Latin America were also well received, In 1969 the Smith- Princeton singers appeared with the Mexican National Symphony in Mexico City's Palace of Fine Arts. They re\u00ad ceived standing ovations throughout South America in 1971. High points of their tour were appearances with the Argentine Air Force band at a Fourth of July celebration at the United States Embassy in Buenos Aires and with the National Symphony Orchestra of Brazil in a performance of Haydn's \"Pauken- messe\" in Rio de Janeiro. The first foreign tour of an all- Princeton mixed chorus in the spring of 1972 was sponsored by the Yale- Harvard-Princeton Club of Jamaica. In Kingston the Glee Club sang to 16,000 schoolchildren on the front lawn of the prime minister's official residence, join\u00ad ing with them at the end in the Jamaican national anthem. On the 1973 trip to Mexico the Glee Club was accompanied by a chamber orchestra. They preformed works of Brahms and Haydn and Latin American folk songs in five concerts, gave an in\u00ad formal concert at Ambassador Robert H. McBride '40's reception for them, and sang \"Old Nassau\" on top of the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan. During the Latin-American tours the performers, who were guests in private homes in each country, took every op\u00adportunity to sing folk songs of the host countries as well as of the United States, and gave a number of free con\u00ad certs in order to reach wide audiences. Everywhere they received a warm re\u00ad ception, caused in large part, Professor Nollner reported, \"by the realization that we were coming to learn and to give of our art.\" In 1974 the Club celebrated its hun\u00ad dredth birthday with a concert in Alex\u00ad ander Hall, repeated a few nights later in Carnegie Hall. An ensemble of men and women adding up to an appropriate total of 100 singers, accompanied by soloists and orchestra, presented works by Arnold Schonberg, who was born the same year as the Glee Club, as well as by Bach and Haydn. A Times critic complimented the singers on the \"flex\u00ad ible, transparent, even airy, massed tone\" they achieved in program cho\u00ad sen and presented with . . . taste and musical discrimination.\" SMALL SINGING GROUPS The quartet that originated the Glee Club in the 1870s has had its modern counterparts in small singing groups, the first of which spun off from the Glee Club before the Second World War. They called themselves the Nassoons and they became noted for their close harmony, exact blending of voices, and five- (rather than four-) part arrange\u00ad ments, some of which were handed down to them by their Glee Club di\u00ad rector, a Yale Whiffenpoof. The Nassoons were followed by two other men's groups, the Tigertones (1947) and the Footnotes (1959), and after the advent of coeducation by a women's group, the Tigerlilies, (1971), and a mixed ensemble, the Katzen- jammers (1975). For the initiated, each of these groups may have its own special style, 218 ROBERT FRANCIS GOHEEN but an average listener is apt to be most impressed by something they all share: the enjoyment they take in their sing\u00ad ing and their ability to impart that en\u00ad joyment to those who listen. This they do at paid engagements at proms and club house parties, at alumni dinners and reunions, at southern resorts dur\u00ad ing the spring recess, and on more free-spirited occasions beneath Sev\u00ad enty-Nine Tower after football games and at the top of Blair steps with the first sign of spring or at Christmastime. Goheen, Robert Francis, sixteenth president of Princeton, was born Au\u00ad gust 15, 1919, at Vengurla, Bombay Presidency, India, where his father, Dr. Robert H. H. Goheen, was a Presbyte\u00ad rian medical missionary. The son re\u00ad mained in India, except for furloughs that brought the family to temporary residences in Wooster, Ohio and Princeton, until he was fifteen, when he enrolled in the Lawrenceville School. After two years at Lawrence\u00ad ville, he was graduated with honors. For him Princeton was the logical choice of college. His grandfather, Joseph M. Goheen (also a Presbyterian missionary in India), had graduated with the Class of 1872. An uncle on his mother's side of the family, Rhea M. Ewing, was a member of the Class of 1924. An older brother, Richard R. P. Goheen, graduated in 1936. In the fall of that year, Bob, as he was commonly known to the very end of his presidency by a large part of the faculty and staff, began his own career at Princeton with the Class of 1940. As a freshman Goheen won his nu\u00ad merals in both soccer and baseball. Thereafter he played on the varsity soc\u00ad cer team through three years in which two league championships were won. After his graduation, while enrolled as a first-year graduate student, he coached a freshman soccer team that lost only to Pennsylvania and defeated a thereto\u00ad fore unbeaten Yale team. His eating club was Quadrangle, of which he served as president. He was a member of the Inter-Club Committee, the In\u00ad tramural Athletic Association, Whig- Clio, the Undergraduate Council, and Phi Beta Kappa. He graduated with Highest Honors in the Humanities Program, and in 1940 shared with James H. Worth the M. Taylor Pyne Prize, the highest general distinction conferred upon an undergraduate. In November 1941, after completing a year of graduate study with the De\u00ad partment of Classics, Goheen entered the army. During the preceding June, he had been married to Margaret M. Skelly of Wilmington, Delaware. Upon graduating from Officer Train\u00ad ing School, he was commissioned in May 1942 as a second lieutenant in the Infantry and assigned to the Military Intelligence Service in the War De\u00ad partment. In March 1943 he was reas\u00ad signed to the First Cavalry Division, with which he served in the Pacific until the summer of 1945, receiving decorations that included the Legion of Merit and the Bronze Star with two clusters. During his last year of service, he was Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2 for the Division and held the rank of lieutenant-colonel. After the war Goheen returned to Princeton to continue his graduate studies. In the fall of 1945 he became one of the three men to whom the first Woodrow Wilson Fellowships were awarded, under a program initiated at Princeton for the encouragement of young men to find a career in teaching and scholarship. He received the M. A. degree in 1947, and in 1948, after a ROBERT FRANCIS GOHEEN 219 year as a Procter Fellow, was awarded his Ph.D. Goheen was immediately appointed as an Instructor in the Department of Classics, and in 1950 was promoted to an assistant professorship. His major scholarly work, The Imagery of Sopho\u00ad cles' Antigone, was published by Princeton University Press in 1951. He was the Arthur H. Scribner Bicenten\u00ad nial Preceptor from September 1951 to June 1954, and in 1952-1953, during his Bicentennial Preceptorial leave, a Senior Fellow in Classics at the Ameri\u00ad can Academy in Rome. After returning from his year of study abroad in 1953, Goheen became di\u00ad rector of the National Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Program, a position to which he devoted half of his time through the following three years. The program had been greatly expanded since the initial appointment of three returning war veterans as fellows in 1945, having acquired the sponsorship of the American Association of Univer\u00ad sities and won substantial funding by foundations. By the academic year 1954-1955 the men and women who had held, or then held, the fellowships numbered 478; twelve regional com\u00ad mittees served, with the aid of special representatives on individual faculties, to select the fellows from the many who were nominated for the honor. Be\u00ad tween meeting classes in Princeton, Goheen spent much of his time on the road and in the process became well known among educators across the country. He was elected to the presidency of Princeton by unanimous vote of the trustees on December 7, 1956, and at the same time was promoted from the rank of assistant professor to full profes\u00ad sor. When he assumed ofRce at the age of thirty-seven on July 1, 1957, he be\u00adcame the third youngest president in the history of the University (Aaron Burr, Sr., 1748-1757, had been thirty- two; Samuel Davies, 1759-1761, thirty- five). In his annual report for 1967 to the trustees, President Goheen summa\u00ad rized the first ten years of his adminis\u00ad tration as a period of \"growth and change . . . in almost every part of the university.\" The description is no less applicable to the entire span of fifteen years in which he served as president. Although he repeatedly disclaimed any ambition to be known as a \"build\u00ad ing president,\" more was added to the physical plant during his administration than under any of his predecessors. Some twenty-five new buildings were constructed on the main campus, still others at the Graduate College and Forrestal. All told, if measured in terms of square footage under roof, the physi\u00ad cal plant increased by 80 percent. In addition, many of the older buildings were renovated to provide more useful space for instructional departments. Among the more important additions were the Art Museum, the Woolworth Center of Musical Studies, the Ar\u00ad chitecture Building, the Woodrow Wil\u00ad son School, the Engineering Quad\u00ad rangle, the Jadwin Gymnasium, the Computer Center, and the complex of Peyton, Fine, and Jadwin Halls con\u00ad structed for the mathematical and phys\u00ad ical sciences in the area immediately adjacent to Palmer Stadium. All of these buildings housed expanded edu\u00ad cational programs. This physical expansion was accom\u00ad panied by a proportionate increase in the financial resources of the Univer\u00ad sity. The annual budget grew from ap\u00ad proximately $20 million to $80 million. Contributions by the general body of alumni through Annual Giving more 220 ROBERT FRANCIS GOHEEN than doubled, reaching a total of $3.8 million in the last year of Goheen's ad\u00ad ministration. More than twenty newly endowed chairs were established for members of the faculty. The faculty grew in size from just under 500 to more than 700, thereby maintaining the enviable student- teacher ratio for which Princeton had become noted. The number of appli\u00ad cants for admission to the college in Goheen's last year was more than two and a half times the number who applied during his first year in office. Undergraduate enrollment increased from nearly 3,000 to almost 4,000. The number of graduate students more than doubled. President Goheen was deeply com\u00ad mitted to Princeton's traditional emphasis on teaching combined with scholarship. \"Pursued together,\" he observed, \"they generate an atmos\u00ad phere of learning that invigorates and gives added point to both.\" In the growing strength of the Graduate School he saw a strengthening also of undergraduate teaching. A national survey of graduate programs of study sponsored by the American Council on Education in 1969 rated 26 depart\u00ad ments of instruction at Princeton and ranked 20 of them among the top ten in the country. The undergraduate program of study found a new flexibility and variety in its response to what the president de\u00ad scribed as \"an exploding, booming, shifting world of knowledge and ideas.\" Provision was made for sophomore concentration, a reading period at the end of each term, a reduction in course requirements for underclassmen, a University Scholar Program, and stu\u00ad dent-initiated seminars. New interde\u00ad partmental programs were introduced, among them the History and Philos\u00adophy of Science; Science in Human Af\u00ad fairs; Comparative Literature; and East Asian, Latin American, Russian, Afri\u00ad can, Afro-American, Urban, and Medieval Studies. No less marked was President Go\u00ad heen's active interest in the quality of student life. Without challenging the established eating clubs on Prospect Avenue, he assumed leadership in the creation of a number of alternative so\u00ad cial facilities. With new programs of study and al\u00ad ternative social facilities came also a new diversification of the student body. In 1969 for the first time women were enrolled as undergraduate candidates for a degree. As early as 1961, they had been admitted as candidates for de\u00ad grees in the Graduate School, provided they could demonstrate some educa\u00ad tional opportunity that was unique to Princeton, a condition abandoned in 1968. Simultaneously, the number of blacks and students representative of other disadvantaged minorities was greatly increased. It was not by chance that a selection of President Goheen's addresses and other papers published by Princeton University Press in 1969 carried the title The Human Nature of a Univer\u00ad sity. He had a sensitive regard for the individuals (and their individuality) who make up a university. He had too a gift for maintaining rapport with them, whether students or members of the faculty and staff. Perhaps it was this quality, as much as any other, that en\u00ad abled Goheen, in the later years of his administration, to bring Princeton through the most troubled period in the history of American higher educa\u00ad tion free of enduring scars. Having more than once expressed the opinion that in a time of rapid change fifteen years was as long as a GOLF 221 president should serve, he announced his intention to retire more than a year before he actually retired on June 30, 1972. The Princetonian, in a special issue of May 1971 devoted to the \"Go- heen Years,\" hailed him as \"a superla\u00ad tive example of what a university presi\u00ad dent should be.\" The graduating seniors at the following commencement gave him a spontaneous ovation. A year later another ovation came from the faculty at its last meeting with Goheen in the chair. A tribute pre\u00ad sented in behalf of the faculty by one of its senior members recalled chiefly the recent past, when \"momentous deci\u00ad sions had to be made in an atmosphere charged with feelings of shock, outrage, and anger,\" and credited the president with \"the leadership we needed in a period of anxiety and confusion.\" The tribute concluded: \"It was not simply that we trusted your judgment, good as it has proved to be. We trusted you as a man. . . . We admired your dignity and calmness in times of stress, your open-mindedness and fairness in times of controversy, and your endless pa\u00ad tience as we groped towards a solution of our problems. And it is because we trusted you and because you deserved our trust that Princeton still flourishes under the grace of God.\" The citation for an honorary degree conferred upon Goheen at the com\u00ad mencement of 1972 came unusually close to capturing the essential qualities of the man: \"In his eyes the function of the intellect is so lofty that it becomes a form of morality. Patient, always hu\u00ad mane and trustworthy, he is personally humble at the very time that he is rock- ily steadfast (an unsympathetic witness might say stubborn), not because he fails to understand and respect the views of others but because he refuses to compromise his own enduring val\u00adues. By never seeking popularity, by never worrying about his own image in the eyes of others, he has gained the af\u00ad fection and respect of the entire univer\u00ad sity and led it to new achievement, new unity.\" On his retirement in 1972, Goheen became president of the Council on Foundations. In 1977 he was appointed United States Ambassador to India. W. Frank Craven Golf came to Princeton in 1895 when alumni, faculty, and undergraduates formed the Princeton Golf Club, later renamed the Springdale Golf Club, and laid out a nine-hole golf course, sub\u00ad sequently extended to eighteen holes. In the first tournament of the newly formed Intercollegiate Golf Association in 1897, Louis P. Bayard, Jr. '98 won the individual championship. Although other Princetonians won individual championships\u2014Percy R. Pyne 2nd '03 in 1899, Francis O. Rinehart '05 in 1903, and Albert Seckel '12 in 1909\u2014it was not until 1914 and 1916 that Princeton won its first and second team championships. In 1919 S. Davidson Herron '18, who had been a member of the cham\u00ad pionship team of 1916, beat Bobby Jones, then seventeen years old, for the national amateur championship. Her\u00ad ron was a member of the 1923 United States Walker Cup team. Until the First World War, Yale led the Intercollegiate Golf Association, but after the war, Princeton came to the fore, winning the intercollegiate championship in 1919, 1920, 1922, and 1923. J. Simpson Dean '21 won the in\u00ad dividual intercollegiate championship in 1921. After an interval of three years, Princeton was on top again, taking the 222 GOVERNORS 1927, 1928, 1929, and 1930 intercol\u00ad legiate championships. George T. Dun- lap, Jr. '31 won the individual intercol\u00ad legiate championship in 1930 and 1931 and the national amateur championship in 1933. Another string of winning seasons came in the late 1930s. The 1937 team won the national intercollegiate cham\u00ad pionship, the 1938 and 1939 teams took the eastern intercollegiate champion\u00ad ship, and the 1940 team tied with Lou\u00ad isiana State for the national intercol\u00ad legiate championship. Princeton enjoyed another period of supremacy immediately after the Sec\u00ad ond World War. The teams of 1946 and 1947 -were undefeated in the regular season, and the 1947 team won the eastern intercollegiate championship in a day of exciting competition at the Atlantic City Country Club. In the morning semi-final round, Princeton nosed out Penn State when Harry E. Hall '48 won an extra-hole match by scoring an eagle 3 on the par 5 first hole, and in the afternoon final round against Navy, Dick Nash '45's hole-in- one on the par 3 eighteenth hole in the last match gave Princeton the cham\u00ad pionship. William C. Campbell '45, captain of both the 1946 and 1947 teams, con\u00ad tinued to excel in amateur golf after graduation. A member of seven Walker Cup teams and captain in 1955, he re\u00ad ceived the Bob Jones Award for Dis\u00ad tinguished Sportsmanship from the United States Golf Association in 1956, and won the national amateur cham\u00ad pionship in 1964. The sixties and early seventies brought consistently fine performances by Princeton golf teams, highlighted by the winning of eastern intercollegiate tournaments in 1961, 1968, and 1969, and Ivy League championships in 1972, 1973, and 1976. Winners of individual eastern intercollegiate championships were Mike Porter '69 in 1968 and Bud Zachary '70 in 1969. Golf coaches since 1927 have in\u00ad Walter R. Bill Quacken- bush, since 1971. Governors. Forty-two governors of nineteen states have been alumni of Princeton, ranging from eighteenth- century figures like \"Light-horse Harry\" Lee 1773 of Virginia and Wil\u00ad liam Richardson Davie 1776 of North Carolina to twentieth-century notables such as Woodrow Wilson 1879 of New Jersey and Adlai E. Stevenson '22 of Illinois. The complete list follows: CONNECTICUT Henry Waggaman Edwards 1797 (1835-37) DELAWARE Pierre S.

Designed by Ralph Adams Cram in close collabora\u00ad tion with the first dean of the Graduate School, Andrew Fleming West, this imposing group of connected Gothic buildings was the first residential col\u00ad lege in America devoted solely to post\u00ad graduate liberal studies. (In Princeton usage, \"Graduate College\" refers to the residential and dining halls, \"Graduate School\" to the program of instruction.) Situated on a hill half a mile from the main campus, the buildings of the Col\u00ad lege are unified by the random walls of brown and gray Princeton stone and slate roofs of green and blue. The en\u00ad semble consists of a lofty tower whose beauty of design has been compared with that of Oxford's Magdalen tower (\"by moonlight, . . . a dream in silvery grays and whites,\" Dean West wrote to President Wilson); a great dining hall with hammerhead beams, an organ, and stained glass; a refectory, a library, a lounge, gardens with ivies from abroad and in its wall architectural fragments from Oxford and Cambridge; a handsome house for the dean, and a suite for the master in residence. The detailing is continuously interesting, with humorous depiction of student life in the form of exterior gargoyles and grotesques, and caricatures of trustees carved on the dining hall hammer\u00ad heads. The principal components of the Graduate College are memorials to founders, benefactors or their relatives, and distingished graduates. Thomson College, the central quad\u00ad rangle, is a memorial to United States Senator John R. Thomson 1817 pro\u00ad vided by a bequest left by his widow, Mrs. J. R. Thomson Swann, the Graduate College's first benefactor. Procter Hall, the College's formal 224 THE GRADUATE SCHOOL dining hall and chief public room, ad\u00ad mired by experts in the field as a distin\u00ad guished example of collegiate gothic, was given by William Cooper Procter 1883 in memory of his parents. Pyne Tower, which contains the liv\u00ad ing quarters of the master in residence, was named for the donor, M. Taylor Pyne 1877, the chairman of the trus\u00ad tees' graduate school committee at the time the Graduate College was built. In the vaulted vestibule at the base of the tower there is a memorial to the Graduate College's first master in resi\u00ad dence, archaeologist Howard Crosby Butler 1892, in the form of a translation of a Greek inscription he discovered on the Syrian desert, carved beside a fire\u00ad place; I sojourned well, I journeyed well; and well I lie at rest. Pray for me. Wyman House, the residence of the dean of the Graduate School, was named for Isaac C. Wyman 1848, who left the bulk of his estate to the Univer\u00ad sity Graduate College. Between Procter Hall and Wyman House, a gateway opens into the Graduate College gardens, from which can be seen the heraldic sculptures and elaborate grotesques that decorate the west facade of Procter Hall. Their carv\u00ad ing, according to E. Baldwin Smith, then Howard Crosby Butler Professor of the History of Architecture, \"has more freedom, vigor, and originality than perhaps any other modern revival of the Gothic style.\" The 173-foot Cleveland Tower, which flanks the main entrance, was erected by public subscription of \"thousands of citizens of all parties in all walks and conditions of life from all parts of the United States\" as a memo\u00ad rial to President Grover Cleveland, who, following his retirement from public life, was a trustee of the Univer\u00ad sity and, as chairman of the trustees' graduate school committee, was deeply interested in the planning of the Graduate College. The carillon in the belfry of the tower was given in 1927 by the Class of 1892. A quadrangle known as the North Court was added, also in 1927, with a gift from William Cooper Procter and a grant from University funds. Two addi\u00ad tional quadrangles built northwest of the original group in 1963 were named for Procter and for three illustrious alumni of the Graduate School, the Compton brothers (q.v.). Designed by R. Tait McKenzie and given by William Cooper Procter, the bronze statue of Dean West on the upper terrace of the court of Thomson College was dedicated in the spring of 1928. Seated in the center of the origi\u00ad nal Graduate College buildings, the dean appears to be saying\u2014as one of his contemporaries suggested it was given to him to say, in the words of his favorite Latin author, Horace\u2014\"Exegi monumentum aere perennius\" (I have built a monument more enduring than bronze). John D. Davies Graduate School, The, was established in 1901, but its antecedents reach back almost to Princeton's beginnings. In co\u00ad lonial times some graduates returned to prepare for the ministry with the Col\u00ad lege's president. James Madison 1771, who remained at Princeton for six months after his graduation to read under President Witherspoon's guid\u00ad ance, was possibly the first Princeto- nian to pursue non-theological post\u00ad graduate study. He is sometimes called Princeton's first graduate student. Later the number of postgraduate stu\u00ad dents increased\u2014there were twenty- three in residence in 1823\u2014but their THE GRADUATE SCHOOL 225 work was informal and they were not candidates for degrees. President James McCosh began to lay the groundwork for the later devel\u00ad opment of the Graduate School shortly after his inauguration in 1868. Under his leadership in the 1870s, new profes\u00ad sorships and graduate fellowships were created and systematized programs of study leading to master's and doctor's degrees on examination were adopted. When he retired in 1888, seventy-eight graduate students were enrolled in programs in art and archaeology, as\u00ad tronomy, biology, classics, geology, mathematics, philosophy, and physics. Although McCosh began the trans\u00ad formation of the College into a univer\u00ad sity, the change was not formalized until the Sesquicentennial in 1896, when the trustees changed the name of the College of New Jersey to Princeton University. McCosh's successor, Presi\u00ad dent Patton, did little to further a graduate program, and during his ad\u00ad ministration efforts toward this end were led chiefly by Andrew Fleming West 1874 (q.v.), Giger Professor of Latin. As early as the Sesquicentennial, West began to advocate not only higher priority for graduate studies but also a college to house graduate students. (In the 1890s \"graduate college\" and \"graduate school\" were often used in\u00ad terchangeably, but, as the terms evolved in the following decade, the Graduate College became a place to live, the Graduate School a division of the Uni\u00ad versity's educational program.) On December 13, 1900, the trustees voted to establish a Graduate School and appointed West as the first dean. After a term's leave of absence, he took up his duties in the fall of 1901, and the Graduate School of Princeton Uni\u00ad versity became a reality. West worked diligently to achieve two primary goals. He insisted upon a high quality of graduate work in which the student could relate his specialty to more general learning in \"the house\u00ad hold of knowledge\" (to use West's phrase). He also sought the creation of the proper setting\u2014a Graduate Col\u00ad lege\u2014to help produce such rounded scholars. When Woodrow Wilson became president in 1902, he shared some of West's general concerns but not his overwhelming enthusaism for the Graduate College. Within a few years Wilson turned his efforts toward the preceptorial system and the quad plan, while West (who declined the presi\u00ad dency of M.I.T. in order to complete the Graduate College) devoted most of his considerable energy to seeing the College built. The experimental \"Graduate House\" at Merwick seemed a hopeful sign of what the Graduate College could become. But financial support was not found until Mrs. Josephine Thomson Swann, who died in 1906, left the University $275,000 for the con\u00ad struction of a graduate college. In April 1908, after two years of debate about the site, the trustees voted to build the College near Prospect. Wilson wanted the graduate students and undergraduates to live in close proximity, believing that strong mutual intellectual stimulation would result. West wanted the graduate students iso\u00ad lated from the distractions of under\u00ad graduate life, and he worked against the Prospect site. In May 1909, Wil\u00ad liam Cooper Procter 1883, one of West's alumni friends, offered Prince\u00ad ton $500,000 for the Graduate College, provided an equal amount was raised from other sources and some site, other than Prospect, selected that would be satisfactory to him. 226 THE GRADUATE SCHOOL For a year there was bitter con\u00ad troversy involving the entire univer\u00ad sity, a controversy over the site and the character of the Graduate College, but one which had its origin in an ongoing rivalry between two strong-willed per\u00ad sonalities, President Wilson and Dean West. Procter favored locating the Gradu\u00ad ate College near the golf links, and in October 1909 a majority of the trustees voted to accept his offer and his choice of site, much to Wilson's disappoint\u00ad ment. Thereafter, new proposals and counterproposals developed\u2014at one point Wilson proposed two graduate colleges, one on the main campus (to satisfy what he contended were Mrs. Swann's wishes), and one near the golf course. In February 1910, noting the unfavorable reception it was receiving from the president and his associates, Procter withdrew his offer. In May 1910, when West was on the verge of resigning as dean, Isaac Chauncey Wyman 1848 died, leaving an estate estimated at over two million dollars (but, it later developed, worth only $794,000), for the Graduate Col\u00ad lege, to be built as West desired. Proc\u00ad ter renewed his offer, and the trustees accepted it. Wilson, turning toward state and national politics, resigned the presidency of Princeton in October 1910. Construction of the Graduate College at the edge of the golf course began in May 1911, and it was formally dedicated on October 22, 1913. During the twenty-seven years that Dean West administered its affairs, the Graduate School grew steadily. In addi\u00ad tion to the fields covered in McCosh's day, graduate programs were now offered also in chemistry, economics, English, German, history, Oriental studies, politics, psychology, and Ro\u00ad mance languages, leading to A.M. and Ph.D. degrees and, after 1919, in ar\u00ad chitecture, leading to the M. F. A. (later to the degree of Master of Architecture or Master of Architecture and Urban Planning). A further gift from William Cooper Procter in 1927 provided an addition to the Graduate College, called North Court. West held that excellence could best be attained with a small number of well-qualified graduate students, and enrollment under him never exceeded 200\u2014the limit set by the trustees in 1922. In his last report, in 1928, he spoke with pride of the achievements of the School's graduates. At that time, he pointed out, former members of his \"society of scholars\" made up one- fourth of the Princeton faculty and were eagerly sought for academic posts elsewhere; and many others had gained notable positions in the professions, di\u00ad plomacy, research, and philanthropy. In the next quarter-century, under West's successors, physicist Augustus Trowbridge (1928 to 1933) and mathe\u00ad matician Luther P. Eisenhart (1933 to 1945), applications for admission rose, particularly in the sciences, stimulated by the creation of the University's Foundation for Scientific Research, and by the outstanding record Princeton Ph. D. s had made in winning National Research Council fellowships in math\u00ad ematics, physics, and chemistry. In the Trowbridge years, the trustees raised the enrollment limit to 250, and as de\u00ad mand increased under Dean Eisen\u00ad hart, almost all of the programs leading to terminal A.M. degrees were elimi\u00ad nated in order to make room for more Ph.D. candidates. Since then, except in Near Eastern Studies, the A.M. degree has been of\u00ad fered only as an incidental degree, available after completion of a portion THE GRADUATE SCHOOL 227 of the Ph.D. requirements. (The M.F.A. degree has continued to be of\u00ad fered in art and archaeology and in music, as have appropriate professional degrees at the master's level in ar\u00ad chitecture, engineering, public affairs, and urban planning.) Dean Hugh Stott Taylor's adminis\u00ad tration, from 1945 to 1958, was one of great growth. With the return of vet\u00ad erans after World War II, the trustees removed the limitation on enrollment, which mounted steadily, eventually reaching 660. The large number of married veterans needing accommoda\u00ad tions led to the opening of the Butler Tract Project, the Graduate School's first housing for married students. Existing student aid resources were in\u00ad creased by G.I. benefits; by corporate, government, and foundation gifts and grants; and by the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Program (q.v.), which orig\u00ad inated in Princeton. Fifth year pro\u00ad grams in engineering, which had been in effect since 1922, but outside Dean West's fold, were incorporated into the Graduate School for the first time, and new doctoral programs were adopted in aeronautical, chemical, civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering as well as in architecture, music, religion, and sociology. Expansion continued in the 1960s under physicist Donald Ross Hamilton, dean from 1958 to 1965, and under bi\u00ad ologist Colin S. Pittendrigh, who took over when Hamilton resigned because of ill health. A maginificent gift of $35 million for the Woodrow Wilson School permitted the appointment of addi\u00ad tional faculty and a marked increase in the number of graduate students pre\u00ad paring for careers in public and interna\u00ad tional affairs. In other areas, new Ph. D. programs were begun in anthropology, astrophysics, biochemical sciences, comparative literature, East Asian studies, and statistics, as well as in such interdisciplinary programs as the his\u00ad tory and philosophy of science. Applications for admission increased sharply, and after the successful launch\u00ad ing of Sputnik, federal funding for graduate fellowships increased substan\u00ad tially, particularly in science and en\u00ad gineering. Similar aid for students in the humanities and social sciences was provided in a number of ways, notably by the Ford Foundation's liberal financ\u00ad ing of the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Program and by federal fellowships provided by the National Defense Ed\u00ad ucation Act. Under a policy of con\u00ad trolled expansion, enrollment under Dean Hamilton reached 1,150. It con\u00ad tinued to grow under Dean Pitten\u00ad drigh, reaching 1,440 before he re\u00ad signed in 1969 to accept appointment as professor of biology at Stanford. Increased housing needs were filled, for single students by the construction in 1963 of the Procter and Compton Quadrangles, just west of the original Graduate College, and for a growing number of married students, by the erection in 1966 of the Lawrence Apartments. The rapid growth of the 1960s, which approached an enrollment of 1,500 by 1969, was followed by a period of con\u00ad solidation in the early 1970s, made necessary by financial strains on the university and a decline in fellowship support for graduate students available from outside sources. Under physicist Aaron Lemonick, who served as dean of the Graduate School from 1969 until his appointment as dean of the faculty in 1973, and Alvin B. Kernan, Professor of English, who served from 1973 to 1977, enrollment leveled off at about 1,400. As national demand for well qualified women and racial minority Ph. D. s 228 GREEK-LETTER FRATERNITIES continued to rise, two University deci\u00ad sions in the late 1960s significantly in\u00ad creased their number at Princeton. The first woman student had been admitted in 1961 under rules that lim\u00ad ited admission to those women for whom the Princeton Graduate School offered a practically unique opportu\u00ad nity. This criterion was used until 1968, when admission without regard to sex became the University's policy. There\u00ad after, the number of women increased steadily, and by 1976 enrollment of women graduate students reached 367. In the late 1960s a conscious effort was begun to increase the number of blacks and other minority groups en\u00ad rolled in the graduate school. Less than a decade later, in 1976, there were thirty-eight blacks and 185 members of other minority groups. In 1977 Nina G. Garsoian, formerly of Columbia University, accepted ap\u00ad pointment as professor of Byzantine and Armenian Studies and ninth dean of the Graduate School, the first woman to occupy that position. In national ratings of graduate pro\u00ad grams Princeton has always done very well. Of the twenty-six Princeton de\u00ad partments mentioned in a 1969 Ameri\u00ad can Council of Education study, twenty were ranked among the country's top ten departments in effectiveness of doc\u00ad toral programs, twelve were among the top three, and two were first. These findings reflect the advantages of the close association of small groups of stu\u00ad dents with distinguished departmental faculties\u2014from the beginning one of the great strengths of the Princeton Graduate School. Minor Myers, Jr. Greek-letter fraternities maintained a precarious existence in the College dur\u00ad ing the middle of the nineteenth cen\u00adtury. The first one made its appearance in 1843, and, at one time or another, twelve fraternities were represented by Princeton chapters\u2014Beta Theta Pi, Chi Phi, Chi Psi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Delta Phi, Delta Psi, Kappa Alpha, Phi Kappa Sigma, Sigma Chi, Sigma Phi, Theta Delta Chi, Zeta Psi. Fearing that the fraternities would undermine college discipline and prove injurious to the old American Whig and Cliosophic literary and debating socie\u00ad ties, the trustees and faculty, at the in\u00ad stance of President Maclean, adopted resolutions in 1855 requiring each en\u00ad tering student to sign a pledge that he would not join such an organization while in college. This pledge\u2014which, according to the catalogue, was still being required as late as 1939-1940\u2014 was as follows: . . . I pledge myself, without any mental reservation, that I will have no connection whatever with any se\u00ad cret society in this institution so long as I am a member of Princeton Uni\u00ad versity; it being understood that this promise has no reference to the American Whig and Cliosophic Societies. I also declare that I regard myself bound to keep this promise and on no account whatever to vio\u00ad late it. Nevertheless, some fraternities main\u00ad tained an illicit existence, and it was not until 1875 that decisive action by Presi\u00ad dent McCosh brought the dissolution of most of those still remaining, in spite of opposition from some New York alumni who sought unsuccessfully to persuade the trustees to remove the prohibition on fraternities. One or two seem to have lingered on surreptitiously until the early 1880s. Meanwhile, the forma\u00ad tion, with College approval, of \"select associations\" of students in local board-ASHBEL GREEN 229 inghouses marked the first stage in the development of what became a distinc\u00ad tive feature in undergraduate social life\u2014the eating clubs (q.v.). Green, Ashbel (1762-1848), eighth president of Princeton 1812-1822, and the second alumnus to serve in that post, was a native of Hanover, New Jer\u00ad sey. His father, Jacob Green, was a controversial and independent-minded Presbyterian minister and a trustee of Princeton. His mother, Elizabeth Pier- son Green, was the daughter of John Pierson, one of Princeton's original trustees. Green was educated at home by his father and at the age of sixteen began a three-year stint as a local schoolmaster. He entered Princeton in the junior class and graduated as class valedictorian in 1783. His valedictory address was delivered before George Washington and other members of the Continental Congress, then meeting in Princeton. Green must have impressed Presi\u00ad dent Witherspoon favorably, for he spent the two years after his graduation as a tutor in the College, and another one and a half years as professor of mathematics and natural philosophy. During this period Green married the first of his three wives, Elizabeth Stockton, daughter of a prominent Princeton family. Undecided about the choice of a career, Green sought advice from Samuel Stanhope Smith 1769, later his predecessor as president. \"Theology is not the road either to fame or wealth,\" Smith told Green. \"The law, in this country, leads to those ob\u00ad jects. But if you wish to do good, and prefer an approving conscience before all other considerations, I have no hesi\u00ad tation in saying you ought to preach the gospel.\" Green immediately decided to become a minister, studied with With\u00ad erspoon (whom he revered deeply and whose \"Life\" he later wrote), and in 1787 began an association with Phila\u00ad delphia's Second Presbyterian Church that would last until 1812. A medium-sized, stocky man of commanding presence, Green soon rose to a position of considerable prom\u00ad inence within his denomination. A long-term member of the Presbyterian General Assembly, he was its Stated Clerk from 1790 to 1803, and had the additional distinction of serving as chaplain to the United States Congress from 1792 to 1800. Green was noted for his energy and organizational powers; his interests and activities covered a wide area. But the two objects closest to his heart were missionary work and education. He was a member of the committee that drew up plans for the Princeton Theological Seminary, and he maintained a close association with that institution from its founding in 1812 until 1848. Green was equally concerned with the College, which he served as a trustee beginning in 1790. By the early 1800s it seemed to some that Princeton under President Smith was not producing enough Presbyterian ministers, was theologically suspect, and, worst of all, was the scene of con\u00ad stant student riot and dissipation. In 1812 Smith was eased out of this post, and Green assumed the presidency of the College. Green was fifty years old when he took up his new position. Most of his mature years had been spent in the successful service of his congregation and his denomination. It was as the stern but kindly pastor, rather than the educator, that Green approached his presidency. Rigorous disciplinary rules were introduced and a heavily religious tone soon pervaded the College. \"Dr. 230 JOHN CLEVE GREEN Smith's works have all been expelled, and others substituted in their room . . . ,\" one student reported to his father. \"There appears to subsist be\u00ad tween these ministers of Christ but little harmony or love.\" Green's efforts bore some fruit in the form of religious revivals among the students, and, for a short period, in relative peace. It is al\u00ad most impossible to evaluate Green's ef\u00ad fect in raising academic standards at Princeton. \"I fear it is an undeniable fact,\" he had reported to the trustees in 1813, \"that the majority of those who have received degrees with us, for a number of years past, could not possi\u00ad bly have translated their own diplomas into English.\" Many must have thought that Green had wrought a change for the better in Princeton, for despite some serious student riots, enrollments increased during his administration. Green's tenure as president ended in 1822. The immediate cause of his res\u00ad ignation appears to have been an effort by the trustees to ease Green's son Jacob out of the post of professor of nat\u00ad ural philosophy. The larger cause may well have been Green's involvement with the affairs of the Theological Seminary to the detriment of those of the College. Whatever the case, Green went on to a long and extremely in\u00ad fluential career as a prominent religious writer and journalist and a major force in the \"Old School\" wing of the Presby\u00ad terian Church. Green's administration has some\u00ad times been accounted a failure. In fact, the heavily authoritarian and evangelis\u00ad tic spirit that marked his regime would become characteristic of many Ameri\u00ad can colleges in the mid-nineteenth cen\u00ad tury. Ashbel Green was simply a Victo\u00ad rian of his time. James McLachlan Green, John Cleve (1800-1875) was the College's greatest benefactor during the presidency of James McCosh. By the time McCosh retired in 1888, Green and his residuary legatees had contributed \"to the good of the Col\u00ad lege,\" President McCosh said in his farewell report, \"upwards of a million and a half, perhaps two million dollars.\" Green was born in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, and was a member of the first class to enter what became the Lawrenceville School. He did not go to college, but entered the employ of New York merchants with extensive foreign trade. He spent ten years as supercargo of ships visiting South America and China, and by the time he was forty had acquired an ample fortune in the China trade, derived from the tea and textile business and, after the end of the East India Company's monopoly, from the opium trade. This fortune he enhanced by investments in railroads, whose div\u00ad idends often reached 15 percent. His three children having died young, he made substantial gifts to various philan\u00ad thropies. He was a principal benefactor of the Deaf and Dumb Asylum and the Home for Ruptured and Crippled in New York City, and of the Lawrence\u00ad ville School and the Princeton Theolog\u00ad ical Seminary, as well as of Princeton College. Green secured for the College in 1866 the land that now forms the north east corner of the main Campus. In 1870 he gave the College its first recita\u00ad tion building, named for his great- great-grandfather, John Dickinson, first president of the College. In 1873 he gave the College its first library building, named for his brother, Henry Woodhull Green 1820, Chancellor of New Jersey and a trustee, and the same year he also donated funds for a school of science, which was named for him. ARTHUR MAURICE GREENE, JR. 231 He endowed the Joseph Henry profes\u00ad sorship, and his legatees provided further funds for science and for civil engineering as well as for professor\u00ad ships in Latin and Greek. The benefac\u00ad tions from his estate continued into the 1890s and included the erection of the College's first chemical laboratory building at the corner of Nassau Street and Washington Road in 1891. After the John C. Green School of Science burned down in 1928, the En\u00ad gineering Building that had just been completed on Washington Road was named for Green; in 1962 when the School of Engineering moved into the new Engineering Quadrangle, its old building was assigned to other depart\u00ad ments and called Green Hall. A portrait of Green hangs in the Convocation Room of the Engineering Quadrangle. Green Hall is named for the founder of the School of Science, John C. Green (q.v.). Built in 1927 from the design of Charles Z. Klauder, it was the home of the School of Engineering until 1963 when, with the completion of the En\u00ad gineering Quadrangle, it was re\u00ad designed by Francis W. Roudebush '22 for the use of the Departments of Psy\u00ad chology and Sociology, previously lo\u00ad cated in Eno and 1879 Halls. The new design entailed extensive remodeling and modernization, made possible by a National Science Founda\u00ad tion grant of $500,000 and matching University funds. A third story and a\u00b7 new wing were added and new floors were constructed within the old high- ceilinged laboratories, supplying con\u00ad siderably expanded library, classroom, office, and laboratory space. Also pro\u00ad vided were a vivarium, a small an\u00ad thropology museum, a computer room, and a faculty lounge, named for Her\u00adbert S. Langfeld, a former psychology department chairman. Greene, Arthur Maurice, Jr. (1872- 1953), was the principal organizer of the School of Engineering and served as its first dean. He had previously taught at the University of Pennsylva\u00ad nia (his alma mater), Drexel Institute of Technology, the University of Mis\u00ad souri, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Insti\u00ad tute. He accepted the call to Princeton primarily because of its traditional em\u00ad phasis on liberal arts courses as integral parts of an engineering curriculum. \"The imagination of the engineer,\" he held, \"should be equal to that of the novelist, the artist, the poet, or the preacher, for in many respects the work of all these creators is the same.\" When Greene came in 1922 to organ\u00ad ize the newly formed School of En\u00ad gineering, he served not only as dean but as chairman of the new Department of Mechanical Engineering. As the only professor in that department, he car\u00ad ried a teaching load that would have been the despair of many younger col\u00ad leagues. An undergraduate said in the Alumni Weekly that the only exercise Greene could find time for was that he got hurrying from one engagement to another, and that the best one could hope for was a fleeting glimpse of him leaving his class in hydraulics for an hour in his office before returning for another class in thermodynamics. A born teacher and tireless worker, he wrote ten textbooks, served as pres\u00ad ident of the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education, and de\u00ad signed the campus power plants at Mis\u00ad souri, Rensselaer, and Princeton. Following his formal retirement in 1940, which climaxed a teaching career of almost half a century, Dean Greene continued to give a graduate course in 232 WILLIAM STRYKER GUMMERE engineering economics through 1952, thus achieving his ambition to teach until he was eighty. Gummere, William Stryker 1870 (1852-1933), was captain of the Prince\u00ad ton team that met Rutgers in 1869 in the first intercollegiate football game played in America. Gummere himself took greater pride in having been the first player to use the hook-slide in baseball\u2014in an exhi\u00ad bition game between Princeton and the Philadelphia Athletics in the spring of 1870. Gummere, a great center fielder, got to first on a base hit and started to steal second. On the way down he saw that the catcher's throw would get to the bag ahead of him. Knowing that the catcher always threw the ball shoulder high and that the second baseman, Al Reach (later a manufacturer of sporting goods), invariably turned around to tag the runner standing up, Gummere threw himself feet first at the bag and buried his face in his right arm for pro\u00ad tection. When the second baseman turned to tag him, he discovered Gummere stretched out under his feet, safely out of reach. \"What kind of a damned fool trick is that?\" Reach demanded. \"That,\" said Gummere, smiling as he got up and dusted himself off, \"is a de\u00ad vice to evade being put out when run\u00ad ning bases.\" After graduating from Princeton in 1870 at the age of eighteen, Gummere studied law in his father's office in Tren\u00ad ton and was admitted to the bar in 1873. In the Class of 1870's twentieth reunion book, Gummere said he was a Republican. \"Consequently,\" he added, \"I have never held office. Repub\u00ad licans don't as a usual thing hold office in New Jersey.\" This pessimism proved premature. Five years later a Demo\u00adcratic governor appointed Gummere to the Supreme Court of New Jersey, and six years after that a Republican governor appointed him Chief Justice, a position he held until his death thirty-two years later. When he died at the age of 80, a Democratic governor, echoing the tributes of other judges, said that New Jersey had lost one of its greatest jurists and America one of its keenest legal minds, and that the \"treasure store of legal opinion\" that Gummere had left would be vital for generations \"long after most of us are forgotten.\" Guyot, Arnold [Henri] (1807-1884), who in 1855 began the first systematic instruction in geology at Princeton, was born at Boudevilliers near Neuchatel, Switzerland. He obtained his doctoral degree at Berlin with a dissertation on \"Natural Classification of Lakes.\" Be\u00ad tween 1839 and 1848 he taught physical geography and history at the Academy of Neuchatel. In 1848 the Academy was closed, and at the suggestion of his friend Louis Agassiz, he came to the United States. He gave a series of lec\u00ad tures at the Lowell Institute in Boston entitled \"The Earth and Man,\" which became the basis for a highly successful text of the same name, recently re\u00ad printed (1971) by the Arno Press. In 1854 he was appointed Professor of Geology and Physical Geography at the College of New Jersey and the follow\u00ad ing year began what is now the De\u00ad partment of Geological and Geophysi\u00ad cal Sciences. Guyot's interests were in glaciology, physical geography, meteor\u00ad ology, and cartography. His early studies on the flow of ice and the distri\u00ad bution of glacial erratics in Switzerland served to underpin the theory of glacia- tion that had been advanced and cham\u00ad pioned by his close associate Agassiz. GUYOT HALL 233 In this country his main activities fo\u00ad cused on hypsometric measurements of the eastern mountains from New Eng\u00ad land to North Carolina, on meteorol\u00ad ogy, and on the reform of geographic teaching in colleges and secondary schools. He was intimately involved in the formative years of weather forecasting in the United States and was responsi\u00ad ble for selecting and equipping some fifty meteorological observation stations for the network developed through the efforts of Joseph Henry for the Smith\u00ad sonian Institution. He spent many summers making barometric meas\u00ad urements to determine mountain ele\u00ad vations from Mt. Katahdin in Maine to Mt. Oglethorpe in Georgia along what is now the Appalachian Trail. He used these occasions as field exercises in which Princeton students could prac\u00ad tice barometric techniques, an early example of the long tradition of Princeton geology to include students in faculty field research as part of their educational experience. Guyot's many texts, geographic at\u00ad lases, and wall charts continued to be pubished long after his death. In 1856 he founded what is now the Princeton Museum of Natural History and continued to contribute specimens to it until his death at the age of 78. He was the first incumbent of the Blair Pro\u00ad fessorship of Geology, the second old\u00ad est endowed chair at Princeton. Three Mt. Guyots\u2014in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, on the North Carolina-Tennessee line in the Great Smoky Mountains, and the Colorado Rockies\u2014were named in his honor, as were the Guyot Glacier in southeastern Alaska and the Guyot Crater on the moon. The great flat-topped seamounts that characterize many parts of the ocean floor were named \"guyots\" in his honor by Harry H. Hess. And of course there is Guyot Hall. Few memorabilia remain of Guyot's life. At Princeton there are forty-six cloth wall hangings that he used for il\u00ad lustrative materials in his classroom. In Guyot Hall is the field toilet kit he car\u00ad ried on his mountain explorations. In Guyot Hall also are his handwritten labels of the glacial erratic stones he collected in the 1840s in Switzerland, the specimens themselves being long gone. In front of Nassau Hall stands the Guyot boulder, a glacial erratic given to Princeton by Arnold Guyot's former students at the Academy of Neuchatel. Sheldon Judson Guyot Hall, named for Princeton's first professor of geology and geography, Arnold Guyot (q.v.), was given to the University by the mother of Cleveland H. Dodge 1879. In planning what was to become the home of the biology and geology departments, Professor Wil\u00ad liam Berryman Scott, then chairman of both, sent out a faculty committee to study other important American labora\u00ad tory buildings. The floor plans, worked out by the departments concerned and drawn up by Professor Gilbert Van In- gen, were accepted by the architects Parrish and Schroeder with scarcely any change. \"Being, thus, practically designed by the men who were to use it,\" Professor Scott said thirty years after the building's completion in 1909, \"Guyot Hall has always been a very satisfactory place in which to work.\" The building contained about two acres of floor space and some 100 rooms. The ground floor was assigned to the Natural History Museum so that it might attract the attention of people on their way to lecture-laboratory rooms and offices on other floors. On 234 GYMNASTICS the second floor a large central reading room housed the two departmental li\u00ad braries; they eventually outgrew this space and were separated. In exterior design, Guyot followed the Tudor Gothic style inaugurated in Blair and Little Halls, but with the red brick and limestone trim first used in Seventy-nine Hall. Added as an extra Gothic feature, in keeping with Guyot s purpose, were many extinct and living animals and plants represented by stone carvings on the molding around the building\u2014some 200 of them, stu\u00ad dents discovered in a survey they made in the 1950s. These gargoyle-like or\u00ad naments were created in the studio of Gutzon Borglum, sculptor of the Mount Rushmore presidential por\u00ad traits, in South Dakota. Several additions were made to Guyot in the 1960s to accommodate the growth of the two departments. The George M. Moffett Biological Labora\u00ad tory was built in I960 with funds pro\u00ad vided by the Whitehall Foundation, es\u00ad tablished by George M. Moffett '04 and the National Institutes of Health. That same year a one-story addition was made for geology, and in 1964 a larger three-story addition for geochemistry and geophysics was built with help from the National Science Foundation. All three additions were designed by O'Connor and Kilham. NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM The Natural History Museum, founded in 1856 by Arnold Guyot, had previously been housed in Nassau Hall in what is now the Faculty Room; it ex\u00ad panded rapidly after the completion of Guyot Hall. The museum possesses several hundred thousand geological, biological, and archaeological speci\u00ad mens. The mineralogical collections contain a sample of almost every avail\u00adable mineral and gem in the world. Fossil vertebrates brought back by Princeton scientific expeditions to the Far West, Patagonia, and elsewhere are internationally famous. There is also an excellent collection of fossil fishes, re\u00ad covered in 1946 from rocks exposed by the excavation for Firestone Library. Museum specimens of special interest include skeletons of the sabre-toothed tiger, mastodon, three-toed horse, and giant pig, and the fossil of an Eocene perch preserved in the act of trying to swallow a herring. Gymnastics, one of Princeton's oldest athletic activities, began as an informal exercise in the 1830s, and as an organ\u00ad ized sport with the completion of Bonner-Marquand Gymnasium in 1870 and the appointment of George Goldie as its director. Goldie was a handsome Scot, with a full beard and great biceps; according to Professor Allan Marquand, one of his aptest pupils, \"his skill in gymnastics, his cheerful temper, and his high character made him justly popular.\" Under Goldie's influence, gymnas\u00ad tics became a prominent intramural activity which every year reached its climax in a Commencement exhibition. In the early 1890s Princeton gymnasts began to give outside exhibitions at Mount Holly, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, and a few years later took part in the first annual Yale- Princeton exhibition, which eventually became competitive. Additional meets were scheduled with other colleges and, with the establishment in 1900 of championship meets by the newly- formed Intercollegiate Gymnastics As\u00ad sociation, the era of competitive inter\u00ad collegiate gymnastics began. Goldie retired in 1911, and Goldie Field was named in his honor. Other WALTER PHELPS HALL 235 gymnastic teachers served for brief pe\u00ad riods until 1925 when Richard Swinner- ton began a term as coach which lasted until the outbreak of World War II. In the forty-year period before the Second World War, Princeton gymnas\u00ad tic teams were frequently among the best in the East and in five years\u2014 1908, 1916, 1927, 1931, and 1937\u2014 they were the best. Three Princetonians won the eastern Intercollegiate all-round championship: Ernest W. Mecabe '08 in his sopho\u00ad more and senior years, Jerome R. Wiss '17 in his sophomore and junior years, and Robley D. Snively, Jr. '28 in his sophomore year. Two others excelled in two individual events: Charles E. Claggett '31 was champion on the side horse in his junior and senior years and on the rings in his senior year. Thomas Gucker III '37 set a world's record by completing the twenty-foot rope climb in 3.8 seconds in his junior year, and he also won the side horse championship in his junior and senior years. Other Princetonians who won indi\u00ad vidual eastern intercollegiate cham\u00ad pionships rings; William A. Coulter 03, Charles W. Holzhauer 05, and Frank C. Roberts Jr. 16, horizontal bar; Wolfgang S. Schwabacher '18 and Philip B. Townley '20, club swinging; David S. Sheldon '23, side horse (in 1922 and 1923); Barent Robley Snively, Jr. '28, flying rings (in 1927 and 1928); Richard D. Wallace '34 and George Harrison Houston, Jr. '37, rope climb; Carl Ferenbach II '37, flying rings. Gymnastics at Princeton ceased dur\u00ad ing the Second World War and was not revived again until the founding of a Gymnastics Club in 1967 and the be\u00ad ginning of an annual Ivy League Gym\u00ad nastics Meet in 1968. A women's gym\u00ad nastic team began competition in 1974; it was coached by Meredith Dean Baker until 1976 when Ute Alt was appointed women's coach at the same time that her husband J. Douglas Alt was made men's coach. In 1977, Vickie Mayer '80 placed second in the competition for the women's Ivy League all-round championship. Hall, Walter Phelps (1884-1962) was probably the most popular teacher of Princeton undergraduates in the first half of this century. He was a legend in his own lifetime, and, as Professor Joseph R. Strayer said, his death marked the end of an era on the Princeton Campus. A graduate of Yale (1906) and Co\u00ad lumbia (Ph.D. 1912), he came to Princeton as a history instructor in 1913, at the age of twenty-nine. Soon his name began to appear among the favorite teachers selected in the annual senior poll; when he retired thirty-nine years later as Dodge Professor of His\u00ad tory, he had been first more often than any other member of the Faculty in his time. For most of his career he lectured to sophomores on modern European his\u00ad tory. His course was a prerequisite for history majors, and it was the stimulus of his teaching that attracted many stu\u00ad dents into that department and made it one of the largest in the University. He was, in Professor Strayer's words, \"a powerful teacher,\" whose \"strength lay . . . in a rare ability to dramatize human events, however remote, and to kindle the imaginations of youthful minds.\" He was a favorite subject in the Seniors' Faculty Song; their changing 236 WALTER PHELPS HALL verses about him provide a running ac\u00ad count of his life and habits. His bulldog, \"Eli,\" was a frequent guest in the preceptorials he conducted during his bachelor days in 363 Cuyler Hall. Sometimes, to make a new group of preceptees feel at home, he would grab a sword from the wall and fling it into the air, and Eli would catch it in his mouth. The students were properly impressed, but they couldn't resist the temptation to suggest in the Faculty Song, that \"if he had any dope at all\", He'd shoot that darned New Haven pup, And bring a Princeton Tiger up. Hall was married to Margaret Nixon by President Hibben in 1923. After their marriage, the Halls lived in the country for a while, and he was fre\u00ad quently seen driving to the Campus with a horse and carriage. \"Keeps his flivver in a stall,\" the seniors sang that year, Buzzes in from. Kingston way In a \"car\" that runs on hay. Another verse of the Faculty Song described Hall's annual lecture on his favorite historical character: On Garibaldi's life and death He yells himself quite out of breath. A handsome, stockily built man, giv\u00ad en to fancy vests, knickerbockers, and flowing ties, Hall usually carried a walking stick. Never without a pipe, he seemed to spend more time in precep\u00ad torials filling it than smoking it. Be\u00ad cause he used a hearing aid, he was called \"Buzzer.\" Walter Hall was remarkable in that the influence he exerted on under\u00ad graduates when he was young con\u00ad tinued undiminished as the gap in their ages widened, right up to his retire\u00ad ment. The basic reasons for this phenomenon have been well described by Professor Strayer, who was Buzzer's student, colleague, and, finally, his de\u00ad partmental chairman: . . . All human activity, every person he met, engaged him. In spite of per\u00ad sonal affliction and of increasing deafness, he never burdened others with his own troubles. He had the great gift of making other people's in\u00ad terests his own. He gave himself freely, and he received in return the affection of his colleagues and of gen\u00ad eration after generation of under\u00ad graduates. His unorthodox methods of lecturing were legendary. He frequently sat on the desk and sometimes stood on it. Stories were handed down from class to class about celebrated examples of his uninhibited spontaneity. One re\u00ad counted the time he lectured in his underwear. The explanation was simple enough. He had been drenched walk\u00ad ing to McCosh in a driving rain; rather than call off the lecture or take the risk of catching cold, he peeled off all of his outer garments and held forth in his underwear. Another was about the dramatic way he roused a sleeping un\u00ad dergraduate in one of his 7:40 A.M. lec\u00ad tures. Suspecting that the student had been up all night in New York and had returned on the milk train, Hall quietly walked to the dozer's side, and with a broad grin shouted, as only Buzzer could shout, \"Princeton Junction, change for Princeton!\" So many students and faculty wanted to attend his last lecture the year he re\u00ad tired, 1952, that it had to be shifted from McCosh to Alexander Hall. In his concluding words he told his students to rise above their fears and anxieties ELMORE HARRIS HARBISON 237 and to \"keep a merry heart.\" A six- piece band led the audience in singing \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow,\" and he was given a seven-foot scroll with the signatures of undergraduate contrib\u00ad utors to a fund in his honor, later en\u00ad larged by alumni gifts. This fund was to be used for a senior thesis prize in European history and for an annual lec\u00ad ture to be given by Buzzer \"as long as he felt like it.\" He gave the lecture every year up to 1962 when he died, two days before his 78th birthday. Recalling Buzzer's admonition to his students, Professor Strayer observed: \"No man ever took his own advice bet\u00ad ter. To the very end, and for the lasting good of all those who knew him, Walter Hall did keep a 'merry heart. Hamilton Hall, one of the smallest Gothic dormitories, and one of the most charming, was designed by Day and Klauder and built in 1911 with funds donated by the Classes of 1884 and 1885. It commemorates John Hamilton, president of the provincial council and acting governor of the Prov\u00ad ince of New Jersey who granted the first charter of the College of New Jer\u00ad sey on October 22, 1746, and thus, as reads the inscription on the limestone tablet in the low archway near Univer\u00ad sity Place, \"in the name of the King gave being to Princeton University.\" Harbison, Elmore Harris (1907-1964), Henry Charles Lea Professor of His\u00ad tory, was valedictorian and an outstand\u00ad ing member of the class of 1928. He not only won highest honors in history, but also was Triangle Club president, Phi Beta Kappa secretary, and a Philadel- phian Society cabinet member. He did his graduate work at Harvard, where he took his Ph.D. in 1938 with a disserta\u00ad tion which, as Rival Ambassadors in the Court of Queen Mary, later received the American Historical Association's Adams Prize. \"Jinks,\" as he was affec\u00ad tionately known, returned to Princeton as instructor in 1933, and continued to serve the University until his death thirty-one years later. He was, in the words of his friend and colleague, Professor Joseph R. Strayer, \"a profoundly religious man, a learned and honest scholar\" who \"wres\u00ad tled all his life with the problem of rec\u00ad onciling the apparent meaninglessness of history with the Providence of God.\" His struggle with this seeming paradox is clearly seen in his two most influen\u00ad tial works, The Christian Schohr in the Age of the Reformation and a collection of his essays on Christianity and His\u00ad tory. These books reveal his lucid ex\u00ad pression, his subtle humor, his rejec\u00ad tion of both dogmatism and skepticism, and, above all, \"his profound conviction that, in spite of all appearances, there is no contradiction between Christian faith and historical reason.\" In the introduction to a collection of essays published as a memorial to Har\u00ad bison, he was described by two of his former students, Professors Theodore K. Rabb and Jerrold E. Seigel, as a rare example of the teacher \"able to com\u00ad bine teaching, scholarship, and per\u00ad sonal conviction so that each grows out of the other.\" His faith, and \"the hu\u00ad manity of his attitude\" toward that faith, they say, \"ensured that his influ\u00ad ence extended to colleagues and stu\u00ad dents who had spiritual commitments different from his own.\" Harbison's convictions and his rea\u00ad soned way of expressing them made him an effective committee member and trustee. Besides service on faculty committees, for which he was in fre\u00ad quent demand, he was chairman of the 1949 President's Committee on Stu-238 JOHN MARSHALL HARLAN dent-Faculty Relations and for twelve years chairman of the Graduate Board of Trustees of the Student Christian Association. In addition, he was a fel\u00ad low of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the National Coun\u00ad cil on Religion in Higher Education, a trustee of Princeton Theological Semi\u00ad nary and of Lawrenceville School, and an elder of the Second Presbyterian Church of Princeton. He was also a trustee of the Danforth Foundation and helped establish its annual award for gifted college teaching in 1962. After his death the foundation named this award in his honor. At their meeting following his death, the faculty paid him this tribute: Jinks raised important questions in his writing; his great gift as a teacher was to make his students raise impor\u00ad tant questions in their turn. He was a master of the Socratic method, and he could make it effective at all levels, from a freshman class to a graduate seminar. Like Socrates, he made his points with wit as well as with logic. His lectures were a joy to hear, and his dryly humorous criti\u00ad cisms were memorable. His precepts reached the level of dialogue of which Woodrow Wilson dreamed. As for graduate students, in case after case men who came to Princeton to specialize in other fields found them\u00ad selves writing theses in Renaissance or Reformation history under Jinks. Knowing that they were to be teachers themselves, they were ir\u00ad resistibly attracted to a master of the art. In the long run, this will be Jinks's most important legacy. The next generation will revise his ideas about university organization, and rewrite his essays on Christianity and history\u2014for this is the nature of aca\u00ad demic life. But the men of the next generation who do this will be, in great part, men who studied under Jinks. Through his students and his students' students, his ideas will live and his influence endure far beyond the end of our days. Harlan, John Marshall '20 (1899-1971), was the eighth Princeton graduate to serve as Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Public service was a hallmark of his family. His Quaker forebear, George Harlan, came to America from Dur\u00ad ham, England, in 1687 and eight years later became governor of Delaware. His great-grandfather James Harlan was attorney general of Kentucky and a United States congressman from that state in the 1830s. His grandfather, for whom he was named, served from 1877 to 1911 as a Justice of the Su\u00ad preme Court. He is best remembered as the sole dissenter from the Court's 1896 declaration of the so-called \"sepa\u00ad rate but equal\" doctrine in defense of racial segregation, which he denounced because, he said, \"our Constitution is color-blind and neither knows nor tol\u00ad erates classes among citizens.\" An un\u00ad cle, Richard D. Harlan 1881, the first Princetonian in the family, was presi\u00ad dent of Lake Forest College, and another uncle, James S. Harlan 1883, was attorney general of Puerto Rico. His father, John Maynard Harlan 1884, practiced law and served as a city al\u00ad derman in Chicago. John Harlan '20 was outstanding in the student life of his generation, serv\u00ad ing as chairman of The Daily Prince\u00ad tonian, chairman of the Senior Council, and president of his class in junior and senior years. After graduating with honors in 1920, he spent three years as JOHN MARSHALL HARLAN 239 a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, taking an A. B. with a \"first\" in jurisprudence in 1923. On his return from England, he began work with one of the nation's leading law firms while studying at the New York Law School. He earned his LL. B. in 1924, was admitted to the New York bar in 1925, and became a partner in his firm in 1931. In the late 1920s, as special assistant attorney gen\u00ad eral of New York state, he investigated the Queens County sewer scandals and helped convict a former Queens borough president of conspiracy. In 1940 he and a partner represented the New York Board of Higher Education in its unsuccessful attempt to retain Bertrand Russell on the faculty of the City College of New York. During World War II he served as a colonel in the United States Army Air Force, in charge of the Operations Analysis Section of the Eighth Bomber Command in England. He was awarded the American Legion of Merit and the Belgian and French Croix de Guerre. In the early 1950s, as chief counsel for the newly created New York State Crime Commission, Harlan helped in\u00ad vestigate waterfront rackets in New York City and illegal gambling activities in several other communities. Later, he was one of four attorneys who success\u00ad fully defended several members of the duPont family in a federal antitrust suit. On nomination of President Eisen\u00ad hower, he became a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in March 1954 and as\u00ad sociate justice of the Supreme Court a year later. Harlan was called a \"lawyer's judge\" as well as a \"judge's judge.\" His opin\u00ad ions were so closely reasoned and so clearly written that lawyers often turned to him first for a succinct, fair statement of the issues. In reviewing his career, newspapers spoke of him as the court's \"conservative conscience.\" He was a strong believer in states' rights and an ardent defender of the rights of the individual. When the Court laid down its one-man, one-vote rule for state legislatures in 1964 he dis\u00ad sented, because he believed the vitality of the American political system was weakened by reliance on the judiciary for political reform; \"the Constitution,\" he said, \"is not a panacea for every blot upon the public welfare.\" But he fre\u00ad quently sided with the liberals and sometimes wrote the majority opinion for them. In 1955 he joined in the unan\u00ad imous opinion directing the district courts to take such action as was neces\u00ad sary to bring about, \"with all deliberate speed,\" the end of racial segregation in the public schools, which the Court had declared unconstitutional the previous year. In 1971 he wrote the majority opinion that found that wearing, in a courthouse corridor, a jacket bearing an obscene protest against the draft was constitutionally protected free speech. Harlan was admired by his associates for his integrity, his modesty, his gentle humor and, in his last years (when he wrote some of his most notable opin\u00ad ions), for the courage with which he met the challenge of seriously failing eyesight. Among the many tributes paid him after his death, at the age of seventy-two, was one by one of his first law clerks, Harvard Law School Profes\u00ad sor Paul M. Bator (Princeton class of 1951), who said in part: The private virtues\u2014love of truth; kindness; respect for others; the kind of decency and straightforwardness which only a firm self-respect can produce; an utter honesty and 240 GEORGE McLEAN HARPER simplicity of spirit, combined with what the Psalmist cried out for, a heart of flesh rather than a heart of stone\u2014these were the qualities that transfigured Justice Harlan's public acts. . . . Nothing is more fashionable in our society than to serve the cause of democracy by keeping a jealous scrutiny lest others exceed their power. Nothing is less common than one who is equally scrupulous about his own. Justice Harlan was one of these rare public men. For him fidel\u00ad ity to law was fidelity to the whole law, every day and not every other day, fidelity not only to those rules which define other people's power but also those which limited his own. . . . Maybe his most enduring legacy will be this, that when the dark night of cynicism and hopelessness is on us, we can say, yes, fidelity to law is possible, is worthwhile, is real. Harper, George McLean 1884 (1863- 1947), a leading Wordsworth scholar and first Woodrow Wilson Professor of Literature, grew up in Shippensburg, Pennsylvania. His fellow-townsman, Robert Bridges 1879, encouraged him to come to Princeton, and later intro\u00ad duced him to Woodrow Wilson 1879, who became a life-long friend. In college Harper was one of the most studious members of his class and, his classmates thought, one of the hap\u00ad piest and most exuberant. He won prizes for oratory in Whig Hall, and was co-managing editor of the Nassau Literary Magazine. In the fall of his senior year, he was instrumental in bringing Matthew Arnold to Princeton on his first lecture tour of the United States. \"I got in correspondence with his lecture bureau,\" Harper later re\u00ad called, \"secured the Second Presbyte\u00adrian Church as an auditorium, adver\u00ad tised the event, and persuaded some of my classmates to serve with me as ushers.\" Arnold was to be the guest of Dr. McCosh. But his acceptance of a railroad official's last-minute offer to have an express train make a special stop for him at Princeton Junction resulted in Arnold's arriving at Pros\u00ad pect from the Junction in a farmer's haywagon just as McCosh's coachman returned from the Princeton station with an empty coach. \"Despite this in\u00ad auspicious arrival,\" Harper reported, \"the lecture was a great success.\" After graduation Harper spent sev\u00ad eral years abroad in study and travel and in 1887 got a job through Robert Bridges, as assistant editor ofScribner's Magazine. Two years later he was called back to Princeton as instructor in French. He became Woodhull Profes\u00ad sor of Romance Languages at age thirty in 1894, and in 1900, when Bliss Perry left to become editor of the Athntic Monthly, was appointed to succeed him as Holmes Professor of Belles Lettres in the Department of English. Writing to his classmates about this time, Harper said he had helped, he believed, \"to make French respected and hard to pass.\" His hope for Princeton was that it might be \"the hardest University in the land to enter and remain in, and the pleasantest for real scholars.\" He also wished that \"we had more poor men here, men prepared in the free public schools.\" HARPER AND WILSON Harper was one of Woodrow Wil\u00ad son's closest friends, and also one of the first to greet the Wilson family when Wilson joined the faculty in 1890. Harper was then a bachelor and the Wilsons frequently entertained him at Sunday dinner, afterwards listening to GEORGE McLEAN HARPER 241 his talk about poetry. Wilson, who once said he believed the best political thought was to be found in poetry, was particularly fond of Harper's hero, Wil\u00ad liam Wordsworth. In 1895 Harper married Belle Westcott, sister the classicist, John Howell Westcott. The Harpers con\u00ad tinued to enjoy a close relationship with the Wilson family after Wilson became president of the University. Once, however, in a faculty meeting, their friendship was badly strained. At the end of a long speech by Wilson, Harper rose and said, \"We have had enough of this quibbling. Let us get on with the business.\" Wilson flared up and gave Harper a verbal scorching, which hurt his feelings. As he turned into his house, walking home after the meeting, Harper felt a hand on his shoulder and heard Wilson say, \"Don't let this little spat spoil our friendship.\" The two friends made up and never referred to the quarrel again. \"How many a friend Wilson would have kept whom he lost in the two great controversies of his career,\" Harper observed in recount\u00ad ing this incident, \"if he had made such a brotherly gesture and spoken such reconciling words.\" In the presidential campaign of 1912 the Harper family was invited to join the Wilsons in receiving the election returns. They attended the inaugura\u00ad tion and were afterwards week-end guests at the White House. On Sun\u00ad day afternoon, Harper later re\u00ad counted, they all sat on a rug before an open wood fire, repeating some of their favorite passages of poetry. Harper edited a volume of President Wilson's addresses in 1918. When the Woodrow Wilson Professorship of Lit\u00ad erature was founded in 1926 by Edward W. Bok \"to commemorate Wilson's mastery of spoken and written Eng\u00adlish,\" Harper was unanimously chosen to be its first occupant. BIOGRAPHY OF WOBDSWORTH Harper's two-volume biography, William Wordsworth, His Life, Works, and Influence (1916), established him as a leading Wordsworth scholar. Pre\u00ad vious in Harper's view, had romantic and insubordinate youth, when he was \"burning with zeal for his fellow men and with the fire of a generous philoso\u00ad phy,\" and had given disproportionate prominence to his old age, \"when his personal and literary adventures were at an end, and he had given up his gal\u00ad lant struggle on behalf of equality and simplicity.\" Along with Professor Emile Legouis of the Sorbonne, Harper had discov\u00ad ered the facts concerning Wordsworth's natural French daughter, Caroline, by Annette Vallon, and in his biography had quoted extensively from a neg\u00ad lected collection of letters in the British Museum from Dorothy Wordsworth, the poet's sister, which contained fre\u00ad quent references to Caroline and to her approaching marriage. In 1917, while serving as an orderly in the American Hospital at Neuilly, France, Harper continued his re\u00ad searches in the archives of Orleans and of the Prefecture of the Seine in Paris, where he found a record of the child's baptism and a certificate of her mar\u00ad riage which noted that she was the \"daughter of William Wordsworth, landowner, residing at Grasmere, Kendal, in the county of Westmorland, England. ...\" Having discovered the official re\u00ad cords of Caroline's birth and marriage as well as other items about her mother's family, Harper decided \"to give them as simply and correctly as 242 EDMUND NEWTON HARVEY possible\" in a little book, Wordsworth's French Daughter, published by Prince\u00ad ton University Press in 1921. \"I have made no attempt to deny that the origin of all this trouble was a wrong,\" Harper wrote, \"but the unusual difficulties that stood in the way of a legal marriage be\u00ad tween William Wordsworth fa Protes\u00ad Vallon and Royalist] should be and will be remembered.\" Harper's discovery created a great stir in England and in America and in\u00ad evitably found its way into the seniors' Faculty Song: Harper went to France to get The red-hot dope on dear Annette; And there performed a deed of note, Revealing Wordsworth's one wild oat. One of his students, Thomas S. Matthews '22, said of Harper in the classroom: . . . He was a quiet teacher, on the dry side, yet quite incapable of irony or sarcasm; an open and guileless ex\u00ad pectancy was his natural frame of mind. Before you had been long in his class you became aware that he was not only giving you the benefit of the doubt but confidently trusting that you might, at any moment, tell him something not only original but true. And that he would be grateful for it, but not at all surprised. Harper was a Socialist and once ran, unsuccessfully, for mayor of the Borough of Princeton on the Socialist ticket, the only man ever to do so. A friend of Norman Thomas 05, in 1940 he joined Thomas in expressing regret in letters to the Alumni Weekly that there were then no Negro students at Princeton. He died of a heart attack on July 14, 1947, while sitting on the porch of his house on Mercer Street. He had just returned from taking his wife out to lunch to celebrate Bastille Day. Professor Harper is memoralized by a graduate fellowship in English. Harvey, Edmund Newton (1887-1959), who was generally recognized as the world's leading authority on biolumi- nescence, began his investigations in biology as a boy in Germantown, Penn\u00ad sylvania, collecting \"every conceivable natural object,\" as he later recalled, in\u00ad cluding \"frogs in the family bathtub to lay eggs in the spring.\" At the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a B. S. degree in 1909, he continued his enthusiastic pursuit of science. By the time he began graduate work in zoology at Co\u00ad lumbia University, he had already par\u00ad ticipated in expeditions to Europe to collect alpine plants and to British Co\u00ad lumbia to study ecology, won two sci\u00ad entific prizes, and worked for a summer at marine biological laboratories at Tor- tugas, Florida, and Woods Hole, Mas\u00ad sachusetts, where his observations of sea urchin eggs led to his first publica\u00ad tion. He had also become increasingly interested in the relatively new field of cellular physiology and had decided to make laboratory experimentation in this field his life work. He completed his doctorate in 1911, after only two years of study, with a thesis on the permeability of cells. That spring, on invitation of the chairman of Princeton's biology de\u00ad partment, Edwin Grant Conklin (q.v.), who had been one of his teachers at the University of Pennsylvania, Harvey gave a lecture in Guyot Hall on the sub\u00ad ject of his Ph.D. thesis. After the lec\u00ad ture, he was promptly offered and ac-UNIVERSITY HEALTH SERVICES 243 cepted an instructorship, thus begin\u00ad ning at the age of twenty-three a career as Princeton teacher-scholar that was to last forty-five years. He became a full professor in 1919 and on Conklin's re\u00ad tirement in 1933 succeeded him as Henry Fairfield Osborn Professor. His contributions to the department were many and varied. He initiated courses in general physiology and biochemistry, subjects only rarely of\u00ad fered in biology curricula of those years. A stimulating teacher, his lec\u00ad tures were noted for their clear and precise exposition, and his laboratory was always open to serious-minded students. In his research he was, in the words of an associate, Aurin M. Chase, \"an explorer and pioneer\" who \"opened up new regions for others to develop,\" and all those who came in contact with him \"absorbed some of his boundless enthusiasm and spirit.\" Harvey's greatest scientific interest \u2014bioluminescence\u2014began during an expedition to the Great Barrier Reef of Australia in 1913. In later years he traveled extensively to observe lumi\u00ad nescent organisms and to collect mate\u00ad rial for study at Princeton. He devoted four books and more than half of some 250 published papers to biolumines- cence. \"No one,\" his student and col\u00ad league Frank H. Johnson said, \"ever has, and perhaps no one ever will, equal the untiring efforts . . . that Newton Harvey brought to bear on this subject. . . . Through his efforts, aided by the students he inspired, the Guyot Hall laboratory became the world's foremost center of research on bioluminescence. ...\" He also continued to conduct re\u00ad search in other fields, such as cell per\u00ad meability and the biological effects of supersonic waves, and, during the Sec\u00ad ond World War, decompression sick\u00adness and wound ballistics. He collabo\u00ad rated with Alfred L. Loomis in devising the centrifuge microscope and in pioneer studies in electroencephalog\u00ad raphy. Harvey was a member of a score of learned societies, including the Ameri\u00ad can Philosophical Society and the Na\u00ad tional Academy of Sciences. He served as president of the American Society of Zoologists, the American Society of Naturalists, and the International Soci\u00ad ety for Cell Biology, and was a founder and first editor of the Journal of Cel\u00ad lular and Comparative Physiology. Among the many honors accorded him were the Wetherill Medal of the Franklin Institute, the Rumford Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the grade of Officer of the Ordem Nacional do Cruziero do SuI of Brazil. In 1916, Harvey had married Ethel Nicholson Browne, also a Columbia Ph.D., noted for her research on the sea urchin. Throughout their careers they shared laboratories at Princeton and, in the summer, at Woods Hole. When they retired in 1956, his de\u00ad partmental colleagues gave him and his wife gold keys (hers engraved with a sea urchin, his with figures of luminous or\u00ad ganisms), making them, in his words, \"members of an exclusive scientific fraternity of two.\" They had two sons, Edmund Newton Harvey, Jr. '38, and Richard Bennett Harvey '43, who earned doctorates in physical chemistry and medicine, respectively. Harvey was understandably proud that every member of his family had earned a doc\u00ad tor's degree. Health Services, University. From the earliest days, health has been one of the essential concerns of the institution that began as the College of New Jersey. 244 UNIVERSITY HEALTH SERVICES When the College was relocated in 1756, among the advantages of the move from Newark cited by the trus\u00ad tees was their belief that \"the little vil\u00ad lage of Princeton\" was \"not inferior in the salubrity of the air to any village on the continent.\" Notwithstanding the benign atmos\u00ad phere, the health records of the first five presidents were grievously poor; none of them reached the ripe age at\u00ad tained by most of their successors. Stu\u00ad dents, on the other hand, in spite of the poor fare in the refectory, the damp\u00ad ness and chill of some of Nassau Hall's chambers, and the backwardness of medical practice, managed to keep well. An epidemic of dysentery swept through the college in 1813, but there were no fatalities and President Green informed the trustees that a \"chemical fumigation,\" prepared by Professor Elijah Slack from a formula in a foreign scientific magazine, had had \"a most wonderful, speedy, and happy effect in purifying the atmosphere.\" For the better part of the nineteenth century, health care was in the hands of two well-known Samaritans. John Mac\u00ad lean, Jr., whose father and both grand\u00ad fathers were physicians, ministered to ill students during the forty years that he served as vice-president or presi\u00ad dent. Isabella McCosh, daughter of an eminent Scottish physician, nursed many students to health while her hus\u00ad band was president. Effective as they were, their individual ministrations did not obviate the growing need for a more substantial health service. A search for better health facilities was intensified after the tragic typhoid epidemic of 1880, which resulted in ten deaths in a student body of 473. The epidemic brought about a thorough overhaul of the College's drainage sys\u00ad tem and the subsequent appointment of a standing faculty sanitary committee whose efforts led eventually to the con\u00ad struction in 1892 of the Isabella McCosh Infirmary (q.v.). The next major developments in health service at Princeton came in 1910 and 1911 with the beginning of a mental health program and the found\u00ad ing of the Department of Health and Physical Education. Princeton was the first American col\u00ad lege or university to provide mental health care for its students\u2014a distinc\u00ad tion it owed to a graduate of the Class of 1886, Stewart Paton (M.D. Columbia). A man of independent means who had pioneered in the teaching of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins, Paton settled in Princeton in 1910, and for sixteen years gave the University his services as lec\u00ad turer on neurobiology and as consultant on mental health for students. His counsel and treatment provided relief for disturbed and sometimes seriously maladjusted students who came to him for help, a service Princeton has carried on with continued effectiveness ever since. Later he assisted Yale, Dart\u00ad mouth, Columbia, and other universi\u00ad ties in setting up similar programs in\u00ad tended to give students some idea, as he put it, \"of what Nature\u2014and not the Faculty\u2014intended them to do emo\u00ad tionally and mentally.\" In 1911, Joseph E. Raycroft (M.D. Rush Medical College), who had been medical director at the University of Chicago for twelve years, was called to Princeton as founding chairman of the Department of Health and Physical Education. He held this position for twenty-five years, gaining wide recog\u00ad nition for the development of a com\u00ad prehensive student health program and for broadening the base of athletics through intramural competition to in\u00ad clude some ninety percent of the un-BAYARD HENRY 245 dergraduate body. He is remembered by the Raycroft Library in Dillon Gym\u00ad nasium, which contains some 1,500 volumes on medicine and sport, brought together when he was eighty with the help of colleagues, alumni, and other friends, to replace his earlier collection, which had been lost when the old gymnasium was destroyed by fire in 1944. The Raycroft administration saw the beginning in 1928 of a strong program in athletic medicine, ably directed for thirty-six years by Harry R. McPhee (M. D. Western Reserve University), a pioneer in the treatment and preven\u00ad tion of athletic injuries who also served as Head Team Physician for American athletes at four Olympic and two Pan- American Games. Under the second chairman, Wilbur H. York (M. D. Johns Hopkins), who came from Cornell in 1936, the de\u00ad partment's development was facilitated by the transfer of responsibility for physical education and intramural sport to the Department of Athletics in 1946, Under York's leadership the depart\u00ad ment utilized the many advances that were taking place in medical practice, instituting such measures as a tuber\u00ad culosis case-finding program and an al\u00ad lergy clinic, and continuing to em\u00ad phasize the use of preventive measures and the development of constructive health habits. At Cornell, Dr. York's close association with students and their problems had led to his founding of one of the early programs in mental health, and at Princeton he gave strong backing to the field pioneered by Dr. Paton and carried on by a full-time psy\u00ad chiatrist. As the trustees committee on health and athletics noted in 1962 at the time of his retirement, in the twenty- sixth year of his service, Dr. York is remembered by students and faculty for the kindliness and skill with which he treated \"their varied discomforts of body and mind.\" Under Willard Dalrymple (M. D. Harvard), who served as director for fif\u00ad teen years from 1962 to 1977, the de\u00ad partment's name was changed to Uni\u00ad versity Health Services to emphasize the wider role it was called on to play. New responsibilities included an occu\u00ad pational health and safety unit, a pro\u00ad gram in sexual education, and a Uni\u00ad versity Counseling Center, which brought together a number of previ\u00ad ously scattered counseling activities. The staff of McCosh Infirmary had grown to include five full-time physi\u00ad cians, a physician's associate, and eleven nurses. Louis A. PyIe, Jr. (M.D. Columbia), took office as the University's fourth medical director on July 1, 1977. A Princeton graduate of the Class of 1941, he had been a University physician since 1971, and associate director of the Health Services since 1972. The University has been affected by three outbreaks of contagious diseases in this century: the 1916 infantile paral\u00ad ysis epidemic which led the University to postpone its opening for two weeks; the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic which taxed McCosh Infirmary to the limit just as the University was opening for the new year; and the 1957 Asian influenza epidemic which over\u00ad whelmed the campus, requiring the conversion of the Student Center into an influenza ward with 100 beds. No student lives were lost in any of these outbreaks. Henry, Bayard, 1876(1857-1926), a life trustee for thirty years, represented the fifth generation of his family to serve in that office. Descended also from Nathaniel Fitz-246 JOSEPH HENRY Randolph, donor of the land on which Nassau Hall was built in 1756, Henry was one of a small group of alumni of the McCosh era who helped secure al\u00ad most a square mile of land for the Uni\u00ad versity early in this century. Henry himself procured the plot on Nassau Street where Holder Hall now stands and the tract on University Place oc\u00ad cupied by the dormitories south of Blair Hall, one of which was named for his son Howard Henry 04, who died in service in France in World War I. He was also responsible for the Univer\u00ad sity's acquisition of the land extending from Lake Carnegie to U.S. Route 1 between Washington Road and the Pennsylvania Railroad. . Henry practiced law in Philadelphia, served in the select council of that city and in the state senate of Pennsylvania, was a leader in the Presbyterian Church and a director of many corpora\u00ad tions. \"His sense of responsibility was steady as a rock,\" Dean West said, \"but his supreme trait was an utter un\u00ad selfishness.\" These qualities were shown in 1906 when a trust company, in which Henry was a director, was threatened with ruin by the frauds of its president. On Henry's initiative the directors voluntarily contributed $2,500,000; every depositor was paid in full, and the bank's doors were re\u00ad opened within sixty days of its failure. \"A splendid comment,\" Dean West ob\u00ad served, \"on Cicero's words: 'How much broader is the rule of duty than the rule of law!' \" Henry collaborated with M. Taylor Pyne 1877 in collecting thousands of manuscripts relating to Princeton's his\u00ad tory. The fruits of their labors are found in the Pyne-Henry Collection, which has long been one of the University Li\u00ad brary's treasures. His concern for Princeton continued to the end of his life. In their memorial minute the Trustees made special men\u00ad tion of his loyalty and devotion and de\u00ad clared that the University \"owes much to his great foresight in securing lands adequate for our future needs.\" Henry, Joseph (1797-1878), the leading American scientist after Benjamin Franklin until Willard Gibbs, was a professor at Princeton from 1832 to 1846. His chief scientific contributions were in the field of electromagnetism, where he discovered the phenomenon of self-inductance. The unit of induct\u00ad ance, called \"the henry,\" immortalizes his name. Henry is also remembered as the first Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, where he made extraordi\u00ad nary contributions to the organization and development of American science. Of Scottish descent, Henry was the son of a day-laborer in Albany, N. Y. As a small boy he was sent to live with his grandmother in a village about 40 miles from Albany. There he worked in a general store after school hours and at the age of thirteen was apprenticed to a watchmaker. As a young man he be\u00ad came interested in the theater and was offered employment as a professional actor, but in 1819 several well- positioned Albany friends persuaded him instead to attend the Albany Academy, where free tuition was pro\u00ad vided. His interest in science had al\u00ad ready been aroused by a chance en\u00ad counter with a popular scientific book, and by 1823 his education was so far advanced that he was assisting in the teaching of science courses. By 1826, after a stint as a district schoolteacher and as a private tutor, he was appointed Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at the Academy. Here, in spite of a teaching schedule that oc\u00ad cupied him seven hours a day, he did JOSEPH HENRY 247 his most important scientific experi\u00ad ments. Henry had become interested in ter\u00ad restrial magnetism, which was then, as today, an important scientific topic. This led him to experiment with elec- tromagnetism. His apprenticeship as a watchmaker stood him in good stead in the construction of batteries and other apparatus. Oersted and others had ob\u00ad served magnetic effects from electric currents, but Henry was the first to wind insulated wires around an iron core to obtain powerful electromag\u00ad nets. Before he left Albany, he built one for Yale that would lift 2,300 pounds, the largest in the world at that time. In experimenting with such mag\u00ad nets, Henry observed the large spark that was generated when the circuit was broken, and he deduced the prop\u00ad erty known as self-inductance, the iner- tial characteristic of an electric circuit. The self-inductance of a circuit tends to prevent the current from changing; if a current is flowing, self-inductance tends to keep it flowing, or if an elec\u00ad tromotive force is applied self-induct\u00ad ance tends to keep it from building up. Henry found that the self-inductance is greatly affected by the configuration of the circuit, especially the coiling of the wire. He also discovered how to make non-inductive windings by folding the wire back on itself. While Henry was doing these exper\u00ad iments, Michael Faraday did similar work in England. Henry was always slow in publishing his results, and he was unaware of Faraday's work. Today Faraday is recognized as the discoverer of mutual inductance (the basis of trans\u00ad formers), while Henry is credited with the discovery of self-inductance. In 1832, when Henry was 35, Yale's distinguished geologist Benjamin Silli- man was consulted regarding the possi\u00adble appointment of Henry to Princeton. Silliman replied, \"As a physical philos\u00ad opher he has no superior in our coun\u00ad try; certainly not among the young men.\" Henry, always modest, had re\u00ad sponded to tentative inquiries, \"Are you aware of the fact that I am not a graduate of any college and that I am principally self-educated?\" Henry's initial salary at Princeton was $1,000 per annum plus a house. The Trustees also provided $100 \"for the purchase of a new electrical ma\u00ad chine &c.\" At that point the College was near bankruptcy and Maclean was trying to institute reforms and build up the faculty. Henry was a notable acqui\u00ad sition, and he found the lighter teach\u00ad ing schedule and the intellectual com\u00ad panionship at Princeton congenial, especially when his brother-in-law Stephen Alexander (q.v.) joined the faculty to teach astronomy. Henry worked with Alexander in the observa\u00ad tion of sunspots and continued his own work on magnets, building for Princeton an even larger magnet than he had built for Yale, one that would lift 3,500 pounds. He also rigged two long wires, one in front of Nassau Hall and one behind, so that he was able to send a signal by induction through the build\u00ad ing. Another wire from his laboratory in Philosophical Hall to his home on the campus (see Joseph Henry House) was used to send signals to his wife; this signal system used a remote electro\u00ad magnet to close a switch for a stronger local circuit, and constituted in effect the invention of the magnetic relay. A similar arrangement was used by S.F.B. Morse in the invention of the telegraph; Morse had consulted Henry and had used one of his scientific pa\u00ad pers. Later, Henry was called to testify in a patent suit involving the telegraph, Morse vs. O'Reilly. Although Henry 248 JOSEPH HENRY had encouraged and helped Morse in his project, his testimony that the prin\u00ad ciple of the telegraph had been known to himself and to Professor Wheatstone in England undermined Morse's claim to originality. This led to much un\u00ad pleasantness and controversy, but Henry's reputation emerged un\u00ad scathed. In addition to natural philosophy (physics), Henry taught chemistry, ge\u00ad ology, mineralogy, astronomy, and architecture\u2014in the words of Freder\u00ad ick Seitz, Ph.D. '34, former president of the National Academy of Sciences, he was \"a very large economy pack\u00ad age. \" A rather reserved and quiet man, he was nevertheless a popular teacher. The College gave Henry an opportu\u00ad nity, then unusual, to travel abroad on leave at full salary. In 1837 he met Faraday, Wheatstone, and other Brit\u00ad ish scientists, to whom he explained his idea of \"quantity\" and \"intensity\" cir\u00ad cuits (low and high impedance, in mod\u00ad ern terms). He returned to Princeton with a variety of scientific equipment purchased abroad. During his remaining years in Princeton Henry continued his electri\u00ad cal investigations, but also branched out into the study of phosphorescence, sound, capillary action, and ballistics. In 1844 he was a member of a commit\u00ad tee to investigate the explosion of a gun during a demonstration on the new U.S.S. Princeton; the Secretaries of State and Navy and several con\u00ad gressmen were among the spectators killed. His experiments on gun castings on this committee led him into the sub\u00ad ject of the molecular cohesion of mat\u00ad ter. In 1846, having received from an Englishman, James Smithson, a large bequest for the founding of an institu\u00ad tion \"for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men,\" the U.S. Congress established the Smithsonian Institution. A distinguished board was appointed, with instructions to find the best possible man to head the new In\u00ad stitution as secretary, and the invitation was soon extended to Henry. He was reluctant to leave Princeton and the opportunity to do his own scientific in\u00ad vestigations. \"If I go,\" he said to a friend, \"I shall probably exchange per\u00ad manent fame for transient reputation.\" But he finally accepted and threw his enormous energy and knowledge and experience into the development of the Smithsonian, which became the first great driving force in the organization and direction of American science. Henry was one of the original mem\u00ad bers of the National Academy of Sci\u00ad ences and served as its second presi\u00ad dent. He was also a trustee of Princeton and president of the American Associa\u00ad tion for the Advancement of Science. When he died in 1878 his funeral was attended by the president of the United States with his cabinet, the chief justice and associate justices of the Supreme Court, by many members of both houses of Congress, and by many scien\u00ad tists and other illustrious personages. In 1872, John C. Green, founder of the School of Science at Princeton, en\u00ad dowed a chair of physics in Henry's honor (held since then by C. F. Brack\u00ad ed, W. F. Magie, E. P. Adams, H. D. Smyth, and J. A. Wheeler). Almost a century later, when the main physics building, Jadwin Hall, was dedicated in 1970, the Physics Department man\u00ad ifested its continuing esteem for Henry by declaring that all of the laboratory facilities housed in Jadwin and Palmer Halls and the Elementary Particles Laboratory should be collectively known as the Joseph Henry Labora\u00ad tories. Some of Henry's laboratory equipment is on display in the lobby of Jadwin Hall. His campus home, built to HARRY HAMMOND HESS 249 his design, is called the Joseph Henry House (q.v.). In Washington his statue stands before the old Smithsonian Building. Herbert S. Bailey, Jr. Henry, Joseph, House, The, was built in 1837 to the design of the eminent physicist of that name, and occupied by him until he left in 1848 to become the first secretary of the Smithsonian In\u00ad stitution in Washington. It was to this house that Professor Henry sent tele\u00ad graphic messages (sometimes to order lunch) from his laboratory in Philo\u00ad sophical Hall, which stood where Chancellor Green Student Center now stands. The Joseph Henry House was made the official residence of the dean of the College soon after that office was created in 1909 and was so used through the incumbencies of Deans El\u00ad liott, McClenahan, Gauss, Godolphin, and Finch. 1961 it became the home of William D'O. Lippincott, dean of students from 1954 to 1968, and execu\u00ad tive director of the Alumni Council from 1968 to 1972. In 1973 it became the home of Aaron Lemonick, dean of the faculty and professor of physics. In a community where well-traveled buildings are no rarity, the Joseph Henry House has made more journeys than any other. Three times since it came into being on the south side of Stanhope Hall it has had to move to make way for other buildings: in 1879 for Reunion Hall (which was razed in 1966), in 1925 for the University Chapel, in 1946 for Firestone Library. It now stands just north of Chancellor Green, across the Front Campus from the John Maclean House. Hess, Harry Hammond (1906-1969), sixth Blair Professor of Geology, did his undergraduate work at Yale (B. S. 1931), where according to his own\u2014 possibly apocryphal\u2014account, he failed his first course in mineralogy and was told there was no future for him in that field. Following two years as a mineral prospector in the bush country of Northern Rhodesia and three years of graduate study at Princeton under Arthur F. Buddington in petrology, Alexander H. Phillips in mineralogy, Richard M. Field in oceanic structure, and Edward Sampson in mineral de\u00ad posits, he went on to become a min\u00ad eralogist of world repute whose far- reaching contributions made him, in the words of a National Academy of Sciences memoir, \"one of the truly re\u00ad markable earth scientists of this cen\u00ad tury. \" Hess brought to his research a rare talent for precision work combined with a boldness in the formulation of sweeping hypotheses in which, as one colleague put it, \"he took the whole globe as his province.\" His careful at\u00ad tention to detail was evident in his work on peridotite, the subject of his doc\u00ad toral dissertation, and on other multra- mafic rocks\u2014believed to be the princi\u00ad pal components of the earth's mantle. The boldness and brilliant intuition for which he became even better known were manifested in his introduction of new concepts on the origin of ocean ba\u00ad sins and island arcs (long, curved chains of islands), on mountain building, and on the cause of continental drift. De\u00ad scribed by one of his scientific col\u00ad leagues as \"a fierce fighter for science,\" he was also known for his relaxed and quietly humorous guidance in commit\u00ad tee work which, along with his good judgment in public affairs, made him a leader among the scientists who helped guide the development of the national space program. After taking his Ph.D. degree at Princeton in 1932, Hess spent a year as 250 HARRY HAMMOND HESS an instructor at Rutgers and another as a research associate in the Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington before joining the Princeton faculty as instructor in 1934. In 1950 he followed his principal teacher and close friend, Arthur Budd- ington, as chairman of the department and in 1964 succeeded him as Blair Pro\u00ad fessor. During the thirties Hess participated in submarine gravity studies of the West Indies island arc, and, in order to facilitate operations on Navy sub\u00ad marines, he acquired a commission as lieutenant, junior grade, thus initiating a long association with the United States Naval Reserve, where he ulti\u00ad mately rose to the rank of rear admiral. Called to active duty in 1941, he dis\u00ad charged important wartime duties and, at the same time, kept alive his scien\u00ad tific curiosity. Early in the war, he de\u00ad veloped a successful system for estimat\u00ad ing the daily positions of German sub\u00ad marines in the North Atlantic, and in order to obtain a first-hand test of the effectiveness of his detection program, he served, at his own request, on a hazardous mission aboard the sub\u00ad marine decoy vessel U.S.S. Big Horn. Later he took part in four major land\u00ad ings in the Pacific as commander of the attack transport U.S.S. Cape Johnson. Utilizing the transport's sounding gear, he was able to take thousands of miles of depth soundings that led to his dis\u00ad covery of the flat-topped sea mounts\u2014 submerged ancient islands\u2014that he later named \"guyots\" in honor of the Swiss geographer Arnold Guyot, found\u00ad er of the Princeton geology depart\u00ad ment and first Blair Professor. One of the guyots found by others after Hess's initial discoveries was named \"Hess Guyot\" in his honor. On his return to Princeton from war service, Hess organized, secured fund\u00ad ing for, and directed the Princeton Caribbean Research Project. Sup\u00ad ported by the University, the National Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, several oil companies, and the governments of Puerto Rico, Vene\u00ad zuela, and Colombia, this continuing program explored every aspect of Caribbean geology and provided a val\u00ad uable training ground for graduate stu\u00ad dents from many parts of the world, producing thirty-four Ph.D. disserta\u00ad tions. In 1960 Hess made his single most important contribution, which is re\u00ad garded as \"part of the major advance in geologic science of this century.\" In a widely circulated report to the Office of Naval Research, he advanced the theory, now generally accepted, that the earth's crust moved laterally from long, volcanically active oceanic ridges. \"Sea-floor spreading,\" as the proc\u00ad ess was later named, helped estab\u00ad lish the concept of continental drift as scientifically respectable and triggered a \"revolution in the earth sciences.\" This report was formally published in his History of Ocean Basins (1962), which for a time was the single most referenced work in solid-earth geo\u00ad physics. Hess also made significant contribu\u00ad tions to the affairs of his department, the University, and the national scien\u00ad tific community. During his sixteen years as chairman, the Department of Geology enjoyed substantial growth, later recognized by the change of its name to Department of Geological and Geophysical Sciences. During this same period Hess's faculty colleagues elected him to the Advisory Committee on Appointments and Advancements in eleven successive years and also the faculty advisory committee on the elec-JOHN GRIER HIBBEN 251 tion of a new president in 1957, when Robert F. Goheen was chosen to suc\u00ad ceed Harold W. Dodds. Following his election to the National Academy of Sciences in 1952, Hess was called on frequently to head national scientific committees, serving as chairman of the Academy's Committee for Disposal of Radioactive Wastes, the National Re\u00ad search Council's Earth Sciences Divi\u00ad sion, and the Academy's Space Science Board, which was established to advise the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on scientific aspects of the development of the national space program. At the time of his death, he was one of ten members of a scientific panel appointed to analyze rock sam\u00ad ples brought back from the moon by the Apollo 11 crew. Hess's achievements were widely recognized by fellow scientists. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, in addition to the National Academy of Sciences, and to foreign membership in the geological societies of London, South Africa, and Venezuela. He also served as president of the Mineralogical Society of America, as well as of the Geological Society of America, which gave him its highest award, the Penrose Medal, in 1966. That same year he was elected to foreign membership in the Academia Nazionale dei Lincei of Rome, the world's oldest academy of science, and became the first earth scientist from the Western hemisphere to receive its $32,000 Feltrinelli Prize. Three years later, just a few months before his death, Yale conferred on him an honor\u00ad ary degree of Doctor of Science. His death, of a heart attack, occurred on August 25, 1969, in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, while he was presiding at a Space Science Board conference he had organized to reformulate the scien\u00ad tific objectives of lunar exploration. He was buried in the Arlington National Cemetery and was posthumously awarded the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Distinguished Public Service Award. In a Faculty memorial minute, his Princeton colleagues observed: \"Harry Hess had a deep, almost a religious, reverence for the awesome order of the universe. He possessed that combina\u00ad tion of a driving urge to discover truth and a profound humility before the vast truths yet unknown which is the mark of the truly creative scholar.\" Hibben, John Grier (1861-1933), four\u00ad teenth president of Princeton, was born on April 19, 1861, in Peoria, Illinois. He entered Princeton with the Class of 1882 and at graduation was both class president and valedictorian. Following a year of study in Berlin, he attended Princeton Theological Seminary. On November 8, 1887, he married Jenny Davidson of Elizabeth, New Jersey. Ordained in the same year, he served Presbyterian churches in St. Louis and Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, until a throat ailment cut short his career in the church and turned him toward graduate studies in philosophy at Princeton where he became an instruc\u00ad tor in logic in 1891 and received his Ph.D. in 1893. Four years later, he was named Stuart Professor of Logic, a sub\u00ad ject he continued to teach, along with psychology and the Bible, until his election to the presidency on January 11, 1912. The search for a successor to Wood- row Wilson had lasted for fifteen months. Hibben's nomination and elec\u00ad tion came at the hands of those trustees who had most resisted Wilson's re\u00ad forms, and this posed a special problem 252 JOHN GRIER HIBBEN for the new president, whose warm friendship with Wilson had rapidly cooled after Hibben had joined forces with Wilson's principal opponents in the Graduate School controversy, Moses Taylor Pyne and Dean Andrew F. West. The University had become sharply divided during the controversy, and Hibben felt that his most urgent task was to bring the factions together. At his first public appearance after the election, he set the tone for his entire administration. \"IfI am to prove myself worthy in some small way of the con\u00ad fidence reposed in me,\" he told the alumni of Orange, New Jersey, \"my administration must make for peace. I wish to say to the alumni that which I said to the board of trustees on the day of election to this high office, and later to the faculty, that I represent no group or set of men, no party, no faction, no past allegiance or affiliation\u2014but one united Princeton!\" Hibben's actions proved his words. One of his first acts as president was to seek out several faculty members of the Wilson faction and urge them to coop\u00ad erate with him in continuing the work begun by Wilson. Many had feared, ac\u00ad cording to Professor William Berryman Scott, that the election of Hibben \"sig\u00ad nified the triumph of Wilson's enemies on the board as well as in the faculty.\" But, Scott acknowledged, \"I was en\u00ad tirely mistaken,\" for Hibben's \"genial and kindly nature\" soon healed the breach, and even Wilson's strongest supporter, Professor Henry B. Fine, came in time to feel that Hibben was a \"singularly happy choice.\" Hibben's style in office was more that of the coordinator and mediator than of the dynamic, innovative leader. \"Tem\u00ad perate yet effective,\" \"tolerant, candid and fair,\" are the kind of comments that recur in the observations of col\u00adleagues, alumni and trustees. His popu\u00ad larity as a teacher and his reputation for fair-mindedness\u2014celebrated by more than twenty-five successive classes in the faculty song: \"Here's to Hibben, we call him Jack I The whitest man in all the Fac\"\u2014followed him into Prospect. In the fall of 1913, Hibben presided over elaborate ceremonies attending the formal opening of the impressive new Graduate College. Former Presi\u00ad dent Taft and Dean West gave the prin\u00ad cipal addresses. Set apart on a hill about a half mile from the heart of the campus, the College represented the triumph of the work and ideas of Dean West and trustee Pyne. As dean of the Graduate School under Presidents Pat- ton and Wilson, West had exercised nearly autonomous powers. However, within a year, those powers were to be severely reduced by the trustees when they wrote new by-laws making the Graduate School in every aspect of its administration subject to President Hibben and the standing committees of the trustees and faculty. A possible fu\u00ad ture source of difficulty for Hibben's leadership was thus removed at the outset. The outbreak of the European War in 1914 brought new problems for the University as for the nation. President Hibben was a strong advocate of pre\u00ad paredness and of intervention on the side of the Allies. When America en\u00ad tered in 1917, he lost no time in placing the University's resources at the dis\u00ad posal of the government. Army, navy and aviation training schools were soon busily functioning on campus, and many buildings, laboratories, and other facilities were made available to various research and operational programs. As the University donned khaki, Princeton men, too, flocked to the colors. By Sep\u00ad tember 1918, there were only sixty un-JOHN GRIER HIBBEN 253 dergraduates not in service. In all, more than six thousand Princetonians \u2014faculty, alumni, graduate and under\u00ad graduate students\u2014served in some branch of the armed forces. Of these, 151 made the supreme sacrifice. Hib- ben spoke out frequently in support of the war effort and was honored by Pres\u00ad ident Lowell as a \"leader in patriotic thought\" upon the presentation of a Harvard LL. D. As a cleric as well as an educator, Hibben was distressed by the extent to which secular forces seemed to hold sway over undergraduate minds and habits during the postwar period. These tendencies had been, he thought, \"largely affected by the hypocrisy attending the Eighteenth Amendment, by false standards of liv\u00ad ing growing out of our period of ficti\u00ad tious prosperity and by a skepticism to\u00ad ward old concepts of morals and reli\u00ad gion following the World War.\" All this had resulted in a greater emphasis on social activities, he reported, a more luxurious style of living, particularly in the eating clubs, and the development of \"week-ending\" as more undergradu\u00ad ates sought diversion away from Prince\u00ad ton\u2014usually in the city. Among Hib- ben's remedies for these unhappy influ\u00ad ences was the building of eight new dormitories\u2014Pyne, Henry, Foulke, Laughlin, 1901, Lockhart, 1903, and Walker Halls\u2014which permitted the housing of some 82 percent of the 2,200 undergraduates, a 28 percent increase over the situation immediately follow\u00ad ing the war. Also, the eating clubs, viewed as a \"vexing problem\" by Hib\u00ad ben no less than by his predecessor, were brought under new regulations regarding membership eligibility and self-government. Another restriction, which involved what Hibben consid\u00ad ered one of the \"most serious enemies\" of the residential life of Princeton, came in 1927 when, with the Presi\u00ad dent's concerned approval, the trustees prohibited the operation of cars by un\u00ad dergraduates except in special cases. Hibben's plans for countering these centrifugal impulses of social life also included the establishment of a student center as a focal point for the meeting and interaction of all members of the community. These plans were well- advanced when the onset of the great depression forced their postponement. But, over the years, perhaps none of these physical structures has had as much effect in drawing together the various elements of student life as Hib\u00ad ben's appointment, in 1930, of the Council on Undergraduate Life, which has served to the present day as a most helpful sounding board and clearing\u00ad house for undergraduate problems and concerns. The special quality of Hibben's lead\u00ad ership emerged slowly over the years. It was his practice to look to the faculty for initiative in new programs, and he was invariably rewarded with the coop\u00ad eration of leading members, many of whom had been recruited during the Wilson years. The preceptorial system was further developed and extended to sophomore courses, but the most sig\u00ad nificant curriculum reform under Hib\u00ad ben's stewardship came in 1923 with the inauguration of the \"four course plan,\" or more formally, the \"Upper- class Plan of Study.\" As Hibben re\u00ad ported to the trustees, this plan sought \"to elevate the plane of endeavor and attainment of the whole undergraduate body\" rather than that of a few students as provided by the old Honors Course program. The idea was to give the stu\u00ad dent more freedom during the upper- class years for independent reading in a particular subject in lieu of taking a 254 JOHN GRIER HIBBEN fifth course. It all culminated in a senior thesis and a comprehensive examina\u00ad tion period. Despite some initial doubts, the program quickly proved successful and was much emulated elsewhere. Professor Eisenhart as chairman of the Committee on the Course of Study had responsibility for organizing the new program and his ef\u00ad forts were the major ingredient in its continuing success. The plan endures in substance to this day in the Princeton program. Hibben sought persistently to draw the faculty into closer relation with the president and trustees in the conduct of University affairs. His greatest success in this regard was the creation of a Committee on Appointments and Ad\u00ad vancements consisting of three mem\u00ad bers of the faculty chosen by that body and charged with conferring with the president regarding his recommenda\u00ad tions to the trustees. The \"Committee of Three,\" later enlarged, became one of the most important liaison groups on campus. In the same direction, more members of the faculty were named to trustee committees to establish a better working relationship on university mat\u00ad ters of joint interest. The faculty also benefited from the successful fund drive by the Graduate Council to raise salaries, and with an improved salary scale came a new system of retirement, pensions, and insurance. The years after the war also brought a vast increase in the University's facili\u00ad ties for instruction and research. \"Never in all her history,\" recalled one member of the faculty, \"was Princeton the scene of such Aladdin magic as un\u00ad folded itself during the last twelve years of the Hibben administration.\" A De\u00ad partment of Oriental Languages and Literatures was established in 1922, and three new schools were created: in 1919, the School of Architecture; in 1921, the School of Engineering; and in 1930, the School of Public and Interna\u00ad tional Affairs founded to carry forward the Princeton tradition for public serv\u00ad ice and later appropriately named for Woodrow Wilson. Significant support for faculty research also came with the establishment in 1922 of the Industrial Relations Section; in 1928, of the Inter\u00ad national Finance Section; and in 1929, of a three-million-dollar Foundation for Scientific Research made possible by a General Education Board grant, sup\u00ad plemented by gifts of alumni and other friends. The endowment fund rose dra\u00ad matically under Hibben and by the end of his administration topped more than $24 million, a 374 percent increase. The University benefited from the bur\u00ad geoning national economy and grew in step through the loyal support of the alumni. The remarkable increase in the general endowment was paralleled by numerous generous gifts in the form of new buildings. Besides the eight dor\u00ad mitories already mentioned, the list in\u00ad cluded two other dormitories, Cuyler and Joline Halls; the North Court quadrangle at the Graduate College and five new undergraduate dining halls; six new buildings for instruction and research\u2014McCormick, Eno, Green, Frick, Dickinson, and Fine Halls\u2014Palmer Stadium, Baker Rink, McCosh Infirmary, McCarter Theater, faculty apartments on Prospect Avenue and College Road, and the magnificent new University Chapel, whose nave was named for Hibben by the trustees in recognition of his personal efforts to make the chapel a reality. In all, some thirty buildings were constructed dur\u00ad ing Hibben's administration while the total area of the campus doubled in size. DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY 255 Growth of the faculty was also impres\u00ad sive\u2014in quality as well as quantity\u2014as the teaching force expanded some 73 percent under Hibben, who managed to retain most of the luminaries of the Wilson era and to add other accom\u00ad plished or promising scholars. At the same time, the student body increased by nearly a thousand, even though a policy of limited enrollment and selec\u00ad tive admission had been adopted in 1922. In 1932, when Hibben retired, the University was by more than a full turn larger and, on every level, more ad\u00ad vanced than it had been in 1912. Perhaps Professor Charles G. Osgood, a Wilson appointee, who went the dis\u00ad tance under Hibben's temperate, wise, and corporate leadership, said it best when he characterized Hibben's ad\u00ad ministration as the \"flowering and har\u00ad vest of Wilson's plantings.\" Certainly few could match the service and devo\u00ad tion Hibben gave to the University and its constituents for more than forty years. \"Princeton was Dr. Hibben's en\u00ad tire life,\" said one of his colleagues. \"He was a man of warm and generous instincts,\" added Professor Osgood, \"concerned with the individual case of every member of the Princeton house\u00ad hold.\" The University was his \"parish.\" Hibben retired at the end of the school year in 1932, and a year later died in a tragic automobile accident that also fatally injured Mrs. Hibben. \"He had a profound sense of fairness and justice,\" observed the trustees in their memorial minute, \"and the wounds of time were healed by it.\" David W. Hirst History, The Department of. For a de\u00ad partment that has been a favorite with undergraduates since the 1920s, His\u00adtory was a long time a-borning. With- erspoon lectured on history, and al\u00ad though he felt that it was \"subservient to the interests of religion,\" he was also concerned with what would now be called social and intellectual history. History was used to fill a few small cracks in the curriculum in the nineteenth century, but it seems to have been largely chronology and made little impression on undergraduates. The first faculty member to have the title of Professor of History\u2014Charles Woodruff Shields (1869-1882)\u2014was also Professor of the Harmony of Sci\u00ad ence and Revealed Religion. He wrote a long (18 pages) and anguished letter to the trustees in 1872 begging to be re\u00ad lieved of his elective courses in history. His petition was refused, but finally, in 1883, William Milligan Sloane was made Professor of History and Political Science. He was a professional histo\u00ad rian, author of a number of useful books, but he departed for Columbia in 1896. Meanwhile, the two most famous writers of history at Princeton were not considered historians. John Rach Mc- Master (q.v.), whose History of the American People revolutionized the writing of American history was a teacher of engineering. A proposal that he be made a professor of history was turned down by scandalized trustees who thought that he should stick to his trade, and he took a chair at Pennsylva\u00ad nia in 1883. (Princeton made amends by giving him an honorary degree in 1925.) The other widely read Princeton historian was Woodrow Wilson (q.v.), who was actually a political scientist. When Wilson set up the departmen\u00ad tal system in 1904, history, politics and economics were lumped together. A young preceptor had to be a versatile man to jump from medieval history to 256 DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY international law to money and bank\u00ad ing. A few survived these hardships and became distinguished scholars\u2014nota\u00ad bly Edward S. Corwin (q.v.) and Charles H. Mcllwain (the latter, alas, lost to Harvard). Some relief came when economics split off in 1913, but it was only in 1924, under the pressure of the Four-Course Plan, that history was separated from politics. Three key appointments determined the future of the history department. One of Wilson's last acts was to name Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker (q.v.) to the faculty. Wertenbaker became an eminent writer on early American his\u00ad tory, and a revered teacher of many graduate students. In 1912 the two Halls, \"Beppo\" and \"Buzzer,\" joined the Department. They were entirely different in temperament and interest; one student wrote of the \"aristocratic Mr. Hall who believes in democracy\" [Beppo] and the \"democratic Mr. Hall who believes in aristocracy\" [Buzzer]. But they were both great under\u00ad graduate teachers, and they set such a high standard that no young instructor coming to Princeton could feel com\u00ad fortable if he were a poor teacher. This combination of solid scholarship and excellent teaching was reinforced when Dana Carleton Munro (q.v.) joined the department in 1916. For 20 years (1916-1936) first \"old Dana\" Munro (his son, Dana Gardner Munro, joined the Department in 1932), and then Wertenbaker held the chairman\u00ad ship of the history department. They began the work of recruiting the re\u00ad markable group of young men who were to carry the department to a peak of professional excellence while making it one of the best teaching units in the University. These were the years of the famous freshman course called \"Histor\u00ad ical Introduction,\" taught first by Joseph C. Green and then by John Pomfret. It was an exhausting course, both for those who took it and those who taught it. (Green took refuge in the State Department, Pomfret in the pres\u00ad idency of William and Mary, and later in the directorship of the Huntington Library.) But in spite of its rigorous na\u00ad ture the course gave students a taste for historical studies, and enrollments in the Department began to grow. These were also the years in which Raymond Sontag, Robert Albion, Elmer Beller, Joseph Strayer, E. Har\u00ad ris (\"Jinks\") Harbison (q.v.), Robert Palmer, Gordon Craig, Cyril Black, and Eric Goldman began their Prince\u00ad ton careers. Sontag had played an im\u00ad portant role in recruiting the younger members of the group, especially dur\u00ad ing his chairmanship (1939-1941), but he was lured to Berkeley in 1941. The others remained to form the nucleus of the postwar department. The Second World War put the de\u00ad partment in a difficult position. Many of the regular members left for service in the armed forces or in Washington. Meanwhile, the government flooded the campus with thousands of young soldiers, sailors, and marines, all of whom\u2014it was considered\u2014needed a course in American history to be saved. To teach these multitudes, the depart\u00ad ment recruited one of the most distin\u00ad guished\u2014if not the most professional \u2014groups it ever had on its roster. Pro\u00ad fessors of art, philosophy, political sci\u00ad ence and music, who had few students in their own fields, became instant experts on the Revolution and the Civil War. The professor of music wrote a \"Fanfare for History\" in memory of his experience; it is said to be somewhat dissonant. In 1945 the department came back to normal, as far as its personnel was con-HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE 257 cerned, but found that the new genera\u00ad tion of undergraduates had an insati\u00ad able appetite for history of all sorts. This posed three problems: to recruit new members to handle the increased enrollment, to add new fields to meet the needs of a new age, and to keep other universities from stealing its best men. The first two problems were solved more easily than the third. Jerome Blum and Charles Gillispie came immediately after the war; Frank Craven (as a replacement for Werten- baker) four years later. All three added greatly to the strength of the depart\u00ad ment. \"Young Dana\" Munro had begun teaching Latin American history before the war; his work was continued by Stanley Stein. Cyril Black built up a strong program in Russian studies. Then Charles Gillispie assembled a remarkable group of men in History of Science, while Marius Jansen started Far Eastern Studies at a high level. Joint appointments strengthened the old ties between History and Near Eastern Studies. A little later Robert Tignor began giving courses in African History. This was quite a change from the old curriculum, restricted to Euro\u00ad pean and American history and heavily political in emphasis. During the chairmanship of Joseph Strayer (1941-1961) the department reached the peak of excellence at which Munro, Wertenbaker, and Sontag had aimed. The teacher-scholar tradition was stronger than ever. Harbison was one of the best preceptors the Univer\u00ad sity ever had and was an expert on the Reformation. Craig's lectures rivaled those of \"Buzzer\" Hall in popularity, and his work on German history was praised on both sides of the Atlantic. Courses in Russian history (Black), medieval history (Strayer), and Ameri\u00ad can diplomatic history (Challener) drew surprisingly large numbers of students. Palmer's great book on the Age of the Democratic Revolution was appearing; Julian Boyd's remarkable edition of the Jefferson Papers was well under way; Arthur Link was getting out the first volumes of the Wilson Papers. It was generally recognized that Princeton had one of the three or four best history departments in the country. The generous gift of $5,000,000 to the de\u00ad partment by Shelby Cullom Davis '30 was a recognition of this eminence. The premature death of Harbison and the departure of Craig and Palmer to other universities left serious gaps in the department's program. Student demands for new types of history and more specialized courses complicated the problem. The chairmen of the 1960s and early '70s (Blum, Stone, Challener, and Gillispie) had much re\u00ad building to do. Lawrence Stone's will\u00ad ingness to come to Princeton from Ox\u00ad ford filled one of the biggest holes (six\u00ad teenth and seventeenth-century Eng\u00ad land), while Arno Mayer picked up the work in modern Europe and Robert Darnton took on eighteenth-century Europe and the French Revolution. Another group of promising young as\u00ad sistant professors (including, for the first time, two women) was recruited. As of 1976, Princeton was still consid\u00ad ered one of the best places to study his\u00ad tory, and undergraduate enrollment in history was larger than that in any other department. Five Princeton historians have served as president of the American Historical Association: the elder Munro in 1926, Wertenbaker in 1947, Boyd in 1964, Palmer in 1970, Strayer in 1971. Joseph R. Strayer History and Philosophy of Science, Program in. The two disciplines united 258 HOLDER HALL in the program are as old as learning it\u00ad self, although they have emerged as distinct enterprises only in this cen\u00ad tury. Philosophers since Aristotle have made the epistemological and meta\u00ad physical commitments of natural in\u00ad quiry a major concern of philosophy, and many, ranging from Aristotle and Bacon to Whewell and Comte, have looked to the history of scientific thought for clues about its conceptual structure. From the outset, then, readers of philosophy at Princeton have had some exposure to history and phi\u00ad losophy of science, and the latter re\u00ad mains central to the philosophy cur\u00ad riculum. Long of interest also to scientists, history of science began to form a spe\u00ad cial field of history in the 1930s and re\u00ad ceived its main impetus during the 1950s as the impact of science on mod\u00ad ern society increasingly concerned sci\u00ad entists and educators (cf. Princeton's Committee on Science in Human Af\u00ad fairs established in 1962). Taught at Princeton on occasion by scientists be\u00ad fore World War II, history of science became a regular offering in 1955-1956 with Charles C. Gillispie's survey course sponsored jointly by History and the Council of the Humanities. The growing need for historians and philosophers of science led in 1960 to a special graduate program chaired by Gillispie under the auspices of the de\u00ad partments of history and philosophy, and the Council. Expansion planned in 1963 culminated in 1970 with a full staff of five historians and five philosophers. In 1968 the program, by then largely autonomous but still working closely with history and philosophy, increased its lecture offerings and established an undergraduate major. Since its inception the program has shared the international reputation of its leading faculty. In particular, Gillis\u00ad pie, together with Charles Scribner, Jr. '43, conceived and directed the monu\u00ad mental Dictionary of Scientific Biog\u00ad raphy (14 vols., N. Y., Scribner's, 1970-76); Carl G. Hempel published fundamental studies on the nature of scientific explanation; and Thomas S. Kuhn, in pursuing and defending the thesis of his Structure of Scientific Rev\u00ad olutions (Chicago, 1962) set the tone for contemporary discussions of the scien\u00ad tific enterprise. Michael S. Mahoney Holder Hall forms the large quadrangle on Nassau Street, three sides contain\u00ad ing dormitory rooms, the fourth clois\u00ad ters, the whole dominated by Holder Tower. Noteworthy features are the heavy, slate roofs and the leaded casement windows of the dormitory, the vaulted passages of the cloisters, and the unique finials atop the pinna\u00ad cles on Holder Tower\u2014four bronze tigers-rampant\u2014which also function as weathervanes. Holder Hall was given in 1909 by Margaret Olivia Sage, widow of the fin\u00ad ancier, Russell Sage, and named at her request for her ancestor, Christopher Holder, \"a member of the Society of Friends in America in the Seventeenth Century,\" a tablet in the arch beneath the tower tells us, \"devout, loving, loyal to duty, patient in suffering.\" Holder Hall was erected on the site of the unmarked graveyard of the fam\u00ad ily of Nathanial FitzRandolph, one of the College's early benefactors who is memorialized by a tablet in the east arch and also by the FitzRandolph Gateway (q.v.). Holder and the adjoining dining halls were both designed by Day and Klauder, who, \"in this great group,\" HONORARY DEGREES 259 Ralph Adams Cram said, \"reach the highest point in their authoritative in\u00ad terpretation of Gothic as a living style.\" Honorary degrees have been awarded by Princeton since its earliest days. The degree of Master of Arts, honoris causa, was conferred on the governor of the Province of New Jersey, Jonathan Belcher, at the College's first com\u00ad mencement in 1748. For the first cen\u00ad tury and a half, however, most degrees were conferred by the trustees at their stated meetings and the recipients in\u00ad formed of the honor by letter from the clerk. In 1895 the trustees amended their by-laws to provide that thereafter no honorary degree should be conferred except upon a recipient present in per\u00ad son. The Sesquicentennial Celebration the following year was the first occasion when honorary graduands assembled for the formal conferring of their de\u00ad grees. There were fifty-six, the largest company ever honored at one time.* In 1905 Dean West (q.v.) inaugu\u00ad rated the practice of reading a formal ci\u00ad tation as he presented each graduand; he continued to do this through 1925. Others who followed him as University Orator were Deans William F. Magie, Augustus Trowbridge, Luther P. Eisenhart, and Donald B. Aldrich; and trustees Roland S. Morris, Walter E. Hope, Frederick H. Osborn, Fordyce B. St. John, James F. Oates, Jr., and John B. Coburn. A few persons have received two honorary degrees. John Gilbert Winant 13 received an A.M. in 1925 while governor of New Hampshire and an LL. D. in 1943 as ambassador to Great Britain. The first woman to receive an honorary degree was Willa Cather (Litt.D. 1931). Ralph J. Bunche, Under\u00ad secretary of the United Nations, was the first black to receive a degree hon\u00ad oris causa (LL. D. 1951).

Honor System, The, has been a cherished tradition at Princeton since its establishment in 1893. While it has undergone some procedural changes, its central principle has been upheld\u2014 that students accept full responsibility for their conduct in written examina\u00ad tions. There is no proctoring; and an examination paper must bear the signed pledge, substantially as it was first drawn: \"I pledge my honor that, during this examination, I have neither given nor received assistance.\" The Honor System had its origin in student dissatisfaction with faculty proctoring of examinations. In 1893 the Daily Princetonian called for the estab\u00ad lishment of a system whereby students would have \"sole charge of examina\u00ad tions.\" Such a plan had been intro\u00ad duced at William and Mary and fol\u00ad lowed at the University of Virginia, where Woodrow Wilson had known it. Princeton student leaders gained the support of Dean James O. Murray, who presented a proposal at a faculty meet\u00ad ing, where Wilson's eloquent plea brought a favorable vote. An immediate success, the Honor System attracted DAVID HOSACK 261 wide attention in the press and on other campuses. In 1895 the first Constitution of the Honor System, not greatly different from the present one, was adopted. It designated an Honor Committee of six, and provided that if a student were found guilty of a violation, the commit\u00ad tee would recommend to the faculty his separation from the College. For con\u00ad viction, two of six votes were required; this was subsequently changed to five of six. By unanimous vote of the stu\u00ad dent body at a mass meeting in 1921 the committee was enlarged to seven members and authorized to recom\u00ad mend leniency in exceptional cases. During the 1920s an attempt was made to extend \"the Spirit of the Honor System\" to \"cover the whole life of the students,\" but it was soon apparent that this would erode the Honor System it\u00ad self, and the scheme was abandoned. Since then the Honor System has applied, as originally intended, only to written examinations. All other cases of misconduct go to the Committee on Discipline, composed of students and faculty members. In 1975 the Constitution was further amended to provide the possibility of a one-year separation as well as perma\u00ad nent separation from the University, to enumerate the rights of the accused, and to place the power to amend the Constitution with the undergraduate governing body rather than a mass meeting. Two long-standing practices, not in the Constitution, have contributed to the strength of the Honor System. Each entering student must state, by personal letter to the Honor Commit\u00ad tee, his willingness to abide by the sys\u00ad tem and to report any violation ob\u00ad served. The latter requirement has often been questioned, but was implicit in the compact between faculty and students in 1893, whereby the students assumed responsibility for the conduct of examinations with the understanding that the individual's responsibility to the undergraduate body as a whole transcends any reluctance to report a fellow student. A second time-honored custom is a meeting of all entering stu\u00ad dents at the beginning of the academic year, at which members of the Honor Committee and an outstanding alum\u00ad nus entrust the Honor System to the new students. The Honor System is less a set of rules than a state of mind\u2014that honesty in examinations is assumed\u2014and is a common bond among Princetonians. Jeremiah S. Finch Hosack, David (1769-1835), a leading physician of his day and an eminent botanist and mineralogist, had strong ties with both Princeton and Columbia. The son of a New York wine merchant who came to America to serve under Lord Jeffery Amherst in the French and Indian War, he attended Columbia for two years and then transferred to Princeton, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1789. He made the change partly to escape from the dis\u00ad tractions of the city, and partly to ob\u00ad tain the benefits of instruction by the distinguished faculty then teaching in Nassau Hall\u2014\"attractions,\" he said, which he \"could not resist.\" He studied medicine, first in New York, then in Philadelphia, where he lived with the family of his favorite teacher Benjamin Rush 1760. He later studied medicine and botany in Edin\u00ad burgh and mineralogy in London, bringing back from Great Britain the 262 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES beginnings of a mineralogical collection that he later gave to Princeton. He was, successively, professor of botany and materia medica at Columbia College, professor of the theory and practice of physic at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, and president of the short-lived Rutgers Medical Col\u00ad lege, which he helped found. Early in his career, he established \"in the vicinity\" of New York\u2014actually where Rockefeller Center now stands\u2014the famous Elgin Botanic Gar\u00ad den, named for his father's birthplace in northern Scotland. Here each year, at the end of the spring term, he held a strawberry festival, in order, he once told another teacher, to let his students see that he was practical as well as theoretical. \"The fragaria is a most ap\u00ad propriate aliment,\" he reminded his skeptical colleague; \"Linnaeus cured his gout and protracted his life by strawberries.\" Among those who par\u00ad took of his strawberries and of his botanical knowledge was John Torrey (q.v.), who later taught botany and chemistry at Princeton and Columbia. Hosack's circle of friends included Aaron Burr, Jr. 1772, and Alexander Hamilton. As the surgeon in attend\u00ad ance at their duel in 1804, he treated Hamilton after he was mortally wounded; and he was one of the pallbearers at Hamilton's funeral. Three years later, after Burr was tried for treason and acquitted, Hosack lent him passage-money to go abroad in order to escape the notoriety resulting from the trial. Princeton awarded Hosack an honor\u00ad ary LL. D. in 1818, and commissioned his portrait by Rembrandt Peale in 1826; it hangs in Upper Eagle Dining Hall. When his friend Bishop John Henry Hobart 1793 died in 1830, Hosack was elected to succeed him as a vice president of the Alumni Associa\u00ad tion of Nassau Hall, of which James Madison was then president. In his time, Hosack was considered one of New York's first citizens. He was influential in social and civic affairs as well as in his profession. He was a founder of the New York Historical So\u00ad ciety and the American Academy of Fine Arts in addition to Bellevue Hos\u00ad pital, and \"his house was the resort of the learned and the enlightened from every part of the world.\" According to one of his medical colleagues, it was often observed by citizens of New York that DeWitt Clinton, Bishop Hobart, and Dr. Hosack were \"the tripod on which our city stood.\" House of Representatives of the United States has not been without a Princeton alumnus in its membership in any year since it first met in 1789. All told, more than 200 Princetonians have represented twenty-eight states and territories in the lower house of Con\u00ad gress. Seven members of the Class of 1805 served in the lower house of Congress, three of them from Georgia. In more recent times, the Class of 1954 con\u00ad tributed three members: William H. Hudnut of Indiana, Donald Rumsfeld of Illinois, and Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland.

(None of the unconfirmed cases was counted in deter\u00ad mining Princeton's record of continued represen\u00ad tation since 1789.) Hudnut, William H. 1886 (1864-1963) was the patriarch of a numerous and distinguished Princeton family. He had two Princeton sons\u2014Herbert B. Hud\u00ad nut '16 and William H. Hudnut, Jr. '27\u2014and seven Princeton grandsons\u2014 Henry Hudnut Bischoff'49, Herbert B. Hudnut, Jr. '53, William H. Hudnut III '54, Robert K. Hudnut .'56, David B. Hudnut '57, Stewart S. Hudnut '61, and Thomas C. Hudnut '69. Both of his sons followed him into the Presbyterian ministry as did two of his grandsons, one of whom, William H. Hudnut IH '54, was congressman from Indiana and later mayor of In\u00ad dianapolis. In a talk at an Alumni Day luncheon in his senior year Stewart S. Hudnut '61 spoke of the strong Presbyterian and Princeton influences in his up\u00ad bringing. His earliest childhood recol\u00ad lection, he said, was of singing two songs, \"Jesus Loves Me\" and \"Going Back to Nassau Hall.\" The year Stewart graduated, the University conferred an honorary de\u00ad gree on his grandfather who was cele\u00ad brating the seventy-fifth anniversary of his graduation. Dr. Hudnut became the oldest living graduate in 1962. Acknowledging word of this distinction, he declared in the Alumni Weekly: \"My lot has been cast with wonderful people and to those that survive I give a cheer. I thank God that my education was in Princeton and I bless the University as it moves into the light.\" He died in 1963 just short of his ninety-ninth birthday. Humanities, The Council of the, was established in 1953 as a means of foster\u00ad ing significant teaching and research in the humanities. Its program was de\u00ad vised by a faculty committee headed by Professor Whitney J. Oates, and includ\u00ad ing Professors Carlos H. Baker, E.B.O. COUNCIL OF THE HUMANITIES 267 Borgerhoff, Donald D. Egbert, George A. Graham, E. Harris Harbison, Harry H. Hess, Arthur K. Parpart, Allen G. Shenstone, E. Baldwin Smith, Joseph R. Strayer, and Ledger Wood. On the premise that there is no study in the University that does not have humanistic aspects, the Council is gov\u00ad erned by a committee consisting of a representative from each of the hu\u00ad manistic departments and also single representatives from the natural sci\u00ad ences, the social sciences, architecture, and engineering. This committee, in addition to its other duties, administers the Councils endowment, determines long-range policy in carrying out its purposes, supervises and coordinates interdepartmental programs in the humanities and nominates Fellows of the Council. Six previously established programs came under the purview of the Council at its founding: the Special Program in the Humanities (superseded in 1964 by the Committee on Humanistic Studies), the Creative Arts Program (later di\u00ad vided into programs in Creative Writ\u00ad ing, Theatre and Dance, and the Visual Arts), the Christian Gauss Seminars in Criticism, and programs in American, European, and Near Eastern studies. Subsequently, the Council helped de\u00ad velop programs in linguistics, classical philosophy, political philosophy, and comparative literature which became a department in 1975. Regarded as the equivalent of \"dis\u00ad tinguished professors,\" Fellows of the Council devote up to half their time to teaching and the balance to research. Their work has led, in many instances, to the development of new teaching programs and to important publica\u00ad tions. During their tenure as Fellows in 1957-1958, English professor Lawrance R. Thompson began his biography of Robert Frost, and politics professor Al-pheus T. Mason brought to completion his work In Quest of Freedom. Two years earlier, historian Charles C. GiI- lispie had used his fellowship to work on an essay in the history of scientific ideas, later published as The Edge of Objectivity, and to prepare and con\u00ad duct a course that eventually led to the University's program in the history and philosophy of science. As Visiting Fellow in 1957-1958, Brown University classicist W. Freeman Twaddell, then president of the Linguistic Society of America, gave courses in linguistics and also acted as adviser to a Humanities Council sub\u00ad committee, which was planning a lin\u00ad guistics program, begun several years later. Another Visiting Fellow, I. I. Rabi, Columbia's Nobel laureate in physics, stimulated the development of a program in Science in Human Affairs and continued to act as its consultant for a number of years. Among other Visiting Fellows have been Martin Buber, Hannah Arendt, Rosamund Tuve, Richard Hofstadter, Reinhold Niebuhr, Erwin Panofsky, Isaiah Ber\u00ad lin, Denis Brogan, Elizabeth Bowen, Anthony Burgess, Rene Wellek, and Philip Roth. A later development has brought the appointment of another group of Visit\u00ad ing Fellows for brief but intensive peri\u00ad ods of one or two weeks. Each of these \"Short-Term Fellows\" undertakes a coordinated program of participation in graduate seminars, departmental col- loquia, public lectures, and other ac\u00ad tivities involving them fully in the Uni\u00ad versity community. In the 1960s the Council sponsored a project to appraise American humanis\u00ad tic scholarship during the preceding several decades. This endeavor, under\u00ad taken on the invitation of the Ford Foundation, which made a $335,000 grant for the purpose, was planned by a 268 ICE HOCKEY subcommittee of the Council; its di\u00ad rector, Rutgers historian Richard Schlatter, and many of the thirty-five scholars who participated were in resi\u00ad dence in Princeton as Fellows of the Council while engaged on the project. Their work resulted in fifteen volumes of The Princeton Studies: Humanistic Schohrship in America, published by Prentice-Hall. In its early years the work of the Council was underwritten by a grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York. Other grants came later from the United States Steel Foundation, the George W. Perkins Foundation, and the Old Dominion Foundation. In 1962 the work of the Council was given added impetus by a $500,000 grant from the Avalon Foundation to endow a chair in the humanities. Chairmen of the Council's inter\u00ad departmental committee have been Whitney J. Oates, professor of classics and first incumbent of the Avalon chair, 1953-1970; Samuel D. Atkins, profes\u00ad sor of classics, 1970-1971; A. Walton Litz, Jr., professor of English, 1971- 1974; and Edward D. Sullivan, profes\u00ad sor of French and comparative litera\u00ad ture and Oates's successor as Avalon professor, since 1974. Ice hockey came into prominence at Princeton at the turn of the century. In those early days, the game consisted of two twenty-minute halves, and play was slower (there was a good deal of high lofting of the puck by the defense men), but according to Gresham Poe '02, one of the first Varsity players, much excitement was generated by bodychecking, \"which was immensely enjoyed by the customers.\" The teams worked out on Stony Brook whenever it froze over but, because of the milder New Jersey winters, they had fewer chances for practice than their New England rivals. Princeton was one of the founding members of an intercollegiate hockey league, which started in 1899. The first three championships of this league were won by Yale, the next three by Harvard. In 1907, when newly com\u00ad pleted Lake Carnegie provided a better place for practice, Princeton gave Har\u00ad vard its first defeat in four years, and won its first championship. Princeton won its second championship in 1910, when goaltender Clarence N. Peacock 10 allowed league opponents only two goals in five games, and rover Alfred G. Kay 12 scored half of Princeton's twelve goals. Princeton took the championship again in 1912 and 1914, narrowly miss\u00ad ing out in 1913, when it lost two out of three games to Harvard. This was Princeton's golden age of hockey, high\u00ad lighted by the brilliant play of Hobey Baker '14, universally recognized at that time as the greatest amateur hockey player ever developed in the United States. Playing rover (a position eliminated in 1921, when hockey teams were reduced from seven to six players), he thrilled spectators with his ability to weave his way through the opposing team, change his pace and di\u00ad rection, and send the puck speeding into the net. Baker, who served with distinction as a pilot and squadron commander with the A.E.F. in the First World War, was killed in an airplane crash soon after the armistice and just before his scheduled return to America. With funds con\u00ad tributed by his Princeton friends and admirers from many other colleges, Princeton built the Hobart Baker Memorial Rink (q.v.), which was dedi\u00ad cated on January 6, 1923. Princeton had many fine teams in the INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS SECTION 269 twenties and thirties, especially those in 1923 (12 victories, 5 defeats, and one tie), 1924 (11-6), 1929 (15-3-1), 1931 (14-5), 1932 (13-4-1) and 1933 (15-4); but it had to wait until 1941 for another championship. That year Princeton took first place in the Quadrangular League over Dartmouth, Harvard, and Yale, and the Hobey Baker Memorial Trophy came home for the first time since it was put up in 1934. Dan Stuck- ey '42 was the leading scorer on a team that was further remarkable for having in its line-up two sets of brothers: Cap\u00ad tain George Young '41 and Don Young \"43, and twins Bill and Jim Sloane '43. Hockey suffered a four-year hiatus when Baker Rink was boarded over for use as a gym between the loss of the University Gymnasium by fire in 1944 and the completion of Dillon in 1947. Six years later Princeton had suffi\u00ad ciently recovered its momentum to win the Pentagonal League championship over Brown, Dartmouth, Harvard, and Yale. The 1953 championship was due, in no small part, to the leadership of the captain, Ail-American center Hank Bothfeld, who set a three-year Prince\u00ad ton record of 103 points (i.e. the total of goals and assists), while drawing only three penalties. This team also in\u00ad cluded two brothers, Bill Gall '53, who set a one-season Princeton record of 40 points in 1951, and Peter Gall '54. Bothfeld's career record was broken in 1960 by John McBride '60, who made 118 points in three years; he also bettered Gall's one-season record twice, raising it in 1959 to 44 points, and in 1960 to 54 points. McBride's three-year record was surpassed in 1963 by Johnny Cook '63, who during his varsity career made a total of 132 goals and assists. In the sixties the 1968 team was out\u00adstanding; it had a 13-10-1 record and qualified for the E.C.A.C. post-season tournament, but lost there to Cornell, whose All-American goalie was the re\u00ad nowned Ken Dryden. Keene Fitzpatrick, well-known track coach and football trainer, was Princeton's first hockey coach; he di\u00ad rected the three teams that Hobey Baker played on. Best known of his successors were three Ivy League products: Pudge Neidlinger, Dart\u00ad mouth '23; Dick Vaughan, Yale '28; and Norm Wood, Harvard '54. Vaughan coached from 1935 through 1959, far longer than anyone else. A devoted student of the game, in 1939 he pub\u00ad lished a book on hockey that has been widely used by other coaches. In recent years two former professional players have been coaches: John Wilson of De\u00ad troit and the New York Rangers, from 1965 to 1967, and Bill Quackenbush of Detroit and Boston, from 1967 to 1973. Jack Semler, University of Vermont '68, was coach from 1973 to 1977 and was succeeded by Jim Higgins, Boston University '63, previously coach at Colgate. A women's ice hockey team, first or\u00ad ganized in 1972-1973, improved stead\u00ad ily and in 1977 finished second in the Ivy League. Industrial Relations Section. At Prince\u00ad ton industrial relations connotes a broad range of interests and activities. Within its traditional orbit are the areas of per\u00ad sonnel administration, unionism, col\u00ad lective bargaining, the economics of the labor market, and management or\u00ad ganization and development, as well as company benefit plans and government social security programs. More re\u00ad cently, the Industrial Relations Section has broadened its scope to include analysis of manpower and educational 270 INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS SECTION systems in developing countries, the financing of education in the United States, race relations and discrimina\u00ad tion in employment, and the new and expanding area of economics known as \"investment-in-man\" or human capital. The Industrial Relations Section it\u00ad self was inaugurated in 1922, at the suggestion of Clarence J. Hicks of the Standard Oil Company (New Jersey). Hicks, a pioneer in the progressive movement of personnel administration in large-scale industry, was instrumen\u00ad tal in securing funds from John D. Rockefeller, Jr., to establish the section on a trial basis. Later Rockefeller pro\u00ad vided a permanent endowment, and his son, John D. Rockefeller III, provided additional funds, which were subse\u00ad quently augmented by contributions from over sixty companies and six na\u00ad tional unions. By 1975, the section's annual income from endowment was well over $150,000, and additional funds were being provided by founda\u00ad tion and government grants for specific projects. The section has had five directors. Robert F. Foerster was called from Harvard to start the enterprise. He was succeeded in 1926 by J. Douglas Brown, who, in a very real sense, was the section's philosopher, prime mover, and builder. He developed its program, inspired its researchers, raised money for its endowment, and was its guiding spirit for nearly thirty years. He was succeeded by Frederick H. (Fizz) Harbison, who served as di\u00ad rector from 1955 to 1968; since then Albert Rees and Orley Ashenfelter have alternately served as director. Throughout its history, the section has functioned as a clearinghouse of in\u00ad formation for students, business exec\u00ad utives, union leaders, and government officials. It has the oldest and one of the best industrial relations library services in the country, provides financial sup\u00ad port for the research of graduate stu\u00ad dents and faculty members, and is the workshop for hundreds of under\u00ad graduates writing course papers and senior theses. It has always been housed in the university library, since 1948 in space provided by a gift from the Class of 1926. Outside of Princeton, the section was probably best known for its annual fall Conference on Industrial Relations. For over twenty years, starting in 1931, these conferences, artfully led by J. Douglas Brown, were revered by the blue-chip corporations in America as a strategic instrument in development of personnel administration and the management of human resources in in\u00ad dustry. Later, as other organizations expanded their activity in this area, the section turned to conferences on major issues in public policy and on research in the various branches of industrial re\u00ad lations. The contributions of members of the section's core group have been numer\u00ad ous and significant. Brown was one of the principal architects of our nation's social security system. Richard A. Les\u00ad ter's research and government service in collective bargaining, social security, manpower economics, and employ\u00ad ment of women are held in the highest esteem. Harbison was a pioneer in the formulation and testing of \"the man\u00ad power approach\" to educational plan\u00ad ning in developing countries. Brown, Lester, and Harbison helped organize and were subsequently presidents of the Industrial Relations Research Asso\u00ad ciation. William G. Bowen made sig\u00ad nificant contributions to the theory of wages. Ashenfelter has been a leading figure particularly in the measurement of racial and minority discrimination in INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY 271 industrial employment. And Albert Rees was called in 1974 by President Ford to head the nation's Council on Wages and Prices. Last, mention needs to be made of the contributions of several of these men in the central administration of the University. J. Douglas Brown became dean of the faculty and later provost. Richard A. Lester was also dean of the faculty. William G. Bowen became provost and later president. Albert Rees was also provost. One might con\u00ad clude with good reason that the associa\u00ad tion of these men with industrial rela\u00ad tions at Princeton explains, at least in part, their excellent record of perform\u00ad ance as university administrators. Frederick H. Harbison Institute for Advanced Study, The, al\u00ad though organically and administratively separate from Princeton University, has had, since its founding in 1930, close academic and intellectual rela\u00ad tions with the University. Originally housed in Fine Hall, it soon developed its own institutional center in a square mile of beautifully wooded land at the southern edge of Princeton beyond the Graduate College and near the battlefield. The Institute's primary purpose has been \"the pursuit of ad\u00ad vanced learning and exploration in fields of pure science and high scholarship.\" It awards no degrees and usually admits to membership scholars who have already taken their highest degree. The first director of the Institute was Abraham Flexner, who was succeeded in 1939 by Frank Aydelotte, in 1947 by Robert Oppenheimer, in 1966 by Carl Kaysen, and in 1976 by Harry Woolf. The Institute's endowment, provided by Louis Bamberger and his sister Mrs. Felix FuId, is administered by a board of trustees of fifteen members. Since its earliest years, the Institute has held an eminent position in the fields of pure mathematics and mathe\u00ad matical physics. Albert Einstein and John von Neumann were among the creative leaders on its distinguished faculty. As years have passed, the Insti\u00ad tute has expanded its areas of coverage. While the members of the School of Mathematics remain for the most part pure mathematicians, the members of the School of Natural Sciences are gen\u00ad erally theoretical physicists, as\u00ad trophysicists, and astronomers, with some who have worked in other sci\u00ad ences such as chemistry, biology, and psychology. The School of Historical Studies is broader in scope, including all learning for which the use of the his\u00ad torical method is a principal instru\u00ad ment. The major interests of the faculty have, however, been in Greek archae\u00ad ology, philosophy and philology; Ro\u00ad man history; medieval history; and the history of philosophy and science. The School of Social Science is of more re\u00ad cent origin and has emphasized the use of the methods and perspectives of the various social sciences with the aim of elucidating the processes of social change. The professors of the Institute carry on their scholarly work without having to offer formal courses or give examina\u00ad tions. Rather, the emphasis is upon the informal interaction of scholars in a community of scholars. The Institute provides facilities for residence and study for approximately one hundred and fifty visiting members who are admitted each year for short periods to pursue scholarly projects away from their normal duties at their home institutions. These visiting mem\u00ad bers come from all parts of America, 272 INTERNATIONAL FINANCE SECTION with approximately a third from Europe and Asia. While the Institute maintains resi\u00ad dential and other facilities necessary for academic life and provides the oppor\u00ad tunities for continuing intellectual in\u00ad teraction within its own community of scholars, it also gains from a symbiotic relationship with the University, with its wider range of disciplines and larger faculty. A small, working library at the Institute is buttressed by the libraries of the University, to which Institute members have full access. There is much opportunity for inter\u00ad change and cooperation on an informal basis between the faculties of the Uni\u00ad versity and the Institute, and the Princeton academic community has been enriched not only by the presence of distinguished members of the Insti\u00ad tute's permanent faculty, but also by a flow of internationally recognized visit\u00ad ing scholars. J. Douglas Brown International Finance Section, The, which is associated with the Depart\u00ad ment of Economics, was established in 1929 to provide research as well as re\u00ad search training in a field of increasing importance in world affairs. Its first di\u00ad rector, Edwin W. Kemmerer, had been chairman of commissions to stabilize the finances of ten countries on five continents. He had noticed a scarcity of qualified specialists and found that Princeton was singularly well equipped to train the needed experts. The section was funded chiefly by a gift of $490,000 from Gerard B. Lam\u00ad bert '08 and his family in memory of James Theodore Walker '27, who died in an airplane accident two days after his graduation. Additional gifts, includ\u00ad ing $20,000 from Kemmerer himself, together with funds transferred from general endowment, gave the Walker Foundation of International Finance a value of $690,000 in 1930. Its income has financed the section and the Walker Professorship of Economics and Inter\u00ad national Finance. During the early years Frank Duns- tan Graham, Frank Whitson Fetter, and Charles Ray Whittlesey were asso\u00ad ciated with Kemmerer, who was both Walker Professor and director of the section. After Kemmerer's death in 1945, Graham became Walker Profes\u00ad sor. In 1949, Gardner Patterson was brought in to direct the section; associ\u00ad ated with him in its research were Friedrich A. Lutz, and Jacob Viner, who on Graham's death in 1949, be\u00ad came Walker Professor. Patterson relinquished the director\u00ad ship in 1958, and Viner retired as Walker Professor in 1960. Thereupon, the two positions were reunited: Fritz Machlup was called from Johns Hop\u00ad kins to serve in both capacities. On Machlup's retirement in 1971, Peter B. Kenen, called from Columbia, assumed both positions. The major achievements of the sec\u00ad tion are threefold: (1) research and re\u00ad search training, (2) publications of sin\u00ad gular importance and timeliness, and (3) organization of conferences with great influence on governmental and inter\u00ad governmental policies. The research findings of the directors and associates of the section have been published in five different series of essays, papers, and studies, as well as in scores of books and articles. Probably no other single source of knowledge on international financial affairs has been more exten\u00ad sively used and cited by scholars and writers in this field than the publica\u00ad tions of the section. The usefulness of the conferences is CENTER OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES 273 demonstrated by the number of top officials of national governments and international organizations who partici\u00ad pate. The \"Joint Conference of Officials and Academics on International Mone\u00ad tary Reform,\" first convened in BeI- lagio, Italy, and widely known as the Bellagio Group, met eighteen times be\u00ad tween 1964 and 1977, in Bellagio, Washington, and Princeton, as well as in eight other European centers. Another series of conferences, held in Burgenstock, Switzerland, which be\u00ad came known as the Burgenstock Group, included also practitioners from the private sector\u2014executives of com\u00ad mercial banks and multinational corpo\u00ad rations. Both types of conferences have been credited with having had a whole\u00ad some influence on international negoti\u00ad ations in monetary affairs. Fritz Machlup International Studies, The Center of, traces its antecedents to the Yale Insti\u00ad tute of International Studies (1935- 1951), whose director, Frederick S. Dunn '14, came to Princeton with seven associates in 1951. First incumbent of the Milbank Professorship of Interna\u00ad tional Law and Practice, Dunn was di\u00ad rector of the Center until he retired in 1961 when he was succeeded as di\u00ad rector by Klaus Knorr (public affairs), who had come with him from Yale. Cyril E. Black (history) became third director in 1968. The Center, which draws its mem\u00ad bership from Princeton faculty and pre-doctoral students and visiting scholars from other institutions, en\u00ad courages research in two interrelated fields\u2014international relations (e.g., studies of world order, foreign policy, military affairs) and national develop\u00ad ment (studies of comparative politics and of modernization in countries at various levels of development). The Center's members include economists, historians, and sociologists as well as political scientists, and many of its group research projects involve mul- tidisciplinary, comparative, and cross- cultural approaches. The Center's Program in World Order Studies, which focuses on prob\u00ad lems associated with developing a just and peaceful world order, was estab\u00ad lished in 1970 with a grant from Ran\u00ad dolph P. Compton '15 and Mrs. Comp- ton. Younger scholars are awarded predoctoral and postdoctoral fellow\u00ad ships named for the Comptons' son John Parker Compton '47, who was killed in World War II. One of this program's first projects, \"The Future of the International Legal Order,\" was directed by Cyril Black and Richard A. FaIk (Dunn's successor as Milbank Professor), with the par- ticipaton of some forty scholars from twenty-eight institutions in this country and abroad. In 1973, the first four vol\u00ad umes that had resulted from this proj\u00ad ect received the Annual Award of the American Society of International Law, which cited the editors for having \"per\u00ad suaded some of the world's ablest minds to apply their highest talents to our most important problems.\" Additional research and publication at the Center has involved a broad range of topics, including the modern\u00ad ization of Japan and Russia, the mod\u00ad ernization of China, thermonuclear war, the politics of developing areas, revolution, guerilla warfare, problems of ecology. Besides issuing research monographs and policy memoranda from time to time, the Center sponsors World Poli\u00ad tics, an academic quarterly in interna\u00ad tional relations and national develop-274 IVY LEAGUE ment which political scientists rated highest in quality among sixty-three professional journals in its field in a 1975 survey. Ninety books were writ\u00ad ten under the Center's auspices during its first quarter century, half of them by scholars from other institutions in this country and abroad. Support of the Center has been pro\u00ad vided by income from an endowment, by appropriations from the Woodrow Wilson School, and by University gen\u00ad eral funds. The Center has also re\u00ad ceived support from the Rockefeller, Ford, and Compton Foundations, from the Carnegie Corporation, from nu\u00ad merous individual gifts, and from vari\u00ad ous research agencies of the federal government. Ivy League is the name generally applied to eight universities (Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Har\u00ad vard, Pennsylvania, Princeton, and Yale) that over the years have had common interests in scholarship as well as in athletics. Stanley Woodward, New York Herald Tribune sports writer, coined the phrase in the early thirties. In 1936 the undergraduate news\u00ad papers of these universities simulta\u00ad neously ran an editorial advocating the formation of an \"Ivy League,\" but the first move toward this end was not taken until 1945. In that year, the eight presidents entered into an agreement \"for the purpose of reaffirming their in\u00ad tention of continuing intercollegiate football in such a way as to maintain the values of the game, while keeping it in fitting proportion to the main purposes of academic life.\" To achieve this objec\u00ad tive two inter-university committees were appointed: one, made up prima\u00ad rily of the college deans, was to ad\u00ad minister rules of eligibility; the other, composed of the athletic directors, was to establish policies on the length of the playing season and of preseason prac\u00ad tice, operating budgets, and related matters. Two other inter-university committees on admission and financial aid were added later. As President Dodds pointed out at the time, the general principles agreed on by the eight universities were essen\u00ad tially the same as those set forth in the Harvard-Yale-Princeton Presidents' Agreement of 1916 (see Big Three). The first step toward organizing full league competition came in 1952 with the announcement that, beginning with the fall of 1953, each college would play every other college in the group at least once every five years. This plan was superseded in 1954 when the presi\u00ad dents announced the adoption of a yearly round-robin schedule in football, starting in 1956, and approved the principle of similar schedules in \"as many sports as practicable.\" Thereafter, the Ivy Group (as the league was called in the Presidents' Agreement of 1954) established schedules in other sports, including some in existing leagues with non-Ivy members. As of 1977, the Ivy League colleges competed, round-robin, in football, soccer, basketball, and, with certain variations as noted, in baseball (also Army and Navy), fencing (except Brown and Dartmouth), ice hockey (except Columbia), squash (except Brown, Columbia, and Cornell), swim\u00ad ming (except Columbia, but also Army and Navy), tennis (also Army and Navy), and wrestling (except Brown and Dartmouth). Ivy championships in cross-country and track were deter\u00ad mined at the annual Heptagonal Meets, in golf at an Ivy championship tourna\u00ad ment, and in rowing at the Eastern As\u00ad sociation of Rowing Colleges Regatta. The mid-seventies brought the inclu-JADWIN GYMNASIUM 275 sion of women's teams in the Ivy League program with the institution of championship tournaments in basket\u00ad ball and ice hockey, and a move to\u00ad ward round-robin competition in field hockey, lacrosse, and other sports. Other instances of increasing formal\u00ad ization of the Ivy League occurred in the seventies\u2014two of them involving Princetonians. Since 1971, the Bushnell Cup has been awarded to the Ivy football player of the year, who is selected by vote of the eight coaches. This trophy, pre\u00ad sented to the Ivy League by the East\u00ad ern Association of Intercollegiate Foot\u00ad ball Officials, was named in honor of Asa S. Bushnell '21, the first commis\u00ad sioner of the Eastern College Athletic Conference, in appreciation of \"his great contribution to the advancement of college athletics.\" In 1973, to provide greater coordina\u00ad tion of the athletic interests of the eight universities, the post of executive di\u00ad rector of the Council of Ivy League Presidents was created, and Ricardo A. Mestres '31, financial vice-president and treasurer of the University, emeritus, was elected first incumbent. Mestres served in this post until 1976, when he was succeeded by James M. Litvack, visiting lecturer in economics and public affairs in the University. Jadwin Gymnasium is a memorial to Leander Stockwell Jadwin '28, who was captain of the track team his senior year and who died of injuries suffered in an automobile accident in New York eight months after his graduation. He was, his teammate John McG. Dalenz '28 said at the gymnasium's dedication forty years later, \"a young man who was dedicated but light-hearted, accom\u00ad plished with great modesty, com\u00ad Dalenz re\u00ad lated, Jadwin went to New York to run in an A. A. U. indoor track meet. The next morning when his roommates asked him how he had done, he re\u00ad plied, \"Oh, I didn't do so badly.\" It wasn't until they saw the headline in the New York Times that they realized the extent of his understatement: \"Princeton's Jadwin Ties High Hurdle World Record.\" When Jadwin's mother died in 1965, she left the University an unrestricted bequest of $27 million, and because the Jadwin family had some years earlier expressed an interest in a fieldhouse for indoor track and had made a substantial contribution for this purpose, the trus\u00ad tees decided to use part of the Jadwin legacy to complete the funds needed for a $6.5 million multipurpose athletic building and to name it for Stockwell Jadwin. Ground was broken for the Jadwin Gymnasium in 1964, and construction was completed in 1969. At its dedica\u00ad tion President Goheen called it a trib\u00ad ute to the director of athletics, R. Ken\u00ad neth Fairman '34, who had \"had a vi\u00ad sion of what Princeton needed in the way of a multipurpose gymnasium and had put himself into the building of it.\" Situated just below the open end of Palmer Stadium on a hillside overlook\u00ad ing Lake Carnegie, Jadwin Gymnasium is one of the University's largest struc\u00ad tures, with more than enough total floor space to enclose eight football fields; it is also one of its most versatile buildings, providing year-round facili\u00ad ties for competition and practice in ten sports and for convocations, concerts, and lectures. Designed by Walker O. Cain & As\u00ad sociates, Jadwin has two primary levels beneath a roof formed by three inter\u00ad locking shells. On the upper level the 276 JADWIN GYMNASIUM first shell covers the entrance lobby. The area beneath the middle shell con\u00ad tains the main basketball court and four practice courts. Using temporary bleachers to supplement the fixed seats in the balcony, 7,500 spectators can be accommodated at a basketball game. At other non-athletic events, as many as 10,000 can be seated. The area beneath the third shell to the south contains an eight-laps-to-the-mile Tartan track, with a 310-foot straightaway and pole vault, high jump, and long jump loca\u00ad tions, which can be converted into four indoor tennis courts. The lower level has a large dirt floor for shot-put and weight-throw events in winter track meets, for indoor baseball practice in the early spring, and for in\u00ad door football, lacrosse, or soccer prac\u00ad tice, when needed. Adjacent are six bituminous-surfaced tennis courts. Intermediate levels beneath the en\u00ad trance lobby contain a fencing room, a wrestling room, and thirteen squash racquets courts with spectator galleries. Jadwin is Princeton's fifth gymna\u00ad sium. Efforts to provide a suitable place \"for the bracing of the bodily frame\" (President McCosh's phrase) began in 1837 when a group of students in the Class of 1839 fitted up a gymnasium of sorts in an old building just off campus, but it was discontinued after they graduated. The first gymnasium for the whole college\u2014a stoveless, wooden, barn-like structure\u2014was put up in 1859 near where Witherspoon now stands. Half the $984.31 cost was paid by students, half by the faculty. It was equipped with second-hand parallel and horizon\u00ad tal bars, pulleys with weights, a few swings with hand rings, and a mattress or two, bought for $50 from a gym\u00ad nasium in Trenton that had gone out of business. Primitive though it was, stu\u00addents found it a good place \"to loosen the joints and strengthen the limbs stif\u00ad fened by study\" until one night during the summer of 1865 when townspeople burned it to the ground after hearing a rumor that a tramp suffering from smallpox had been sleeping there. The College's second gymnasium, a gray stone building, was built in 1869, near the site of Campbell Hall, at a cost of $38,000, shared equally by Robert Bonner and Henry G. Marquand. A modest affair by today's standards (in\u00ad side it was a little smaller than a regulation-size basketball court), it was considered the finest gymnasium in the country when it was built, and its bars, rings, trapezes, ladders, weights, clubs, bells, and ropes were put to con\u00ad stant and effective use by student gym\u00ad nasts for more than thirty years. The Bonner-Marquand gym had two celebrated accessories: at its front a bronze statue of a gladiator, in its basement the College's first bathtubs. The gladiator, whose only adornments were a sword, a shield and a fig-leaf, was a favorite butt of student pranks; once when Anthony Comstock, secre\u00ad tary of the Society for the Suppression of Vice, came to give a public lecture, he found the gladiator decorously clothed in red flannel underwear. The dozen enameled iron tubs in \"the murky steaming depths\" of the base\u00ad ment were difficult to get to and un\u00ad comfortable to use. So much so, that it was the custom at that time (when sophomores had to pass a \"biennial\" examination on the work of the first two years) to observe, on meeting a class\u00ad mate who had a conspicuously well- scrubbed appearance, \"Ah, I see you have taken your biennial.\" The Bonner-Marquand Gymnasium was razed in 1907 to make way for Campbell Hall. Meantime, the Univer-THE PAPERS OF THOMAS JEFFERSON 277 sity Gymnasium had been built in 1903 by general alumni subscriptions. A connecting building contained a swim\u00ad ming pool, which had been built in the early 1890s in memory of Frederick Brokaw 1892, a varsity baseball catcher, who had lost his life trying to save a drowning girl. For four decades the University Gymnasium was used for physical education, athletic con\u00ad tests, student dances, and alumni din\u00ad ners. It was destroyed by fire in 1944, and replaced in 1947 by Dillon Gym\u00ad nasium (q.v.). Jadwin Hall, headquarters of the De\u00ad partment of Physics, was dedicated in 1970 as a memorial to Stanley Palmer Jadwin, whose widow on her death in 1964 left $27 million\u2014virtually the en\u00ad tire family estate\u2014to the University. Portions of this gift were used for the construction of the gymnasium in memory of her son, L. Stockwell Jad\u00ad win '28 (q.v.), as well as for the mathematics-physics-statistics center, represented by Jadwin Hall and Fine Hall (q.v.). Jadwin and Fine Halls stand just west of Palmer Stadium and southwest of Peyton Hall and are connected by a joint library located beneath the plaza between them. Counting the two levels beneath the plaza, Jadwin Hall has al\u00ad together six floors, containing ninety laboratories, eighty-four offices, and eight classrooms. On the main floor is a meeting room for the physics faculty named for Princeton's first physicist, Joseph Henry, and adjacent to it a lounge named for its donor, Peter A. Ballentine '35. Jadwin Hall was designed by Hugh Stubbins & Associates of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Its basic construction, like Fine Hall's, is of reinforced con\u00ad crete and steel, and the principal ex\u00adterior materials are Canadian granite and brick. The plaza is paved with a stone known as London Walk. Jefferson, Thomas, The Papers of, \"one of the greatest editorial and pub\u00ad lishing ventures in the nation's his\u00ad tory,\" had its genesis at the time of Jef\u00ad ferson's 200th birthday in 1943. The project, President Dodds said, was \"truly the child of the creative imagina\u00ad tion\" of Julian P. Boyd, University Li\u00ad brarian, later Professor of History, who was then serving as historian to the Thomas Jefferson Bicentennial Com\u00ad mission. Encouraged by the commis\u00ad sion's warm endorsement and a gift of $200,000 from the New York Times Company, the University assumed editorial responsibility as sponsor of the project, and Princeton University Press agreed to publish the sixty-volume series. Other contributions have come from the Ford Foundation, the National Historical Publications and Records Commission, and individual donors. Invaluable assistance has been given by the Library of Congress, the Library of the University of Virginia, the National Archives, and upwards of 600 archival and historical institutions and private collectors all over the world. The Papers, when completed, will include 18,000 letters written by Jeffer\u00ad son, 25,000 letters written to him, his public papers, and all his writings on the varied topics his wide-ranging mind touched upon\u2014in Professor Gilbert Chinard's words, \"the richest treasure house of historical information ever left by a single man.\" Julian Boyd has been editor of the Papers from the beginning. Serving as associate editors for a time were Mrs. Mina R. Bryan (1944-1956) and Lyman H. Butterfield (1946-1951). Douglas Southall Freeman was chairman of the 278 JONES HALL advisory committee from 1944 to 1953, Fiske Kimball from 1953 to 1955, David K. E. Bruce 19 from 1955 to 1977. The first of the volumes appeared in 1950; by 1974 nineteen had been pub\u00ad lished, winning wide critical acclaim for their thorough editing, impeccable scholarship, and beautiful design. They also served as the prototype for such projects as the Hamilton Papers at Co\u00ad lumbia, the Franklin Papers at Yale, the Adams Papers (edited by Lyman H. Butterfield) at the Massachusetts His\u00ad torical Society, the Madison Papers at Chicago and Virginia, and the Wilson Papers at Princeton\u2014the first fruits of what the eminent historian Adrienne Koch called \"a bloodless revolution in American historiography.\" The \"revo\u00ad lution\" had begun with President Dodds's presentation of the first vol\u00ad ume of the Jefferson Papers to Presi\u00ad dent Truman, who issued an Executive order committing the National Histori\u00ad cal Publications and Records Commis\u00ad sion to a national program of documen\u00ad tary publication which has enabled 200 different projects to undertake publica\u00ad tion of the records of Americans in all fields of endeavor. Jefferson visited Princeton in 1783 as a member of the Continental Congress, which met that year in Nassau Hall. Princeton gave him an honorary LL. D. in 1791; as President Dodds has pointed out, the College showed a fine sense of balance by awarding the same degree at the same time to Alexander Hamilton. Jefferson gave Princeton $100 toward rebuilding Nassau Hall after the fire of 1802. Jones Hall, designed by Charles Z. Klauder, was built in 1930 as the first home of the mathematics department. It was originally named in memory of the departments founding chairman, Dean Henry B. Fine (q.v.). When the new Fine Hall was completed in 1969, the old one was renamed in honor of its donors, Thomas D. Jones and his niece Gwethalyn Jones, and made the home of the Departments of East Asian and Near Eastern Studies. Thomas Jones and his older brother David, sons of a farmer from Wales who settled in Wisconsin in 1850, shared first honors at graduation from Princeton in 1876. Both were lawyers in Chicago and became wealthy in the practice of their profession and in busi\u00ad ness. Both were trustees of the Univer\u00ad sity and strong supporters of Woodrow Wilson when he was its president. In 1907, when the cornerstone of Palmer Hall was laid, the Jones brothers gave a $200,000 endowment for the physics and electrical engineer\u00ad ing departments. In the late twenties, Thomas Jones and Gwethalyn Jones (daughter of David, who died in 1923) were the University's most generous benefactors when it was seeking $2,000,000 for scientific research to match a conditional $1,000,000 gift from the General Education Board. Thomas gave professorships in mathe\u00ad matics and in physics to express \"the debt of gratitude\" he owed Henry Bur- chard Fine and Cyrus Fogg Brackett \"as teachers and friends. \"At the same time, Gwethalyn endowed a chair in chemistry in memory of her father and another in mathematical physics in honor of her uncle. Two years later, they gave an additional $500,000 with which to supplement the income from the four $200,000 chairs in case salaries had to be raised, because, Jones said, his niece and he could not \"comfortably contemplate the possibility that the University might have to forego the EDWIN WALTER KEMMERER 279 services of men of the very first rank for these professorships.\" In 1928 Jones agreed to be one of ten alumni to subscribe $100,000 each to the $2 million Alumni Fund for Fac\u00ad ulty Salaries. He said he felt that it was only fair that the largest part of this fund should come from those \"who have what I may loosely call superflu\u00ad ous wealth,\" rather than from those \"who have their hands full supporting their families.\" Unable to secure the nine other subscribers, the Committee suggested that Jones make his subscrip\u00ad tion conditional on the completion of the entire fund. Jones declined this honor and, instead, made his subscrip\u00ad tion unconditional. \"I am not a general education board,\" he wrote \"and I do not quite like the pose of insisting that I shall have the privilege of placing the finial on the completed fund.\" Jones later provided in his will for a $500,000 bequest for faculty salaries. Shortly after Dean Fine's death, in 1929, Jones and his niece provided for the erection of a mathematics building in his memory (the original Fine Hall, now Jones Hall), and, what was rarer, an endowment for its upkeep. Feeling that \"nothing is too good for Harry Fine,\" Jones said that the building to bear his name should be a place which \"any mathematician would be loath to leave.\" The finished building provided spacious wood-panelled library, com\u00ad mon rooms, and faculty studies. It also contained a locker room with shower- bath for faculty wishing to use the then-nearby tennis courts; this amenity inspired these lines about the depart\u00ad ment chairman in the Faculty Song: He's built a country-club for Math Where you can even take a bath. Loath as the mathematicians were to leave, in 1969 the increased size of the department compelled them to move into the new Fine Hall, leaving their marks in the old one\u2014mathematical formulas and figures in the leaded de\u00ad sign of the windows, and Einstein's fa\u00ad mous remark over the fireplace in what is now the Lounge: Rafliniert ist der Herr Gott, aber Boshaft ist Er nicht (God is subtle, but He is not malicious). Kemmerer, Edwin Walter (1875-1945), first Walker Professor of Economics and International Finance, developed an interest in monetary theory during his student days. At Wesleyan Univer\u00ad sity he devoted his senior thesis to a de\u00ad fense of the quantity theory of money, and in his doctoral dissertation at Cor\u00ad nell he devised statistical methods to support his arguments. In 1903, on re\u00ad ceiving his Ph.D., he was appointed financial adviser to the United States Philippines Commission. In this capac\u00ad ity he drafted the currency law of the Islands and put them on the gold ex\u00ad change standard, thus inaugurating a lifetime career as an international \"money doctor.\" Between 1917 and 1934 he served as financial adviser to the governments of Mexico and Guatemala, and headed financial mis\u00ad sions to Colombia, South Africa, Chile, Poland, Ecuador, Bolivia, China, Peru, and Turkey. In 1924 he was banking and monetary expert to the Dawes Commission on European reparations. Kemmerer came to Princeton from Cornell in 1912, joining Frank A. Fet\u00ad ter (q.v.), who had come from Ithaca a year earlier. In 1929 he helped estab\u00ad lish the International Finance Section (q.v.), contributed to its endowment, and became its first director as well as first Walker Professor, serving in these positions until his retirement in 1943. He wrote more than a dozen books. Perhaps the most important for other 280 JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY economists was his Modern Currency Reforms (1916). Best known was The A B C of the Federal Reserve System (1918), which ran to twelve editions. Among the honors bestowed on him were the presidency of the American Economic Association; election to the American Philosophical Society and to the American Academy of Arts and Sci\u00ad ences; decorations by the governments of Belgium, Colombia, Ecuador, and Poland; and honorary degrees from universities in Bolivia and Ecuador as well as from Columbia, Occidental, Oglethorpe, Rutgers, and Wesleyan. One distinction that especially de\u00ad lighted him was the honorary mem\u00ad bership the Princeton Class of 1916 voted him because he and they \"were Freshmen together.\" He left bequests to the three univer\u00ad sities with which he had been con\u00ad nected\u2014Wesleyan, Cornell, and Princeton. Kennedy, John Fitzgerald (1917-1963), 35th president of the United States (1961-1963), was admitted to Princeton in 1935, as a member of the Class of 1939. He fell ill with jaundice in Lon\u00ad don that summer and did not matricu\u00ad late until October 26, 1935, a month after college opened, and withdrew on December 12, 1935, because of a recur\u00ad rence of jaundice. He later entered Harvard from which he graduated cum laude in 1940. While at Princeton he roomed in 9 South Reunion with Kirk LeMoyne Billings '39 and Ralph Hor- ton, Jr. '39. Reunion Hall, condemned as a fire hazard, was torn down in 1965. Bricks from the fireplace in their living room, rescued by his classmates, frame a bronze plaque about him in the south entry of the Class of 1939 Dormitory. In his application for admission he wrote: \"To be a Princeton Man is in\u00ad deed an enviable distinction.\" Lacrosse, which originated among North American Indians and was adopted and developed by the French in Canada\u2014they called the stick with which they played \"la crosse\" because it reminded them of a bishop's crosier\u2014was introduced to the United States by two Canadian teams in a series of exhibition matches in 1877. Columbia, Harvard, and New York University took up the game in 1880; Princeton followed in 1881; and an in\u00ad tercollegiate lacrosse association was organized by the four in 1882. Yale joined later. Harvard was dominant in the 1880s, winning the championship six years out of nine. Princeton won the title in 1884, 1888, 1889, and then gave up the sport a year later because of the lack of space for practice (in competition with baseball and track), and the feeling that lacrosse's training value for other sports\u2014its chief appeal at the beginning\u2014had been overestimated. Harland W. Meistrell '25, star la\u00ad crosse player from Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, revived lacrosse at Princeton in 1921, as he had previously done at Rutgers before transferring to Princeton. A trophy bearing his name is awarded to the winner of the annual Rutgers-Princeton game. Princeton won championships in 1924, 1926, and 1929, and enjoyed three successive undefeated seasons in 1933, 1934, and 1935. The undefeated 1937 team shared the national championship with Mary\u00ad land; the undefeated 1942 team won it outright. Two players of this period died in World War II: John E. Higgin- botham '39, captain his senior year, and MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE 281 Tyler Campbell '43, All-American de- fenseman in 1941 and 1942. Higgin- botham is memorialized by a lacrosse trophy for sportsmanship, play, and in\u00ad fluence; Campbell, by a playing field for lacrosse. Princeton excelled in the 1950s and 60s. The 1951 team tied with Army for the national championship; the 1953 team won sole possession of the title. After the formal organization of the Ivy League, Princeton was champion seven consecutive years, 1957 through 1963, and then shared the championship with Harvard in 1964 and with Dartmouth in 1965. Cornell toppled Princeton in 1966, but Princeton regained first place the next year with a perfect 6-0 Ivy League record. Princeton lacrossemen named to All-American teams been: Woodward '37, Lawrence P. Naylor III '41, Joseph D. B. King '41, Tyler Campbell '43, Frederick A. AlI- ner, Jr., '46, Ernest L. Ransome III '47, Henry E. Fish '48, Leonard M. Gaines, Jr. '49, Frank J. Hoen '49, Donald P. Hahn '51, David C. Tait '53, Ralph N. Willis '53, Henry F. Baldwin '54, Douglas G. Levick III '58, John D. K. Timothy C. Callard '63, Gray G. Henry '63, John D. Baker '67. Varsity coaches have been: Albert B. Nies, 1921-1935; J. Hanna 1976-. Thomsen was named coach of the year by the U.S. Lacrosse Coaches Association in 1967. Four Princetonians have been elected to the Lacrosse Hall of Fame: Conrad J. Sutherland '24, Harland W. Meistrell '25, and Coaches William F. Logan and Ferris Thomsen. A women's lacrosse team, coached by Penelope Hinckley, was organized in 1972; high scorer for three seasons was Kienbusch Sportswoman Emily Good- fellow '76. Lafayette, Marquis de, French soldier, statesman, and liberal leader, who was a general in the American Revolu\u00ad tionary army and a close friend of George Washington, was made an hon\u00ad orary Doctor of Laws by the Trustees of the College in 1790 in recognition of his contribution to the American cause of independence. His full name, as re\u00ad corded in the official list of honorary graduates, was Marie Jean Paul Joseph Roche Yves Gilbert du Motier, Mar\u00ad quis de Lafayette. Its honorary degree having been con\u00ad ferred in absentia, the College took the occasion of a visit by Lafayette thirty- four years later to award him his di\u00ad ploma. He stopped at Princeton, on the way from New York to Washington, in September 1824, at the beginning of the triumphal American tour he made on the invitation of Congress. Soon after arrival (according to John Mac\u00ad lean, Jr., the Professor of Mathemat\u00ad ics), the Marquis, his son George Wash\u00ad ington Lafayette, and members of his escort were entertained at a \"very bountiful\" breakfast in the gaily deco\u00ad rated college refectory, \"then the largest room in town.\" Later, the Mar\u00ad quis was escorted to a circular canopy, which had been erected near the cen\u00ad tral gate of the front campus. Here, be\u00ad fore a throng of students and people from the town and neighboring coun\u00ad tryside, President Carnahan presented to Lafayette the doctor of laws diploma, which President Witherspoon had signed in 1790, in ceremonies at which 282 A LAW SCHOOL the College's Peale portrait of Washing\u00ad ton was conspicuously displayed. Law School, A, had a brief existence at Princeton in the middle of the nineteenth century. Its faculty in\u00ad cluded the former chief justice of New Jersey, Joseph C. Hornblower of Newark, and two local attorneys of high standing, James S. Green and Richard S. Field 1821. Its classes were held in a brownstone building on Mercer Street, which Field had built at his own ex\u00ad pense for this purpose. The school was formally opened at the Colleges cen\u00ad tennial celebration in 1847, with an ex\u00ad tended discourse by Chief Justice (later Chancellor) Henry Woodhull Green 1820 on the need for a well-educated bar. Despite its auspicious beginnings, the Law School failed to become viable. Lacking any special endowment, the College depended solely upon tuition fees for its expenses, and enrollment was insufficient to provide adequate salaries for the lecturers. Only seven men qualified for the degree of bachelor of laws\u2014four in 1849, two in 1850, one in 1852. The announcement of the school was dropped from the cat\u00ad alogue in 1852 and the names of the three professors in 1854. Later the law school building was given the name, Ivy Hall, and used for other purposes; it was eventually acquired by its neigh\u00ad bor, Trinity Episcopal Church. The venture of 1847 represented the trustees' third attempt to found a law school. In the 1820s they had begun preparations for courses of lectures in law and in medicine to be given by two of their members, ex-Senator Richard Stockton 1779 and Dr. John Van Cleve 1797, a local physician; but before the plans could be matured, both men died. In 1835, on being assured by a com\u00ad mittee that they had promises of enough financial support to make an experiment \"without encroaching on the means of the Board,\" the trustees had elected ex-Governor Samuel L. Southard 1804 and two other eminent members of the bar as professors of law, but they all declined appointment. These three unsuccessful attempts notwithstanding, the desirability of having some kind of program of legal studies has been revived several times. President Patton brought the subject up in 1890. \"We have Princeton philosophy, Princeton theology, but we have to go to Harvard and Columbia for our law,\" he told an alumni gathering. \"Gentlemen, that is a shame. Just as soon as I find a man with half a million, I am going to found a law school.\" Nothing came of this pronounce\u00ad ment, however, much to the disap\u00ad pointment of the professor of juris\u00ad prudence\u2014Woodrow Wilson. Shortly after his election as president in 1902, Wilson, in a report to the trustees, pro\u00ad posed a school of jurisprudence in which law would be taught \"only to university graduates and by men who could give it full scholarly scope and meaning without rendering it merely theoretical or in any sense unpracti\u00ad cal,\u2014men who could, rather, render it more luminously practical by making it a thing built upon principle, not a thing constructed by rote out of miscellane\u00ad ous precedents.\" But in his order of priorities, new funds for faculty salaries, preceptorships, the library, a recitation hall, science laboratories, and a graduate school of arts and sci\u00ad ences took precedence, and when Wil\u00ad son resigned in 1910, the school of jurisprudence had not been realized. Two developments in the seventies gave new emphasis to Princeton's con-HENRY LEE 283 tinuing interest in legal education. The first was the initiation in 1973 of a four-year joint Master of Public Affairs-Doctor of Jurisprudence pro\u00ad gram by the Woodrow Wilson School in collaboration with Columbia and New York University law schools. The sec\u00ad ond was President Bowen's appoint\u00ad ment in 1974 of a committee to explore the factors which might enter into a University decision on a program in law. Following a year-long study, this committee, which was composed of Woodrow Wilson School Dean Donald E. Stokes '51, chairman, New York lawyer Robert Owen '52, and Politics Professor Dennis F. Thompson, sub\u00ad mitted an extensive report to President Bowen. While concluding that a law program with qualities adapted both to Princeton's special characteristics and the special needs of legal education \"could bring new strength to Princeton and could make a genuine contribution to the nation,\" the committee em\u00ad phasized that very substantial gifts would be needed to endow such a pro\u00ad gram and to meet its initial plant and li\u00ad brary costs. President Bowen and the trustees' executive committee accepted the Stokes committee's recommenda\u00ad tion that in view constraints\" facing Princeton, ac\u00ad tive consideration of a law program be postponed, but they suggested that the committee's \"thoughtful and creative\" report deserved wider distribution, and a summary was accordingly published in the Alumni Weekly. Lee, Henry (1756-1818) American Revolutionary cavalry officer known as \"Light-Horse Harry\" Lee and father of Robert E. Lee, graduated from Princeton in 1773. He and his younger brother Charles entered Princeton in the summer of 1770, when they were fourteen and twelve, after a ten-day journey from Virginia, by stage and on horseback, with their friend James Madison 1771. The Lee brothers roomed together in Nassau Hall. Charles, who graduated two years after Henry, later became at\u00ad torney genera] of the United States. Henry was a good student, won prizes in classics, and read widely in English poetry. He spent one vacation making a line-by-line comparison of Pope's trans\u00ad lation of the Iliad with Homer's origi\u00ad nal. He joined the Cliosophic Society but later transferred to its rival, Whig, of which Madison was a founder. Lee came into prominence in 1779 when, as a twenty-three-year-old major, he led a daring capture of the British fort at Paulus Hook (now in Jer\u00ad sey, City), New Jersey. Washington had previously invited him to become his aide but Lee had declined, preferring the more exciting opportunity of adven\u00ad ture in the field. He later served bril\u00ad liantly as cavalry commander in the southern campaign under General Nathanael Greene. After the war Lee was elected gover\u00ad nor of Virginia and, later, a member of Congress. A close friend of George Washington all his adult life, Lee was the author of the historic tribute, \"first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.\" He used these words in the resolutions adopted by Congress on the death of Washing\u00ad ton and again in a eulogy he delivered at the state funeral service held for the first president in Philadelphia. Lee had been at his best as a dashing cavalry officer in the Revolution\u2014\"a Rupert in battle,\" Woodrow Wilson called him, \"a boy in counsel, high- strung, audacious, wilful, lovable, a figure for romance.\" He was less well fitted for civil and domestic life, and his 284 SOLOMON LEFSCHETZ later years were marred by financial re\u00ad verses and long periods away from home. He lost heavily in land specula\u00ad tions and spent a year in debtor's prison when Robert E. Lee (his fifth child by his second wife) was only two. While in prison he wrote his memoirs of the Revolution. In 1812, in Baltimore, he was seriously injured while in the com\u00ad pany of a group opposed to \"Mr. Madi\u00ad son's War,\" who were under attack by an angry mob. Madison denounced the rioters as barbarians and offered Lee a commission as major-general in the army, but he was too weak to accept. Ill and impoverished, he spent his last years in the West Indies in a vain effort to regain his health. After the Civil War, Robert E. Lee brought out a new edition of his father's memoirs, with a biographical sketch in which he showed a high regard for his military exploits. Lefschetz, Solomon (1884-1972) came to the United States in 1907 as an en\u00ad gineer, but turned to mathematics when he lost both hands in an accident while working for the Westinghouse Company. He eventually became world renowned for his contributions to the topological study of all algebraic geometry and the algebraic study of to\u00ad pology. At Princeton, as Fine Professor and department chairman, he carried on where Fine, Eisenhart, and Veblen (qq.v.) left off in making Fine Hall world-famous as a center for mathe\u00ad matics. He was born in Moscow and grew up in Paris, where he graduated from the Ecole Centrale in 1905 with a degree in mechanical engineering. Following the accident, in 1910 he won a fellowship in mathematics at Clark University and gained his Ph.D. there after only one year. He came to Princeton in 1924 from the University of Kansas, was named Fine Professor in 1933 and ap\u00ad pointed department chairman in 1945; he continued in both offices until his re\u00ad tirement in 1953. Lefschetz was brought to Princeton by Dean Fine as part of a continuing ef\u00ad fort to develop a first-rate mathematics department. After the newly founded Institute for Advanced Study took James W. Alexander II, Oswald Veb\u00ad len, and John von Neumann from the University in the early 1930s, Lefschetz supplied the creative drive that main\u00ad tained the department's research strength and the energy and imagina\u00ad tion that led it to new heights. As chairman, the University Orator later said in presenting him for an honorary degree, he ruled \"with some pepper, much salt, and an invigorating and impetuous impishness.\" Under Lef- schetz's dynamic guidance the Annals of Mathematics which he edited for twenty-five years, became one of the world's foremost mathematical journals. In his early research in algebraic geometry Lefschetz made innovative use of topological methods, winning the Bordin Prize of the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1919 and the Bocher Prize of the American Mathematical Society in 1924. In the twenties he began to concentrate on topology itself, proving his famous \"fixed point formula\" and the \"Lefschetz duality theorem.\" \"To\u00ad pology\" is a word he coined in 1930 as the title for a monograph that brought this subject to the forefront of pure mathematics. During the Second World War, he turned his attention to more applied mathematics\u2014nonlinear differential equations, stability theory, and control theory\u2014in which he con\u00ad tinued to work the rest of his life. He wrote over 100 papers, as well as a number of books and monographs. THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY 285 On his retirement from the Univer\u00ad sity in 1953, he embarked on a period of strenuous activity that lasted almost a score of years. He helped organize at Martin Company's Research Institute for Advanced Study in Baltimore a Mathematics Center which, when it moved to Brown University, became known as the Center for Dynamical Systems. His efforts to make known re\u00ad cent Soviet advances in mathematics and his leadership in developing an American school in nonlinear differen\u00ad tial equations and kindred subjects were of strategic importance to Ameri\u00ad can space technology. At the same time, he helped build a school of pure math\u00ad ematics at the National University of Mexico, and in recognition of this achievement received Mexico's Order of the Aztec Eagle. Two international conferences in his honor were held, one on algebraic geometry and topol\u00ad ogy in Princeton in 1954 on the occa\u00ad sion of his retirement and the other on differential equations and dynamical systems in Puerto Rico in 1965. His distinction in his field brought him the presidency of the American Mathematical Society, membership in the American Philosophical Society and the National Academy of Sciences, and foreign membership in the Royal Soci\u00ad ety of London and the Academies of Sciences in Madrid, Milan, and Paris. He received honorary degrees from Mexico, Paris, and Prague, as well as from Brown, Clark, and Princeton. In 1956 he received the Feltrinelli Prize of the Academia dei Lincei. In 1965, when he was eighty-one, he was awarded the National Medal of Science \"for indomitable leadership in develop\u00ad ing mathematics and training mathe\u00ad maticians.\" And his colleagues in Fine Hall, on his death in 1972 at age eighty-eight, added to the many honors he had received in his long career a final tribute which only they could make, when they cited as qualities they would always remember, his love of life, his courage, vigor, and humor, his incessant curiosity, and his \"towering genius.\" Library, The University. Book collec\u00ad tions were among the first concerns of the founders and benefactors of Princeton and of other American colo\u00ad nial colleges. Two years after its found\u00ad ing, Harvard received by bequest the library of the man for whom the college was named, while Yale traditionally traces its beginning to a donation of books by ten Connecticut clergymen. Just before it acquired its permanent home in Princeton, the College of New Jersey was presented with 474 volumes from the library of Jonathan Belcher, royal governor of the province. Gifts of books came in from other friends of the College, and in 1760 a catalogue of the library, compiled and published by President Samuel Davies, listed 1,281 volumes. This catalogue was in part a fund-raising venture; Pres\u00ad ident Davies indicated in the preface that it was published to provide infor\u00ad mation for those \"watching for Oppor\u00ad tunities of doing Good,\" and to afford \"particular Benefactors the Pleasure of seeing how many others have concurred with them in their favorite charity.\" President Davies also described the Library's purpose\u2014in eloquent terms that have continued to have meaning for more than two centuries: A large and well-sorted Collection of Books on the various Branches of Literature is the most proper and valuable Fund with which [the Col\u00ad lege] can be endowed. It is one of the best Helps to enrich the Minds both 286 THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY of the Officers and Students with Knowledge; to give them an exten\u00ad sive Acquaintance with Authors; and to lead them beyond the narrow Limits of the Books to which they are confined in their stated Studies and Recitations, that they may expatiate at large thro' the boundless and var\u00ad iegated Fields of Science [i.e., knowl\u00ad edge]. THE LIBRARY'S MANY HOMES Over the years the Library has oc\u00ad cupied a variety of physical accommo\u00ad dations. When the College moved from Newark to Princeton in 1756, two large boxQS of books were sent by water from Newark to New Brunswick and con\u00ad veyed to a room on the second floor of newly constructed Nassau Hall, which became the College's first library. This historic room suffered the depredation of military occupation in the Revolu\u00ad tion, served as the meeting place of the Continental Congress in the summer and fall of 1783, and was almost totally destroyed by the disastrous fire of 1802. Soon after this fire, the Library was reestablished in Stanhope Hall (com\u00ad pleted in 1803), its collections now con\u00ad siderably enlarged through generous contributions to replace the losses. The Library remained in Stanhope Hall until 1860, when it was returned to Nassau Hall, this time to larger quar\u00ad ters in the rear wing (now the Faculty Room), created as a part of the build\u00ad ing's restoration following another fire in 1855. Under the dynamic leadership of President McCosh, the College ac\u00ad quired in 1873 its first separate library building, the Chancellor Green Li\u00ad brary, donated by John C. Green. This octagonal structure, in most respects admirably functional for a small library, was soon outgrown, and Pyne Library was constructed in 1897, the Sesqui-centennial gift of Mrs. Percy Rivington Pyne, mother of M. Taylor Pyne 1877 (q.v.). When Pyne Library opened, with collections numbering less than 200,000 volumes, the need for more space seemed far away. But, by the 1920s it in turn began to be desperately crowded, and plan after plan was de\u00ad veloped to relieve the situation. Dec\u00ad ades of planning eventually culminated in the Harvey S. Firestone Memorial Library, financed by gifts from 1,250 groups and individuals, the largest single gift coming at a critical time from the Firestone family. In the final stages of planning in 1944, Julian P. Boyd, the Librarian, called together representatives of a dozen other uni\u00ad versities that were also planning to con\u00ad struct large library buildings as soon as materials became available after the war. This meeting led to the creation of the Cooperative Committee on Library Buildings and to a revolution in college and university library architecture with world-wide influence. The large university library building erected in the first forty years of the century tended to be a magnificent structure, consisting principally of a large warehouse for books, closed to most students and connected to a cavernous, ill-lighted reading room by an ineffective delivery system. The change that took place following World War II is clearly exhibited in Firestone Library, one of the earliest models of the new architectural thinking. What is important about Firestone is not its ex\u00ad terior shell, vaguely Gothic to har\u00ad monize with nearby buildings, but rather its functional interior design, which seeks to bring books and readers together, serving as a scholar's work\u00ad shop, or as a \"laboratory of the hu\u00ad manities,\" to use the language of the THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY 287 planning period. That this aim has been achieved is indicated by the fact that on a typical mid-week day in the academic year 1974-1975 some 5,000 people passed through its doors to take out books or to use the more than 2,000 study seats dispersed among the stacks and in special function rooms. Flexibil\u00ad ity, another goal, was provided for by movable partitions and by spaces de\u00ad signed to serve a variety of purposes. The building has with relative ease been adjusted to changing academic requirements; the exterior walls had by 1971 been penetrated four times for new additions. While Firestone is the largest library building on the campus and houses nearly all of the Library's administra\u00ad tive functions, the collections have ex\u00ad panded into many buildings. With nota\u00ad ble exceptions, the humanities and so\u00ad cial sciences are housed in Firestone, and science and technology, with mathematics, are located in the build\u00ad ings where teaching and research in those disciplines are conducted. These special subject collections plus two small residential area libraries and the annex library for seldom-used volumes occupy space in seventeen buildings. It is, however, essentially one library, with one budget and one administra\u00ad tion, dispersed for the convenience of users. THE BOOK COLLECTIONS From the beginning, the growth of the collections has depended heavily upon gifts. The largest of the early en\u00ad dowed funds, the Elizabeth Foundation for \"the purchase of rare and valuable books needed for the purposes of re\u00ad search and study by literary and learned men,\" was created by a gift of John C. Green in 1868. Starting in 1875 and continuing through recent years, a steady source of support has been en\u00ad dowed funds for the purchase of books established by alumni classes. Of the $1,633,000 spent for acquisitions in 1973-1974, almost half came from the income of 200 Library endowed funds, with a book value of more than $11 mil\u00ad lion, or from gifts and grants of which the principal could be spent. In addi\u00ad tion, there were gifts of books and manuscripts with an appraised value of $436,475. Gifts of rare books and manuscripts have been particularly important in creating those collections of unique and almost irreplaceable materials which are the special distinction of a great re\u00ad search library. The first major collec\u00ad tion on a single subject was the Civil War collection of John S. Pierson of the Class of 1840, which grew to more than 5,000 volumes between 1873 and the donor's death in 1908. Other important gifts followed in the next decades, but not until the 1930s did the frequency of the gifts and the cumulative effect begin to produce a rich and varied col\u00ad lection of rare books and manuscripts. The gifts of Robert Garrett laid the foundation of one of the five best collec\u00ad tions of medieval and renaissance manuscripts in the country and the largest collection of Arabic manuscripts. The Gest Oriental Library contains the finest collection of Chinese rare books outside the Orient. English literature is strong, with the latter half of the nineteenth century particularly rich because of the Morris L. Parrish Col\u00ad lection of Victorian Novelists, Collec\u00ad tion, the O'Connell Cruikshank Col\u00ad lection, and the Gallatin Beardsley Collection. Primary sources of history range from the splendid early Amer\u00ad icana of Grenville Kane and Cyrus H. 288 THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY McCormick to the personal papers of public figures such as John Foster Dulles, James Forrestal, Adlai Steven\u00ad son, Bernard Baruch, and John Mar\u00ad shall Harlan. The Friends of the Princeton Li\u00ad brary, founded in 1930, and the Princeton University Library Chroni\u00ad cle, published by the Friends since 1939, have helped to establish com\u00ad munication with and among collectors and to make known to the scholarly world the resources of the Library. It is impossible in a brief acticle to do justice to the collections as they exist today, but one should note that they are substantially richer in most fields represented in the teaching and re\u00ad search program of the University than the relative size of the Library would suggest. In perhaps a dozen fields Princeton's is one of the half-dozen best libraries in the country, and in another dozen fields it is very good indeed. This satisfying state is the product of gener\u00ad ous donations of books and funds and the patient work of dozens of faculty and staff bibliographers and cata\u00ad loguers. THE LIBRARIANS For more than a hundred years those who served as Librarian, including, from 1812 to 1873, Philip Lindsly, John Maclean, Jr., George Musgrave Giger, and Henry Clay Cameron, almost al\u00ad ways had other responsibilities as vice president, clerk of the faculty, or \"overseer of college repairs,\" as well as professor or tutor. However, their duties in the Library were light, since it was generally open only an hour or two a week for the circulation of books until President McCosh arrived in 1868 and extended the period to an hour on each of five days a week. The hours con\u00ad tinued to be increased through the ad\u00administration of Frederic Vinton, brought from the Library of Congress in 1873 by President McCosh as the first full-time librarian. When Ernest Cushing Richardson took office in 1890, he opened the building for study and the circulation of books from 8:00 in the morning until dusk. (The closing hour was extended to 10 p.m. in 1898, to midnight in 1928.) The Library's various manuscript catalogues were simple lists without any subject arrangements until Cam\u00ad eron in the late 1860s rearranged the books on the shelves by subject, and his successor, Vinton, introduced an au\u00ad thor and subject card cataloguing sys\u00ad tem. The collection was completely re- catalogued by Richardson, using his own classification, which is still in use at Princeton in those areas that have not been changed to the Library of Congress classification. As consultant and adviser Richardson was active in developing the concepts and systems that have made the Li\u00ad brary of Congress the center of the na\u00ad tion's bibliographic control procedures, as he was in many other innovative as\u00ad pects of librarianship. His successors have all been actively involved in na\u00ad tional library affairs. James Thayer Gerould, Librarian from 1920 to 1940, was one of the three founders of the As\u00ad sociation of Research Libraries. Julian P. Boyd, whose Firestone Library was a remarkable achievement, was a leader in a generation of librarians who de\u00ad veloped plans and procedures to strengthen the nation's collections by sharing resources. When Boyd re\u00ad signed to devote full time to the editing of the monumental Papers of Thomas Jefferson, William S. Dix became Li\u00ad brarian after a brief period in which Maurice Kelley of the Department of English was Acting Librarian. Dix, who ABRAHAM LINCOLN 289 served from 1953 to 1975, was chair\u00ad man of the Association of Research Li\u00ad braries and president of the American Library Association. Richard W. Boss, appointed Librar\u00ad ian in 1975, was succeeded in 1978 by Donald W. Koepp. THE LIBRARY TODAY The Princeton University Library has followed and supported the growth of Princeton from a college to a univer\u00ad sity, and has become the vital center of its intellectual life. The development of the preceptorial method, junior inde\u00ad pendent work, and the senior thesis have made the Library more and more important to the academic work of un\u00ad dergraduates. At no other university is there so high a ratio of books circulated per student, even though the open stacks and the generous provision of study areas make it possible for stu\u00ad dents to use more books without bor\u00ad rowing them than in most libraries in the world. At the same time the Li\u00ad brary has gradually become a major re\u00ad search library as the number of faculty members and graduate students en\u00ad gaged in an ever-broader variety of studies has grown. To fulfill this demanding role, it has been essential that the Library's staff, collections, physical facilities, and budget keep pace with the growth of the University's programs and the vol\u00ad ume of worldwide publishing. By 1975, the staff, which had numbered eight in 1900, had grown to about 300. The col\u00ad lections totaled some 3.5 million printed books and microform equiva\u00ad lents; expenditures were more than $4.5 million. In 1973-1974 the Library added to its collections more than one and a half times as many volumes and microform equivalents as were in the total collection at the beginning of the century. Yet the multiplication of recorded knowledge and the needs of users are so great that the Library seems little more adequate for today's University than the Library of 1900 was in its day. As Julian Boyd pointed out in 1940: \"The fallacy of an impossible complete\u00ad ness in any one library should be aban\u00ad doned in theory and in practice; librar\u00ad ians should now think in terms of com\u00ad pleteness for the library resources of the whole country.\" The exponential rates of growth of all university libraries cannot go on forever. The Princeton University Li\u00ad brary continues to search for ways to increase its service to its community of students and scholars at the same time that in collaboration with its peers in this country and abroad it seeks ways of sharing resources more effectively. William S. Dix Lincoln, Abraham, accepted the hon\u00ad orary degree of Doctor of Laws from Princeton in 1864 shortly after his reelection to a second term. The de\u00ad gree was conferred at a meeting of the trustees on December 20th of that year, and President Maclean wrote to Lincoln the same day to inform him of their action. The reply, in Lincoln's own handwriting, is one of the Univer\u00ad sity's treasured possessions\u2014\"among the title deeds to our Americanism,\" as Dean Gauss once put it. The letter is as follows: Executive Mansion Washington, December 27, 1864. My Dear Sir: I have the honour to acknowledge the reception of your note of the 20th of December, conveying the an\u00ad nouncement that the Trustees of the 290 LINGUISTICS College of New Jersey have con\u00ad ferred upon me the Degree of Doc\u00ad tor of Laws. The assurance conveyed by this high compliment, that the course of the government which I represent has received the approval of a body of gentlemen of such character and in\u00ad telligence in this time of public trial, is most grateful to me. Thoughtful men must feel that the fate of civilization upon this conti\u00ad nent is involved in the issue of our contest. Among the most gratifying proofs of this conviction is the hearty devotion everywhere exhibited by our schools and colleges to the na\u00ad tional cause. I am most thankful if my labors have seemed to conduce to the pres\u00ad ervation of those institutions under which alone we can expect good gov\u00ad ernment and in its train sound learn\u00ad ing and the progress of the liberal arts. I am, sir, very truly Your obedient servant A. LINCOLN Dr. John Maclean. Linguistics. The graduate Program in Linguistics, established in 1962, was built on a tradition that goes back to the first half of this century, when Harold H. Bender (q.v.) taught Indo-European philology, and Robert K. Root (q.v.) taught the Elements of the English Language (better known as \"Root's roots\"). This tradition was later carried on by Giuliano Bonfante for Italian, Raymond S. Willis for Spanish, and Samuel D. Atkins for Indo-European, among others. In the years following World War II, Princeton first responded to the grow\u00ading interest in this field by inviting dis\u00ad tinguished linguists to be visiting pro\u00ad fessors, and by appointing younger scholars with linguistic training to the language and literature departments. Then, in 1960, William G. Moulton was called from Cornell to organize a graduate program in linguistics, spon\u00ad sored by the Council of the Humani\u00ad ties. An interdepartmental committee was established, and the program which it proposed was approved in 1961 and first offered in 1962. From the start, the Program in Lin\u00ad guistics was truly interdepartmental. Its students took modest numbers of courses in general linguistics, supple\u00ad mented by the offerings of the nine co\u00ad operating departments: anthropology, classics, East Asian studies, English, Germanic languages, philosophy, psy\u00ad chology, Romance languages, and Slavic languages. Graduates of the pro\u00ad gram went on to assume positions in language departments or departments of linguistics. Though the number of faculty mem\u00ad bers interested in linguistics was mod\u00ad est at the start, it expanded significant\u00ad ly during the 1960s. Special mention should be made of Albert H. Marck- wardt, who came from Michigan in 1963 as Professor of English and Lin\u00ad guistics, and who played a leading role in the program until his retirement in 1972. Thanks in part to Marckwardt's influ\u00ad ence, by the 1970s there was a marked increase in both graduate and undergraduate interest in linguistics. The number of undergraduates choos\u00ad ing \"independent concentration\" in linguistics was often as large as the number of regular \"majors\" in some small departments. In order to strengthen the offerings in linguistics, two visiting professors were invited to LOG COLLEGE 291 Princeton in 1973-1974, and plans were made for a Department of Linguistics with a regular undergraduate major. These plans were frustrated by the economic difficulties that beset all American universities during the mid 1970s, though they remain a hope for the future\u2014a \"high priority\" once finances are available. In the mean\u00ad time, Princeton has since 1974 had its first faculty appointments strictly in linguistics (rather than in one of the regular departments): two successive junior faculty members with specializa\u00ad tion in syntax. Though most members of the Inter\u00ad departmental Committee on Linguis\u00ad tics are known primarily for their work in related fields, two members have re\u00ad ceived national and international rec\u00ad ognition directly within the field of lin\u00ad guistics. Marckwardt was president of the Linguistic Society of America in 1962, and of the American Dialect So\u00ad ciety in 1962-1964. He was also presi\u00ad dent of the mammoth National Council of Teachers of English in 1967. In that same year, Moulton was president of the Linguistic Society of America; and, during 1972-1977, he was president of the international organization of lin\u00ad guists: the Comite International Per\u00ad manent des Linguistes. Princeton, through its linguists, continues to serve the nation\u2014and the world. William G. Moulton Little, Stafford, Hall, which Scott Fitzgerald likened to a snake winding its way from Blair Hall to the Gym\u00ad nasium, was built half in 1899, half in 1901. It was Princeton's second col\u00ad legiate Gothic building and was de\u00ad signed, as was the first\u2014Blair Hall\u2014by the Philadelphia firm of Cope and Stewardson. Little had the honor also of being the first dormitory built with bathrooms. The donor, Stafford Little 1844, (who also endowed the Stafford Little Lec\u00ad tureship) was a founder and first presi\u00ad dent of the New York and Long Branch Railroad, and for several years presi\u00ad dent of the New Jersey Senate. He was a trustee of Princeton from 1901 to 1904. Log College was the name given to a school that William Tennent, an Irish-born, Edinburgh-educated Pres\u00ad byterian minister, conducted at Neshaminy, Bucks County, Pennsylva\u00ad nia from 1726 until his death in 1745. Here, in a \"log house, about twenty feet long and near as many broad,\" Tennent drilled his pupils in the an\u00ad cient languages and the Bible and filled them with an evangelical zeal that a number of them, his four sons in\u00ad cluded, manifested conspicuously dur\u00ad ing the religious revivals known as The Great Awakening. The name \"Log College\" was at first applied derisively by Old Side Presby\u00ad terians who disliked some of the excita\u00ad ble and intrusive methods of its New Side graduates and disdained the nar\u00ad rowness of their training. But in time it took on a prouder connotation as its graduates filled vacancies in the grow\u00ad ing number of Presbyterian congrega\u00ad tions in the Middle Colonies and in the South and founded schools on the fron\u00ad tier modeled on their Alma Mater. THE PRINCETON CONNECTION Some writers have assumed that the College of New Jersey grew directly out of the Log College, that indeed it could be regarded as a continuation of it, but, as President Maclean and Pro\u00ad fessor Wertenbaker have shown, this 292 LOURIE-LOVE HALL assumption is not supported by the facts. The Log College adherents, Profes\u00ad sor Wertenbaker pointed out, were not among the seven original incorporators of the College of New Jersey on Octo\u00ad ber 22, 1746. Moreover, it was the educational ideas of these seven men, all graduates of Yale or Harvard, that were embodied in the charter they ob\u00ad tained, establishing a college for the education of youth in the liberal arts and sciences\u2014not those of the adher\u00ad ents of the Log College where per\u00ad sonal piety and religious experience were emphasized, and as President Maclean said, \"the great benefits of mental discipline . . . and of polite learning were not estimated at their full value.\" However, soon after the College of New Jersey was founded, a number of Log College men rallied to its support and joined with their New Side breth- ern from Yale and Harvard in rendering it conspicuous service. Six months after the granting of the charter, three Log College graduates\u2014Samuel Blair, Gil\u00ad bert Tennent, and William Tennent, Jr.\u2014and Samuel Finley, who was prob\u00ad ably also an alumnus, and Richard Treat, who was one of its adherents, ac\u00ad cepted election as Princeton trustees. Finley later became fifth president. Samuel Davies, who preceded Finley as president, studied with Samuel Blair and thus fell heir to the influence of the Log College. It was, moreover, Davies and Gilbert Tennent who, sent to Great Britain by the trustees in 1753, raised there the funds to build Nassau Hall. Thus, while the facts do not warrant Princeton's pushing its founding date back to 1726, as has sometimes been proposed, they do show that an histori\u00ad cal debt ofgratitude is due some of Wil\u00ad liam Tennent, Sr.'s pupils and some of their pupils for the substantial help\u2014 both spiritual and practical\u2014they gave the College of New Jersey during its formative years. Lourie-Love Hall, a south campus dormitory accommodating seventy- eight students, is a monument to the long, close friendship of Donold Brad\u00ad ford Lourie '22 and George Hutchinson Love '22. They were roommates at Exeter and again at Princeton, where Love was manager of the football team and Lourie an All-American quarter\u00ad back, and both were members of the Senior Council. At the Cannon Exer\u00ad cises of 1922 they were handcuffed to\u00ad gether; these handcuffs were put in the corner-stone of Lourie-Love Hall. After graduation they went back home, Lourie to Chicago, where he eventually became chairman of the board of the Quaker Oats Company, Love to Pittsburgh, where he became chairman of the board of the Consolidation Coal Company and then of the Chrysler Corporation. They remained close friends and, on their not infrequent vis\u00ad its to Princeton, almost inseparable companions. Lourie was elected an alumni trustee in 1934, a charter trus\u00ad tee in 1948; Love an alumni trustee in 1954, a charter trustee in 1961. To\u00ad gether they gave the dormitory in 1964. Lowrie, Walter, House at 83 Stockton Street was given to the University in 1960 by Barbara Armour Lowrie in memory of her husband, Walter Low\u00ad rie 1890. It was used as a University guest house until 1968, when it became the residence of the president. The house was designed by the Philadelphia architect John Notman (architect also of Prospect and of the 1855 restoration of Nassau Hall) and was built in 1845 by Commodore DAVID ALOYSIOUS McCABE 293 Robert F. Stockton U.S.N, for his son, John P. Stockton, Princeton 1843, at\u00ad torney general of New Jersey and United States senator. It was later oc\u00ad cupied by Paul Tulane, Princeton-born founder and benefactor of the univer\u00ad sity that bears his name. In 1895 the house was acquired by George Allison Armour 1877, and became the child\u00ad hood home of Barbara Armour and her four brothers. Barbara and Walter Lowrie took up residence there in 1930, following their return from Rome, where he had been for many years rector of the Episcopal congrega\u00ad tion at St. Paul's-within-the-Walls. At the age of sixty-two, Lowrie began teaching himself Danish, and for the next twenty-seven years he devoted himself to the translation of all the works of the Danish philosopher, S0ren Kierkegaard, and to the writing of a biography one authority called \"the greatest one-volume work on Kier\u00ad kegaard in any language.\" Lowrie wrote other books too, including one on Karl Barth; in the period of his so-called retirement he published twenty-seven volumes in as many years. Lowrie was secretary of his class for the last five years of his life and, in Alumni Weekly class notes, regaled his dwindling band of octogenarian class\u00ad mates with reminiscences of their col\u00ad lege days and pungent allusions to their declining years. Once he began his col\u00ad umn: \"I greet each of my classmates with the cheerful salutation: 'Moriturus te saluto! [I who am about to die salute you!].' \" Another time he misconstrued a notice of the change of address of a classmate as a notice of his death and so reported it in the Weekly. Several weeks later he announced in the class notes that the classmate \"was miracu\u00ad lously raised from the dead by reading my obituary of him . . . and promises to send his contribution to the Alumni Fund.\" \"I cannot now be sorry,\" Low\u00ad rie concluded, \"that I published an ac\u00ad count of his demise, though it was grossly exaggerated, seeing that it had so salutary an effect.\" McCabe, David Aloysious (1883-1974), first Joseph D. Green 1895 Professor of Economics, laid the groundwork for the development of Princeton's distin\u00ad guished tradition in labor economics. One of the last preceptors appointed by Woodrow Wilson, McCabe was discov\u00ad ered by Winthrop M. Daniels, chair\u00ad man of the Department of History, Politics, and Economics, who lectured at Johns Hopkins in 1909, the year McCabe took his Ph.D. there under George Barnett, the American pioneer in the study of labor relations. For forty-three years thereafter McCabe was one of the University's most popular teachers and a valued counselor in fac\u00ad ulty affairs; he was for a time chairman of the economics department. His four books dealt with labor rela\u00ad tions: the first, the standard wage rate in American trade unions; the second (written with his old Hopkins teacher, Barnett), the handling of industrial dis\u00ad putes; the third, collective bargaining in the pottery industry; and the fourth (written with his younger colleague, Richard A. Lester, later a successor as Green Professor), labor and social reor\u00ad ganization. He was a member of various commis\u00ad sions for the prevention and settlement of labor disputes, serving notably as chairman of the Regional Labor Board for New Jersey in the 1930s and as ar\u00ad bitrator for the National War Labor Board during the Second World War. His warm personality made him a good negotiator, and he enjoyed his relations with workers and employers. Return-294 McCARTER THEATRE ing once from arbitrating a wage dis\u00ad pute, he quoted with relish a labor rep\u00ad resentative who had interrupted an analysis McCabe was presenting with the injunction: \"Never mind the statis\u00ad tics, professor, just give us the facts.\" Witty, blunt, and demanding, he was a provocative teacher. His lectures were models of clarity and his precep- torials so challenging that places in his sections were always eagerly sought. For many years before his marriage he lived in a campus dormitory (Patton Hall) and was interested in all phases of student life; with Dean Hugh S. Taylor, he helped establish the Catholic chap\u00ad laincy in 1928. His short stature was a source of good-natured ribbing by un\u00ad dergraduates, who called him \"Shorty\": \"How about this man, McCabe,\" the seniors sang, \"Who ceased to grow while still a babe?\" McCabe's forensic skill\u2014he had been a prize debater at Harvard\u2014and his bubbling Irish wit made him a vig\u00ad orous and respected elder statesman in faculty meetings. He was said to have spent much time and ingenuity getting off committees to which his admiring colleagues insisted on appointing him. Once at a tea party the president's wife lavished praise on McCabe as one whose counsel her husband counted on in all faculty matters. \"Ah, Mrs. Hib- ben,\" Shorty rejoined, \"I too have kissed the blarney stone.\" When he died, at the age of 90, the faculty memorialized him as \"a stalwart exponent of its best traditions in teach\u00ad ing, scholarship, and public service.\" McCarter Theatre. Of the Princeton Triangle Club's many contributions to the cultural life of Princeton University and its surrounding region, none is more imposing than the McCarter Theatre, which stands massive and towered on its 2.7-acre plot\u2014much of it in sweeping lawn\u2014at what was once a main approach to the campus: across University Place from the old Pennsyl\u00ad vania \"Dinky'station. What the existence of this 1,000-seat theater has meant to both University and region is immeasurable, for it has been host through the years to an in\u00ad credible number and variety of impor\u00ad tant dramatic, musical, dance, film, and other events. Construction of such a theater was probably inevitable when Princeton students formed an organization (named in 1893 \"the Triangle Club\" [q.v.]) to begin a tradition of under\u00ad graduate musical extravaganzas des\u00ad tined to become nationally famous. After a 1924 fire leveled the rickety 1890 campus \"Casino,\" a serious fund- raising effort began for a new theater. In June 1927, between acts of Tri\u00ad angle's Samarkand, Professor Donald Clive Stuart, considered by many the father of performed drama at Prince\u00ad ton, came on stage and introduced Thomas N. McCarter '88 and accepted his check for $250,000 toward a new theater for Triangle and other uses. Under the devoted stewardship of Benjamin Franklin Bunn 07 (q.v.), Triangle had accumulated a substantial hoard of its own, so that, by June 1928, Mr. McCarter's contribution, plus Triangle's box office kitty, and other gifts, totaled $450,000, and construc\u00ad tion could begin. On February 21, 1930, the McCarter Theatre\u2014designed by architect D. K. Este Fisher, Jr. '13, and built of native shale relieved by red brick on lines de\u00ad scribed as Georgian with Gothic accents\u2014opened its doors to its first audience, for Triangle's The Golden Dog. The next night it was formally dedicated. McCARTER THEATRE 295 Now the Club had a rock-solid house made to order for its annual large-cast shows and the makings of an equally impressive financial headache; for the McCarter, conceived in boom, was born in depression, and into a world in which talking pictures and radio were beginning to give painful competition to \"live\" performances of all kinds, even before the coming of television. For some years the McCarter was a popular house for pre-Broadway try- outs of new plays and post-Broadway tours of new plays and post-Broadway tours of established hits. Among its world premieres were Our Town by Thornton Wilder, A.M. '26; Bus Stop by William Inge; The Wisteria Trees, adapted from Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard by a Triangle stalwart Joshua Logan '31; Separate Tables by Terence Rattigan. It is hard to name an American stage star of the 1930s and 1940s who did not play McCarter: John Barrymore, Ethel Barrymore, George M. Cohan, Helen Hayes, Katharine Hepburn, Paul Robeson, Cornelia Otis Skinner\u2014the list goes on and on. But after World War II, not only did the number of touring Broadway hits decline but New York producers began to cut costs by substituting in-town previews for out-of-town tryouts of new works. McCarter's income from these sources shrank, and Triangle's earnings from its own shows had already shrunk, with the result that the Club was going steadily into debt to the University for the high costs of theatrical landlordism: insurance, utilities, repairs, and the like. In 1950, with the debt at $47,000 and obviously increasing, Triangle and the University made a deal: the University would cancel the debt\u2014\"in recognition of Triangle's services to the University and significant contributions to McCar\u00ad ter Theatre\"\u2014and would take over the theater, giving Triangle use of it for re\u00ad hearsals and productions, and maintain\u00ad ing the club's office and workroom. The loss of booked-in plays left a vac\u00ad uum at McCarter that Princeton's pres\u00ad ident Robert F. Goheen sought to fill in the late 1950s with a program of plays produced under University auspices. The aim was to give an undergraduate, in four years, a taste of world drama \"from Greek to modern, Oriental plays to musicals\" with obvious entertain\u00ad ment and cultural benefits to the re\u00ad gion. That program has continued to this writing, with changes in emphasis and in management: artistic directors have included Milton Lyon, Ellis Raab (for 1960 when his APA Company was in residence), Arthur Lithgow, Louis Criss, and Michael Kahn. Costs for the theater program, and for theater maintenance in general, have risen sharply, and the University, while continuing to subsidize it, has in\u00ad creasingly taken the line that the com\u00ad munity that shares McCarter's benefits should assume more financial responsi\u00ad bility for its operation. The community has shown an impressive willingness to do this, but the surrounding region is relatively sparsely populated for the maintenance of so large a theater. Meanwhile, McCarter during the cooler months\u2014lacking air-condition\u00ad ing, it is \"dark\" in the summer\u2014is one of the busiest theaters in America, of\u00ad fering, in addition to its own drama program, a feast of other experiences for students and the general public. With an illustrious past and present, it has, like most cultural institutions, a promising and precarious future. William McCleery 296 JOHN MACLEAN, SR. Maclean, John, Sr. (1771-1814) was Princeton's first professor of chemistry. Benjamin Rush (q.v.) and others had previously taught chemistry in medical schools, but Maclean's lectures at Princeton constituted the first Ameri\u00ad can undergraduate course in chemistry. A precocious Scot, Maclean entered the University of Glasgow in his native city at the age of thirteen, determined to become a surgeon like his father. Under the influence of his friend Charles Macintosh (who later invented waterproof cloth) he joined the Chemi\u00ad cal Society, before which he read sev\u00ad eral papers. After completing his pre\u00ad liminary studies in arts and medicine, he did further work in Edinburgh, London, and Paris; and in 1791, when he was only twenty, Maclean was licensed to practice and was admitted to the faculty of physicans and surgeons of the University of Glasgow. Attracted by American political ideals, he came to this country in the spring of 1795 and, on the advice of Benjamin Rush, established himself in Princeton in the practice of \"physic\" and surgery. That summer, on Presi\u00ad dent Stanhope Smith's invitation, he delivered a short course of chemistry lectures, which made so favorable an impression that the trustees in October appointed him Professor of Chemistry with the understanding that he would be at liberty to continue the practice of his profession. Two years later, on the death of Walter Minto (q.v.), Maclean assumed responsibility for instruction in mathematics and natural philosophy as well as in chemistry; he gave up his medical practice, and from that time on devoted himself wholly to the College. In 1797 he published Two Lectures on Combustion, which helped to over\u00ad throw Priestley's phlogiston theory and to clear the way for acceptance of Lavoisier's \"new chemistry,\" to which he had been won over during his studies in Paris. Maclean helped Benjamin Silliman, later regarded as one of the fathers of science in America, to prepare for his duties as Yale's first chemistry profes\u00ad sor, following his appointment in 1802. In his diary Silliman said he considered Maclean his \"earliest master of Chemis\u00ad try\" and Princeton his \"starting point in that pursuit.\" Maclean died at the age of forty- three in 1814\u2014two years after his res\u00ad ignation (which had been requested by a board of trustees more concerned with training ministers than scientists) and two years before the graduation of his eldest son, John Maclean, Jr., who became the tenth president of the Col\u00ad lege. Maclean, John, Jr. 1816 (1800-1886) was a member of the faculty for fifty years, serving successively as tutor, professor, vice-president, and tenth president. It was one of the longest as\u00ad sociations in Princeton's history. Son of the first professor of chemis\u00ad try, John Maclean, Sr. (q.v.), he was born in Princeton and lived there al\u00ad most all his life, either on or near the Campus. At his graduation from the College Maclean was the youngest member of his class. Two years later, after earning a divinity degree at the Princeton Theo\u00ad logical Seminary, he began his career in the College as a tutor in Greek. He was then eighteen. He became a full profes\u00ad sor at twenty-three, vice-president at twenty-nine, and president at fifty- four. AS VICE-PRESIDENT Maclean was the mainstay of the thirty-one-year administration of his JOHN MACLEAN, JR. 297 predecessor, President James Carna- han (q.v.). When Carnahan, dismayed by the state of affairs he found on his ar\u00ad rival in 1823, thought of resigning, Maclean persuaded him to remain. And when, a few years later, Carnahan thought of closing the College because a further drop in enrollment necessi\u00ad tated cuts in faculty salaries and led to a lowering of morale, Maclean came for\u00ad ward with a bold plan to stop the de\u00ad cline by enlarging and improving the faculty. The trustees accepted his plan and made him vice-president. Maclean secured a few gifts, discovered some funds due the College that had not pre\u00ad viously been collected, shifted his own field from mathematics back to classics in order to make way for an able young mathematician, and secured the half- time services of several older men as an inexpensive means of broadening the curriculum. Making the most of the College's limited means, he was able to add to the faculty such outstanding men as Joseph Henry, John Torrey, Stephen Alexander, Albert B. Dod (qq.v.), and James Alexander. These appointments reversed the trend, raising enrollment from 87 in 1829 to 228 ten years later. IN LOCO PARENTIS Maclean never married; the time and energy ordinarily expended by a father on his children he gave instead to the students of the College, for whom he quite literally stood in loco parentis. In this he was helped by his two maiden sisters, who lived with him. He was vigilant in detecting wrong\u00ad doing, but sympathetic to the culprit once he was caught. Frequently, he would intercede with the faculty to allow the offender to escape with rus\u00ad tication at a nearby farm. This was a mild enough penalty: returning from rustication, one student reported that he had spent the weeks fishing and \"thinking what a good man Doctor Maclean was.\" Sometimes, if the infrac\u00ad tion of the rules was minor, Maclean would merely administer a rebuke; and he seldom rebuked, his students said, without making a friend. His students also recalled often see\u00ad ing him in his long cloak, armed with a lamp, a teakettle and food, on his way to visit a sick student. In case of serious illness the student was brought to his house, and many a parent also found a home with him until the emergency was over. One student, who broke his leg in a fall from a second floor window of West College after the Senior Ball of 1847, was cared for at Maclean's house by Miss Mary Maclean for six weeks. Maclean was not without a sense of humor. One night two donkeys from a nearby farm were found on the top floor of Nassau Hall. A student on hand at the discovery asked Maclean, with an innocent air, how he thought they had got there. \"Through their great anxi\u00ad ety,\" Maclean replied, \"to visit some of their brethren.\" He was generous with students in financial straits: over the years he ac\u00ad cumulated a drawerful of watches and other articles, unredeemed pledges for loans he had made from his personal funds. WORK IN THE COMMUNITY Maclean showed the same concern for his fellow townsmen. He took a par\u00ad ticular interest in the welfare of Ne\u00ad groes in the community, serving as their personal counselor and benefactor and as one of the organizers and sup\u00ad porters of the Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church, a Negro congre\u00ad gation. Maclean was also the chief sup\u00ad port of the Second Presbyterian Church (now united with the First Church), 298 JOHN MACLEAN, JR. known for many years as \"Doctor Mac\u00ad lean's church.\" A member of the Prison Association, he sometimes walked the ten miles to Trenton on Sundays to conduct services in the State Prison. He was one of the earliest advocates of public education in New Jersey. An address he delivered in 1829 inspired the state legislature to initiate a system closely following his ideas. Staunch Presbyterian though he was in the af\u00ad fairs of the College, he insisted that the public schools should be completely non-sectarian: \"There should be in no case the least interference with the rights of conscience, and no scholar should be required to attend to any les\u00ad son relating to morals or religion, to which his parents may be opposed.\" PRESIDENCY Maclean's election in 1854 as Presi\u00ad dent Carnahan's successor was as much a reward for previous service as it was an expectation of future achievement. Indeed, there was a strong feeling among the trustees that the College needed a leader of greater distinction, and many favored calling Joseph Henry to the post. But Henry declined to be a candidate and urged the elec\u00ad tion of Maclean, stressing particularly his \"untiring devotion to the interest of the college.\" As it turned out, Maclean's \"untiring devotion\" was just what the College needed for the two extraordinary chal\u00ad lenges it had to face during the years he was president: the loss of Nassau Hall by fire in 1855 and the drop of enroll\u00ad ment during the Civil War. Maclean rallied alumni and friends to contribute funds toward the rebuilding of Nassau Hall, augmented these funds by operat\u00ad ing the College on an austerity budget for five years, and then helped liq\u00ad uidate the debt that remained by giving up part of his own salary. More than a third of Princeton's students came from the South, and the College suffered a corresponding drop in enrollment dur\u00ad ing the Civil War. But Maclean man\u00ad aged to keep his faculty together and to maintain a full program for the students who remained. He and the faculty came out strongly for the Union cause\u2014more strongly than some of his old student friends from the South thought necessary, but less quickly than some from the North thought appropriate\u2014and Maclean conveyed to President Lincoln (q.v.) an honorary degree voted by the trustees. During his presidency, Maclean added a number of good men to the faculty, including the Swiss geographer Arnold Guyot, but as a whole the ap\u00ad pointments during this period lacked the luster of those he had contrived ear\u00ad lier. Professor Wertenbaker concluded from his study of the Maclean papers that while Maclean sought good scholars he also looked for good Presby\u00ad terians, and that the second desid\u00ad eratum sometimes interfered with the first. LAST YEARS On his retirement in 1868, friends bought a house for Maclean at 25 Alex\u00ad ander Street, where he lived out his years with one of his brothers. In 1877 he completed a two-volume history of the College, an indispensable source of information about Princeton's early years, assigning the royalties to a fund \"for the aid of indigent and worthy students engaged in seeking a liberal education.\" Although he stayed away from the Campus during term time\u2014except when he was asked to preach in Chap\u00ad el\u2014he made brief appearances there at commencement, and whenever a knot HOWARD MCCLENAHAN 299 of alumni caught sight of him, a cheer went up for \"Johnny.\" His last appearance\u2014six weeks before he died\u2014was at the commencement meet\u00ad ing of the alumni in 1886, the 70th an\u00ad niversary of his own graduation. As honorary president of the Alumni Asso\u00ad ciation (of which he had been a princi\u00ad pal founder and the first secretary), he was given an ovation which, by con\u00ad temporary accounts, was loud, long and tearful. \"Some of us old fellows . . . who cheered first and cried afterward,\" one of them said later, \"put a meaning into our action which nobody but Doctor Maclean and ourselves knew. There were secrets between us which he was too good ever to tell, and which, perhaps, we were ashamed to. His full biography will never be written. Its materials would have to be gathered from too many hearts.\" Maclean, John, House, originally the President's House, shares with Nassau Hall the honor of seniority among Uni\u00ad versity buildings; both are accorded the same date of construction (1756) in offi\u00ad cial records, although it is probable that the President's House was not ready for occupancy until several months after Nassau Hall. Designed and built by Robert Smith, co-architect and builder of Nassau Hall, it was occupied by ten presidents of the College\u2014Burr, Ed\u00ad wards, Davies, Finley, Witherspoon, Smith, Green, Carnahan, Maclean and McCosh\u2014until Prospect was acquired as the President's residence in 1878. After President McCosh moved into Prospect, James Ormsbee Murray, Pro\u00ad fessor of English, occupied the old President's House and continued to live there after his appointment to the new office of dean of the faculty in 1883. Thereafter until 1967 it was the residence of the first seven deans of the faculty\u2014Murray, Winans, Fine, Magie, Eisenhart, Root, and Brown\u2014 and was called the Dean's House. In 1868, when it became the home of the Alumni Council, it was renamed in honor of John Maclean, Jr., founder of the Alumni Association and the last president to occupy the house through\u00ad out his administration; \"when he was president,\" John F. Hageman, histo\u00ad rian of the Princeton community wrote in 1878, \"he kept his mansion filled with guests as if it were a public house.\" McClenahan, Howard (1872-1935), second dean of the College, was brought up in a family of thirteen children\u2014an apt training-ground for the strict disciplinarian his students remember him to be. He completed the electrical engineering course at Princeton in 1895, earned a master's degree in science and became instruc\u00ad tor in physics in 1897, and was made a professor in 1906. He was a good teacher and an able administrator. In his younger days he was principal assistant to Cyrus Fogg Brackett, Professor of Physics and founder of the Department of Electrical Engineering. Later he was largely re\u00ad sponsible for the design and construc\u00ad tion of Palmer Physical Laboratory and for the choice and organization of its equipment. He had strong convictions and a dry sense of humor. Once while conducting demonstrations in a physics lecture, his foot upset a pail near the end of the demonstration table with a clatter. A voice from the rear of the lec\u00ad ture hall called out \"O sir, said \"I merely turned a lit\u00ad tle pale.\" As dean of the College from 1912 to 300 MCCORMICK HALL 1925, McClenahan proved a stern dis\u00ad ciplinarian whose summons to appear in his office \"without fail\" aroused ap\u00ad propriate apprehension in the heart of the recipient. His image as the rock of rectitude was regarded as fair game by the seniors in their annual Faculty Song. They poked fun at his baldness (\"His polish well becomes a Dean,/As does the polish of his bean.\"), derided his efforts to enforce Prohibition, called him hard-hearted for enforcing com\u00ad pulsory chapel attendance and, in 1922, when it fell to his lot to have to declare three star athletes ineligible, outra\u00ad geously suggested that Dean \"Mac\" had been invited by the authorities at New Haven to have his picture taken on the Yale fence. In the spring of 1925, when McClenahan resigned to accept ap\u00ad pointment as secretary of the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, the ragging in the Faculty Song was noticeably ab\u00ad sent, as the Class of 1925 showed the respect that lay beneath the jibes and protests of other years: Here's to Dean McClenahan; He's fair and square with every man. Our dass gives him a friendly grip, And honorary membership. During the decade that he directed the affairs of the Institute, McClena- han's most significant contribution was the planning, development, and equipping of an industrial and technical museum, which, at his suggestion, the Institute erected as a memorial to Ben\u00ad jamin Franklin. Both as director of the Museum and secretary of the Institute, he advanced the cause of scientific progress by encouraging and broaden\u00ad ing popular interest in the mechani\u00ad cal and electrical arts. Besides receiving a number of hon\u00ad orary degrees and appointments as an honorary member of the Royal Institu\u00ad tion of Great Britain and of the Board of Directors of the Deutsches Museum of Munich, McClenahan was also a trus\u00ad tee of Lincoln University, an associate trustee for graduate study of the Uni\u00ad versity of Pennsylvania, and a member of the American Philosophical Society. In a memorial written for the Society, McClenahan's Princeton colleague Dean William F. Magie paid tribute to his \"genial and winning manners\" and to his ability \"to plan on a large scale\" and, at the same time, \"to attend to the many details of a complex organiza\u00ad tion. \" The Philadelphia Evening Bulle\u00ad tin observed that, although he had de\u00ad voted over a quarter of a century of his life to Princeton, McClenahan had left his chief monument in Philadelphia: \"In building to the memory of Benja\u00ad min Franklin he wrote his own epitaph.\" McCormick Hall was built in 1922 with funds given to the University by Cyrus H. McCormick 1879 and his family; they also gave an addition in 1927. The building was designed by Ralph Adams Cram in a medieval Italian style to harmonize with the varied architecture of its neighbors (Whig, Murray-Dodge, Dod, and Brown). It was used by the School of Architecture as well as by the Department of Art and Archaeology until 1963, when the School was given its own separate building. In 1965, with funds provided by the $53 million campaign, McCormick was enlarged and its interior completely modernized at the same time that the adjoining Art Museum (q.v.) was erected. More adequate provision was thus made for the offices, classrooms, and lecture halls of the Department of Art and Archaeology, the Marquand Library, and the Index of Christian Art. JAMES McCOSH 301 Designed by Steinmann and Cain, the extensive additions were built of brownstone to conform with the older structure and done in a contemporary style to harmonize with the new museum. McCosh, James (1811-1894), eleventh president of Princeton, took office in 1868, precisely a century after his fellow-Scot, John Witherspoon (q.v.), whom he resembled in character, reli\u00ad gious ardor, statesmanship, devotion to the task of educating young men, and in the rolling rhythms of his native accent. He had been born on a farm near the banks of the River Doon in Ayrshire, the country of Bobby Burns, matricu\u00ad lated at the University of Glasgow in 1825, and moved on to Divinity Hall, University of Edinburgh, in 1829, for the study of religion, philosophy, and psychology. In the spring of 1834 he was licensed to preach by the presby\u00ad tery of Ayr. \"I preached all around,\" he later wrote, \"both in town and country, but chiefly in the country. I had a good horse, and set out on the Saturday with my sermons in a saddlebag behind me, preached twice on the Sabbath, and re\u00ad turned home on the Monday.\" His first ministerial charge was the Abbey Chapel in Arbroath, and his second at Brechin, Forfarshire, where the ear\u00ad nest young parson was soon involved, heart and soul, tooth and nail, in the reformation movement within the Church of Scotland. This movement, known as \"The Disruption,\" resulted in the organization of the Free Church, which McCosh himself called \"a great event in the history of Scotland,\" and to which he devoted his considerable powers as thinker, propagandist, and orator. During his pastorate at Brechin he met Isabella (daughter of the eminent physician Alexander Guthrie), who be\u00ad came his wife in September 1845. \"She had a good deal of the Guthrie charac\u00ad ter,\" he wrote. \"She was characteris\u00ad tically firm, and did not always yield to me. She advised and assisted in all my work as minister and professor.\" Having fought valiantly for the estab\u00ad lishment of the Free Church, McCosh went on to make his mark as professor of philosophy. He had been trained in the subject at Edinburgh, where his essay on Stoic Philosophy had made a stir in 1833. When John Stuart Mill's System of Logic appeared in 1843, McCosh took issue with Mill's apparent refusal to give due weight to super\u00ad natural powers, and counterattacked in 1850 with his own lively volume, The Method of Divine Government, Physi\u00ad cal and Moral, which was instrumental in leading to his appointment to the chair of Logic and Metaphysics at Queen's College, Belfast, founded that year by the British government \"for the promotion of nonsectarian education.\" During his sixteen-year tenure in Ire\u00ad land, he continued to develop and for\u00ad tify his philosophical position (\"a theory of the universe conditioned by Christian revelation\") in a series of bril\u00ad liant books: Typical Forms and Special Ends in Creation (with George Dickie, 1855); The Intuitions of the Mind In\u00ad ductively Investigated (1860); The Supernatural in Rehtion to the Natural (1862); and An Examination of Mr. J. S. Mill's Philosophy (1866), in which he returned to the demolition of his Brit\u00ad ish compeer so well begun in 1850. John Grier Hibben (q.v.) called this book \"one of the most convincing statements concerning the principles of the Intuitional philosophy in opposition to pure empiricism.\" McCosh's fame was now widespread in the English-speaking world, and on 302 JAMES McCOSH his first visit to the United States (1866) as a representative of the Evangelical Alliance, he was treated like a visiting potentate. When President John Mac\u00ad lean (q.v.) resigned his post in 1868, the Board of Trustees invited McCosh to serve as his successor. Just as the Revolutionary War had at\u00ad tenuated the student body and im\u00ad poverished the exchequer in Wither- spoon's time, so the Civil War had severely inhibited the further develop\u00ad ment of the College during the conflict and the early years of Reconstruction. McCosh's twenty-year presidency changed all that. Andrew Fleming West (q.v.), who entered as a freshman in 1870, compared the new president's influence to \"an electric shock, instan\u00ad taneous, paralyzing to the opposition, and stimulating to all who were not paralyzed.\" McCosh raised up a distin\u00ad guished faculty, revised and greatly modernized the plan of study, devel\u00ad oped elective course-options, instituted graduate work, found money for fellow\u00ad ships, brought in an expensive array of scientific equipment, dedicated the new Bonner-Marquand gymnasium to the greater glory of intercollegiate sport, founded schools of science, phi\u00ad losophy, and art, and entered upon an ambitious program of building and plantation that greatly enhanced and beautified the hitherto austere campus. He was also a teaching president, with regular classes in the history of philosophy and in psychology, as well as ad hoc meetings in his personal li\u00ad brary at Prospect where guest lecturers presented papers and led discussion over a wide range of philosophical and ethical topics. When Darwin's Origin of Species threatened to overturn age- old beliefs in God's creation and gov\u00ad ernment of the world, McCosh \"stood out almost alone\" among American clergymen in defending evolutionary doctrine, insisting that the Darwinian hypothesis, far from denying the exist\u00ad ence of God, only served \"to increase the wonder and mystery of the process of creation.\" A staunch believer in books as tools for the solution of these and other diffi\u00ad cult problems, McCosh strongly sup\u00ad ported the building-up collections. Under his aegis the octag\u00ad onal 70,000-volume Chancellor Green Library was dedicated in 1873 with a stirring address by the poet William Cullen Bryant. \"I remember,\" wrote McCosh, \"that some critics found fault with me for laying out too much money on stone and lime; but I proceeded on system, and knew what I was doing. I viewed the edifices as means to an end, at best as outward expressions and symbols of an internal life.\" His position on the college cur\u00ad riculum was much the same. He wanted to reject \"all that was factitious and pretentious,\" and to continue \"the good old solid\" course of study \"handed down from our fathers.\" No one, he said, \"should be a graduate of a college who does not know mathematics and classics, the one to solidify the reason\u00ad ing powers, and the other to refine the taste.\" At the same time he recognized the enormous advances that were being made in the physical sciences, as well as in philology, history, and psycholo\u00ad gy. From these branches of knowledge, Princeton students were encouraged to choose a wide range of electives to be taken \"side by side with obligatory and disciplinary courses.\" In the winter of 1885 President Charles W. Eliot of Harvard came to New York\u2014a sufficiently neutral terri\u00ad tory\u2014to conduct a debate with McCosh on the ideal college curricu\u00ad lum. Princeton's president was highly JAMES McCOSH 303 critical of Eliot's scheme which allowed students to choose, virtually ad libitum, among some two hundred courses. This, said McCosh, obviously encour\u00ad aged dilettantism, everything being \"scattered like the star dust out of which worlds are said to have been made.\" Even worse, Harvardians were not obliged to attend classes, with the result that a typical professor often found himself lecturing to a roomful of empty seats. Matters were more sensi\u00ad bly ordered at Princeton, where regu\u00ad lar attendance was required, and where the whole curriculum had been care\u00ad fully weighed and logically worked out for all four years, including obligatory core courses and a reasonable variety of solid electives, so that one subject led to another, and the student could develop his powers in an orderly fashion. Most Princetonians believed that McCosh had won the debate handily despite, or perhaps because of, his seventy-three years. He was seventy-seven when he re\u00ad tired from the presidency in 1888, mov\u00ad ing out of \"Prospect\" to the new house, planned and built under his supervision approximately on the site later oc\u00ad cupied by Quadrangle Club. His part\u00ad ing words to the College reflected the noble simplicity of his nature: It is not without feeling that I take the step which I now take. It recalls that other eventful step in my life when I gave up my living, one of the most enviable in the Church of Scot\u00ad land, when the liberties of Christ's people were interfered with. . . . I may feel a momentary pang in leav\u00ad ing the fine mansion, which a friend gave to the college and to me\u2014it is as when Adam was driven out of Eden. I am reminded keenly that my days of active work are over. But I take the step firmly and decidedly. The shadows are lengthening, the day is declining. My age, seven years above the threescore and ten, compels it, Providence points to it, conscience enjoins it, the good of the college demands it. . . . I leave the college in a healthy state, intellectually, mor\u00ad ally, and religiously, thanks be to God and man. I leave it with the prayer, that the blessing of Heaven and the good-will of men may rest upon it, and with the prospect of its having greater usefulness in the fu\u00ad ture than even that which it has had in the past. His successor, Francis L. Patton (q.v.), observed admiringly that McCosh was \"more than a model Pres\u00ad ident: he was a model ex-President.\" This meant that, having once laid down his staff of office, he made no sub\u00ad sequent attempt to use it as a cudgel. He was, however, deeply touched when the Class of 1889 unanimously requested that their diplomas should carry his signature along with Patton's. He met their delegation in the front hall of his house, listened to their words, dabbed quickly at his eyes with a handkerchief drawn from the inside pocket of his clerical frock-coat, and called to his wife. She felt \"no scruples\" about her own tears, seizing her hus\u00ad band's handkerchief, vigorously wiping her eyes, and saying tenderly, \"James, your lads are nae for forgettin' you.\" While McCosh lived, his tall, mas\u00ad sive, and somewhat stooped figure was often seen strolling along the walk that bore his name, admiring the shrubs and trees he had planted and the way the sunlight struck the stone of the buildings he had caused to be erected. When passing students bowed to him, his response was often the same: \"I 304 McCOSH FACULTY FELLOWSHIPS know ye, whooo whatsyour- name?\" And the students, having iden\u00ad tified themselves and listened to a few \"wurruds\" of greeting, commonly went away exalted. For most of them knew and believed the old man's hearty boast, \"It's me collidge. I made it.\" Sixty of them gathered on his eightieth birthday in 1891 to present him with a golden pitcher inscribed with a legend in Greek from The Clouds of Aris\u00ad tophanes: \"May prosperity attend him who, while passing into the vale of man's decline, still cultivates wisdom and imbues his mind with learning ever new.\" As if the shade of Witherspoon, which had symbolically presided at his induction to the presidency, were still in friendly control, McCosh died quietly on November 16, 1894\u2014 precisely a hundred years and a day after the date of Witherspoon's death. These stalwart Scots, in their respec\u00ad tive centuries, had each contributed mightily to the growth of Princeton, and the modern university is indebted to them both. Carlos Baker McCosh Faculty Fellowships, named in honor of James McCosh, the Col\u00ad lege's eleventh president, are awarded by the Faculty Committee on Ap\u00ad pointments and Advancements for in\u00ad dividual scholarship in the humanities and social sciences. Established in 1962, the McCosh Fellowships are supported by an annual appropriation of $50,000 from the Jadwin Foundation. McCosh Hall (built in 1906) was, as Woodrow Wilson announced, \"the gift of a small group of friends of the Uni\u00ad versity\" who were also \"devoted to the memory of James McCosh.\" When constructed it was the largest building on the Campus, extending four hundred feet along McCosh Walk and one hundred feet on Washington Road. It contained four large lecture rooms, fourteen recitation rooms, and twenty- six smaller rooms especially planned for the preceptorial conferences which had been introduced the year before. McCosh Hall was designed by Raleigh C. Gildersleeve in the Tudor Gothic style of architecture then domi\u00ad nant at Princeton, with exterior walls of gray Indiana limestone. Situated at the crossroads of University life, the locus during term-time of daily faculty and student dialogue, the scene over the years of public lectures, open forums, class meetings, concerts, celebrations, demonstrations, and protests, it is like the man it was built to keep in memory: substantial, familiar, appealing, hand\u00ad some, purposeful. It fulfills President Wilson's expectation that \"this noble memorial to our beloved one-time leader\" would be one of the finest ornaments and at the same time one of the most useful buildings on the Campus. McCosh Infirmary was erected in 1925, replacing an infirmary built on the same site in 1892. Both were named for Isabella McCosh, \"whose kindly sympathy and substantial com\u00ad forts\" in days when students were fewer and younger, and living condi\u00ad tions rugged, endeared her to her hus\u00ad band's \"boys\" during the twenty years of his presidency, 1868-1888. One of them, Alexander J. Kerr 1879, has left us this picture of Mrs. McCosh on one of her missions: She had given strict orders to the Scottish college proctor, Matt Gold-McCOSH INFIRMARY 305 ie, that any student who was ill should be immediately reported to her. Her orders were faithfully obeyed and when any boy was sick . . . she would take her large basket, place in it one of her own bed sheets, a pillow case, a towel, a wash cloth, some of her own jams and jellies, homemade cookies and tempting cakes and a jug of tea, over which she would place a tea caddy to keep it hot. She would then carry the basket to the sickroom, no matter though she had to climb four flights of iron stairs to do so. . . . She would tap on the door and say, \"May I come in?\" But without wait\u00ad ing for a reply she would enter and, after expressing a mother's sym\u00ad pathy, immediately proceed to wash the face, chest and hands of the young man, put the clean sheet on his bed, the pillow case on his pillow, brush his hair and make him as com\u00ad fortable as possible and encourage him to eat the good things she had brought and to drink a cup of her good tea. Then, sitting down at his desk, she would write a note to his mother, telling her she need not worry about her boy, as \"we are look\u00ad ing after him here.\" Urged on by Mrs. McCosh, who was the daughter of the eminent Scottish physician Dr. Alexander Guthrie, Pres\u00ad ident McCosh repeatedly pressed on the trustees the need for an infirmary, but not until after he had retired was a campaign begun for funds to build one and the decision made to name it for Mrs. McCosh at a trustees meeting in 1891. George B. Stewart 1876, an old student of McCosh's and by then a trus\u00ad tee, was a guest at the McCosh home at the time and broke the news at dinner, to the delight of Dr. McCosh and the dismay of Mrs. McCosh. \"Oh, they must not do that,\" she protested, \"I don't want them to call it after me.\" \"You have nothing to do about it, Isabella,\" said McCosh firmly \"they will do as they please.\" The necessary funds having been raised in response to an appeal by the Sanitary Committee of the faculty, of which Dean James O. Murray was chairman, the cornerstone of the first infirmary was laid at commencement in 1892 and the building was ready for use the following April. Two years later Mrs. McCosh sent Murray a $1000 bond and asked that the income be used for the support and care of stu\u00ad dents confined in the infirmary. Mrs. McCosh's gift was the first of many which Princeton women were to make to the Infirmary. In 1903, on the strong recommendation of Mrs. Wood- row Wilson, a group of women known as the \"Ladies Auxiliary,\" organized the year before to furnish women's lounges for social occasions in the new Univer\u00ad sity Gymnasium, resolved to attach it\u00ad self to the Isabella McCosh Infirmary in both name and deed. Annual dues were used for the pur\u00ad chase of supplies and equipment, and gifts were obtained for the initial salary of the first University Physician (ap\u00ad pointed by the trustees in 1908 on the recommendation of the auxiliary), for a fund to help needy students pay for extra nursing and special physicians, and for an endowment fund that even\u00ad tually reached $200,000. Wives of Princeton presidents, fol\u00ad lowing Mrs. McCosh's example, have shown special concern for sick students and have been frequent visitors to the Infirmary. With steadily increasing enrollment, the original Infirmary soon became in\u00ad adequate, and the auxiliary began a 306 McCOSH WALK fund for a new building. In the capital gifts campaign at the end of the First World War, a committee of women raised an additional sum of $345,000 from 1500 donors, most of whom were women, which made possible the con\u00ad struction of the present Infirmary. Its cornerstone was laid at commencement in 1924, and it was dedicated at a com\u00ad mencement meeting of the auxiliary a year later. This building was designed by Charles Z. Klauder, who used rough- textured red brick and limestone trim to tie it in with its neighbors, Palmer and Guyot Halls. A portrait of Mrs. McCosh, painted by John W. Alexan\u00ad der a few years before she died in her ninety-third year, hangs in the oak- paneled waiting room. Mrs. John Grier Hibben, who as a young faculty wife in the 1890s took Mrs. McCosh as her model, was president of the Ladies Auxiliary for many years and presided at the building's dedication. After her death a tribute to \"her unfailing devo\u00ad tion in guarding and guiding the spirit of this Infirmary\" was carved on an oak panel in the entrance hall. The first doctor attached to the In\u00ad firmary was John McD. Carnochan 1896, who was appointed University Physician in 1908 and served in that ca\u00ad pacity part-time while carrying on his private practice in town until his death in 1929. Employment of full-time Uni\u00ad versity physicians began after the or\u00ad ganization in 1911 of the forerunner of today's University Health Services (q-v.). The Infirmary has long had a reputa\u00ad tion for good food and a cheerful at\u00ad mosphere. One reason for both was the long-time presence on the housekeep\u00ad ing staff of three members of the Hillian family, the first of whom came north from Cheraw, South Carolina, in 1917. For half a century they contributed to the Infirmary's healing ways: Mabel and Bessie as cooks, Tom as head or\u00ad derly. Mabel retired after forty-seven years of service. At the golden anniver\u00ad sary party the Infirmary gave Bessie on her retirement, she spoke of meeting sons of students she had known in ear\u00ad lier years and, recently, their grand\u00ad children, and that this made her proud. When Tom died, the Ladies Auxiliary hung a framed tribute to him in the en\u00ad trance hall of the Infirmary, which said that for forty-five years he had always been cheerful, dedicated, and thought\u00ad ful, fulfilling ministrari, sed trare.\" McCosh Walk was named for President James McCosh, who enjoyed strolling there in days when it extended only from Prospect Gate to Washington Road. It grew longer as the Campus expanded, eventually describing an east-west axis from Lockhart Hall on University Place through the gateway north of Little Hall to the steps at Washington Road opposite the Wood- row Wilson School Plaza. A latter-day extension of the walk continues along the south side of Frick and the rear of the University Press, past the Mudd Manuscript Library, to the Engineer\u00ad ing Quadrangle. McMaster, John Bach (1852-1932) began his monumental eight-volume History of the People of the United States while he was an instructor in civil engineering at Princeton. His in\u00ad terest in American history had been stimulated by contact with the still ex\u00ad panding frontier on a fossil-collecting trip he led to Wyoming in 1878. His Princeton colleagues were apparently unaware of this interest, and the publi-JAMES MADISON, JR. 307 cation of the first volume of his history in 1883 led President McCosh to re\u00ad mark that \"the sun had risen without a dawn.\" According to William Berryman Scott, who as a graduate student had accompanied McMaster to Wyoming, William Milligan Sloane, Professor of History and Political Science, tried to induce the trustees to establish a chair of American history for McMaster. But, said Scott, Sloane \"encountered that density and obtuseness which some\u00ad times afflicts governing bodies. McMas\u00ad ter had been teaching engineering; why shouldn't he stick to that? Ne sutor ultra crepidam [Shoemaker, stick to your last]; they remembered that much Latin.\" The University of Pennsylvania thereupon called McMaster, who was only thirty-one, to a professorship in American history, which he held for thirty-seven years. His innovative books led the way in the development of social and economic history, which previously had been largely neglected for war and politics. In 1925 Princeton invited him back to receive an honorary doctorate of let\u00ad ters. \"His aim,\" Dean West said in presenting him for the degree, \"was . . . to portray intimately the real life of the American people . . . to live in the times which he described and to see things as they were and thus to see the truth of history.\" McMillan, Charles (1841-1927) was the College of New Jersey's first engineer\u00ad ing professor. A graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, he had been a draftsman and engineer for various New York water works, and a professor at Rensselaer and Lehigh before being called to Princeton in 1875 to organize a Department of Civil Engineering. He was said to be particularly profi\u00adcient in applied mathematics, a skillful topographical draftsman, a lucid lec\u00ad turer, and a man of high professional ideals. His students found him a strict and, at times, severe teacher, but many discovered the kindness behind his somewhat dour exterior, particularly when they returned to him after gradu\u00ad ation for help and advice. As Borough Engineer, McMillan de\u00ad signed Princeton's first sewerage system and planned the town's modern streets. He was often consulted by the College, the Princeton Water Company, and the state of New Jersey about sanitation and water problems. He retired in 1914, having served thirty-nine years as Professor of Civil Engineering and Applied Mathematics, and lived to see his pioneering efforts culminate in the formation of the School of Engineering in 1922. MacMillan Building was named in honor of Edward A. MacMillan '14, Superintendent of Grounds and Build\u00ad ings from 1921 to 1957. Designed by John P. Moran '51 and built in 1962 south of Baker Rink, it brought to\u00ad gether under one roof the office of Physical Planning and the offices and shops of the Department of Physical Plant. Madison, James, Jr., 1771 (1751-1836), statesman and political philosopher, should, by tradition, have attended the College of William and Mary in Wil\u00ad liamsburg. Most aspiring young Vir\u00ad ginia men of his family's station did so. Three influences, however, diverted him. One was his tutor, Thomas Mar\u00ad tin, Princeton 1762, who persuaded him of the merits of the young institu\u00ad tion in New Jersey. Another was Presi\u00ad dent John Witherspoon's fame, which had begun to spread through the col-308 JAMES MADISON, JR. onies. The third was Madison's family, which had differences with the admin\u00ad istration of the Virginia college. So in the summer of 1769 Madison, the eld\u00ad est of ten children, set out for the Col\u00ad lege of New Jersey. Entering as a sophomore, Madison joined a group of students who re\u00ad mained his close and lifelong friends: William Bradford, Jr., 1772, later U.S. attorney general; Hugh Henry Brack- enridge, and Freneau, 1771, the \"poet of the Revolution.\" Other future leaders whom he came to know at the college\u2014which, more than any other, drew its students from throughout the colonies\u2014included Gunning Bedford, Jr., 1771, signer of the Constitution from Delaware; Samuel Spring, 1771, Massachusetts cleric and founder in 1808 of Andover Theological Seminary; and Aaron Burr, Jr., 1772, senator from New York and vice president of the United States, who was later responsi\u00ad ble for introducing Madison to the widow, Dolly Payne Todd. Samuel Stanhope Smith, 1769, Witherspoon's successor as president of the College, became Madison's college tutor and lasting friend. And Witherspoon him\u00ad self served as Madison's moral precep\u00ad tor and faithful champion. These were, as Madison called them in 1774, his \"old Nassovian friends.\" The College had begun to feel the winds of revolutionary politics by 1770, but Madison's two years of study were spent in reasonable tranquillity. He worked hard to master the classics and the great works of the Scottish En\u00ad lightenment, often sleeping, despite his somewhat sickly disposition, less than five hours a night. Like many later undergraduates, he came to college with a smattering of French, but, un\u00ad like them, he spoke it with a Scottish accent. \"Jemmy,\" as he was affection\u00ad ately called, also revealed a side of him\u00ad self that others, usually meeting this soft-voiced man on serious public occa\u00ad sions, later mistook for a dour and stiff personality. He was one of the earliest members of the Whig Society, and spent much of his time debating with its members the affairs of government and society. He also wrote lusty, ribald doggerel and must have kept his eye on the alert for female companions, for he later wrote wistfully to his friend Brad\u00ad ford that he knew \"no place so over\u00ad stocked with Old-Maids as Princeton.\" Witherspoon, however, is said later to have told Thomas Jefferson \"that in the whole career of Mr. Madison at Princeton, he had never known him to do or say an indiscreet thing.\" After completing his junior and senior work in one year, Madison took his degree in the fall of 1771. However, he remained at the college until the spring of the next year to read some law and learn some Hebrew under With\u00ad erspoon's tutelage. Returning in 1772 to the pre-revolutionary calm of the Virginia piedmont, he buckled down to a regimen of reading and tutoring his younger siblings. He had warned Brad\u00ad ford to avoid \"those impertinent fops that abound in every city\"; yet he him\u00ad self felt isolated in the Old Dominion. Depression and doubt beset him at the very time that his brilliant mind and celebrated convictions were taking ma\u00ad ture shape. Given Witherspoon's influ\u00ad ence, Madison might have entered the pulpit, but he did not do so, his thin voice possibly deterring him. The prac\u00ad tice of law, it seems, also did not appeal to him. What might otherwise have be\u00ad come of this promising but unsure young man is impossible to say. But, as with so many of his generation, the Revolution helped resolve the di-JAMES MADISON, JR. 309 lemma. It gave his life a focus, at last re\u00ad leased his energies, and dispelled his gloom. Not hardy enough to join the army, he instead helped govern Orange County, Virginia, as a member of its Committee of Safety and then helped draft the state's first constitution as a member of the Virginia general convention in 1776. These opportuni\u00ad ties marked the beginning of one of the most distinguished public careers in the nation's history. During these early years of national service, Madison continued to harbor doubts about his own capacities. Even after he had served in the Continental Congress as its youngest member and won election to the Virginia House of Delegates, where with Jefferson he played a major role in the passage of the historic Virginia Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, his continued self-doubting elicited from Samuel Stanhope Smith the exasperated wish that \"you had the same high opinion of yourself that others have.\" Yet Madison steadily accumulated the respect of others with whom he served in Virginia and the Continental Congress. (He re\u00ad turned to Princeton at least once during this period when the Congress fled Philadelphia in 1783 to escape the mutiny of American troops.) Bending all his efforts to serve the union, he at\u00ad tended the Annapolis Convention of 1786 and, at the Philadelphia Conven\u00ad tion of 1787, was the guiding spirit be\u00ad hind the far-sighted Virginia Plan, which brought a working federalism into being. Without his careful note- taking during the Convention debates, we should know little of the proceed\u00ad ings of that historic meeting. His pres\u00ad ence and intelligence during the Con\u00ad vention, acknowledged by almost everyone, won him enduring renown as \"Father of the Constitution.\" His work in Philadelphia done, Madison turned to securing the Con\u00ad stitution's acceptance. His efforts to\u00ad ward ratification were essential. His ar\u00ad guments in behalf of the Constitution at the Virginia ratifying convention car\u00ad ried that state for the Constitution, without which the ratification of New York might have been lost and hence the federal union with it. Moreover, his co-authorship, with Hamilton and Jay, of the Federalist Papers, written in 1787 and 1788 to win over doubters and opponents to the new Constitution and embodying the ideas and learning that Madison had started to accumulate at Nassau Hall some twenty years before, produced the nation's greatest contri\u00ad bution to Western political science. Madison's 10th Federalist, which over\u00ad turned conventional arguments about the dangers of an extended republic and provided an analysis of the social bases of political factions and a plan to check their worst effects, alone worked a revolution in political theory and is rightly considered a classic expression of American thought. For his service during this period, Princeton awarded Madison a Doctor of Laws honoris causa in 1787. Witherspoon wrote Madison at the time to say that Princetonians were proud to recognize in this way \"one of their own sons who had done them so much honor by his public service.\" In the 1790s, Madison served in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he sponsored the Bill of Rights and, with Jefferson's encouragement, cre\u00ad ated a legislative opposition to Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton that helped lay the basis for the Democratic- Republican party, the first modern political party in the world. In 1798, in protest against the infamous Alien and Sedition Acts, he wrote the controver-310 MADISON HALL sial Virginia Resolution, which put for\u00ad ward for the first time the doctrine of state interposition, a doctrine that would deeply influence the later theories of Nullification and Secession. Upon the inauguration of his close friend Jefferson to the presidency in 1801, Madison became secretary of state. After eight years of demanding State Department service during the era of the Napoleonic Wars, he became in 1809 fourth president of the United States. His two terms in the White House were fraught with the difficulties born of war and bitter partisan strug\u00ad gles. Yet Madison and his administra\u00ad tion were able to see the nation through its - Second War for Independence, which finally ended Britain's threat to the growing republic. He retired in 1817 after over forty years of public service, but continued to work for the public good by helping Jefferson found the University of Virginia, by serving as its rector after Jefferson's death, and by participating in the Virginia Constitu\u00ad tional Convention of 1829. Madison always maintained a lively interest in the College of New Jersey. In 1796, he made a contribution toward the purchase of materia^ for instruc\u00ad tion in chemistry. And in 1826 he ac\u00ad cepted election as first president of the newly formed Alumni Association of Nassau Hall, a post he held until his death. He contributed regularly to the Alumni Fund in his last years and, upon his death at 85 as the last surviv\u00ad ing signer of the Constitution, he be\u00ad queathed $1,000 to the College library from the proceeds of his posthumously published \"Notes\" on the debates at Philadelphia, the largest gift to the li\u00ad brary until after the Civil War. Princeton's sense of Madison's place is perhaps best revealed by the order of honors listed on the plaque beneath his portrait in Maclean House: James Madison\u2014Class of 1771 First President of the Alumni Association Fourth President of the United States Madison's greatest contribution to the nation's history was his ability to translate theory into institutions and norms. No more apt characterization of him can be found than Jefferson's in 1812: \"I do not know in the world a man of purer integrity, more dispassionate, disinterested, and devoted to genuine Republicanism; nor could I in the whole scope of America and Europe point out an abler head.\" James M. Banner, Jr. Madison Hall is the collective designa\u00ad tion for the freshmen and sophomore dining halls erected in 1916 at the corner of Nassau Street and University Place and named for James Madison 1771. Five great Gothic dining halls are grouped around a central kitchen\u2014 Upper and Lower Cloister (next to the cloister that forms the west side of Holder Court), Upper and Sub Eagle (named for the carvings at the ends of the ceiling beams) on University Place, and Madison Hall on Nassau Street. Designed by Day and Klauder, this imposing group of buildings was the gift of Mrs. Russell Sage, the Classes of 1916, 1917, and 1918, and others. They occupy the site of a hotel called Univer\u00ad sity Hall, which, after eight unprofita\u00ad ble years, was given over to the College in 1883 for use as a dormitory and later as the University dining halls. Madison, James, Medal is awarded an\u00ad nually to a Graduate School alumnus who has attained distinction in his pro\u00ad fessional career, in the advancement of higher education, or in public service. It is named for the fourth president of the United States who, after receiving WILLIAM FRANCIS MAGIE 311 his bachelor's degree from the College in 1771, remained here another year to continue his studies under President Witherspoon. Madison Medalists have included John Bardeen Ph.D. '36, twice a Nobel laureate in physics; Thornton Wilder, A.M. '26, Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist and playwright; William O. Baker Ph.D. '39, president, Andrew '54, mathematics professor in the Uni\u00ad versity later at the Institute for Ad\u00ad vanced Study. Magie, William Francis 1879 (1858- 1943), a founder of the American Physi\u00ad cal Society and its president from 1910 to 1912, taught physics at Princeton for almost half a century and was chairman of the department during twenty of its formative years. He was one of the able group of alumni of the McCosh era (e.g., Wilson, Fine, West, Hibben) who nurtured Princeton's development from a college to a university. Magie's early interests were hu\u00ad manistic. In his sophomore year he tried reading his way through the mas\u00ad terpieces of English literature on his own. As an upperclassman he came under the influence of Cyrus Fogg Brackett, Charles A. Young, and Ar\u00ad nold McCosh (q.v.), whose \"dogmatic methods aroused our antagonism but made us think.\" Magie was an editor of the Princetontan as were his classmate Woodrow Wilson and Henry B. Fine 1880. He stood near the top of his class all four years and at graduation was class valedictorian. He had thought of following his father into the practice of law, but, stirred by news of the first Princeton expedition to the West in 1877 and the subsequent paleontologi- cal researches of William Berryman Scott and Henry Fairfield Osborn, Magie \"could not help wishing\" that he too \"might have a chance to work in some scientific field.\" His chance came toward the end of his senior year, when Professor Brack\u00ad ett, who was carrying all of the work of physics instruction single-handed, suf\u00ad fered a breakdown, and his friends in\u00ad sisted that he should have an assistant. Brackett offered Magie the job on Commencement Day, and he ac\u00ad cepted. \"I did not then know it,\" Magie told his classmates fifty years later, \"but I now know that the subject of physics, into which I was inducted in this somewhat casual way, was the one sub\u00ad ject which was best suited to my habits of thought. I never had enough origi\u00ad nality or mathematical skill to do great original work, but I always loved the fundamental and philosophical aspects of the subject, and loved to teach it.\" Magie did not neglect the scholarly side of his career. After collaborating on a small piece of research on the electri\u00ad cal discharge, he and Henry B. Fine were given leave in 1884 and went to Germany, where Magie studied at the University of Berlin under the great Helmholtz, and earned his Ph. D. with a thesis on the measurement of surface tensions. A decade later he collabo\u00ad rated with two physicians in publish\u00ad ing the first paper in this country on the possible use of Roentgen's newly dis\u00ad covered X-rays in surgery. He later published occasional papers on the properties of solutions, and was the au\u00ad thor of a highly regarded account of the rise and content of physical theories, Principles of Physics. His greatest contribution, however, was in teaching and administration. After 1889, when Brackett began his 312 THOMAS MANN graduate program in electrical en\u00ad gineering, Magie took over the under\u00ad graduate courses in physics, and shared increasingly in the administration of the department. On Brackett's retirement in 1908, Magie succeeded him as chairman and, a little later, as Joseph Henry Professor of Physics. Magie and Brackett worked closely with Dean Fine in building up a strong physics department as part of Fine's efforts, as President Wilson's dean of the faculty, to strengthen all the science depart\u00ad ments. In the controversy between President Wilson and Dean West, Fine supported Wilson, but Magie sided with West. When Hibben became president in 1912, Magie accepted appointment as Henry B. Fine's successor as dean of the faculty; he held this office until 1925. He continued to serve as chair\u00ad man of the physics department until his retirement in 1929. At Commencement that year President Hibben conferred on him an honorary ScD. As departmental chairman and dean, Magie was noted for his calmness, pa\u00ad tience, and fairness. Allen Shenstone '14, his student, later his colleague, and then his successor as chairman of the department, said that the cordial rela\u00ad tionship that had always been main\u00ad tained in the physics department \"through agreements and disagree\u00ad ments\" was due to the enduring influ\u00ad ence of the personality of Magie, \"a man of firm character but gentle man\u00ad ners.\" The Magie Apartments for junior faculty on the north side of Lake Car\u00ad negie, next to the Hibben Apartments, were named for Dean Magie in 1965. Mann, Thomas (1875-1955), self-exiled German novelist and winner of the 1929 Nobel Prize in Literature, lived in Princeton for two and a half years 1938-1941, and was formally associated with the University during the aca\u00ad demic years 1938-1940. Mann had left Germany in 1933 when Hitler rose to power. After five years in Switzerland he was encouraged by friends to settle in this country, and President Dodds and Dean Gauss per\u00ad suaded him to accept appointment as a lecturer in the University. While here Mann gave public lectures on Goethe, Wagner, and Freud and guest lectures in upperclass courses on the German romantic movement and the European novel. The University made him a Doctor of Letters honoris causa at a special con\u00ad vocation in Nassau Hall in May 1939. In a moving response Mann expressed gratitude for his new home in America and spoke of gratitude in general: \"To be grateful for all life's blessings, . . . is the best condition for a happy life. A joke, a good meal, a fine spring day, a work of art, a human personality, a voice, a glance\u2014but this is not all. For there is another kind of gratitude . . . the feeling that makes us thankful for suffering, for the hard and heavy things of life, for the deepening of our natures which perhaps only suffering can bring. During their stay in Princeton Mr. and Mrs. Mann lived in the red brick Georgian house at the corner of Stockton Street and Library Place. Here, working three or four hours every morning, seven days a week, he completed Lotte in Weimar and started the fourth volume of the Joseph tales. Here, also, he wrote his essays against Nazism. Mann found Princeton pleasant. \"This town is like a park,\" he wrote a friend in Europe, \"with wonderful op\u00ad portunities for walks and with astonish-JACQUES MARITAIN 313 ing trees that now, during Indian sum\u00ad mer, glow in the most magnificent col\u00ad ors.\" He and Albert Einstein, who had been friends in Germany, met fre\u00ad quently in each other's homes. Eventu\u00ad ally a warmer climate lured Mann to California, where he remained until 1953 when he returned to Switzerland to spend his last years. In 1964 a stone tablet with the words THOMAS MANN LIVED HERE 1938-1941\" was placed in the brick wall at the front of the house at 65 Stockton Street (now occupied by the Aquinas Institute). At its dedication Professor Victor Lange, then chairman of the de\u00ad partment of German, expressed the hope that as \"a lasting reminder of Thomas Mann's presence in Princeton\" it might \"strengthen the spirit of coura\u00ad geous humanism among us and reaffirm the vision of a community of free men to which his life and work bore such eloquent testimony.\" Maritain, Jacques (1882-1973), French philosopher and man of letters, was a professor of philosophy in the Univer\u00ad sity from 1948 to 1952 and continued to make his home in Princeton until 1960. The author of more than fifty books, he was a preeminent interpreter of the thought of Thomas Aquinas and a crea\u00ad tive thinker in his own right in metaphysics, moral philosophy, social and political philosophy, the philoso\u00ad phy of art, and the theory of knowl\u00ad edge. Maritain, brought up in liberal Prot\u00ad estantism, and his wife, Raissa, a Rus\u00ad sian Jew whom he met when they were students at the Sorbonne, were con\u00ad verted to the Roman Catholic faith two years after their marriage in 1904. For many years Maritain was professor of philosophy at the Institut Catholique de Paris. He was in the United States on a lecture tour in 1940 when the Germans overran France, and he re\u00ad mained here in exile throughout the war. He became a visiting professor at Columbia University; during 1941- 1942 he came to Princeton three days a week to give a graduate course in medieval philosophy. After the war Maritain was French Ambassador to the Vatican from 1945 to 1948. He came back to Princeton in 1946 to take part in a conference on \"The Humanistic Tradition in the Cen\u00ad tury Ahead\" and to accept an honorary degree at the University's Bicentennial Celebration. The following year he was tendered an invitation to join the Princeton faculty, under unusual cir\u00ad cumstances that he later recalled in his book Reflections on America (1958). \"In December, 1947, returning to Rome from Mexico City,\" he wrote, \"I stopped in New York for a few hours to change planes. President Dodds was there; he had been so kind as to come to New York to offer me\u2014if I should resign my diplomatic post at the Vatican\u2014a professorship at Princeton University, precisely in my capacity as a philosopher dedicated to the spirit and principles of Thomas Aquinas. The fact that Princeton is a secular univer\u00ad sity of Presbyterian origin made him only more interested in such a teaching appointment.\" Maritain accepted and came to Princeton as professor of phi\u00ad losophy in 1948. His years at Princeton were felicitous ones. \"In no European university,\" he wrote, \"would I have found the spirit of liberty and conge\u00ad niality I found at Princeton in teaching moral philosophy in the light of Thomas Aquinas.\" In addition to a graduate course in moral philosophy he also contributed to the undergraduate Special Program in the Humanities. He retired in 1952 at 314 ALLAN MARQUAND age seventy and began to enjoy, in his words, \"the Elysian status of an Emeritus.\" He continued to live in Princeton and to contribute to its intel\u00ad lectual life until the death of his wife in 1960, when he retired to a monastery in Toulouse. There he died on April 28, 1973, at the age of ninety. Maritain was a warm, gentle man. He was admired, one of his colleagues said, even by those of different philo\u00ad sophical convictions, \"for his lifelong zeal for truth and impassioned com\u00ad mitment to freedom . . . his humility, his charity, his fraternal attitude toward all that is.\" Marquand, Allan (1853-1924), founded the Department of Art and Archaeology and for more than forty years devoted his talents and his means to making it one of the best in the country. He shared with Charles Eliot Norton of Harvard the distinction of being the first to introduce the serious study of art into the curriculum of the American college. The son of Henry Gurdon Mar\u00ad quand, a New York banker and one of the founders and a chief benefactor of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he was educated at St. Paul's School and at Princeton. In college he was an excel\u00ad lent student, an accomplished gymnast, first-place winner in three track events, and president of the Boating Club, which sponsored the crew. He graduated second in his class (1874) and was Latin salutatorian and class presi\u00ad dent. His classmates rejoiced in his success because, they said, \"jealousy and envy of others were not in him.\" After graduation he studied theology for three years at Princeton Seminary and at Union Seminary in New York, and then, after a year of study at the University of Berlin, went to Johns Hopkins, where he received his Ph.D. in philosophy. At Johns Hopkins, he invented an ingenious \"logic machine\" \u2014a forerunner of the computer\u2014 which is preserved in Firestone Li\u00ad brary. He was called back to Princeton as lecturer in logic and tutor in Latin in 1881. President McCosh, detecting an unorthodox, unCalvinistic bent in Marquand's teaching of philosophy, encouraged him to undertake instead the teaching of the history of art. He became an instructor in this subject in 1882 and, a year later, first incumbent of a professorship of art and archaeol\u00ad ogy, endowed by his uncle, Frederick Marquand. He held this chair until 1910 when he relinquished it in order to provide funds for an additional professor in the department; thereafter he served the University without salary. He made important gifts to the Art Museum, of which he was the first director, and supplied the department's library with books and photographs from his own collection and paid for other de\u00ad partmental purchases out of his own pocket. He also founded and financed the Princeton Monographs in Art and Archaeology. His generosity was matched by the personal interest he took in his col\u00ad leagues and his students and by the in\u00ad fluence he exerted on them. \"There was in his character,\" Professor C. Rufus Morey said, \"a refinement that had nothing about it of the fastidious, but rejected nonetheless the false and unworthy with unerring discernment. Without conscious effort on his part, his life and work evoked in his pupils and associates a standard of precision and candor in scholarship.\" Marquand's devoted effort brought forth a good harvest. In 1882 he was the ALLAN MARQUAND 315 lone instructor of a few students. Forty years later he presided over an art fac\u00ad ulty of thirteen members who gave six\u00ad teen courses elected by eight hundred undergraduates. In all the colleges east of the Mississippi, half of the teachers of art had been trained in the graduate curriculum he had developed. WORK ON THE DELLA ROBBIAS A chief ornament of the Princeton Monographs in Archaeology was Marquand's own life-work\u2014his eight-volume catalogue raisonne of the works of the ateliers of members of the Delia Robbia family, fifteenth- and sixteenty-century Florentine sculptors and ceramists. interest in these art\u00ad ists began with an altarpiece by Andrea Delia Robbia that his father bought for the Metropolitan Museum in 1882. After publishing a study of this altar\u00ad piece in the American Journal of Ar\u00ad chaeology in 1891, he made a tour of Italy (the first of many) in search of un\u00ad studied Delia Robbia works, and his preliminary observations appeared in the Journal and in Scribner's Magazine in 1893. A lapse of almost twenty years be\u00ad tween his initial quest for material and the appearance of the first published results of his investigations, was due in part to the demands of other publica\u00ad tions, including his work on Greek Ar\u00ad chitecture, and in part to the thorough\u00ad ness of his scholarship. The first Delia Robbia volume, which inaugurated the Princeton Monographs, appeared in 1912; the second, in 1914. Then, after five more years of research, five more volumes appeared in rapid succession between 1919 and 1922. Failing health interrupted completion of the eighth and last volume, but the manuscript he left was so far advanced that it was read\u00ad ily completed by his colleagues after his death. All eight volumes were repub\u00ad lished in 1972. Shy and somewhat hesitant in manner, Marquand was most effective as a teacher in small groups. There his own example generated standards of accuracy and thoroughness, and his kindliness encouraged his students to develop their own views. His famous course in Italian sculpture, through which all the graduate students of the department passed at some time in their careers, was noted for the com\u00ad pleteness with which it explored all of the important monuments and the pub\u00ad lished works about them, and the op\u00ad portunity Marquand gave to all his stu\u00ad dents to express their own theories. \"Even in his own field of the Delia Robbias,\" one of his former students recalled, \"he took the attitude that we knew as much about it as he, and in that way gave us a sort of professional cour\u00ad age.\" Outside of Princeton he was equally active and generous in promoting his chosen subject. He was one of the founders of the Archaeological Institute of America and of the American Journal of Archaeology. For some thirty years he anonymously financed traveling fel\u00ad lowships of the Institute and as chair\u00ad man of the Committee on Medieval and Renaissance Studies\u2014his own creation \u2014helped initiate the careers of a long line of students and teachers of the fine arts. He also supported the American School of Classical Studies in Rome at which he served a year as professor of archaeology. According to Professor Morey, his successor as chairman of the depart\u00ad ment, Marquand's work was achieved with no sacrifice of the quiet kind\u00ad liness which constantly marked his relations with others. 316 MATHEMATICS Lacking completely the aggressive force with which other creative spirits have gained their ends, Allan Marquand built unconsciously on the loyalty and devotion which he in\u00ad spired in all who worked in close con\u00ad tact with him. Like his favorite artist, Luca [della Robbia], he saw life simply and directly, and as some\u00ad thing which was ultimately sound and beautiful. This viewpoint, his work, and his influence, derive their common admirable character, in the last analysis, from the outstanding quality which is basic in every esti\u00ad mate of the man, and in every mem\u00ad ory his deeds and human contacts have left behind them: his utter and unconscious unselfishness. THE MARQUAND LIBRARY Professor Marquand began to build an outstanding art library for his own use early in his career. He transferred it from his house to the Campus in 1900, formally deeded it to the Univer\u00ad sity in 1908, and continued to add to it during his lifetime. It provides the nu\u00ad cleus of the library that has been devel\u00ad oped as a memorial to him and that is now considered one of the finest art li\u00ad braries in the world. MARQUAND PARK In 1887 Professor Marquand ac\u00ad quired an estate in the western section of town, which he renamed Guernsey Hall after the island home of his Huguenot ancestors. Here he and Mrs. Marquand, who was a recognized authority on flowers and trees in old paintings and manuscripts and an hon\u00ad orary Master of Arts of the University, frequently entertained faculty and stu\u00ad dents. In 1953 their children gave seven\u00ad teen acres of the estate to Princeton Borough for use as a park. It provides open playing fields and walks among handsome, old, and often rare, trees for the enjoyment of the people of Princeton. Mathematics has been prominent in the Princeton curriculum since the founding of the College. In 1760, enter\u00ad ing students were required to have an understanding of the rules of arithme\u00ad tic, and underclassmen learned al\u00ad gebra, trigonometry, geometry, and conic sections. In 1853 a Boston news\u00ad paper reported that at Princeton the study of mathematics was carried on \"to an extent not excelled by any other col\u00ad lege in the country.\" In the early years, instruction in mathematics was given by faculty members who generally taught other subjects as well. The first trained mathematician on the faculty was Walter M into, who had studied in Pisa and had taught in Edinburgh be\u00ad fore being called to Princeton in 1787. Not until a century later did the Col\u00ad lege again have on its faculty teachers who had studied in the European mathematical centers; the first was Henry Burchard Fine (A. B. Princeton 1880), who received his Ph.D. degree at Leipzig in 1885. The state of mathematics in Princeton changed dramatically after 1905; the beginning of the develop\u00ad ment of Princeton as one of the world's great centers of mathematical teaching and research took place that year, and was primarily due to Henry Burchard Fine. Fine had been appointed dean of the faculty by President Woodrow Wil\u00ad son in 1903; and when the University was organized into academic depart\u00ad ments in 1904 he was also appointed the first chairman of the Department of Mathematics. In 1905 Fine persuaded Wilson to extend the new preceptorial MATHEMATICS 317 system to include mathematics and to appoint as preceptors a very promising group of young mathematicians, includ\u00ad ing Luther P. Eisenhart, who had come to Princeton as an instructor in 1900 and became a distinguished differen\u00ad tial geometer, and Oswald Veblen, a geometer and later a mathematical statesman. Dean Fine's ability to detect mathematical talent is evidenced by even a partial list of other appointments he made to the Princeton faculty: James Jeans, Professor of Applied Mathe\u00ad matics, who shortly returned to Cam\u00ad bridge University; George David Birk- hoff, who later became the leading mathematical figure at Harvard; J. H. M. Wedderburn, an algebraist whose name is familiar to all mathe\u00ad maticians; James W. Alexander II (B. S. Princeton 1910, Ph.D. 1915), the to- pologist; and Solomon Lefschetz, and topologist. These appointments produced a math\u00ad ematics faculty of the first rank during the 1920s, and an atmosphere of fresh\u00ad ness and enthusiasm that lured a great many of the ablest young mathe\u00ad maticians to postgraduate study at Princeton as National Research Fel\u00ad lows. The publication of the Annals of Mathematics was taken over from Har\u00ad vard in 1911; and under the direction of Wedderburn and Lefschetz (succes\u00ad sively chief editors of that journal for over forty years) the Annals became one of the principal journals of research mathematics in the world. During this period, mathematics in Princeton, and indeed throughout the United States, was still under a severe handicap in comparison with mathe\u00ad matics in the great European centers. All of the mathematicians in this coun\u00ad try were primarily teachers; faculties were small, and the teaching loads, consisting mainly of rather routine courses, were heavy. In Europe by contrast there were forty or fifty posts that were essentially research profes\u00ad sorships of mathematics, with limited teaching duties and considerable pres\u00ad tige. The situation changed in 1928, when Princeton instituted the scientific research fund, which made possible a stream of distinguished visiting math\u00ad ematicians such as G. H. Hardy and P. A. M. Dirac of Cambridge and P. A. Alexandroff of Moscow. At that time too Princeton established the first re\u00ad search professorship in mathematics in the United States, the Henry Burchard Fine Professorship, a gift of Thomas D. Jones 1876. In addition, Jones and his niece Gwethalyn Jones endowed a memorial building to honor Dean Fine, who died in 1928. This building, dedi\u00ad cated in 1931, was commodious and el\u00ad egant, with handsome wood-panelled library, common rooms, and faculty studies; it housed the department in comfort and style for almost forty years, and Fine Hall became synonymous with the Princeton Department of Mathematics. Mathematical research in the United States was further advanced when the Institute for Advanced Study was founded in Princeton in 1930. Although the Institute and the University are separate institutions, they have had close and productive relations from the beginning. The School of Mathematics was the first branch of the Institute to be staffed in 1932, and had temporary quarters in Fine Hall until 1939. Two of the Institute's first five professors, Al\u00ad exander and Veblen, had been at the University for many years, John von Neumann had been professor of math\u00ad ematical physics since 1930, and Her\u00ad mann Weyl had been the Thomas D. Jones Professor of Mathematical Physics at Princeton in 1928-1929. 318 MATHEMATICS Only Einstein had never held a position at the University, although he had de\u00ad livered a series of lectures there on the theory of relativity in 1921. The Insti\u00ad tute joined the University in the publi\u00ad cation of the Annals of Mathematics, and in the founding of the Princeton Mathematics Series (1939) and the An\u00ad nals of Mathematics Studies (1940), both of which were originated and edited for many years by Albert W. Tucker and continue to be published by Princeton University Press. Under the chairmanship, from 1929 to 1945, of Fine's successor, Luther P. Eisenhart, the department continued to make outstanding appointments of promising young mathematicians, such as Alonzo Church, a noted logician; Eugene P. Wigner, Thomas D. Jones Professor of Mathematical Physics and later a Nobel laureate; Salomon Boch- ner, known for the breadth of his con\u00ad tributions to many different areas of analysis; and Samuel S. Wilks, a distin\u00ad guished mathematical statistician. With the permanent mathematical faculties and visiting members of the University and the Institute, Princeton became an intensely active center for mathe\u00ad matical research in the 1930s. Report\u00ad ing on an International Congress of Mathematicians held in Oslo in 1936, a Norwegian newspaper ran this head\u00ad line: \"Princeton is the mathematical center of the world but at the moment it is in Oslo.\" During the 1920s and 1930s Prince\u00ad ton's uniquely successful graduate pro\u00ad gram in mathematics also developed. For two decades after 1935, Princeton produced more Ph.D. degrees in mathematics than any other American university; and an American Mathe\u00ad matical Society study in 1974 showed that the Princeton graduate program is by far the largest producer of the tenured faculty members in the coun\u00ad try's leading mathematics depart\u00ad ments. The characteristic aspects of the Princeton Ph.D. program in mathe\u00ad matics are freedom from formal course requirements, an emphasis on original research at an early stage of the stu\u00ad dent's education, and a spirit of cooperative study and research in which the students and faculty partici\u00ad pate jointly. Political developments in Europe in the 1930s increased the flow of tal\u00ad ented refugees to the United States, and the University and the Institute helped to channel many mathe\u00ad maticians to positions in this country. This vast influx of talent altered the mathematical balance of the world, and finally raised American mathematics to the level of that of the older centers of research in Europe. The first postwar international gathering of mathe\u00ad maticians\u2014over a hundred leaders from nine nations\u2014took place in Fine Hall in 1946, as part of Princeton's bicentennial celebration. The greater amount of mathematical teaching and research required in the more tech\u00ad nologically oriented postwar world led to an increase in the size of the fac\u00ad ulty. Among those added to the faculty during Solomon Lefschetz's chairman\u00ad ship, from 1945 to 1953, were Ralph Fox and Norman Steenrod in topology; Emil Artin in algebra; John Tukey in statistics; Bargmann Arthur Wightman in mathematical physics; William Feller in probability; and Donald C. Spencer in analysis. Lefschetz was succeeded as chairman by Albert W. Tucker, who served from 1953 to 1963. Thereafter the character of the departmental administration changed to a more cooperative under\u00ad taking, with duties shared by almost THE MATHER SUN DIAL 319 the entire senior faculty; John W. MiI- nor, Gilbert A. Hunt, Elias M. Stein, William Browder, Joseph J. Kohn, and Robert C. Gunning served successive short terms as chairmen after 1963. Milnor (Princeton A.B. 1951, Ph.D. 1954, winner of the Madison medal, 1977), who had written his first pub\u00ad lished paper as a freshman, was pro\u00ad moted to full professor in 1960, the youngest in 50 years. He became a pro\u00ad fessor at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1969. His age record for pro\u00ad fessorial precocity was broken by Charles L. Fefferman (Princeton Ph.D. 1969), who became full professor of mathematics at the University of Chi\u00ad cago in 1971, and a year later, at the age of 23, was elected by the trustees to a professorship at Princeton, thus equal\u00ad ing a record set a century and a half ear\u00ad lier by another professor of mathemat\u00ad ics, John Maclean, later president of the College. These and other appointments during this period gave Princeton a strong faculty in topology (traditionally an area of excellence at Princeton), in algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry, in various branches of analysis (Fourier analysis, partial differ\u00ad ential equations, complex analysis, probability), and in mathematical physics (a unique interdepartmental program). During the 1950s and 1960s the heightened national interest in science and mathematics following Sputnik and the space program led to a further ex\u00ad pansion of the department. The number of graduate students increased considerably, with generous support through the National Science Founda\u00ad tion and Woodrow Wilson Foundation Fellowships; undergraduate majors in\u00ad creased from a handful to over two dozen each year; and by the mid-sixties the faculty had more than doubled since the war. Altogether, the depart\u00ad ment was nearly five times larger than when it had moved into Fine Hall in 1931, so that that elegant building was no longer large enough. A new build\u00ad ing, adjacent to the new physics build\u00ad ing, was erected in 1969 to house the Department of Mathematics and the new Department of Statistics, which had separated from the Mathematics Department in 1965 under the chair\u00ad manship of John W. Tukey. The new building, with a tower containing fac\u00ad ulty studies, a large underground li\u00ad brary, and extensive study areas, was a sharp contrast to the old building; but to mark fittingly the continuity of what had by now become the distinguished tradition of Princeton mathematics, the name Fine Hall was transferred to the new building, and the old one renamed Jones Hall in honor of the original donors. The Department has continued to flourish in its new quarters, and to uphold its reputation as a world center for teaching and research in mathe\u00ad matics. Robert C. Gunning Mather Sun Dial, The, in the court of McCosh Hall, is a replica of the his\u00ad toric Turnbull Sun Dial constructed in 1551 at Corpus Christi College, Ox\u00ad ford. It was given by Sir William Mather, governor of Victoria Univer\u00ad sity, Manchester, England, to \"symbol\u00ad ize the connection between Oxford and Princeton [and ] . . . Great Britain and America,\" and was unveiled on his be\u00ad half by Viscount James Bryce, then British ambassador to the United States, in 1907. The monumental shaft, rising from a broad base to a height of more than twenty feet, is topped by a pelican, religious symbol of Corpus Christi. Inscribed around the base are 320 DEAN MATHEY these words from Samuel Butler's Hudibras: Loyalty is e'er the same Whether it win or lose the game True as the dial to the sun Although it be not shined upon. Mathey, Dean '12 (1890-1972), who served as a trustee under Presidents Hibben, Dodds, and Goheen, was one of the most devoted, energetic, and generous supporters of the University in modern times. His association with Princeton covered a period of sixty-five years and included a wide acquaintance among trustees, faculty, and alumni. He first came to Princeton in 1907 to play in the University's annual in- terscholastic tennis tournament, which he won. In his book of Princeton remi\u00ad niscences, Men and Gothic Towers, he recalled the \"lovely starlit early May evening\" when, as an overnight guest of an upperclassman in Blair Hall, he heard the seniors singing on the steps of Nassau Hall, and was stirred by the program, \"a medley of sentiment, humor, loyalty to Alma Mater and the nation.\" He was also inspired by the beauty of the Gothic buildings, by \"Blair Arch with its spectacular steps, the clock in the tower.\" The next summer, in 1908, he won the national interscholastic tennis championship at Newport, Rhode Is\u00ad land, and that fall he entered Prince\u00ad ton. He twice won the national intercol\u00ad legiate doubles championship\u2014in 1910 with a classmate, Burnham N. Dell; in 1911 with another classmate, Charles T. Butler\u2014and was captain of the Uni\u00ad versity tennis team in his senior year. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and graduated with honors. He also \"had the good fortune\" to hear Woodrow Wilson lecture in his popular course in jurisprudence a short time before Wil\u00ad son left Princeton to run for governor of New Jersey in the fall of 1910, and was Wilson's great admirer, \"as was the en\u00ad tire student body.\" In 1912, he cast his first presidential vote for Wilson and for many years thereafter liked to identify himself as a \"Woodrow Wilson Demo\u00ad crat,\" which, to his amusement, per\u00ad plexed some of his Republican as\u00ad sociates on Wall Street. Later, as a trus\u00ad tee, he headed the campaign that raised funds for an increased endow\u00ad ment for the School of Public and International Affairs as a memorial to Wilson. On graduation, Mathey started to work as a bond salesman, at $15 a week, for William A. Read & Co. and eventu\u00ad ally became a partner of its successor, Dillon, Read & Co. He found Wall Street a satisfying outlet for his com\u00ad petitive spirit and gradually built up a sizable fortune. He came to live in Princeton in 1927 in an old farmhouse that he had re\u00ad modeled with the help of his architect classmate Arthur Holden, on property he had bought from the estate of Moses Taylor Pyne (q.v.). Here he gave luncheons for classmates on Reunion Saturdays and for University trustees and officers on Baccalaureate Sundays and entertained University guests when need arose. He was alumni trustee of the Univer\u00ad sity from 1927 to 1931, charter trustee from 1931 to I960, trustee emeritus from 1960 until his death; he served at various times on every one of the board's nine standing committees. His twelve years as chairman of the finance committee, 1949 to 1960, and of its subcommittee on investments, were marked by a sixfold increase in the University's budget and a doubling in value of its investment pool. He was DEAN MATHEY 321 fond of saying, if asked about some at\u00ad tractive investment his committee may have overlooked, \"Well, you can't kiss all the pretty girls,\" but, as one of his associates said, \"Mathey didn't miss many of them.\" His greatest love was the committee on grounds and buildings, on which he served for thirty-four years and of which he was chairman from 1942 to 1949. \"He gave countless hours to every phase of the committee's work,\" President Goheen said, \"from the small\u00ad est details to the largest matters of pol\u00ad icy, with unfailing concern for the pres\u00ad ervation of the beauty and, in his words, 'the human feel' of the Princeton campus.\" Mathey's love of architectural niceties, his affection for his family and friends, and his regard for the traditions of the place can be seen here and there across the campus. He conceived of the Henry B. Thompson Memorial Court within the East Pyne Building. With Mrs. Harold W. Dodds, he planned the garden in memory of President Hibben and the bench in memory of Beatrix Farrand (q.v.) on the north side of the chapel. He gave the Dean Samuel Wi- nans wall enclosing the rear garden of the John Maclean House, in memory of his father-in-law, and the Gertrude Winans Mathey faculty housing near the Graduate College, in memory of his first wife. He proposed, and with another Princeton tennis captain, Joseph L. Werner '21, was co-donor of the pavilion between the rows of tennis courts on Brokaw Field. When his classmate Sanford B. White, a legend\u00ad ary athlete of their college days, died in 1964, Mathey led the Class of 1912 in providing in White's memory another pavilion which stands in the midst of the Bedford, Gulick, and Pardee play\u00ad ing fields. In 1933 he served on the committee appointed to wait on Harold W. Dodds to notify him of his election as presi\u00ad dent, and in 1957 on the committee that recommended Robert F. Goheen's election as president. Mathey held that the trustees of a university cannot delegate their re\u00ad sponsibilities but that they can and should delegate to the president the au\u00ad thority vested in them by charter. \"They though there may be differ\u00ad ences between members of the board and even the whole board of trustees about minor policies from time to time, they should back up their president in his over-all educational policies and [defend him] from the heckling of chronic alumni gripers who think the old place is going to the dogs.\" As a trustee Mathey practiced what he preached, supporting the University with an open-minded concern and a large generosity. Perhaps his most consistently felt\u2014and generously shown\u2014in\u00ad terest [President Goheen faculty housing. . . . How much he did by generous gift, as well as by wise judgment, in this area of the University's needs, is little known, for he preferred not to take the credit; but I can tell you it was very large. And this is a clue to the personality of Dean Mathey\u2014so cheerful and outspoken in everything\u2014and all the while modestly concealing his own role. The full extent of his many gra\u00ad cious and generous thoughts and acts on behalf of Princeton and Princetonians was probably not fully understood by anyone\u2014perhaps not even by himself. 322 WALTER MINTO . . . Financier he was, overseer of buildings and grounds he was, but he always placed the human concern ahead of all others. Liveliness and warmth went with keen intelligence and shrewd judgment. Dean liked people. Mathey never revealed to anyone the extent of his benefactions to the Uni\u00ad versity, but he did disclose the philoso\u00ad phy behind them in an essay he wrote for the Class of 1912's Fifty Year Re\u00ad cord: \"Why do we, along with the alumni. . . of our sister colleges, return to our campuses with a certain solemnity\u2014even though it be on joyous occasions such as a reunion or a tradi\u00ad tional football game?\" he asked his classmates. \"And why do so many of us so often lay so much of our treasure at our Alma Mater's feet?\" I believe the causes of this loyalty to our private colleges [he wrote] . . . go back to the first law of nature, namely survival. For, it seems to me, we sense how fleeting all things are, not only the things we build with our hands, but life itself and even our posterity. And along with this we also sense, subconsciously perhaps, that the great seats of learning . . . some established as far back as the eleventh century\u2014have withstood the ravages of time better than any other thing to which we ourselves may contribute. Minto, Walter (1753-1796), one of Princeton's earliest teachers of mathe\u00ad matics, was perhaps the first deserving the designation \"mathematician.\" Born in Scotland, in a family of Spanish ori\u00ad gin, he read in theology at Edinburgh, and after studying mathematics and as\u00ad tronomy in Pisa, became a professor of mathematics at the University of Edin\u00adburgh. In 1783 he published a treatise on the recently discovered planet Uranus, which contained mathematical formulas for determining astronomical magnitudes; and in 1787 he collabo\u00ad rated on a biography of John Napier, the Scottish inventor of logarithms. A warm supporter of the cause of American independence, Minto came to America in 1786. He spent a year as principal of Erasmus Hall, a newly founded boys school at Flatbush, Long Island, and in 1787 accepted a call to Princeton as professor of mathematics and natural philosophy at a salary of \u00a3200 a year plus room and board. Minto was successful as a teacher and well regarded by the College au\u00ad thorities. When he died at the age of forty-two, he had been treasurer of the College and clerk of the Board of Trus\u00ad tees for a year, and had almost com\u00ad pleted the manuscript for a book on mathematics. Minto's inaugural oration, delivered on Commencement eve in 1788, and printed by Isaac Collins of Trenton, contains an account of the progress of mathematical science up to that time and a persuasive statement of its impor\u00ad tance as an intellectual discipline (\"there is no occupation so well adapted . . . to brighten and enlarge that reason\u00ad ing power which forms the most distin\u00ad guishing feature of man . . .\"). The ora\u00ad tion also reveals, in its concluding prayer, Minto's love of liberty as well as of reason, and his faith in their place in his adopted land: Father of truth and reason and of every thing that lives! Be pleased to prosper the interests of science and literature in the United States of America: to make those interests ever subservient to the promotion of liberty, happiness, and virtue . . . to CHARLES RUFUS MOREY 323 protect this country as a secure and happy asylum to the oppressed in all quarters of the globe . . . to cause truth and reason at length to obtain a glorious and everlasting victory over error and violence. . . . Moffett Laboratory, which adjoins the eastern wing of Guyot Hall, was built in 1960 to provide additional space for the Department of Biology. Its cost was de\u00ad frayed jointly by the Whitehall Founda\u00ad tion and the National Institutes of Health, and it was named for George M. Moffett '04, founder of the Whitehall Foundation and donor in 1952 of the Moffett Professorship of Biology. In addition to teaching laboratories and offices, Moffett Laboratory contains radioisotope laboratories and many types of specialized equipment for the study of physiological and biochemical processes, greenhouse space and plant growth chambers for the study of plant development, and a variety of different temperature-controlled rooms for studies on a wide range of biological phenomena. Morey, Charles Rufus (1877-1955), chairman of the Department of Art and Archaeology from 1924 to 1945, was a scholar who reminded some people of a prosperous banker, others (as one col\u00ad league put it) of a good bishop \"re\u00ad spected by the mighty and loved by the poor.\" With his A.B. and A.M. from the University of Michigan and three years' experience as Fellow of the American School of Classical Studies in Rome, Morey came to Princeton in 1903 as a fellow in classics. Three years later, he accepted the invitation of Allan Mar- quand (q.v.) to become a Wilson- appointed preceptor in art history. In his thirty-nine years in the depart\u00ad ment, Morey not only helped establish the budding discipline as a respected field of learning but, as Professor Erwin Panofsky has pointed out, was one of those responsible for the fact \"that the contribution of American scholarship has left its imprint on the history of art all over the world.\" His books, Early Christian Art and Medieval Art, both published in 1942, rank at the top of his voluminous bibliography. One critic thought that in Early Christian Art \"Morey alone provided a theory com\u00ad prehensive enough to guide research,\" and found his \"union of theoretical breadth and minute observation of par\u00ad ticulars . . . extremely rare in English writing on art.\" Morey taught renaissance and mod\u00ad ern art as well as his specialities, prac\u00ad ticing his own precept that his faculty should be knowledgeable in all fields. Demanding much of co-workers, he gave much. When called to another university, his price to Princeton for re\u00ad fusing was a sabbatical every seventh semester for his faculty to study abroad. He increased endowment for his de\u00ad partment by \"soaking the rich,\" appar\u00ad ently with their cordial approval. In his publications grateful acknowledgement of his graduate students' research built their self-confidence and pleasure in their work (exuberantly expressed by them in a hymnal parody: \"He cited me . . . His faithful slave I'll ever be. For in his book he cited me.\") His faith in his younger faculty led to long lists of rec\u00ad ommended promotions which, it is said, once caused the dean of the fac\u00ad ulty, Robert K. Root, to exclaim: \"ALL Rufus's ducklings are swans!\" Ambition for his department never limited his concern for the University, for art history, or for humanism in gen\u00ad eral. He was an active, at times formid-324 CHARLES RUFUS MOREY able, participant in faculty meetings. In 1932 he distributed at one meeting a booklet printed at his expense, A laboratory-Library, describing \"a workplace for students as well as teachers rather than a storehouse for books.\" Thus he planted the seed for some unique and widely copied fea\u00ad tures of Firestone Library, built fifteen years later to serve the University gen\u00ad erally in ways that the Marquand Li\u00ad brary had so well served art historians. Similarly he helped develop New York University's Institute of Fine Arts and the Institute for Advanced Study's School of Humanities, endeavors cited by Panofsky as evidence that Morey \"could not prevent the force of his per\u00ad sonality from acting upon his surround\u00ad ings much as the force of gravity oper\u00ad ates in the physical world.\" There were numerous other manifes\u00ad tations of this force. Morey originated the Index of Christian Art (q.v.) in 1917 and later initiated and directed the Vat\u00ad ican's catalogue of Christian art. For seven years he guided a consortium of five institutions (including Princeton) in a joint excavation of Antioch, and he supervised the ensuing publications. He helped found and nurture the Col\u00ad lege Art Association and its publication, The Art Bulletin. Finally there were the five years (1945-1950) he spent as Cultural Affairs Officer at the United States Embassy in Rome. During his tour of duty in Rome, he was credited with healing more war wounds than would have been possible for a professional diplomat. Using army trucks and naval vessels, he reopened the flow of journals, books, and photo\u00ad graphs between Italy and America be\u00ad fore the usual postal channels were operating. Aided by former students, some still in uniform, he located and restored to Italy paintings, sculptures, even whole libraries, which the Nazis had removed. He drew Roman ar\u00ad chaeological and historical institutions into a union that helped their depleted staffs become effective once again. In spite of great difficulties, he even met the Metropolitan Museum's request for a loan of two statues (one a Michelangelo) for its Diamond Jubilee. Finding Lloyd's premiums exorbitant, Morey resolutely shipped the precious packages uninsured, commandeering a fleet of MP's on motorcycles and the battleship Missouri for their transporta\u00ad tion. This was the same man who, lectur\u00ad ing one night at the Morgan Library, became so absorbed in a hitherto un\u00ad noticed detail of one of his slides that he ceased talking until the director sent up a note inviting him \"to share his thoughts with his audience.\" His style\u2014in thought, action, and personal relations\u2014was total involvement. As a teacher, one of his strongest motivating influences was his obvious distress when students failed, his real delight when they succeeded. In soliciting con\u00ad tributions to his projects he responded genuinely to the interests of others (even to the point of admiring one prospect's dog, which had just bitten him) before drawing them toward his own concerns. Panofsky spoke for many when, in commenting on Professor Morey's fun\u00ad damental goodness and strength of character, he wrote: No one can number those who . . . owed to him their place in the world, their scale of values, their sense of direction in life. No one who knew him can forget the brief, warm smile that could suddenly illumine his JAMES ORMSBEE MURRAY 325 strong, often stern-looking face and give confidence to the timid and courage to the troubled. Martha Lou Stohlman Mudd, Seeley G., Manuscript Library is named for the dean of the University of Southern California School of Medi\u00ad cine whose will established a $44 mil\u00ad lion fund for American university and college buildings. The trustees of this fund made a grant of $1,125,000 to Princeton toward the $2,500,000 needed for a manuscript library; the balance was contributed by other donors. The Mudd Library houses the per\u00ad sonal papers of Bernard Baruch, James Forrestal '15, John M. Harlan '20, David E. Lilienthal, Adlai E. Steven\u00ad son '22, and other twentieth-century public figures. Located here also are the University Archives. Situated on Olden Street opposite the Engineering Quadrangle, the three-story library contains two levels of stacks for the storage of both bound and boxed pa\u00ad pers, office space for visiting scholars, a reading room, conference room, and visitors' lounge, in addition to the usual office and work space for library staff. The building, which was completed in 1976, was designed by Hugh Stubbins and Associates of Cambridge, Mas\u00ad sachusetts. Munro, Dana Carleton (1866-1933), first Dodge Professor of History, graduated from Brown University in 1887 and, soon after, studied in Ger\u00ad many, where he acquired what became a life-long interest in the Crusades. He died before completing his magnum opus\u2014a history of the Crusades based on exhaustive and critical use of con\u00adtemporary sources, and on field work in the Near East; but he published five other books that testify to his learning and industry. One of these, The Middle Ages, first published in 1902, went through several revised editions and was known to generations of college students. Munro's students admired him for his profound knowledge and for the generous way he shared his learning. Many leading medieval historians were trained in his graduate seminars; a group of them wrote The Crusades and Other Essays, published in his honor in 1928. As chairman of the history depart\u00ad ment from 1916 to 1928, he built up the faculty, raised teaching standards, and stimulated research by his own exam\u00ad ple and counsel. Munro's geniality and capacity for making friends, coupled with his wide intellectual interests, made him a leader in many scholarly organizations. He was president of the American Histori\u00ad cal Association, managing editor of the American Historical Review, and active in the affairs of the American Philo\u00ad sophical Society. He was chosen as chairman of the advisory board of the American Council of Learned Societies when that organization was formed in 1928, and was elected president of the Medieval Academy in 1930. He served in both capacities until his death in 1933. Murray, James Ormsbee (1827-1899), a graduate of Brown University and Andover Theological Seminary, was Holmes Professor of Belles Lettres from 1875 to 1899 and dean of the fac\u00ad ulty from 1883 to 1899. He was Princeton's first dean. \"The office was at first a difficult 326 MURRAY-DODGE HALL one,\" Professor George McLean Harper later noted in a biographical sketch, \"for it included discipline and the enforcement of standards of scholarship, but Dean Murray soon ob\u00ad tained general good will without sac\u00ad rificing just severity. He had an en\u00ad thusiastic, impulsive, and affectionate disposition.\" This judgment of a junior colleague corroborated the opinion of a senior one. \"For sixteen years,\" President McCosh reflected at the time of his re\u00ad tirement in 1888, \"I had the somewhat invidious task of looking after the mor\u00ad als and discipline of the College. Since that time this important work has been committed to Dean Murray, who has shown more patience than I did in the discharge of his duties. Parents may be satisfied when they know that he is looking after the best welfare of their sons.\" On Dean Murray's death in 1899, alumni gave funds for a professorship of English in his memory. Dean Murray's son, George R. Mur\u00ad ray, who graduated from the College in 1893, was general athletic treasurer from 1900 to 1932. Murray-Dodge Hall consists of two buildings, joined by a cloister, each a memorial to a Princetonian who died young. Murray Hall was built in 1879 with a bequest left by Hamilton Murray 1872, who went down with the S.S. Ville de Havre when it sank in mid- ocean on November 22, 1873; he had written his will the night before he sailed. Dodge Hall was built in 1900 in memory of Earl Dodge 1879 (a former president of the student religious or\u00ad ganization, the Philadelphian Society) who died five years after graduation, in 1884. The funds were given by his father William Earl Dodge, Jr., and his brother Cleveland H. Dodge 1879. Both buildings were originally used by the Philadelphian Society. Dodge Hall continues to be a center for religious ac\u00ad tivities, housing the offices of the dean and assistant dean of the chapel, the denominational chaplains, and various student religious and social service or\u00ad ganizations. Murray Hall, once used for weekday chapel services, has since the 1920s been the home of Theatre In- time. Music, Department of. Although mu\u00ad sic is a late-comer to the University's curriculum (Yale Congregationalists have attributed this to the severities of Presbyterianism) it has nevertheless held an important place in Princeton life since the early days of the College. President Davies wrote odes to \"Peace\" and \"Science,\" which were sung by students at Commencement in 1760; and when President Witherspoon was married in 1791, a student orchestra celebrated the event with music from the belfry of Nassau Hall. Student sing\u00ad ing has long been a prominent feature of campus life, whether in the Glee Club, founded in 1874, or in step- singing, in vogue since the 1880s. An approach to a more formal pro\u00ad gram came in 1917 when Henry C. Frick donated the great organ in the Graduate College's Procter Hall, and Alexander Russell, appointed part-time organist and director of music, began weekly organ recitals and public lec\u00ad tures on music. Ralph Downes, first or\u00ad ganist and choirmaster in the Univer\u00ad sity Chapel, dedicated in 1928, also taught several music courses for under\u00ad graduates. The work of Russell and Downes was supplemented by a com\u00ad mittee, made up principally of faculty DEPARTMENT OF MUSIC 327 wives, which organized the Universi\u00ad ty's public concert series. In 1934, on recommendation of a faculty committee, Roy Dickinson Welch, Professor of Music at Smith College, was invited to Princeton to give two undergraduate courses in music and to design a future plan of study. Student response to Welch's of\u00ad ferings was so enthusiastic that he was prevailed upon to stay and to build the music program himself, thus becoming the father of the Music Department at Princeton. Welch's embryonic program was in\u00ad corporated within the Department of Art and Archaeology as a Section of Music. Growth was rapid. By 1937 the two experimental courses had in\u00ad creased to seven and the original thirty-five students had grown so that one tenth of the student body was tak\u00ad ing at least one music course sometime in their college career. The enlarged curriculum allowed undergraduates to begin concentrating in the theory and history of music. Welch made several distinguished appointments for the future\u2014Roger Sessions in theory and composition, Oliver Strunk in history and literature, and in 1940 a one-year M.F.A. program was begun. Several new instructors were appointed, in\u00ad cluding: Milton Babbitt and Edward Cone, two of the department's earliest M.F.A.'s, and Merrill Knapp. The lat\u00ad ter was Glee Club director as well as teacher, as, later, Elliot Forbes was for eleven years before he left to return in 1958 to his alma mater, Harvard. The phenomenal progress of the early years occurred despite the fact that there was very little money and no building. Instruction was given in the basement of Alexander Hall, the Peking Room of Murray-Dodge (shared with Theatre Intime), and the crypt of the Chapel. Books and scores were stored in McCormick Hall, and practice facilities were virtually non-existent. In 1946 the music section attained departmental status and shortly there\u00ad after was given Clio Hall for a home. Although Clio was not ideal (Stravinsky in the basement often collided with Bach on the second floor via the heating pipes\u2014a wondrous conduit for sound), music was finally under one roof and began to flourish. The graduate pro\u00ad gram was extended to include the award of Ph.D.s; the first one was con\u00ad ferred in 1950. The Record Lending Library (soon to possess some 8000 re\u00ad cordings) became popular among un\u00ad dergraduates and faculty, and concert activities expanded greatly. The neces\u00ad sary support was provided by Paul Bed\u00ad ford 1897 department's perennial Wil\u00ad liam R. McAlpin '26, and many other of the Friends of Music. In 1951 the department suffered a grievous loss in the early death of its founder, Roy Dickinson Welch. In a moving tribute the faculty praised him as a brilliant teacher and able adminis\u00ad trator and as one whose life illustrated the truth of his own belief that \"music offers infinite capacity for infinite self- renewal.\" Arthur Mendel, an authority on the music of Bach who was called to Princeton in 1952, brought the de\u00ad partment professional recognition and eminence during his fifteen years as chairman. Mendel's own scholarship and teaching led in the development of excellence particularly in the graduate program. He was strongly supported by the eminent American composer Roger Sessions, who returned in 1953, after an eight-year absence in Berkeley, as 328 THE NASSAU CLUB first incumbent of the Conant chair in music, and by Oliver Strunk, one of the nation's leading musicologists. Almost as important was the influ\u00ad ence these men exerted on younger col\u00ad leagues who were to take their places. In theory and composition, Milton Babbitt became widely known as a con\u00ad temporary theorist and composer; Ed\u00ad ward Cone, as composer, pianist, and writer on musical structure and form; Earl Kim, as composer and performer; James K. Randall, as composer of elec\u00ad tronic music; Peter Westergaard, as composer and teacher of theory. This group helped found Perspectives of New Music, a leading periodical in the field. In musicology, Merrill Knapp (Han\u00ad del and the English eighteenth cen\u00ad tury), Kenneth Levy (Byzantine and medieval music), Lewis Lockwood (Renaissance studies and Beethoven), have all published widely in their re\u00ad spective fields. Carl Weinrich, organist and choir\u00ad master in the University Chapel for thirty years, brought renown to Princeton by his organ recitals and re\u00ad cordings of Bach. He was also Glee Club director from 1952 to 1958, when Walter Nollner took over. Nollner proved markedly successful in this posi\u00ad tion, and in 1973 succeeded Weinrich as choirmaster as well. After years of careful planning, Ar\u00ad thur Mendel brought the department into the Woolworth Center of Musical Studies\u2014more soundproof than Clio!\u2014 in the fall of 1963. During the late 1960s and 1970s, when Kenneth Levy, Lewis Lockwood, and Peter Wester\u00ad gaard were chairmen, the department continued to progress and expand, par\u00ad ticularly after the advent of coeduca\u00ad tion. Practical music-making, student concerts, and demand for practice space filled Woolworth to overflowing only ten years after its completion, and the abundance and frequency of musi\u00ad cal notices in the Weekly Bulletin showed how pervasive music had be\u00ad come in the life of the campus. Appointments of Claudio Spies (composer and authority on Stravinsky) and Harold Powers (ethno-musicologist and opera scholar) in the early 1970s further strengthened the department. As of 1972, Princeton's graduate pro\u00ad gram in music was rated as one of the best in the country. J. Merrill Knapp Nassau Club, The, was organized in 1889 to advance the social life of its members, who were drawn from both town and gown. It acquired its present clubhouse at 6 Mercer Street in 1903 when Woodrow Wilson was its presi\u00ad dent. The house had been built about 1814 for Professor Samuel Miller of the Theological Seminary. Two of the Club's most famous parties were those it gave for ex-President Cleveland when he came here to live and for Pro\u00ad fessor Bliss Perry when he left Princeton to become editor of the At\u00ad lantic Monthly. The Club's best known activity in modern times has been its weekly Wednesday luncheon talks, which have been drawing on the com\u00ad munity's rich resources for the edi\u00ad fication of its members since 1914. Originally, the Club had thirty-two members; by 1977 the number was approaching 1900\u2014nearly 800 resident and 1100 nonresident mem\u00ad bers, most of the latter alumni of the University. Nassau Hall was, at the time of its completion in 1756, the largest stone building in the colonies. It was much NASSAU HALL 329 admired and provided the inspiration for other college buildings, notably Hollis Hall at Harvard, University Hall at Brown, Dartmouth Hall at Dartmouth, and Queens Hall at Rut\u00ad gers. \"We do everything in the plainest and cheapest manner, as far as is consis\u00ad tent with Decency and Convenience, having no superfluous Ornaments,\" President Aaron Burr, Sr., wrote a ben\u00ad efactor in Scotland, and this was the guiding principle in the design of Nassau Hall. The trustee minutes men\u00ad tion a plan by William Worth, a local stonemason, and another plan by Dr. William Shippen of Philadelphia and Robert Smith, a carpenter-architect who later designed Carpenters Hall in Philadelphia. No doubt Dr. Shippen contributed to the design of the build\u00ad ing, as William Worth may have done in addition to the considerable contri\u00ad bution he made to its execution, but the major responsibility must have been Smith's, since an account of the College published by the trustees in 1765 declared that Nassau Hall was \"designed and executed by that ap\u00ad proved architect, Mr. Robert Smith, of Philadelphia.\" The trustees originally voted that \"the College be built of Brick if good Brick can be made at Princeton and if sand can be got reasonably cheap,\" but they later changed their plans and \"the College\" was built of a light brown sandstone from a nearby quarry. That it was good stone and that it was well and truly laid by William Worth, the ma\u00ad son, is substantiated by the fact that the exterior walls, which were twenty-six inches thick, withstood the extraordi\u00ad nary shocks and strains the building had to endure: the depredations it suf\u00ad fered during two years of military occu\u00ad pation in the Revolution, devastating fires in 1802 and 1855, and disturb\u00ad ances of rebellious students, who on one occasion exploded a hollow log charged with two pounds of gunpowder inside the main entrance, cracking the adjacent interior walls from top to bot\u00ad tom. It took two years to erect this build\u00ad ing and even before it was completed the trustees voted to name it for the governor of the Province, Jonathan Belcher (q.v.), who staunchly be\u00ad friended the College in many ways. \"Let BELCHER HALL proclaim your beneficent acts . . . to the latest ages,\" they wrote the governor, but, \"with a rare modesty,\" as President Maclean later noted, the governor declined the honor, and at his suggestion the build\u00ad ing was named Nassau Hall in memory of \"the Glorious King William the Third who was a Branch of the Illustri\u00ad ous House of Nassau.\" SMITH'S NASSAU HALL Smith's Nassau Hall had three stories and a basement. It was about 176 feet long and 54 feet wide at the ends, with a central element projecting about four feet in front and about twelve feet in back. Over the center of the hip roof was a modest cupola. There were three entrances at the front of the building and two at the back. On each of the three floors, a central corridor ran the whole length of the building east to west and all the rooms opened on these corridors. There was a two-story prayer hall, 32 by 40 feet, at the rear of the central projection, and a library on the second floor above the main entrance hall. On the three main floors were 42 chambers, some used for classes and for tutors, most of them for student lodging. In the basement were the kitchen, dining room, steward's 330 NASSAU HALL quarters, and, after 1762, additional rooms for students. Nassau Hall suffered severely in the Revolution. British and American troops quartered there at different times plundered the library, ruined the organ in the prayer hall, used furniture and woodwork for fuel. In the Battle of Princeton, Nassau HaII changed hands three times and once when the British were in possession, felt the effects of Washington's artillery. One American cannonball came through a window of the prayer hall, destroying a portrait of George II, and another hit the south wall of the west wing and left a scar that is visible today. Funds being in short supply, re\u00ad covery was slow; yet by 1783 Nassau Hall was ready to serve as the national capital. For four months that year, July through October, the Continental Congress met in the library on the second floor, using the prayer hall for state occasions. Here Congress con\u00ad gratulated George Washington on his successful termination of the war, re\u00ad ceived the news of the signing of the definitive treaty of peace with Great Britain, and welcomed the first foreign minister\u2014from the Netherlands\u2014ac\u00ad credited to the United States. At this time, Washington complied with a request of the trustees to sit for a portrait by Charles Willson Peale, which, at their direction, was placed in the prayer hall in the frame that had been occupied by the portrait of King George II. LATROBE'S RECONSTRUCTION The fire of 1802 left only the outside walls of Nassau Hall standing. To re\u00ad store the building the trustees called on Joseph Henry Latrobe, the first profes\u00ad sional architect in America, who later worked on the restoration of the na\u00adtional capital after it was burned in 1814. The changes Latrobe made in Smith's original design were chiefly practical ones to lessen the hazards of fire. Instead of wood, the floors were laid with brick and the stairs rebuilt of stone with iron railings. The building was given a sheet-iron roof-\u2014a new idea in this country and an experiment on the part of Latrobe. The roof was raised about two feet from its former position to allow space for transom lights over the doors; this improved the whole exterior ap\u00ad pearance of the building. The horizon\u00ad tal lintels over the three entrances at the front of the building were replaced by triangular pediments, and the circu\u00ad lar window in the central pediment ris\u00ad ing from the eaves line was replaced by a fan-light. The belfry was raised on a large square base to accommodate a clock and to give the cupola added height. Latrobe's changes gave Nassau Hall a Federal rather than a Colonial style, adding grace without marring the original simplicity. NOTMAN'S REMODELING The fire of 1855 was just as disastrous as the fire of 1802, and once more only the walls of Nassau Hall were left stand\u00ad ing. Again the trustees called on a Philadelphia architect, this time John Notman, who had designed three resi\u00ad dences in the village (\"Prospect\" and those later named Lowrie House and Guernsey Hall). Notman's modifi\u00ad cations were far more extensive than Latrobe's and reflected his predeliction for the Italian Rennaissance style, then much in vogue. Interior changes again were chiefly concerned with fireproofing. Iron beams and brick arches were used to support the floors. The roof was made NASSAU HALL 331 of slate, laid upon and fastened to iron- laths. Most important of all, since the 1855 fire was believed to have been caused by a spark from a stove in a stu\u00ad dent's room, nine furnaces were in\u00ad stalled to provide central heating. The old prayer hall, no longer needed for that purpose since the erection of a separate chapel, was extended further southward to more than twice its previ\u00ad ous size for use as the College library. Notman made even greater changes in the exterior appearance. Two of the three entrances at the front of the building were removed and towers built on either end to house the stair\u00ad ways which were removed from inte\u00ad rior halls. The doorway at the center of the building was replaced by a larger, arched doorway of Florentine style with more massive steps below and a simi\u00ad larly arched window, with a balcony, above. The vertical emphasis thus achieved culminated in a cupola even loftier than Latrobe's. The tops of the Italianate towers housing the staircases on either end of the building, which rose high above the roof line, were removed in 1905. LATER CHANGES The use of Nassau Hall as a dormi\u00ad tory declined steadily toward the end of the nineteenth century with the erec\u00ad tion of new dormitories, and as stu\u00ad dents moved out, museums, labora\u00ad tories, and classrooms moved in. In the east wing, part of the third floor was removed to create a two-story well for a natural history museum and a skylight cut in the roof to provide light. With construction of Palmer Laboratory and Guyot Hall these facilities were no longer needed, and in 1911, Nassau Hall began to be used for administra\u00ad tive offices; President Hibben (1912- 1932) was the first president to have his office there. By 1924, when Eno Hall was completed and the Department of Psychology had departed, Nassau Hall was devoted entirely to offices of the central administration. In 1967 additional space was ob\u00ad tained by flooring over the two-story well in the east wing, and the exterior appearance improved by the removal of the skylight above it. THE BELL A bell rang from the cupola of Nassau Hall soon after its completion. Made in England, it had to be recast after the fire of 1802 and was completely melted in the fire of 1855. A second bell cast in West Troy, New York, was hung in the cupola in 1858.It struck the hour and called students to classes and chapel for ninety-seven years. In time it devel\u00ad oped a slight crack and by 11:30 a.m. on February 18, 1955, its peal was re\u00ad duced to what the Alumni Weekly called \"a plaintive croak.\" Thanks to the generosity and foresight of Charles D. Hart 1892, a new bell, which had been cast in France under the direction of the University Bellmaster, Arthur Bigelow, was waiting in the wings. It was hoisted into place on February 22 and the following day at 9:00 p.m. rang out the hour in a D tone, a half note lower than that sounded by the earlier bell. For many years, the Nassau Hall bell was rung with a rope pulled by a cam\u00ad pus policeman or, in the hour-long ringing after a football victory in New Haven or Cambridge, by freshmen and, at least on one occasion, by a dean, whose signature, Christian Gauss, ap\u00ad peared on the wall among the other bell ringers'. With the electrification of bell ringing in 1962, visits to the third floor bell rope by policemen, freshmen, and deans came to an end. 332 NASSAU HALL Another custom, which persisted for almost a century, began in the 1860s when an undergraduate disrupted the College's schedule by removing the clapper from the bell one dark winter's night. In later years the stealing of the clapper lost some of its excitement as the College authorities became re\u00ad signed to the custom, and the Grounds and Buildings Department kept a bar\u00ad rel of clappers on hand to assure rapid replacement. Clinton Meneely '30, president of the family company which made the 1857 bell, said his firm re\u00ad ceived more orders for clappers for the Princeton bell than for any other bell in the firm's history. THE CLOCK A tower clock was first installed sometime after Latrobe's restoration of 1802 when the cupola was raised; it was probably destroyed in the fire of 1855. The clock with the four faces one sees today was donated by the Class of 1866 at the tenth anniversary of their gradua\u00ad tion. The works of this clock were mod\u00ad ernized in 1919 and again in 1955; its faces are periodically regilded to offset weathering. THE FACULTY ROOM In Norman's rebuilding after the fire of 1855, the former prayer hall was more than doubled in size for use as the College library and portrait gallery. After the completion of Chancellor Green Library in 1873, this room was used for the College museum until 1906 when it was remodeled by Messrs. Day and Klauder as the pres\u00ad ent Faculty Room. The cost was de\u00ad frayed by a bequest from Augustus S. Van Wickle, a descendant of Nathaniel FitzRandolph, who gave the land on which Nassau Hall was built; Van Wick- le's bequest also provided the FitzRan\u00addolph Gateway. When the Faculty Room was formally opened on Novem\u00ad ber 2, 1906, President Wilson, in ac\u00ad cepting the bequest on behalf of the trustees, said \"there could be no more appropriate gift from a descendant of Nathaniel FitzRandolph than one which touched with added beauty his original gift.\" Peale's portrait of Washington still hangs in the place of honor in this room along with replacements of the portrait of King George II, damaged in the Bat\u00ad tle of Princeton, and of Governor Belcher, lost probably in one of the fires. Now they are accompanied by a portrait of William III, Prince of Nassau, as well as portraits of all of Princeton's presidents and some of its illustrious early graduates. THE TIGERS The bronze tigers on either side of the front steps were presented in 1911 by Woodrow Wilson's classmates to re\u00ad place the lions that they had given on their graduation in 1879. The lions were beginning to show the effects weather and the tiger had become es\u00ad tablished as the symbol of Princeton. The tigers were modeled by A. P. Proc\u00ad tor, noted for his animal sculptures. Recumbent, with a \"placidity suiting their decorative purpose\" (as one critic put it), they have invited generations of small boys and girls to climb up on their backs. MEMORIAL HALL The entrance hall, remodeled in 1919 by Day and Klauder as a war memorial, bears on its marble walls the names of Princetonians who have died in this country's wars: ten in the Ameri\u00ad can Revolution, one in the War of 1812, seventy in the Civil War, five in the Spanish-American War, 152 in World THE NASSAU LIT 333 War I, 353 in World War II, twenty- nine in Korea, and twenty-four in Southeast Asia. Nassau Herald, The, published annu\u00ad ally by the graduating senior class, first appeared in 1864. Beginning as a four- page newspaper, it took the form of a paperback book in 1869 and added a hard cover in 1892. At first the contents were limited to the text of senior ora\u00ad tions and lists of participants in student activities. Gradually the editors added vital statistics and facts about the habits and opinions of the seniors, as gathered in an annual class poll. The Class of 1892 revealed that 84 of its 155 mem\u00ad bers smoked and 13 chewed, 41 had read the Bible through entirely, 36 had had to pawn some of their possessions to meet their bills, and 35 had written poetry. It also showed that 43 had sup\u00ad ported themselves partly, 7 entirely, and that, among those who cared to ex\u00ad press an opinion, 46 preferred bru\u00ad nettes, 35 blondes. In 1891 the seniors chose their favor\u00ad ite professor and thus started a practice which revealed such recurring favorites as Woodrow Wilson, Stockton Axson, George B. McClellan, Edwin Grant Conklin, Walter P. Hall, David A. McCabe, E. Baldwin Smith, and Roy Dickinson Welch. In 1909 they began also to pick their favorite preceptors, singling out repeatedly Frank Mac- Donald, Albert M. Friend, Jr., George Modlin, Alpheus T. Mason, and WiI- lard Thorp. \"Most likely to succeed\" was added to the class poll in 1904. John D. Rocke\u00ad feller, 3rd, got the most votes in 1929 as did his brother Laurance in 1932 and his nephew Steven in 1958. The Class of 1915 was the first to publish a photograph and biography of each of its members, thus introducing the modern form of the Herald. The biography enumerated the senior's suc\u00ad cesses at school and college and indi\u00ad cated what he intended to do next. The future Secretary of Defense James V. Forrestal '15 said he was undecided. Edmund Wilson '16 said he would \"en\u00ad ter the field of literature.\" F. Scott Fitzgerald 17 said he would do graduate study in English at Harvard and then go into newspaper work; in\u00ad stead he joined the army and wrote This Side of Paradise. George F. Ken- nan '25, who became ambassador to the Soviet Union, was another senior who \"didn't know\" what he was going to do. One of the oldest Nassau Herald cus\u00ad toms has been the inclusion of senior nicknames. In earlier years, when classes were smaller and campus life more leisurely, the nicknames could be pungent, as may be evident from the following garland of familiarities: Punk, Paddlefoot, Cupid, Toad, Bum, Phoebe, Sleepy, Wrinkle, Tubby, Booze, Giddle- Guy, Purity, Beowulf, Satan. Nassau Lit, The, the country's second oldest college literary magazine, first appeared in 1842 as the Nassau Monthly. * In 1847 it changed its name to the Nassau Literary Magazine and in 1930 adopted its briefer title. Its primary object, the first editor said, was \"to afford a medium through which young writers might publish in\u00ad cognito their first lucubrations to the world.\" Since manuscripts were sub\u00ad mitted under assumed names or ini\u00ad tials, they were not returned, and re\u00ad jections were often publicly announced in \"Notices to Correspondents\"\u2014 sometimes scornfully: \"The 'Parting,' by D.L.D.,\" the editors asserted about 334 THE NASSAU LIT one poem, \"is between the writer and common sense.\" Dissecting another \"effusion,\" they thought \"Philo's\" re\u00ad quest of his \"Dulcinea\" toward the end of the poem\u2014\"O, deem me not a fool\"\u2014absolutely indispensable, \"for the natural inference from the preced\u00ad ing verses,\" they said, \"would be that their maker was rather leaning that way.\" THE FOUNDERS During the first few years, a large part of the hit's contents was the work of three writers\u2014Theodore L. Cuyler 1841, George H. Boker 1842, and Charles G. Leland 1845. Cuyler, who contributed frequent essays on European and American cul\u00ad ture, also wrote \"A Chapter on College Writing\" that would have evoked an affirmative nod from many latter-day Lit editors: . . . counseled]. . . . In order to produce the highest effect, he must use short, simple, pointed words. . . . Nor let him be content to write a composition once, but rewrite, and rewrite it again, until he is well as\u00ad sured that there is not a word in it which is not the very word, in the very place. Cuyler became a minister in Brooklyn, and wrote eleven books and many arti\u00ad cles for the religious press. The Westminster, a Presbyterian periodi\u00ad cal, called him \"the greatest writer of spiritual English since John Bunyan.\" George H. Boker (q.v.), the first editor, contributed numerous poems and essays to its early issues, and in later life published two volumes of poetry and wrote eleven plays, besides serving as United States Minister to Turkey and to Russia. Charles G. Leland was the hit's most prolific contributor during the first four years. One piece of his that did not ap\u00ad pear was his Educatio Diaboli, a ballad about Satan's admission to Princeton, his involvement in student escapades, and his suspension by the faculty. In this work the poet's allusions to mem\u00ad bers of the faculty are less complimen\u00ad tary than his references to the Devil, which may explain why the hit denied itself the pleasure of its publication. All his life Leland published widely in a variety of fields, including gypsy lore and language, German literature, in\u00ad dustrial arts, and sexual psychology, but he became best known for the many editions of his German-dialect Hans Breitmann's Ballads. THE 1890s The hit carried brief reports of cam\u00ad pus happenings until the Princetonian was founded in 1876. About this time some authors began signing their names to their contributions, and by the 1890s the use of pseudonyms and initials had disappeared. In the early 1890s an informal liter\u00ad ary club called the Coffee House pro\u00ad vided a focal point for writers such as Jesse Lynch Williams 1892, Booth Tar- kington 1893 (qq.v.), and McCready Sykes 1894, during what was one of the hit's strongest periods. Williams was their leader, and Robert Bridges, who had been managing editor of the hit in 1879, was a valuable older friend; as editor of Scribner's Magazine he helped them and later generations of young Princeton writers break into print. Tarkington and Williams became Pulitzer Prize winners; Sykes won the affection of his Princeton contem\u00ad poraries with his accounts\u2014in which he mimicked Chaucerian style\u2014of Prince-THE NASSAU LIT 335 ton football exploits in Foe's Run and Other Poems (1904). THE \"GOLDEN AGE\" A remarkable group of writers made the years 1912 to 1917 one of the most fruitful periods in the hit's history. Its leader was Edmund Wilson 16 (q.v.), around whom campus writers gathered \"by a law [Dean Christian Gauss said] of literary gravitation.\" Other talented members included John Peale Bishop '17, Scott Fitzgerald 17 (qq.v.), and John Biggs '18. The members of this inner circle ex\u00ad hibited qualities reminiscent of those of the original founders. Bishop was the same patrician poet in his day that Boker had been in his, both drawing much of their inspiration from Euro\u00ad pean culture. Like Leland, Fitzgerald was an enfant terrible, although he was less well-read than Leland as an under\u00ad graduate and more successful as a writer in later life. Although their views and ultimate vocations were very dif\u00ad ferent, Wilson shared Cuyler's interest in having the right word in the right place, and went even further, desiring that \"every word, every cadence, every detail should perform a definite func\u00ad tion in producing an intense effect.\" QUESTIONS OF PROPRIETY Usually an unobtrusive member of the campus community, the Lit has on occasion been made conspicuous by al\u00ad leged lapses in taste. Early in the 1930s the Undergraduate Council suspended the editor of the Lit for publishing a poem which the Council deemed \"obscene and un-Princeton.\" This un\u00ad precedented action brought a flood of student protests to the Daily Princetonian. One undergraduate, who had read the poem more carefully than most, reported that its meaning was rather obscure and that the poem was not therefore completely successful, but that far from being obscene, its ob\u00ad ject was highly moral and indeed didac\u00ad tic. Another student expressed the hope that the Undergraduate Council would not rest on its laurels, but would now seek out other \"un-Princeton\" matters with which the University abounded, citing certain authors taught to freshmen by the classics and English departments and referring darkly to many \"un-Princeton\" books in the Li\u00ad brary, including one by a writer, named Shakespeare, \"which is full of bastards.\" The Undergraduate Council relented and changed its sus\u00ad pension to a reprimand. The unhappi- ness that prevailed during this episode was shared by almost everyone except the circulation manager of the Lit. On another occasion in the 1950s, the dean of the college felt obliged to place the editor and the author of a story on probation because of the au\u00ad thor's use of pithy Saxonisms in the dialogue. The Prince condemned this action, too, but this time there was no flood of letters, and the author reacted tolerantly: \"I'm not completely unsym\u00ad pathetic with the Dean,\" he said, \"but, on the other hand, I'm also sympathetic with myself.\" RETROSPECTIVES In February 1942, the Lit brought out a 196-page centennial issue, re\u00ad printing specimens of poetry and prose from the previous century together with new articles by President Dodds, Jacques Maritain, Booth Tarkington '93, Norman Thomas 05, and others. For that issue Frederick Morgan '43 and Richard M. Morse '43 were co- chairmen, Joseph D. Bennett '43, man\u00ad aging editor. A few years later, Mor\u00ad gan, Bennett, and William Arrowsmith 336 NATIONAL ACADEMY OF ENGINEERING '45 founded The Hudson Review, which became one of the best known and most respected American literary reviews. In 1976 the Nassau Lit published another retrospective issue, featuring contributions from past Lit notables like Tarkington and Fitzgerald, as well as from more recent contributors, among them, poets William Meredith '40, Galway M. Kinnell '48, and W. S. George Garrett '52 and John McPhee '53, and artist Frank Stella '58. * The Yale Literary Magazine was started in 1836. National Academy of Engineering, The, was established in 1964 \"to honor distinguished engineers of the nation and to bring to bear an unusual depth and breadth of engineering knowledge on matters of national concern.\" En\u00ad gineering had been a separate section of the National Academy of Sciences since 1919, and although the new Academy was founded under the larger group's charter and made responsible to its Council, it is largely autonomous. Princeton faculty members have been elected to the Academy in the fol\u00ad lowing years: 1968 Richard H. Wilhelm 1969 Courtland D. Perkins 1973 Mac E. Van Valkenburg 1975 Wallace D. Hayes 1976 Leon Lapidus 1977 Seymour M. Bogdonoff Professor Perkins became President of the Academy in 1975. National Academy of Sciences, The, is a society of scholars \"dedicated to the furtherance of science and its use for the general welfare.\" It was established in 1863 by an Act of Congress, which empowered it to create its own organi\u00ad zation and by-laws and called upon it to serve as an official adviser to the federal government on any question of science or technology. Among the Academy's fifty founding members were four scientists as\u00ad sociated with Princeton: Stephen Alex\u00ad ander, Arnold Guyot, Joseph Henry, and John Torrey. Henry was the Academy's second president, 1866 to 1878; and Frederick Seitz Ph.D. '34 its seventeenth, 1962 to 1969. Two associated organizations, the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine, were founded by the Academy in 1964 and 1970. The National Research Council, established in 1916, serves as the operating arm of the science and en\u00ad gineering academies. New members are elected annually by the current membership in recogni\u00ad tion of distinguished achievements in scientific research.

Near Eastern Studies at Princeton go back to the turn of the century when, as elsewhere, interest in this field, Bibli\u00ad cally oriented, centered on the ancient history of the \"cradle of civilization.\" The roots were diffuse, albeit vigorous; there were pioneer scholars of distinc\u00ad tion and beginnings of a superlative li\u00ad brary for teaching and research. The most dynamic pioneer was How\u00ad ard Crosby Butler (q.v.), a specialist in ancient Near Eastern archaeology and architecture who mounted expeditions to Syria and Anatolia in 1899, 1904, and 1909 and headed the notable excava\u00ad tions at Antioch and Sardis; he was Princeton's charter trustee of the Jerusalem School for Oriental Re\u00ad search. In 1901 he brought to Princeton NEAR EASTERN STUDIES 339 the noted German epigrapher, Enno Littmann, who had accompanied him in Syria; Littmann served as librarian of the Oriental collections and as lecturer in Semitic philology until 1906 when he returned to Tubingen. Four years later he was succeeded by another German scholar, Rudolph Briinnow, who was Professor of Semitic Philology. After Briinnow's death in 1917, the teaching of Semitics declined, and the develop\u00ad ment of Sanskrit and Indo-European philology began auspiciously under Harold H. Bender (q.v.), who was ap\u00ad pointed Professor of Indo-Germanic Philology in 1918. In 1927 Bender or\u00ad ganized the precursor of the Depart\u00ad ments of Near Eastern and East Asian Studies\u2014the Department of Oriental Languages and Literatures (later Oriental Studies); he served as its first chairman until 1944. Meanwhile ancient history and Se\u00ad mitics had been well served by David Paton 1874, a self-made Egyptologist who toiled in the western tower of Pyne Library translating important works in this field. In 1919 his mother founded the Paton chair in Ancient and Modern Literature, first occupied by William Robert Rogers of Drew Theological Seminary, a popular lecturer during his ten years as visiting professor, and then by Philip Khuri Hitti, who worked with Bender on comparative Indo-European and Semitic studies, and later gave his attention to Islamic and modern Near Eastern studies. Princeton's superlative Near Eastern library collections were begun with Arabic manuscripts collected by Robert Garrett 1897 (q.v.) and deposited in the University Library in 1900. He con\u00ad tinued to acquire and lend to the Uni\u00ad versity valuable Near Eastern collec\u00ad tions, and in 1941 gave them all to Princeton. The collections were further enriched by Littmann's acquisitions and by bequests of the personal libraries of Briinnow and Paton. In 1943 Garrett climaxed his contributions with the gift of the Cairene Yahuda Collection of over 5,000 medieval Arabic items. Thus Princeton has come to possess one of the two greatest collections of books on the Near East in the United States and by far the greatest collection of manu\u00ad scripts in the Western Hemisphere. In 1944 Hitti succeeded Bender as chairman, serving until 1954. The de\u00ad partment's founding of the country's pioneer Program in Near Eastern Studies after World War II was largely due to Hitti's vision and fund-raising abilities. This program concentrated on the modern Near East. Initially, the three major Islamic languages\u2014Arabic, Turkish, and Persian\u2014constituted the core of the program around which were grouped integrated courses in history, politics, sociology, economics, and re\u00ad lated subjects. Three appointments were made to the department to im\u00ad plement the new program: Walter L. Wright in Turkish studies, T. Cuyler Young in modern Persian, and Lewis V. Thomas in Arabic. On Wright's death in 1949, Thomas took over the work in Turkish. In 1951 the Program in Near Eastern Studies was reorganized as a separate interdisciplinary program emphasizing the social sciences, administered by a committee of representatives from the departments of economics, history, and politics, as well as of the department of oriental languages and literatures. The Program undertook to meet the lack of teacher-scholars in the sociology and politics of the Near East by providing language study and research opportuni\u00ad ties in the area for two social scientists. One of them, the sociologist Morroe Berger, later served twice as Director 340 NEAR EASTERN STUDIES of the Program for a number of years. The other, the political scientist Denkwart Rustow, eventually became Distinguished Professor of Political Science at City University of New York; his place was taken by Manfred Hal- pern in 1959. The department expanded during Young's chairmanship (1954-1969), with major emphasis on Arabic and Is\u00ad lam, including modern history and con\u00ad temporary affairs. The teaching was en\u00ad riched by foreign scholars who came frequently as visiting professors. Two regular appointments in the mid-1950s, Norman Itzkowitz and Martin Dickson, strengthened the Turkish and Persian fields respectively. John H. Marks, who came in 1954, has specialized in ancient Near Eastern history and West Semitic languages. A year later Rudolph Mach became Curator of Near Eastern Collections; within a decade he had made the Islamic collection, espe\u00ad cially for the medieval period, the best in North America; he has continued to add hundreds of important items to the manuscript collection. In 1956 the department added to its staff the Sinologist Frederick W. Mote\u2014its first appointment in the East Asian field. Under him and Japa- nologist Marius Jansen, this field of studies developed rapidly, and in 1969 the Department of Oriental Studies di\u00ad vided into the two departments of Near Eastern Studies and East Asian Studies (q.v\u00b7). In the mid-1960s Near Eastern Studies suffered grievous losses with the deaths of Ottoman historian Thomas and Arabic linguist Majid Said, and were further depleted by the departure, to head up new programs elsewhere, of Bayly Winder and Farhat Ziadeh, teachers in the Arabic-Islamic field. Reconstruction involved some change in emphasis. Medieval Islam and modern Arab and North African studies were strengthened by L. Carl Brown's arrival from Harvard; he served as chairman from 1969 to 1973. New depth in Islamic history was pro\u00ad vided by Abraham Udovitch, from Cornell. He is a Semitist and medieval Islamist with a special interest in neg\u00ad lected economic history; he became departmental chairman in 1973. These Arabists were joined in 1968 by Andras Hamori, a specialist in classical Arabic literature, and subsequently by similar specialists in Persian and Turkish. In 1970 modern Hebrew language and lit\u00ad erature were added to the department's curriculum. In 1972 John Willis was appointed for Islamic civilization in Af\u00ad rica. In the early 1970s the family of Cleveland and Bayard Dodge (both Class of 1909) endowed twin chairs in Near Eastern Studies to honor these two eminent alumni whose careers, in various and distinguished ways, were connected to that area of the world over the past half century. These two chairs made it possible to add faculty of un\u00ad usual distinction to the department. Bernard Lewis, the leading historian of the Near East in the English-speaking world, came to Princeton from the University of London in September 1974. He accepted the joint appoint\u00ad ment of the University as first Cleve\u00ad land Dodge Professor of Near Eastern Studies, and of the Institute for Ad\u00ad vanced Study as a long-term member of its School of Historical Studies. In Sep\u00ad tember 1975, Charles P. Issawi, the most renowned economist and eco\u00ad nomic historian of the Middle East, came to Princeton from Columbia Uni\u00ad versity as the first incumbent of the Bayard Dodge Professorship in Near Eastern Studies. NOBEL PRIZES 341 On July 1, 1977, the department was further enriched when the eminent his\u00ad torian Nina G. Garsoian came from Co\u00ad lumbia as dean of the Graduate School and professor of Byzantine and Arme\u00ad nian Studies. The same year, John H. Marks succeeded Abraham Udovitch as departmental chairman. Over the years Princeton's pioneer\u00ad ing has contributed much to the na\u00ad tional development of Near Eastern Studies. The department has provided leadership in cooperative ventures such as Princeton's National Critical Lan\u00ad guages Program, the Inter-University Summer Language Program, the Cen\u00ad ter for Arabic Study Abroad in Cairo, and the founding of the Middle East Studies Association; and also by its consultation with the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in the administration of the National Defense Foreign Language Act. Cooperative scholarship in the field has been fur\u00ad thered by the department's annual conference, begun in 1949; in 1974 it brought together in Princeton the first large international group of scholars in Islamic economic history. Not the least important contribution has been the number of well-trained Ph. D.'s the Department has sent out to universities in the United States and Canada, and in the Near East itself, as well as the per\u00ad sonnel contributed by the Program to business, government, and public affairs. T. Cuyler Young A. L. Udovitch New South, unlike its semantic oppo\u00ad site, Old North\u2014as Nassau Hall was once called\u2014is a building with little history, having been erected in 1965. However, its name was in the newspa\u00ad pers four years later when fifty mem\u00adbers of the Association of Black Colle\u00ad gians occupied it for eleven hours to protest University policy on invest\u00ad ments in companies doing business in South Africa. But this \"sit-in\" was a temperate exercise compared with the frequent and sometime riotous \"barring out\" of the faculty by students living in \"Old North\" early in the last century, not to mention the even livelier events that Nassau Hall survived in the cen\u00ad tury before. New South was built to provide more ample space for some of the business departments of the University and to release for faculty use the offices which these departments had occupied near the library. One of the first of the Uni\u00ad versity's high-rise buildings, it has two stories below ground and seven above. Designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes of New York, and built of glass and con\u00ad crete, it stands in the southern section of the Campus. The windows of the cafeteria on the seventh floor afford superb views of the campus and coun\u00ad tryside. Nobel Prizes have been awarded to seven Princeton graduates and two fac\u00ad ulty members. Woodrow Wilson, of the Class of 1879, 28th president of the United States won the Nobel peace prize for 1919. Arthur H. Compton, B.S. College of Wooster, 1913, Ph.D. (physics) Princeton, 1916, shared the physics award in 1927, while professor of physics at the University of Chicago, for his discovery of the change in wave length of scattered X-rays\u2014the \"Compton effect.\" Clinton J. Davisson, B.S. University of Chicago 1908, Ph.D. (physics) Princeton 1911, shared the physics award in 1937, while a research physi-342 NOBEL PRIZES cist at the Bell Telephone Laboratories, for his part in the diffraction of elec\u00ad trons by crystals which furnished the first experimental proof that the elec\u00ad tron, previously conceived of as a mate\u00ad rial particle, could also manifest itself as a wave. At Princeton he prepared his dissertation under the direction of Pro\u00ad fessor O. W. Richardson. Edwin M. McMillan, B. S. California Institute of Technology 1928, Ph.D. (physics), Princeton 1932, shared the 1951 prize in chemistry, while profes\u00ad sor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, for his part in the discovery of transuranium elements. John Bardeen, B. S. University of Wisconsin 1928, Ph.D. (mathematical physics) Princeton 1936, shared the physics award in 1956 for his part in the invention and development of the transistor at the Bell Telephone Labo\u00ad ratories, where he was a research physicist, and in 1972 shared his second Nobel physics prize for his work in superconductivity while professor of physics and electrical engineering at the University of Illinois. At Princeton he wrote his dissertation under the guidance of Professor Eugene P. Wigner. Robert Hofstadter, B. S. City Col\u00ad lege of New York 1935, Ph.D. (physics) Princeton 1938, shared the physics prize in 1961, while professor of physics at Stanford University, for his determi\u00ad nation of the size and shape of atomic nucleons. At Princeton he did his dis\u00ad sertation under the direction of Profes\u00ad sor Walker Bleakney. Eugene Paul Wigner, Dr. Ing. Technische Hochschule, Berlin 1925, who joined the Princeton faculty in 1930 and became Thomas D. Jones pro\u00ad fessor of mathematical physics in 1938, shared the physics prize in 1963 for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and elementary parti\u00ad cles. Richard P. Feynman, B. S. Mas\u00ad sachusetts Institute of Technology 1939, Ph.D. (physics) Princeton, 1942, shared the physics award in 1965, while professor of physics at California Insti\u00ad tute of Technology, for helping to solve the difficulties in carrying out quantita\u00ad tive calculations of the interplay be\u00ad tween charged particles\u2014a contribu\u00ad tion that opened up the field of quan\u00ad tum electrodynamics. At Princeton Feynmann worked on his dissertation under the guidance of Professor John A. Wheeler. Philip W. Anderson, A. B. Harvard University 1943, Ph.D. 1949, pre\u00ad viously professor of theoretical physics at Cambridge University, England, and currently Joseph Henry Professor of Physics at the University and con\u00ad sulting director of the physical research division of Bell Laboratories, shared with two other physicists the physics prize in 1977 for their \"fundamental theoretical investigations of the elec\u00ad tronic structure of magnetic and dis\u00ad ordered systems.\" Princeton takes pride, if no credit, in three other Nobel awards. Owen W. Richardson, a professor of physics at Princeton from 1906 to 1913 who left a strong mark on the depart\u00ad ment before his return to England, won the Nobel Prize in 1928. Eugene O'Neill, who spent a year at Princeton as a member of the Class of 1910, received the Nobel Prize in Lit\u00ad erature in 1936. Edward C. Kendall, B. S. Columbia 1908, Ph.D. 1910, who shared the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine in 1950 for his part in the dis\u00ad covery of cortisone at the Mayo Clinic, joined Princeton in 1951 as Visiting Professor of Chemistry at the Forrestal WHITNEY JENNINGS OATES 343 Research Campus, where he served until his death in 1972. Oates, Whitney Jennings (1904-1973), successively Ewing Professor of Greek, West Professor of Classics, and Avalon Professor of the Humanities, was a prime mover in the founding and de\u00ad velopment of a number of important University programs. Mike, as he was known to his colleagues and students, first came to Princeton from the Evanston Township High School in Il\u00ad linois as a member of the Class of 1925. He graduated summa cum laude in classics, earning his A.M. in 1927 and his Ph.D. in 1931. As student and teacher, he was associated with Princeton for forty-nine years. Chairman of the classics department for sixteen years, Oates published ex\u00ad tensively in his special fields of interest, Greek drama and philosophy, and played a leading role in the teaching of the classics in translation. He was fre\u00ad quently voted a favorite preceptor and lecturer in annual senior class polls. In the 1930s he was a principal organ\u00ad izer, and from 1945 to 1959 was chair\u00ad man, of the Special Program in the Humanities, an interdisciplinary plan of study that exerted lasting influence on the form and spirit of education at Princeton. According to the seniors' Faculty Song, the Program was con\u00ad cocted over coffee mugs in Here's to Princeton's esthete band, Making culture's final stand. In the Bait they all convene, Hinds, Godolphin, Oates, and Greene. During World War II, Oates served with the Marines in the Southwest Pacific. Soon after he came back to Princeton in 1945, he conceived and found the money for a plan to attract re\u00ad turning servicemen into college teach\u00ad ing; under his dynamic guidance this project eventually became the National Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Program (q-v.)\u00b7 Carrying further the essential ideas of the Special Program in the Hu\u00ad manities, he was largely responsible for the establishment in 1953 of the Coun\u00ad cil of the Humanities (q.v.)\u2014as a means of fostering significant teaching and re\u00ad search throughout this field\u2014and was its chairman until his retirement from the faculty in 1970. Outside of Princeton, he showed similar leadership as a founding member of the National Commission on the Humanities, whose 1963 report did much to secure the establishment by Congress of the National Foundation for the Arts and the Humanities. He was also president of the United Chap\u00ad ters of Phi Beta Kappa, a senior fellow of the Center of Hellenic Studies in Washington, and a director of the American Council of Learned So\u00ad cieties. Oates's ardent advocacy of humanis\u00ad tic learning nationally was matched at Princeton by the stimulating example he provided generations of Princeton- ians through his own humanity\u2014his good humor, kindheartedness, and cheerfulness. Robert F. Goheen, in turn Oates's student, col\u00ad league, and president, said that \"In his person and in his work he stood in the long, strong line of Christian humanists who have helped give spiritual as well as intellectural quality to this university down through the years. . . . He was imbued, in Professor Osgood's phrase, with 'an affectionate concern, incor\u00ad rigible and dominant, for his fellow men.' \" 344 OLD NASSAU Old Nassau has been Princeton's an\u00ad them since 1859. Its words were writ\u00ad ten that year by a freshman, Harlan Page Peck 1862, and published in the March issue of the Nassau Literary Magazine. When an effort to sing it to the tune of \"AuId Lang Syne\" proved unsuccessful, Karl A. Langlotz, who taught German in the college and di\u00ad rected a choral group, was persuaded to write music for it. Langlotz had studied music in Weimar under Liszt and had once played the violin in an or\u00ad chestra conducted by Wagner. He wrote the music for Old Nassau on the porch of his house at 160 Mercer Street one fine spring afternoon. The words and music appeared to\u00ad gether for the first time in Songs of Old Nassau, published in April 1859. A few days after this collection appeared, a group of students gathered near the Bulletin Elm at the northeast corner of Nassau Hall, after evening prayers, to try some of the songs. Most of the col\u00ad lege had assembled to hear the singing; when the group had finished their sing\u00ad ing of Old Nassau, the listeners re\u00ad sponded with an enthusiastic skyrocket cheer, which forecast the devotion with which succeeding generations of Princetonians would sing \"in praise of old Nassau.\" There has been some change in the words over the years. The opening line, originally \"Tune every harp and every voice,\" became \"Tune every heart and every voice\" early in the 1890s. Peck wrote seven verses, but three\u2014those about chaplet\"\u2014had dropped out of use by 1914. The words and music of the first verse and chorus are displayed below. The words of the other three verses are as follows: Let music rule the fleeting hour, Her mantle round us draw; And thrill each heart with all her power, In praise of Old Nassau. H. P.

Olympians from Princeton have placed among the top three in twenty-four events since the ancient games were revived in their modern form in 1896: fifteen in track and field, three in swimming, two in fencing and rowing, and one in basketball and pistol- shooting. In the first Olympic Games, Robert Garrett 1897 set a Princeton re\u00ad cord that has yet to be equalled when he won a third place, a second, and two firsts\u2014one in the discus throw, an event in which he had never competed before. Princeton's most recent Olym\u00ad pic winner was oarswoman Carol Brown '75, who earned a bronze medal as a member of the United States eight-oared crew that finished third at Montreal in 1976. Princetonians who have placed among the top three in their events have been:* 1896-ATHENS Robert Garrett 1897, first place, discus throw (95 feet, 7\u00bd inches); first place, shot put (36 feet, 2 inches); second place, long jump (20 feet, 3\u00bc inches); third place, high jump (5 feet, 73/e inches). Herbert B. Jamison 1897, second place, 400-meter run (55.2 seconds). Albert C. Tyler 1897, second place, pole vault (10 feet, 8 inches). 1900-PARIS Frank W. Jarvis '00, first place, 100- meter dash (10*/5 seconds). John F. Cregan 1899, second place, 800-meter run (2 minutes, 1.2 sec\u00ad onds). Robert Garrett 1897, third place, shot- put (40 feet, 7 inches). 1904-ST Louis William W. Coe 03, second place, shot-put (47 feet, 3 inches). John R. DeWitt 04, second place, hammer throw (164 feet, 11 inches). G. P. Serviss 03, second place, high jump (5 feet, 9 inches). 1920-ANTWERP Karl T. Frederick '03, gold medal, free pistol shooting at range of 50 meters (496 points). Henry Breckinridge 07, bronze medal, as member of the U.S. foil team which placed third. 1924-PARis William E. Stevenson '22, gold medal as member of winning team in 1600-meter relay (3 minutes, 16 seconds\u2014a new Olympic record). Ralph G. Hills '25, bronze medal, shotput (48 feet, \u00bd inch). 1928-AMSTERDAM Benjamin van D. Hedges, Jr., '30, silver medal, high jump (6 feet, 3\u00bc inches). 1932-LOS ANGELES Tracy Jaeckel '28, bronze medal, as member of U.S. epee team, which placed third. 1936-BERLIN Albert Vande Veghe '40, silver medal, 100-meter backstroke (1 minute, 7.7 seconds). 1964-TOKYO William W. Bradley, Jr. '65, gold medal as member (and captain) of winning 346 EUGENE O'NEILL U.S. basketball team which beat the U. S.S.R. team in the final game, 73-59. Jed R. Graef '64, gold medal in 200- meter backstroke (2 minutes, 10.3 seconds\u2014a world and Olympic re\u00ad cord). Seymour L. Cromwell II '56, silver medal in double sculls (7 minutes, 13.16 seconds). 1968-MEXICO CITY Ross Wales '69, bronze medal, 100- meter butterfly (57.2 seconds). 1976-MONTREAL Carol Brown '75, bronze medal, as member of women's eight-oared crew that placed third. In addition to the foregoing medalists, a score of other Princetonians have rep\u00ad resented the United States on various Olympic teams, and members of the faculty and administration have played key roles in the organization and devel\u00ad opment of the Games. Professor Wil\u00ad liam M. Sloane was a member of the international committee that organized the first Olympics in 1896, and Profes\u00ad sor Charles W. Kennedy 03 and Dr. Joseph W. Raycroft both served as vice-chairman of the United States Olympic Committee, with which Asa S. Bushnell '21 was identified in various capacities for almost forty years. Uni\u00ad versity Physician Harry R. McPhee was head physician for the United States teams in 1952, I960, and 1964, and Princeton's head trainer Edward G. Zanfrini was trainer for the United States teams in 1952, 1956, 1960, 1964, and 1968. * The practice of awarding gold, silver, and bronze medals to winners of first, second, and third places was not begun until 1908. O'Neill, Eugene [Gladstone] (1888- 1953), dramatist, entered Princeton in the fall of 1906 as a member of the Class of 1910 but, after encountering disci\u00ad plinary as well as scholastic difliculties, left at the end of freshman year without taking final examinations. He worked for a mail-order house and then went to sea. Later he was a newspaper reporter and studied for a time in George Pierce Baker's celebrated '47 Workshop at Harvard before embarking on the career that brought him the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1936. Orange Key Society was organized in 1935 on the model of Dartmouth's Green Key Society which had won President Dodds's admiration when he visited Hanover to speak at a con\u00ad ference there. Due at midnight, he missed a train connection and, arriving at two in the morning, was surprised and pleased to find a Green Key under\u00ad graduate waiting for him with a car, a thermos of hot coffee, and a friendly greeting. Originally the Orange Key's primary mission was to welcome visitors to the University and to shepherd athletic teams from other colleges around Princeton. Gradually it assumed other functions: the campus guide service, the Red Cross blood drive, the spon\u00ad sorship of student-faculty get-togeth\u00ad ers, the organization of dances and other social events, and\u2014its most dis\u00ad tinctive activity\u2014the Freshman Key- cept Program. The Keycept Program, whose name and methods were derived from the preceptorial system, helped to introduce freshmen to life at Princeton through periodic meetings in small groups with a Keyeeptor from the Junior Class. In recent years, in order to meet an expanding demand by visiting groups, the Orange Key has made the campus guide service its principal function. CHARLES GROSVENOR OSGOOD 347 Orchestra, University, can lay claim to rudimentary antecedents as far back as June, 1791, when a number of student musicians, seated in the belfry of Nas\u00ad sau Hall above the glow of six hundred candles illuminating its facade, enter\u00ad tained the crowd that had gathered to celebrate President Witherspoon's sec\u00ad ond marriage\u2014with, the United States Gazette reported, \"a most agreeable and delightful concert from different kinds of instruments.\" Almost a century later, a small \"In\u00ad strumental Club\" occasionally ap\u00ad peared in concerts with the newly formed Glee Club. Among its early members was flutist Henry B. Fine 1882, later dean of the faculty and of the departments of science. During their freshman year, the Class of 1890 formed a college or\u00ad chestra, which flourished until they graduated. Cellist William Shubael Conant 1890 eventually pursued a suc\u00ad cessful career as a consulting engineer, and on his death in 1952 left the Uni\u00ad versity $250,000 to endow the music professorship which bears his name. Early in this century, student musi\u00ad cians formed the Orphic Order, which carried on until the outbreak of the First World War. The University Or\u00ad chestra came into being after the war, under the direction of Richard L. Weaver. Since 1935, directors have been arranged for by the music de\u00ad partment, among them Harold Berke\u00ad ley, Moritz von Bomhard, Russell Ames Cook, Nicholas Harsanyi, Robert S. Freeman, Peter T. Westergaard, Mordechai Sheinkman, Bruce Ferden, and Michael Pratt, who became di\u00ad rector in 1977. One of Princeton's most memorable concerts took place in May 1973, when the University Orchestra, conducted by Peter Westergaard, and accom\u00adpanied by a chorus prepared by Walter Nollner, performed Beethoven's Ninth Symphony before an enthusiastic audi\u00ad ence that filled Alexander Hall to over\u00ad flowing. In recent years, as the opportunities for music study at Princeton have be\u00ad come more widely known, a steady in\u00ad crease in the number of highly qualified undergraduate instrumentalists has brought new strength to the University Orchestra and the programs it can offer. Osborn Clubhouse, The, is located at the northeast corner of Olden and Prospect Avenues, adjacent to the site of the former University Field (now oc\u00ad cupied by the Engineering Quad\u00ad rangle). For almost three quarters of a century, it provided training table facil\u00ad ities for Princeton and visiting athletic teams. Built in 1892, it was the gift of Henry Fairfield Osborn 1877, a mem\u00ad ber of the Faculty Committee on Out\u00ad door Sports, then Professor of Comparative Anatomy in the College and later director of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. In 1971, the clubhouse be\u00ad came the headquarters of the Third World Center (q.v.). Osgood, Charles Grosvenor (1871- 1964), Holmes Professor of Belles Lettres, was distinguished for the breadth of his learning and the influ\u00ad ence of his teaching. Well before his long life ended, he had become, in President Dodds's words, \"the dean of Princeton humanists.\" His alma mater was Yale, where he earned an A.B. in 1894 and a Ph.D. in 1899, and where he was teaching in 1905 when Woodrow Wilson called him to Princeton as one of the original pre\u00ad ceptors. He found the life of a precep\u00ad tor in Princeton congenial. 348 CHARLES GROSVENOR OSGOOD The town is small, the college large [he told his Yale classmates in their Twenty Year Record]. It is properly secluded, but not remote; and it gives a chance for the rearing of ideals upon equal support of the active and contemplative life. Friendliness between colleagues and, by the help of preceptorial teaching in small groups, between student and teacher . . . does much to effect in students just what a uni\u00ad versity ought\u2014to teach them the art of living a good life. He excelled as a preceptor. To him teaching was \"the intimate engaging of personality with personality through the medium of some liberal subject,\" and he gave weekly demonstrations of this concept in preceptorial confer\u00ad ences in his house at 92 Stockton Street\u2014in the winter, around the fire\u00ad place in his study. Osgood early acquired a taste for music, painting, and the classics, which he cultivated all his life. While still at Yale he taught classics for two years (Charles Seymour, later president of that university, was one of his stu\u00ad dents), but then concluded that he would find greater freedom in the teaching of English. \"Yet,\" he re\u00ad marked in later years, \"my first love never died, and I have lived a life of happy and unashamed bigamy.\" His course in \"English Literature and the Classics,\" was long a favorite among undergraduates, and the breadth of his interests is revealed by the subjects of some of his early works: The Classical Mythology of Milton's English Poems; the Middle English poem, The Pearl; Selections from the Works of Samuel Johnson; Vergil and the English Mind; Boccaccio on Poetry. His favorite English poet was Ed\u00admund Spenser. With the help of his wife, he prepared a concordance to Spenser's poems and was later general editor of a ten-volume variorum edition of his works, a monumental task ex\u00ad tending through a quarter of a century. Knowing that undergraduates were often careless spellers, he always began his lectures on Spenser by printing on the blackboard: EDMUND SPENSER. He could discourse for hours on Spenser's love of English rivers, the poetic skill of his sonnet sequence the Amoretti, and the social, political, and esthetic back\u00ad grounds of The Faerie Queene. In 1935 he was persuaded to write a history of English literature for class\u00ad room use. It was called The Voice of Engfond. \"I have small excuse, I know,\" he wrote in the preface, \"for rehearsing the old tale herein set down, except that it is an old story, and a good one, and many are the ways of telling it.\" Osgood's way, reviewers agreed, was one of the best, and one colleague doubted that any textbook was ever written with such grace and lucidity. Osgood's broad learning was matched by a wide acquaintance with all kinds of people. Outside the Uni\u00ad versity he made many friends as an elder in the First Presbyterian Church and as a trustee of the Princeton Public Library, and he joined the Masonic Order to enlarge his acquaintanceship. On the train to New York one day a younger colleague heard Osgood, then in his sixties, quote Samuel Johnson to the effect that as a man grows older, he is willing to accept life on easier terms. Later he learned that Osgood was on his way to Artie McGovern's gym\u00ad nasium, where he went twice a week to sweat it out with, among other people, Babe Ruth. Osgood voluntarily retired in 1937 to concentrate on his writing. In 1941 he JOSEPH DAVID OZNOT 349 brought out his greatly admired Poetry as a Means of Grace, and in 1956 he put the capstone on the variorum edi\u00ad tion of Spenser. The same year saw his Boccaccio on Poetry, first printed in 1930, reissued in a paperback edition. His preface for this was typically Os- goodian: At eighty-five a man has no more right to tamper with the work of his fifties than with the work of another man. Indeed this book was the work of another man, younger by a genera\u00ad tion than I, and, among all my issue of lesser years, my favorite. I am con\u00ad tent that it should survive without correction or change. Many honors came to Osgood during his later years. His old student, Presi\u00ad dent Seymour, conferred on him a Yale Litt.D. on the fiftieth anniversary of his graduation; Princeton awarded him the same degree a few years later. A former student anonymously endowed the Os\u00ad good Book Fund, and the trustees es\u00ad tablished four advanced graduate fel\u00ad lowships in his name. But, as Willard Thorp, his successor as Holmes Profes\u00ad sor, observed, his greatest \"honor\" was the devotion of hundreds of his former students who visited him and wrote to him until virtually the day of his death. Outing Club. Except for a year during World War II, the Princeton Outing Club has been in continuous existence since 1941. With a donated cabin in Vermont and a vehicle purchased with annual dues, the club's original raison d'etre was to promote skiing. In fact it began as a ski club and was a member of the Eastern Ski Association. More re\u00ad cently its program has broadened \"to facilitate and promote the participation in and enjoyment of outdoor activities.\" Since its inception, the Outing Club (and for a brief period of time a spin-off Mountaineering Club) has specialized in outdoor activities: climbing, deep sea fishing, skiing, canoeing, hiking and cruising. For a fifteen-year period (until the early sixties) it was the second largest organization on campus with 125 members. In the mid-1970s it ex\u00ad perienced a revival, partly due to the influence of a more recent develop\u00ad ment, the Outdoor Action program. Under the aegis of the dean of stu\u00ad dent affairs office, Outdoor Action began in 1973. So far, over 1000 stu\u00ad dents, staff, and faculty have partici\u00ad pated in its programs. Essentially, it is a student staffed and operated program designed to enable diverse members of the university community to share ex\u00ad periences in the outdoors. As in the case of Outward Bound, its groups be\u00ad came involved in canoeing, hiking, backpacking, climbing, caving, and orienteering. Most of the trips are taken in the Delaware Water Gap or in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. It is in\u00ad creasingly being used as a teaching re\u00ad source by academic departments. John Andrew Brown Oznot, Joseph David, was probably the best known character admitted to the University in his time. His qualifica\u00ad tions were eminently meritorious. The Admission Office's file on him showed that at high school in East Lansing, Michigan, he was a top student, a clas\u00ad sicist, a concert pianist, and class treas\u00ad urer, with College Examination Board scores in the 700s. Notice of his admission to the Class of 1968 was accordingly sent him on April 16, 1964, and on the same day his name duly appeared on the official ad\u00ad mission list posted in West College. Two days later newspapers from coast 350 PALMER HALL to coast carried an Associated Press re\u00ad port that Joseph David Oznot \"was not,\" that the University had been tricked into admitting a fictitious char\u00ad acter by a clever, well-executed hoax, perpetrated by six sophomores, four at Princeton, one at Columbia, one at Michigan State University. The Michigan State sophmore had submitted Oznot's preliminary applica\u00ad tion for admission in October, giving his fraternity house as Oznot's address. During the Christmas recess the Co\u00ad lumbia sophomore came to Princeton for Oznot's interview at the Admission Office and made a favorable impres\u00ad sion. In January two of the Princeton sophomores took Oznot's College Board exams, with highly creditable re\u00ad sults. The final application papers, with space for marks and comment by the high school, were received by the Michigan State sophomore, and care\u00ad fully filled out by the six conspirators. They settled on April 1 for Oznot's birthday and private detective as the occupation of his father, William H. Oznot (W.H.O.). E. Alden Dunham, who was then Di\u00ad rector of Admission, found the hoax \"ingenious,\" and took a professional view about Joseph David Oznot. \"We would have loved,\" he said, \"to have A somewhat similar personage, Ephriam Di Kahble, was much talked about in earlier days by the Class of 1939. Ephriam did not, however, sur\u00ad mount the hurdle of the Admission Office. He appeared out of nowhere sometime in his sophomore year and similarly disappeared in his senior year. His name kept cropping up on chapel attendance cards in the Dean's office and the Registrar received examination grades for him in several courses. His classmates recall last seeing him at an intercollegiate cross-country race in Van Cortlandt Park one hazy Indian summer afternoon. Ephriam started out with the other runners but never returned. BERT HORMONE '17 Another Princetonian of some re\u00ad nown, Bert Hormone '17, was com\u00ad pletely unknown in student days. As sometimes happens he did not blossom out until after graduation. In his case he was first mentioned in 1917's class notes in the Alumni Weekly in the spring of 1937, shortly before their twentieth reunion. He sounded like an intriguing person but, although several in the class had vague stirrings of their memories, no one could place him with certainty. Under questioning, the class secretary, Harvey Smith, admitted that Adelbert l'Homme-dieu X. Hormone \u2014Bert's full name\u2014was his brain child, created to stimulate interest in the re\u00ad union. The class made Bert welcome and in later years from time to time different members reported chance encounters with him all over the world. Hormone became a Colonel in the Foreign Le\u00ad gion of France, and Smith faithfully chronicled his global exploits, marital as well as martial. Shortly before the class's fiftieth reunion he reported that Bert had died and been buried in his beloved Tahiti, his grave covered with flowers kept fresh by the tears of his several grieving widows. Palmer Hall was given by and named for Stephen S. Palmer, trustee of the University from 1908 to 1913. At its dedication in 1909 he said he had made this gift in recognition of the \"absolute necessity of extending Princeton's PALMER STADIUM 351 usefulness in the field of science and of placing her in a position where she can respond to the demands that will be made upon her.\" The facilities thus provided for in\u00ad struction and research (three floors with a total area of about two acres) en\u00ad abled the Department of Physics to re\u00ad spond to the demands made upon it for its first thirty years. But the accelerat\u00ad ing demands in the next three decades were such that facilities three times the size of Palmer were needed, and when Jadwin Hall (q.v.) was completed in 1969, the eastern portion of Palmer was given over to underclass instruction in physics, and other subjects, the west\u00ad ern portion to East Asian Studies and the Program in the History and Philos\u00ad ophy of Science. Statues of Benjamin Franklin and Joseph Henry, by Daniel Chester French, flank the front entrance of Palmer Laboratory, and high up on the rear wall of the west wing\u2014to remind posterity that Palmer was built during the tenure of the twenty-sixth presi\u00ad dent of the United States\u2014an energetic figure shakes a big stick. Palmer House, named for charter trus\u00ad tee and benefactor Edgar Palmer, was bequeathed to the University by his widow in 1968 on condition that it be used exclusively for \"college purposes\" for at least twenty-five years. Mrs. Palmer also left $250,000 for the devel\u00ad opment of the house and grounds and a $200,000 trust fund to provide for maintenance. Since its acquisition Palmer House has been used to provide accommodations and meeting rooms for trustees and guests of the University. Situated at the northeast corner of Bayard Lane and Nassau Street, it was designed and built by Charles Stead- man in 1825 for the daughter of John Potter, wealthy merchant of Charles\u00ad ton, South Carolina, who had married the naval hero, Robert F. Stockton 1813. In 1923 it became the home of Edgar Palmer '03, a charter trustee from 1936 to 1949, who gave Palmer Stadium in memory of his father, Stephen S. Palmer, also a trustee and the donor of Palmer Hall. Palmer Stadium was given by Edgar Palmer '03 as a memorial to his father, Stephen S. Palmer, a trustee of the University from 1908 to 1913 and the donor of Palmer Hall. Designed by Henry S. Harden- burgh, the stadium was completed in 1914, the same year as the Yale Bowl. Yale diminished Princeton's enjoyment of the Palmer Stadium dedication on November 14 by winning the annual football game, 19 to 14; but Harvard took even more away from Yale's pleas\u00ad ure at the dedication of the Bowl a week later with a 36 to 0 triumph that led one sportswriter to observe: \"Yale had the bowl, but Harvard supplied the punch.\" Like Harvard's stadium, which was built in 1903, Princeton's followed the U-shape of the ancient Greek stadium, while the Yale Bowl was modeled on the elliptical design characteristic of the Roman colosseum and the amphithea\u00ad ter at Pompeii. The completely en\u00ad closed Yale Bowl had no facilities for track meets. The open end in the Har\u00ad vard and Princeton stadiums, which reduced the number of seats available for football games, made possible the 220-yard straightaway essential for track meets. Palmer Stadium is slightly longer and a good deal wider than the standard an\u00ad cient Greek stadium, which was used only for track and got its name from the Greek word for the distance of its most 352 MAURICE PATE common race, the stade, which was ap\u00ad proximately an eighth of a Roman mile, or a little shorter than our 220- yard dash. Palmer Stadium's capacity is 42,000, which has sometimes been stretched to 52,000 by the erection of wooden stands at the open end. A new all-weather-surface track was constructed in Palmer Stadium in 1978. It was named the Erdman-McGraw Track in honor of Charles R. Erdman '19, track captain in 1919 and 1920, and Curtis W. McGraw '19, football captain in 1919. Pate, Maurice '15 (1894-1965), a found\u00ad er (with Herbert Hoover) and first executive director of UNICEF, was born in Pender, Nebraska, of Welsh ancestry and came to Princeton from East Denver High School in Colorado. His college classmates later remem\u00ad bered him as \"a tall, dark, wavy-haired figure of boundless geniality and seem\u00ad ingly infinite energy, whose view of the world was much more advanced than that of most of us.\" He majored in mathematics and physics, managed the business affairs of the Lit, worked on the undergraduate Red Cross Commit\u00ad tee, ran the launch on Lake Carnegie for rowing coach J. Duncan Spaeth, took his meals with a nonclub group who called themselves the Gargoyles, won election to Phi Beta Kappa, and graduated with high honors. The following spring he left his job as bank clerk in Iowa and won a place, after much persistence, on Herbert Hoover's Commission for Relief in Bel\u00ad gium, thus beginning a lifelong friend\u00ad ship with Hoover. After spending 1917 and 1918 overseas with the A.E.F., he was again associated with Hoover, this time for three years as a member of the American Relief Administration in Po\u00ad land, with special responsibility for feeding Polish children. In the Second World War, after seventeen years as salesman, importer, and investment banker, he returned to relief work, first as president of the Commission for Polish Relief, then with the American Red Cross as director of Relief to Pris\u00ad oners of War. At the end of the war Pate was once more called on by Hoover, in this case to assist him in filling a request by Pres\u00ad ident Truman to help in \"the organiza\u00ad tion of measures to alleviate the post\u00ad war famine.\" Pate accompanied Hoover on a tour of stricken areas. On their re\u00ad turn, Hoover's recommendations led to the establishment of the United Na\u00ad tions International Children's Emer\u00ad gency Fund (UNICEF) with Pate as Executive Director. (Later, when this organization was given permanent sta\u00ad tus, it was renamed the United Nations Children's Fund, but it retained its original acronym.) Under Pate's leadership, UNICEF grew to be the United Nations's most famous and respected agency, a world-wide operation providing, dur\u00ad ing his administration, food and medi\u00ad cal aid for upwards of a hundred million children. Many people helped: political leaders whose nations contributed funds, artists who designed UNICEF greeting cards, school-children who collected money at Halloween. But it was Pate's personal integrity and self\u00ad lessness that inspired all the others. Speaking of the United Nations, Dag Hammarskjold said, \"The work of UNICEF is at the heart of the matter\u2014 and at the heart of UNICEF is Maurice Pate.\" During the Hungarian uprising of 1956, when the government would admit no other U.N. official, Pate went to Budapest and, after walking the WILLIAM PATERSON 353 streets in a three-day survey, dis\u00ad patched orders for the UNICEF aid he saw was needed. In 1960 he arrived in Leopoldville soon after the outbreak of the Congo crisis to provide badly needed food, having been summoned for this mission by Dag Hammarskjold, from a movie house, only three nights before. Introducing Pate at a UNICEF dinner, Herbert Hoover called him \"the most efficient human angel I have ever known.\" He was decorated by Belgium, Ecuador, France, The Netherlands, and Poland, and was honored\u2014closer to home\u2014by the award of the Class of 1915's Merit Cup in 1950 and Princeton's honorary degree of Doctor of Philanthropy in 1958. In 1960 the Norwegian Committee for UNICEF proposed his nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize. Declining this honor for himself, Pate suggested that UNICEF be nominated instead. This was done, and UNICEF received the prize in 1965, the year that Pate died. At his funeral, the organist played \"He Shall Feed His Flock,\" from Handel's Messiah; U Thant said that \"the United Nations and the world's children\" were \"infinitely the richer for his long and devoted service\"; the minister read the Parable of the Loaves and Fishes; and a children's choir sang the anthem \"Let All Things Now Liv\u00ad ing,\" to a traditional Welsh melody. The service closed with these words from the Bhagavad Gita, chosen by Mrs. Pate: One who does one's duties for the love of God, who considers God to be the Supreme Goal of life, who has no attachment, no personal ambition or self-interest, who has no inimical or bitter feelings against anyone in the whole world, will surely reach God. Paterson, William (1745-1806), one of the principal founders of the govern\u00ad ments of New Jersey and the United States, was brought up in the village of Princeton, where his father, a Scotch- Irish immigrant tinsmith and shop\u00ad keeper, settled when William was five years old. As a boy of ten he watched the local mason, William Worth, erect Nassau Hall and when he was fourteen he went there to live as a student in the College. For four years he followed the classi\u00ad cal curriculum of that day, excelling in the monthly orations then required of every student, and graduated near the top of his class in 1763. While reading law with Richard Stockton 1748, the leading attorney in Princeton, he kept in touch with the College and helped found the Well Meaning Club, fore\u00ad runner of the Cliosophic Society. At Commencement in 1766 he received the degree of Master of Arts and deliv\u00ad ered an eloquent and widely admired oration on \"Patriotism.\" In 1769, shortly after he had begun the practice of law (supplementing his meagre income by keeping a general store), he wrote a college friend that \"to live at ease and pass through life with\u00ad out much noise and bustle\" was all he wished for. Six years later, however, when he was thirty, he embarked on one of the most active public careers of his generation, serving successively as secretary of the New Jersey Provincial Congress, member of the convention that drafted the state constitution, first attorney general of New Jersey, head of the New Jersey delegation to the fed\u00ad eral Constitutional Convention, one of the first two United States senators from New Jersey, governor of New Jer\u00ad sey, and finally, for the last thirteen years of his life, associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. From 354 FRANCIS LANDEY PATTON 1787 to 1802 he was also a trustee of the College. At the federal Constitutional Con\u00ad vention (q.v.) Paterson offered the New Jersey \"small states\" plan in opposition to the Virginia \"large states\" plan drafted by James Madison 1771, but then accepted the Connecticut com\u00ad promise supported by Oliver Ellsworth 1766, which was adopted. Paterson was short, modest, and unassuming in ap\u00ad pearance, but he was one of those men, William Pierce, a delegate from Georgia, noted in his journal, \"whose powers break in upon you, and create wonder and astonishment.\" While senator, he helped Oliver Ellsworth draft the Judiciary Act of 1789. While governor he undertook the codification of all existing New Jersey laws\u2014the English statutes which by the state constitution remained in force, as well as acts adopted by the legislature since the Revolution. He continued this monumental task after his elevation to the Supreme Court, and the results of his labors, the first published Laws of the State of New Jersey, appeared in 1800. Patton, Francis Landey (1843-1932), twelfth president of Princeton, was born in Warwick, Bermuda, on January 22, 1843. His early schooling was at Warwick Academy; later he attended Knox College of the University of To\u00ad ronto and studied for two years at Princeton Theological Seminary. After ordination in June 1865, he held pastorates in New York City, Nyack, Brooklyn, and Chicago. His teaching career began in 1872 with his appoint\u00ad ment as Cyrus Hall McCormick Profes\u00ad sor of Didactic and Polemical Theology at the Presbyterian Theological Semi\u00ad nary of the Northwest (now McCormick Seminary). In conjunction with his faculty duties, Patton was expected to defend conservative Presbyterianism against the new liberal currents of thought that had all but taken over the Chicago Pres\u00ad bytery. Thin, bespectacled, wearing side whiskers, a white lawn tie and a black frock coat, Patton looked every bit the part he was called to play. He plunged into the task with zeal, as editor of the Interior, a Presbyterian weekly, and as professor and public speaker. The culmination of his crusade came in April 1874, with a much- publicized heresy trial of the Rev. David Swing, the most popular rep\u00ad resentative of Chicago liberalism, whom Patton charged with serious de\u00ad partures from the faith. Patton lost his case before the Presbytery, but gained a great reputation as the eloquent champion of orthodoxy, leading to his election as Moderator of the General Assembly in 1878. Three years later, Princeton Theological Seminary ap\u00ad pointed him to a new chair in the Rela\u00ad tions of Philosophy and Science to the Christian Religion, endowed especially for Patton by Robert L. Stewart. When Patton arrived in Princeton in the spring of 1881, he retained the stiff, formal appearance that seemed to re\u00ad flect his conservative views, but his manner mellowed during the years that followed. The side whiskers disap\u00ad peared, the high collar came down, the white lawn tie gave way to a simple black business tie. His reputation as a teacher and theologian grew rapidly, and his services as an after-dinner speaker were soon much in demand. Even those who disagreed with his or\u00ad thodox beliefs admired his platform brilliance embellished as it was with literary allusions and laced with incisive wit. In 1884, he added to his Seminary schedule the teaching of a course at FRANCIS LANDEY PATTON 355 Princeton College in Ethics and the Philosophy of Religion. But the se\u00ad verest test of his career came in 1888, when he was elected by the trustees of the College to the office of the presi\u00ad dency held so ably for many years by the much-revered McCosh. Patton's election did not enthuse all Princetonians. Alumni had hoped not only for an educator, but also for an ex\u00ad perienced administrator who would bring efficiency and system to the ex\u00ad panding business needs of the College. Some noted that he was not even an American citizen. Undergraduates feared that they were to be \"admon\u00ad ished, sermonized, disciplined after the John Knox fashion.\" But Pat\u00ad ton managed to allay many doubts in his first speaking engagement. Before the New York alumni in March 1888, he alluded to his predecessors, particu\u00ad larly Witherspoon and McCosh, say\u00ad ing, \"It is manifest that there is more joy among the Alumni over the one President who has been naturalized than over the ninety-and-nine that have needed no naturalization.\" Amid fre\u00ad quent laughter and applause, he re\u00ad ferred to the criticism that he lacked business acumen by saying that he be\u00ad lieved that a \"college president ought to know an interest-coupon from a railway-ticket, and that he ought to be able to understand a balance-sheet as well as to grade an examination-paper.\" Continuing, Patton referred to the value of diversity among a student body and explained, \"I am not prepared to say that it is better to have gone and loafed than never to have gone at all, but I do believe in the genius loci; and I sympathize with Sir Joshua Reynolds when he says, that there is around every seminary of learning, an atmos\u00ad phere of floating knowledge where every one can imbibe something pecul\u00adiar to his own original conceptions.\" Perceptive though this observation was, unfortunately the subordinate clause, \"it is better to have gone and loafed than never to have gone at all,\" was to be most remembered and later often quoted out of context as evidence of Patton's casual attitude toward scholarship. The classes of the nineties\u2014the \"golden nineties\" to their members\u2014 were unanimous in their respect and af\u00ad fection for Patton. His course in ethics was popular, and when he preached at Chapel, one of his students recalled, \"the most indifferent of loafers slouched over to hear him.\" His kindly wisdom and ready wit soon became legendary, and students frequently sought him out for guidance and coun\u00ad sel. During Patton's administration, Princeton underwent great change. The student body increased from slightly over 600 to more than 1300, while the faculty, too, more than dou\u00ad bled. Patton appointed a number of both promising and accomplished scholars and teachers who soon brought new lustre to the community. Among them were Woodrow Wilson, Bliss Perry, John Grier Hibben, Winthrop More Daniels, George McLean Harper, Paul and Henry van Dyke, and Howard Crosby Warren. During the same time, more than a dozen major buildings were completed, The social life of the students was also changing as eating clubs proliferated. The clubs, together with the surging interest in athletics, particularly football, created a new atmostphere on campus and an emphasis on \"college life\" rather than college studies. The climax of the \"gold\u00ad en nineties\" came in 1896 during the Sesquicentennial Celebration when Patton proclaimed that the College 356 FRANCIS LANDEY PATTON would \"in all future time be known as Princeton University.\" The change in title, hailed as signal\u00ad ing the beginning of a new era in the history of Princeton, also marked the beginning of the end for the Patton ad\u00ad ministration, for it brought sharply into focus the president's failures as an administrator. Even by standards of that day, the administrative structure of Princeton was spare to the extreme. Patton conducted college affairs from his study in Prospect. He had no per\u00ad sonal secretary until 1895 when he as\u00ad signed that position to his son, George Stevenson Patton '91, and there was no college or university secretary until the election of Charles Williston McAlpin in December 1900. Patton was assisted by only one dean for most of his term, during which he turned aside the fac\u00ad ulty's urgent appeals to inaugurate a system of deans to accommodate the expanding institution. Faculty accounts indicate that Patton lacked initiative in important policy matters, resisted meaningful curriculum reform, was lax in matters of discipline and in scholarly standards\u2014in short, as one faculty member put it, was \"a wonderfully poor administrator.\" To many of the faculty, enthused by the high promise of the Sesquicenten- nial, the time seemed at hand to take concrete measures toward making Princeton in fact what she now claimed to be in name. With little help from the president, the faculty did manage an important step forward with the estab\u00ad lishment, by the trustees, of the Graduate School in 1900. In its admin\u00ad istrative structure, Patton was ef\u00ad fectively circumvented, since the dean, Andrew Fleming West, appointed di\u00ad rectly by the trustees, was given nearly autonomous powers. On the other hand, faculty committees labored for nearly two years to reform the cur\u00ad riculum, but Patton remained uncon\u00ad vinced that a student's performance could thus be improved and succeeded in shunting aside the proposals. Significantly, the efforts of the faculty reformers gained the sympathetic at\u00ad tention of many influential trustees who, although they continued to ad\u00ad mire Patton as a teacher, preacher, and public speaker, were becoming deeply concerned about his administrative in\u00ad adequacies. The Board of Trustees it\u00ad self had changed its profile during the 1890s as the traditional clerical majority was slowly reduced by the election of more business and professional men. Most of the sixteen new trustees elected in the last five years of the cen\u00ad tury were successful businessmen and lawyers, products of a burgeoning in\u00ad dustrial America, who valued efficiency and who were not inclined to be patient for long with Patron's methods. The climax came during the spring of 1902 when several trustees and faculty proposed to Patton that an executive committee of two trustees and three faculty members be formed to assume many of the president's administrative powers. Patton protested this reduction in his control of university affairs, but even his friends on the board gave him little encouragement. Finally, after some negotiation, he decided that res\u00ad ignation was the better part of wisdom, and he resigned at the trustees' meet\u00ad ing on June 9, 1902. The board, with Patton's strong endorsement, immedi\u00ad ately chose Woodrow Wilson to be his successor. Patton did not leave his office empty-handed. To compensate him for retiring six years earlier than he had in\u00ad tended, a group of trustees, alumni, and friends agreed to give him a sum in cash that, together with his yearly sal-WILDER PENFIELD 357 ary of $4000 as Professor of Ethics for one term a year, would equal for six years his salary as president of the Uni\u00ad versity. His career was by no means ended, for not only did he continue to teach at both University and Seminary, but in the fall of 1902 he accepted elec\u00ad tion to the new office of president of Princeton Theological Seminary. Whatever his deficiencies as an ad\u00ad ministrator, Patton continued high in the affection of students, faculty, and alumni. He also retained his sense of humor. At one time, when asked by a Seminary visitor if he had any connec\u00ad tion with the University, he wryly re\u00ad plied, \"Yes, indeed, I am President of Princeton University\u2014once removed.\" Patton retired from the Seminary in 1913 and returned to his beloved Ber\u00ad muda, there to write and preach, com\u00ad ing to the States occasionally to lecture. He went on speaking out on behalf of scriptural and doctrinal integrity in numerous controversies that arose in the Presbyterian church, and he pre\u00ad sented his case for orthodoxy most fully in his book, Fundamental Christianity, published when he was 83. \"We cannot change Christianity,\" he wrote, \"We may reject it if we please, but its mean\u00ad ing is plain.\" He died in Bermuda on November 25, 1932. David W. Hirst Penfield, Wilder [Graves] 13 (1891- 1976), world-famous brain surgeon, flected toward the end of his long, pro\u00ad ductive life that \"the only certain vir\u00ad tue\" that came into the world with him at his birth in Spokane, Washington on January 26, 1891 was \"tenacity of pur\u00ad pose.\" When his father's medical practice failed and he was unable to support the family, his mother took his elder brother and sister and eight-year-old Wilder to live with her parents in Hud\u00ad son, Wisconsin. Following his gradua\u00ad tion from the Galahad School in Hud\u00ad son, which his mother had helped found, Penfield entered Princeton, where he was determined to make him\u00ad self an all-round scholar, athlete, and leader so that he might qualify for a Rhodes Scholarship\u2014an ambition his mother had encouraged in him from the time he was thirteen. The best he could do in football his first year, in competition with many heavier and speedier players from large eastern schools, was to qualify as a substitute on the freshman team. That winter, on the advice of Heff Herring '07, Princeton football player, wrestler, and Rhodes Scholar, he went out for wrestling, and thereby developed large neck muscles, outgrew his shirts, won the interclass freshman-sophomore wrestling match, and eventually found a place on the varsity football team as a first-string tackle (at 170 pounds, a weight he maintained all his life). He had previously thought he would never want to enter the profession in which his father had failed, but at the end of his sophomore year, an en\u00ad thusiasm engendered by Professor Conklin's biology lectures\u2014and a long-standing desire to help his fellow man inculcated in him by his mother\u2014 led him to decide on a career in medi\u00ad cine. Penfield looked forward to beginning his medical education at Oxford, but\u2014despite his having been football tackle, baseball manager, class presi\u00ad dent and, according to his classmates, \"the most respected\" and \"best all- round man\"\u2014he lost out for the Rhodes Scholarship from New Jersey to an \"excellent fellow\" from Rutgers. In\u00ad stead, he devoted the year after gradua-358 WILDER PENFIELD tion to earning money for his medical education by coaching the Princeton freshman football team and then teach\u00ad ing at the Galahad School. In the mid\u00ad dle of the year, he received word that a Rhodes Scholarship for the following year had been awarded him, and he was accepted for admission to Merton College, which granted him special permission to defer his entrance until the end of the autumn of 1914 so that he might fulfill an agreement to coach the Princeton varsity football team. At Oxford, he was deeply influenced by Charles Sherrington, \"in his heyday, the world's foremost neurophysiolo- gist,\" who made him realize that in the nervous system was \"the unexplored field\u2014the undiscovered country in which the mystery of the mind of man might some day be explained.\" He was also strongly affected by Sir William Osier, Canadian-born Regius Professor of Medicine (\"a hero to the rising gen\u00ad eration of medical men\") at whose home he convalesced in 1916 after a German torpedo blew up the ship on which he was crossing the English channel to serve in a Red Cross hospital in France. After two years at Oxford, he entered the Johns Hopkins Medical School where he received his M.D. in 1918. The following year he was surgical intern at the Peter Bent Brigham Hos\u00ad pital in Boston, serving an apprentice\u00ad ship under brain surgeon Harvey Cush- ing. But the memory of the \"un\u00ad discovered country\" he had glimpsed through Sherrington's lectures con\u00ad tinued to intrigue him. He accordingly returned to Oxford for the third and final year of his Rhodes Scholarship as a graduate student in neurophysiology under Sherrington and followed that with a year as a research fellow in neurology at the National Hospital in London. Returning to the United States in 1921, he rejected a lucrative position as a surgeon at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit\u2014because it would have af\u00ad forded him no opportunity for re\u00ad search\u2014and accepted a post as as\u00ad sociate in surgery at Columbia Univer\u00ad sity and Presbyterian Hospital. There he developed his surgical techniques under Allen O. Whipple, Princeton '04, and organized and pursued re\u00ad search in a laboratory of neurocytology. During his postgraduate years in Ox\u00ad ford and London, Penfield had turned from experimental neurophysiology toward neurosurgery because he be\u00ad lieved that, since the neurosurgeon could lay bare the living human brain, he should be able to study and influ\u00ad ence the brain's physiological activity and thus become \"a neurologist-in\u00ad action.\" As he came to realize that he could not carry out an effective ap\u00ad proach to knowledge of the human brain and make use of that knowledge all by himself, he began to dream of or\u00ad ganizing an institute where neurolo\u00ad gists, neurosurgeons, and neuro\u00ad pathologists would work together with the kind of team work he had learned as football player and coach. Thinking he might be better able to realize this dream in Montreal, Canada, he joined the medical faculty of McGiIl Univer\u00ad sity in 1928 and became at the same time neurosurgeon at the Royal Vic\u00ad toria and Montreal General Hospitals. A few months after his arrival in Montreal, Penfield was called upon to remove a tumor from the brain of his sister Ruth. After finding that the tumor was malignant and far advanced, he performed a more radical operation than most neurosurgeons would have dared to attempt, but could not safely remove all of the malignant cells. Al\u00ad though the operation made it possible for his sister to enjoy a normal life WILDER PENFIELD 359 again, the symptoms eventually re\u00ad turned and she died three years later. The difficulties of his sister's case spurred him to make his first effort to realize his dream of an endowed neuro\u00ad logical institute for \"investigation of the brain and mind as a way to human bet\u00ad terment. \" His application to the Rocke\u00ad feller Foundation resulted in a grant of $1,232,000 and the opening in 1934 of the Montreal Institute of Neurology, whose fame in neurological research and treatment attracted observers and graduate students, as well as patients, from all over the world. In treating 1,132 patients during Penfield's directorship, the Institute greatly improved the techniques of brain surgery and added materially to neurological knowledge. Penfield him\u00ad self perfected the surgical operation for severe epilepsy and\u2014by observing di\u00ad rectly the living brain and mapping out its responses to electrical stimulation in the course of bringing therapeutic relief to conscious patients under local anes\u00ad thesia\u2014catalogued a great body of in\u00ad formation about the physiology of the brain and recorded observations \"of classical importance\" on the speech- cortex and the interpretative-cortex. \"distinguished contributions,\" his successor, William Feindel, said, were \"recognized as unique by his neuro\u00ad surgical and scientific colleagues.\" The eminent British neurologist Nobel Laureate Edgar Douglas Adrian de\u00ad scribed Penfield as \"a skilled neuro\u00ad surgeon, a distinguished scientist, and a clear and engaging writer\" with qual\u00ad ities of leadership which attracted \"de\u00ad voted colleagues,\" but that \"his first concern\" was always the patient who needed \"his surgical skill.\" Honors were bestowed on Penfield by societies, universities, and govern\u00ad ments in North America, Europe, and Asia. President of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and of the American Neurological Associa\u00ad tion, he was a fellow of the prestigious Royal Society of London and twenty- five other scientific and professional or\u00ad ganizations and a recipient of honorary degrees from as many universities, among them Princeton, Oxford, Mc- GiIl, and Montreal. He was also awarded half a dozen prizes here and abroad and was the first recipient of the $50,000 Royal Bank Centennial Award. Twice decorated by Canada, he was also awarded the United States Medal of Freedom, crosses of the French Legion of Honor and the Greek Legion of George I\u2014and the British Order of Merit, which is conferred on only twenty-four living persons. HIS SECOND CAREER Penfield retired from the McGiIl medical faculty in 1954, but he con\u00ad tinued to serve as director of the Neurological Institute and to lecture frequently. He visited Princeton in 1956 to deliver the Vanuxem lectures, later published by Princeton University Press as Speech and Brain Mecha\u00ad nisms. He also traveled to Russia, In\u00ad dia, and China in successive years as an invited lecturer before scientific groups. At the same time, he began a second career, as he completely re\u00ad wrote his late mother's novel, Story of Sari (based on a Biblical tale), which was published under the title No Other Gods. On his retirement as director of the Neurological Institute in 1960, he in\u00ad tensified work on his second career in line with his belief that \"rest, with nothing else, results in rust.\" That same year he published The Torch, a biographical novel about Hippocrates. Three years later, at age 72, he brought out The Second Career, a collection of essays and addresses reflecting his 360 RALPH BARTON PERRY myriad interests and encouraging others to use retirement for the devel\u00ad opment of a new career. In 1967, Penfield produced two more books: The Difficult Art of Giving, a biography of Alan Gregg, director of the medical sciences division of the Rockefeller Foundation, who had en\u00ad gineered the grant that had made the Montreal Neurological Institute possi\u00ad ble, and Man and His Family, which grew out of another facet of his second career\u2014his presidency of the Vanier Institute of the Family, which he helped found \"to promote and guide education in the home\u2014man's first classroom.\" In 1974, when he was eighty-three, he completed and dedicated to Sir Charles Sherrington, The Mystery of the Mind, an account for laymen of his investigation of the brain for almost forty years, published by Princeton University Press in 1975. Three weeks before his death at the age of eighty-five on April 5, 1976, Penfield completed the draft of his autobiography, No Man Alone, a phrase repeated frequently in the book to underline his emphasis on the team ap\u00ad proach to neurological research and treatment. Published in 1977, his final work was dedicated \"with affection and gratitude\" to the memory of his mother who had helped make it possible for him \"to see things as they were\" by preserving, editing, and typing the let\u00ad ters he had written her almost every week from 1909, when he entered Princeton, until her death in 1935. Perry, Ralph Barton (1876-1957), au\u00ad thor of a Pulitzer Prize-winning biog\u00ad raphy of William James, one-time pres\u00ad ident of the American Philosophical Association, and philosophy professor at Harvard for forty years, graduated from Princeton in 1896. He was later made an honorary member of the Class of 1896 at Harvard (as well as an honor\u00ad ary doctor of letters at both Princeton and Harvard). In 1941 he attended the forty-fifth reunion of both classes and gave the same talk at the two class din\u00ad ners. This talk, printed in the Princeton Alumni Weekly and the Harvard Alumni Bulletin and later published in a little book by the Vanguard Press of New York, decried the tendency of youth to shelve those past forty, and made a Plea for an Age Movement. Let us make virtue of our neces\u00ad sities [Perry counselled his Princeton and Harvard classmates]. Age should not have its face lifted, but rather teach the world to admire wrinkles, as the etchings of experience and the firm lines of character. Let us not suf\u00ad fer from insomnia, or regret the fact that we cannot sleep; but rather re\u00ad joice that we need not. . . . And when we are told that you cannot teach an old dog new tricks, our answer should be that old dogs have already learned their bagful, and may now practice the tricks they know. . . . There is a pride of youth, and I would not have it one whit abated. But there is also a pride of age, which is ours if we will only affirm it. . . . Peyton Hall, home of the Department of Astrophysical Sciences, was built in 1966 with grants from the National Sci\u00ad ence and Ford Foundations and other gifts and named for William Charles Peyton, father of Bernard Peyton '17 (chairman of the department's Advisory Council), who made the largest indi\u00ad vidual gift. With its neighbors, Fine Hall of Mathematics and Jadwin Physi-DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY 361 cal Laboratory, it stands just west of Palmer Stadium. Peyton Hall was de\u00ad signed by Minoru Yamasaki, who was also the architect of Woodrow Wilson Hall. The building contains a library, laboratories, faculty offices, lecture and seminar rooms, and two telescopes, one 9V2-inch and the other 4-inch, for student instruction. The smaller tele\u00ad scope belonged to William Charles Peyton, a life-long amateur student of astronomy. The department's facilities also in\u00ad clude a 36-inch reflecting telescope in the FitzRandolph Observatory east of Palmer Stadium. Phi Beta Kappa Society, founded at the College of William and Mary in 1776, has had a Princeton chapter since 1898. Membership is based on general aca\u00ad demic performance throughout the col\u00ad lege course; normally about a tenth of a class is elected. The society takes its name from the intitials of its Greek motto: Phihsophia Biou Kubernetes\u2014 \"Love of wisdom the Helmsman of Life.\" Two Princeton faculty members have served as president of the national or\u00ad ganization of Phi Beta Kappa: Dean Christian Gauss and Professor Whitney J. Oates. Philosophy, The Department of. The history of Princeton philosophy goes back to the College's earliest years, long before the present departmental structure was instituted in 1904. To be a philosopher in those days was compat\u00ad ible with being a theologian. It virtually always involved lecturing on ethics and political theory. And it often involved being president of the College. Presi\u00ad dent John Witherspoon, for example, listed as Professor of Theology, was fa\u00admous for his lectures on moral philoso\u00ad phy. A decade prior to Witherspoon, Princeton had as her president, for only a few weeks, one of the greatest phi\u00ad losophers America ever produced: Jonathan Edwards. Never mind the brevity of the period. It is a feather in Princeton's cap that she was able to lure such a giant, and a matter of great re\u00ad gret that his contribution was cut short by his premature death from smallpox. Witherspoon too was a giant, but in a different way. Edwards's philosophical ideas were stunningly original, though he used them in defense of Calvinistic doctrines that were rapidly losing favor. While not particularly original, With\u00ad erspoon was a man of unusual intellec\u00ad tual power. A disciple of Thomas Reid at Glasgow, he brought to Princeton Reid's \"Common Sense Realism,\" when he became president in 1768. James McCosh, who became president exactly one hundred years after With\u00ad erspoon, represented the same philos\u00ad ophy. Intellectual histories of the United States use the phrase \"The Princeton School\" to refer to the pow\u00ad erful point of view espoused by these two Scots. In the late nineteenth century and the early twentieth, philosophical academia was dominated by the Kantian-Hegelian point of view. Princeton philosophy finally joined in the Germanic chorus, contributing some important voices. Best known internationally was Norman Kemp- Smith, who came to Princeton in 1906. His commentary on Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, written while he was at Princeton, was studied wherever phi\u00ad losophy was taught. Archibald Bow\u00ad man, who joined the department in 1912, lectured on Hegel, as well as Plato. Like Kemp-Smith, he was a Scot; 362 DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY neither could resist the call homeward, Kemp-Smith to Edinburgh in 1919, Bowman to Glasgow in 1926. A third member of this group was Alexander T. Ormond, one of the first Stuart Profes\u00ad sors under McCosh, and the depart\u00ad ment's first chairman from 1904 to 1913. Still another was John Grier Hib- ben, a popular teacher and the last phi\u00ad losopher to be president of Princeton. Early in the twentieth century there were numerous signs of revolt from the predominant Kantian-Hegelian point of view. One movement, peculiarly American, was undertaken by six men who jointly published The New Realism in 1912. In various ways, four of the six were associated with Princeton. Two were among the five original \"precep\u00ad tor guys\" in philosophy, appointed by Woodrow Wilson in 1905: Edward G. Spaulding, who continued his service to Princeton for thirty-five years, and Walter T. Marvin, later dean at Rut\u00ad gers. The third was Ralph Barton Perry, professor at Harvard, who was a product of Princeton's Class of 1896. The fourth, Edwin B. Holt, a Harvard graduate and professor, was later, for a decade, visiting professor of psychology at Princeton. (Another original \"pre\u00ad ceptor guy\" in philosophy, Roger B.C. Johnson, served as departmental chairman from 1926 to 1934.) The new realism was but one straw in the wind. In America, the pragmatism of James and Dewey; in England, the realism of Moore and Russell; on the Continent, the so-called \"positivism\" of the Vienna Circle; all these were bom\u00ad barding the Hegelian citadel. The years preceding and immediately following the Second World War were crucial to the future of philosophy departments throughout the country. The bright young men were attracted to the vari\u00ad ous strands in the revolt. Some de\u00adpartments, where Hegelianism was so entrenched as to resist revolt, tended not to hire these younger men. Other departments, by emphasizing a single strand in the revolt, ran the risk of eventual narrowness in point of view. Fortunately, Princeton followed a mid\u00ad dle course in this difficult period of transition, under its chairman from 1934 to 1952, Robert M. Scoon. As a classical scholar he was committed to tradition; his sensitivity to new trends was evident in his admiration of Dew\u00ad ey's pragmatism. The department did not flourish during his chairmanship, but it followed a sensible and even course that paved the way for the fu\u00ad ture. The key to this period was Scoon's favorite word: \"balance.\" The towering figure through these years was Walter T. Stace (q.v.), who taught theory of knowledge and metaphysics; many of the best known philosophers in the United States in the 1970s were products of his teaching. Scoon taught Plato and Aristotle, and also Aquinas until the appointment in 1948 of the eminent French philoso\u00ad pher, Jacques Maritain (q.v.). For forty-three years Ledger Wood upheld the tradition of scholarly competence in the history of modern philosophy. Spaulding kept alive philosophy's con\u00ad tact with the natural sciences. Theo\u00ad dore M. Greene vigorously repre\u00ad sented philosophy's contact with the arts and humanities. Throughout the forties, the appoint\u00ad ment of younger men was always made with an eye on balance. One of them, Walter Kaufmann, appointed in 1947 to teach modern European philosophy, achieved world-wide recognition in his field. But the forties brought losses with Spaulding's death in 1940 and Greene's resignation in 1945; and so did the fifties with Maritain's retire-DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS 363 ment in 1952 and both Scoon's and Stace's in 1955. It was clear that the fu\u00ad ture of the department depended on a series of major appointments. In 1955, Carl G. Hempel, one of the most eminent men in philosophy of sci\u00ad ence and theory of knowledge, was lured from Yale. In the same year, Gregory Vlastos, possibly the leading scholar of classical philosophy in this country, was called from Cornell. In 1963, Stuart Hampshire, one of Eng\u00ad land's foremost philosophers, came from the University of London. In 1967, Donald Davidson, whose work in ethics and the philosophy of language was becoming proverbial, came from Stanford. And, finally, Dana Scott was brought in 1969 to contribute distinc\u00ad tion in the area of logic. It is little wonder that, by 1969, in a survey conducted by the American Council on Education, Princeton's Phi\u00ad losophy Department was ranked first in the nation in both quality of faculty and effectiveness of doctoral program. The department's continuing distinc\u00ad tion has not rested solely on the emi\u00ad nent philosophers just mentioned. For one thing, not all remained. Hampshire left after seven years to become War\u00ad den of Wadham College, Oxford. Davidson left after three years to accept a post at Rockefeller University. Scott left after only two years to become a University Professor at Oxford. Much of the strength of any department lies in its younger members, and much of Princeton's strength in philosophy lies not only in the ability of these younger scholars but also in the breadth of their interests. As of 1977, tenured members of the department, by order of date of first appointment, were as follows: James Ward Smith, Political Philosophy; Wal\u00ad ter Kaufmann, History of Philosophy; Arthur Szathmary, Philosophy of Art; George Pitcher, Theory of Paul Philosophy of History of Philosophy; Da\u00ad vid Lewis, Metaphysics; Richard C. Jeffrey, Philosophy of Science; Michael Frede, Classical Philosophy; Saul Kripke, Logic and Metaphysics. James Ward Smith Physics, The Department of. Was it good advice or inspiration that prompted the trustees of the College of New Jersey to appoint Joseph Henry (q.v.) to the Professorship of Natural Philosophy in 1832? Whichever it was, they appointed the greatest, perhaps the only, American research physicist of his time. Henry was the only American whose name was adopted for one of the principal inter\u00ad national electrical units. Moreover, he was a great teacher, first exemplifying in physics the Princeton ideal of the teacher-scholar. After Henry's departure in 1848 to become the first head of the Smithso\u00ad nian Institution, physics at Princeton had an arid period until the appoint\u00ad ment of Cyrus Fogg Brackett (q.v.) in 1873 and of William (q.v.) in 1882. Both men brought dis\u00ad tinction to the teaching of physics and prepared the way for the transition into a great department. In the 1890s they, with Henry B. Fine (q.v.), concluded that both mathematics and physics had to be strengthened if Princeton was to become a real university. Con\u00ad sequently, they began, under Wood- row Wilson, to build up both depart-364 DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS ments by appointing promising young men. In 1905 and 1906, the trustees brought to Princeton two brilliant young Englishmen, James H. Jeans in applied mathematics and Owen W. Richardson in physics. At that time there was no Palmer Laboratory and physics lectures were given in the old John C. Green School of Science. Richardson described the research fa\u00ad cilities he found there in a letter writ\u00ad ten nearly fifty years later: I remember getting quite a shock when I was first introduced to the part where I was expected to set up a research laboratory. This was a kind of dark basement, ventilated by a hole in the wall, apparently acciden\u00ad tal in origin, and inhabited by an im\u00ad pressive colony of hoptoads which enjoyed the use of a swimming pool in one corner. However, with the help of the Clerk of Works these vis\u00ad itors and their amenities were got rid of and a lot of good work was done in it. Looking back on those days, I think they were in many ways the most satisfactory of my life. Professor Richardson lived up to his high reputation, and when he went back to England in 1914, he left an en\u00ad thusiasm for research which has never faltered to this day. The quality of the training under him and his successors is evidenced by the Nobel laureates (q.v.) who have been members of the faculty or graduate students. In the chronological order of their awards they are: Arthur H. Compton, Owen W. Richardson, Clinton J. Davisson, Edwin M. McMillan, John Bardeen, Robert Hofstadter, Eugene P. Wigner, Richard P. Feynman, Philip W. Anderson. Bardeen is the only person who has ever received the physics prize twice. Wigner is also a recipient of the Fermi Prize and the Atoms for Peace Award. William F. Magie was chairman of the department from 1908 to 1929. He was a man of firm character but gentle manners, and the influence of his per\u00ad sonality on the department still en\u00ad dures. He was blessed with a wife of equally strong personality and a quick wit. She was the source of the often quoted aphorism \"A physicist is a man who knows what is wrong with the elec\u00ad tric bell but can't fix it,\" and also of the answer to Professor Cooke's hope that his son would become a scientist: \"Oh no, Lester, think of the scientists you know.\" The expansion of the department under Dean Magie included the ap\u00ad pointment in 1925 of four new assistant professors, Henry D. Smyth, Allen G. Shenstone, Louis A. Turner, and Charles Zahn. Smyth became well known as the author of Atomic Energy for Military Purposes (the \"Smyth Re\u00ad port\"). For his service as the United States representative, with rank of am\u00ad bassador, on the International Atomic Energy Agency he was given the Atoms for Peace Award. Smyth and Shenstone, between them, served for 25 years as chairmen of the depart\u00ad ment. Following those appointments came several in the field of theoretical physics, notably Eugene P. Wigner and John von Neumann, the first of the re\u00ad markable group of Hungarians whose effect on physics in the United States has been so very great. With that start, the field of theory became more and more important in the University. The combination of the Institute for Ad\u00ad vanced Study and the University made the town of Princeton, at one time, the greatest center for theoretical physics in the world. In the thirties, Princeton became DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS 365 part of the nuclear age when Milton G. White was brought to the department and the decision was made to build a cyclotron. Such a decision was much more difficult to make then than now. No government grants were then avail\u00ad able, and the University and the de\u00ad partment had to find the necessary support from the University Scientific Research Fund. To save money, the machine had to be built in Palmer Lab\u00ad oratory, and the only room large enough was the ventilating room in the basement, which had not been in more than partial use for some time. The cyclotron, until the acquisition of the 3 Rev accelerator in the late fifties, was the most important single piece of ap\u00ad paratus in the department's history. The years of World War II found most of the physics faculty engaged in war research either in Princeton or at some national laboratory. A consider\u00ad able number went to the new Radia\u00ad tion Laboratory at M.I.T., which was founded to exploit the magnetron, the short wave transmitter tube invented in England. Professors White and Turner headed large sections of that very im\u00ad portant laboratory. Other faculty mem\u00ad bers were involved in the highly secret atomic bomb development, especially Professor Wigner, whose theoretical and practical abilities were of the greatest importance. Despite a de\u00ad creased physics faculty, teaching of physics had to be expanded to include all the servicemen being trained at Princeton. This was accomplished by bringing in from other sources every available teacher who could master enough elementary physics to keep one step ahead of the students. A teaching force of over seventy was assembled in that way. The period between 1945, when the department started to renew itself, and the 1970s was one of continuous expan\u00adsion in many directions. That was the era of enormous support of fundamen\u00ad tal research by various government agencies. Princeton received grants in many fields, involving many millions of dollars. The largest acquisition was the 3 Rev accelerator. That kind of affluence for depart\u00ad ments of physics is now much reduced, so that many physicists are turning to\u00ad wards other fields of research, such as biophysics or astrophysics. Theoretical work is much less affected than is ex\u00ad perimental, and Princeton, with its ex\u00ad tremely powerful theoretical group, is in an excellent position. The transformation of Princeton from a college to a university required an in\u00ad creasing emphasis on research and therefore on the assessment of every new faculty member as a research scholar as well as a qualified teacher. It might seem that the emphasis on re\u00ad search could militate against the teach\u00ad ing of undergraduates. That is not in general true in Princeton and particu\u00ad larly in an advancing science such as physics, where an understanding of the philosophy of modern research is necessary even in the teaching of elementary physics; and the upperclass courses would lack all vitality if they were not under the influence of a re\u00ad search faculty. Even the most research-minded faculty members teach not only advanced courses but the highly important elementary courses as well. John A. Wheeler, one of the department's most eminent pro\u00ad fessors of theoretical physics, lectured in the largest freshman course for five years and found it so exhilarating that he was loath to give it up. The teacher-scholar tradition, initi\u00ad ated by Joseph Henry and later devel\u00ad oped by Rrackett, Magie, and their successors, is now carried on by a de\u00ad partment of physics that has grown to 366 PLASMA PHYSICS LABORATORY about sixty faculty members with twenty teaching assistants and over a hundred graduate students. Nor has size diminished the quality of the fac\u00ad ulty. In fact it has frequently been said that it is one of the best departments, if not even the best, in the country. The contrast between the faculties of 1905 and the present day is equalled by the improvement of physical facilities. Instead of the \"dark basement,\" the department enjoyed sixty years of that magnificent building, Palmer Labora\u00ad tory. In 1970 the faculty's size and the increased room needed for research compelled the two departments, math\u00ad ematics and physics (which have always had a close relationship and had to re\u00ad main together), to move into the new complex of buildings comprising the new Fine Hall and Jadwin Hall (qq.v.). Here the two departments live in amity separated only by their joint library. Allen G. Shenstone Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPL), The, was founded in 1951 by Lyman Spitzer, Jr., chairman of the Astronomy Department. As an astrophysicist, Spitzer had studied the behavior of ionized gases, or plasmas, in interstel\u00ad lar space. Inspired by the hope of find\u00ad ing a new source of power for peaceful applications, he conceived the idea of confining a plasma in a figure-8 shaped tube using magnetic forces generated by coils wrapped around the outside. Spitzer reasoned that, at sufficiently high temperature, the nuclear particles in a plasma so contained would undergo fusion and release energy. Because only very low density plasma could be contained in this way, there would be no possibility of explosion. Spitzer called his concept \"the stel\u00ad larator,\" and took it to the United States Atomic Energy Commission on May 11, 1951. A contract was soon writ\u00ad ten, and work was begun at the Univer\u00ad sity's newly acquired Forrestal Re\u00ad search Center. The code name Project Matterhorn was used to designate the stellarator program and, for a short time at the beginning, other classified work. Theoretical work was supple\u00ad mented by experiments, and over a pe\u00ad riod of twenty years, a series of re\u00ad search devices of progressively larger size bore such names as Model A, B-3, Model C, Spherator, and FM-I. Meanwhile, in 1958, fusion work had been declassified. Graduate instruction in plasma physics was immediately in\u00ad troduced, graduate students made their appearance at Project Matterhorn, and in 1961, the name Plasma Physics Lab\u00ad oratory was adopted. The same year, Melvin B. Gottlieb succeeded Spitzer as Director of the laboratory. Magnetic confinement proved to be subject to a bewildering variety of in\u00ad stabilities which theoreticians, ex\u00ad perimentalists, and engineers attacked one by one. Late in the 1950s the figure-8 geometry was abandoned in favor of the \"racetrack,\" and this in turn gave way in 1970 to the \"tokamak,\" a Russian design closely related to the stellarator concept. Princeton's Sym\u00ad metric Tokamak (1970-1974) achieved the same greatly improved plasma con\u00ad finement previously reported by the Russians. It was followed by the Adiabatic Thoroidal Compressor (1972- 1976), which investigated new heating methods and reached an electron tem\u00ad perature of 22,000,0000C, and the $14,000,000 Princeton Large Torus (1975- ) designed for the scaling of results to larger size. Other facilities projected are the $18,000,000 Poloidal Divertor Experiment (1978), dedicated to controlling the level of plasma im-THE POE BROTHERS 367 purities and the $228,000,000 Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (1981), which should actually produce short bursts of fusion energy for test purposes. By 1976 the number of employees had increased to 800 and the annual operating budget was approximately $28,000,000. Earl C. Tanner Playing fields within easy reach of dor\u00ad mitories have long been a special fea\u00ad ture of Princeton undergraduate life. They have increased in number with the growth of student enrollment and moved southward and eastward as new dormitories were erected. Among the first were Brokaw Field (1893) in mem\u00ad ory of Frederick Brokaw 1892; Goldie Field (1912) in honor of George Goldie, first coach of gymnastics and track; and Poe Field (1916) named for John Pren\u00ad tiss Poe 1895, a football hero who was killed in France in 1915 while serving with the Black Watch. Other fields have been named for Paul Bedford 1897, charter trustee; Tyler Campbell '43, lacrosse star who died in World War II; William J. Clarke, who coached thirty- four varsity baseball teams; the Class of John Kelley Strubing '20, a baseball star. Poe Brothers, The, contributed to many Princeton football victories in the twenty years beginning in 1882 and were the special nemesis of Harvard and Yale. There were six of them, sons of John Prentiss Poe 1854, attorney general of Maryland (and a cousin of the writer Edgar Allan Poe) who sent them to his Alma Mater, as he put it, \"from a full paternal quiver.\" They were all short and stocky, strong, and fast: (1) Samuel Johnson Poe 1884, the eldest, played halfback in 1882 and 1883, and was also a lacrosse Ail- American. (2) Edgar Allan Poe 1891 was quar\u00ad terback and captain in his junior and senior years. In 1889, the year he was named Ail-American, he played a lead\u00ad ing part in the 41 to 15 defeat of Har\u00ad vard at Cambridge. During the excite\u00ad ment, a Harvard man asked a Princeton alumnus whether Poe was related to the great Edgar Allan Poe; the alumnus looked at him in astonishment and re\u00ad plied, \"He is the great Edgar Allan Poe.\" He graduated Phi Beta Kappa and became, like his father, attorney general of Maryland. (3) John Prentiss Poe, Jr., 1895 had a reckless courage and a generous nature that endeared him to his contem\u00ad poraries. His freshman year he was a star halfback on the varsity and class president. That spring, when he was required to withdraw from college for scholastic reasons, his whole class turned out at the Junction to see him off. He was readmitted in the fall, and played even more brilliantly. Later that year, again in academic arrears, he was obliged to leave, this time for good. For a time he coached football at other col\u00ad leges, and then embarked on an adven\u00ad turous career as cowpuncher, gold prospector, surveyor, and soldier of for\u00ad tune. When World War I broke out he hastened to England and \"took the King's shilling\" as a private in the Royal Garrison Artillery. He later applied for transfer to the infantry and was as\u00ad signed to the 1st Black Watch. He was killed in action in France on September 25, 1915. A portrait, showing his stocky figure with the kilts and bonnet of the 368 POE BROTHERS Black Watch, hangs in Madison Hall; it was given by the Princeton Alumni As\u00ad sociation of Maryland. Poe Field, pro\u00ad vided in his memory by classmates and friends, is used for lacrosse and in\u00ad tramural athletics. The John Prentiss Poe Football Cup, given by his mother, is awarded annually to that member of the varsity football team who has best exemplified courage, modesty, perse\u00ad verance, and good sportsmanship. It is Princeton's highest football award. (4) Neilson (Net) Poe 1897 played in the backfield in 1895 and 1896 and re\u00ad turned to coach in later years. He served overseas with the A.E.F. in World War I and was awarded the Dis\u00ad tinguished Service Cross for gallantry in action. For twenty years between the World Wars, he was in charge of the scrubs, who were called Poe's \"Ome\u00ad lettes\" because \"they were good eggs who were beaten up.\" For another twenty years he maintained a close association with coaches and players, watching the daily practices and travel\u00ad ing with the team for its games away. Courteous and light-hearted, he was well liked by everyone who knew him. (5) Arthur Poe '00, another All- American, made the decisive score that beat Yale in two successive years. In 1898 he ran ninety yards for a touch\u00ad down and the only score of the game. Newspapers reported that he had re\u00ad covered a Yale fumble, but Poe said that he had grabbed the ball from a Yale halfback's arms, that he had a clear field and a ten-yard start for the goal line, and that he had never felt happier in his life. In the 1899 game, with less than a minute to play, and with the score 10 to 6 in Yale's favor, Bill Roper '02 of Princeton recovered a fumble on Yale's 30-yard line. It was getting dark and time was running out. The only feasible strategy was to try for a field goal, then worth 5 points, but Princeton's two drop-kickers were out with injuries. Ar\u00ad thur Poe volunteered to try a drop-kick even though he had never kicked in a college game before. The others agreed, Poe dropped back to the 35- yard line, and (the newspapers said) made a perfect dropkick. Poe's version was different: The pass from center came back per\u00ad fectly which is more than anyone could truthfully say for the rest of the play. . . . The ball bounded a little too high off the ground as I dropped it and I got under it too much, raising it high into the air almost like a punt. It came down just about a foot over the crossbar and about a yard inside the upright. I wasn't sure it was good until I turned to the referee and saw him raise his arms and heard him say \"goal.\" . . . Then everything broke loose. . . . All I remember after that was being seized by a crowd of un\u00ad dergraduates and alumni who rushed out onto the field, and hearing my brother Net shout: \"You damned lucky kid, you have licked them again.\" (6) Gresham Poe '02 was first men\u00ad tioned with his brothers in verses, ascribed to Booth Tarkington 1893, which were read at a victory celebra\u00ad tion in 1899. Eli Yale is addressing the Tiger: \"Sir, I said, \"All Poes are gone\u2014 Johnson, Edgar, Neilson, John; Arthur with the toe on which Winning goals are kicked galore. Tell me, tell me, gentle Tiger, Is it possible there are more?\" \"Stop!\" the Tiger cried, \"there's Gresham, Getting ready to refresh 'em\u2014 Don't forget him, I implore.\" POLER'S RECESS 369 As it turned out, Gresham spent most of his time on the bench as a sub\u00ad stitute quarterback, but he did get into the Yale game his senior year. He was sent in with other substitutes in the fourth quarter when Yale was leading 12 to 0. The Princeton fans had practi\u00ad cally conceded victory to Yale, but when Gresham appeared on the field they rose to their feet with a rousing cheer\u2014such was the magic of the name \"Poe.\" They rose again with a roar when Gresham received a punt and squirmed 23 yards before he was downed. \"Poe's presence seemed to re\u00ad juvenate the Tigers,\" Harper's Weekly reported, \"and for the last ten minutes of the contest they fairly outplayed the weary Elis. The ball was twice carried half the length of the field, but the whistle blew before Princeton could score.\" Poler's Recess, a ten-minute break in cramming for exams, was a Princeton custom noisily observed from the turn of the century almost up to the Second World War. The recess occurred every night during the final examination peri\u00ad od. As soon as the nine o'clock bell began to ring, all windows on campus were opened and all means employed to produce a din that would divert the most diligent poler from his work. (\"Poler\" was an old Princeton syno\u00ad nym for \"grind.\")* Firecrackers were exploded, pistols, revolvers, and shot\u00ad guns fired with blank cartridges, horns blown, drums and tin pans beaten. As an undergraduate writer observed in 1918, it was \"probably the most juvenile\" of all campus customs, but it brought \"a welcome break for everyone in a long night's hard work.\" Poler's Recess was revived after World War II in response to the urging of a young alumnus in a letter to the Princetonian of January 20, 1949. He proposed that beginning at 11 p.m. (rather than at 9, so as not to disturb those taking evening exams), with the cry of \"Take ten,\" ten minutes be given over to total pandemonium, and that thereafter absolute silence should pre\u00ad vail. In the same issue of the Prince, \"Examinitus\" reported that local doc\u00ad tors thought the break would relieve tensions and heighten morale and probably raise each student's marks from one to three grades. He quoted \"a prominent psychologist\" as saying: \"The break will be of incalculable aid to all those suffering from mental blocks, hallucinations, paranoia, schizophre\u00ad nia, psychosis, neurosis, and blocking of the digestive tract.\" That night undergraduates re\u00ad sponded enthusiastically, and the next morning the Princetonian pronounced the revival an unqualified success, awarding championship honors to Holder Court, where students staged a mock battle with blank cartridges and flaming tennis balls and \"let the entire borough know they had discarded their books.\" But observance of the \"11 p.m. catharsis\" was sporadic the next year or two and then faded out. Fairly typi\u00ad cal was the reaction of one under\u00ad graduate who told the Prince that he had enough interruptions already, what with listening to the evening news and then \"taking time out for milk, sandwiches, ice cream (and pie).\" * B. H. Hall, in College Words and Customs (1851), records that at Princeton, and also at Union College, \"poler\" meant one who studies hard, and he suggests that the meaning was de\u00ad rived by analogy from the laborious poling of a boat. 370 DEPARTMENT OF POLITICS Politics, The Department of. Although politics did not come into being as a separate department until 1924, the teaching of this subject at Princeton goes back to the early days of the Col\u00ad lege of New Jersey. We are told that one of the reasons the \"Father of the Constitution,\" James Madison, chose Princeton rather than the College of William and Mary was the fact that Witherspoon, the only clergyman to sign the Declaration of Independence, \"extended his course in moral philoso\u00ad phy to include the general principles of public law and politics.\" The first course labeled Political Sci\u00ad ence was introduced in 1871 and taught by Lyman H. Atwater. William M. Sloane, taking over Atwater's work in 1883, offered upperclass courses in the philosophy of history and political sci\u00ad ence, and graduate work in history. The next year Alexander Johnson gave courses in jurisprudence, political economy, and public and international law. English common law was available as a graduate course. When Woodrow Wilson joined the faculty in 1890 to fill the vacancy caused by Professor Johnson's death, the cur\u00ad riculum in political studies was exten\u00ad sive. By 1896, the overall Department of Philosophy included history and political science under Sloane, juris\u00ad prudence under Wilson, and political economy under Winthrop More Daniels, who had come to assist Wilson in 1892. In 1898, history and political science became simply history, and Daniels entitled his field \"political economy and sociology.\" In 1903-1904, as part of a general reorganization of the curriculum into eleven departments, History, Politics, and Economics were \"reassembled\" as a single department. On President Wilson's insistence, the name \"Politics\" replaced Political Sci\u00adence, and so it has since remained. Beginning in 1905, the influx of Pres\u00ad ident Wilson's \"preceptor guys\" began. Notable additions in Politics were Edward S. Corwin (q.v.), Charles H. Mcllwain, and William Starr Myers, all trained historians. In 1913, when the centrifugal forces of specialization again asserted themselves, History and Poli\u00ad tics, and Economics and Social Institu\u00ad tions became two separate depart\u00ad ments. Politics broke off in 1924, with Edward S. Corwin, McCormick Profes\u00ad sor of Jurisprudence since 1918, as chairman. Having neither taste nor ap\u00ad titude for administration, Corwin dele\u00ad gated departmental detail to his former student and colleague, William Seal Carpenter, who succeeded him as chairman in 1936. Corwin stands among the giants of American constitutional commen\u00ad tators\u2014with Kent, Story, and Cooley. More than any other scholar of our time, he justified and illustrated his own incisive observation: \"If judges make law, so do commentators.\" He was one of the few American scholars honored at the Harvard Tercentenary in 1936. From 1925 until the end of World War II, graduate study in politics at Princeton meant primarily work with Corwin. During this period graduate students, though small in number, were high in quality: Raymond Leslie Buell, Robert J. Harris, Donald Morri\u00ad son, John Masland, Clinton Rossiter, and Alpheus Thomas Mason. Best known as a judicial biographer and stu\u00ad dent of American political thought, Mason succeeded Corwin as McCor\u00ad mick Professor of Jurisprudence in 1947. At the undergraduate level, Corwin's course \"Con Interp,\" featur\u00ad ing source material and requiring writ\u00ad ten \"opinions\" in cases currently pend-DEPARTMENT OF POLITICS 371 ing in the High Court, enjoyed the reputation of being the toughest one in the University. Then, as now, seniors also voted it \"the most valuable.\" Until the 1930s the political orienta\u00ad tion of the department was predomi\u00ad nantly Republican, none more ardent than Professor William Starr Myers. Al\u00ad though a fervent admirer of Woodrow Wilson as a teacher, he voted the straight Republican ticket. Author of a history of the Republican party, his hero was Herbert Hoover. Myers's un\u00ad dergraduate lectures, highlighting per\u00ad sonal contacts with political bigwigs, were the subject of a favorite faculty song: Here's to Myers, William Starr, Thinks he sees very far. All the Presidents he knows by sight, Imagines they're saying, \"Myers, you're right.\" Myers, a southern gentleman of rare charm, took typical undergraduate jest in stride and went right on taking stu\u00ad dents into his confidence concerning his close ties with \"great men\" in American politics. The department's most conspicuous non-conformist was Walter Lincoln Whittlesey. In more recent years H. H. Wilson played, at a higher level, a role not unlike that of Whittlesey. For un\u00ad dergraduates he has created an intellec\u00ad tual ferment, prodding them to think seriously about economic, social, and political inequities. More recently, another dissenter, international law professor Richard FaIk, has served as a catalyst, provoking colleagues, stu\u00ad dents, and the country to question the tragedy of Viet Nam, long before it was popular to do so. \"Princeton in the nation's service\" under the auspices of the Politics De\u00adpartment took a practical turn in 1930 with the establishment of the School of Public and International Affairs, headed by Harold W. Dodds (later president of the University), and the Princeton Survey in State and Local Government under the direction of John F. Sly. In 1932, Harwood L. Childs came to Princeton to teach and research public opinion, then an un\u00ad charted academic field. Childs founded and edited the Public Opinion Quar\u00ad terly, which in a relatively short time became one of the most prestigious journals in the field of politics. With his colleague, international law specialist John B. Whitton, Childs co-authored propaganda abroad by short wave pro\u00ad grams during World War II. During the war members of the de\u00ad partment were especially conspicuous in the nation's service. Harold Sprout, who had come to Princeton in 1931, published The Rise of American Naval Power (1943). A pioneering work in a burgeoning field, this book, co- authored by Margaret Sprout, quickly established this husband and wife re\u00ad search and writing team as leading au\u00ad thorities. Sprout served as a Washing\u00ad ton consultant for various U.S. depart\u00ad ments including State, War, and Navy. From 1943 to 1945, he was a member of the staff of OWI, helping to develop propaganda material toward enemy powers. George A. Graham joined the de\u00ad partment as part of the drive that began in the 1930s to expand the curriculum to include public affairs, domestic and international. A specialist in public ad\u00ad ministration, Graham was in Washing\u00ad ton throughout World War II with the U.S. Bureau of the Budget. After the war, he was on call as staff director of the Hoover Commission on Organiza\u00ad tion of the Executive Branch and con-372 DEPARTMENT OF POLITICS sultant in 1951 to the Senate Subcom\u00ad mittee on Ethics in Government. Meanwhile, members of the depart\u00ad ment were active in New Jersey state politics and administration. In 1932, a team of twenty-one members of the Princeton faculty (seven drawn from Politics), under the direction of Profes\u00ad sor Harold W. Dodds, made a com\u00ad prehensive survey of the government of New Jersey with a view to recommend\u00ad ing economies without impairing essen\u00ad tial services. Also serving New Jersey were John F. Sly, chairman of the New Jersey Commission on State Tax Policy, and William S. Carpenter, president of the New Jersey Civil Service Commis\u00ad sion. Sly made his mark as a consultant in state and local government through\u00ad out the country. His successor, Duane Lockard, a productive scholar no less pragmatic than Sly, brought to his work a liberating humanism. In 1969, when faculty-student rela\u00ad tions reached a crisis stage, it seemed fitting that President Robert Goheen should have asked Professor Stanley Kelley, Jr., to chair a special student- faculty committee to study the adminis\u00ad trative structure of the University and recommend alternatives on matters of concern to both faculty and students. For better or for worse, the guiding hand in reorganizing the University as it operates today was that of Kelley, an expert on political parties and campaign techniques. After 1950, Politics at Princeton moved increasingly toward the scien\u00ad tific approach, toward behaviorism and quantitative analysis, toward compara\u00ad tive study of foreign systems and inter\u00ad national relations. Without breaking completely with the Wilson-Corwin- Mason historical tradition, even \"Con Interp,\" under the direction of Walter F. Murphy, fifth McCormick Professor of Jurisprudence, succumbed to the quantitative and comparative approach. Murphy's Elements of Judicial Strategy broke fresh ground, not only at Princeton but in the study of constitu\u00ad tional interpretation generally. By the 1960s personnel and offerings encompassed the whole range of poli\u00ad tics, domestic and foreign. Professors Robert Tucker and Stephen Cohen specialize in Soviet affairs, Henry Bienen on sub-Sahara Africa, Manfred Halpern on the Middle East, Edward Taft on the American political system. Robert Gilpin explores the impact of science on international relations. Herman Somers, concentrating on wel\u00ad fare systems, helped draft the medicare program. Political theory, once a neg\u00ad lected area, is now represented by Sheldon Wolin, Dennis Thompson, and Paul Sigmund. At long last the presidency is accorded its due under the leadership of a relative newcomer, Fred Greenstein. Researching a wide range of domestic problems and issues, including ecology, Gerald Garvey brings to each one bold and imaginative dimensions. Long before co-education at the un\u00ad dergraduate level became an irresisti\u00ad ble demand, the Politics Department, following the lead of Oriental Lan\u00ad guages, had broken the sex barrier by enrolling women in the Graduate School. Politics was also among the first to admit blacks for graduate study. In due course, the democratic prin\u00ad ciple also triumphed in the administra\u00ad tion of departmental affairs. The de\u00ad partment learned from experience what might have been gleaned from books\u2014 \"Power tends to corrupt.\" The first two chairmen, Corwin and Carpenter, car\u00ad ried on 22 years. Finally the affairs of the department, concentrated in the hands of the chairman, became so ty-OFFICE OF POPULATION RESEARCH 373 ranically administered as to drive Ma\u00ad son, Graham, and Sprout to assert the right of revolution, forcing Carpenter's resignation. The coup d'etat was fol\u00ad lowed by adoption of a constitution which provided, among other things, for a rotating chairmanship: George A. Graham, 1946-1949; Harold Sprout, 1949-1952; George Graham, 1955; John F. 1955-1959; William M. Beaney, 1959-1961; Marver H. Bernstein, 1961-1963; Stanley F. KeI- ley, Jr., 1963-1966; Walter M. Mur\u00ad phy, 1966-1969; Duane F. Lockard, 1969-1972; Dennis W. Thompson, Acting Chairman, 1972-1973; Henry Bienen, 1973-1976. From the beginning of its history, Princeton has appreciated the educa\u00ad tional requirements of a free society. For their day, to some extent in ours, Witherspoon and Madison supplied the model. Reflected in the offerings, under the rubric politics, is recognition of the citizen's need to understand not only the organization, operation, and functions of government but also the problems of industry, commerce, fi\u00ad nance, and international relations. The student should learn about people as well as things. \"Moral philosophy\" is as basic now as in the time of John With\u00ad erspoon and James Madison. By the diversity of its instructors and program, as well as its ecumenical approach, the Politics Department continues to main\u00ad tain Woodrow Wilson's ideal of Prince\u00ad ton in the nation's service. Alpheus Thomas Mason Population Research, The Office of, was founded in 1936 when Frederick H. Osborn '10, a charter trustee of Princeton, formerly a trustee at the Milbank Memorial Fund, used his good offices with both of these institutions to persuade the University to found a pro\u00ad gram in teaching and research in popu\u00ad lation, and the Milbank Fund to pro\u00ad vide much of the initial financing. Osborn, later a major general during World War II, appointed to study and foster improvement in the morale of the armed services, had a deep interest in population matters, as well as in his alma mater. As part of the arrangement between the Milbank Fund and Princeton, Frank Notestein, a demog\u00ad rapher then on the staff of the Fund, was appointed to the Princeton faculty, and became the first director of the Office of Population Research. He served until 1959 when he resigned to become president of the Population Council of New York; he was succeeded as director by Ansley J. Coale, and on Coale's resignation as director in 1976, by Charles F. Westoff. Princeton's venture in demography was a pioneering one. Its program in population studies was the first uni\u00ad versity-centered combination of re\u00ad search and teaching in the field in the United States. The Office was also an innovator in what was then an all-male institution in the appointment, shortly after the Office was founded, of Dr. Irene Barnes Taeuber as a member of its research staff. Dr. Taeuber, who died in 1974, published nineteen vol\u00ad umes of books and research papers preeminently on the population of Ja\u00ad pan, and also on population in the United States, Europe, Africa, and South Asia. Before World War II, decades before the population explosion became a mat\u00ad ter of general concern, Notestein and Taeuber called attention to the pro\u00ad spective acceleration in population growth in the poorer, densely settled areas of the world. Alumni of the Graduate School with degrees in eco-374 PRECEPTORIAL METHOD nomics, sociology, and statistics who have learned population at Princeton now teach at Princeton, Harvard, Michigan, Johns Hopkins, and Wiscon\u00ad sin, among many others. Nearly 100 foreign students from more than thirty countries have had special training in population at the Office of Population Research. They are employed in the Population Division of the United Na\u00ad tions, at the World Bank, and in many universities and ministries in develop\u00ad ing countries. AnsleyJ. Coale Preceptorial method, introduced in 1905 under Woodrow Wilson's leader\u00ad ship, is a method of study whereby a small group of students meets in regu\u00ad lar conferences with a faculty member. Wilson first described his proposal as a modified form of the Oxford tutorial that would \"import into the great uni\u00ad versity the methods and personal con\u00ad tact between teacher and pupil which are characteristic of the small college, and so gain the advantages of both.\" Disclaiming novelty in the concept, Wilson stated that the preceptorial would not only supersede the old- fashioned recitation but also \"give the undergraduates their proper release from being school boys.\" The subject matter was not to be \"the lectures of their professors or the handful of text books . . . but the reading which they should do for themselves.\" The use of the term \"preceptor\" seems to have been proposed by Wilson himself; and the title was established by the trustees in June of 1905, when forty-five men were appointed precep\u00ad tors with the rank of assistant profes\u00ad sors. * Twelve were already members of the faculty; the thirty-three others came from many other campuses across the country. Two more were added in October, and others were appointed in subsequent years, but Wilson's initial goal of fifty is recorded in the students' Faculty Song; Here's to those preceptor guys, Fifty stiffs to make us wise. The new appointments were made in the humanities and social sciences, and also in mathematics; none was made in the \"laboratory departments\" where, Wilson noted, \"direct personal contact between teacher and pupil has long been a matter-of-course method of in\u00ad struction.\" Wilson interviewed each candidate he did not know, and the extraordi\u00ad nary group of teachers he enlisted in a three-month period is one of the re\u00ad markable feats in American higher edu\u00ad cation. His instinct was to place teach\u00ad ing ability ahead of scholarly qualifica\u00ad tions, yet many of the preceptors gained distinction as scholars, some as administrators, among them Edward S. Corwin, Luther P. Eisenhart, Christian Gauss, Charles H. Mcllwain, Charles G. Osgood, Robert K. Root, and Os\u00ad wald Veblen. The original concept was that of a group tutorial. In his junior year each undergraduate was assigned a pre\u00ad ceptor to \"be his guide in all the read\u00ad ing and work of the Department.\" As far as possible students continued with the same preceptors for all courses. Lectures were to be complementary to the reading. Students were to be grouped by \"aptitudes, training, tastes, and acquirements,\" abler students being \"excused from the ordinary weekly con\u00ad ferences\" and encouraged to read inde\u00ad pendently. Thus Wilson had already envisioned something like the \"four-PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 375 course plan\" of independent study es\u00ad tablished twenty years later. The new plan brought immediate and far-reaching results. Reporting to the Trustees in December 1905, Wil\u00ad son asserted that the method \"has affected the habits of the University al\u00ad most as much as if it were an ancient in\u00ad stitution.\" The Nassau Literary Maga\u00ad zine declared that it was \"generally, even universally, popular.\" Comments in the press were favorable, and the American educational world watched with interest. Despite its success the new method brought problems. Wilson had pro\u00ad ceeded without the funds required for a greatly enlarged faculty, and the result\u00ad ing deficit soon came to about $100,000 a year. Preceptors were burdened with reading for too many courses; they lacked tenure, and some resigned. In\u00ad dependent study did not develop as had been expected. Nevertheless the new preceptors quickened the intellec\u00ad tual life of the University, and the pre\u00ad ceptorial idea took root. In 1914 a fac\u00ad ulty report established procedures for the conduct of preceptorials, but in the years following modifications were gradually made. Preceptors were as\u00ad signed to fewer courses and allowed to concentrate their interests; the title it\u00ad self was ultimately abandoned, al\u00ad though later adopted honorifically for Bicentennial Preceptorships (q.v.). A major change came with the \"four- course\" plan in 1925, when departmen\u00ad tal supervisors took over the precep\u00ad tors' tutorial function\u2014guiding the stu\u00ad dent through independent study to a senior thesis and comprehensive examination\u2014thus realizing Wilson's original plan of a coherent program of study systematically pursued. Precep\u00ad torial instruction came to be more closely attached to courses, including some at the freshman and sophomore levels, and to engage all ranks of the faculty. Over the years the preceptorial sys\u00ad tem has continued to be subject to re\u00ad examination, with surveys and articles, both critical and supportive, appearing from time to time. A 1933 faculty report found shortcomings, but noted \"unanimous and generally enthusiastic approval\"; and a student survey and forum in 1938 reflected favorable un\u00ad dergraduate opinion. In 1949, how\u00ad ever, a special committee noted scepti\u00ad cism by new faculty members. The fac\u00ad ulty were given, in 1953, copies of Points for Preceptors, a booklet pre\u00ad pared by the present writer containing helpful suggestions by experienced preceptors. In 1956 the Alumni Day program was devoted to preceptorials on liberal education. Mounting costs have subsequently led to larger preceptorial groups and, in subjects where knowledge has become increasingly specialized, to more struc\u00ad tured seminars and classes. Patterns of education are always changing, but the preceptorial ideal of a close relation be\u00ad tween teacher and student continues to be honored at Princeton, in keeping with Wilson's belief that \"it is not the whip that makes men but the lure of things worthy to be loved.\" Jeremiah S. Finch * The term \"preceptor\" appears in An Account of the College of New Jersey (1764): \"In the in\u00ad struction of the youth, care is taken to . . . en\u00ad courage their right of private judgment, without . . . demanding an implicit assent to the decisions of the preceptor.\" President of the University is its chief executive officer. He presides at all meetings of the Board of Trustees and 376 PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY of the Faculty and at all academic func\u00ad tions at which he is present and repre\u00ad sents the University before the public. The Trustee by-laws charge him with the general supervision of the interests of the University and with special over\u00ad sight of the departments of instruction. Princeton presidents have been: 1. Jonathan Dickinson 1747 2. Aaron Burr, Sr. 1748-1757: 3. Jonathan Edwards 1758 4. Samuel Davies 1759-1761 5. Samuel Finley 1761-1766 6. John Witherspoon 1768-1794 7. Samuel Stanhope Smith 1795-1812 8. Ashbel Green 1812-1822 9. James Carnahan 1823-1854 10. John Maclean, Jr. 1854-1868 11. James McCosh 1868-1888 12. Francis Landey Patton Woodrow Wilson John Grier Hibben 1912-1932 15. Harold Willis Dodds 1933-1957 16. Robert Francis Goheen 1957-1972 17. William Gordon Bowen 1972- Acting presidents during the inter\u00ad regnums were: and Edward Dick\u00ad inson Duffield, 1932-1933. The first five presidents together served less than twenty years. Their tenures were cut short by untimely deaths owing in part to overwork and in part to the backward state of the art of medicine at that time: Edwards died at 55 of a fever after an innoculation for smallpox; Davies who was tubercular, died at 38, after being bled for a bad cold. In the early years there were two in\u00ad stances of succession by in-laws: Aaron Burr, second president, was succeeded by his father-in-law, Jonathan Ed\u00ad wards. John Witherspoon, sixth presi\u00addent, was succeeded by his son-in-law, Samuel Stanhope Smith. Two presidents were imported from Scotland, John Witherspoon in 1768 and James McCosh, a hundred years later, in 1868, and both left their marks on Princeton and on the nation. They died in Princeton, Witherspoon on No\u00ad vember 15, 1794, McCosh on Novem\u00ad ber 16, 1894\u2014a century and a day apart. Aaron Burr, Sr., at thirty-two, was the youngest man ever elected presi\u00ad dent; Jonathan Dickinson, at fifty-nine, the oldest. James Camahan's tration has been the longest (thirty-one years), Jonathan Edwards' the shortest (five weeks). The royal charter of 1746, which gave the trustees power to \"elect . . . such qualified persons as they think fitt to be empow\u00ad ered them \"at any time [to] Displace and discharge such President.\" Three presidents were induced to resign: Smith in 1812, Green in 1822, Patton in 1902. The first three presidents\u2014Dickin\u00ad son, Burr, and Edwards\u2014were gradu\u00ad ates of Yale. The next two lacked col\u00ad lege degrees; they were trained in clas\u00ad sics and divinity, both in Pennsyl\u00ad vania\u2014Davies in Samuel Blair's school at Faggs William Tennent's \"log was in To\u00ad ronto. Nine earned degrees at Princeton\u2014Smith, Green, Carnahan, Maclean, Wilson, Hibben, Dodds, Go\u00ad heen, Bowen. The President's Lot in the Princeton Cemetery on Witherspoon Street con\u00ad tains the graves of all the deceased presidents of Princeton, except four: Dickinson, who died and was buried in THE PRESS CLUB 377 Elizabethtown, before the college was moved to Princeton; Finley, who died and was buried in Philadelphia (there is a cenotaph for him in the President's Lot, however); Patton, who died and was buried in Bermuda; and Wilson, who died in Washington, D. C. and was interred in the Washington Cathedral. * Although Burr was formally elected Presi\u00ad dent in November 1748, he had been in charge of the College since Dickinson's death in October 1747. Presidents of the United States who at\u00ad tended Princeton are: James Madison A.B. 1771 (Va.) 1809-1817 1879 (NJ.) 1913-1921 John F. Kennedy also attended Prince\u00ad ton as a member of the Class of 1939 but withdrew after several months be\u00ad cause of illness and later graduated from Harvard in the Class of 1940. Two Princeton graduates have been unsuccessful candidates for the Presi\u00ad dency: Norman M. Thomas '05, the Socialist party's candidate in six succes\u00ad sive campaigns 1928 through 1948; and Adlai E. Stevenson '22, the Democratic party's candidate against Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956. Press Club, The, whose undergraduate members serve as Princeton corre\u00ad spondents for metropolitan newspapers and national wire services, was first or\u00ad ganized in 1900, although it seems probable that campus correspondents were functioning long before that. Pres\u00ad ident McCosh may have had them in mind some twenty years earlier when, in an effort to ward off threatened mis\u00ad behavior, he warned students that \"to\u00ad morrow it will be in all the New York papers and the next day in the Philadelphia papers.\" Ex-President Grover Cleveland, who lived in Princeton after completing his second term in Washington, was a good source of copy in the early days of the Press Club. He disliked being inter\u00ad viewed but he granted exceptions for students. \"It may mean five or ten dol\u00ad lars for the boy,\" he told a faculty friend, \"and that would pay his board for a week.\" Once, however, he felt obliged to rebuff an undergraduate re\u00ad porter who pressed him for his opinion on President McKinley's Philippine policy. \"That, sir,\" Cleveland said, \"is a matter of too great importance to dis\u00ad cuss in so brief an interview, now rapidly drawing to a close.\" In the early years, Press Club mem\u00ad bers usually worked free lance and came together only for social occasions. Seniors approaching graduation sold their rights as correspondents for par\u00ad ticular newspapers to the highest bidders\u2014a process that gave more weight to the new reporter's credit at the bank than to his nose for news or his ear for a good sentence. All of this was changed in 1915 when, following a study he made at the re\u00ad quest of the Graduate Council, Profes\u00ad sor Christian Gauss reorganized the club along the lines it has followed ever since. He persuaded the Graduate Council to purchase all of the corre\u00ad spondents' rights from club members (the Council was later repaid) and re\u00ad placed the old auction system with freshman and sophomore competitions for membership. He also introduced the practice of having club members pool their efforts. Most significant of all, he accepted appointment as faculty adviser, a position he held until 1924, when he left Princeton for a year's leave of absence before becoming dean of the 378 PRINCETON CLUB OF NEW YORK College. Press Club advisers after him included Alexander Leitch '24, Freder\u00ad ick S. Osborne '24, Edmund S. De Long '22, Dan D. Coyle '38, and George B. Eager. Sometimes when University news was scarce, Press Club stringers cre\u00ad ated stories. In the twenties, at the suggestion of Dean Gauss, they asked a number of professors what ten books they would want to have with them if they had to spend the rest of their lives on a desert island. The composite re\u00ad sults were unsensational (Shakespeare and Homer led, followed by the Bible, Plato, Dante, and Vergil), but the story got a good play, nevertheless. During a slack period several years later, the club asked another group of professors to list the six most important words (\"loyalty\" was mentioned most fre\u00ad quently), and once more the story ran widely. There were other occasions when Press Club members had more than enough real news to keep them busy\u2014 the Wilson-West row and Wilson's en\u00ad trance into politics in the early 1900s; the kidnapping of Charles A. Lind\u00ad bergh's infant son in nearby Hopewell in 1932; the panic caused by Orson Welles's 1938 radio broadcast of \"an in\u00ad vasion from Mars\" the Universi\u00ad ty's year-long Bicentennial Celebration in 1946-1947. Among Press Club members who made a career of journalism were David Lawrence 10, founder of the U.S. News and World Report; Alfred S. Dashiell '23, managing editor of Reader's Digest; Franklyn S. Adams '25, city editor oiThe New York Times, Mark Anthony Beltaire III '37, daily columnist for The Detroit Free Press. Princeton Club of New York, The, has had four homes since its incorporation on December 7, 1899. It occupied the old Vanderbilt house at the corner of 34th Street and Park Avenue for eight years before moving into its second home, the former residence of the ar\u00ad chitect Stanford White, on Gramercy Park North at Lexington Avenue, where it remained until the outbreak of the First World War. During the war, when younger members were absent in war service, older members enjoyed the hospitality of the Yale Club on Van\u00ad derbilt Avenue at 44th Street; in grati\u00ad tude they endowed the Princeton Club of New York scholarship at Yale. Be\u00ad ginning in 1922, the Princeton Club made its third home at 39th Street and Park Avenue in an old Murray Hill mansion with a ten-story an\u00ad nex. At different times Princeton shared these facilities with the Brown and Dartmouth Clubs. It occupied this home for almost forty years until the early 1960s, when it built its present nine-story limestone clubhouse at 15 West 43rd Street under the leadership of its president, Frank H. Connor '25. Ground was broken on June 15, 1961; while awaiting completion of the build\u00ad ing, rooms were leased in the Columbia University Club across the street. The new clubhouse, which was opened in February 1963, provided a family club, with facilities open to wives of alumni (and, after coeducation, husbands of alumnae), and certain other family members. In the mid-seventies, when many university clubs were consolidat\u00ad ing, the membership of the Columbia Club moved across the street to join forces with Princeton. In the spring of 1978, the Club's membership totaled more than 6,000. An outstanding feature of the Club is the Princeton Library in New York, an eductional corporation chartered by the New York Board of Regents, which in cooperation with the University Li-PRINCETON EDUCATION CENTER AT BLAIRSTOWN 379 brary maintains a 9,000-volume library on the fifth floor of the Club for the use of all Princeton alumni and faculty, and other accredited scholars. The Library also sponsors informal lecture evenings with faculty, students, and alumni as guest speakers. Princeton Education Center at Blairs- town is an outgrowth of the Princeton Summer Camp, which was founded in 1909 near Bay Head on the New Jersey shore and was moved in 1930 to its present 170-acre site on Bass Lake near Blairstown in the northwestern part of the state. Originally overseen by the trustees of the Philadelphian Society and later of the Student Christian Asso\u00ad ciation, the facility has been governed since 1974 by a board of trustees under its present name. The original camp program involved special two-week summer sessions for boys from New York and Philadelphia and from the black and Italian commu\u00ad nities of Princeton. In 1970, it became coeducational and since then has in\u00ad cluded young people mainly from the Princeton-Trenton area as well as from northern New Jersey and Philadelphia. Over the years the camp has pro\u00ad vided an enjoyable and educational ex\u00ad perience for more than 10,000 young people as well as for 750 undergraduate counselors, who according to former Student Director Everard Pinneo '48, \"will always remember the youngsters who came from the hot city streets for a few weeks of fun and adventure. It was a positive experience for them and an equally important one for us. The spe\u00ad cial satisfaction of working with the campers has significantly affected many of our careers and voluntary activities since graduation.\" The Blairstown facilities have also served for many years as a retreat and as workshop quarters for student, fac\u00ad ulty, and staff groups as well as for community organizations. The camp has been supported by many devoted alumni including Dean Mathey '12, Bernard Peyton '17, Lau- rance Rockefeller McAlpin and McCormick families. Some build\u00ad ings bear names of individual benefac\u00ad tors, while cabins memorialize the alumni classes that supported their construction. Another major source of financial aid has been the annual Campus Fund Drive conducted by un\u00ad dergraduates. In 1971, recognizing that program development and major renovation of the physical plant were necessary, the board began a long-range rebuilding program. Architecture Professor Harri\u00ad son Fraker '64 directed a team of Princeton students and outside con\u00ad sultants in designing the new facilities. Their plans involve using natural power \u2014sun, wind and flowing water\u2014both to conserve energy and to give campers and other program participants a first\u00ad hand lesson in ecology. The reconstruc\u00ad tion program began in 1977. The Reverend T Guthrie Speers, Jr. '50, chairman of the Blairstown Board of Trustees during the 1960s and 1970s, has described the Princeton Summer Camp/Princeton Education Center at Blairstown as \"a kind of neutral ground for learning, a non-threatening envi\u00ad ronment, a place where human interac\u00ad tion is greatly facilitated. . . . Simply put, something extra and significant happens, both individually and to the group, in the setting of Blairstown.\" Since 1930, directors of this project have been: Reverend Laurence Fen- ninger '09 (assistant dean of the Chapel) 1930-1945; Howard Stepp he '39 (swimming coach and registrar) 1946- 1966; David Rahr '60 (director, Alumni 380 THE PRINCETON ENGINEER Council) 1966-1970; and John Daniel- son '58 (assistant dean of students) since 1971. John G. Danielson Princeton Engineer, The, began publi\u00ad cation in January 1941. Its founding editors, Theodore Rockwell III '43 and William P. Stadig '43, announced that its threefold purpose was to unite the undergraduate engineers in a new kind of cooperative project, to keep alumni and students informed about the school's activities and facilities, and to help procure for the engineering school \"the recognition it deserved\" in the outside world. The magazine appeared to be well on its way to achieving the third aim in 1956, when Dean Elgin disclosed that ten paid subscriptions were going regularly to Moscow. Princetonian, The, came into existence on June 14, 1876, to provide, in the words of one of its early editors, Wood- row Wilson 1879, \"an impartial record of College incident and a medium for a bold, frank, and manly expression of College opinion.\" From the beginning, the Prince\u00ad tonian caused occasional unhappiness in Nassau Hall. President McCosh had been at one time uncomfortably aware that it was \"in the way of attacking the faculty,\" although by 1888, when he re\u00ad tired, he thought the paper was being conducted \"in the most admirable spir\u00ad it.\" His only complaint then was that it gave \"more space to gymnastics than to literature,\" an imbalance that led an Oxford don to say to him, after reading several issues of the paper, \"Pray, are you the president of a gymnastic in\u00ad stitution?\" In its formative years, the Prince\u00ad tonian was closer in form and style to an eighteenth-century coffeehouse journal than to a modern newspaper. Brief es\u00ad says considered topics such as Ameri\u00ad can Education, Conceit, The Utility of Women, Life on the Nile, and the Col\u00ad lege Loafer. Editorials condemned the faculty's disciplinary action following a classroom disorder, curtly dismissed the \"visionary schemes\" of \"puerile graduates\" for the improvement of col\u00ad lege discipline, opposed coeducation (\"Our belief and it is des\u00ad tined . . . to die and go the way of all isms.\"), and declared, on the subject of faculty preaching in chapel, \"In plain English the College sermon cannot keep the congregation awake.\" One of the first issues contained a plea for unproctored examinations, a cause the Princetonian continued to advocate until the honor system was adopted by the faculty in 1893. The editors also showed enterprise in re\u00ad porting what news there was, publish\u00ad ing an extra with a telegraphic report of a Yale-Princeton baseball game at New Haven in 1895\u2014one of the first, if not the first, uses of the telegraph by a col\u00ad lege newspaper. As the college grew and its activities multiplied, the original \"fortnightly\" became a weekly in 1883, a tri-weekly in 1885, and began appearing P.S the Daily Princetonian five afternoons a week in 1892 and six mornings a week in 1895. This last change created a problem because students began read\u00ad ing the paper during morning chapel, a practice that was eventually moderated in response to editorial warnings that the displeasure it caused the faculty was endangering the continuance of the morning edition. Two events around this time inspired special coverage: on President Mc- Cosh's death in 1894, a whole issue was devoted to a tribute that must have dis-THE PRINCETONIAN 381 pelled any suspicion that he had been the \"president of a gymnastic institu\u00ad tion,\" and after the College's cele\u00ad brated Sesquicentennial Exercises in 1896, extensive coverage of these ceremonies included the full text of all the addresses, among them Woodrow Wilson's famous \"Princeton in the Na\u00ad tion's Service.\" After Wilson became president in 1902, he was a frequent subject of editorials and news. When he made known his intention to build a fence around Prospect, the Prince objected on aesthetic grounds, but when the fence was built, and a group of students tore part of it down, an editorial casti\u00ad gated them for their \"vandalism.\" The editors were enthusiastic about Wil\u00ad son's preceptorial system, skeptical of his quad plan, and regretful when he resigned to enter political life. On his election as president of the United States in 1912, front-page stories caught the spirit of jubilation that swept the campus and culminated in a mid\u00ad night student procession to Wilson's house on Cleveland Lane. The pre-World War I years saw further advances in news coverage and editorial policy. In 1910 the paper en\u00ad larged its page size and began publish\u00ad ing Associated Press dispatches. The following year a letter to the editor touched off an extended argument about compulsory chapel attend\u00ad ance\u2014a perennial source of comment in the Prince until 1964 when the last vestige of the requirement was re\u00ad moved by the trustees. In 1915, when women suffrage was being voted on in New Jersey, the Prince carried on a strong and well-articulated campaign on its behalf, calling it \"the greatest so\u00ad cial question of the day\u2014the enfran\u00ad chisement of the other half of the people.\" Two years later, the paper came out in favor of the Cleveland re\u00ad volt against the eating clubs, an early response to an issue destined to achieve editorial popularity exceeding even that of compulsory chapel. In the twenties, the Prince, true to the times, was enterprising, prosper\u00ad ous, lighthearted, and\u2014on occasion\u2014 careless of official dignity. Its editors added a weekly photographic supple\u00ad ment and a monthly \"Literary Ob\u00ad server\" (both of which succumbed to the Depression), introduced a number of popular humorous columns such as \"Diogene's Lamp,\" \"The Tower,\" and \"The Crow's Nest,\" and initiated two antic diversions that were carried on for many years, the Gaily Prints- anything and the April Fool's story. The Gaily Printsanything was the title retiring boards gave their last is\u00ad sue, in which they celebrated release from their sober duties. Advertised as \"a scurrilous sheet dedicated to yellow journalism,\" it usually contained lurid tales (accompained by doctored photo\u00ad graphs) of public misbehaviour of the president, deans, and faculty, invari\u00ad ably depicted as dissolute rogues and scoundrels. The April Fool's story that caused the greatest stir was the announcement on April 1, 1927, that the trustees had ac\u00ad cepted a gift of $20 million from the executors of the estate of \"Nettie Green\" to establish coeducation at Princeton. At the end of the article, pointed attention was called to the date, but not everybody read that far, and Nassau Hall was besieged with pro\u00ad testing telephone calls, telegrams, and letters. It came as no surprise to President Hibben's associates when he once con\u00ad fided that he made it a rule never to read the Princetonian until after break\u00ad fast. 382 THE PRINCETONIAN In the eventful decade before World War II, the Princetonian played a more serious role. It collaborated with the Harvard Crimson in marshaling stu\u00ad dent opposition to Prohibition. It is\u00ad sued emergency scrip for student use during the 1933 bank holiday. It gave increased attention in news and edito\u00ad rials to the developing world crisis, and as time for decision drew nearer, it opened its columns to opposing views on American intervention. With Presi\u00ad dent Roosevelt's declaration of an un\u00ad limited national emergency in May 1941, the paper headlined a front-page editorial \"The Debate is Over,\" and the day after Pearl Harbor, proclaimed in a banner headline: PRINCETON PRE\u00ad SENTS UNITED FRONT AS UNITED STATES FACES TOTAL WAR. In February 1943, the Prince\u00ad tonian suspended publication for the duration of the war. The decades following the war saw the paper through one of its busiest pe\u00ad riods. The Prince brought out an extra the morning of Albert Einstein's death in 1955 and devoted most of the next day's regular issue to tributes from friends and colleagues. Another extra in 1956 reported President Goheen's elec\u00ad tion a little more than three hours after it had been announced at a faculty meeting. The following year there were special editions on the retirement of President Dodds and the death of Football Coach Charlie Caldwell. Eat\u00ad ing club elections continued to be an important source of news and editorials through the fifties and sixties, with em\u00ad phasis first on the ideal of 100 percent sophomore elections and later on the need for social alternatives to the club system itself. In 1963 an extra covered President Kennedy's assassination and the cancel\u00ad lation of University events that weekend, and for a week following Martin Luther King's assassination in 1968, the paper featured editorials, let\u00ad ters, and accounts of various meetings on how best to advance the cause he embodied as \"the responsible leader of a race striving to obtain peacefully the rights which belong to all Americans.\" Editorials of this period were sharply critical of the war in Vietnam and called for early disengagement, while press\u00ad ing on the University front for a larger student role in campus affairs, for the adoption of coeducation, and for sup\u00ad port of the administration's efforts to increase the enrollment of minority groups. In 1968 a feature on \"A New Era for the Negro at Princeton\" won an award as the best college newspaper story of the year. In the next two years the Prince\u00ad tonian published some of the most sig\u00ad nificant news in its history. In the spring of 1969 banner headlines an\u00ad nounced trustee approval of coeduca\u00ad tion beginning that fall; the same issue reported trustee acceptance of the pro\u00ad posal that a member of each graduating class be elected to a four-year term on the board, and added a word of con\u00ad gratulation to the trustees for their \"courage\" and \"foresight\" an edito\u00ad rial captioned \"Victory for the Student Voice.\" At Commencement, the paper distributed a two-page reunion extra headlining the fact that the newly con\u00ad stituted electorate\u2014juniors, seniors, and members of the two youngest alumni classes\u2014had chosen Princeton's first black alumni trustee. These and other innovations, and the new respon\u00ad sibilities and opportunities they pre\u00ad sented, were summed up in the annual June issue for incoming freshmen in a lead editorial headed \"The times, they are a changin'.\" In 1970, the Prince took an active part in the growing campus protest against the war in Vietnam, which cul-THE PRINCETONIAN 383 minated in an unprecedented student strike following the extension of the war into Cambodia. Besides providing up- to-the-minute schedules of strike ac\u00ad tivities, the Prince staff hand-set and distributed a special Sunday 2 a.m. strike extra, gave detailed coverage of student rallies, faculty meetings, and a community-wide Jadwin Gym assem\u00ad bly, and in the place traditionally used for University condolences, extended its sympathy to the families and friends of the four Kent State University stu\u00ad dents killed while protesting the war. The editors also helped promote adop\u00ad tion of a two-week recess for student political campaigning before the No\u00ad vember congressional elections, made possible, they later wrote, by \"the re\u00ad markable unity of community opinion,\" which allowed the University \"to chan\u00ad nel the energy of the strike into con\u00ad structive action.\" The paper celebrated its hundredth anniversary in 1976 with a June semi\u00ad nar on \"The Ethics of Leaks\" and a two-day symposium on \"The Press and Social Change.\" In its day-to-day ac\u00ad tivities, it was still committed to the ob\u00ad jective it had set for itself at its found\u00ad ing, but now the operation was consid\u00ad erably larger and faster. The fortnightly that a staff of eight or nine produced in the beginning took five days to print by hand press in Trenton. A hundred years later, the five-times-a-week daily tabloid required the efforts of more than a hundred editors, reporters, pho\u00ad tographers, and business people, and took only hours to print by the photo- offset process it converted to in 1972. Thanks to the revenues produced by energetic advertising and circulation departments, it was one of the coun\u00ad try's few financially independent col\u00ad lege newspapers. Over the years the Princetonian has maintained a respected position in campus life. In senior polls it was usu\u00ad ally voted the most highly regarded ex\u00ad tracurricular activity outside athletics. Places on the board were eagerly sought, and competition for them could be strenuous, as Hamilton Fish Arm\u00ad strong '16, suggests in this picture of half a dozen surviving \"heelers\" his freshman year: We were exhausted, suspicious, eat\u00ad ing little, sleeping little, barely hang\u00ad ing on to passing grades in our aca\u00ad demic work, bleary-eyed, pimply, scavenging for bits of news to sup\u00ad plement the stories assigned to us, fighting in every way possible, fair or foul, to add to our lineage in the paper. For their part, most editors would probably agree with the 1879 board's valedictory statement that \"the duties of editing\" had given them \"a closer and more perfect view of college life and affairs.\" Nassau Hall, for its part, apparently has come to accept the fact that as long as there is a Princeton, there will be a Princetonian carrying on the time-honored mission of college journalism, which is, President Dodds once ruefully observed, \"to comfort the afflicted and to afflict the comfortable.\" Former Princetonian editors have achieved prominence, particularly in government and journalism. Govern\u00ad ment leaders have included, in addition to Woodrow Wilson, Adlai E. Steven\u00ad son '22; Secretary of Defense James Forrestal '15; Supreme Court Justice John M. Harlan '20; Secretary of the Air Force James Douglas '20; Under Secretary of the Treasury H. Chapman Rose '28; General Counsel of the Treasury Nelson P. Rose '31; and Am\u00ad bassadors Livingston T. Merchant '26, Jacob D. Beam '29, Shelby C. Davis '30, Robert H. McBride '40, and Wil\u00ad liam H. 384 PRINCETON-IN-ASIA conspicuous jour\u00ad nalism and letters have been: Robert McLean '13, publisher, Philadelphia Evening Bulletin; Henry A. Laughlin 14, president, Houghton Mifflin Com\u00ad pany; Hamilton Fish Armstrong '16, editor, Foreign Affairs; Richard Hal\u00ad liburton '21, world traveler, explorer, and writer; John S.

Princeton-in-Asia is the outgrowth of a relationship that began in 1898 when the Philadelphian Society sent Robert R. Gailey A.M. 1896 (a football Ail- American) to north China to pioneer Y.M.C.A. work there. He was sub\u00ad sequently joined by Dwight Edwards '04 (honorary Doctor of Philanthropy 1949), Louis D. Froelick '06 (later editor of Asia magazine), and others. With student and alumni support, they evolved a program, called Princeton- in-Peking, which for twenty years sent Princetonians to China to help staff the Peking Y.M.C.A. Under the leadership of John S. Burgess '05 and Sidney D. Gamble '12, whose social survey of Pe\u00ad king (published in 1921) was the first ever made of an Oriental city, the pro\u00ad gram in 1930 became the Princeton- Yenching Foundation, which helped to organize a sociology department in Yenching University and to develop it into a college of public affairs. In the 1950s the organization's name was changed to Princeton-in-Asia, and support was shifted to colleges in Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. With the expansion of the University's efforts in East Asian Studies, the pro\u00ad gram further broadened its scope, send\u00ad ing recent graduates as teaching fellows to colleges in Japan, China, Hong Kong, and Indonesia, helping alumni and undergraduates to obtain summer jobs in teaching or in business in these countries, and providing scholarships for Asian students in Asian universities. Princeton Inn College was founded in 1970 in response to a need and an idea. The need, resulting from the admission of women to the university, was hous\u00ad ing; the idea was to create a special kind of undergraduate community, a resi\u00ad dential college. The old Princeton Inn, built in 1924-25, was a gracious, rambling hotel.* On the rear terrace, overlook\u00ad ing the pond of Springdale golf course, where the British had made a tempo\u00ad rary stand during the Battle of Princeton, guests could sip a cocktail and listen to the music of the carillon float down from the Cleveland Tower. Now the college occupies the main building of the Inn, as well as the former employees' quarters, called the Annex, and a new building opened in 1971, the Addition. Four hundred and forty undergraduates live in these facili\u00ad ties. On the terrace, where waiters in formal dress once served mint juleps, \"PRINCETON IN THE NATION'S SERVICE\" 385 coeds now sun themselves or play frisbee in the spring. The new Inn was planned as a resi\u00ad dential college, a community to join what Princeton has traditionally put asunder: academic and social life; different classes; undergraduates, graduate students, townspeople, and faculty; men and women. (Even Princeton Borough and Township come together at the Inn, since the boundary line runs through the center of the lobby.) This purpose has given the col\u00ad lege an informal, egalitarian way of life. Even in relation to its fellow colleges, Wilson and Stevenson, Princeton Inn tends to be regarded as the edge of campus. Spiritually as well as geo\u00ad graphically, it can seem either a prom\u00ad ising frontier or too far to walk (ten minutes from Firestone Library). In its early days the college became known for its raffish, bohemian air. The first Master announced his goal as \"per\u00ad petual Woodstock\"; the mural in the coffee house sprouted an enormous shaggy Love. Eventually, as the coun\u00ad terculture faded, the look and style of the Inn became respectable: solid fur\u00ad niture, chamber music, and Shake\u00ad speare. But the spirit of democracy re\u00ad mains strong. Appropriately, the only name officially honored by the Inn be\u00ad longs to a respectable socialist. In May 1975, the 10,000-volume college library was dedicated to Norman Thomas '05. More social and cultural activities take place at Princeton Inn, probably, than anywhere else on campus. Almost every evening something will be hap\u00ad pening: a dance, party, or poetry read\u00ad ing; Black Thoughts or French conver\u00ad sation; a festival of Latin-American movies or a conference on Virginia Woolf. Most of these events are run by students, supported by student funds, and responsible to a student council. Assistant and Associate Masters (graduate students and faculty resi\u00ad dents) help look after the college as a whole, as do the Masters (scholars as well as administrators). The Masters of the Inn have been Albert Sonnenfeld (1970-1973), Lawrence and Joanna Lipking (1973-1976), and Gerald and Lou Ann Garvey (1976- ). Lawrence Lipking * A still older Princeton Inn, located on the site of the current Borough Hall, had been in use for twenty-five years (1893-1918). \"Princeton in the Nation's Service\" is the title of an oration Woodrow Wilson delivered at the Sesquicentennial cele\u00ad bration (q.v.), when Princeton looked back to its founding in 1746. For his in\u00ad augural address as president of the University in 1902, when he outlined a program for Princeton's future, he used almost the same title: \"Princeton for the Nation's Service\" (italics ours). But the 1896 oration is more memorable and its title the one so frequently quoted. Wilson began with a brief sketch of Princeton's first twenty years, under its five earliest presidents, and then de\u00ad voted the major part of his address to the administration of Princeton's sixth president, John Witherspoon (q.v.), di\u00ad vine, scholar, and statesman, whose \"vitality entered like a tonic into the college, kept it alive in . . . time of peril\u2014made it as individual and inex\u00ad tinguishable a force as he himself was, alike in scholarship and in public af\u00ad fairs.\" He then told how Witherspoon, who came from Scotland in 1768 and was president of the College until he died in 1794, helped make a new constitu\u00ad tion for New Jersey, became her spokesman in the Continental Con-386 \"PRINCETON IN THE NATION'S SERVICE gress, and voted for and signed the Declaration of Independence. He \"stood forth in the sight of all the people a great advocate and orator, deeming himself forward in the service of God when most engaged in the serv\u00ad ice of men and of liberty.\" Wilson went on to describe dra\u00ad matically the events that took place in Princeton during the Revolution, how Nassau Hall became a military hospital, then a barracks, and finally on January 3, 1777, a stronghold that changed hands three times. On that memorable day, there was fighting in the streets and cannon fire against Nassau Hall, as Washington, who only a few days be\u00ad fore had been beaten and in full retreat, after crossing the Delaware, defeated the British and changed \"the whole face of the war.\" Princeton, Wilson pointed out, be\u00ad came as much a center of politics as it was of fighting: the state legislature and its revolutionary Council of Safety sat in Nassau Hall on occasion, and the Continental Congress (to which news of peace came in October) met there in 1783. The Commencement audience that year saw Washington and Wither- spoon on the platform together, \"the two men, it was said, who could not be matched for striking presence in all the country.\" Under Witherspoon, Princeton \"be\u00ad came herself for a time . . the aca\u00ad demic center of the Revolution\" and sent into public life an extraordinary number of notable statesmen: twenty- one senators, thirty-nine representa\u00ad tives, twelve governors, three Supreme Court justices, one vice-president, and a president, all within a period of about twenty-five years, and from a college which seldom had more than a hundred students. Nine Princeton men were delegates at the Constitutional Conven\u00adtion, and five of these were Wither- spoon's students.* It would be absurd, Wilson said, to pretend that one could single out a dis\u00ad tinctive Princeton mark in the Revolu\u00ad tion or the Constitution: We can show nothing more of his\u00ad torical fact than that her own presi\u00ad dent took a great place of leadership in that time of change, and became one of the first figures of the age; that the college which he led, and to which he gave his spirit, contributed more than her share of public men to the making of the nation, outranked her elder rivals in the roll call of the constitutional convention, and seemed for a little a seminary of statesmen rather than a quiet seat of academic learning. What takes our admiration and engages our fancy in looking back to that time is the generous union then established in the college between the life of phi\u00ad losophy and the life of the State. Coming down to the present, Wilson declared it the duty of institutions of learning in a democracy not merely to inculcate a sense of duty, \"but to il\u00ad luminate duty by every lesson that can be drawn out of the past.\" He then spoke of the contributions various dis\u00ad ciplines could make to this purpose. Toward the end of his address, he urged that the College identify itself with the needs of the nation\u2014in a pas\u00ad sage often quoted, which was an essen\u00ad tial idea in the founding, in 1930, of the School of Public and International Af\u00ad fairs, later named for Wilson: . . . It is indispensable, it seems to me, if [a college] is to do its right service, that the air of affairs should be admitted to all its classrooms. I do not mean the air of party politics, but the air of the world's transactions, PRINCETON THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY 387 the consciousness of the solidarity of the race, the sense of the duty of man toward man, of the presence of men in every problem, of the significance of truth for guidance as well as for knowledge. . . . We dare not keep aloof and closet ourselves while a na\u00ad tion comes to its maturity. The days of glad expansion are gone; our life grows tense and difficult; our re\u00ad source for the future lies in careful thought, providence, and a wise economy; and the school must be of the nation.

Princeton Theological Seminary. An offspring of the College, the Theologi\u00ad cal Seminary draws upon the common heritage of the vigorous reawakening of \"New Light\" Presbyterianism in the mid-1700s. In 1811, the Presbyterian General Assembly decided that the College was becoming too secular in its curriculum and general climate and that ministers required a quality of pro\u00ad fessional training beyond the scope of a liberal arts college. The College, on its part, had come to feel that the influ\u00adence of the church was too restrictive. The founding of the Seminary deprived the College of the financial support of the Presbyterian establishment and only after the lay graduates of the Col\u00ad lege, many years later, began to ac\u00ad quire both wealth and concern for the welfare of their alma mater did the Col\u00ad lege regain its momentum in evolving into a leading liberal university. From its opening in 1812, the Semi\u00ad nary has been blessed with able leader\u00ad ship, including its first professor, Ar\u00ad chibald Alexander, and soon thereafter, Samuel Miller and Charles Hodge. It became the dominant influence in Presbyterianism in the United States for more than a century. Administered by its faculty with a rotation of leader\u00ad ship until 1902, its first president was Francis Landey Patton, previously president of the University, who was followed by J. Ross Stevenson in 1914, John A. Mackay in 1936, and James I. McCord in 1959. Today, the Princeton Theological Seminary not only is the outstanding Presbyterian Seminary in the country but is one of the leading seminaries in the world. Its distinguished faculty of thirty-eight is supplemented by four\u00ad teen adjunct and visiting professors and more than fifty pastors and chaplains cooperating in field training. Its 740 students come from throughout the world and from many confessions. It awards advanced degrees and provides mid-career instruction to large num\u00ad bers of ministers through institutes and special seminars. Its Speer Library is one of the best research libraries in its field. While remaining separate institu\u00ad tions, the Seminary and the University have cooperated in many ways in en\u00ad riching the intellectual life of an aca\u00ad demic community. J. Doughs Brown 388 THE PRINCETON TIGER Princeton Tiger, The, first appeared in March 1882 but ceased publication that December after only nine issues. The evidence is not clear whether this was for lack of funds or, as has been sug\u00ad gested, because the editors had in\u00ad curred faculty displeasure for having pressed too far their discovery (in Somerset Maugham's phrase) that \"im\u00ad propriety is the soul of wit.\" In 1890 the Tiger was born again. This time it survived, despite the fact that its early efforts were made difficult by an unsympathetic faculty and by ad\u00ad vertisers \"far from warm-hearted.\" McCready Sykes 1894 recalled involv\u00ad ing President Patton in a discussion of Greek syntax in order to avoid the dif\u00ad ficult task of having to demonstrate why the Tiger should not be required to discontinue publication. Booth Tar- kington 1893 (q.v.) remembered two editors spending a Saturday in New York in search of ads, and returning with an expense account for two round-trip tickets, eight hours hansom cab service, and an \"enviable lunch at the Hoffman House,\" and, to offset these items, \"a single, almost-promised ad that would bring\u2014it was hoped\u2014 five dollars.\" Tarkington, a frequent contributor of jokes and pen-line drawings, also re\u00ad called that it was easy to get students to accept membership on the Tiger board, but harder to get them to write, draw, or edit. This proved a continuing prob\u00ad lem. In their day F. Scott Fitzgerald '17 (q.v.) and John Biggs, Jr. 18, produced whole issues of the Tiger, unassisted, by working through the night together. In the 1920s the Tiger prospered greatly. Circulation reached 10,000; average issues numbered sixty pages, many of them heavy with ads. A sinking fund was started to finance a building like the Harvard Lampoon's (a hope never realized), and the 1924 board contributed $1,000 to the new chapel, thus showing that the oft-offending Tiger was, after all, on the side of the angels. In 1932 the Tiger, tracing its date of birth back to 1882, celebrated its gol\u00ad den jubilee by issuing in book form \"A Compendium of Half a Century of Princeton Wit and Humor, if any, in Prose, Picture, and Poesy.\" Two board members of the thirties used the talents they demonstrated in college to make their marks in later life. Whitney Darrow Jr. '31's Tiger cartoons showed the beginnings of the distinc\u00ad tive style he later developed as a regu\u00ad lar cartoonist for The New Yorker. Lewis Thomas '33, who wrote for the Tiger while majoring in biology, later became well known as a leader in med\u00ad ical education and cancer research and as the author of a widely praised volume of essays, The Lives of a Cell. In May 1942 the Tiger announced that it was suspending operations for the duration of the war, although many thought the suspension had been has\u00ad tened by Nassau Hall's disapproval of the improprieties of their wit. In 1947 the editors secured reluctant permis\u00ad sion to resume publication. In these years Henry R. Martin '48 drew car\u00ad toons for the Tiger while majoring in art history; later he joined Whitney Dar\u00ad row as a frequent contributor to The New Yorker. In 1952 the Tiger, again experiencing difficulties, sought to appeal to a wider campus audience by becoming \"con\u00ad cerned with all things relevant to Princeton,\" while continuing to run cartoons and a few other bits of its old fare. The managing editor, John A. McPhee '53's pungent columns in the Tiger gave a hint of the style that later distinguished his widely known writing for The New Yorker. Though the Tiger was still strong PRINCETON UNIVERSITY PRESS 389 enough in 1957 to produce a \"Roar of Laughter\" (the title of its 75th anniver\u00ad sary number), there were hard times ahead, and when the fortunes of college humor magazines declined in the late sixties and early seventies, the plight of the Tiger was highlighted in a feature story in the New York Times, and in an editorial headlined \"Tiger, tiger burn\u00ad ing low\" lamenting the implications of this trend \"in a world badly in need of laughter and satire.\" If the Tiger s more frequent appearances in the mid- seventies are any indication, there is still a chance that it will be burning bright again one day. Princeton University Press was founded in 1905 by a gift from Charles Scribner 1875, and incorporated in 1910 as a non-profit corporation \"to es\u00ad tablish, maintain, and operate a print\u00ad ing and publishing plant, for the pro\u00ad motion of education and scholarship, and to serve the University by man\u00ad ufacturing and distributing its publica\u00ad tions.\" The first director was Whitney Dar- row '03, who brought the Press into be\u00ad ing. He was succeeded by Paul Tomlin- son '09, who built up the printing plant and published many notable books dur\u00ad ing his long term, 1917-1938. The brief tenure, 1938-1941, of Joseph Brandt was a turning point in the development of the Press; from then on there was in\u00ad creasing emphasis on publishing rather than printing. This emphasis was further developed by Datus C. Smith, Jr. '29, with whom began the Press's greatest period of growth and achieve\u00ad ment, continued since 1954 under the directorship of Herbert S. Bailey, Jr. '42. Like many other good things in life the Press had a humble beginning. It started by buying out a small local printer and setting up shop in rented quarters over a drugstore on Nassau Street. In 1911 Charles Scribner gave the Press its handsome and unique building on William Street. At first the Scribner Building was mainly a printing plant, but in 1967 it was completely renovated and became the offices of the publishing division. An additional building was erected in nearby Law- renceville to house the modern print\u00ad ing plant, warehouse, and accounting department. It was named the Laugh- lin Building, after Henry A. Laughlin '14, a former trustee and president of the Press's Board of Trustees. Although closely connected with the University, the Press is a separate, fi\u00ad nancially independent corporation which has its own fifteen trustees, nine of whom must be members of the fac\u00ad ulty, administration, or alumni of Princeton. The president of the Uni\u00ad versity is an ex officio trustee, and he appoints four faculty members to the Editorial Board, which controls the im\u00ad print of the Press. True to the purpose for which it was founded, the Press publishes scholarly books and continues to print most of them in its own plant. It prints for the University and some other non-profit organizations. The Press has published nearly 3,000 titles since its first book, John Wither- spoon's Lectures in Moral Philosophy, appeared in 1912. These have included such seminal volumes as Einstein's The Meaning of Relativity, von Neumann and Morgenstern's The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, and Edward S. Corwin's The Constitution and What It Means Today. Currently it publishes about 100 new books each year, selected from about 1,000 manu\u00ad scripts submitted. The Press is respon\u00ad sible for a number of long-term projects intended to serve scholarship for many decades and perhaps centuries. One of 390 PRINCETON UNIVERSITY PRESS these is The Papers of Thomas Jeffer\u00ad son, edited by Julian P. Boyd; the first volume was published in 1950, and over 60 are expected. Another is The Papers of Woodrow Wilson, edited by Arthur S. Link, for which about 45 vol\u00ad umes are planned. Princeton University Press is co\u00ad operating with the National Endow\u00ad ment for the Humanities' program to produce authoritative editions of classic American authors by issuing The Writ\u00ad ings of Henry D. Thoreau, which is ex\u00ad pected to encompass some 20 volumes. Another major project is the Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Archaeologi- calSites (1976), which contains descrip\u00ad tions of about 2,800 sites by some 400 authors and is a unique reference work in its field. In 1972 it was announced that the Press will publish The Writings of Albert Einstein with the cooperation of Princeton University and the Insti\u00ad tute for Advanced Study, where Ein\u00ad stein's archives are housed. The Bollingen Series, begun in the 1940s by the Bollingen Foundation, was given to the Press in 1969 with the responsibility for carrying on its work in the fields of aesthetics, archaeology, cultural history, ethnology, literary criticism, mythology, philosophy, psy\u00ad chology, religion, and symbolism. It includes such great projects as The Collected Works of C. G. Jung, The Collected Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and The Collected Works of Paul Valery, which the New York Times Book Review called \"undoubt\u00ad edly one of the most distinguished and ambitious series of books ever issued by an American publisher.\" Over the years Princeton University Press books have won numerous hon\u00ad ors, including at different times Pulitzer Prizes, National Book Awards, Bancroft Prizes, and various awards from the professional scholarly associa\u00ad tions. The Press has also received many awards for excellence in printing and design. The Press publishes three scholarly journals: World Politics, issued for the University's Center of International Studies; The Annals of Mathematics, sponsored by the University and the Institute for Advanced Study; and Phi\u00ad losophy <L\u00b7 Public Affairs, with no out\u00ad side sponsorship, which is written for those concerned with the philosophical exploration of public issues in law, sociology, political science, and eco\u00ad nomics. Since its inception, the Press has printed and published the Princeton Alumni Weekly (q.v.), one of the na\u00ad tion's oldest alumni magazines. It is editorially directed by an alumni board, but managed by the Press, and has its offices in the Scribner Building. Some 40,000 copies of each issue are distrib\u00ad uted. In 1976, 98 new clothbound titles and 42 paperbacks were pub\u00ad lished; 725,000 books were sold\u2014 320,000 hardcover, 405,000 paperback. Approximately 75 percent of total sales are from the backlist. The Press's paperback program, with over 300 ti\u00ad tles in print, has been in operation since 1965, and is one of the largest among university presses. Princeton University Press achieves a worldwide distribution of its books, and about 25 percent of them are sold abroad. The Press's largest foreign cus\u00ad tomers, in order, are: the United King\u00ad dom, Japan, Canada, Germany, Hol\u00ad land, Italy, Australia, and India. Princeton's bestselling hardback book is the Wilhelm/Baynes translation of the I Ching, or Book of Changes in the Bollingen Series, with over 400,000 copies sold. The bestselling paperback THE OFFICE OF PROCTOR 391 is R. R. Palmer's translation of Lefebvre's Coming of the French Rev\u00ad olution, sales of which exceeded 160,000. The authors come from many differ\u00ad ent institutions and countries. About 25 percent are affiliated with the Univer\u00ad sity. Others have come from a wide variety of colleges and universities in America and, in recent years, in Aus\u00ad tralia, Canada, Germany, Greece, Is\u00ad rael, Switzerland, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. Thus Princeton University Press, in fulfillment of its Charter, serves the University and the world of scholarship through printing and publishing. Its motto is: \"Putting Knowledge to Work.\" Herbert S. Bailey, Jr. Princeton University Store, The, col\u00ad loquially known orignally as the Uni- vee Store, later as the U-Store, has been doing business since 1905. It was an outgrowth of a student-managed bookstore that began modest opera\u00ad tions in a corner room of West College in 1896. Robert C. McNamara '03, first manager 1905-1908, added athletic supplies and extended the Store's quar\u00ad ters into two more rooms. (He eventu\u00ad ally became chairman of the board of Scott, Foresman & Co.) B. Franklin Bunn '07, manager 1908-1947, added most of the Store's present depart\u00ad ments and extended its quarters to in\u00ad clude the entire first floor of West Col\u00ad lege, with a separate shop for music in town. Under the direction of Frederick John Worthington (B.A., University of Colorado, 1937, M.S., New York Uni\u00ad versity 1938) who became manager in 1947, the Store in 1958 combined all of its activities under one roof in a new building of its own at 36 University Place, designed by Eldredge Snyder '22. When McNamara left in 1908, an\u00ad nual sales were $60,000, and when Bunn retired in 1947 they were $1,100,000. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1976, they were $5,500,000. The Store is a cooperative society whose membership is open to Univer\u00ad sity members and alumni and also members of the Theological Seminary and the Institute for Advanced Study. It pays its members an annual rebate, which reached a peak of 12\u00bd percent the first year after World War II and leveled off at 7.64 in the mid-seventies. The Store is governed by a board of trustees, composed of undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, administra\u00ad tion, alumni, and the manager. Dean of the Faculty Henry B. Fine '80 and University Secretary Charles W. McAlpin '88, who were prime movers in the founding of the Store, were trus\u00ad tees for many years. Dean of the Fac\u00ad ulty J. Douglas Brown 19, Chandler Cudlipp '19, one-time vice-president of McCutcheon's and later head of his own interior designing firm in New York City, and John H. Leh '21, senior partner of the H. Leh and Co. depart\u00ad ment store, Allentown, Pennsylvania, made notable contributions as trustees to the Store's later development. The Store's membership as of June 30, 1976, numbered some 46,000. Proctor, The Office of, was instituted in 1870 by President McCosh to help him discharge the heavy disciplinary burden that his predecessor, John Mac\u00ad lean, had carried almost single-handed. The first incumbent, Matthew Goldie (brother of George Goldie, director of the gymnasium), had good rapport with the undergraduates. \"He was square and honest,\" one of them said, \"and 392 THE OFFICE OF PROCTOR played no favorites. He hated cant and hypocrisy, and was a watchdog with\u00ad out being a spy.\" Matt's assistant, known to the students only as \"Den\u00ad nis,\" was less popular. As McCosh's messenger to undergraduates sus\u00ad pected of wrong-doing, his stock phrase was: \"You are to see the Doctor in his study tonight\"; he was regarded as \"a bird of ill omen whose very presence contaminated the atmosphere.\" When Goldie retired in 1892 his place was taken by Johnny Topley. Ap\u00ad parently Topley had to discharge the baleful mission once performed by Dennis, for the seniors had this song about him: Johnny, Johnny Topley, Johnny, Johnny Topley, Do you In 1907 Topley resigned his proctor\u00ad ship and, to the delight of the students and the discomfort of the Dean, opened a saloon across the street from FitzRan- dolph Gateway. The seniors continued to sing about him; but now they gave the question \"Do you want me?\" an en\u00ad sold his saloon in 1913, he was soon lost sight of, but seniors continued to sing about his legendary services on into the twenties. Bill Coan, who followed Topley, was born and reared in Princeton, and it was said that his expertise about stu\u00ad dent escapades had been acquired through his own participation in similar happenings in earlier days. A chastened sophomore, on leaving a meeting of the Discipline Committee, was once heard to complain, \"Bill knew what I did be\u00ad fore I did it.\" A faculty member of the committee, learned in Greek mythol\u00ad ogy, likened Coan to Argus of the hundred eyes. Hank Bovie, who took over from Coan in 1919, was tall and handsome and cut a magisterial figure, but the seniors thought him slow in crime de\u00ad tection. One year they sang: Although it seems beyond belief, They say that once he caught a thief. Another year: We lose fur coats in winter's chills, And get them back with the daffodils. Thus recommended, Hank became chief of detectives of the Borough in 1926. Francis X. Hogarty, who assumed Bovie's mantle, was an earnest some\u00ad what stolid guardian of campus morals. Once, when the Discipline Committee was examining a charge of intoxication, Dean Gauss, leaning over backward to be fair, said, \"Frank, how can you be sure this student was intoxicated?\" \"Well, Dean,\" the ever solemn Frank replied, \"I saw him fall flat on his face. I think he was drunk.\" Frank was ably assisted by Michael Kopliner and by Harry Cawley. Frank, Mike, and Harry inspired the Proctor's Song of the thirties and forties: There are three men in Princeton town, They look us up, they look us down; Like the plague, they're all around, Heigh-ho, the proctors, the Pinkertons of Princeton. PROSPECT 393 There were other verses with other in\u00ad timations: \"They try on us to place the blame,\" Mike Kopliner, who joined the staff in 1924, had one of the longest tours of duty on record\u201436 years\u2014and became one of the best remembered proctors. Once, in 1931, toward the end of the Prohibition Era, he was grilling a visit\u00ad ing bootlegger in his room at the Princeton Inn when a sophomore tele\u00ad phoned to place an order and gave his name and address before he realized it was Kopliner he was talking to: So just take care in buying wine To see that Mike's not on the line. Mike became head proctor in 1945. One May in the 1950s he got word that some undergraduates were planning to disrupt the customary R.O.T.C. review near Palmer Stadium. He took a strate\u00ad gic position on the lower Campus, and, a few minutes before the review was to start, heard an approaching cadence: \"Hip-two-three-four ...\" Presently, around 1915 Hall came five under\u00ad graduates in Confederate uniforms, with a Confederate flag, a snare drum, a sword, and two rifles. Mike hurried ahead on the road to the Stadium and at the Vivarium below Guyot drew a chalk line. When the invading Confederates arrived, he said, \"Look, boys. Up to this point you've had a lot of fun. You go beyond this line and you're in trouble. What do you intend to do?\" Then, ac\u00ad cording to Mike's tape-recorded memoirs, the student with the sword turned to the others and said, \"Well, boys, we have met the enemy and we are theirs.\" Mike died of cancer, at age 63, in the summer of 1960. The previous fall, be\u00ad tween the halves of a football game, the band had demonstrated the respect and affection in which he was held by form\u00ad ing a giant K as they played the Proc\u00ad tor's Song. In 1960 the proctors and the campus police were placed under the supervi\u00ad sion of a new officer, the director of se\u00ad curity. Incumbents of this post have been Walter Dodwell, former member of the New Jersey State Police, 1960- 1969; Allan N. Kornblum, former spe\u00ad vestigation, 1969-1975; Jerrold L. Wit- sil, former director of public safety at the University of Maryland, 1975- Mike Kopliner's son, James M. Kop\u00ad liner '51, a former borough policeman, has been Assistant Director of Security since 1965. By 1977 the University security department numbered ninety-nine persons, including the director, two assistant directors, the chief of the uniformed division, the captain of Forrestal security, eight security ser\u00ad geants, sixty security officers, four proctor supervisors, eighteen proctors, and four secretaries. Prospect, once the home of the presi\u00ad dent and now a social center for Uni\u00ad versity faculty, administration, and staff, was acquired by the College in 1878. At that time it occupied a thirty- acre estate that extended as far east as the present site of Woodrow Wilson School. The land on which Prospect stands was originally part of a large tract owned by Richard Stockton, one of the first settlers of Princeton and grand-394 THE PROVOST father of Richard Stockton 1748 (q.v.). It was later acquired by Benjamin Fitz- Randolph, who conveyed it to his son, Nathaniel FitzRandolph (q.v.). Still later the property was deeded to Colonel George Morgan, western ex\u00ad plorer, United States Agent for Indian Affairs, and gentleman farmer. Morgan built a stone farmhouse on the crest of the hill and, observing the superb view of the landscape to the east, called it \"Prospect.\" Colonel Morgan's estate became fa\u00ad mous in Revolutionary times as \"Pros\u00ad pect near Princeton.\" A delegation of ten Delaware Indian chieftains spent a few days in wigwams on its lawns as guests of Colonel Morgan in 1779, pre\u00ad paratory to going to Philadelphia to confer with Continental Congress. Some two thousand mutinous soldiers of the Pennsylvania Line pitched camp there in 1781, also en route to Philadelphia to demand a redress of their grievances. Continental Congress held a number of its sessions at Pros\u00ad pect in 1783 before establishing itself in Nassau Hall. John Potter, a wealthy merchant from Charleston, South Carolina, ac\u00ad quired Prospect in 1824. In 1849, his son, Thomas F. Potter replaced Colo\u00ad nel Morgan's stone farmhouse with the present mansion, which was de\u00ad signed by John Notman in the Floren\u00ad tine style, much used at that time for country residences. The grounds were laid by an Englishman named Petrey who, according to Mrs. Allan Mar- quand, undoubtedly planned the flower garden and brought over the beautiful Cedar of Lebanon, the large hawthorn, and the fine English yew, on the west of the house. In 1878 Alexander and Robert L. Stuart, wealthy Scottish-American merchants and Presbyterian-minded philanthropists, bought Prospect and presented it to the College for use as the residence of President McCosh and his successors. McCosh thought it the finest college president's house in the world and on leaving it said he felt like Adam leaving Eden. In the 1890s Pres\u00ad ident Patton kept a cow and pastured it where Palmer Hall now stands. Pros\u00ad pect's Eden-like qualities diminished with the passing years. Undergraduates going to their eating clubs took short cuts across the Prospect grounds and one year football crowds trampled on the garden. The following summer (1904) President Wilson had an iron fence built around the Prospect grounds, enclosing five acres of the Campus, to the annoyance of under\u00ad graduates who tore part of it down. Mrs. Wilson made over the garden ap\u00ad proximately in its present form and planted the background of evergreens. One spring night in 1925, a caravan of student cars drove through the Pros\u00ad pect grounds to protest an edict of the trustees banning automobiles from the Campus, and during a spring riot in the early sixties undergraduates tore down a section of the fence at the back of the garden. After the official residence of the president was changed to the Walter Lowrie House (q.v.) in 1968, Prospect was converted for the social use of the faculty and administration, and later of all full-time University employees. The president continued to use its grounds for official receptions at the opening of the University in September and at Commencement.

The position was created by the trustees in 1966 to per\u00ad mit the president to share more of his administrative load so that he might have time for the essential task of shap\u00ad ing educational policies.

For such a relatively young discipline, Psy\u00ad chology's history at Princeton is surpris\u00ad ingly long. In the 1868 catalog, Psy\u00ad chology was listed as a required course for the Junior class and for the next two decades was taught by President James McCosh, assisted by Professors Henry Fairfield Osborn and William Berryman Scott. In 1893 a laboratory for experimental psychology was estab\u00ad lished under J. Mark Baldwin. Housed in Nassau Hall, it thrived as a center for research and scholarship in the then- fledgling science. The Psychological Review, founded jointly by Baldwin and by Cattell of Columbia University in 1894, soon became the leading pub\u00ad lication in American psychology. Following a pattern that developed throughout the western world, psy\u00ad chology was initially treated as a sub- field of philosophy. When the de\u00ad partmental system was instituted by President Wilson in 1904, psychology was taught as part of the philosophy department. In 1915, it received rec\u00ad ognition in the title, the Department of Philosophy and Psychology. Finally, in 1920, a Department of Psychology was established, largely through the efforts of Howard C. Warren (q.v.), who was its first chairman. The next step was to find a home for the burgeoning science, and in 1924 Eno Hall became the first university building in America to be devoted en\u00ad tirely to experimental psychology. There Psychology remained and grew until 1963, when Green Hall, the former engineering building, was reno\u00ad vated to house the Departments of Psychology and Sociology, and Psy\u00ad chology began occupying every nook and cranny of its part of this large build\u00ad ing. But important as space and facilities are, the department's real history lies in the contributions of its faculty and students. From the beginning Psychol\u00ad ogy at Princeton has been among the foremost programs in the country. McCosh was one of the first to bring the \"new\" experimental psychology of the German psychologists Wundt and Fechner to the attention of scholars in this country. Baldwin continued this tradition, studying both with Wundt and with McCosh, and then went on to become one of this country's most dis\u00ad tinguished psychologists, serving as president of the American Psychologi\u00ad cal Association in 1898. Warren was no less eminent, serving also as president in 1913. Warren was succeeded as chairman of the department by Herbert Langfeld, whose textbook, written with Boring and Weld, was considered the first modern survey-introduction to psychology. Under Langfeld, the department's progrm was further strengthened by the appointment of such men as Ernest Wever, pioneer in the study of hearing; Hadley Cantril, noted for his work in public opinion and his study of people's reactions to Orson 396 PUBLIC LECTURES Welles's Martian invasion broadcast; and Harold Gulliksen, one of the coun\u00ad try's foremost authorities on mental testing. This blend of theoretical and practi\u00ad cal interests continued under the chairmanships of Carroll Pratt, Hadley Cantril, and John L. Kennedy in the two decades following the Second World War. During this period Sylvan Tomkins, a leading figure in personality theory and assessment, brought Freud, Jung, and Adler alive for hundreds of enthralled undergraduates. Frank GeI- dard came from the University of Vir\u00ad ginia, expanding the department's scope by his work on cutaneous percep\u00ad tion and communication. The department began to take on a new character and form after it moved to Green Hall in 1963. For the first time laboratories could be built and equipped to house the various new branches of rapidly developing experimental psychology. Professors John L. Ken\u00ad nedy and Joseph M. Notterman, who were instrumental in planning and supervising the building's reconstruc\u00ad tion, also brought in young scientists to expand the department's coverage of modern psychology. In 1968, Leon J. Kamin assumed the chairmanship with a clear mandate to build on the solid foundation that already existed. Since then, the department has concentrated on four major areas: physiological psy\u00ad chology and the neurosciences, social psychology, cognitive processes and perception, and the psychology of learning and motivation. In addition, the study of behavioral development has been emphasized within each of these areas. The decision to build depth as well as breadth resulted in a vigorous and popular department. Interdisciplinary research and scholarship has flour\u00adished, with faculty and students work\u00ad ing across traditional lines: biology and biochemistry have become part and parcel of the work in neuroscience; lin\u00ad guistics and anthropology an integral part of work in cognition; mathematics and computer sciences a necessary and useful tool in the study of memory, perception and learning. Student interest has grown corre\u00ad spondingly. In the early 1970s, Leon J. Kamin's introductory psychology lec\u00ad tures averaged over 300 students. John M. Darley and Joel Cooper attracted as many to each of their courses in Social Psychology and Personality, respec\u00ad tively, and the faculty were trying to keep pace with 150 undergraduate con\u00ad centrators. Despite the constriction of the academic job market, the depart\u00ad ment attracted many more graduate students than could be accommodated, and it had an enviable record in placing its Ph. D.'s in suitable positions throughout the country. President McCosh would have been pleased with the growth and development of ex\u00ad perimental psychology at Princeton. Even though psychology was no longer thought of as Mental Philosophy, McCosh's spirit of vigorous inquiry and teaching and his commitment to excel\u00ad lence and service continued to prevail. Sam Glucksberg Public lectures on topics of general in\u00ad terest are provided by five special en\u00ad dowments given by the following alumni and friends of the University: in 1891 by Spencer Trask 1866; in 1899 by Henry Stafford Little 1844, donor also of the Stafford Little dormitory; in 1912 by Louis Clark Vanuxem 1879; in 1939 by George L. Farnum 1894; and in 1957 by the family of Governor Walter E. Edge.

Milliken '11 (Cleveland Museum of Art). John B. Putnam, Jr. '45, who came to Princeton from Cleveland, Ohio, left college at the end of his sophomore year to enlist in the Army Air Corps. He made a brilliant record as a squad\u00ad ron flight leader with the Eighth Fighter Command in England, winning the Distinguished Flying Cross and the MOSES TAYLOR PYNE 399 Air Medal with six Oak Leaf Clusters. He was killed in a crash in England shortly after D Day in 1944. Pyne, Moses Taylor (1855-1921), gave to his Alma Mater so generously of himself and his means that it was once said of him (by Cambridge Vice- Chancellor Sir Arthur Shipley) that he did more for Princeton than any other man had done for any college. A man of great inherited wealth, ac\u00ad cumulated originally by his maternal grandfather, Moses Taylor (first presi\u00ad dent of the National City Bank of New York and the principal stockholder in the Delaware, Lackawanna and West\u00ad ern Railroad Company), Pyne devoted most of his adult life, and much of his fortune, to helping Princeton grow from a college into a university. During his thirty-six years on the Board of Trustees he did not miss a single meet\u00ad ing. A member of the famous Class of 1877, Pyne acquired at Princeton a last\u00ad ing taste for Latin and Greek. A year after receiving his LL. B. at Columbia Law School in 1879, he married Mar- garetta Stockton, a great-great- granddaughter of Richard Stockton 1748 (q.v.), and became general coun\u00ad sel for the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad Company. In 1891 he resigned from this office in order to give more time to his other interests, especially Princeton. Pyne was elected to the Princeton Board of Trustees in 1884, when he was twenty-eight. His election was en\u00ad gineered by President McCosh, who told Pyne's classmate, Henry Fairfield Osborn, that the Board was \"full of old dotards\" and that it badly needed \"a fine young man\" like Pyne. His first concern was to organize the alumni in support of the College. He collected, and stimulated others to col\u00adlect, information about alumni, which resulted in rich archival material and comprehensive address lists\u2014a forma\u00ad tive contribution to the present-day University Archives and Bureau of Alumni Records. With his classmate, Professor William Libbey, Jr., he pre\u00ad pared and published in 1888 the first edition of the modern Alumni Direc\u00ad tory. He was one of the founders and first presidents of the Princeton Club of New York and helped establish other alumni associations throughout the country. In 1900 he took a leading part in the adoption of the plan for electing alumni trustees, and in the founding of the Alumni Weekly, serving as first chairman of its executive committee. In 1905 he was one of the organ\u00ad izers of the Committee of Fifty, the original forerunner of the Alumni Council. His classmate, Henry Fair\u00ad field Osborn, said Pyne \"virtually cre\u00ad ated the modern alumni spirit\" at Princeton. As chairman of the trustees' commit\u00ad tee on grounds and buildings, Pyne exerted a strong influence in favor of the use, originally suggested by Dean West, of collegiate Gothic for the build\u00ad ings which were erected at the time of the Sesquicentennial in 1896. Two of these he himself built and gave to the University; they were named Upper and Lower Pyne in his honor (q.v.). Another was the Pyne Library, which he persuaded his mother to give. Later, as chairman of the trustees' committee on finance, Pyne sought the necessary funds to finance President Wilson's preceptorial system and dipped into his own pocket yearly to meet whatever deficit remained. To provide housing for the influx of the original preceptors and other new fac\u00ad ulty members, he acquired the neces\u00ad sary land and built twenty-three houses in the Broadmead section of town. 400 MOSES TAYLOR PYNE These he rented at modest charges dur\u00ad ing his lifetime and bequeathed to the University on his death. At the same time Pyne took a deep interest in furthering Dean Wests plans for the development of a residen\u00ad tial graduate college. In 1905 he ac\u00ad quired Merwick, a mansion on Bayard Lane, which he made available to the University rent-free as a residence hall for graduate students, pending the erection of the Graduate College. When President Wilson proposed the Quad Plan for undergraduates in 1907, Pyne favored an experimental ap\u00ad proach, but opposed its total adoption at that time because of the trustees' prior commitment to provide a residen\u00ad tial graduate college. After ex-president Grover Cleve\u00ad land's death in 1908, Pyne gave up the finance committee chairmanship to take Cleveland's place as chairman of the committee on the graduate school. In this capacity he sided with Dean West's proposal to locate the graduate college at a distance from the main campus\u2014in opposition to Wilson's wish to have it integrated with the under\u00ad graduate college. On reunion day in 1910, in recogni\u00ad tion of Pyne's twenty-five years of ex\u00ad traordinary service as trustee, the alumni presented him with a hand- wrought gold cup, eighteen inches high, its body ornamented with tiger lilies, its cover surmounted by a tiger resting on a base of four University shields. President Wilson, who made the presentation, told Pyne: \"It has been in no small part through the stimulation of your example that hun\u00ad dreds of Princeton men have learned how to translate their affection into ac\u00ad tion.\" Pyne replied that when he thought of men like James McCosh and Grover Cleveland, he could only say, \"What have I done that you should thus honor me? Non sum dignus, amici.\" After Wilson's resignation in the fall of 1910, Pyne was urged by his friends to accept the presidency of the Univer\u00ad sity, but he refused because he felt he could be more useful as a trustee. He continued his efforts on behalf of the Graduate School, contributing funds for the construction of the Pyne Tower at the Graduate College and for the en\u00ad dowment of a professorship. After World War I he took a leading part as contributor and canvasser in the 1919 endowment campaign. Pyne's generos\u00ad ity to the University was matched by many acts of kindness, frequently anonymous, on behalf of faculty, students, alumni, and townspeople. A New York Evening Post editor, reflect\u00ad ing on Pyne's benefactions, wrote: \"He went around doing good as Pater said of Leonardo, like a man on a secret er\u00ad rand.\" Pyne's estate, \"Drumthwacket,\" was for many years the focus for much of the social life of the University and the town. The grounds were always open to visitors, and many a Princetonian spent pleasant hours strolling along the path that led from a rustic gate on Lover's Lane past a deer park and through the woods to a series of small lakes amid flower gardens. During Pyne's last illness, the trus\u00ad tees voted to name the first of the new post-World War I dormitories, then under construction, in his honor, and President Hibben was able to tell him of their intention and to secure his con\u00ad sent before he died. The day he was buried, the whole community joined in tribute. Univer\u00ad sity activities were suspended and all business stopped on Nassau Street. After the services at Drumthwacket the funeral cortege drove slowly through DAVID RAMSAY 401 the grounds of the Graduate College, past the site of the Pyne Dormitory, by Upper and Lower Pyne, to the Fitz- Randolph Gateway where it entered the Campus. To the tolling of the Nas\u00ad sau Hall bell the procession passed through a student guard of honor to the steps of Nassau Hall, then westward around the rear of the building, and through the arches of Pyne Library, and then back to Nassau Street. After the procession left the Campus, the students walked down Witherspoon street in a body to the cemetary where they encircled the grave and awaited the arrival of the cortege. In addition to the buildings and the professorship that bear his name, Pyne is remembered by the Pyne Honor Prize (q.v.), founded in 1921. His por\u00ad trait hangs in Procter Hall of the Graduate College. Pyne Hall, one of the largest under\u00ad graduate dormitories, enjoys the further distinction of having been in 1969 the first to house female candi\u00ad dates for bachelor degrees. It was de\u00ad signed by Day and Klauder and built in 1922 with funds given by the alumni. Entries are designated as gifts of the Classes of 1902, 1906, 1908, 1912, 1920, 1921, 1922, and 1923. It was named in memory of Moses Taylor Pyne 1877, a trustee of the University and one of its most generous benefac\u00ad tors (q.v.). Pyne Honor Prize, The, established in 1921 by Mrs. May Taylor Moulton Hanrahan and named for her cousin M. Taylor Pyne, is awarded annually by the president on Alumni Day to that member of the senior class who has most clearly manifested excellent scholarship and effective support of the best interests of the University. It is the highest general distinction conferred upon an undergraduate. Among those awarded the prize in earlier years were Charter Trustee H. Chapman Rose '28, President Robert F. Goheen '40, and United States Senator Paul S. Sarbanes '54. Reflect\u00ad ing the larger undergraduate body and the greater diversity of its interests, the prize in recent years has sometimes been shared by two or three seniors. Howard W. Bell, Jr. '70 was the first black to receive the prize, and Marsha H. Levy '73, the first woman. Ramsay, David 1765 (1749-1815), physician, patriot, and historian, deliv\u00ad ered what was probably the first Fourth of July oration ever given in America. The son of a Scotch-Irish Pennsylva\u00ad nia farmer, Ramsay graduated from Princeton at the age of sixteen, and taught school for five years before un\u00ad dertaking the study of medicine at the College of Philadelphia. After receiving his bachelor of physic degree, he went to Charlestown, South Carolina, bear\u00ad ing a letter from his friend and medical teacher, Benjamin Rush 1760 (q.v.), who said he was \"far superior to any person we ever graduated at our col\u00ad lege.\" His practice in Charlestown was successful and his permanent contribu\u00ad tions to medicine were recognized in 1789 when Yale granted him an honor\u00ad ary M. D. He was also active in politics, serving in the assembly and senate of South Carolina and the Continental Congress. It was as an historian, however, that Ramsay made his most notable contri\u00ad bution. His works included The History of the Revolution of South Carolina (1785), History of the American Revolu\u00ad tion (1789), The History of South Carolina (1809), and History of the United States, which remained unfin-402 TAPPING REEVE ished at his death and was completed by his brother-in-law, S. Stanhope Smith (q.v.). (The second of Ramsay's three wives, all of whom predeceased him, was\u2014like Mrs. Smith\u2014a daugh\u00ad ter of John Witherspoon.) Modern historical scholarship has tended to dismiss the histories of the Revolution written by Ramsay, William Gordon, and others, but some histo\u00ad rians have insisted on the importance of these early histories nevertheless. \"What matters,\" Professor Frank Cra\u00ad ven has said, \"is that they were written and read, and that they present the first attempts by Americans to deal com\u00ad prehensively with an important seg\u00ad ment of our common history.\" In 1965 Professor Page Smith of the University of California at Los Angeles published an extensive study of Ram\u00ad say's History of the American Revolu\u00ad tion in which he stressed the advantage that accrued to Ramsay through his in\u00ad volvement in the events of which he wrote and the wisdom he exercised in availing himself of this opportunity. \"The generosity of mind and spirit which marks his pages, his critical sense, his balanced judgment and com\u00ad passion,\" Professor Smith concluded, \"are gifts that were uniquely his own and that clearly entitle him to an hon\u00ad orable position in the front rank of American historians.\" The Independence Day oration be\u00ad lieved to be the first delivered in the United States was given by Ramsay on July 4, 1778. A century later it was as\u00ad serted by some that William Gordon had delivered the first such oration in Boston in 1777. But the Reverend Mr. Gordon's discourse was a sermon, on a text from the third book of Kings in the Old Testament, preached before the General Court of Massachusetts, whereas Dr. Ramsay's was an oration on \"the Advantages delivered Publick As\u00ad sembly of the Inhabitants of Charles- town in South Carolina\"\u2014a more likely forerunner of the Fourth of July ora\u00ad tions that became a part of the Ameri\u00ad can tradition. Reeve, Tapping 1763 (1744-1823) was the founder of one of America's earliest and most important law schools. A classmate of the eminent jurist, Wil\u00ad liam Paterson, Reeve taught for a number of years after graduation before going to Connecticut to read law in the office of Judge Root in Hartford. In 1773, he married Sally Burr, the daughter of Princeton's second presi\u00ad dent, and moved to Litchfield. He began giving law instruction in his office\u2014his brother-in-law, Aaron Burr, Jr. 1772, was one of his first students \u2014and in 1784, to accommodate a grow\u00ad ing number of students, built a cottage next to his house, which became known as the Litchfield Law School. Although not the first institution for instruction in the law\u2014the first Ameri\u00ad can chair of law was established at the College of William and Mary in 1779\u2014Reeve's school represented a major advance in the development of legal education in this country. Reeve operated the school single- handedly until 1798, when he was ap\u00ad pointed to the Connecticut Supreme Court (of which he was later Chief Jus\u00ad tice). He then invited James Gould, Yale 1791, who had just graduated from the school, to join him in its manage\u00ad ment. Reeve and Gould attracted stu\u00ad dents from almost every state in the Union, who came by horseback, steamboat, and stage to study law in their unheated, one-room school. Stu\u00ad dents received systematic instruction, DEPARTMENT OF RELIGION 403 with carefully prepared lectures and moot courts for practical instruction. The school trained some of the most eminent men in public life in the early nineteenth century, including in addi\u00ad tion to Aaron Burr, John C. Calhoun, Horace Mann, Noah Webster. It num\u00ad bered among its some 1,000 graduates sixteen United States senators, fifty congressmen, forty justices of higher state courts, two justices of the United States Supreme Court, ten governors, and five cabinet officers. Tapping Reeve retired from active connection with the school in 1820 when he was 76. Gould continued to lecture until 1833 when growing phys\u00ad ical infirmity obliged him to close the school. Other law schools meantime had been founded at Harvard (1817), and Yale (1824). Tapping Reeve's house and the law school are still standing in Litchfield. Registrar, The, has been an officer of the College and the University since 1840. Originally he was a recent graduate who held the office briefly while also serving as tutor. Henry Nevius van Dyke 1872 (no relation to Henry van Dyke, the author) was the first long-term registrar; he served from 1873 to 1910. He was followed by Charles J. Jones '00, 1910-1918, who was succeeded by Fred LeRoy Hutson, 1918-1925. Hutson was known for his compassion. \"He never stoops to rul\u00ad ings mean,\" the seniors sang in their Faculty Song, \"We wish to God they'd make him Dean.\" Another spring they took a different turn: \"If he had his dope down straight, /Half the class would get the gate.\" Hutson's succes\u00ad sors have been Wilbur F. Kerr, W. Stepp, 1947-1969, and Bruce Finnie, 1969-During van Dyke's tenure the regis\u00ad trar was first given an office of his own, located in Stanhope Hall. The regis\u00ad trar's office was moved to Nassau Hall in 1911 and to West College in 1959. Originally the registrar kept the aca\u00ad demic records of undergraduates only. Since 1970 the registrar has also kept the records of graduate students, pre\u00ad viously the responsibility of the office of the dean of the graduate school. Religion, The Department of. Speak\u00ad ing at the 1957 Alumni Day Luncheon in honor of Harold W. Dodds who was soon to retire as president, President Pusey of Harvard said: Because of a blindness which has infected much of modern education, Princeton appeared almost alone to be blazing a new trail when she set out to build a strong Department of Religion. This may well prove in time to have been not the least mem\u00ad orable achievement of an administra\u00ad tion filled by constructive advance. President Pusey was referring to a development in American higher edu\u00ad cation little noted outside Princeton in 1940, but by the early 1950s frequently emulated by many private colleges and universities and, more recently, by state universities and colleges. By the appointment of George F. Thomas in 1940 as the University's first Professor of Religious Thought, Princeton was recognizing the lack of specific instruction in religion since the nineteenth century, when it had been taught as part of other academic disci\u00ad plines, such as philosophy, literature, and history. More importantly, the University was affirming, in the words of the faculty committee created in 1935 to study the matter, that \"the 404 DEPARTMENT OF RELIGION study of religion . . . is an intellectual discipline, and as such has a proper place in the curriculum of instruction of a university which pretends to devote itself to liberal studies.\" Since the appointment of Thomas in 1940, the creation of a department in 1945, and the establishment of a graduate program in 1955, a strong group of teacher-scholars have together established the department's interna\u00ad tional reputation for excellent instruc\u00ad tion and scholarship in religion. George Thomas in the Philosophy of Religion and R. B. Y. Scott in the Old Testament were honored authorities in their disci\u00ad plines when they retired in 1968. Others, Horton M. Davies and John F. Wilson in the History of Christianity; Paul Ramsey in Religious Ethics; Mal\u00ad colm L. Diamond and Victor Preller in the Philosophy of Religion; and Philip H. Ashby in the History of Religion, have striven to maintain the standards of excellence of Scott and Thomas. They, and their junior colleagues, know that they are engaged in a still pioneer\u00ad ing and exciting endeavor. They re\u00ad ceive frequent inquiries from other universities seeking to learn from Princeton's past experience, present methods, and future plans. Other members of the faculty have gone on to Brown, Duke, Harvard, Pennsylvania, Syracuse, the University of California at Los Angeles, Yale, and other univer\u00ad sities from which they report that their Princeton experience was invaluable in developing their conception of religion as an academic discipline in the hu\u00ad manities. But what of the undergraduate pro\u00ad gram, the primary reason for the de\u00ad partment's existence? During Thomas's first year at Princeton, 21 students elected courses in religion. Fifteen years later, in 1955, over 700 students took at least one course in the depart\u00ad ment and 28 upperclassmen concen\u00ad trated in religion. In the 1960s and 70s yearly enrollments were as high as 1300, with as many as 69 concentrators. The majority of students concentrating in religion head toward careers in medicine, law, teaching, and business; they study religion because they rec\u00ad ognize, in the words of the faculty committee of 1935, that it \"is an inde\u00ad pendent power, the study of which is worthy of an independent place . . . as an element of liberal culture and as one of the humanities.\" Nor has Princeton been content to pioneer only in the undergraduate study of religion. Since the establish\u00ad ment of the graduate program in 1955, Princeton, along with a few other uni\u00ad versities not associated with divinity schools or seminaries, has been a leader in establishing high standards for the scholarly study of religion. Its Ph. D.'s now teach in colleges and universities in the United States, Canada, Aus\u00ad tralia, Japan, and the Union of South Africa. A comparative study of graduate education in religion sponsored by the American Council of Learned Societies in 1971 reported: \"Princeton is clearly established in the front rank according to all the objective indices and has been the most rigorously disciplined.\" The 1935 faculty committee's careful study of the place of religion in the study of the humanities, the appoint\u00ad ment of George F. Thomas with his dedication to teaching and concern for scholarly rigour, the vigorous support of Presidents Dodds, Goheen, and Bowen\u2014all of these have combined to establish Princeton as the leader in an area of study that before 1940 was al\u00ad most totally ignored by the leading uni\u00ad versities of America. Philip H. Ashby UNIVERSITY RESEARCH BOARD 405 Research Board, University, a uni\u00ad versity-wide committee formed in 1959, is composed of members of the faculty and administration. The Board, advisory to the president, recommends policy in the acceptance and adminis\u00ad tration of research grants and contracts throughout the University and gives general supervision to the implementa\u00ad tion of policy. Its administrative arm is the Office of Research and Project Ad\u00ad ministration, formed at the same time as the Board. During its existence the Board has supervised sponsored research on a remarkable variety of subjects. Com\u00ad puterized music and an orbiting as\u00ad tronomical observatory; the editing of the Thoreau papers and the engineer\u00ad ing application of laser beams; conti\u00ad nental drift and Fifth Century BC exca\u00ad vations Sicily; moon rocks and the luminescence of fireflies\u2014these repre\u00ad sent but a few of the more than 700 re\u00ad search projects that have fallen within its oversight annually. The Boards immediate predecessor was the Committee on Project Re\u00ad search and Invention, which had been established in 1946 under a directive from George A. Brakeley, vice presi\u00ad dent and treasurer of the University. Initial membership included Brakeley, Kenneth H. Condit (Dean of Engineer\u00ad ing), Henry DeW. Smyth (Chairman of the Department of Physics), Hugh S. Taylor (Dean of the Graduate School), who served as first chairman, and Raymond J. Woodrow, who was execu\u00ad tive officer and secretary. When the Research Board succeeded the Project Research Committee in 1959, Professor Smyth, who had served as chairman of the committee for sev\u00ad eral years, became the Board's first chairman, serving, as have his succes\u00ad sors, with the rank of dean. The new Board was drawn from the faculty (some appointed by the president and some elected by the faculty) as well as from the senior administration. The other original members were Ricardo A. Mestres (University Treasurer), Raymond Woodrow, Carlos H. Baker (English), Joseph R. Strayer (History), Donald F. Hornig (Chemistry), Lester V. Chandler (Economics), Arthur K. Parpart (Biology), and Joseph C. Elgin (Dean of Engineering). Smyth served as Chairman through June 1966. His successors have been Lyman Spitzer, Jr. (Astrophysical Sci\u00ad ences), 1966-1972, Sheldon Judson Sciences), 1972-1977, and Robert M. May (Biol\u00ad ogy) since September 1, 1977. By 1976 about $50 million was being spent annually on sponsored research. Of this amount, $30 million went to the Plasma Physics Laboratory on the For- restal Campus for its attempts to con\u00ad trol fusion as a peaceful energy source, and some $20 million of sponsored re\u00ad search was conducted by the several departments and programs on the main campus. About 95 percent of the funds represented federal grants and con\u00ad tracts. Exclusive of Plasma Physics, 54 percent of the research funds were for Natural Sciences, 29 percent, En\u00ad gineering and Applied Science, 12 per\u00ad cent, Humanities and Social Science, and 5 percent, Interdepartmental Pro\u00ad grams. Through various subcommittees, the University Research Board has over\u00ad sight of expenditures from the Higgins Trust (shared equally with Columbia, Harvard and Yale), the Scientific Re\u00ad search Fund of the University, as well as institutional grants from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. In addition, the Board ensures the conformance of Uni-406 R.O.T.C. versity practice with certain govern\u00ad mental regulations such as, for exam\u00ad ple, those governing research involving experimentation with animals, the use of human subjects, and the use of bio- hazardous materials. The Board origi\u00ad nally had supervision of the senior pro\u00ad fessional and technical staffs that are organized into ladders parallel with those of the faculty. In 1975 this func\u00ad tion was transferred to a committee (with the University Research Board Chairman as presiding officer), which reported to the dean of the faculty. This group, informally known as the \"committee-of-seven,\" is a counterpart of the so-called \"committee-of-three,\" which advises the president on ap\u00ad pointments, promotions, and salaries of faculty members. Over the years, general policies for the conduct of sponsored research have developed, and the University Re\u00ad search Board reviews each piece of proposed research in the light of these policies, e.g., that research at Prince\u00ad ton should promote the education of students, both undergraduate and graduate, and that it should provide for the advancement of knowledge and for its preservation and dissemination. The University does not administer funds whose purpose and character cannot be publicly disclosed nor does it accept contracts or grants for the support of classified research except under the most extraordinary conditions. Sheldon Judson Reserve Officers Training Corps (R.O.T.C.) at Princeton began quietly in the fall of 1919 with the establish\u00ad ment of an army field artillery unit. Princeton was \"an ideal location\" for such a unit, according to Major John McMahon, Jr., the first Professor of Military Science and Tactics. \"It is out in the country where there is plenty of available land for riding,\" he wrote. \"The soft country roads are only a few minutes ride from the stables, thus af\u00ad fording the students a wonderful oppor\u00ad tunity to ride in the midst of the pleasantest surroundings.\" The military training unit under his command soon included a half dozen Regular Army officers, two dozen enlisted men, a bat\u00ad tery of French '75s, and ninety horses. The field artillery unit remained horse-drawn long after Nassau Street was clogged by automobiles; indeed, the first trucks did not make a caisson roll till 1937, and \"seventy horses\" were still listed in the 1940 catalogue. A course on Hippology and Military Law was offered in the 1922 catalogue (\"The conformation of the horse, lameness and disease, the teeth, bitting, stable hygiene, shoeing, gaits . . .\") and, about the same time, polo was established as an intercollegiate sport at Princeton (indoor champions in 1921) with polo ponies furnished the ROTC by the War Department. The start of the program in 1919, coming so soon after the Armistice that ended the \"war to end all wars,\" had not been a propitious time to start mili\u00ad tary training on the campus. Early en\u00ad rollments lagged, but an unlikely combination\u2014the Daily Princetonian and John Grier Hibben (\"We all pray . . . we may never have to undertake another war, but the fallacy of unpreparedness would be . . . a great national sin.\")\u2014urged students to par\u00ad ticipate. By late fall, 127 had enrolled, and in 1925 the number had grown to 600. By the time of Pearl Harbor, more than 2,000 Princetonians had been comissioned in the field artillery. Many of them served in World War II, and some gave their lives. One ROTC R.O.T.C. 407 graduate, Lt. Colonel John U. D. Page '26, later won the Medal of Honor and lost his life at the Pusan Reservoir in Korea. Suspended during World War II, the Army unit was reactivated in 1946\u2014 this time with 2\u00bd ton trucks and 105-mm. howitzers. With the establish\u00ad ment of a Naval ROTC unit in 1946 and an Air Force unit in 1951, ROTC became a significant presence on cam\u00ad pus, with annual reviews, military balls, and commissioning by the presi\u00ad dent as part of Class Day ceremonies. The Cold War and the draft exemption for ROTC students, along with the scholarships offered by the three serv\u00ad ices, and a chance for a commission, pushed enrollments to an all-time high of 1107 undergraduates in 1951. But even with the support given ROTC by Presidents Hibben and Dodds, there were always some who questioned the presence of a military training unit on a liberal arts campus. As early as 1927, an article in the Alumni Weekly had fore\u00ad shadowed the principal arguments later put forth against ROTC when it de\u00ad clared that to the furtherance of permanent peace, toward which the University . . . should constantly strive.\" In the 1950s these problems multi\u00ad plied. Faculty grew restive about grant\u00ad ing academic credit for ROTC courses; students were increasingly reluctant to give up one course a semester for ROTC; and a number of professional associations, most notably in engineer\u00ad ing, threatened not to accredit pro\u00ad grams that gave course credit for ROTC. The University, under the leadership of Dean J. Douglas Brown, made an effort to add academic sub\u00ad stance to ROTC by creating a series of special, alternative University-taught courses\u2014in psychology, politics, eco\u00ad nomics, and military history. Army and Air Force responded; but the Navy, which valued the \"readily employable ensign,\" did not. The \"Princeton Plan\" for reforming ROTC found little sup\u00ad port outside the University and, even locally, proved at best a short-run solu\u00ad tion to a mounting problem. In the 1960s, as Vietnam emerged as the great issue on campus, enrollments dwindled and tensions mounted. By 1964 there had been a 70 percent de\u00ad cline to only 334 in all three units. Stu\u00ad dent groups, the Undergraduate As\u00ad sembly, and members of the faculty began to insist upon an end to course credit for ROTC, as well as to de\u00ad partmental standing for ROTC pro\u00ad grams and faculty status for on-campus military officers. President Goheen ap\u00ad pointed a special faculty committee, which recommended such changes, and in the spring of 1969, the faculty overwhelmingly approved proposals that, in effect, converted ROTC into non-credit programs with the status of extra-curricular activities. The invasion of Cambodia in May 1970 (when there were a mere 113 stu\u00ad dents in ROTC) brought the high point of campus anti-militarism\u2014a firebomb- ing of the Armory. A month later, the trustees approved a proposal by faculty and students to terminate all three ROTC programs no later than June of 1972. Yet within a year\u2014paralleling the unanticipated pendulum swing of stu\u00ad dent opinion that came with the end of the draft and the winding down of the war\u2014students in a 1971 Under\u00ad graduate Assembly referendum voted in favor of retaining ROTC under the conditions set by the faculty in 1969. Although the Air Force and the Navy 408 RESIDENTIAL, DINING, SOCIAL FACILITIES were unwilling to accept the Universi\u00ad ty's requirements and closed down their programs, the Army agreed to the con\u00ad tract the trustees offered in June 1972. That fall ROTC quietly returned to Princeton\u2014not as field artillery and not for course credit, but as a non-credit elective program of officer education. Thereafter, growth was modest but sus\u00ad tained. By 1976, seventy-four students (thirteen of them women) were en\u00ad rolled, with the prospect of the first co-ed being commissioned in 1978. Richard D. Challener Residential, dining, and social facilities for undergraduates, which now occupy some fifty University buildings, were once concentrated in Nassau Hall, after the College of New Jersey moved to Princeton from Newark in 1756. All undergraduates lived in Nassau Hall (or had lodgings in town) until 1833, when the first dormitory, East College, was built. As other dor\u00ad mitories were erected, Nassau Hall in time was taken over exclusively for ad\u00ad ministrative and faculty use, but one or two students continued to live there as late as 1903. By 1973, when Spelman Halls, the first to offer apartment living, were completed, Princeton had built forty dormitories, all but six of which were still being used for their original pur\u00ad pose. Three had been razed: East Col\u00ad lege in 1896, Upper Pyne in 1963, and Reunion Hall in 1965. Three had been converted to other uses: Lower Pyne in 1950 for business offices, Seventy-Nine Hall and West College in the early 1960s for departments of instruction, and administrative offices, respectively. Nassau Hall also contained the Col\u00ad lege's dining room and kitchen (origi\u00ad nally in the basement, later in a con\u00adnecting wing) until 1804, when they were moved to the first floor of Philo\u00ad sophical Hall, built that year where Chancellor Green now stands. For a dozen years, starting in 1834, a second refectory, situated on William Street, supplied board at a cheaper rate for those desiring it (one dollar and fifty cents a week rather than the regular two dollars). Students called it the \"poor house.\" Meals in those early days were Spar\u00ad tan. Breakfast often consisted of bread and butter with coffee, supper of bread and butter with milk and occasionally chocolate. Students sometimes filled out their meagre evening fare by steal\u00ad ing chickens or turkeys in town and roasting them over their chamber fires\u2014a common college custom at that time. Mid-day dinner was more adequate, usually offering meat, fish, or poultry, potatoes, fresh vegtables in season, \"small beer and cyder,\" and sometimes for desert \"pye\" or cake. Not surprisingly, one of the rules for re\u00ad fectory conduct issued in 1759 directed that \"none shall eagerly catch at a share, but wait till he is served in turn.\" In diaries and in letters home, stu\u00ad dents complained about the poor qual\u00ad ity and sameness of their meals. In the 1840s their protest began taking a force\u00ad ful turn: at a given signal, up would go the windows and out would fly the ta\u00ad blecloths and all that was on them. Beginning in 1843 students were permitted to take their meals with families in town, where the cost was somewhat higher than in the college re\u00ad fectory, although in some cases, the col\u00ad lege catalog announced, \"select associa\u00ad tions of students have been formed, whose expenses do not exceed $1.25 a week.\" The college refectory gradually lost out in competition with the local board-RESIDENTIAL, DINING, SOCIAL FACILITIES 409 inghouses and was finally closed in 1856 (as Harvard's had been, for similar rea\u00ad sons, seven years earlier). The \"select associations of students\" in boarding- houses grew in number and gradually evolved into a system of eating clubs (q.v.). Attempts to revive the college commons in 1877 and 1891 failed, and it was not until 1906 and 1908 that first freshman, and then sophomore, com\u00ad mons were instituted in the old Univer\u00ad sity Hall. Their place in campus life was made more secure in 1916 by the erec\u00ad tion of Madison Hall (q.v.). WILSON'S QUAD PLAN Two years after introducing the pre\u00ad ceptorial system, President Wilson tried to translate its principles into a plan for the social reorganization of the University which he also hoped would check the domination of the eating clubs and thus rectify what he feared was \"the almost imperceptible and yet increasingly certain decline of the old democratic spirit of the place.\" The Quad Plan called for the establishment of residential quadrangles or colleges, each with its own dining hall, common room, resident master, and resident preceptors. Every undergraduate would be required to live in a college, the particular one to be determined by lot or assignment. Although the trus\u00ad tees approved the Quad Plan in princi\u00ad ple, they later withdrew their support in response to the opposition of club alumni and undergraduates, and their own concern about the cost. After the defeat of Wilson's Quad Plan, a campus center, strongly favored by President Hibben, was frequently urged as a means of improving the fab\u00ad ric of student life. Plans for a million dollar complex containing a University club, theater, and quarters for under\u00ad graduate activities were announced in the mid-twenties, but suspended dur\u00ad ing the depression. A campus center for servicemen established in Murray- Dodge during World War II continued in use for undergraduates until 1954 when the University created Chancel\u00ad lor Green Student Center (q.v.), reno\u00ad vating the north wing of Pyne Library for the cafeteria, and the large reading room in Chancellor Green Library for the main lounge. The Center's accessi\u00ad bility made it an instant success. To meet the heavy patronage of students, faculty, and staff, a second cafeteria was set up in the main lounge. When the legal age for drinking was lowered to eighteen in 1973, a pub was installed there also, and student bartenders began serving draught beer, wine, and soft drinks, and student cooks started to bake \"the best pizza in town.\" In the late 1960s a special committee of the trustees working with the faculty committee on undergraduate life con\u00ad cluded that more diverse social oppor\u00ad tunities were needed\u2014not only to re\u00ad duce the disproportionate emphasis on membership in the upperclass eating clubs but also to create an improved social environment for all under\u00ad graduates. These objectives soon began to take shape, and by the time the Uni\u00ad versity entered the seventies, it could offer students a variety of alternatives ranging from a modified version of the club life of earlier years to an approach to Wilson's ideal of residential colleges. Though some eating clubs became non\u00ad selective and two were converted in 1969 to a University-operated social facility, named Stevenson Hall (q.v.), others continued to maintain their former autonomy. Modern Princeton's first approach to the Quad Plan had come in 1968 with the creation of Wilson College (q.v.). Two years later when additional space 410 REUNION HALL was needed following the advent of coeducation, the Princeton Inn College (q.v.) was founded. Another option first offered in this period was the student-organized Madison Society, a low-cost alternative to the eating clubs that provided up to two hundred mem\u00ad bers varied dining opportunities\u2014 breakfast at Wilcox Hall, lunch at Com\u00ad mons or the Student Center, and \"candlelight and beer\" dinners in the restaurant atop the New South Build\u00ad ing. Some hardy \"independents\" pre\u00ad ferred to choose their own bill of fare, sometimes by shopping around in res\u00ad taurants, more often by cooking their meals in dormitory kitchens. All things considered, Princetonians of the 1970s were faring better than their hungry forebears in the lean days of the college refectory. Reunion Hall, a five-story dormitory, was built in 1870 to commemorate the reunion of the Old and New Schools of the Presbyterian Church. It was razed in 1965 after it had been condemned as a fire hazard. The space it occupied be\u00ad tween Stanhope Hall and West College has been left open. During his short stay at Princeton, John F. Kennedy (q.v.) lived in this dormitory. Reunions of alumni classes began soon after the Civil War,'and with them class gifts. At its tenth reunion the Class of 1859 endowed a senior prize in Eng\u00ad lish, and at its tenth, the Class of 1860 founded a graduate fellowship in ex\u00ad perimental science. When the Class of 1866 observed its decennial, it gave the College the clock in the cupola of Nas\u00ad sau Hall. By the 1890s class reunions at Com\u00ad mencement time had become fairly numerous. They were modest affairs at first: meetings held in classrooms in old Dickinson Hall or Nassau Hall, fol\u00ad lowed by a dinner in University Hall or the old Princeton Inn. Stimulated by an alumni torchlight procession at the Sesquicentennial (q.v.) which brought 2,000 alumni back to Princeton in 1896, attendance at reunions grew and pro\u00ad grams became more elaborate, some\u00ad times lasting two or three days. Houses were rented to accommodate class members, bands engaged for their en\u00ad tertainment (and to welcome class\u00ad mates arriving by train), and various means of identification gradually adopted\u2014class banners, hatbands, blazers, costumes. Later, beginning in the early 1950s, headquarters and sleeping quarters were provided on the Campus for most major reunions. Very early it became the custom for each class to have a major reunion at five-year intervals following gradua\u00ad tion. For these occasions alumni have made a determined effort to return to Princeton even from distant places. In between, at the \"off year\" reunions, a smaller number keep the pilot light burning. The twenty-fifth reunion, when most alumni have reached the peak of their careers, has come to be regarded as the most important of all, and the twenty- fifth year class has accordingly been given the place of honor at the head of the Alumni Parade (q.v.). The Class of 1942 dramatically demonstrated the importance of a twenty-fifth reunion when, in 1967, it gave more than $300,000 to Annual Giving (q.v.), the first class to do so. It brought back to its reunion that year another gift, the Nas\u00ad sau Hall bell clapper it had stolen in what was a traditional freshman year prank, and, having had the clapper split in two, gave half to the golden anniver\u00ad sary Class of 1917 and half to the graduating Class of 1967. REUNIONS 411 The fiftieth has come to be another big reunion. There is usually a large turnout of septuagenarians who step out briskly when the Alumni Parade leaves the front of Nassau Hall. One alumnus, Dr. William H. Vail 1865, walked fifty miles to attend his fiftieth, reaching the campus just in time to join his classmates in the Parade to and around University Field\u2014\"the last mile.\" The Class of 1887's sixty-fifth reunion dinner at Merwick, Bishop Matthews' home on Bayard Lane, was attended by five of the seven living members of the class and several relatives. It started out rather sadly, when one man noted that classmates had begun to drop off soon after the fiftieth reunion and that by the time the sixtieth came two- thirds had gone. Bishop Matthews served some excellent Burgundy (the class historian recorded) and spirits gradually lifted. Banter and jokes fol\u00ad lowed, and one of the sons present was moved to compliment himself on hav\u00ad ing picked '87 for his father's class. To\u00ad ward the end of the evening, following more stories and reminiscences, one man exclaimed that if President McCosh were present he would say that 1887 was the greatest class that ever graduated. Then after a few sec\u00ad onds' reflection, he wryly added, \"as he said of every class.\" The sixty-fifth is usually the last major reunion, although there is on re\u00ad cord at least one later one. In 1967, two members of the Class of 1897, Paul Bed\u00ad ford and Leander H. Shearer, sat down together in the lobby of the Princeton Inn and there received a formal visit from President Goheen on the occasion of their seventieth reunion. While a member of the faculty and during his presidency of the University, Woodrow Wilson 1879 attended all of his class's reunions. In 1914 he came up from Washington for his thirty-fifth, but in 1919, because he was in Paris for the Peace Conference, he was obliged to send his regrets to his classmates when they gathered for their fortieth. \"I shall miss what would be the greatest possible refreshment to me in meeting the boys then,\" he cabled his friend and classmate Robert Bridges a few days be\u00ad fore the reunion, \"and so I beg that you will give them the most affectionate messages from me and tell them how cheering it is to me always to think of their friendship and of the old days we spent together.\" Norman Thomas '05, clergyman and perennial Socialist candidate for presi\u00ad dent, rarely\u2014if ever\u2014missed a re\u00ad union of his class. \"Some things in life justify themselves emotionally, without necessity for analytic reasoning,\" he once said. \"On the whole, Princeton reunions fall in that category. In my moralizing moments, I may regret that reunions are too greatly inspired by the prayer: 'Make me a sophomore again just for tonight,' which prayer, with the aid of a sometimes excessive consump\u00ad tion of the spirituous, rather than the spiritual, often seems to be granted.\" Sometimes reunion days are ex\u00ad tended. In 1969 thirty classmates topped off the Class of 1939's thirtieth reunion by flying to Russia. There, ac\u00ad cording to the New York Times, they gave the first rendition of \"Old Nassau\" ever heard in Moscow University. Even more distant duties than Wil\u00ad son's in Paris have kept a class notable away. In 1973 astronaut Charles Con\u00ad rad, Jr., sent word to his reunion chairman that he could not be present at 1953's twentieth because \"he was out of town on business.\" He sent his mes\u00ad sage from the country's first space sta\u00ad tion, Skylab I, to the Johnson Space 412 RHODES SCHOLARSHIPS Center at Houston, which relayed it to Princeton. CLASS ATTENDANCE AWARDS In 1912 the Class of 1901 gave a silver cup to be awarded annually to the class having the largest proportion of its liv\u00ad ing members present at a reunion. At\u00ad tendance of winners has ranged from 52 percent (the Class of 1919 at its fiftieth) to 77.3 percent (the Class of 1898 at its twenty-fifth). The winner in 1916, the Class of 1866, had 18 of 27 classmates present at its fiftieth reunion; their at\u00ad tendance percentage was especially ap\u00ad propriate and pleasing to them: 66.66. Other awards were begun in the 1930s: the 1921 plaque for the greatest number at a major reunion, the Class of 1894 bowl for the largest percentage at an off-year reunion, the Class of 1915 cup for the greatest number at an off- year reunion. Another one was begun in 1967: the Class of 1912 trophy for the largest percentage present at the re\u00ad union of a class graduated more than fifty years. Rhodes Scholarships, for study at Ox\u00ad ford University in England, have been awarded to some 140 Princeton under\u00ad graduates since their founding early in this century. Each year, thirty-two American scholars are chosen from more than 600 applicants for their \"in\u00ad tellectual attainment, character, lead\u00ad ership, and physical vigor.\" In many years there have been at least two Princeton recipients, and frequently three or four, and in 1960 and 1976 there were five. In the twenty years be\u00ad tween 1950 and 1970, Princeton was represented every year. The Class of 1925 was represented by six Rhodes Scholars\u2014more than any other Princeton class. Princeton Rhodes Scholars have for the most part followed professional careers\u2014law, medicine, the ministry, and education. Those in public service have included Supreme Court Justice John M. Harlan '20, Career Ambas\u00ad sador William W. Butterworth, Jr. '25, Attorney General Nicholas enbach '43, and Senator Paul S. Sar- banes '54. There have been a number of college E. Stevenson '22 (Oberlin), Paul S. Ha\u00ad vens '25 (Wilson), Caleb F. Gates, Jr. '26 (University of Denver), James Harlan Cleveland '38 (University of Hawaii), and James McN. Hester '46 (New York University and United Na\u00ad tions University). Princeton called back seven Scholars to teach classics, Eng\u00ad lish, or history: Paul R. Coleman- Norton '19, Donald A. Stauffer '23, E.D.H. Johnson '34, Gordon A. Craig '36, James H. Billington '50, Arthur W. Litz, Jr. 51, and Neil L. Rudenstine '56 (later Provost). Among those in medicine have been two classmates in 1913: Wilder Penfield, the brain sur\u00ad geon, and Wilburt C. Davison, Dean of the Duke University Medical School, and among those in music, Frank E. Taplin '37, President of the Metropoli\u00ad tan Opera. Journalists include John B. Oakes '34, editor of the New York Times editorial page. Henry Allison Page III, Rhodes Scholar in 1935, was killed in action in World War II and awarded a Congres\u00ad sional Medal of Honor. Dan Sachs, Rhodes Scholar in 1960, who was an outstanding football player, died in 1967 after a three-year struggle with cancer. In his memory, friends, class\u00ad mates, and fellow football players estab\u00ad lished a scholarship enabling a graduat\u00ad ing senior who desires, like him, to go into public service, to study abroad, as he did. The best known Princeton Rhodes ROMANCE LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES 413 Scholar in recent years has been bas\u00ad ketball Ail-American and Olympic gold medalist Bill Bradley '65. Rittenhouse Orrery, The, one of Princeton's oldest instruments for the teaching of science, is on display in the lobby of Peyton Hall. Devised to repre\u00ad sent the motions of the planets about the sun, orreries were regarded as es\u00ad sential teaching equipment of eighteenth-century lecturers on \"natu\u00ad ral philosophy.\" They derived their name from the Earl of Orrery, for whom one of the most famous was built in England about 1713. Princeton's Rittenhouse Orrery is the first of two remarkably accurate or\u00ad reries made by the Pennsylvania clockmaker and self-educated as\u00ad tronomer, David Rittenhouse. He made the second one for the College of Philadelphia, now the University of Pennsylvania. Princeton's orrery was purchased by President Witherspoon and installed in Nassau Hall in 1771. It was damaged during the Revolution and later repaired. It was in active use for about a half-century; thereafter it became merely a curiosity and did not come to attention again until it was ex\u00ad hibited at the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893. Then it disappeared and was thought permanently lost until it was discovered, in 1948, still crated, in the basement of McCosh Hall. Through the generosity of Bernard Peyton '17, it was once more restored and given a place of honor in Firestone Library until Peyton Hall was built. In the restoration one concession was made to the twentieth century: electric motors were added to provide smooth motive power, thus eliminating the damage to the intricate wheelwork which in earlier days re\u00ad sulted from hasty and irregular turning of the crank that set the orrery in mo\u00ad tion. Romance Languages and Literatures, The Department of. The first romance language ever taught at Princeton was smuggled in by none other than Presi\u00ad dent John Witherspoon. As early as 1769, when only Hebrew, Greek, and Latin were respectable enough to war\u00ad rant inclusion in the curriculum, With\u00ad erspoon himself offered, free-of-charge, extracurricular instruction in French, as did also outside teachers who were engaged by the students for a fee. Not until 1830 did the College appoint a regular instructor of French and Spanish, Louis Hargous, who taught these languages until 1836. Hargous was followed by Benedict Jaeger, who became a one-man language depart\u00ad ment, offering German, Italian, French, and Spanish, all as Professor of Modern Languages, a rubric that lasted till 1958, when by amoeba-like fission the Department of Modern Languages divided into the two Departments of Germanic and Romance Languages and Literatures. Although Hargous, Jaeger, and their followers had faculty standing, no aca\u00ad demic credit was given for their offer\u00ad ings. A century after Witherspoon's early efforts, President McCosh made instruction in modern languages a regu\u00ad lar part of the curriculum for which credit was given. Finally, in 1904, Woodrow Wilson raised the living lan\u00ad guages to a par with the dead ones, when he created the present organiza\u00ad tion of departments, among them Modern Languages. During the administration of the first chairman, Williamson U. Vreeland, 1904 to 1913, Wilson summoned a gen\u00ad eration of fine teacher-scholars to the department: Christian Gauss (q.v.), 414 ROMANCE LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES Douglas L. Buflum, Donald Clive Stuart, and Percy A. Chapman. From here on, the stars in the department's Pleiade become too numerous to be ac\u00ad corded the space they deserve; but not to be forgotten is their predecessor, the inimitable Frank L. Critchlow (re\u00ad membered in the Faculty Song as \"hat- less, coatless, kids in hand\") who con\u00ad tributed rare humor, coupled with solid scholarship in the little-known Catalan language. Of the \"preceptor guys\" Wilson ap\u00ad pointed in 1905, Gauss was beyond question the most spectacular. He is remembered by alumni not only as a brilliant lecturer and preceptor but also as twice chairman of the department (1913-1936, 1943-1946), as dean of the college for almost twenty years, and as a wise expositor of American college life. A dozen years after the first precep\u00ad tors, two outstanding scholars were called from Johns Hopkins: Charles C. Marden, first Emory L. Ford Professor of Spanish, and Edward C. Armstrong. Marden became internationally known as editor, and twice as discoverer, of medieval Spanish texts. Armstrong was the founder of the famed Elliott mono\u00ad graphs in romance studies, and head of a research project on the medieval Alexander romances. Under Arm\u00ad strong's guidance as director, graduate studies prospered greatly. Among the first to earn Princeton Ph. D. 's in the early twenties were F. Courtney Tarr, later second Ford Professor, and Ira O. Wade, chairman from 1946 to 1958. For the first two decades, the de\u00ad partment was staffed primarily by na\u00ad tive Americans, but in 1923 it imported Augusto Centeno from Spain and Maurice Coindreau from France. Cen\u00ad teno became a popular lecturer and preceptor; Coindreau, through his sen\u00adsitive translations, acquainted France with American authors such as Faulk\u00ad ner, Hemingway, and Dos Passos. About this time Kenneth McKenzie accepted a professorship in Italian, and Alfred L. Foulet was called to assist Armstrong, whose Alexander studies he continued splendidly. A little later the department took in two young Princeton graduates who became fix\u00ad tures in their specialties: E. B. O. Borgerhoff in French classicism, and Raymond S. Willis in Spanish middle ages and renaissance. After 1930 the department's reputa\u00ad tion attracted an imposing array of scholars who served as visiting profes\u00ad sors, such as Andre Maurois, P. Laumonier, Salvador de Madariaga, and R. Lapesa. Under a different policy, Princeton called to tenure appointments three foreign scholars: a Frenchman, Gilbert Chinard; an Italian, Giuliano Bon- fante; and a Spaniard, Americo Castro. Bonfante's stay relatively brief; Chinard and pressions on Princeton. Chinard's spe\u00ad cialty was eighteenth-century America and its relations with France, and it created deep and lasting interest among students and faculty. Castro revolutionized Spanish historiography with his thesis that Spain was born of the symbiotic relationship of three medieval \"castes\": Christians, Mus\u00ad lims, and Jews. In the wake of World War II, far- reaching changes to the department took place. Language learning by lis\u00ad tening and speaking, as developed by the army, was instituted under the guidance of Archibald T. MacAllis- ter, Jr. Russian, a wartime innovation, was expanded into a field of literary study, chiefly by two women, Ludmilla Turkevich and Valentine Bill; and it ROBERT KILBURN ROOT 415 remained with Romance Languages until it was converted into an inde\u00ad pendent department in 1961. Another important postwar change was introduced by soft-spoken Ira Wade, who turned out to be a radical innovator, devising unprecedented schemes to convert young Americans into world citizens. With the coopera\u00ad tion of foreign business, students were placed in summer jobs in Europe and Latin America, and they also did re\u00ad search there on anything from labor problems to contemporary poetry. Wade's Special Program in European Civilization (including Latin America at first) eventually enlisted the collabora\u00ad tion of four social science and six hu\u00ad manistic departments, from whose of\u00ad ferings students tailored their own pro\u00ad grams on the civilization of a foreign land. Even after the separation of German and Russian, the department steadily increased its offerings. By 1974 it pre\u00ad sented seventy undergraduate, one- term courses for which there were 2,000 student elections. The program included French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish; also offered were linguis\u00ad tics, European literature in English translations, and, at the graduate level, medieval Provencal and Catalan litera\u00ad ture. Faculty recruitments, beginning in the late 1940s, strengthened the de\u00ad partment in medieval and modern lan\u00ad guages, literature, civilization, and lin\u00ad guistics. They included Blanchard W. Bates, Edward D. Sullivan, later chairman and then dean of the college; Edmund L. King, another Brombert; J. Lionel Gossman and Sylvia Molloy, the first woman in the University ever to be promoted \"from the ranks\" to tenure (in 1973). Together with their associates, they have formed a team of romance scholars whose distinction has been recognized the world over. Raymond S. Willis Root, Robert Kilburn (1877-1950), Chaucer scholar and fourth dean of the faculty, first came to Princeton in the spring of 1905. President Wilson had written him about the University's plan to institute the preceptorial system and had asked whether it would be conven\u00ad ient for Root to come down from New Haven for an interview. As he journeyed to Princeton on a bright day in April, Root later recalled, he had misgivings \"as to this new\u00ad fangled method of teaching and more personally as to whether a Yale man could be happy in Princeton.\" His interview lasted some forty minutes. Wilson asked Root no questions about himself but spoke \"with winning elo\u00ad quence\" about his plans for Princeton. \"Before five minutes had passed,\" Root remembered, \"I knew that I was in the presence of a very great man . . . that I never before talked face to face with so compelling a person. Before the talk was over my loyalties were entirely committed to him. Had Woodrow Wil\u00ad son asked me to go with him and work under him while he inaugurated a new university in Kamchatka or Senegambia I would have said 'yes' without further question.\" This loyalty and devotion, Root said, were shared by the other teacher- scholars who made up the original group of preceptors; they felt that \"they were embarked upon a great educa\u00ad tional adventure under the immediate 416 ROBERT KILBURN ROOT guidance of a great and wise in\u00ad novator.\" Root committed his loyalty and devo\u00ad tion to President Hibben after Wilson left to enter political life, and to Presi\u00ad dent Dodds after Hibben retired, and when Root's turn came (in his own phrase) \"to go on the retirement shelf\" some forty years after his first interview with Wilson, the trustees declared that his life and labor here had been \"in\u00ad formed by a union of critical judgment and unabashed partisanship in all things Princetonian.\" Root proved adept in the use of the \"new-fangled method of teaching,\" and eventually earned the distinction of having led the longest-lived precepto\u00ad rial group in Princeton's history. A group of men in the Classes of 1917, 1918, and 1919 who had enjoyed their preceptorials with him as under\u00ad graduates asked him to lead an alumni preceptorial group after graduation. Starting in the 1920s and continuing until his death in 1950 they met with him two or three times a year for dinner at one of the eating clubs, followed by a preceptorial discussion of some literary work. Root was also a popular lecturer. Whether the subject was Chaucer, Eighteenth Century Literature, or The Elements of the English Language (\"Root's Roots\" the students called it), his lectures were models of organiza\u00ad tion and lucidity. Every year in Root's Roots he analyzed the probable origin of the surname of each student in the course. His graduate seminars were infused with rigorous intellectual discipline, and many students who were trained by him were forever grateful, as one of them put it, \"because he first sharp\u00ad ened\" their \"instruments of precise thought.\" Root wrote many articles and books on Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Pope. His most important work was a defini\u00ad tive edition of Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde (1928). In the course of his study of this poem Root performed a notable piece of literary detective work. Scholars had long been puzzled over the date of the writing of Troilus, which they variously placed some time between 1373 and 1386. Root thought perhaps he had found a clue in the lines of the poem beginning \"The bent moone with hire homes pale, I Saturne and Jove, in Cancro joyned were.\" He wondered if the astronomical phenomenon thus described\u2014the con\u00ad junction of Saturn, Jupiter and the crescent Moon (her horns pale from the lingering twilight) in the sign of Cancer\u2014was possible; and he specu\u00ad lated that if it were, Chaucer might have used it because it occurred when he was writing the poem. Root con\u00ad sulted his colleague, Professor Henry Norris Russell, the astrophysicist, who said that the conjunction of the three heavenly bodies within a single seg\u00ad ment of the heavens was possible, but extremely infrequent. After compli\u00ad cated calculations Russell informed Root that the configuration described by Chaucer would have occurred in the month of May or early June of 1385, for the first time in six hundred years. Root then carried the study a step further. In the poem the unusual heavenly configuration was followed by a violent thunderstorm, which pre\u00ad vented Criseyde from leaving her un\u00ad cle's home after having supper with him and thus resulted in her first en\u00ad counter with Troilus. From his studies of medieval astrology Root knew that the conjunction of the two planets and the Moon in the sign of Cancer would be followed by a deluge and wondered ROPER LANE 417 if he could find evidence of such a storm. On consulting the chronicles of the medieval historian, Thomas WaI- singham, he discovered that a terrific thunderstorm had in fact flooded Eng\u00ad land in July 1385. From these findings Root and Russell concluded, in a joint paper in the Pub\u00ad lications of the Modern Language Asso\u00ad ciation of America (1924), that Troilus and Criseyde was not finished earlier than the spring or summer of 1385, thus establishing the fact that Troilus was a product of Chaucer's mature years, written shortly before he began the Canterbury Tales. Among his publications, Root took pride, according to his colleagues, \"in slyly including\" a volume on Machine Gun Sights for Aircraft Use, which he wrote while serving as a major of ordnance in World War I. Root became dean of the faculty when Harold W. Dodds assumed the presidency in 1933 and was able to help achieve economies which permitted the University to avoid salary cuts dur\u00ad ing the depression of the 1930s. In World War II Root showed a ca\u00ad pacity to deal with complexities as he guided the faculty and adjusted the curriculum to the sudden shifts and strains brought on by the war. At the end of the war, the trustees asked him to continue in office a year after he reached the age for retirement so that he might contribute his wisdom and experience to the initiation of the Uni\u00ad versity's program for returning serv\u00ad icemen. \"To all of his many activities,\" his faculty colleagues said, \"he brought un\u00ad failing qualities of integrity and self- sacrifice. . . . His opinions were sharp and clear; if at times they seemed im\u00ad personal or cold, their austerity stemmed from the high value he set upon institutions and order\u2014whether of the law, or of the University, or of the Church.\" Dean Root was an Episcopalian and a faithful communicant of Trinity Church. One November Sunday, Father Williams, who was then rector, thanked God, in his opening prayer, for Princeton's football victory over Yale the day before. At that point Dean Root got up and walked out. Undergraduates thought it was because he was a Yale graduate but older friends knew that in Bob Root's theology, not even a Yale football victory would be worthy of notice in a service of worship. In his seventy-fourth year, he went to St. Louis to deliver a public lecture at Washington University on \"The Fierce Indignation of Dean Swift.\" In the midst of an animated discussion about Alexander Pope while at lunch the day before his lecture, Dean Root suddenly died of a heart attack. Dean Root had never married. He bequeathed to the trustees his house at 25 Mercer Street and the rights to all his published books and writings, and directed that the income be used for the purchase of books in English litera\u00ad ture for the University Library. He also left the trustees some antique furniture he had used in the Dean's House and several pieces of presentation silver. One of them was a loving cup that had been presented to him by his alumni preceptorial group. Roper Lane, which extends between Cap and Gown Club and Cottage Club from Prospect Avenue to the main en\u00ad trance of Palmer Stadium, is named for William W. Roper '02, varsity football coach during the years 1906-1908, 1910-1911, and 1919-1930. This short passage way is a modest memorial, but on autumn Saturdays, when it is 418 ROPER LANE crowded with Princetonians inching their way to or from football games, it is a lively and appropriate one. Bill Roper was, in President Dodds's phrase, \"a vibrant personality.\" He was one of the last of the inspirational coaches; his staccato talks to the teams between halves and his oratorical peri\u00ad ods at rallies before big games were his\u00ad trionic masterpieces. Roper's style was eclectic, oppor\u00ad tunistic. He tended to borrow plays from teams that did well against Princeton. For example, in the fifth game of the 1919 season, West Virginia overwhelmed Princeton with its spread formation, 25 to 0. On the next two weekends, Princeton employed the same formation to good advantage, tying Harvard 10 to 10 and beating Yale 13 to 6. Roper applied his gift for improvisa\u00ad tion to language as well as to football. \"The trouble with you,\" he once told a recalcitrant star, \"is that you're too in- degoddamnpendent.\" Newspapermen called Roper an evangelist; his fiery talks at rallies be\u00ad fore the big games did indeed have a smell of brimstone about them. In 1920, before the Harvard game in Cambridge, Roper, looking in profile like General Sherman, strode up and down the front of the platform in Alex\u00ad ander Hall where the Princeton team was seated, and going down the list of players on both teams, position by posi\u00ad tion, declared in each case that the Princeton player was plainly superior to his opposite number at Harvard. He then announced that he had purchased one-way railroad tickets for the team and that if they didn't win, they would have to make their own arrangements for getting home. Harvard and Princeton played a 14-14 tie game, so hard-fought and so exciting that no one remembered to inquire whether any of the Princeton team had to walk home. Roper was not a methodical type, and sometimes his associates had to improvise for him. In that same fall of 1920 Roper forgot about a Yale game invitation he had extended to some of his colleagues on the Philadelphia city council until a few days before the game, when all the seats had been sold. The best that George R. (Joe) Murray 1893, graduate manager of athletics, could do was to put a bench between the wooden stands and the goal-posts at the open end of the Stadium and to give Roper hand-written notes, instructing the ushers to seat the visiting council- men there. As it turned out, these proved to be the best seats in the Stadium. The game's first score came in the second quarter, when Frank Murrey drop-kicked a 34-yard field goal that sailed over the heads of the Philadel\u00ad phia councilmen. Later Don Lourie, aided by Stan Kecks stalwart blocking, sprinted forty-seven yards across the goal-line and touched the ball down a few yards from their feet, and Keck placed-kicked the ball over their heads for the extra point. In the third quarter, Captain Mike Callahan recovered a Yale fumble on the Yale fifteen-yard line and crossed the goal line right in front of the coun\u00ad cilmen for a touchdown, and Keck sent the ball over their heads for the extra point. Later, with Lourie holding, Keck place-kicked a 36-yard field goal, and once again the ball went spinning over the heads of the councilmen. After the game, as the Princeton fans snake-danced around the field, tossing their hats over the goal-posts in cele\u00ad bration of Princeton's 20 to 0 victory, the Philadelphia councilmen hurried to the Princeton dressing rooms to thank ROWING 419 Roper for the marvelous arrangements he had made for them. For many years Roper was the prin\u00ad cipal speaker at the annual meeting to acquaint freshmen with the history and principles of the honor system in examinations. \"No one,\" Dean Gauss said, \"ever had a more withering scorn for the dishonest, the hypocritical, and the unsportsmanlike. No one ever had a higher faith in the human spirit and in its possibilities.\" In addition to Roper Lane, Roper is remembered by a trophy, established in 1939 by his widow and the Class of 1902, which is awarded annually to that senior who best combines high scholas\u00ad tic rank and sportsmanship with gen\u00ad eral proficiency in athletics. Rothschild Arch, The, connecting Dickinson Hall with the University Chapel, was given in 1930 by Simon F. Rothschild and his son, Walter N. Rothschild '13, in memory of Walter's mother and his brother, Howard F. Rothschild '21; inscribed at the top of the arch are these words: MATRI FILOQUE IN AMORE DEDICATUS. Rowing, begun as an undergraduate sport at Yale and Harvard in the 1840s, developed more slowly at Princeton, which was less well endowed by nature for aquatic sports. Lamenting the ab\u00ad sence of this strong deterrent to dissi\u00ad pation (\"boating and spreeing are, physically at least, incompatible\"), the senior editors of the Nassau Literary Magazine in their last issue in 1860 suggested the possibility of rowing on the Delaware and Raritan Canal; they thought the canal no less serviceable than the \"diminutive Cam\" of Cam\u00ad bridge University, whose rowers were then the champions of England, and urged \"the men of '61\" to pursue this matter the following year \"with class spirit and enterprise.\" The outbreak of the Civil War pre\u00ad vented the Class of 1861 from acting on this suggestion, and it was not until 1870 that half a dozen undergraduates began a \"navy\" at Princeton. \"Uniting their purses as well as their purposes,\" an undergraduate observer recorded, they bought from Yale two old six-oared gigs, which proved to be \"respectable imitations of Noah's Ark.\" One gig sank to the bottom of the canal the first time it was taken out, but the other proved buoyant, and in it the crew \"learned to feather an oar, sit in a boat fairly, and judiciously expend their strength on the stroke.\" Later, the Princeton Boating Club was organized, and gradually more equipment was secured: a six-oared shell, a four-oared shell, a barge for practice, and, in 1874, a boathouse on the canal. The same year Princeton and Wesleyan were admitted to member\u00ad ship in the Rowing Association of American Colleges, despite the objec\u00ad tion of Amherst \"that a line must be drawn somewhere.\" That summer Princeton entered freshman and varsity crews in the association's annual inter\u00ad collegiate regatta at Saratoga. In the first event, the Class of 1877 crew got off to a very bad start, but by deter\u00ad mined effort made up the lost distance and, with a magnificent spurt toward the end of the three-mile course, fin\u00ad ished ahead of the Yale and Brown freshmen, the only other entrants, thus giving Princeton a victory in its first in\u00ad tercollegiate race. Elated members of the Class of 1877 held a victory celebra\u00ad tion in the College gymnasium, where the crew's oars stood crossed and be- ribboned on the platform and their shell hung from the rafters. Each of the 420 ROWING six oarsmen was given a ten-inch silver loving cup, lined with gold. Princeton's first intercollegiate vic\u00ad tory proved to be its last in the nineteenth century. During the dozen years, 1872 to 1884, that the Boating Club survived, the varsity came in last in most of its races\u2014in six-oared boats at Saratoga, in four-oared shells on the Schuylkill River at Philadelphia in com\u00ad petition for the Childs Cup, begun in 1879. The chief reason for Princeton's lack of success was the inadequacy of the Delaware and Raritan Canal as a place for practice. In comparing the canal with the Cam, the 1860 Nassau Lit had overlooked one important dif\u00ad ference: the steady stream of commer\u00ad cial traffic on the canal. In those days the canal was crowded with boats, some propelled by steam, others drawn by mules on the towpath. Passing them on half-oar was difficult and dangerous, and an arduous job for the bow oar who served as coxswain, steering with his right foot as he rowed. Several alumni who rowed on the canal in the 1870s dreamed of securing a lake for Princeton rowing. One of them, Howard Russell Butler 1876, persuaded Andrew Carnegie to build such a lake, and Lake Carnegie (q.v.) was dedicated in 1906. For the first few years after the lake was completed, competitive rowing was limited to interclass races under the supervision of Constance J. Titus, a former United States single sculls champion. In 1909 a group of oarsmen, led by Norman Armour '09, then crew captain and later a career ambassador, asked J. Duncan Spaeth, Professor of English, who had been captain of the University of Pennsylvania crew in 1888, to help develop a varsity boat for intercol\u00ad legiate competition. Professor Spaeth agreed. \"I thought it was to be a temporary affair,\" Spaeth later recalled, \"but found myself in the position of a spec\u00ad tator at a fire who catches a baby thrown out of a window and can dis\u00ad cover no one who will claim it. 'It's yours,' the crowd says.\" Spaeth served as amateur rowing coach through 1925. Under his guid\u00ad ance Princeton committed itself to the idea of short races, ranging from the Henley distance of a mile and five- sixteenths to two miles, rowed exclu\u00ad sively on college water in contrast to the four-mile races at Poughkeepsie and New London. In 1911 Princeton celebrated its re\u00ad turn to intercollegiate rowing with a triangular regatta on Lake Carnegie in which it finished two lengths behind Cornell (the Poughkeepsie champions) and nine lengths ahead of Yale. This creditable performance helped stimu\u00ad late the Class of 1887 to give a boat- house the following year. The 1913 var\u00ad sity scored the University's first major victory by winning from Harvard and Penn on the Charles River. The 1916 varsity defeated Yale, Harvard, Co\u00ad lumbia, Navy, and Pennsylvania, losing only to Cornell by the length of the forward deck. HEINIE LEH'S CREW Spaeth's greatest crew was the 1921 eight, stroked by Phi Beta Kappa oars\u00ad man Heinie Leh. It emerged from obscurity\u2014most of its members had been junior varsity oarsmen the year before\u2014to defeat every crew it met: Navy, Harvard, Cornell, Yale, and California. It rowed its fastest race against California, that year's Pacific Coast champion, setting a record (8:53.8) for the Lake Carnegie up\u00ad stream course of 1% miles. But its most spectacular victory was in the triangular regatta with Navy and Harvard in ROWING 421 which Leh stroked the Princeton crew to a four-length victory over Harvard, and a half-length victory over Navy, the previous year's Olympic champions and afterwards winner of the regatta at Poughkeepsie. Some of the excitement of this event was conveyed in the Alumni Weekly's eyewitness account by Dr. Spaeth, who watched from the car of Trustee Henry B. Thompson 1877 as it followed the course of the race, moving along the towpath be\u00ad tween the lake and the canal. Harvard got off first, Navy second, Princeton last. But before the half-mile mark was reached, Princeton had pulled ahead and was still leading by ten feet as the crews passed the mile flag. But about 200 yards beyond the mile mark [Spaeth recounted], Leh lost his oar-handle just as he was get\u00ad ting ready to answer Navy's last des\u00ad perate challenge for the lead. For two . . . [beats] the Princeton crew was without a stroke, and the Navy shell in a flash shot into a lead of half a length. Brigham at 7 heroically stroked the crew until Leh recovered his oar, and then . . . the plucky Princeton stroke dug in again at a raised beat. In a long, hard mile and a quarter by desperate meeting of every Navy spurt he had managed to pull out a lead often feet. And now in less than five seconds Navy had gained half a length. But instead of discouraging Leh, it seemed to rouse him and his crew. Before the mile- and-a-half mark was reached the lost half-length was regained, and the blue flag of the Navy and the white flag of Princeton dropped simul\u00ad taneously. Into the last stretch the two lead\u00ad ers shot, prow and prow alternating by inches. \"Will they last?\" called out Mr. Thompson. \"They'll last,\" I said, \"but I wish they had stored up for the last twenty strokes the power that went into regaining the lost lead a minute ago.\" Twenty more strokes to go and still even! Then the emergency signal came and was answered; up went the stroke for the final dash and on the second stroke of that final spurt I whispered to Mr. Thompson, \"We've got 'em!\" Stroke by stroke we went ahead; the time interval at the finish between Princeton and Navy was 24/s seconds. Four seconds make a length on Lake Carnegie. And that decisive lead was gained in the last twenty strokes! Charles P. Logg, former University of Washington oarsman, was varsity coach from 1925 to 1931. His 1927 crew, five of whom were sophomores, was the first Princeton crew to win both the Childs Cup (from Penn and Co\u00ad lumbia) and the Carnegie Cup (from Cornell and Yale), which was given by Andrew Carnegie's widow in 1920. LIGHTWEIGHT ROWING Meantime Gordon G. Sikes '16, a member of the University administra\u00ad tion who had been coxswain of Spaeth's 1916 varsity crew, introduced 150- pound rowing at Princeton in 1920, serving, like his mentor, as an amateur coach. Two of his crews, the 1926 eight and the 1930 eight won the Joseph Wright Challenge Cup (named for the Pennsylvania coach who initiated light\u00ad weight rowing in the United States) in the annual regatta of the American Rowing Association, thus earning the lightweight championship of the East. The 1930 crew competed for the Thames Challenge Cup in the English Henley, winning two races before it was eliminated. In 1931, when Sikes succeeded Logg 422 ROWING as varsity heavyweight coach, chaplain, WiI- hemus B. Bryan '20, began his eight years as amateur coach of the fifties. Both his 1933 and 1935 crews won the Goldthwait Cup from Harvard and Yale, and the Joseph Wright Cup in the American Henley on the Schuylkill. The 1933 crew made an unsuccessful bid for the Thames Challenge Cup in the English Henley. Delos C. (\"Dutch\") Shoch, former University of Washington oarsman, coached the lightweight crew in 1939 and 1940, James A. Rathschmidt in 1941 and 1942. After losing to Pennsyl\u00ad vania and Harvard early in the season, the 1942 eight outrowed them and all the other competitors for the Wright Cup over the Henley distance on Lake Carnegie, lowering the course light\u00ad weight record by almost six seconds. After the Second World War, Gor\u00ad don Sikes returned to his first love, coaching the fifties in 1946 and 1947. Later, some of the oarsmen who had rowed under him in the 1920s, in trib\u00ad ute to his \"courage, enthusiasm, and devotion to Princeton,\" founded the Gordon Sikes Medal, awarded annually to the outstanding senior lightweight oarsman. The decade 1948 through 1957 was a golden age for lightweight rowing at Princeton. The 1948 crew, coached by Davis Spencer '45, won the Joseph Wright Cup in the American Henley and the Thames Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta\u2014the first Princeton crew to win in this ancient British tournament. The 1949 eight, coached by Charles von Wrangell, won the Goldthwait Cup from Harvard and Yale and, although twice defeated in other races in this country, performed superbly in the British Henley Regatta, twice equaling the record for the course, to retain the Thames Challenge Cup for Princeton. In five successive years from 1953 through 1957, Princeton won the Goldthwait Cup from Harvard and Yale and in 1953, 1956, and 1957, also won the Joseph Wright Cup for the eastern sprint championship. The 1953 crew, coached by Arthur Sueltz, pared three-tenths of a second off the record for the Wright Cup race, and lost the final for the Thames Challenge Cup after breaking the English Henley course record by six seconds in one of its preliminary races. Coach Donald Rose's undefeated 1956 eight, which twice broke the Lake Carnegie course record for the Henley distance, and his undefeated 1957 eight, which lowered a sixteen-year-old Charles River course record by nearly nine seconds, became the third and fourth Princeton winners of the Thames Challenge Cup. OUTSTANDING HEAVYWEIGHT CREWS Gordon Sikes's 1933 and 1934 varsity heavyweight crews, both stroked by Aikman Armstrong '34 (another Phi Beta Kappa oarsman), Har\u00ad vard and M.I.T. for the newly insti\u00ad tuted Karl Taylor Compton Cup, pre\u00ad sented by the former Princeton physi\u00ad cist who had become president of M.I.T., and they also outrowed Navy, Columbia, Pennsylvania, and Cornell \u2014losing both seasons only to Yale, un\u00ad official Eastern sprint champion. The 1934 eight competed for the Grand Challenge Cup in the Royal Henley Regatta in England and, in its second round, forced Leander, premier rowing club of England, to set a new course re\u00ad cord to win. Fred Spuhn succeeded Sikes as var\u00ad sity heavyweight coach, serving from RUGBY 423 1938 to 1942. His 1939 and 1941 crews won the historic Childs Cup, and aU though the 1942 crew lost it to Penn by four feet, they went on to score an upset victory over Yale and Cornell for the Carnegie Cup. Dutch Schoch was heavyweight coach from 1946 to 1965. After achiev\u00ad ing only moderate success in the regu\u00ad lar season, his 1948 crew rowed its way into the finals of the Olympic tryouts and placed second to California. Win\u00ad ners of both the Carnegie and the Childs Cups, the 1949 eight set a new record for the Lake Carnegie downstream course of 1\u00be miles. The 1952 crew finished second to Navy in both the Intercollegiates and the Olym\u00ad pic trials. The 1956 crew not only won the Childs Cup, but took the Compton Cup with the best time recorded since it was first placed in competition in 1933. Peter W. Sparhawk, stroke of Cor\u00ad nell crews in the early 1950s, became Varsity heavyweight coach in 1966. His 1968 crew was the first since 1952 to win the Carnegie Cup from Yale and Cornell, setting an example for the 1969 and 1970 crews, who made it three in a row. THE SEVENTIES The seventies brought new vitality to Princeton's century-old rowing tradi\u00ad tion. Thanks to gifts from some 300 crew alumni and other friends, a long- awaited year-round training facility be\u00ad came available in 1972 with the dedica\u00ad tion of an enclosed rowing tank, built next to the boathouse. A year later, the men's lightweight crew, coached by Gary Kilpatrick, capped an undefeated Season by winning the Thames Chal\u00ad lenge Cup; at Syracuse the previous summer, five of its members had won the national championship for freshmen four-oared crew with coxswain. In 1976, the men's heavyweight crew, coached by Peter Sparhawk, edged out Wisconsin for second place in the In\u00ad tercollegiate Rowing Association's an\u00ad nual regatta for the national champion\u00ad ship, won by California. These years also brought exciting achievements, both here and abroad, by the newest arrivals at the Class of 1887 Boathouse. In 1972, the first women's crew ever to represent Princeton won the Eastern Intercol\u00ad legiate Regatta, shaving nine seconds off the national women's record, and their captain, Amy Richlin '73, became one of the first women to wear the white sweater with black \"P,\" tradi\u00ad tionally awarded captains of cham\u00ad pionship teams. Undefeated in dual meets, the 1973 women's varsity placed third in the national women's rowing championships. In 1974, Carol Brown '75 and Janet Youngholm '75 won the national col\u00ad legiate title for women's pairs without coxswain, and at the world cham\u00ad pionships in Lucerne, Switzerland, fin\u00ad ished a length ahead of a strong Soviet pair on their way to the finals, where they ranked as fifth best in the world. Carol Brown also won a silver medal at Nottingham, England, in 1975 and a bronze medal at the Montreal Olym\u00ad pics a year later. Rugby at Princeton began with the founding of the Princeton Rugby Club in the spring of 1931 by a pair of British graduate students, H. Cooper and Monti Barak. Coaching was provided by Professor John Whitton, who ac\u00ad tively supported the club throughout 424 BENJAMIN RUSH its first forty-five years. The initial sea\u00ad son was highly successful, as both Har\u00ad vard and Yale were defeated twice. In 1934 the team, captained by Ed Lee '34, lost only to a touring Cambridge University side. Suspended during World War II, rugby was propitiously revived in the spring of 1948, when the club won the Bermuda Cup, and the Missouri Cup, and was featured in an article in Life magazine. In the fall of 1959 and the spring of 1960, the club put together successive undefeated seasons. The team of 1962, led by Bill Swain, won the first Commonwealth Cup tourna\u00ad ment. In 1969, captain Terry Lar- rimer's team won the first Ivy League Rugby tournament, the Easterns Championship, and the prestigious Washington 7's tournament. In 1970, the Princeton Rugby Alumni Association was formed to sup\u00ad port the undergraduate teams and to play an occasional \"Old Boys\" match. This created a new tradition at Re\u00ad unions when the alumni take on the students for the Doc Whitton Cup\u2014a match remarkable for the quality of rugby played and for the fierce yet friendly rivalry that exists between stu\u00ad dents and alumni. Thomas Pirelli Rush, Benjamin 1760 (1746-1813) was a physician, teacher, and man of affairs who played a dramatic role in the early history of his country, his college, and his profession. A man of contradictions, he practiced and taught the backward medical art of bloodletting, yet was far ahead of his time in the care of the mentally ill. He was a vigorous foe of slavery and capital punishment, an advocate of better education for women and of free public schools. More than any other person he was responsible for bringing John Witherspoon to Ameri\u00ad ca as Princeton's sixth president. He lost his father when he was six, and was brought up by his mother who kept a grocery shop in Philadelphia to help support and educate her seven children. When he was eight, he en\u00ad tered an academy conducted by his un\u00ad cle, Samuel Finley (later president of Princeton) at Nottingham, Maryland, where he made such progress that on entering Princeton five years later he was admitted to the junior class; he graduated in 1760 when he was not quite fifteen. Although of a pious nature, he did not think he would make a good minis\u00ad ter. President Davies was inclined to think he should take up the law, but his uncle, Dr. Finley, persuaded him to study medicine with Dr. John Red\u00ad mond in Philadelphia. He served an apprenticeship with Dr. Redmond for almost six years and attended the first lectures of Dr. John Morgan and Dr. William Shippen, Jr. 1754 in the newly formed medical department of the Col\u00ad lege of Philadelphia (later the Univer\u00ad sity of Pennsylvania). In the summer of 1766, when he was twenty, he sat up every night for sev\u00ad eral weeks with Dr. Finley, then presi\u00ad dent of the College, during his last ill\u00ad ness, and \"finally performed the dis\u00ad tressing office of closing his eyes.\" That fall he went to Edinburgh, Scotland, then the medical center of the world, where after two years of study, and some heroic experiments with emetics on his own person for his doctoral thesis on the digestion of food in the stomach, received his M.D. degree. While in Scotland he rendered his alma mater an incalculable service, when in cooperation with Richard BENJAMIN RUSH 425 Stockton, a trustee, he persuaded John Witherspoon to come to America as Princeton's president. Stockton's au\u00ad thority and dignity were indispensable to the mission, but it was Rush's confi\u00ad dent, audacious, and engaging youth that won the day. From Edinburgh, twenty-one-year-old Rush wrote forty- four-year-old Witherspoon \"your tal\u00ad ents have been in some measure buried, but at Princeton they will be called into action, and the evening of your life will be much more effulgent than your brightest meridian days have been.\" When Witherspoon felt obliged to decline because of his wife's fear of leaving home\u2014the very mention of going to America made her physically ill\u2014Rush asked Witherspoon \"And must poor Nassau Hall be ruined?\" and \"Will you then suffer your sun to set so soon?\" A little later he urged Wither\u00ad spoon to reconsider the Princeton invi\u00ad tation and offered to help him make another appeal to his wife. Soon, on Witherspoon's invitation, Rush spent several days with the Witherspoons at their home in Paisley. Shortly after\u00ad ward a friend of Witherspoon wrote to Richard Stockton in Princeton that \"to Mr. Witherspoon's great satisfaction, his wife has at last given a calm hearing to Mr. Rush, argued the Matter with him, and received a satisfying Answer to all her objections; so that now she is willing if the Doctor is rechosen . . . to go with him without Grudge.\" With\u00ad erspoon was re-elected in due course and he and Mrs. Witherspoon came to America in August 1768. Rush spent the following year in London, where he attended medical lectures, and in Paris. In London he was on friendly terms with Benjamin Franklin, and at Benjamin West's dined with Sir Joshua Reynolds, who in turn had him to dinner with Samuel Johnson and Oliver Goldsmith. In Paris he met Diderot, who gave him a letter of introduction to David Hume. Soon after his return home Rush was appointed to a chair of chemistry in the College of Philadelphia's medical de\u00ad partment, thus becoming at the age of twenty-three the first professor of chemistry in America. He built up a large private practice, at first among the poor, but he found time to further other interests. He published a pam\u00ad phlet on the iniquity of the slave trade, and helped organize the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery and the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage, the first antislavery society in America; he later became its president. In the growing quarrel between the colonies and the mother country, he associated with such leaders as Thomas Paine, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson. It was on his urging that Thomas Paine wrote a strong tract on behalf of complete American independence to which he gave the title, suggested by Rush, Common Sense. In the summer of 1775 while visiting President Witherspoon and Richard Stockton in Princeton, he met Stockton's sixteen-year-old daughter, Julia. The following January, a few days after his thirtieth birthday, he and Julia were married by the Reverend Presi\u00ad dent Witherspoon. Less than seven months later, the bridegroom, who had been elected a delegate to the Conti\u00ad nental Congress from Pennsylvania, joined his father-in-law and Dr. With\u00ad erspoon, both delegates from New Jer\u00ad sey, in signing the Declaration of Inde\u00ad pendence. While Surgeon-General of the Mid\u00ad dle Department of the Army during the Revolution, Rush became outraged by the conditions he found in army hospi-426 HENRY NORRIS RUSSELL tals and, failing to get the remedial ac\u00ad tion he sought from the director gen\u00ad eral, Dr. Shippen (his former teacher), he sent a protest to General Washing\u00ad ton, accusing Dr. Shippen of maladmin\u00ad istration. Washington referred the pro\u00ad test to Congress, which ruled in favor of Shippen, and Rush resigned his com\u00ad mission. Rush lost confidence in Wash\u00ad ington's ability and became associated indirectly with the Conway cabal to re\u00ad place him; later he deeply regretted this action, and supported Washington politically. Returning to Philadelphia, Rush re\u00ad sumed his practice, his teaching, and his humanitarian endeavors. At the medical school of the College of Philadelphia, he added courses on the theory and practice of medicine to his lectures in chemistry, and became the most admired teacher of medicine in Philadelphia, then the medical center of America. All told, he taught more than three thousand medical students, who carried his influence to every corner of the growing nation. Rush founded the Philadelphia Dis\u00ad pensary for the relief of the poor, the first of its kind in the United States, and for many years gave it hours of service without pay. He also founded Dickin\u00ad son College, was one of the charter trustees of Franklin College (later Franklin and Marshall), and\u2014being persuaded of the importance of remov\u00ad ing \"the present disparity which sub\u00ad sists between the sexes in the degrees of their education and knowledge\"\u2014 became an ardent incorporator of the Young Ladies Academy in Philadel\u00ad phia. He worked heroically during the yel\u00ad low fever epidemic of 1793; although he was severely censured for his stub\u00ad born reliance on bloodletting, his ac\u00ad count of the epidemic published the fol\u00adlowing year won him recognition by several European learned societies. His greatest contributions to medical science were the reforms he instituted in the care of the mentally ill during his thirty years of service as a senior physi\u00ad cian at the Pennsylvania Hospital. In the words of one of his biographers, Dr. Carl Binger, a psychiatrist, \"he took on heroic stature,\" substituting kindness and compassion for cruelty, and replac\u00ad ing routine reliance on archaic proce\u00ad dures by careful clinical observation and study. The year before he died, he published Medical Inquiries and Ob\u00ad servations upon the Diseases of the Mind, the first textbook on psychiatry in America, which Dr. Binger called \"the crowning achievement of his pro\u00ad fessional life.\" Benjamin and Julia Rush had thir\u00ad teen children; one of them, Richard Rush 1797, served as cabinet officer or ambassador under four presidents. In 1837 some of Rush's former stu\u00ad dents founded a medical college in Chicago; which they named for him. The American Psychiatric Association, whose official seal bears Rush's portrait, placed a bronze plaque at his grave in Philadelphia in 1965, designating him the \"Father of American Psychiatry.\" Russell, Henry Norris (1877-1957), for many years the leading theoretical as\u00ad tronomer in America, was graduated from Princeton in 1897 at the age of nineteen insigni cum laude (with ex\u00ad traordinary honor)\u2014a designation by the Faculty never used before or since. His father was a Presbyterian minister; his mother and maternal grandmother had both won prizes in mathematics. He recalled his parents' showing him the transit of Venus in 1882 when he was five years old. His favorite study in college was mathematics (his favorite HENRY NORRIS RUSSELL 427 sport, mountain-climbing); an interest in astronomy was stimulated by Profes\u00ad sor Charles A. Young (q.v.), with whom he continued to study after graduation, earning his Ph.D. summa cum laude in 1900. Following study as an advanced research student at Cambridge Univer\u00ad sity, England, he was appointed in\u00ad structor in astronomy by Woodrow Wilson in 1905; became a full professor in 1911, and director of the Observa\u00ad tory in 1912. He took an active part in the affairs of the Class of 1897 and at\u00ad tended reunions frequently. His class\u00ad mates were very proud of him; at their thirtieth reunion in 1927, they honored him and their old astronomy teacher by endowing the Charles A. Young Re\u00ad search Professorship of Astronomy with Russell as the first incumbent. Russell pioneered in the use of atomic physics for the analysis of the stars and thus played a principal part in laying the foundations of present-day astrophysics. He analyzed the physical conditions and chemical compositions of stellar atmospheres and evaluated the relative abundance of the elements. His assertion of the overwhelming abundance of hydrogen, was accepted, after prolonged controversy, as one of the basic facts of cosmology. His name is perpetuated by the Hertzsprung-Russell color magnitude diagram (stellar evolution), the \"Russell mixture\" (composition of solar and stel\u00ad lar atmospheres), Russell-Saunders coupling (spectrum analysis), and the Henry Norris Russell Lectureship of the American Astronomical Society, endowed at his retirement by gifts from fellow astronomers and Princeton classmates. Russell's position as America's lead\u00ad ing astronomer was recognized by his presidency of the American Astronomi\u00ad cal Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Philosophical Society. He was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society of England, two medals of the French Academy, five other medals of American scientific societies, and numerous honorary de\u00ad grees. Mexico conferred on him its Order of the Aztec Eagle, and issued a postage stamp in his honor\u2014done in orange and black. Russell attracted to Princeton an out\u00ad standing group of graduate students who went on to occupy positions of leadership in observatories throughout the country. Notable among his stu\u00ad dents were Harlow Shapley, Ph.D. 1913, who became director of the 1921; Donald H. Menzel, Ph.D. 1924, succeeded Shapley at Harvard in Lyman Spitzer, Jr., Ph.D. 1938, who suc\u00ad ceeded Russell as director of the Princeton Observatory in 1947. Harlow Shapley said that it was gen\u00ad erally agreed that the word \"genius\" more rightly applied to Russell than to any other American astronomer of his or earlier times. FJ.M. Stratton, lead\u00ad ing British astrophysicist, thought Rus\u00ad sell \"the most eminent and versatile theoretical astrophysicist in the United States if not in the world,\" and de\u00ad scribed him as \"a man of overflowing energy, never sparing himself in his own work or in assisting in the re\u00ad searches of others.\" Among Russell's 241 published pa\u00ad pers were articles written jointly with Princeton colleagues in both astronomy and physics and a joint paper with Robert K. Root, Professor of English, on \"A Planetary Date for Chaucer's Troilus\"; they also included a paper \"On the Navigation of Airplanes,\" for which Russell made observations in airplanes flying at 105 miles per hour, 428 SAILING at heights up to 16,000 feet, as a con\u00ad sultant to the federal government in World War I. Lyman Spitzer, Jr. has given us this vivid picture of Russell: Those who knew him in his later years remember him for his un\u00ad bounded energy and his enthusiasm for ideas. It is characteristic of the man that he would frequently be so carried away in his graduate lectures that he would talk enthusiastically for an additional hour or two, carrying his fascinated audience into exciting new realms of research. He brought this same keenness and enthusiasm to all the many experiences in his full and active life\u2014to his extensive travels, his wide reading of both prose and poetry, and his happy hours with his grandchildren. He would keep small children engrossed for hours with the paper boats, balls, birds, and animals that he con\u00ad structed with facility, his long, dex\u00ad trous fingers folding and creasing the paper with unerring speed. His knowledge was encyclopedic; it in\u00ad cluded facts and theories not only in all branches of science but also in such varied subjects as the Bible and the wild flowers of New Jersey. Russell spoke frequently on the so- called \"conflict\" between science and religion, seeking to assure those who feared science as \"a dangerous foe\" to religion that their feeling was \"al\u00ad together ill-advised.\" In his 1925 Terry Lectures at Yale, he fully accepted the mechanistic theory of nature, \"not as a demonstrated natural law, but as a working hypothesis\" and held that this hypothesis \"far from being hostile to religion . . . is capable of rendering religion important services.\" He con\u00ad cluded his Terry Lectures with this statement of his personal belief: The need for some venture of faith still remains; one must stake one's life upon something. For myself, if I am to stake all I have and hope to be upon anything, I will venture it upon the abounding fullness of God\u2014upon the assurance that, as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are His ways higher than our ways, and His thoughts than our thoughts. Just what future the Designer of the uni\u00ad verse has provided for the souls of men I do not know, I cannot prove. But I find that the whole order of Na\u00ad ture confirms my confidence that, if it is not like our noblest hopes and dreams, it will transcend them. . . . And, when immortality becomes for us no longer a matter of academic discussion, but the most vital of all questions; . . . we shall find our com\u00ad fort where so many before us have found it, in the ancient words, \"In manus tuas, Domine.\" Sailing. The Princeton University Yacht Club, which maintains facilities for sailing and racing on Lake Car\u00ad negie, was founded in 1928. In that same year, a \"Big-Three Regatta\" in eight-meter yachts initiated intercol\u00ad legiate racing and also provided an auspicious beginning for the Princeton Sailing Team, which was skippered to victory by Arthur Knapp, Jr. '28. Intercollegiate competition was firmly established in 1930 with the McMillan Cup (donated by William McMillan '28), which endures as the premier regatta. Princeton has won this event seven times, more than any other competitor. With the passage of time, the yachts have become boats and the regattas more numerous. Princeton has con\u00ad tinued to field successful teams, win\u00ad ning the National Intercollegiate Dinghy Championship three times. THE SALUTATORY ORATION 429 With the advent of coeducation, the sailing team expanded its membership to include women. The women's team has been notably successful, winning the National Women's Intercollegiate Championship three out of the first four years of its existence. In 1976, the facilities of the Yacht Club were enhanced by construction of the Lockwood Pirie '27 Boathouse on Lake Carnegie, made possible by the generosity of alumni and other Friends of Princeton Sailing. H. C. Curtiss, Jr. Salutatory Oration, The, which dates back to the first commencement in 1748, is Princeton's oldest student honor. Contrary to the usual practice elsewhere, the salutatory, rather than the valedictory (q.v.), which came later, was traditionally delivered by the highest ranking member of the senior class. In recent years, the faculty has chosen both speakers for their special qualifications for the parts as well as for their high scholastic standing. The first salutatorian, Daniel Thane, delivered his address \"in a modest and decent manner,\" according to an ac\u00ad count of commencement in Parkers Gazette and Post Boy of New York. He apologized \"for his Insufficiency\" (cus\u00ad tomary in those days), enumerated \"the Numberless Benefits the liberal Arts and Sciences yield to Mankind in pri\u00ad vate and social life,\" Excel\u00ad lency [the governor] and the Trustees, the President and whole Assembly.\" All of this was \"performed in good Latin from his Memory in a handsome orator\u00ad ical Manner in the Space of about half an Hour.\" Thane later employed his oratorical talents as a preacher. Two salutatorians became Princeton presidents: Samuel Stanhope Smith 1769 and Robert F. Goheen '40. Others have become eminent professors in the University: Allan Marquand 1874 (art and archaeology), Samuel R. Winans 1874 (classics), William Berryman Scott 1877 (paleontology), Henry Burchard Fine 1880 (mathematics), Henry Norris Russell 1897 (astrophysics), Edward T. Cone '39 (music). When Marquand and Winans tied for first place in 1874, Marquand gave a salutatory in Latin, Winans in Greek. Two brothers, David B. Jones and Thomas D. Jones, later trustees, tied for first place in 1876 and gave Latin and English salutatories, respectively. Two other brothers were salutatorians in the thirties: Lewis H. Van Dusen, Jr. '32, later a lawyer in Philadelphia, and Francis L. Van Dusen '34, who became a circuit court judge in the same city. The memorized half-hour oration, as delivered by the first salutatorian, eventually gave way to a ten-minute address, usually read from manuscript, and its tone, once in keeping with the formal proceedings of commencement, came to provide a kind of comic relief from them. In modern salutatories the humor of the text itself is heightened by the reaction of the other degree candi\u00ad dates, most of whom know no Latin but have at their places printed copies of the salutatory, with footnotes indicating the responses the salutatorian expects of them (hie plaudite, hie vociferate, hie dephrate, etc.); and they always do respond, though sometimes hesitat\u00ad ingly at first, with exuberance\u2014to the delight and surprise of the audience. In 1938 Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky, later professor of physics at Stanford University, carried this joke one step further by quoting in English a \"memorable saying\" of a \"foreign\" poet (Shakespeare), \"a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear,\" and then for the benefit of his \"Roman\" classmates, 430 DANIEL CLEMENS SAYRE translating it into Latin, \"Dormit sermo astutus in aure insipientis.\" In 1971, following a year in which no salutatory was given, Donald J. Mathi- son, a classics major, revived the tradi\u00ad tion with verve and wit, calling this restoration a \"classical renaissance\" and likening it to the one in Europe that \"prevailed over the ignorance and bar\u00ad barity of the Dark Ages.\" With tongue in cheek, he departed from the conven\u00ad tional expressions of gratitude, assuring the trustees, \"We are willing to listen to your advice on how to run our uni\u00ad versity,\" and lamenting to the faculty, \"I can not say, as is customary, that you have in large part made our minds and souls what they are not because this is more than true, but because it is perhaps less than complimentary.\" A wise salutatorian knows that his address will get more attention if it con\u00ad tains here and there a well-known Latin phrase which will be recognized by non-Latinists. Mathison played this principle to the hilt by piling one Latin aphorism on another in mock words of advice to his classmates, e.g., \"ut aliquando sit in vino hoc ergo Having talked at some length, he sud\u00ad denly stopped, looked at his watch, sadly announced \"Heu, eheu! Tempus fugit,\" quickly came to his classmates stood and cheered his bravura performance. The first woman salutatorian, Lisa Siegman '75, introduced a variation on the usual footnotes, calling for shouts from the boys (\"Pueri, hie vociferate\") when she observed that for 229 years the greeting of commencement audi\u00ad ences in Latin had been the duty of a male student (\"discipuli\") and for shouts from the girls (\"Puellae, hie voc\u00adiferate\") when she added with spirit that at last it was the duty of a female student (\"discipuL\u00b7e\"). Sayre, Daniel Clemens (1903-1956), first chairman of the Department of Aeronautical Engineering and first di\u00ad rector of the James Forrestal Research Center, was born in Columbus, Ohio, the same year that two other Ohioans, Orville and Wilbur Wright, made the first controlled and sustained flights in a power-driven airplane. Sixteen years later Sayre began the study of civil en\u00ad gineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology but, after taking a year off to work on dams in Ohio and Alabama to earn money for his expenses, changed his course to aeronautical en\u00ad gineering, earning his B.S. in 1924 and his M.S. in 1929. While still a student he earned his pilot's license and then organized the Boston Airport Corporation, which played a leading part in establishing this country's first commercial airline run, between New York and Boston. He served as instructor and assistant professor at M.LT. from 1927 to 1933. During the last two years, he con\u00ad ducted an extensive investigation of American air masses. The data he and his associates gathered during almost daily flights, at altitudes from 16,000 to 18,000 feet in an instrument-laden plane, proved of great value in the de\u00ad velopment of commercial and military aviation. They frequently encountered difficult atmospheric conditions. On one flight visibility was so poor that, coming down through a cloud layer for a landing, Sayre found he had drifted some 150 miles out to sea. With a rapidly dwindling fuel supply, he barely managed to get back, landing on a golf course near the coast. The news\u00ad papers played up the mishap, and, as SCHOLARSHIPS 431 Sayre liked to recall, more than one New England editor was unable to re\u00ad sist headlining the story: \"Professor Lost in Fog.\" Sayre was later on the editorial staff of the magazine Aviation, then, avia\u00ad tion editor of Newsweek, director of Statistics and Information for the Civil Aeronautics Authority, chief of the Safety Division of the Civil Aeronau\u00ad tics Board. In 1941 he was called to Princeton to organize an aeronautical engineering department to help meet the nation's critical needs in this field. He recruited some of the ablest aeronautical scientists in the country and secured the necessary support for their work from outside sources as well as from the University. As a result, the department rose in a very few years to a position of national leadership, evi\u00ad denced in 1949 when the Guggenheim Foundation selected Princeton and the California Institute of Technology as the places for the two Guggenheim Jet Propulsion Centers. In 1951, when the University was given the opportunity to acquire new laboratory facilities for the natural and engineering sciences from the Rocke\u00ad feller Institute for Medical Research, Sayre played a leading role\u2014\"indeed,\" President Goheen later said, \"he was the catalyst for the efforts of all others\"\u2014in the establishment of the James Forrestal Research Center, later renamed the Forrestal Campus. A man of wide interests, Sayre also contrib\u00ad uted his judgment and enthusiasm to the development of the Firestone Li\u00ad brary and the Council of the Humani\u00ad ties. He died at the age of fifty-three after a five-year struggle with cancer, \"gratefully remembered,\" President Dodds said, \"for his many constructive contributions to the growth of the mod\u00ad ern Princeton and by his colleagues for his cheerfulness, his contagious wit, and his very great courage throughout his long illness.\" A short time after his death, one of the original buildings of the Forrestal Campus was named Sayre Hall in his memory. Scholarships. James Leslie, Class of 1759, attended Princeton with the help of a gift of thirteen British pounds from a \"Fund for Pious Youth.\" After gradua\u00ad tion, he became a school teacher in New York City. When he died, he left his frugally guarded savings to the College as a perpetual fund \"for the education of poor and pious youth.\" In grateful recognition, President John Witherspoon designated this fund \"The Leslie Fund\" and, over the years\u2014as part of the University's endowment\u2014it has helped hundreds of young Princetonians prepare them\u00ad selves for lives of usefulness and honor. From the beginning, Princeton has welcomed students from differing eco\u00ad nomic backgrounds, and by now it has seven hundred endowed scholarship funds to help meet their needs. These funds have come from many sources: from graduates and their families; from members of the faculty, various classes, alumni associations, and friends of the University. Their total \"book value\" is nearly $30 million; their \"market value\" more than twice as much. The number and the needs of stu\u00ad dents have also risen over the years. Today, about half of the undergraduate body qualifies for some kind of financial help. To provide this, there are some outside sources of funds\u2014from corpo\u00ad rations and foundations, state and fed\u00ad share\" (75%) sity. And when necessary, Princeton augments the income from scholarship 432 WILLIAM BERRYMAN SCOTT endowment with her own unrestricted funds. Scholarship assistance generally re\u00ad quires a complementary expenditure of time, energy, and future resources from the student recipients. Those who receive outright scholarship grants work a certain number of hours in cam\u00ad pus jobs: in the Library, Dining Halls, University Store, Laboratories and other places\u2014earning well over a mil\u00ad lion dollars annually. They also assume interest-bearing loans to repay after graduation. By good fortune, DEI SUB NUMINE VIGET, the University has so far been able to assist any student who can meet the requirements for admission. Frederic E. Fox Scott, William Berryman 1877 (1858- 1947), the eminent vertebrate paleon\u00ad tologist who was Blair Professor of Geology from 1886 to 1930, spent al\u00ad most all of his long, happy, productive, and rather secluded life in Princeton. He was born a few months before the Lincoln-Douglas debates and about two years before the publication of Dar\u00ad win's On the Origin of Species, the son of a Presbyterian minister (who died before William's fourth birthday) and the grandson of the theologian, Charles Hodge 1815, who was often called \"The Presbyterian Pope.\" Throughout his life Scott demon\u00ad strated an apparent but unintended aloofness and formalness that, he later realized, resulted in part from his lack as a child of comradeship outside of his close-knit family, which was strongly dedicated to God, hard work, educa\u00ad tional eminence, and an unwavering conviction of its own quality. A frail and sickly child, Scott became precociously devoted to books. He expected to fol\u00adlow the family tradition of life as a cleric, but instead became a noted and much-honored scientist. As a Princeton student, researcher, and teacher, he discovered and studied many fossil vertebrates, and thereby helped initiate and develop important theories that tested and expanded some of Darwin's ideas about organic evolu\u00ad tion. Scott's life interests in geology and in religion are reflected in a verse about him in the Faculty Song: Here's to Bill Geology Scott, He has a carboniferous knot, He tells us how the earth was made, And how the Lord his sidewalks laid. He was \"Professor Princeton\" to the many students who enjoyed his famous lectures in which he combined scien\u00ad tific discourse with salty tales of his graduate study abroad and his ex\u00ad peditions to the American West. At his retirement in 1930, after half a cen\u00ad tury of teaching, many alumni voiced regret that students would no longer learn science from his stories of \"The Johnstown Flood\" and \"Chief Red Cloud's Arrest.\" As a boy of nine, Scott read proof on Charles Hodge's book \"What is Dar\u00ad winism?\" and agreed with his grand\u00ad father's conclusion that \"Darwinism is Atheism\"; but he changed his mind during his early professional years when the ideological tussle between Darwin and Genesis was at its height, compelling commitment or com\u00ad promise. Scott chose compromise. President McCosh, whom Scott re\u00ad garded as one of the greatest of teachers, conferred with Scott in writ\u00ad ing The Religious Aspects of Evolution (1888), in which he declared that he was \"in favor of evolution properly lim\u00ad ited,\" because it is \"the method by which God works.\" THE PUBLISHING HOUSE OF SCRIBNER 433 For his descendants Scott wrote his memoirs, parts of which were pub\u00ad lished in Some Memories of a Palaeon\u00ad tologist (Princeton University Press, 1939). These charming accounts are a valuable source of information about his family and ancestors, his education, travels, friends, publications, Univer\u00ad sity politics, and philosophies. In his Memories Scott said that no ac\u00ad count of his life would be complete that omitted the tale of how he, Henry Fairfield Osborn, and Francis Speir (called \"the triumvirate\" by their awed classmates of 1877), after a swim in the canal on a hot June day in 1876, de\u00ad cided to make a fossil-collecting trip to the Far West. The expedition that re\u00ad sulted from this historic decision (en\u00ad couraged by Professor Guyot and fi\u00ad nanced by the trustees) marked the be\u00ad ginning of the scientific careers of Scott and Osborn and of the acquisition for Princeton of what has become one of the finest collections of vertebrate fos\u00ad sils. Later, Osborn was largely respon\u00ad sible for the development of paleontol\u00ad ogy at the American Museum of Natu\u00ad ral History in New York and the growth of its fossil collection into the largest in the world. The famous Princeton Patagonian Expeditions (1896-1899) were origi\u00ad nated and financed by Scott's as\u00ad sistants, John B. Hatcher, who devel\u00ad oped many new ways of collecting fos\u00ad sils in the field and, in the Princeton Museum of Natural History, devised new methods of exhibiting them. Scott spent most of his time on his own re\u00ad search and had little interest in devel\u00ad oping the Museum or in training graduate students. These tasks were as\u00ad sumed by William J. Sinclair, who joined the Princeton faculty in 1904, and later by Glenn L. Jepsen, who joined it in 1930. Sinclair instituted the William Berryman Scott Fund for re\u00ad search in vertebrate paleontology and secured contributions to it. A principal donor was Childs Frick '05. Sinclair willed his own estate to Princeton for the Sinclair Professorship of Vertebrate Paleontology as a means of continuing the tradition of research and teaching in that subject begun by Scott in the 1880s. A measure of Scott's influence on students of paleontology is found in more than a dozen species of fossil mammals in different genera named \"scotti\" in his honor. Later these evi\u00ad dences of respect by younger men gave him as much pleasure as his many medals and honorary degrees. Although Scott was proud of having Benjamin Franklin, Charles Hodge, and other personages in his ancestral line, he maintained that his favorite family tree was that of the fossil camels. From the study of such fossil phylogenies, he concluded that they are not satisfactorily accounted for by the Darwinian factor of natural selec\u00ad tion; and many scientists now agree. Scott's splendid long career exemplifies the dedicated life of a gifted teacher in a privileged University envi\u00ad ronment, the way a man and an organi\u00ad zation make reciprocal contributions to each other's welfare, and the ways they change. On Scott's eightieth birthday at a big party his colleagues had for him in Procter Hall, he made an observation about a fossil that was strongly contrary to a statement he had made on the pre\u00ad vious day. When reminded of this, he said, \"Yes, but that was yesterday.\" Glenn E. Jepson Scribner, The publishing house of, was founded in 1846 and ever since has been presided over by successive gen-434 THE SEAL OF PRINCETON UNIVERSITY erations of Princeton graduates: by the founder, Charles Scribner 1840 (1846- 1871); by three Charles Scribner 1875 (1879-1930), Arthur his Charles (1952- ). Longest leadership by far has been given by those\u2014all in a direct line\u2014whom El- lery Sedgewick, editor of the Atfontic Monthly, once designated \"Charles the First, Charles the Second, Charles the Third . . . Charles the Fourth.\" The Scribners descended from Scrivener, who was in Norwalk, Con\u00ad necticut, in 1680; the family changed its name to Scribner after 1742. Charles Scribner 1840 married a daughter of John Insley Blair, donor of Blair Hall. The Scribners have been consistently devoted Princeton workers and ben\u00ad efactors. Charles Scribner 1875 was a trustee of the University 1912-1930 and chairman of its library committee 1915-1930. Founder of Princeton Uni\u00ad versity Press, the donor of its first building, and its first president, he was also one of the organizers of the Alumni Weekly, first president of the Princetonian Publishing Company, and president of the Princeton Club of New York. He was awarded an honorary Litt.D. in 1925. On his death in 1930, he left Princeton University Press $50,000 toward its endowment fund; when his portrait by Wilford Seymour Conrow '01 was unveiled at the Press in 1935, Dean Christian Gauss said the richest legacy the Press had received was the spirit of Charles Scribner him\u00ad self. Charles Scribner 13 followed in his father's footsteps as president of Princeton University Press 1940-1948. He also carried on his father's interest in the University library\u2014he was a fre\u00ad quent donor of rare books and manu\u00ad scripts. In 1946, under his presidency, Charles Scribner's Sons, in celebration of its centenary and Princeton's bicentenary, gave the University $50,000 for a conference room in the Firestone Library in memory of his four predecessors. Charles Scribner '43, who was class salutatorian at his graduation, has car\u00ad ried on the family tradition of service to Princeton as president of Princeton University Press, as chairman of the advisory councils of the department of classics and the department of English, and, like his grandfather, as a trustee of the University and chairman of its li\u00ad brary committee. He was given an honorary degree in 1966. In 1967, under his presidency, the Scribner firm turned over to the University its archives of more than a quarter-million documents, including correspondence with Winston Churchill, William Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Ernest Hemingway. Seal of Princeton University, The, which is in the custody of the Secretary of the University, is in effect the corpo\u00ad rate signature of the trustees. It is em\u00ad bossed on diplomas and printed on other official documents authorized by them and affixed by the secretary to legal instruments requiring its use. The seal of the College of New Jer\u00ad sey, used for almost a century and a half, comprised the following details: In the upper part of a circle, an open Bible with Latin characters VET NOV TES- TAMENTUM signifying the Old and New Testaments. Over the Bible, the motto VITAM MORTUIS REDDO (J restore life to the dead.) Underneath, on the right, a table with books signify\u00ad ing scholarship. On the left, a diploma, THE SECRETARY OF THE UNIVERSITY 435 signifying the goal of the student. On the outside of the circle, SIGILLUM COLLEGII NEO-CAESARIENSIS IN AMERICA (seal of the College of New Jersey in America). Since 1896, when at the Sesquicen- tennial of its founding the College of New Jersey became Princeton Univer\u00ad sity, the corporate seal has been simpler\u2014as described in the trustees' minutes of February 13, 1896: \". . . a shield resting upon a circle. In the upper part of the shield an open Bible with Latin characters VET NOV TES- TAMENTUM signifying the Old and New Testaments. . . In the lower part a chevron, denoting the rafters of a build\u00ad ing. In the spaces between the sides of the shield and the circle the motto DEI SUB NUMINE VIGET [Under God's power she circle SIGILLUM UNIVER-SITATIS PRINCETONIENSIS [seal of Princeton University].\" The shield from the official seal, minus the circle and with the motto in a ribbon beneath the shield, serves as the University's insignia and may be em\u00ad ployed for decorative purposes by any organization or individual connected with the University where the use of Princeton's symbol is appropriate. The full seal is strictly reserved for the purpose described in the college's original charter namely as \"a Common Seal under which they [the trustees] may pass all Diplomas, or Certificates of Degrees, and all Other the Affairs & Business of and Concerning the said Corporation. ...\" Secretary of the University, The, as\u00ad sists the clerk of the Board of Trustees and in this capacity makes arrange\u00ad ments for meetings of the board and of its executive committee, and prepares the minutes; he is secretary of the committee on honorary degrees.

As secretary of the corporation known as \"The Trustees of Princeton University,\" he has custody of the University seal and affixes it to all documents that re- 436 SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES quire its use, including diplomas. In the words of the Charter he is \"the agent . . . upon whom process against the corporation may be served.\" He also has oversight of Commencement and other University convocations. The office of the secretary serves as an arm of the president's office, and at one time or another has been head\u00ad quarters for a variety of University ac\u00ad tivities including alumni affairs, student aid, public information, and de\u00ad partmental advisory councils. For many years the office housed archives of the University, and during his incumbency V. Lansing Collins wrote extensively about the history of the University and of the town of Princeton. Until 1974 the secretary was responsible for the prep\u00ad aration and distribution of the several catalogues and other publications is\u00ad sued under the heading, \"The Official Register,\" as well as The Weekly Bulle\u00ad tin. The By-Laws charge the secretary with \"responsibility, under the Presi\u00ad dent, for such other areas of the Uni\u00ad versity's affairs, not specifically as\u00ad signed to another officer, as the Board or the President may designate.\" One incumbent characterized the office as \"the department of everything else.\" Those who have endeavored with the help of their loyal associates to cope with these manifold obligations have been: Charles W. McAlpin 1888, S. '42, 1966-1974; Thomas H. Wright '62, 1974- Senate of the United States has num\u00ad bered among its members seventy-nine Princeton alumni from twenty-four states. Since its establishment in 1789 it has been without a Princetonian only twenty years.

Service of Remembrance, conducted annually by the Alumni Association, had its origins in a memorial service for Princeton war dead first held in Nassau Hall on Baccalaureate Sunday of 1919. The service was broadened in 1943 to include remembrance of all alumni who had died during the preceding year and was held thereafter in the University Chapel. In 1970 the time was changed to the mid-winter Alumni Day. The service is conducted by three or four alumni ministers and concludes with a procession of class representa\u00ad tives, bearing floral tributes in memory of their classmates who have died in the preceding year. Sesquicentennial Celebration, The, took place on October 20, 21, and 22 in 1896, reaching a climax when the Col\u00ad lege of New Jersey, on the 150th an\u00ad niversary of its founding, formally an\u00ad nounced its change of title to Princeton University. More than two years were spent in the celebration's preparation, and it was, according to contemporary accounts, the largest and best organ\u00ad ized academic festival ever held in America. The previous winter and spring, President Patton and classicist Andrew Fleming West, the organizing genius of the celebration, had toured the country, arousing alumni interest, while mathematician Henry B. Fine and art historian Allan Marquand had gone about Europe, inviting eminent scholars to attend. That summer a trustee-faculty committee had assured the Sesquicentennial's national signifi\u00ad cance by securing President Cleve\u00ad land's agreement to give the principal address. The entire affair was a brilliant success, thanks to careful planning\u2014 and to Princeton's good fortune in hav\u00ad ing for the occasion three days of beau\u00ad tifully crisp and sunny weather in an otherwise wet and foggy October. Visitors to the celebration found the town and campus bright with color\u2014 the red, white, and blue and the orange and black of flags, banners, and rib\u00ad bons, set off against, the brilliant fall colors of the trees and of autumn flow\u00ad ers coming into bloom. Princeton ban\u00ad ners hung from dormitory windows, American flags were raised on every flagpole, and in the streets carriage and draft horses wore orange ribbons in their manes. Triumphal arches set up on Nassau Street for the occasion\u2014one given by the town, the other provided by the College\u2014added a touch of clas\u00ad sical dignity to the scene. The town's arch bore a Latin inscription for \"God Save the Republic,\" and the College's bore mottoes bidding farewell to the old (AVE VALE COLLEGIVM NEOCAESARIENSE) and welcoming the new (AVE SALVE VNIVERSITAS PRINCETONIENSIS). During the week preceding the cele\u00ad bration, a fitting prelude to Princeton's assumption of university status was provided by a series of eighteen learned lectures given by six outstand\u00ad ing foreign scholars: Leipzig's Karl Brugmann \"The Descent of Primates\"; Gottingen's THE SESQUICENTENNIAL CELEBRATION 439 Felix Klein on \"The Mathematical The\u00ad ory of the Top\"; Edinburgh's Andrew Seth on \"Theism\"; and Cambridge's J. J. Thomson on \"The Discharge of Elec\u00ad tricity in Gases.\" The American Math\u00ad ematical Society held a special meeting in Princeton in honor of Professors Klein and Thomson, and less formal gatherings were held to honor the other lecturers. The first day of the celebration in\u00ad cluded a sermon by President Patton in the morning, a reception of delegates in the afternoon, and an orchestral con\u00ad cert that evening. At the convocation for the reception of delegates, Har\u00ad vard's president, Charles W. Eliot, speaking on behalf of American univer\u00ad sities, congratulated Princeton on the contributions it had made to public service, medicine, history, and science, through such men as John Wither- spoon, Oliver Ellsworth, James Madi\u00ad son, Benjamin Rush, David Ramsay, and Joseph Henry (qq.v.). The speaker for European universities, Professor J. J. Thomson of Cambridge, extolled the achievements of three Princeton scientists, physicist Joseph Henry, geologist Arnold Guyot, and as\u00ad tronomer Charles A. Young (qq.v.) The main events of the second day were a convocation in the morning, a football game in the afternoon, and a torchlight procession at night. At the convocation, Henry van Dyke 1873, representing the Cliosophic So\u00ad ciety, recited an ode, \"The Builders,\" which he had composed for the occa\u00ad sion, and Woodrow Wilson, speaking for the American Whig British delegate said there had been \"nothing to equal it since Burke\"\u2014brought a long continued ova\u00ad tion. In the football game, watched by many of the delegates as well as by stu\u00ad dents and alumni, Princeton defeated the University of Virginia, 48-0. The torchlight procession, more than a mile long, began behind Nassau Hall, and was led through the town by a picked group of a hundred students, wearing reproductions of the blue and buff uniforms of the Mercer Blues, a Princeton company that had fought in the Revolution. They were followed by a delegation of twenty-five Yale seniors, eight hundred Princeton under\u00ad graduates, and two thousand alumni, representing classes back to 1839. Everyone carried an orange torch or lantern of some kind, and most of the alumni classes wore costumes and car\u00ad ried transparencies. \"It was an un\u00ad forgettable sight,\" William Berryman Scott recalled in his memoirs forty years later; the lights against the red and yellow autumn foliage, he wrote, \"made a fairy scene.\" In front of Nassau Hall, where the procession ended, each class paused, as it passed in review, to cheer President and Mrs. Cleveland. The main features of Nassau Hall, from the ground to the top of the cupola, were outlined in orange electric lights, the front campus was strung with Chinese lanterns, and overhead a full moon shone. Further color was added to the spectacle by fireworks, set off along the front fence on Nassau Street\u2014large dynamite rockets, fiery wheels, bursting bombs, fountains, showers, and set figures, ending with the final \"Good-night, Princeton 1746- 1896.\" On the third morning, the historic City Troop of Philadelphia, whose forebears had served under Washing\u00ad ton in the Battle of Princeton, led a splendidly costumed academic proces\u00ad sion from Marquand Chapel to Alexan\u00ad der Hall for the concluding Sesquicen- tennial anniversary exercises. Presi-440 SEVENTY-NINE HALL dent Patton thanked the delegates for their participation in the celebration and for their continuing interest in Princeton; announced that, despite the business depression, a special commit\u00ad tee on endowment had raised more than $1,350,000 for professorships, fel\u00ad lowships, a new library, and a new dormitory; and, finally, proclaimed that \"from this moment on, what heretofore for one hundred fifty years has been known as the College of New Jersey shall in all future time be known as Princeton University.\" With this an\u00ad nouncement, Professor George Mc\u00ad Lean Harper recorded, \"the audience broke into immense applause . . . [and] cheering, each cheer ending with the triple, 'Princeton University.' \" Following the conferring of fifty- eight honorary degrees, President Cleveland delivered the principal ad\u00ad dress, in which he made a plea for more earnest participation by educated men in the political affairs of the nation; he received a tumultuous ovation. The Sesquicentennial was a turning point in Princeton's history. It marked the occasion when the old college gave way to the new university, and its effects influenced the University's growth years after the celebration was over. Andrew Fleming West demon\u00ad strated organizing talents that he later used as dean of the graduate school, and developed friendships with alumni, which proved invaluable in raising funds for the Graduate College. Presi\u00ad dent Cleveland, warmed by the recep\u00ad tion he had received, came to live in Princeton the following spring; he was elected a university trustee and served as first chairman of its graduate school committee. Henry B. Fine's contacts with foreign scholars, especially with his Sesquicentennial house guest J. J. Thomson, helped him further his ideas for making Princeton a great center for mathematics and science; some of his earliest appointments were students of Thomson. And Woodrow Wilson's cel\u00ad ebrated address, formulating a continu\u00ad ing ideal of Princeton service to the na\u00ad tion, brought him to the fore as a poten\u00ad tial leader of the university\u2014and of the nation. Seventy-Nine Hall was presented to Princeton by Woodrow Wilson's class\u00ad mates in 1904. They said it was a small gift that came from great love or, in the more elegant Latin inscribed above the fireplace in the oak-paneled tower room, EX AMORE MAGNO DONUM PARVUM. This was a modest appraisal of a handsome 25th reunion gift made long before the age of affluence by a class of only 170 members. All their names are recorded in bronze in the vaulted passageway beneath the tower. Seventy-Nine's architect, Benjamin Wistar Morris, Jr., followed the Tudor Gothic style previously employed in Blair and Little but instead of stone used red brick with limestone trim, materials later chosen for neighboring buildings. Gutzon Borglum carved the monkey and tiger grotesques that peer out from the mouldings on the tower arches. The vaulted passageway be\u00ad neath the tower provides a favorite spot for impromptu concerts by under\u00ad graduate singing groups. The tower room, which is large and high, with fine mullioned windows at either end, was used as an office by Woodrow Wilson when he was president of the Univer\u00ad sity. Seventy-Nine was originally a dor\u00ad mitory much coveted by up- perclassmen because of its proximity to the eating clubs. In 1960 when new dormitories were being erected elsewhere on the campus, and in-SLAVIC LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES 441 creased academic office space was needed in this area, Seventy-Nine was converted for use by the philosophy and sociology departments. When sociology moved to Green Hall in 1964, the religion department took its place. For sixty years two lions guarded the Washington Road steps to the passage\u00ad way beneath the tower. Designed by Frederic Auguste Bartholdi, the French sculptor who designed the Statue of Liberty, they were given to the Uni\u00ad versity by the Class of 1879 at their graduation and flanked the front door of Nassau Hall until 1911, when the Class presented the bronze tigers that took their place and moved the lions to Seventy-Nine Hall. Made of soft and malleable \"white metal,\" the lions de\u00ad teriorated with the passage of time and eventually had to be removed to a Uni\u00ad versity storeroom for preservation. Sigma Xi, The Society of, founded in 1887 by a group of undergraduate stu\u00ad dents at Cornell University, has had a Princeton chapter since 1932. There are two classes of membership: full members\u2014faculty and graduate stu\u00ad dents who have published results of scientific research; and associate mem\u00ad bers\u2014graduate and undergraduate students who have shown promise of marked achievement in scientific re\u00ad search. Sir Hugh Taylor was national presi\u00ad dent of Sigma Xi from 1951 until 1953, and editor-in-chief of its publication American Scientist from 1954 to 1969, when its editorial offices were at Princeton. Slavic Languages and Literatures. Russian language instruction at Princeton began during World War II, when a group of interested students asked to have John Turkevich of the Chemistry Department give them a course, and President Dodds granted their petition. Professor Turkevich's ef\u00ad forts were continued by Pierre Eristoff, Professor Turkevich's wife Ludmilla, and eventually, by Valentine Bill, who continued until her retirement in 1974. Russian offerings were later incorpo\u00ad rated into the Department of Modern Languages, and, after it was divided, Russian became a part of Romance Languages, where it remained until an independent Program in Slavic Lan\u00ad guages and Literatures was finally or\u00ad ganized in 1961. Shortly thereafter a graduate program was initiated, and the faculty was expanded considerably, with additions primarily from Yale and Harvard. This period also saw the es\u00ad tablishment of a Program in Russian Studies, in which students could work jointly, while taking courses in Slavic. In 1967 the Program in Slavic became a full-fledged Department of Slavic Lan\u00ad guages and Literatures. In 1971, be\u00ad cause of a budgetary crisis and the ces\u00ad sation of support from the government, the Graduate Program in Slavic was, unfortunately, suspended, but not until it had trained fifteen excellent people who now teach at Harvard, Yale, Co\u00ad lumbia, and Pennsylvania, among other institutions. The Slavic Department now focuses on an excellent under\u00ad graduate program, but continues its ef\u00ad forts to have its Graduate Program re\u00ad stored. The department concentrates much of its activity on a rigorous four-year language program in which all profes\u00ad sors are involved. In addition, a wide variety of Russian and Soviet literature courses are offered, including such in\u00ad dividual authors as Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Solzhenicyn. Advanced courses are often taught primarily or solely in Russian. Undergraduate 442 SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH majors in Slavic may emphasize litera\u00ad ture, but they may also involve them\u00ad selves more directly with the language and study the structure and history of Russian and Slavic. Though Russian it\u00ad self is certainly the main language in the Princeton Slavic Department, a course in Czech is now offered, and Polish and Serbo-Croatian have also been available in the past. The Slavic department maintains close cooperation not only with Russian Studies but also with the Departments of Comparative Literature and Linguis\u00ad tics, and its students frequently take courses in these departments. Charles E. Townsend Smith, Samuel Stanhope 1769 (1751- 1819), was the seventh president of the College and the first alumnus to hold the office. He was born March 15, 1751 (not 1750, as often has been said, even on his tombstone), the year in which his father, Robert Smith, was installed as pastor of the Presbyterian church in Pequea, Pennsylvania. The father was a trustee of the College from 1772 to 1793. Elizabeth, his mother, was a daughter of Samuel Blair, one of its founding trustees. Two younger brothers, John Blair and William Richmond Smith, graduated with the Class of 1773. His own ties to Princeton were strengthened when on June 28, 1775, he married Ann, the oldest daughter of President Witherspoon, whom he would succeed in 1795. Samuel was prepared for college by his father, who conducted a famous school at Pequea, from which Samuel was admitted to the College in 1767 as a member of the junior class. Having ex\u00ad celled in mathematics and having be\u00ad come one of the earlier members of the Whig Society, he graduated two years later with the highest honor of deliver\u00ad ing the Latin salutatory address at commencement. He returned to Pequea to assist his father in the school and to begin with him the study of the\u00ad ology. In 1770 he was brought back as a tutor to Princeton, where he continued his preparation for the ministry with Witherspoon. Licensed to preach in 1773, he went then as a missionary to Virginia. There Smith had a leading part in the founding of two academies. One of them, located first in Augusta County, later became Washington College and still later Washington and Lee Univer\u00ad sity. Prince Edward Academy, of which Smith was appointed first rector in 1775, became in 1783 Hampden- Sydney College. He also assumed a lead in bringing the support of Virginia's Presbyterians to the hope of Jefferson and Madison for the separation of church and state. In 1779 he was called back to Princeton as Professor of Moral Philosophy. Smith and his family reached Princeton in December, taking up res\u00ad idence in the President's House, as Witherspoon moved to Tusculum, the house and farm he owned outside the village. Smith would occupy the Presi\u00ad dent's House (now Maclean House) for almost 33 years, one of the longest ten\u00ad ures in the some 220 years of its his\u00ad tory. Witherspoon, who remained ac\u00ad tive in the affairs of state and church, promptly turned over a large part of his administrative responsibilities to his son-in-law, who was named vice presi\u00ad dent in 1786. As the venerable presi\u00ad dent advanced in years, becoming to\u00ad tally blind during the last three years of his life, Smith's responsibilities grew. On Witherspoon's death in 1794 there was no question as to who should sue-SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH 443 ceed him, and no problems of transition into the new administration. Tall and well proportioned, with finely formed features and noticeably blue eyes, Smith by all accounts was an unusually handsome man who paid close attention to his dress and man\u00ad ners. Archibald Alexander recalled that when he first saw him at a meeting of the Presbyterian General Assembly he thought him the most elegant person he ever had seen. Elegance seems also to have contributed to his fame as a pulpit orator. There is an oft-repeated story, probably apocryphal, that his brother John once said to him: \"You don't preach Jesus Christ and Him crucified, but Sam Smith and him dig\u00ad nified.\" Any one who turns to the col\u00ad lection of his sermons published in 1799, or to the two volume edition of them brought out after his death, will be impressed by their quality and their readability even today. President Smith was fortunate in the reputation he enjoyed as a scholar. Elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1785, he delivered before that body An Essay on the Causes of the Variety of Complexion and Figure in the Human Species. It argued that all mankind belonged to the same fam\u00ad ily, and attributed diversity within the species to environmental influences. Although the paper brought nothing original to discussion of an old ques\u00ad tion, it displayed a respectable com\u00ad mand of the existing literature, and was important enough, after its initial pub\u00ad lication at Philadelphia, to be reprinted at Edinburgh and London, and to bring attacks from other scholars which caused Smith to respond with an en\u00ad larged edition in 1810. Above all, the Essay expressed Smith's abiding faith that there could be no conflict between science and revealed religion. That faith provides the key to his educational policies at Princeton. Without challenging the fundamental place of classical languages and litera\u00ad ture in education, he sought more time for the study of science and modern languages. One device was to strengthen requirements for admission so that further classical instruction might be limited to the first year. Another proposal, with agreement of the trustees in 1799 that was withdrawn in 1809, was to allow students to pursue a special program leading to a certifi\u00ad cate of achievement, a significant step toward the later Bachelor of Science degree. Smith did not achieve all that he hoped for in the way of curricular re\u00ad form, but his achievements in other areas were impressive. The College in 1795 was still struggling to recover from the disastrous effects of the war years. Especially critical was the finan\u00ad cial problem. Smith's success in getting from the state legislature in 1796 a grant of \u00a3600 per year for three years provided only partial relief. The grant was not renewed, and the College re\u00ad mained primarily dependent upon tui\u00ad tion fees for its income. An enrollment of just above 75 students in 1794 had grown to a total of 182 in 1805, and the 54 A.B. degrees awarded in 1806 was the largest number since the founding of the College. A faculty of two profes\u00ad sors, including the president, had grown to one of four professors in addi\u00ad tion to the president, the usual two or three tutors, and an instructor in French. Among the professors was John Maclean, a graduate of Edinburgh whose special interest was chemistry. Faculty minutes, which had their be\u00ad ginning in 1787 and for a time dealt al\u00ad most exclusively with a nagging prob\u00ad lem of student discipline, reveal that 444 SOCCER the faculty increasingly was consulted on academic questions. Smith himself continued to carry a teaching schedule that any modern teacher will regard as unbelievably heavy. The two volumes of his Lectures . . . on . . . Moral and Political Philoso\u00ad phy published in 1812 testify to the high quality of the instruction he gave. He acutely estimated the special oppor\u00ad tunity the College faced in the light of its history and the growing competition from other colleges. He was fond of de\u00ad scribing Princeton as a mecca for stu\u00ad dents drawn from the region reaching southward from the Hudson to Georgia. How accurate was the esti\u00ad mate is suggested by the origins of stu\u00ad dents attending the College in January 1805. From New Jersey there were 32, Pennsylvania 31, Maryland 28, Virginia 22, South Carolina 13, and Georgia 9. Of the other states, only New York had as many as Georgia. The high point in Smith's presidency came just after the fire that in 1802 de\u00ad stroyed Nassau Hall. The constituency of the College rallied to its support so well that funds were raised not only for the reconstruction of Nassau Hall but for the addition of two new buildings to flank it on the front campus, Stanhope Hall and Philosophical Hall, which no longer stands. Except for the unhappy sequel that followed, this would have to be described as an unqualified tribute to the man who headed the institution. The sequel is not easily explained. A student riot in 1807, resulting from Smith's mishandling of a problem of discipline, brought the suspension of 125 students and a growing distrust by the trustees of the president. For some of them his educational reforms had gone too far, and there was discontent over the declining number of students preparing for the ministry. Enroll\u00adments declined, four professors re\u00ad signed, Maclean the last in 1812. In that year, too, Smith was given no choice but to resign. He was provided a pension and a house. He died on Au\u00ad gust 21, 1819. W. Frank Craven Soccer became an organized sport at Princeton on the evening of November 2, 1905, when several dozen under\u00ad graduates crowded into 2 Middle Dod in response to a call in that morning's Prince for a meeting of \"all men inter\u00ad ested in forming an association football team.\" Less than a month later, Princeton played its first game, defeat\u00ad ing a Merion Cricket Club team, 3 to 0. In the early years, the teams re\u00ad ceived only such coaching as they could procure themselves. For a while they were fortunate in having the services of Jack Taylor, a former All-England soc\u00ad cer player, who gave them what time he could spare from his major occupation\u2014bartender at the old Princeton Inn. The Intercollegiate Association Football League was formed in 1905 by Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Haver- ford, and Penn, and joined by Yale in 1908 and by Princeton in 1911. Princeton competed in this league until 1926, in the larger Intercollegiate Soc\u00ad cer Football Association until 1932, in the Middle Atlantic League until 1955, and after 1955 in the Ivy League. Princeton's best season in the early years came in 1916 when it tied for first place but lost the postseason play-off to Penn, 3 to 2, on a snow-covered field a week before Christmas. Center forward Arthur Preyer '19, who had learned to play soccer in Holland, scored both of Princeton's goals. Two of Penn's three goals were scored by its inside right, an SOCIOLOGY 445 All-American whose name was William Nassau. \"Just how we let this man get away from us,\" the Alumni Weekly commented, \"is a matter worthy of consideration.\" Al Nies, the first full-time coach, who served from 1919 to 1934, saw Princeton soccer through one of its most successful eras. Five of Nies's six\u00ad teen teams were league champions: 1921, 1922, 1925, (tied), and 1927; and five finished second: 1919, 1920, 1923, 1924, and 1932 (tied). Two brothers played leading roles on the 1922 team. Defending Princeton's goal, Captain Crossan Cooper '23 held league rivals to three goals, while, up front at center forward, Joe Cooper '25 scored a third of Princeton's twenty- three points. The 1925 team was unde\u00ad feated but suffered one tie. The 1927 team's record was unmarred by either defeat or tie. Center forward Jack Packard '28 accounted for more than half the goals scored by Princeton in the championship seasons of 1925, 1926, and 1927. Bill Logan was coach from 1935 through 1937 and in his last two years guided Princeton to league cham\u00ad pionships. Jimmie Reed was coach for almost three decades, from 1938 through 1966. His teams won 188 games, lost 103, and tied 33. Six were league champions: 1939, 1940, 1942, 1946 (tied), 1957, and 1960, and three fin\u00ad ished second: 1938, 1941, and 1959. A spirited member of the forward line in the late 1930s was Bob Goheen '40, later freshman soccer coach, and still later sixteenth president of the University. The 1940 team, which won eight games and tied Yale 3 to 3 in the ninth, shared with Penn State the title of Eastern Collegiate champion. The 1942 team, whose record was marred only by a scoreless tie with Yale, was one of Princeton's strongest. In nine games it scored 42 points and allowed only 2, holding all of its oppo\u00ad nents scoreless, except Penn. Leading a well-balanced team were Captain Ward Chamberlain '43 at outside left, Bud Palmer '44 at center halfback, and Chan Brewer '45 at goal. Princeton won the Ivy championship in 1957 and again in 1960. The captain of the 1964 team, Dave Hackett '65, was killed in action in Vietnam; in his memory, his teammates provided a soccer trophy which is awarded annu\u00ad ally. Jack VoIz was coach from 1967 through 1972. Bill Muse, an Ail- American soccer player at Springfield College in Massachusetts in 1968, be\u00ad came coach in 1973. His 1976 team fin\u00ad ished 10-4 overall and 5-2 in the Ivy League, tying with Cornell for second place. Sociology became an independent de\u00ad partment in Princeton only in the 1960s, but in 1895 a course was given with this description: \"Sociology. A his\u00ad torical review ern industrialism. . . . The genesis and development of a science of sociology.\" The instructor was Walter A. WyckofiF 1888 (q.v.), Lecturer in Sociology and later Assistant Professor of Political Economy, who was called \"Weary Wil\u00ad lie\" because from 1891 to 1893 he made his way, mostly on foot, from Connec\u00ad ticut to California, supporting himself as a laborer in order to learn by experi\u00ad ence about America's emerging \"labor problem\" and poverty. Beginning in 1912, the economist Frank A. Fetter (q.v.) continued this ameliorative approach to the new \"in\u00ad dustrialism\" with a course in \"Social Economics.\" After 1913, this course 446 SOCIOLOGY was offered in the Department of Eco\u00ad nomics and Social Institutions, which split off from the Department of His\u00ad tory, Politics, and Economics, set up in 1904 by Woodrow Wilson. The establishment of the Office of Population Research in 1936 provided a further impetus to Sociology through the work of its first director, Frank W. Notestein, and later of demographer- sociologists Dudley Kirk, Kingsley Davis, and Wilbert E. Moore. Under Moore's guidance, Sociology took a more scientific direction, complement\u00ad ing the earlier and continuing interest in social problems and reform. Soon after the Second World War, Frederick F. Stephan joined the department as professor of social statistics along with three younger scholars, Marion J. Levy, Jr., specializing in general theory and East Asia; Melvin M. Tumin, in so\u00ad cial class and race relations; and Gerald W. Breese, in urban studies. In 1948, on the recommendation of an inter\u00ad departmental committee, a doctoral program was established; the first Ph.D. was granted in 1951. Sociology grew slowly in the 1950s. Morroe Berger joined the sociology faculty and also the recently expanded Program in Near Eastern Studies in 1952, adding to Sociology's specializa\u00ad tion in foreign \"area\" studies and com\u00ad parative social structure. In 1954, the Department of Economics and Social Institutions became Economics and Sociology. Growth was rapid in the next decade, beginning in 1960, when the junior partner of Economics and Sociology became the senior partner of the De\u00ad partment of Sociology and Anthropol\u00ad ogy. Charles H. Page came from Smith College to be the first chairman, and he was joined a few years later by Charles F. Westoff, a demographer, and Marvin Bressler, a specialist in the sociology of education. In 1963, the department moved to Green Hall (vacated by the School of Engineering), which it shared with the Psychology Department. Sociologists continued to be active as teacher- scholars and administrators in the Woodrow Wilson School, the Office of Population Research, the \"area\" pro\u00ad grams on East Asia, the Near East and Russia, and the newer Program in Afro-American studies; Bressler headed the Commission on the Future of the College, which conducted a three-year review of undergraduate education at Princeton. In 1965, Anthropology assumed separate status, and the department's title became simply the Department of Sociology. Under the new chairman Westoff and his successor, Bressler, Sociology attracted new faculty mem\u00ad bers and large numbers of students. Suzanne Keller joined as visiting pro\u00ad fessor in 1965 and three years later be\u00ad came the first woman full professor in Princeton's history. During the national crises of the later 1960s, students took a heightened in\u00ad terest in sociology, seeking \"relevance\" to problems of the war in Viet Nam, race and sex relations, and the envi\u00ad ronment. Several young instructors made the subject even more attractive, among them Robert A. Scott and Stephen L. Klineberg, whose course attracted hundreds of undergraduates. The number of undergraduate concen\u00ad trators rose from 20 in 1965 to about 150 in 1969 and 1970, the largest in the University. This great influx ended as student unrest declined. Sociology, under Ber- ger's chairmanship, faced the problem of orderly contraction. Modest, regular growth seemed to have returned by SQUASH 447 1974. Meanwhile the department ac\u00ad quired several new professors: in 1970, Norman Ryder, a demographer who was one of the first Princeton Ph.D.s in sociology, and Gilbert F. Rozman, spe\u00ad cializing in East Asian and Russian Studies; in 1972, Walter L. Wallace, a specialist in general theory and in Afro-American studies; and in 1973, Howard F. Taylor, a social psycholo\u00ad gist, who was also appointed director of the Program in Afro-American Studies. By the mid-1970s, Sociology at Princeton was on a more even course. In the face of rapid change, it had main\u00ad tained a combination of specialization and breadth that saved it from the fluc\u00ad tuations of fashion. The department continued its commitment to effective teaching, and its scholarly work gave it a place, despite its small size, among those ranked highest in the country. Morroe Berger Spelman Halls, completed in 1973, provided the first on-campus apartment living for undergraduates. They were named for Laura Spelman Rockefeller, who, with her husband, John D. Rocke\u00ad feller, Sr., founded Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia, the first American college for black women. A former pub\u00ad lic schoolteacher, Mrs. Rockefeller maintained a life-long interest in educa\u00ad tion, particularly for women. Her grandson, Laurance S. Rockefeller '32, a charter trustee, gave the University $4 million in 1969 to help institute coeducation. Most of the gift was used for Spelman Halls, which helped meet the increased housing needs of an ex\u00ad panded student body. The eight-building complex, which was designed by I. M. Pei and Partners, contains fifty-eight apart\u00ad ments for 220 students. Each unit in\u00adcludes a living and dining area, outside balcony, kitchen, bath, and, typically, four study-bedrooms. Six of the apart\u00ad ments, with single large bedrooms, are for student married couples. Set in a naturally wooded landscape on the western edge of the main cam\u00ad pus, the interdependent halls are ar\u00ad ranged along a diagonal axis extending south from Pyne Hall and Dillon Gym\u00ad nasium in such a way as to preserve vis\u00ad tas and to provide pleasant spaces be\u00ad tween Spelman and its neighbors. An innovative use of pre-cast concrete slabs, glass, and light enabled the ar\u00ad chitects to integrate the eight buildings into an architecturally varied campus, according to one observer, \"in an ele\u00ad gant, respectful, and restrained man\u00ad ner.\" In 1977, Spelman Halls was given an honor award by the American Institute of Architects as a \"distinguished ac\u00ad complishment in architecture.\" Squash became an intercollegiate sport at Princeton in 1929, and within the first five years of competition the Uni\u00ad versity had produced undefeated teams in 1931 and 1932 as well as the 1933 intercollegiate individual champion and the runner-up, William G. Foulke II '34 and his classmate Sheldon Stephens. Six years later Princeton had another champion\u2014Stanley W. Pear\u00ad son, Jr. '41. John Conroy, who became coach in 1940, said his major problem was mak\u00ad ing undergraduates understand that squash was something else besides \"a vegetable they don't like.\" Judging by his thirty-year won-lost record (184-69 for a winning percentage of .727), the problem was not insoluble. His teams won national championships in dual meet competition in 1942, 1943, and 1955 (finishing second in 1960, 1964, 448 WALTER TERENCE STACE and 1965), and in post-season tourna\u00ad ments in 1959 and 1960 (finishing sec\u00ad ond in 1961). Seven national collegiate individual championships were won by Princeton players during Conroy's years: in 1941 and 1942 by Charles M. Brinton '42, in 1954 and 1955 by Roger Campbell '55, and in 1959, 1960, and 1961 by Stephen T. Vehslage '61\u2014first three-time win\u00ad ner in the history of the championship. Princeton's first national intercollegiate doubles championship was won in 1953 by Charles Warner '53 and Benjamin F. Edwards III '53. Conroy retired at the end of the 1969 season. He was succeeded by his assist\u00ad ant coach, William M. Summers, who in turn was succeeded, in the fall of 1974, by David A. Benjamin, a former squash star and tennis captain at Har\u00ad vard. Varsity squash continued to flourish in the seventies after the move from the old courts at Dillon to the new ones in Jadwin, which the New York Times called \"the nation's finest squash facili\u00ad ties.\" From 1975 through 1978, Prince\u00ad ton squash teams led by Coach Dave Benjamin achieved one of the most im\u00ad pressive four-year records in Princeton athletic history. In dual meet competi\u00ad tion they won the nine-man national championship with undefeated seasons in 1975, 1977, and 1978, and placed sec\u00ad ond in 1976 to Harvard, which gave Princeton its only defeat in four years. In the post-season intercollegiate championship tournaments, Princeton won the six-man team title in 1976 and again in 1978\u2014the first time Princeton won both championships in the same year. In addition to their success in inter\u00ad collegiate competition, Princetonians have won the men's national cham\u00ad eight times: Strachan and 1939; Charles M. Brin\u00ad ton '42 in 1941, 1942, 1946, and 1947; Stanley W. Pearson, Jr. '41 in 1948; Stephen T. Vehslage '61 in 1965. Princeton alumni were also men's na\u00ad tional doubles champions three years running: Strachan and Brinton in 1946, Pearson and David McMullin '30 in 1947, Brinton and Pearson in 1948. WOMEN'S SQUASH Women's teams, coached by six-time national champion Betty Constable, earned an A+ in their early years. Un\u00ad defeated in 1972, their first season, they captured four successive national collegiate championships from 1973 through 1976, won a fifth in 1978, and produced five national collegiate cham\u00ad pions\u2014Wendy Zaharko '74 in 1972, 1974, and 1975; Sally Fields '73 in 1973; and Nancy Gengler '78 in 1976. Stace, Walter Terence (1886-1967), Stuart Professor of Philosophy for twenty years, grew up in an English military family (his great-grandfather, General William Stace, served in the Battle of Waterloo), and it was expected that, like his father and brother, he would follow a military career. In his teens, however, he experienced a reli\u00ad gious conversion and entered Trinity College, Dublin, with a view to a career in the Anglican Church. At Trin\u00ad ity, he became interested in systematic philosophy, but on graduation, yielding to family pressure, he entered the Brit\u00ad ish Civil Service. From 1910 to 1932, he served in various posts in the gov\u00ad ernment of Ceylon; there is still a Stace Street in Colombo, where he was mayor for many years. At the same time, he continued to study philoso\u00ad phy; every morning he was awakened with early tea at six to read and write for two hours before breakfast. In this STATISTICS 449 way he produced three books: A Critical History of Greek Philosophy, The Philosophy of Hegel, and The Meaning of Beauty. He was called to Princeton in 1932 and appointed Stuart Professor of Phi\u00ad losophy in 1935. After coming to the University he published a book-length poem, many scholarly articles, and books of major importance in the theory of knowledge, metaphysics, ethics, social and political thought, and the philosophy of religion. One book won an American Council of Learned Societies award, another the Reynal and Hitchcock prize. His publications, according to the New York Times, es\u00ad tablished him as \"one of the preemi\u00ad nent the English- speaking world.\" Stace was an empiricist in the British tradition. Professor James Ward Smith, a colleague and former student, has said that his basic position was that em\u00ad piricism does not require the confine\u00ad ment of belief to propositions that are in any strict sense demonstrable. The boy who had experienced re\u00ad ligious conversion [Professor Smith wrote] . . . \"Either God is a He is nothing at all,\" Stace wrote. \"To ask for a proof of the existence of God is on a par with asking for a proof of the existence of beauty. If God does not lie at the end of any telescope, neither does he lie at the end of any syllogism. ...\" Stanhope Hall, the University's third oldest building, was erected in 1803. It originally housed the college library, study halls, and the two literary societies, Whig and Clio, and was called the Library. Later it contained the \"geological cabinet\" and lecture rooms and was known as Geological Hall. Still later it contained the offices of the treasurer and the superintendent of Grounds and Buildings and, for a time, the meeting room of the Faculty and was called the College Offices and then the University Offices. In 1915 the trustees gave it its present name in honor of Samuel Stanhope Smith, who was president when it was built. In re\u00ad cent years Stanhope has housed the University's communications and secu\u00ad rity offices. Another building, an exact duplicate of the present Stanhope, was also built in 1803 on the other side of Nassau Hall facing the \"Library.\" In its basement were the college kitchen and refectory, on its upper floors rooms for the col\u00ad lege's \"philosophical apparatus\" and for the classes in mathematics and natural philosophy. Known at first as the Refec\u00ad tory it was later called Philosophical Hall. It was here that Joseph Henry conducted his experiments in elec- tromagnetism and in telegraphy. Philo\u00ad sophical Hall was razed in 1873 to make room for Chancellor Green library. Statistics at Princeton was the creation of Luther P. Eisenhart and Samuel S. Wilks. Its history falls naturally into four periods; Wilks alone, World War II, postwar under Wilks, the early years as a department. Dean Eisenhart's vision brought Wilks to Princeton's Department of Mathematics in 1933. For the next eight or ten years, Wilks was the lone statistician in that department, building a sequence of courses, stimulating un\u00ad dergraduates, and starting to turn out Ph. D.'s. Much of his important re\u00ad search was carried out and published during this era. His influence on a vari\u00ad ety of areas of application grew rapidly, 450 STATISTICS and his editorship of the Annals of Mathematical Statistics carried that journal through its crucial and forma\u00ad tive decades. His pattern of \"write mathematics, and do applications\" be\u00ad came well established and was thor\u00ad oughly conveyed to his students. During World War II Wilks became deeply involved in the activities of the National Defense Research Commit\u00ad tee, both in the Applied Mathematics Panel and at Princeton, where SRG-P (Statistical Research Group-Princeton) and its branch at Columbia (\"SRG-P Jr\") involved graduate students T. W. Anderson, P. J. McCarthy, F. Mostel- ler and D. F. Votaw, and brought in R. L. Anderson, W. G. Cochran, A. M. Mood, L. S. Savage, J. W. Tukey, J. D. Williams, and C. P. Winsor for varying periods. (Many of these names were to become familiar to statisticians in the decades that followed.) Merrill Flood became responsible for the Fire Control Research Group, involving in addition to mathemati\u00ad cians, physiologists, and engineers, C. P. J. W. Tukey, a chemist-turned-topologist- turned-statistician, and G. W. Brown, a mathematician-turned-statistician. During these years the flavor was, of course: \"do crucial applications, and any mathematics that can help.\" This increase in the number of statis\u00ad ticians made statistics much more vis\u00ad ible in Princeton (and vice versa) and must have played a part in the adminis\u00ad tration's approval of a Section of Math\u00ad ematical Statistics in the Department of Mathematics. This section, which ini\u00ad tially consisted of Wilks, Tukey (part- time Princeton, part-time Bell Tele\u00ad phone Labs), and usually a visitor, grew in 1956 by the addition of Francis J. Anscombe (a former visitor). The old flavor of \"write mathematics and do ap\u00ad plications\" continued, although some were now much more willing not to look to mathematicians as the source of approval. Undergraduate courses and interest grew somewhat, and there were steady streams of Ph.D.'s and fac\u00ad ulty research. The Korean War stimulated the es\u00ad tablishment of the Analytical Research Group, of which Forman S. Acton was director from 1952 to 1956, and about half of whose work was statistical. George E. P. Box was then brought to Princeton as director of the Statistical Techniques Research Group (1956- 1959), whose participants included E. M.L. Beale, J. Stuart Hunter, Colin Mallows, Mervin E. Muller, and Henry Scheffe. Again there was a larger critical mass and mutual stimulation, with a further broadening of interests and a further recognition of mathe\u00ad matics as important but not all embrac\u00ad ing. After Wilks's death in 1964, with en\u00ad couragement from some mathe\u00ad maticians and the administration, an independent Department of Statistics ,vas formed in 1966. Tukey was its (part-time) chairman from 1966 to 1969 and after an administrative review and approval of expansion, he was suc\u00ad ceeded by Geoffrey S. Watson in 1970. A new stream\u2014undergraduate majors \u2014joined the streams of Ph.D. 's, faculty research, and involvement in statistical applications; emphasis on undergradu\u00ad ate study became comparable with the emphasis on graduate study. Frederick F. Stephan, who had come to Princeton in 1947 in Sociology, trans\u00ad ferred to the new department, broad\u00ad ening its interests significantly. J. Stuart Hunter, who had returned to teach in the School of Engineering in 1968, also took an active role for a time. ADLAI EWING STEVENSON 451 John Hartigan returned in 1964 to help hold the fort and, after Watson's ar\u00ad rival, the department was strengthened by Donald McNeil (1971-1976) and Peter Bloomfield (1971, acting chair\u00ad man 1976-1977) among others. Tukey's interest in data analysis (re\u00ad garded as encompassing statistics), now that the pressure of needing to teach \"mathematics\" was removed, led first to a Freshman course in Explora\u00ad tory Data Analysis and then to a book (preliminary edition 1970-71, first edi\u00ad tion 1977) emphasizing simple arithme\u00ad tic and careful thinking. In December 1974 a PDP 11-40 computer was in\u00ad stalled. Both these steps illustrate the continued broadening in the Depart\u00ad ment's attitude, where very mathe\u00ad matical questions remain important but other Ph.D. theses focus on specific applications or even on the analysis of important sets of data. Robustness (in the technical sense of that word) and time series continue to be strong interests in the department, as they have been for decades. More recently, collaboration with the Office of Population Research and the Center for Environmental Studies has been prominent. The department is proud that the first two chairmen of the De\u00ad partment of Statistics, both at Harvard and at Yale, came from Princeton and that, in the early seventies, those of its undergraduate majors who wished to do their graduate study in statistics were able to do so at Harvard, Stan\u00ad ford, or Yale. John W. Tukey Stevenson, Adlai Ewing (1900-1965), governor of Illinois, twice Democratic candidate for president, and ambas\u00ad sador to the United Nations, was born to politics. His maternal great\u00adgrandfather, Jesse Fell, a founder of the Republican party, was a close friend of Abraham Lincoln and the first to pro\u00ad pose him for the presidency. His pater\u00ad nal grandfather, Adlai E. Stevenson, was vice-president during Grover Cleveland's second term. His father, Lewis Stevenson, also a Democrat, was once secretary of state for Illinois. As a boy of twelve, Adlai accom\u00ad panied his father when he called on Governor Woodrow Wilson at his summer home in Sea Girt to discuss the presidential campaign of 1912. Wilson, Stevenson later recalled, was extremely courteous to him, asking whether he was interested in politics and referring casually to the fact that he had been president of Princeton before becoming governor of New Jersey. \"That's what decided me on going to Princeton, right then, and there,\" Stevenson said. \"I came away with the feeling: I'm his deathless friend. His supporter. His admirer. That's my man.\" At Princeton he studied principally history and literature and although, as he himself said, he \"was never threatened by Phi Beta Kappa,\" it be\u00ad came obvious in later life that he ab\u00ad sorbed a great deal from his reading, lectures, and preceptorials. He joined Whig Hall, took a course in public speaking which he thought \"could prove very worthwhile,\" became man\u00ad aging editor of the Princetonian, and was elected one of the fifteen members of the Senior Council, the original agency of student government. He lived in 42 Patton Hall and took his meals at Quadrangle Club in upperclass years. In the senior class vote at his graduation in 1922, as he informed another senior class thirty-two years later (with characteristic humor at his own expense), he received only eight votes for \"biggest politician\" but 452 ADLAI EWING STEVENSON twenty-eight for \"thinks he is. . . .\" He also received two votes for \"most likely to succeed.\" (\"I still don't know who the other fellow was,\" he said.) As a young lawyer in Chicago, follow\u00ad ing legal studies at Harvard and Northwestern, he developed his skill as a public speaker and his knowledge of world problems while serving as presi\u00ad dent of the Chicago Council on Foreign Affairs. In the early 1930s he spent a year in Washington with the New Deal and during World War II was special assistant first to the secretary of the navy and later to the secretary of state. He was an active participant in the for\u00ad mulation of the charter of the United Nations in San Francisco in 1945, chief of the United States delegation at the meeting of the U.N. Preparatory Commission in London, and a member of the United States delegation at the first three sessions of the General As\u00ad sembly. GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS Stevenson won the governorship of Illinois from the Republican incumbent in 1948 by 572,067 votes\u2014the largest majority ever received in Illinois up to that time. His achievements during his four-year term as governor were impressive. He recruited first-class men\u2014some of them Republicans\u2014for top positions on his staff, eliminated many useless jobs, and instilled a sense of public responsibility in the surviving state employees. He took the state police out of politics, knocked out commercial gambling, started a high\u00ad way improvement program, and over\u00ad hauled the state's welfare system. He almost doubled the state's appropria\u00ad tions for local schools and made its mental health program, which had been one of the worst, very close to the best. His veto messages were remarkable both for substance and for style. He courageously vetoed a bill, overwhelm\u00ad ingly passed by both houses, which would have set up elaborate procedures for detecting subversives and require loyalty oaths of teachers and state offi\u00ad cials: \"Basically, the effect of this legis\u00ad lation . . . will be less the detection of subversives and more the intimidation of honest citizens.\" In a lighter vein, he explained his refusal to approve a bill that sought to protect birds by re\u00ad stricting the movement of cats: \"If we attempt to resolve [this problem] by legislation, who knows but what we may be called upon to take sides as well in the age-old problems of dog versus cat, bird versus bird, even bird versus worm. In my opinion, the state of Il\u00ad linois and its local governing bodies al\u00ad ready have enough to do without trying to control feline deliquency.\" THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS Stevenson was the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for president in 1952 and again in 1956, losing both elections to General Eisenhower. Asked on a television program some time later if he had any advice to give to young politicians, he said, \"Yes, never run against a war hero.\" As a presidential candidate Stevenson elevated American political discussion, beginning with his speech of acceptance in 1952: \"Let's talk sense to the Ameri\u00ad can people. Let's tell them the truth, that there are no gains without pains, that we are now on the eve of great de\u00ad cisions, not easy decisions . . . but a long patient, costly struggle which alone can assure triumph over the great enemies of man\u2014war, poverty and tyranny\u2014and the assaults upon human dignity which are the most grievous consequences of each.\" ADLAI EWING STEVENSON 453 In 1952 when it was not considered politically prudent to tangle with Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, Republi\u00ad can of Wisconsin, Stevenson publicly denounced McCarthyism in the sena- ator's own state. \"Because we believe in the free mind,\" he said, \"we are also fighting those who, in the name of anti-Communism, would assail the community of freedom itself.\" In 1956 he urged a treaty to ban nu\u00ad clear testing even though public opin\u00ad ion polls supported the view of some of his associates that he would lose votes thereby. \"There are worse things than losing an election,\" he said, \"the worst thing is to lose one's convictions and not tell the people the truth.\" Although he failed to win two presi\u00ad dential elections, Stevenson exercised extraordinary influence on American politics in his time. He attracted a large group of young college people into the active ranks of the Democratic party. As one of them (Richard Goodwin, Harvard '52) said, \"He told an entire generation there was room for intelli\u00ad gence and idealism in public life, that politics was not just a way to live but a way to live greatly.\" Stevenson lost his party's nomination in 1960 to John F. Kennedy but, as Ar\u00ad thur Schlesinger, Jr., pointed out, the transformation of the Democratic party in the 1950s was largely Stevenson's work and \"by 1960 the candidates . . . were talking in the Stevenson idiom.\" HIS WIT AND HUMOR Stevenson also brought to the hurly-burly of politics a lively imagina\u00ad tion and a ready wit. During the 1952 campaign, a news photographer caught a picture of him with a large hole in the sole of his shoe. \"Better a hole in the shoe than a hole in the head,\" said Stevenson, and the hole in the shoe be\u00ad came a campaign symbol. Partly because of his appeal to the in\u00ad tellect, partly because of his balding head, his opponents called him and his supporters \"eggheads.\" In his Godkin Lectures at Harvard (published as Call to Greatness) he admitted that \"Via ovicipitum dura est, or . . . the way of the egghead is hard.\" On election day in 1952 he gave a talk to schoolchildren in front of a poll\u00ad ing place near his home on \"this busi\u00ad ness of voting\" and to break the ice at the beginning said: \"I would like to ask all of you children to indicate, by hold\u00ad ing up your hands, how many of you would like to be Governor of Illinois, the way I am?\" After a show of hands, he said, \"Well, that's almost unanimous. Now, I would like to ask all of the gov\u00ad ernors if they would like to be one of you kids,\" and then raised his hand, exclaiming \"yeh, yeh, yeh.\" Sometime later, he asked a Radcliffe commencement audience, \"Do you know the difference between a beauti\u00ad ful woman and a charming one?\" and then responded, \"A beauty is a woman you notice; a charmer is one who notices you.\" AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS On his inauguration in 1961, Presi\u00ad dent Kennedy appointed Stevenson ambassador to the United Nations, and Stevenson served in that post until his death. During his four and a half years as ambassador he was probably the best known and most popular representative at the United Nations. Of the 116 gov\u00ad ernments then represented there were only six whose capitals he had not vis\u00ad ited and whose leaders he had not talked with. Soon after he took office he visited the respresentatives of all 116 governments. 454 STEVENSON HALL He was especially appreciated by representatives of the developing na\u00ad tions. \"He had that quality,\" said Bar\u00ad bara economist, \"for which the Africans . . . . . the Bantu word for the gift of making life rather larger and more vivid for everyone else.\" He was admired for his eloquence and for the moderation and reason he brought to discussions. \"Even when policies and interests diverged vio\u00ad lently,\" Miss Ward wrote, he remained \"a symbol of America's readiness to live within the limits of civilized and re\u00ad sponsible power.\" Speaking to the United Nations Eco\u00ad nomic and Social Council in Geneva [on July 9, 1965,] Stevenson declared: We travel together, passengers on a little space ship, dependent on its vulnerable reserves of air and soil; all committed for our safety to its secu\u00ad rity and peace; preserved from an\u00ad nihilation only by the care, the work, and I will say, the love we give our fragile craft. We cannot maintain it half fortunate, half miserable, half confident, half despairing, half slave\u2014to the ancient enemies of man\u2014half free in a liberation of re\u00ad sources undreamed of until this day. No craft, no crew can travel with such vast contradictions. On their resolution depends the survival of us all. Five days later, while visiting in Eng\u00ad land on his return from Geneva, Stevenson fell dead of a heart attack on a London sidewalk. \"To the public dialogue of his time he brought intelli\u00ad gence, civility and grace,\" the New York Times said in tribute, \"We who have been his contemporaries have been companions of greatness.\" Stevenson was awarded an honorary LL. D. by the University in 1954 and was the 1963 recipient of the Woodrow Wilson Award for his exemplification of Wilsons phrase, \"Princeton in the Na\u00ad tion's Service.\" He is memorialized at Princeton by Stevenson Hall, an open membership social and dining facility, and also by a bronze bust (sculptured by Elizabeth Gordon) in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and Interna\u00ad tional Affairs and a stained glass win\u00ad dow (designed by Ellen Simon) in the University Chapel, both of which were given by his Class of 1922. On a marble pedestal supporting the bust are carved these words of Stevenson: And now we shall have to address ourselves to the unending tasks of greatness. For the quest for peace and security is not a day's or a dec\u00ad ade's work. For us it may be everlast\u00ad ing. Stevenson Hall was formed as a non- bicker University-managed dining facil\u00ad ity at the initiative of undergraduate students in the Classes of 1968 and '69 when it became apparent that the orig\u00ad inal Court Club and Key and Seal Club would not long remain economically successful institutions. Stevenson was formed with approximately 130 mem\u00ad bers to occupy these buildings, at 83 and 91 Prospect Avenue, in response to growing student calls for a \"viable social alternative,\" i.e., an alternative to membership in one of the traditional Prospect Avenue clubs. Malcolm Diamond (Religion) served as first Master, 1969-1971. He was suc\u00ad ceeded by Gerald Garvey (Politics), 1971-1974, followed by Maitland Jones (Chemistry), whose wife, Susan Hock- aday, served as full Co-Master, 1974- 1977. RICHARD STOCKTON 455 In the early years, Stevenson Hall membership gained a reputation for strong commitment to political activism\u2014but activism \"within the sys\u00ad tem.\" During the Cambodia con\u00ad troversy in the spring of 1970, for example, the suggestion for a regular midterm University recess to permit active student participation in political campaigns originated at a Stevenson Hall protest meeting. During the same period, Stevenson Hall became a focal point of the Movement for a New Con\u00ad gress. It also served as the headquar\u00ad ters for various campaign efforts on be\u00ad half of insurgent (i.e., anti-Vietnam War) candidates for the U.S. Congress. Through the early 1970s, the Ste\u00ad venson Hall membership broadened. Sophomores were permitted to become full members in 1972. The same year, a Kosher dining facility was opened in the building at 83 Prospect; freshmen desiring to keep the dietary laws were admitted to membership in this sec\u00ad tion. The Kosher section represents the first of its type in any Ivy League uni\u00ad versity. Membership in the Kosher sec\u00ad tion grew in the first four years from 35 to 145. The membership has also become in\u00ad creasingly diversified as liberal arts and engineering members have joined Stevenson Hall, along with the Wood- row Wilson School majors, historians and political scientists who have tradi\u00ad tionally favored the Hall. Gerald Garvey Stockton, Richard 1748 (1730-1781), a member of the first graduating class, and the first alumnus elected a trustee, was born in Princeton of a Quaker fam\u00ad ily that was among the community's earliest settlers. His grandfather came to the colonies in 1696 and a few years later acquired from William Penn a large tract of land that embraced the present borough of Princeton. His father inherited the portion of the property that included the dwelling later named \"Morven\" where Richard was born, and was, for many years, presiding judge of the court of common pleas; a liberal patron of the College, the elder Stocktons influence contrib\u00ad uted to its being located in Princeton. Richard received his preparatory education at Samuel Finley's (q.v.) academy in Nottingham, Maryland, and graduated from the College in 1748 when it was still located in Newark. All of his five classmates went into the ministry. Stockton read law in the Newark office of David Ogden, a lead\u00ad ing member of the New Jersey bar, and was admitted to the bar in 1754. He opened an office in Princeton and ac\u00ad quired a reputation for being the most eloquent and persuasive advocate in New Jersey. Among the able young men who read law with him were Joseph Reed 1757 and Jonathan Dick\u00ad inson Sergeant 1762, both of whom later served as attorney general of Pennsylvania, and William Paterson 1763 (q.v.), later attorney general and governor of New Jersey. In 1757, when he was twenty-seven, Stockton was elected a trustee of the College. Ten years later, while on an extended visit in Great Britain, he was asked to go to Scotland to extend to John Witherspoon the trustees' invita\u00ad tion to succeed the recently deceased Samuel Finley as president of the Col\u00ad lege. Stockton was \"successful in re\u00ad moving all the objections which origi\u00ad nated in Witherspoon's mind,\" but not those in Mrs. Witherspoon's, and he wrote his wife, \"I have engaged all the eminent clergymen in Edinburgh and Glasgow to attack her in her intrench-456 THE STREET LIBRARY ments, and they are determined to take her by storm, if nothing else will do.\" Finally, with the help of Benjamin Rush 1760 (q.v.), then a medical stu\u00ad dent at the University of Edinburgh, Mrs. Witherspoon was persuaded to consent, and her husband accepted the call. After his return, Stockton took an in\u00ad creasingly active part in the political life of the Province of New Jersey. In 1768 he was made a member of its council and in 1774 a judge of its supreme court. Elected a delegate to the Conti\u00ad nental Congress on June 22, 1776, he took his seat in Philadelphia in time to hear the closing debate on the Declara\u00ad tion of Independence and to sign it along with Witherspoon and Rush. Two months later, in a vote by the state legislature, he was narrowly defeated for the governorship of New Jersey by William Livingston, and was then cho\u00ad sen first chief justice of the state, but declined this office, preferring to con\u00ad tinue in the Continental Congress. The following November, when Brit\u00ad ish troops were rapidly approaching Princeton, Stockton took his family to the home of a friend in Monmouth County for safekeeping. While there, he was betrayed to the British by Loyalists and was dragged in bitterly cold weather to Perth Amboy. He was later taken to New York and put in the notorious Provost Jail, where he suf\u00ad fered brutal treatment until January 3, 1777, when a formal remonstrance from Congress led to his release. Upon Stockton's return to Princeton, it became known (according to a letter from President Witherspoon to his son, David) that during his imprisonment the British had persuaded him to sign General Howe's Declaration, which required an oath of allegiance to the King\u2014an act Stockton revoked later that year by signing oaths of adjuration and allegiance prescribed by the New Jersey legislature. His health shat\u00ad tered, his estate pillaged, his fortune depleted, he continued to live in Princeton, an invalid, until his death from cancer on February 28, 1781, in his fifty-first year. \"It was one of his ear\u00ad liest honors to have been a son of this college,\" said Vice President Samuel Stanhope Smith at Stockton's funeral in Nassau Hall, \"and it was one of the first honors of his college to have given birth to such a son.\" He was buried in the Quaker burial ground at Stony Brook Meeting House. Stockton's wife was Annis Boudinot, daughter of a merchant and silversmith who was for a time postmaster of Princeton. Their eldest daughter Julia married Benjamin Rush. Stockton's de\u00ad scendants occupied prominent places in the College and town, the state, and the nation. Among them were a United States secretary of the treasury, Richard Rush 1797; two judges of superior courts; three state attorneys general; and four United States senators. A portrait of Stockton hangs in the Art Museum, one of his wife, in the John Maclean House. The Stockton family home, Morven, became the offi\u00ad cial residence of the governor of New Jersey in 1951. New Jersey's Richard Stockton State College was dedicated in his honor in 1971. Street Library, The, which is a wing of Wilcox Hall, was given in 1961 by Graham D. Mattison '26 in memory of the writer Julian Street (1879-1947), who lived in Princeton in the 1920s and befriended many undergraduates, of whom Mattison was one. The Street Library provides residents of Woodrow Wilson College with a selection of some STUDENT GOVERNMENT 457 ten thousand books in greatest demand by undergraduates. Mattisons gift built the library and purchased the original selection of books; it also provided an endowment for the addition of new books each year. Street, whose son, Julian Street, Jr., graduated from Princeton in 1925, wrote that \"as an outsider\" he was fas\u00ad cinated by college life in Princeton as a \"vision of. . . life in miniature.\" Before coming here to live he had collaborated with Booth Tarkington 1893 in writing a comedy, The Country Cousin, which had a successful run on Broadway. Dur\u00ad ing the decade that he lived in Princeton, Street wrote a novel and three volumes of short stories, one of which (\"Mr. Bisbee's Princess\") won the O'Henry Prize for 1925. He was best known as a gourmet and author of books on wine, food, and travel. Student government did not begin at Princeton until the turn of the century, but its essential spirit was evident years earlier. In James Madison 1771's time, the debating and literary societies, Whig and Clio, were governed entirely by undergraduates, and their strict par\u00ad liamentary rules were sometimes applied with severity to erring faculty graduate members. During Woodrow Wilson 1879's undergraduate years, athletic, literary, and musical activities were all student-governed, and in the 1890s a later generation saw the begin\u00ad ning of another form of undergraduate self-government\u2014the student-con\u00ad trolled honor system in examinations (q.v.)\u00b7 Princeton's first formal agency of student government, the Senior Council, was founded in June 1905 on the initiative of undergraduates in the Class of 1906 and welcomed by Presi\u00ad dent Wilson as a means of calling lead\u00aders of undergraduate opinion into con\u00ad sultation with trustees and faculty \"upon matters of moment in which it was not only proper but desirable that authority should wait upon opinion.\" Although the Senior Council profited from the experience and influence of its members, its weakness was its lack of continuity; each year its membership was entirely new\u2014a disadvantage that became particularly apparent in the 1920s when, after the Council had failed to produce an acceptable system of regulations for the safe use of au\u00ad tomobiles by undergraduates, the trus\u00ad tees issued an edict forbidding student car use after July 1, 1927. The 1927 Senior Council thereupon resigned, and although the reason given was that they had not been properly consulted, the underlying difficulty in President Hibben's view was one of continuity and the Council's understandable re\u00ad luctance to make decisions \"which would not affect their own liberty but would affect only their successors.\" The following fall, an Undergraduate Council representing all four classes was formed to replace the Senior Council. Among the products of its forty-year existence were a marriage course for seniors, chartered flights to Europe, an extension of Firestone Li\u00ad brary hours, an increase in carrel space for upperclassmen, and the end of re\u00ad quired chapel attendance. The Council also agitated successfully for the repeal of the edict prohibiting student use of automobiles, the improvement of club elections, the development of alterna\u00ad tive social facilities, and the extension of curfew hours for women visitors in dormitories. The late sixties and mid-seventies found Princeton student government in a state of flux. In 1967 the Under\u00ad graduate Council gave way to a larger 458 SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Undergraduate Assembly designed to provide wider student participation through the campus-wide election of representatives from dormitory areas and the scheduling of frequent meet\u00ad ings open to any undergraduate who wanted to attend. According to one student observer, the Assembly was \"more constructively vocal\" than the old Council. But the operation of the larger organization proved unwieldy, attendance fell off, and in time, the As\u00ad sembly, like its predecessor, was being criticized for its failure to effectively represent student opinion, and was ac\u00ad cordingly superseded in 1975 by a body known as the Undergraduate Student Government. The new organization gave more power to existing committees on aca\u00ad demic matters and undergraduate life and to the projects board, and replaced the old Assembly with the Under\u00ad graduate Caucus, a smaller deliberative body made up of student government officers, committee chairmen, class presidents, class delegates, and the un\u00ad dergraduate members of the Council of the Princeton University Community (q-v.). Supreme Court of the United States, since its establishment in 1789, has numbered among its justices eight Princeton graduates. With the presi\u00ad dents who appointed them, they are: WASHINGTON William Paterson 1763 (NJ.) 1793-1806 *01iver Ellsworth (Henry) Brockholst Livingston 1774 (N. Y.) 1806-1823 MONROE Smith Thompson 1788 (N.Y.) 1823-1843 JACKSON James Moore Wayne 1808 (Ga.) 1835-1867 TAFT Mahlon Pitney 1879 (NJ.) 1912-1922 EISENHOWER John Marshall Harlan '20 (N. Y.) 1955-1971 * Chief Justice Swimming at Princeton got off to a good start in the spring of 1906 with a victory over Yale in that season's only meet. The following year, the 1907 team won every meet in Princeton's first full sea\u00ad son, taking the championship of the newly founded Intercollegiate Swim\u00ad ming Association; and a year later the 1908 team won the association's post\u00ad season meet to determine individual championships. Frank Sullivan was coach from 1911 to 1928. His 1912 team defeated Yale but lost to Penn, finishing second in the league. His 1924 team won the league championship, beating Yale twice in close contests, while going undefeated in dual meet competition. The first of the two defeats of the Elis broke their seven-year string of 44 straight intercol\u00ad legiate victories. Both meets were de\u00ad cided in the final event by Princeton's victorious 200-yard relay team, whose anchorman, John H. Hawkins '26, won the national collegiate championship in the 440-yard free-style the following year. When Sullivan suddenly resigned in 1928, the University accepted Yale's offer to lend its assistant coach, How\u00ad ard W. Stepp, for the rest of the season\u2014and then kept him at SWIMMING 459 Princeton as swimming coach for twenty-five years and as Registrar from 1947 until his retirement in 1969. Stepp's teams won 162 of their 228 meets for an overall percentage of .711. His 1938 team was the first to beat perennial champion Yale since 1924. Stepp swimmers included seven na\u00ad tional collegiate Moles, Jr. '39, and Robert L. Van '39 in the 300-yard medley relay. In 1939 Hough was awarded the N.C.A.A. Trophy as the \"outstanding swimmer of the year.\" Another Stepp swimmer, Howard L. Canoune '37 followed his mentor as varsity coach for five years from 1953 to 1958. Robert L. Clotworthy (Ohio State '53), 1956 Olympic gold medalist in the three-meter dive, was coach from 1958 to 1970. \"A bubbly little man who treats swimming with . . . an enthusiastic rev\u00ad erence\" (in the words of Frank Deford '61), Clotworthy guided his 1962 swimmers to Princeton's first Eastern Seaboard team championship, and his twelve teams scored 104 victories in 148 dual meets for a winning percent\u00ad age of .703. He trained three national collegiate champions: G. Gardiner Green, Jr. '63 (100-yard breast stroke), Jed R. Graef '64 (200-yard backstroke), and Ross E. Wales '69 (100-yard but\u00ad terfly). Graef won an Olympic gold medal, in world-record time, in the 200-meter backstroke in 1964, and Wales was bronze medalist in the 100-meter butterfly at the 1968 Olym\u00ad pics. Clotworthy's successor in 1970 was William W. Farley (Michigan '66), 1964 Olympic bronze medalist in the 1500- meter freestyle. His 1972 team, which completed Princeton's first undefeated season since 1924, captured the East\u00ad ern League championship and further distinguished itself by beating Yale by the widest Princeton margin achieved up to then\u201483 to 31. In 1973 Princeton won its first East\u00ad ern Seaboard title since 1962, outscor- ing North Carolina by 120 points, as Captain Charles Campbell '73 earned four gold medals and Curtis Hayden '75, three, in individual and relay events. Farley's 1974 team, which crushed Yale 91 to 22 during the regular season, won Princeton's second straight East\u00ad ern Seaboard championship with a breathtaking 419 to 411 victory over Harvard, accomplished in the last event of the meet when Princeton's 400-yard freestyle relay anchorman, MaI Howard '75, outstretched his Crimson opponent by half a stroke and touched home 47-100ths of a second sooner. Entering the last day of the Eastern Seaboard championships in 1975, Princeton trailed North Carolina by 13 points, but a one-two-three sweep by Joe Loughran '77, Curtis Hayden '75, and Rob Maass '78 in the 1650-yard freestyle, and winning scores for diver Bill Heinz '75 on the three-meter board, helped Princeton pull ahead by nine points to win its third successive Eastern Seaboard title. Runner-up in both the 1-meter and 3-meter dives at the 1974 N.C.A.A. Championships, Heinz was a student of two-time Olympic gold medalist Bob Webster (diving coach from 1966 to 1975), who also trained Eastern cham\u00ad pions Holt Maness '69, John Huffstut-460 Landstreet '72, and Cece Herron '74, Princeton's first woman diving champion. Webster was succeeded by John Andrews '63 in 1975 and by another Olympic gold medalist, Leslie Bush Hickcox, in 1976. The 1976 Princeton swimmers shared the Eastern title with Harvard and then outpointed them 344 to 252 in the Eastern Seaboard meet to win that championship for the fourth successive year. In 1977, Princeton completed an un\u00ad defeated season, won the league cham\u00ad pionship outright, and came from be\u00ad hind to beat Harvard 344 to 309 for an unprecedented fifth straight Eastern Seaboard title. That year's team, which Bill Farley said was the \"best we've ever had,\" was the first to win both league and the Eastern Seaboard championship titles. In 1978, after losing out to Harvard for the dual-meet championship by a bare .69 second in the closing 400-yard freestyle relay, Princeton came back a month later to beat Harvard in the same event, with an Eastern Seaboard record time that gave Princeton its sixth straight Eastern Seaboard cham\u00ad pionship. WOMEN'S SWIMMING TEAMS Intercollegiate swimming by Princeton women began informally, and auspiciously, in 1971 when a freshman and a sophomore entered the Eastern Intercollegiate Women's championships and together scored enough points to win fifth place for Princeton\u2014Jane Fremon '75 by setting new Eastern records in the butterfly and the 100- and 200-yard freestyle, Cece Herron '74 by finishing second in a field of seventeen divers. A women's team was formally organ\u00ad ized the following year, and from 1972 through 1975, Princeton women placed third, second, and then first twice in succession in the Eastern Intercol- legiates. At the 1973 Women's Nationals, Princeton finished third behind Arizona State and Florida as Cathy Corcione '74 set national records in the 100-yard freestyle and 100-yard butterfly, while joining Captain Carol Brown '75, Barbara Franks '76, and Jane Fremon '75 to set a national record in the 200-yard freestyle relay. That same year, the other pioneer, Cece Herron '74, was both the 1-meter and 3-meter diving champion at the 1973 Easterns. The following year at the 1974 Easterns, Cathy Corcione set another national record\u2014in the 100- yard individual medley\u2014and Eastern records in four other events. Led by Captain Liz Osborne '76, who took first in the 50-, 100-, and 200-yard breaststroke, Princeton placed second in the 1976 Eastern In- tercollegiates. The following year, paced by Mary Sykes '79 and Beth Mauer '80, the Princeton team deci\u00ad sively outpointed Yale, 657 to 520, to win the first official women's Ivy cham\u00ad pionship. Coached initially by the men's var\u00ad sity coach, Bill Farley, the women's team has had its own full-time coach, since the fall of 1975. Dave Garretson '72 was coach until the fall of 1977, when he was succeeded by Jane Bark- man Tyler, former American record holder and Olympic medalist. Her 1978 team took second place in both the Ivy and Eastern championships. Beth Mauer '80 set four Princeton records in the backstroke, butterfly, and the 200- and 400-yard individual medley. Tarkington, [Newton] Booth (1869- 1946), novelist and playwright, spent his first two years of college at Purdue, HUGH STOTT TAYLOR 461 his last two at Princeton. He was a found- der of the Triangle Club, and editor of the Nassau Literary Magazine, a con\u00ad tributor of humorous drawings and literary wit to The Tiger, and the most popular man in his class. Bliss Perry said he was \"the only Princeton man who had ever been known to play poker (with his left hand), write a story for the Nassau Lit (with his right hand), and lead the singing in a crowded room, performing these three acts simulta\u00ad neously.\" These pleasurable activities Tarkington carried on at some expense to his studies, and when his class graduated in 1893 he lacked sufficient credits for a degree. His later achieve\u00ad ments, however, won him an honorary A.M. in 1899 and an honorary Litt.D. in 1918. Tarkington's singing of Kipling's bal\u00ad lad, \"The Hanging of Danny Deever\" was a highlight of student life in his time. Sooner or later, when the seniors gathered on the steps of Nassau Hall for their singing, the call would go up \"Tark! Tark! Danny Deever!\" and al\u00ad though he would always protest and suggest another song\u2014and sometimes even try to slink away\u2014his classmates would call for him until he had per\u00ad formed. In later years at class reunions the cry continued, and as one of his classmates related in the Alumni Weekly, Tarkington continued to re\u00ad spond reluctantly: The same old Tark\u2014just watch him shy Like hunted thing, and hide, if let, Away behind his cigarette When \"Danny Deever!\" is the cry. Keep up the call and, by and by We'll make him sing, and find he's yet The same old Tark. Tarkington wrote a series of cheerful, realistic novels about life in the Middle West, beginning with The Gentleman from Indiana (1899) and including two Pulitzer Prize winners, The Magnifi\u00ad cent Ambersons (1918) and Alice Adams (1921). He also, as Dean West said in presenting him for his second honorary degree, \"rediscovered the American boy and wrote the idyll of his life\" in Penrod (1914) and its sequels. He dramatized several of his novels, wrote other plays, short stories, essays, and The World Does Move (1928), a book of reminiscences. In a commemorative tribute to Tar\u00ad kington written for the American Academy of Arts and Letters Professor Chauncey B. Tinker of Yale quoted this remark of the critic, Hamilton Basso: In his books as nowhere else, we get an understanding of how that earlier, more stable world of clipped lawns, gabled houses, and long summer holidays seemed from the inside of those who, like Tarkington himself, looked upon it as the best of all pos\u00ad sible environments in a none too per\u00ad fect world. \"In that happy environment,\" Tinker added, \"he had many blessings. Expe\u00ad rience of a sadly different kind in later life he bore with fortitude, and re\u00ad mained undefeated to the end. He was a gallant gentleman.\" Taylor, Hugh Stott (1890-1974), who was born in Lancashire, England, and educated at the University of Liver\u00ad pool, came to Princeton in 1914 expect\u00ad ing to remain only a few years. He stayed the rest of his long and produc\u00ad tive life. Starting as a chemistry instruc\u00ad tor, he rose quickly to full professor at age thirty-two and became first David B. Jones Professor in 1927. He served as chairman of the Department of Chemistry for twenty-five years and was dean of the graduate school from 1945 until his retirement in 1958. 462 TEACHER PREPARATION Refore receiving his doctorate at Liverpool, Taylor had done research in physical chemistry at the Nobel Insti\u00ad tute in Stockholm and at the Technische Hochshule in Hanover. He soon became known for his work in this field and in 1919 gained international recognition when he wrote with Sir Eric Rideal the first significant book on catalysis. He was frequently consulted by both government and industry. Dur\u00ad ing the First World War he returned to England to work in the Munitions In\u00ad ventions Department. In the Second World War he played a prominent role in American scientific effort, directing a number of research projects, and con\u00ad tributing to the development of the atomic bomb with his discovery of the most effective catalyst for producing heavy water. As an authority on catalysis, Taylor attracted to the University able young scientists from all over the world, among them future leaders in America, England, Japan, Belgium, and Sweden. While chairman of the department from 1926 to 1951, he was influential in securing Frick Chemical Laboratory and vigorously led the way in the de\u00ad velopment of chemistry at Princeton. His enthusiasm kept the department alive with excitement, which affected the work not only of postdoctoral fel\u00ad lows but of undergraduate students. While he was dean, the Graduate School trebled its enrollment, added nine Ph.D. programs (in five engineer\u00ad ing departments and in architecture, music, religion, and sociology), and strengthened its ties with former stu\u00ad dents through the creation of the Asso\u00ad ciation of Princeton Graduate Alumni. As devoted a churchman as he was a scientist and educator, Taylor was largely responsible for the establish\u00ad ment of a Catholic chaplaincy at Princeton in 1928, and he spoke fre\u00adquently on the Campus about the rela\u00ad tion of science and religion. He held to Thomas Aquinas's thesis that \"Science is a revelation of the mind of God,\" and insisted, as in a Princetonian article in 1939, that true education could not be \"divorced from the spiritual values of life.\" He was president of Pax Romana, the international Roman Catholic movement for intellectual and cultural affairs, and a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. His achievements brought him many honors. He was awarded the Nichols Medal of the American Chemical Soci\u00ad ety in 1928, elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1932, and made a Commander of the Belgian Order of Leopold II in 1937. The ensu\u00ad ing years brought him other medals, numerous honorary degrees, and membership in many American and foreign academies and societies. He was notably honored in 1953, when in April he presided over the Faraday So\u00ad ciety's golden jubilee celebration in London, and when the following month he was twice knighted, first by Pope Pius XII in the Order of St. Gregory the Great, and, five days later, by Queen Elizabeth in the Order of the British Empire. After his retirement, he served as president of the Woodrow Wilson Na\u00ad tional Fellowship Foundation and as editor-in-chief of American Scientist, the periodical publication of the Society of Sigma Xi, of which he had been pres\u00ad ident. In 1962 an anonymous donor pro\u00ad vided an enduring memorial of Sir Hugh's lifelong contribution to Princeton with a $500,000 gift estab\u00ad lishing the Hugh Stott Taylor Chair of Chemistry. Teacher preparation, as part of the undergraduate curriculum, was initi-TENNIS 463 ated in 1965, when President Goheen appointed a faculty committee to de\u00ad velop a program appropriate to a liberal arts college. The members were Pro\u00ad fessors William M. Beaney, chairman, Jeremiah S. Finch, Heinrich D. Hol\u00ad land, Sheldon Judson, Andre Maman, Albert H. Marckwardt, James W. Smith, and Albert W. Tucker. The committee's recommendations were based on the belief that a broad under\u00ad graduate program with concentration in one subject, combined with adequate experience as a student teacher under competent supervision, would prepare a person to teach that subject at the secondary school level. The Teacher Preparation Program was approved by the faculty in 1967 and begun in that year under the direction of Henry Callard, former headmaster of the Gilman School, who had guided the proposal through its presentation to the faculty. He was joined in 1968 by Henry Drewry, former chairman of so\u00ad cial studies at the Princeton High School, who became director following Callard's retirement. In 1969 the pro\u00ad gram was approved by the New Jersey Department of Education, and the first graduating senior received a perma\u00ad nent certificate for secondary school teaching. For many years students had gone out from Princeton to enter the teach\u00ad ing profession, most of them in inde\u00ad pendent schools; lack of certification was an impediment for those who wished to become public school teachers. The advent of the program made certification possible on gradua\u00ad tion, thus extending the possibilities for service to public as well as to private schools. As the program has evolved, it has adhered to the basic ideas of the original proposal: completion of full de\u00ad partmental requirements, selection of elective courses important to prospec\u00adtive teachers, and extended classroom experience of directed observation and teaching with competent counsel and instruction. Certification is possible in English, foreign languages, mathe\u00ad matics, science, and social studies. By 1976 nearly 300 had completed the program and received certification, more than half of whom had gone di\u00ad rectly into teaching. Besides achieving the purpose for which it was founded, the program has provided an added benefit for its partic\u00ad ipants. Orderly consideration of the teaching process and of the organiza\u00ad tion of ideas and materials to assist others to learn can enhance one's abil\u00ad ity to view and evaluate one's own edu\u00ad cation. Thus the Teacher Preparation Program is not only consonant with a liberal education but supports and strengthens it for a significant part of each undergraduate class. Henry S. Drewry Jeremiah S. Finch Tennis, long the most popular game played at Princeton, began as an organ\u00ad ized sport in 1882 when under\u00ad graduates formed the Princeton Lawn Tennis Association. Two years later, Princeton joined the newly founded In\u00ad tercollegiate Lawn Tennis Association and by the turn of the century had pro\u00ad duced three intercollegiate champions: Samuel G. Thomson 1898, Raymond D. Little 01, and Frederick B. Alexan\u00ad der 02. Little and Alexander also shared Princeton's first doubles cham\u00ad pionship in 1900. Led by Dean Mathey 12 and George M. Church 15, Princeton teams ex\u00ad celled in the years 1910 through 1915. Mathey twice shared intercollegiate doubles championships\u2014in 1910, with his classmate Burnham N. Dell; and in 464 TENNIS 1911, with another classmate Charles T. Butler. Singles champion in both 1912 and 1914, Church also won the doubles in 1912 with his classmate Winfred H. Mace. Church later gave the University ten tennis courts, while Mathey, for many years a charter trus\u00ad tee, and Joseph L. Werner '21, a former tennis captain, gave the pavilion in the center of the tennis courts on Brokaw Field. Princeton had one undefeated team in the first decade of the century (1906), two in the second (1913 and 1915), and five in the third (1921, 1922, 1926, 1928, 1929). Princeton's most re\u00ad nowned player John Van Ryn, Jr. '28 and his roommate Kenneth B. Appel '29 were intercollegiate doubles cham\u00ad pions in 1927. Van Ryn, who was noted for his superb low volleying, later teamed with Wilmer L. Allison (Uni\u00ad versity of Texas) to win the Wimbledon doubles championship in 1929 and 1930 and the United States doubles in 1931 and 1935\u2014a partnership honored in 1963 by their joint election to the Na\u00ad tional Lawn Tennis Hall of Fame. Under Mercer Beasley, who became coach in 1933, Princeton completed three undefeated seasons in 1933, 1934, and 1938, won Eastern intercol\u00ad legiate championships in 1933, 1938, and 1941, and produced the 1935 East\u00ad ern intercollegiate singles champion \u2014Norcross S. Tilney '35. Assistant Coach John Conroy took over as head coach in 1942. During his thirty-year tenure, he directed eight undefeated teams, one in 1942, three from 1950 through 1952, and four from 1961 through 1964. Princeton won the Eastern intercollegiate championship in each of these years, as well as in 1953, 1957, and 1971, and shared it in 1954, 1965, 1968, and 1969. Two of Conroy's teams gained national recog\u00adnition: the 1942 team was ranked Number 1, the 1951 team Number 2. In the five years from 1949 to 1953, his teams won 42 consecutive victories\u2014an all-time, all-sport Princeton record which stood only until six more Conroy teams accumulated 54 consecutive vic\u00ad tories from 1960 to 1965. Princeton players of this period won the Eastern intercollegiate doubles championship four times: Edgar M. Buttenheim '44 and Richard J. Bender '44 in 1942, Chadwick Johnson '46 and Frederick C. Prior '47 in 1944, John C. Taylor '48 and Joseph D. Scheerer '48 in 1945, and James S. Farrin '58 and David O. Brechner '59 in 1957. Two of them were singles champions: Chad\u00ad wick Johnson in 1944, James Farrin in 1956 and 1957. Another outstanding player in the Conroy years was Herbert Fitzgibbon II '64, who played number one on all three undefeated teams in 1962, 1963, and 1964. Conroy retired as tennis coach at the end of the 1971 season with a Princeton career winning average of. 877. Freshman coach William M. Sum\u00ad mers took over the varsity coaching duties in 1971 and was succeeded in the fall of 1974 by David Benjamin, who had been captain of Harvard's 1966 Ivy League championship tennis team. Princeton teams continued in the Con\u00ad roy tradition, finishing first for four consecutive years: they took the East\u00ad ern intercollegiate championship out\u00ad right in 1974 and 1975, shared it with Harvard in 1976, and won it outright again in 1977. WOMEN'S TENNIS First organized in 1970, women's tennis teams proved to be equally for\u00ad midable, taking the Eastern intercol\u00ad legiate women's championship the first five years and sustaining a 35-match THEATRE INTIME 465 winning streak from 1971 through 1975. Marjory Gengler '73, the first Princeton woman to be awarded the white sweater with black P traditionally given captains of championship teams, was also Princeton's first winner of the Eastern intercollegiate women's singles championship, in the fall of 1970. Her classmate Jane Kincaid took the same title in both succeeding years, and in 1975, Linda Rice '78 became Prince\u00ad ton's fourth Eastern women's singles champion in six years. In doubles, Susan Epstein '76 and Julie Kirkham '76 won the Eastern champion\u00ad ship in 1972. Eve Kraft coached the women until 1973 when she re\u00ad signed to devote full time to the Princeton Community Tennis Pro\u00ad gram, in which she was co-director with John Conroy. Her successors have been Anne Marie Hicks, Carla Geiser, and Marie McCallum. Theatre Intime, born for the self- amusement of three juniors on the third floor of Witherspoon Hall in 1919-20, has produced over 500 plays and involved some 10,000 people. It has always been run entirely by stu\u00ad dents, independent of University supervision. The experience gained in being responsible for every aspect of running a theatre is often cited as the reason for the unusual number of In\u00ad time graduates who have had outstand\u00ad ing careers in the professional theatre. In 1921, Theatre Intime moved into Murray-Dodge under the leadership of Louis Laflin '24 and became a \"legiti\u00ad mate\" campus organization. The em\u00ad phasis at first was on serious and/or original plays. (Some 150 student- written plays have been put on. Of \"classical\" authors, Shakespeare leads with 18 different plays produced, fol\u00adlowed by Shaw with 16 and O'Neill with 8.) A fire in June 1933 gutted the inte\u00ad rior of Murray Theatre. It was remod\u00ad eled that summer into roughly its pres\u00ad ent shape. World War II posed a more serious crisis. After three years in which Murray was given over to Navy lectures, a group of former Triangle and Intime members re-established the or\u00ad ganization, reaching heights in 1948 with a memorable production of \"Richard II.\" Their momentum carried over into the formation of the summer University Players. This was nothing new, for some of Intime's leading spirits had helped found the original University Players at Falmouth, Mas\u00ad sachusetts, in 1928. A third outcrop\u00ad ping of talent in 1968 brought to life \"Summer Intime,\" which at this writ\u00ad ing is still going strong. Some Intime \"stars\" who have spar\u00ad kled in professional theatre are Bre- taigne Windust and Erik Barnouw '29; Joshua Logan, Norris Houghton, and Myron McCormick '31; Robert Chap\u00ad man '41; Philip Minor '50; Charles Schultz, Hugh Hardy and Daniel zer '54; McCarter Theatre in 1931); \"Time of Their Lives\" (a play about Princeton by Robert Nail '33); \"The Great God Brown\" (1936), which earned a telegram of congratulation from Eugene O'Neill; and Giraudoux' \"The Trojan War Will Not Take Place\" in the early 1950s. For over half a cen\u00ad tury Intime has steered a generally suc\u00ad cessful course between the demands of the box office and the desire to do seldom-produced plays. Herbert McAneny 466 THE THIRD WORLD CENTER Third World Center, The, was created in 1971 when the trustees approved the designation of the old Osborn Field House as a University facility to be used primarily, but not exclusively, by minority students. Because the University's cultural and social organizations have largely been shaped by students from families nur\u00ad tured in the Anglo-American and European traditions, it has not always been easy for students from different backgrounds to enter the mainstream of campus life. As trustee John M. Doar pointed out to the Board of Trustees, students from minority groups may miss something in their educational experience\u2014not owing to a failure on the part of the University, but rather because the situation in which they find themselves is often different from the circumstances to which they have been accustomed. Minority students thus felt uneasiness and in many instances a sense of insecurity. In 1971 the University began to re\u00ad cruit actively students who, while qual\u00ad ified, had not been a substantial part of the community. It was then believed and has since been established that in\u00ad creased participation of students from various backgrounds would stimulate and enrich the intellectual and cultural life of the University. With the in\u00ad creased enrollment of minority students in the early 1970s, Princeton had to give particular attention to ways in which these students could come to\u00ad gether on an intellectual and cultural basis, to help them appreciate better their own backgrounds and to enhance their self-confidence. The University also recognized the need to have a means whereby the rest of the Univer\u00ad sity community could better under\u00ad stand and appreciate the backgrounds and views of minority students. During the academic year 1970-71, leaders of various minority groups ex\u00ad pressed a strong interest in a facility for activities of their own that would in\u00ad clude seminars, colloquia, exhibits, cul\u00ad tural shows, and social events. After a proposal had been carefully worked out and subjected to the most searching re\u00ad view, such a center was opened in the fall of 1971. As with other University- sponsored collegiate facilities, the Third World Center is open to all stu\u00ad dents. Its academic and cultural pro\u00ad gram is shaped by the students, the Master, and a Program Director. The Center is not residential and does not normally serve meals. Its aim is to pro\u00ad vide through intellectual and social ac\u00ad tivities a setting and a program that will help students to reinforce each other and also to create a forum for greater awareness and understanding among people of differing cultural back\u00ad grounds. In doing so, the Third World Center has become a vital part of the University's cultural life and a resource for the whole University community. Conrad D. Snowden Thomas, Norman [Mattoon] 1884- 1968), six times Socialist candidate for president of the United States, 1928 through 1948, began what he called a lifelong \"love affair with Old Nassau\" when, as a \"gangling lad\" in Marion, Ohio, a family friend gave him a copy of Jesse Lynch Williams's Princeton Stories. After a year at Bucknell, Thomas was admitted to Princeton in the fall of 1902 as a \"heavily conditioned\" sophomore, thus becoming \"a member of the glori\u00ad ous Class of 1905.\" He passed off his conditions, qualified for the \"first gen\u00ad eral group\" all three years, and was chosen class valedictorian at gradua-NORMAN THOMAS 467 tion. He did not think the education he received first-rate; \"the curriculum . . . should have set higher, more demand\u00ad ing goals,\" and there were not enough good teachers\u2014Wilson's preceptorial system was not to begin until the year after his graduation. He thought his lecturers good, particularly Professors Daniels and WyckoflF in economics. To Mr. Daniels he owed \"a sound ground\u00ad ing in a laissez faire economy\" so that later in life he \"knew what he was re\u00ad jecting.\" He also thought \"Weary Wil\u00ad lie Walter WyckoflF did a pretty good if by no means lasting job\" in teaching him \"why socialism would never work.\" He was enthusiastic about the honor system in examinations (\"a major con\u00ad tribution to any man's education\"). He excelled in Whig Hall activities, especially in competitive debate. He remembered a formal debate in Alex\u00ad ander Hall at which President Wilson presided, when all the participants wore academic gowns. \"Just as we were about to go in,\" he recalled, \"Mr. Wil\u00ad son looked at my legs and where the gown stopped observed my gray trousers\u2014they were pressed\u2014and said, 'Mr. Thomas, it is proper to wear dark trousers.' In spite of that I won the debate.\" At graduation, the 1905 Nassau Herald revealed, he regarded himself as a Presbyterian and a Republican, was called \"Tommy\" by his classmates, and intended to become a minister (like his father and his grandfather). The first two years after graduation he worked at Spring Street Church and Neigh\u00ad borhood House in New York City; he told his class secretary that he had come to see that \"as a nation we face a social problem of tremendous gravity, whose solution will take the best that we have in us of thought and service.\" For 1905's Five-Year Record, Tommy began his report: \"Bliss has no history. This letter will be brief.\" He had just been married to Frances Violet Stewart (granddaughter of John Aikman Stewart, financial adviser to President Lincoln and to President Cleveland, and a trustee of Princeton for many years), whom he had met at a tuber\u00ad culosis clinic where she was a social worker. They were living in an apart\u00ad ment in a crowded tenement district where he was doing social work for Christ Church while attending Union Theological Seminary, and where all 1905 men would be welcome. He ended his letter: \"With sincere sym\u00ad pathy for all the unmarried.\" In the Twenty-Year Record in 1925 Thomas reported that he was now executive director of the League for In\u00ad dustrial Democracy. He had been a parish minister in East Harlem, an editor of three publications, and an \"ad\u00ad vocate of unpopular causes.\" \"My path has led me away from the road travelled by many old friends,\" he wrote. \"That I regret, but nothing else.\" Thomas later recalled that he had been barred as a speaker from the Princeton campus from 1917 to 1924 but that to his \"pleased surprise\" he was given an honorary degree in 1932. It was President Hibben (an ardent in\u00ad terventionist in World War I) who barred him from the campus, and it was Hibben also who persuaded the trus\u00ad tees to give Thomas the degree at Hib- ben's last Commencement. The conferring of his degree, which was to have occupied an unobtrusive position third from the end, involved a minor mishap. The University Orator, Dean Augustus Trowbridge, completed the presentation of honorary graduands without any mention of Thomas, con\u00ad cluding in a resonant voice: \"And finally, Mr. President, for the degree of Doctor 468 NORMAN THOMAS of Laws, honoris causa, Benjamin Nathan Cardoza. ...\" Justice Cardoza's degree conferred, the University Orator started to return to his seat. The Chief Marshal, Secretary V. Lansing Collins, caught him by the sleeve and whis\u00ad pered in his ear. The orator wheeled back into position, riffled through his papers, and announced, \"And finally, Mr. President, I have the honor to present for the degree of Doctor of Let\u00ad ters, honoris causa, Norman Thomas.\" After the to Thomas that the sheet con\u00ad taining his citation had got attached to the preceding sheet by a paper clip. \"I know,\" said Thomas, \"a capitalistic clip.\" Trowbridge's citation \"a brilliant and successful clergyman . . . who for conscience's sake gave up a conventional form of ministry . . . to become the fearless and upright advo\u00ad cate of change in the social order.\" \"Ir\u00ad respective of party preferences,\" Trowbridge concluded, \"we join to honor this valiant and distinguished son of Princeton.\" Thomas gave \"critical support\" to American participation in World War II because he feared an Axis victory would condemn the world to the \"lowest cir\u00ad cle of hell.\" But when the United States used the atomic bomb against Japan, he cried out in protest. In 1955 the editors of 1905's half- century record said Tommy was be\u00ad loved by all his classmates and no 1905 gathering was complete without his presence and some utterance from his \"silver tongue.\" All of them, the editors said\u2014\"even those in violent dissent\" \u2014agreed that he was \"a man of the highest integrity, of utter, self-efface\u00ad ment [and] concern for the welfare of his fellow men, and of kindliness rarely seen in . . . iconoclasts.\" Thomas, for his part, failed\u2014doubtless to your gen\u00ad eral satisfaction!\u2014in the chief pur\u00ad pose of my career. That was to bring about, or help bring about, in our country a more realistic political alignment which might give us two major responsible parties, one of them democratic socialist in princi\u00ad ple whatever its name. None of us at Princeton in 1905 could possibly have dreamed what this half-century has brought forth. But I suspect that in years of war and turmoil, among our comforts has been satisfaction that Princeton and the things it stands for has endured. Often we have warmed our hearts at the flame of our Princeton loyalties. And Princeton's beauty, present before our eyes or in memory, has been like Princeton's friendships, an abiding joy, a part of life's wealth that cannot be taken away. In his later years Thomas was almost sightless, hard of hearing, and crippled by arthritis, but he maintained his keen interest in people and affairs until the every end. Interviewed by long dis\u00ad tance telephone on his eighty-first birthday, while listening by radio to the Princeton-Dartmouth football game, he told a reporter: \"I like human beings. I'm very glad I'm one of them. But I think we're crazy.\" In a speech to students from thirty countries just before his eighty-third birthday, delivered according to one reporter \"at 200 words a minute,\" he castigated the United States for its policies in Vietnam and its inadequate antipoverty efforts, but he insisted nevertheless that he had affection for his country as well as criticism. He didn't like the sight of young people burning the American flag. \"A sym\u00ad bol?\" he asked, \"if they want an appro\u00ad priate symbol they should be washing THOMPSON GATEWAY 469 the flag, not burning it.\" He thought loyalties necessary in life. \"Most of us live by our group loyalties . . . but we have to rise above them to the values of humanity so that we can co-exist lest we don't exist at all.\" He died in his sleep soon after his eighty-fourth birthday. In the Alumni Weekly the secretary of 1905 reminded his forty-five surviving classmates that in senior year they had voted Tommy the brightest man in the class. \"If we could have foreseen the future,\" the secretary added, \"we must also have acclaimed him the most courageous.\" Thompson, Henry Burling 1877 (1857-1935) probably had more to do with the physical appearance of Princeton during the period of unprec\u00ad edented expansion in the Wilson and Hibben administrations than any other man. A textile manufacturer in Wil\u00ad mington and president of the board of trustees of the University of Delaware, he was a Princeton trustee for almost thirty years. Thompson was chairman of the trus\u00ad tees' committee on grounds and build\u00ad ings from 1909 to 1928. He early saw the need for the formulation of a master plan for the development of the Cam\u00ad pus; he proposed the creation of the offices of supervising architect and con\u00ad sulting landscape gardener, and was influential in bringing Ralph Adams Cram and Beatrix Farrand to Princeton to fill these positions. During his chairmanship, twenty-five campus buildings were erected, beginning with Holder Hall and ending with the Uni\u00ad versity Chapel. A friend of Woodrow Wilson since their college days, Thompson sup\u00ad ported Wilson's quad plan and graduate college proposals, but when these were defeated and Wilson left to enter poli\u00ad tics, he gave the same loyal support to John Grier Hibben. \"He never hesi\u00ad tates, he never draws back,\" President Hibben told Thompson's classmates, \"and when he once puts his mind and spirit to any enterprise for the sake of Princeton, its successful accomplish\u00ad ment is assured.\" Thompson headed the 1919 drive that raised $10 million in new endow\u00ad ment and helped found the School of Engineering in 1921. He was chairman of a trustees' committee that drew up the University's basic plan of physical education and encouraged the devel\u00ad opment of a greatly expanded number of tennis courts and playing fields near the dormitories. He spoke out against undue emphasis on gate receipts in in\u00ad tercollegiate athletics and pushed the idea of \"athletics for all.\" He had a spe\u00ad cial (and partisan) interest in rowing\u2014 he was chairman of the alumni rowing committee for ten years\u2014and every spring the editor of the Alumni Weekly confidently awaited Thompson's annual letter asking why crew was not given more space. Thompson is commemorated by a memorial court, created in 1956 with a gift from his family, at the center of the walk that passes through the arches of East Pyne Building, on the site of East College, where he roomed as an un\u00ad dergraduate. Thompson Gateway and the adjacent brick wall on Prospect Avenue near Olden Avenue were given in 1911 by Ferris S. Thompson 1888. Until the early 1960s when the Engineering Quadrangle was built, the wall marked the southern boundary of the athletic grounds known as University Field, and the gate was opened annually to admit the alumni parade to the baseball game with Yale on Reunion Saturday. The gateway and wall were designed by McKim, Mead, and White, who also 470 THE TIGER designed the FitzRandolph Gateway (q.v.) in front of Nassau Hall. Ferris Thompson was the grandson of the founder of the Chase National Bank in New York. As an under\u00ad graduate he held the Princeton record for the mile walk and was president of the Princeton Athletic Association in his senior year. On his death in 1913, he left the University $3 million, a third by im\u00ad mediate bequest, the balance in his re\u00ad siduary estate which came to the Uni\u00ad versity in 1948. His gifts were used for general endowment, for Bicentennial Preceptorships, and for the Ferris S. Thompson faculty houses on College Road. Tiger, The, emerged as a symbol of Princeton, ironically, not very long after Woodrow Wilson's class, at its graduation in 1879, gave the College a pair of lions to guard the main entrance to Nassau Hall. The growing use of the tiger\u2014rather than the lion\u2014as Prince\u00ad ton's totem has been ascribed by Prince- tonians of that period to two things: the college cheer, which, like other cheers of that time, contained a \"tiger\" as a ral\u00ad lying word; and the growing use of orange and black as the college colors. In 1882 the senior class issued a humor magazine called The Princeton Tiger, depicting on its title page a lively tiger cub being born beneath the legend Volume I, Number 1. This tiger's influence was short-lived, how\u00ad ever, since after only nine issues no other issue appeared until 1890 when another generation brought forth a sec\u00ad ond Volume I, Number 1. Meanwhile, football players of the early 1880s were wearing broad orange and black stripes on their stockings and on their jerseys, and sometimes on stocking caps. Watching their movements in the wan\u00ading light of late autumn afternoons, sports writers began to call them tigers. The tiger soon began to appear in Princeton songs, begining with \"The Orange and the Black,\" written in the late 1880s by Clarence Mitchell 1889: Although Yale has always favored The violet's dark hue, And the many sons of Harvard To the crimson rose are true, We will own the lilies slender, Nor honor shall they lack, While the tiger stands defender Of the Orange and the Black. A few years later, Ernest Carter 1888's lovely \"Steps Song\" began, de\u00ad spite the awkward presence of Sev\u00ad enty-Nine's lions: Our lofty elms so gently break The twilight crescent moon's soft light; Old Nassau's tigers slow awake; The Seniors hold the steps tonight. In 1905 Kenneth S. Clark '05 com\u00ad posed a song about a Princeton tiger \"who will eat right off your hand.\" \"But,\" he warned, \"when he gets in battle with the other beasts of prey, he frightens them almost to death in this peculiar way\": Wow, wow, wow-wow-wow Hear the Tiger roar; Wow, wow, wow-wow-wow, Rolling up a score. Wow, wow, wow-wow-wow, Better move along When you hear the Tiger sing his jungle song. In 1893, a three-year old eating club called The Inn changed its name to Tiger Inn. In 1902, a pair of marble tigers, holding shields, appeared on the posts of the gateway north of Little Hall; JOHN TORREY 471 another pair appeared on the north wall of McCosh Hall when it was built in 1907. In 1911, with the tiger firmly estab\u00ad lished as the Princeton symbol, the Class of 1879 substituted A. P. Proctor's bronze tigers for the lions flanking the front steps of Nassau Hall. That same year, carved marble tigers looked down from the tops of the pillars flanking the newly constructed Ferris Thompson Gateway at University Field, as many small tigers worked their way into the wrought iron gates below. Thanks to the infinite variety possi\u00ad ble in Gothic decoration, the tiger con\u00ad tinued to put in an appearance in dif\u00ad ferent places and in various ways: as brass weathervanes on top of Holder and Henry towers; on mouldings of 1879 Hall and Dillon Gym; above a fireplace at the west end of Procter Hall at the Graduate College, where, if one looks carefully, he can discern a tiger peering out from the foliage carved in the stone. All these tigers were undoubtedly conceived of as male. In 1969, the year coeducation was introduced, Bruce Moore's bronze tigers for the Adams Mall between Whig and Clio were created male and female. In 1923, a live tiger who had been captured in India by the father of a football player, Albert F. Howard '25, was brought to Princeton as a mascot; but after several weeks of mounting community anxiety he was given to a zoo. Since World War II a less ferocious and more convivial tiger\u2014an under\u00ad graduate clad in a tiger skin\u2014has ap\u00ad peared regularly at football games, cavorting with the cheerleaders and the band, and delighting young and old alike. At the 1973 Yale game this friendly tiger was accompanied, for the first time, by a comely tigress, a large orange bow on her mane and a smaller one on her tail. Torrey, John (1796-1873), pioneer American botanist, was professor of chemistry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York from 1827 to 1855 and concurrently professor of chemistry and natural history at Princeton from 1830 to 1854. Although obliged to devote much of his time to his duties as a teacher, mainly of chemistry, and after 1854 as United States Assayer of the Mint at New York, Torrey was able to carry on his interest in botany and to establish himself as a foremost American bota\u00ad nist. His pioneering work in the identi\u00ad fication and classification of American plants greatly influenced all subsequent taxonomic work. He wrote Flora of the State of New York and, with the collab\u00ad oration of his pupil and friend, Asa Gray, compiled their great work, Flora of North America. Torrey tried to secure an appoint\u00ad ment for Gray at Princeton. \"Asa Gray has no superior in botany,\" he wrote to Joseph Henry, \". . . It is good policy for the College to secure the services & af\u00ad fections of young men of talent, & let them grow up with the Institution.\" But the requisite funds were not avail\u00ad able. Torrey's own appointment had been part of an ingenious series of faculty recruitments Vice President Maclean had earlier contrived with meagre resources. Later, Gray was called to Harvard as the first Fisher Professor of Natural History and devel\u00ad oped there a distinguished department of botany. Torrey had a genial and unselfish character, and was the friend and helper of every young American 472 TRACK AND FIELD botanist of his time. \"As an inves\u00ad tigator,\" Gray wrote in a memoir for the National Academy of Sciences, which he and Torrey helped found, \"he was characterized by a scrupulous accu\u00ad racy, a remarkable fertility of mind, es\u00ad pecially shown in devising ways and means of research, and perhaps by some excess of caution.\" A mountain peak in Colorado was named for Torrey by a former student. Torrey climbed this peak for the first time when he was seventy-six, and there gathered alpine plants which he had himself named fifty years before when botanical study of the Colorado Rocky Mountains was first begun. Also named for him was a genus of evergreen trees, Torreya, somewhat like the yew. All over the world, Gray concluded in his memoir, Torreya trees, as well as his own important con\u00ad tributions to botany, keep John Tor- rey's memory green. Track and field athletics had their be\u00ad ginning at Princeton in an intramural meet on June 21, 1873\u2014the first col\u00ad legiate track contest held in the United States. The meet was organized by George Goldie, Scottish-born director of the gymnasium from 1869 to 1911, and called the Caledonian Games be\u00ad cause of his success as an all-round champion in games staged by American and Canadian Caledonian Clubs. The names of some of the events reflected their Caledonian origin\u2014standing long jump, running high leap, hitch and kick, vaulting with the pole. The Cale\u00ad donian Games survived until 1947; thereafter they gave way to the fuller intercollegiate schedule of modern times. In the first Caledonian Games Allan Marquand 1874, later the founder of the college's art department, won three first places and one second. In the fourth Caledonian Games Andrew J. McCosh 1877 won four first places, one second. Introducing him to a friend about this time, President McCosh re\u00ad marked, \"This is my son, Andrew, whose brains are in his heels.\" This was fatherly hyperbole: Andrew graduated with honors and became an eminent surgeon. In 1876, at the first meet held by the newly formed Intercollegiate Associa\u00ad tion of Amateur Athletes of America (the IC4A), Princeton won the team championship with four first places and four seconds. Francis Larkin, Jr. 1879 won inter\u00ad collegiate championships in the shot- put, hammer throw, standing high junp, and standing broad jump in both 1878 and 1879. He was the first four- event winner in the country and the only one in Princeton history. Walter C. Dohm 1890, double win\u00ad ner in 1890 of the half-mile and the broad jump, was the first intercolle\u00ad giate champion to do the half-mile under 2 minutes. A double winner in 1891, Luther H. Cary 1893 was the first American sprinter to use the crouching start, and the first intercollegiate champion to do the 100 in 10 seconds flat and the 220 under 22 seconds. Robert Garrett 1897, twice team cap\u00ad tain, earned an unequalled place of honor on the roll of Princeton Olym\u00ad pians (q.v.) as the winner of two first places, a second, and a third at the first of the modern Olympic games in 1896. Princeton's outstanding track athlete of the nineteenth century was John F. Cregan 1899. Twice team captain and three times intercollegiate champion in the mile, he won both the half-mile and the mile in the 1898 intercollegiates, the first runner in the country to ac\u00ad complish this feat. A year later, he won TRACK AND FIELD 473 the first intercollegiate cross-country championship, and at the 1900 Penn Relays, he was anchor man on the Princeton team which won the two- mile relay championship and set a new intercollegiate record (8:05). In a meet with California, he won the quarter- mile as well as the mile; and against Cornell he took first place in the half- mile, the mile, and the two-mile runs. (In later life a metallurgist, he lived to be 88.) John R. DeWitt 04 was intercol\u00ad legiate hammer-throw champion four straight years from 1901 through 1904\u2014Princeton's only four-time win\u00ad ner in the intercollegiates. In the words of a Harvard contemporary, he was \"a giant in strength and a master of the art of the double turn.\" Princeton's first dual meet was with Columbia in 1877, but regular annual meets did not begin until the 1890s, first with Columbia, later with Cornell, Yale, Harvard. Following Goldie, other trainers who worked with the varsity track squad were James Robinson, Jack McMasters, Walter Christie, Alfred F. Copland, Charles H. Wilson. THE FITZPATRICK ERA Keene Fitzpatrick, the leading track coach in the country, was called to Princeton from the University of Michigan in 1910. His 1911 team was the first Princeton team to beat Yale in a dual meet. The victory was not as\u00ad sured until the last event, the high jump, in which a sophomore, John F. Simmons '13, later chief of protocol of the State Department, \"rose to the oc\u00ad casion,\" as the Alumni Weekly put it, and tied for first place, giving Princeton a 60-56 edge over Yale. In 1915, a Princeton team won the two-mile relay championship at the Penn Relays, setting a new intercollegiate record (7:55.4), and the anchor man, Captain Ian Douglas Mackenzie '15, set a new Princeton record for the mile (4:20) in the Yale-Princeton meet that year. Fitzpatrick's most brilliant years were those after World War I when five teams beat both Yale and Harvard in 1918, 1920, 1922, 1925, and 1932, and four placed second in the Intercol\u00ad legiates in 1920, 1922, 1923, and 1925. In 1932, his last team, captained by Hunter P. Dawson '32, won its three dual meets with Cornell, Harvard, and Yale, and was, he said, the best- balanced team he had ever coached. Fifteen Princetonians trained by Keene Fitzpatrick won individual inter\u00ad collegiate championships. Two of them were double winners: Charles R. Erdman '19 in the 120-yard high hur\u00ad dles and 220-yard low hurdles in 1918; Randolph E. Brown '20 in the 100- and 220-yard dashes in 1920. Two were two-time winners, J. Coard Taylor '23 in the 220-yard low hurdles in 1922 and 1923; Ralph G. Hills '25 in the shot-put in 1923 and 1925. Each also won a na\u00ad tional championship, Taylor in 1922, Hills in 1925. The most versatile trackman of this era was S. Harrison Thomson '23, na\u00ad tional all-round champion in 1919 and 1921, national champion in 1922. In the Harvard meet in 1922 he took first place in the 120-yard high hurdles, shot-put, and discus throw; second in the high jump and broad jump. Theodore W. Drews '25 was na\u00ad tional pentathlon champion in 1926. Another versatile performer was Ben\u00ad jamin van D. Hedges '30. In the Cor\u00ad nell meet in 1929 he took first place in the 120-yard high hurdles and broad jump and tied for first in the high jump and pole vault. Hedges was amphibi\u00ad ous; 1929 intercollegiate champion in 474 TRACK AND FIELD the high jump, that same year he was adjudged the second best diver in the swimming intercoUegiates. On Fitzpatrick's retirement in 1932, Princeton's appreciation of the contri\u00ad bution he had made was summed up by Dean Gauss in these words: \"Born one of Nature's gentlemen, in his disap\u00ad pointments as in his triumphs he was and remains for all of us the perfect sportsman.\" THE OXFORD-CAMBRIDGE MEETS In 1920 a friendship struck up at the Penn Relays between Charles R. Erdman '19, Princeton track captain, and Bevil Rudd, Oxford track captain, led to an Oxford-Princeton meet in 1920 which in turn led to a series often meets between Oxford-Cambridge teams and Princeton-Cornell teams held between 1921 and 1949. Princeton won from Oxford in 1920. Of the other ten meets, the first, in 1921, resulted in a tie, Oxford-Cambridge won four (1925, 1926, 1934, 1937), and Princeton-Cornell won five (1929, 1930, 1933, 1938, 1949). These meets were held alternately in England and the United States. Athletes from both teams lived and trained together, and at one post-meet dinner, a speaker from the British Embassy said he couldn't tell them apart until on that warm July evening, all present took off their coats. Then, he said, he recog\u00ad nized the Oxford and Cambridge men by their \"braces.\" Champion quarter- miler William E. Stevenson '22 was the most equitable contributor to interna\u00ad tional amity. After losing to England's Olympic champion Bevil Rudd, in 1920, he beat him in 1921; and then in 1925, as a Rhodes Scholar, won the event for Oxford-Cambridge against both Princeton-Cornell and Harvard- Yale. THE GEIS YEARS Keene Fitzpatrick was succeeded in 1932 by Matthew T. Geis, an ener\u00ad getic, warm-hearted coach who had made a distinguished record at the Lawrenceville School. An old middle- distance runner himself, Geis had among his earliest proteges another middle-distance runner, William R. Bonthron '34, who attained pre\u00ad eminence among Princeton track athletes similar to that of Johnny Cre- gan in the late nineties. Indeed their careers followed parallel courses. Bonthron's double victory in the 800 and 1500 meters in the 1933 and 1934 intercoUegiates duplicated Cregan's in the 1898 intercoUegiates, and his triple victory in the 800, 1500, and 3000 meter runs in the 1933 and 1934 Yale meets matched Cregan's feat against Cornell in 1900. His 4:08.7 mile in 1933 set a Princeton record which survived until 1968. In 1934 the Amateur Ath\u00ad letic Union's James E. Sullivan medal was awarded to Bonthron as the out\u00ad standing amateur athlete of the year and a track trophy was established in his honor at Princeton. In Bonthron's senior year Asa S. Bushnell '21, then graduate manager of athletics, organized, with Matty Geis, an invitation track meet at reunion time which was continued as an annual event through 1940. These meets brought into competition some of the outstand\u00ad ing track athletes of the day, and pro\u00ad duced a number of new world's re\u00ad cords. Two other proteges of Geis were double winners in the intercoUegiates: Harvey M. Kelsey Jr. '45 and Paul F. Cowie '46, champions in the 100 and 220-yard dashes in 1943 and 1948 re\u00ad spectively. Three others were two-time intercollegiate winners: Standish F. Medina '37 in the pole vault in 1936 THE TREASURER 475 and 1937, Anson Perina '40 in the broad jump in 1938 and 1939, E Morgan Taylor, Jr. 53 in the broad jump in 1952 and 1953. The greatest team of the Geis era was Captain Peter B. Bradley's in 1938. It beat all six opponents in dual meets and placed first in the Heptagonal Games (established in 1935 by Columbia, Cor\u00ad nell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Penn, Princeton, and Yale). When Geis retired in 1956, only one past Princeton record remained intact: Ben Hedges' &AW high jump of 1929. RECENT YEARS Under Peter J. Morgan, Jr., succes\u00ad sor to Geis, Princeton track athletes continued the inexorable process of running faster, leaping higher or longer, or throwing farther than their predecessors. Hedges' 32-year-old high-jump record was finally broken by a freshman, John Hartnett '64, who cleared the cross-bar at 6'6 in 1961; he later did 6'9V\u00a3. That same year, Charles Mitchell bettered Stan Medina's record with a leap of 14 feet; a year later he made it 15 feet. Mitchell found pole-vaulting not unlike poetry (\"You can put emo\u00ad tion and feeling into it; there's real beauty and timing in pole-vaulting. When I'm vaulting I feel alone, apart from everyone. That's how it is with my poetry.\") In 1968, the two-mile relay team set a new Princeton record for that event (7:25). In the same year, one of its members, Alan J. Andreini '68, shaved seven-tenths of a second off Bonthron's thirty-five-year-old record for the mile, and another member, Werner E. En- drikat '68, set a new Princeton record in the half-mile (1:48) and became Princeton's only three-time winner in the Heptagonals. Lawrence Ellis succeeded Morgan as track and cross-country coach in 1970. A graduate of New York University, where he was a top-flight middle- distance runner and an intercollegiate champion in cross-country, Ellis was the first black to be appointed a head coach in the Ivy League. Under Ellis, Princeton's participa\u00ad tion in indoor track has expanded, helped by the new facilities made avail\u00ad able with the completion of the Jadwin Gymnasium in 1969. Princeton teams have become noted for their success in dual meet competition, indoors as well as outdoors. True to the tradition begun in Johnny Cregan's day, and carried on in Ian Mackenzie's, Bill Bonthron's, and Alan Andreini's, Ellis's two-mile relay teams captured both the IC4A and NCAA championships in 1975, and the Heptagonal championship in 1976 and again in 1977. The relay's anchor man, Craig Masback '77, added further luster to the Cregan-Mackenzie-Bonthron- Andreini tradition in the mile run by winning that event in the 1977 indoor IC4A championships with the best time ever recorded by a Princeton miler\u2014 4:01.8. Treasurer, The, occupies one of Princeton's oldest offices, the first in\u00ad cumbent having been appointed in 1748, a year after the election of the first president. In the eighteenth cen\u00ad tury and during most of the nineteenth, it was a part-time office, usually held by a trustee, occasionally by a member of the faculty. Beginning in 1885, the following served as treasurers full-time: Edwin C. Osborn, 1885-1901; Henry G. Duffield 1881, 1901-1930; George C. Wintringer 1894, 1930-1941. 476 THE TRIANGLE CLUB George A. Brakeley '07, who came to Princeton in 1939 as financial vice-pres\u00ad ident, assumed the office of treasurer also in 1941. Ricardo A. Mestres '31 succeeded Brakeley as treasurer in 1953, and was financial vice-president and treasurer from 1959 to 1972. Carl W. Schafer was treasurer from 1972 to 1976 (while Paul B. Firstenberg '55 was financial vice-president) and became financial vice-president and treasurer in 1976. The financial vice-president and treasurer has oversight, under the pres\u00ad ident, of the business operations of the University. He has charge, under the trustees' committee on finance, of all the Corporation's assets\u2014funds, stocks, securities, real estate\u2014and is responsible for preparing the annual budget for approval by the trustees. Triangle Club, The, evolved from the Princeton College Dramatic Associa\u00ad tion, which changed its name to Triangle Club in 1893, ten years after its founding. Two years before, the as\u00ad sociation had given up formal drama for musical comedy, and, according to Booth Tarkington 1893, the new name, which fittingly referred to a musical in\u00ad strument, was inspired by a favorite walk* on which students would sing Henry Van Dyke 1874's Triangle Song: \"Well the Old Triangle knew the music of our tread I How the peace\u00ad ful Seminole [Seminary student] would tremble in his bed I How the gates were left unhinged, the lamps without a head I While we were marching through Princeton.\" In his senior year, as president of the Dramatic Association, Tarkington wrote \"The Honorable Julius Caesar,\" a musical parody of Shakespeare's play that was performed again the following year as the Triangle Club's first produc\u00ad tion. Tarkington played the part of Cas-sius, for whose \"lean and hungry look\" he was well cast, being, as Jesse Lynch Williams 1892 wrote, \"woefully gaunt, almost cadaverous.\" To provide a home for the Triangle Club\u2014its early performances were staged in University Hall's dining room\u2014Tarkington initiated a campaign that raised funds for a small building erected in 1895 on what was then the lower campus. For more than a quarter of a century this modest structure, which was called the Casino, served as a home for club rehearsals and local performances, as a place for dances, tennis, and bowling, and as an armory for a local company of the National Guard. Outstanding among early Triangle shows was \"Tobasco Land\" (1905-06), which was enthusiastically received. \"What these players lack in technique,\" Professor Stockton Axson said in a Prince review, \"they make up for by their superior intelligence and manifest glee in acting\"\u2014an observation that could apply to a long line of shows that followed. \"Tobasco Land\" was distin\u00ad guished by the music and lyrics of Ken\u00ad neth S. Clark '05 (composer of \"Going Back to Nassau Hall\"). One of Clark's hits was \"Floating on a Marcel Wave \": And it's oh, my lads, yo-ho, How the ladies all pursue me! And it's ev'ry where I go, They are always clinging to me. As a breaker-up of homes I'm a reckless sort of knave, Whene'er I go -floating on a Marcel wave. In the years just before the First World War, Triangle shows were en\u00ad livened by the lyrics of F. Scott Fitzgerald '17, who also appeared on stage as a very attractive chorus girl. One show entitled \"Fie, Fie, Fi-Fi!\" (1914-15) became \"Ha-Ha Hortense!\" THE TRIANGLE CLUB 477 in This Side of Paradise, where Fitzgerald, describing a classically hec\u00ad tic rehearsal, says: \"How a Triangle show ever got off was a mystery, but it was a riotous mystery anyway, whether or not one did enough service to wear a little gold triangle on his watch-chain.\" Another show, \"The Evil Eye\" (1915- 16), for which he wrote the lyrics, em\u00ad ployed the talents of two other students who became well-known writers, Ed\u00ad mund Wilson 16, who wrote the book, and John Peale Bishop 17, who was a member of the cast. In the postwar years the club at\u00ad tained a high point in its history under Donald Clive Stuart, Professor of Dra\u00ad matic Literature, who directed per\u00ad formances from 1919 to 1934. An up\u00ad dated version of \"The Honorable Julius Caesar,\" (1918-19) and \"The Isle of Surprise\" (1919-20) introduced a Gil\u00ad bert and Sullivan kind of show, remark\u00ad able for the clever dialogue and lyrics of Hope Coffey '20 and the tuneful melodies of Erdman Harris '20, whose evocation of Triangle music at alumni reunions in later years made him one of the best known of Triangle men. A memorable song of this period, \"One Hour More\" (\"Just one hour more is all I crave / For one hour more I'll be your slave\"), from the 1921- 22 show \"Espanola,\" was still being hummed at reunions fifty years later. It was composed by Louis E. Tilden '22 and played by him on his accordion, as it was sung by his classmate J. Russell Forgan '22. The song's opening notes are inscribed on a piano at Prospect as well as outside Woolworth Music Cen\u00ad ter's Room 108, which was given by Forgan and Tilden to commemorate their Triangle collaboration and life\u00ad long friendship. Another star of the twenties was Wal\u00ad lace H. Smith '24, one of the finest comedians in the club's history. In his senior year he wrote \"Drake's Drum,\" based on a poem about Sir Francis Drake by the English poet Alfred Noyes, a visiting professor at Princeton. Critics called this the best Triangle production ever; its book, dialogue, music, lyrics, costumes, scenery, acting, and dancing were all effectively combined to make it a standard by which succeeding shows were judged. Best known and longest remembered among several outstand\u00ad ing hits was \"Ships That Pass In The Night,\" whose lyrics and music, by Smith, appear on the following page. Four other numbers in the show were written by Robert M. Crawford '25, who also did the orchestration and played the part of Sir Francis Drake. \"Drake's Drum\" was the first of seven shows that were put on without a local theater, the old Casino having burned down in January 1924. By 1930 the club had secured a permanent home, whose cost was met by a $250,000 gift from Thomas N. McCar- ter 1888, for whom the theater was named; by Triangle Club earnings of over $100,000; and by other gifts, in\u00ad cluding the proceeds of a benefit per\u00ad formance by the Hasty Pudding Club of Harvard. The last years of Dr. Stuart's di\u00ad rectorship were enlivened by a very talented group of undergraduates who produced a number of notable shows and who later made their marks in the performing arts. Best known among them in college and afterward were Joshua Logan '31, James Stewart '32 and Jose Ferrer '33. Logan helped write the book and played leading roles in \"Zuider Zee\" (1930-31). Stewart had parts in the last two of these and also played the lead in \"Spanish Blades\" (1931-32). Ferrer, who joined the Triangle Club SHIPS THAT PASS IN THE NIGHT 65 From the Triangle Club show \"Drake's Drum\" Used by permission of the Theodore Preiser Co , owner's of the copyright 4H5U Copyright, 1923, by The John Church Company Words and Music by W . H. Smith, '24 Slowly and dreamily THE TRIANGLE CLUB 479 his senior year, was the bright spot in \"It's the Valet\" (1932-33). Other talented members of this group were actor Charles Arnt '29, who went on to a career in Hollywood; writer Eric Barnouw '29, who became dramatic arts professor at Columbia; writer and actor A. Munroe Wade '30, later a leader in theater productions and a drama teacher in the Princeton community; set designer Norris Houghton '31, later a founder of the Phoenix Theater and a drama professor; and Myron McCormick '31, who was a comic hit in \"The Tiger Smiles\" as he was later in Logan's \"South Pacific.\" \"The Tiger Smiles,\" a satire on student life put together by Logan when he was club president, was highly praised by the Prince as \"a grand show, brilliant and original.\" Following Dr. Stuart's retirement, the club had a succession of directors including Logan and several other Triangle alumni. The first of several shows that Logan was associated with, \"Stags at Bay\" (1934-35), earned en\u00ad thusiastic reviews on its tour, sold out two nights running in New York, and had three memorable songs: \"Will Love Find a Way?\" by Brooks Bowman '36 and Kirkland B. Alexander, Jr. '37, and \"Love and a Dime\" and \"East of the Sun (and West of the Moon)\" by Bowman. \"East of the Sun\" was proba\u00ad bly the most popular and longest- lasting hit nationally ever to come out of the Triangle Club. The 1940s brought several good shows. \"Ask Me Another\" (1941-42), a swift-paced review based on the Gallup Poll and organized by club president Mark Lawrence, prompted Variety to say \"the Princeton lads really have something this year.\" The first postwar show, \"Clear the Track\" (1946-47), satirized the University's Bicentennial Year to the delight of the Prince, which pronounced it an undoubted hit be\u00ad cause of its spontaneous gaiety and its excellent music. In 1955-56 Milton Lyon began a long and successful directorship with the production of \"Spree de Corps,\" which one veteran reviewer thought \"the best of them all.\" This show was put to\u00ad gether in its initial stages by Triangle president D. Brooks Jones '56, who later became head of Cincinnati's Playhouse in the Park. The 1960s produced a number of creditable performances, some of them displaying the talents of exceptional writers. \"Breakfast in Bedlam\" (1959- 60) and \"Tour de Farce\" (1961-62) made summer tours of United States army bases in Europe. All of the music and some of the lyrics of the tuneful \"Breakfast in Bedlam\" were written by Clark Gesner '60, in later years author of the popular off-Broadway musical \"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.\" Jeffrey Moss '63, who collaborated with John Simon '63 in writing the book, music, and lyrics for \"Ahead of the Game\" (1962-63) was head writer for TV's forma\u00ad tive years. \"Funny Side Up\" (1963-64) found much favor with alumni for its pleasing revival of songs and skits from past productions. \"Grape Expecta\u00ad tions\" (1964-65) and \"A Different Kick\" (1968-69) won prizes as the best college shows in the country. In 1971 alumni representing fifty years of the club's history came back to Princeton to honor Benjamin Franklin Bunn 07, graduate treasurer from 1908 to 1965, who had died at the age of ninety-six. At their memorial gathering in McCarter, called \"One Hour More for Uncle Ben,\" they sang hits from the past and listened to affectionate remi\u00ad niscences by Josh Logan and others 480 TRUSTEES OF PRINCETON UNIVERSITY about the man who had \"chaperoned\" their Christmas tours for half a century. At the conclusion, Jimmie Stewart read the text for a plaque in memory of Bunn, and as the lights dimmed, un\u00ad dergraduate men and women from the current show, holding lighted candles, lined the aisles of the theatre, and sang \"All the Ships That Pass in the Night.\" With the advent of coeducation in 1969, the Triangle Club was able to as\u00ad sign to women the female roles for\u00ad merly taken by men. In the chorus lines, however, the club on occasion managed to enjoy the best of the old and new worlds by having men portray women, as was done in the successful 1974-75 production, \"American Zuc\u00ad chini. \" This entertaining examination of a day in the life of a Princeton under\u00ad graduate, was directed, as were most of its twenty predecessors, by Milton Lyon. What Triangle has meant to genera\u00ad tions of undergraduates was summed up by Joshua Logan in the foreword to its history, The Long Kickline by Donald Marsden '64, which the club's Board of Trustees brought out in 1968: . . . The Triangle Club, smiling like a basketful of cats, lives on as though it had nine-times-nine lives. It is the Great Vitrine for youth, the Bulletin Board for young ideas, the proving ground for talent that still is permit\u00ad ted to fumble; it is a place to sing, to do pratfalls, to thumb one's nose at authority, to test the last liberties of adolescence, to taste the true wine of being an American. . . . George S. Stephenson * The sides of the Triangle Walk were Stock\u00ad ton and Mercer Streets, the apex their junction at University Place, the base of the \"Little Triangle,\" Lover's Lane, and of the \"Big Tri\u00ad angle,\" Quaker Road. \"Trustees of Princeton University\" is the legal title of the corporation that is empowered to \"conduct a university not for profit.\" There are a maximum of forty trus\u00ad tees, of whom two (the governor of the state and the president of the Univer\u00ad sity) serve ex-officio; thirteen are elected by alumni and students, and the remainder are chosen by the board itself. Four of those chosen by the Board are called term trustees and serve four years, as do all of the thir\u00ad teen trustees elected by alumni and students. The rest of those chosen by the board are called charter trustees; those elected prior to 1969 serve until their seventieth birthday, those elected in 1969 and thereafter, for terms of ten years. Of the original twelve trustees named in the College's first charter in 1746, nine were clergymen, one was a merchant, one\u2014the person who drafted the charter\u2014a lawyer, and the twelfth was that indispensable adjunct of a privately endowed college\u2014\"a man of leisure and wealth and given to good works.\" The youngest of the twelve was twenty-three. The oldest, Jonathan Dickinson, the first president of the col\u00ad lege, was fifty-eight. The twenty-three trustees named in a second charter, granted in 1748, rep\u00ad resented a broader spectrum of society and reflected the founders' avowed purpose of raising up men who would be \"ornaments of the State as well as the Church.\" Added were the governor of the Province, Jonathan Belcher, and four members of the provincial council of New Jersey as well as two judges and a merchant in Philadelphia. Now there were twelve clergymen\u2014a clerical majority of one. TRUSTEES OF PRINCETON UNIVERSITY 481 The clergymen maintained this majority of one for more than a century. As the number of trustees was in\u00ad creased after the Civil War, more laymen were appointed, and although there were still twelve clergymen they were now outnumbered. As late as 1905 the by-laws stipulated that at least twelve trustees should be clergymen, but the following year the number was reduced to eight, and in 1913 this re\u00ad quirement was removed completely. The present by-laws make no occupa\u00ad tional stipulation whatever. Most of the original trustees were graduates of Yale, Harvard, or William Tennent's \"Log College\" in Neshaminy, Pennsylvania, but a dec\u00ad ade later graduates of the College began infiltrating its Board of Trustees. Richard Stockton (q.v.), a member of the first graduating class of 1748, who practiced law in Princeton, became the first in 1757 and was joined four years later by his classmate, Israel Read, minister at Bound Brook. By 1768, when John Witherspoon became presi\u00ad dent, there were five graduates of the College on the board; a century later, under McCosh, there were seventeen. In recent years, with few exceptions, every trustee has been a Princeton alumnus. One non-Princetonian, John A. Stewart, was an active member of the board longer than any other trustee in Princeton's history. A graduate of Co\u00ad lumbia College in 1840, and a trusted financial adviser to President Lincoln and later to President Cleveland, Stewart was elected a Princeton trustee in 1868 and continued to serve until his death in 1926 at the age of 104. He was acting president of the University in the interregnum between the Wilson and Hibben administrations. ALUMNI TRUSTEES In 1900, in recognition of the increas\u00ad ing part that alumni were playing in Princeton's growth, the board amended the charter and by-laws to permit add\u00ad ing to its membership five trustees to be elected annually by the alumni. This number became eight in 1917, and the method of election was subsequently modified several times, resulting in a plan adopted in 1934 which provided that two alumni trustees be elected an\u00ad nually, one from a region by vote of alumni living in that region, the other chosen at large by vote of the entire alumni body, in both instances from among candidates nominated by a nine-man committee of the Alumni Council. The range of alumni trusteeships was further extended by two developments in the 1960s. The first came in 1963 with the addition of a ninth alumni trus\u00ad tee representing the graduate school, elected for a four-year term once every four years from among candidates nominated by the Princeton Graduate Alumni Association and voted upon by the entire alumni body. Further additions were made in 1969 when increasing student interest in the governance of the University led the board to provide for four more alumni trustees, one elected each year from the graduating class by vote of the members of the junior and senior classes and of the two most recently graduated classes, to serve a term of four years. The latter provision was made ret\u00ad roactive by the election of two trustees in May 1969. Richard W. Cass '68, aged twenty-two, was elected for a three-year term and Brent L. Henry '69, aged twenty-one, was elected for a four-year term. Henry had the double 482 TRUSTEES OF PRINCETON UNIVERSITY distinction of being the youngest man and the first black to be elected a Princeton trustee. At the same time the board revoked the rule that alumni trustees elected by regions and at large must have been members of classes out of college at least ten years. CHARTER AND TERM TRUSTEES Meanwhile changes had been made affecting trustees elected by the board itself. In 1942, in an act of self-restraint led by Albert G. Milbank 1896, the board renounced the right to life tenure that trustees had enjoyed for almost two centuries. \"Life trustees\" became \"charter trustees,\" committed to re\u00ad tirement at age seventy with the title \"trustee emeritus.\" This change opened up vacancies for oncoming gen\u00ad erations at earlier dates and compelled a more rapid change-over of committee chairmanships traditionally retained by the same persons over long periods of time. In 1956 the board reduced the number of charter trustees by four, re\u00ad placing them with term trustees, elected by the board for four-year terms. This new classification permit\u00ad ted the board to use the services of a greater number of persons whose spe\u00ad cial knowledge and judgment might be needed at various times in the Univer\u00ad sity's development. As a further means of achieving greater diversity in the age, interests and background of trustees, the board in 1969 set a ten-year limit for terms of service of charter trustees elected on or after July 1 of that year. The Board added women to its membership for the first time in 1971 when it elected as charter trustees, Mary St. John Douglas and Susan Sav\u00ad age Speers (daughters of alumni in the classes of 1905 and 1920 and wives of alumni in the classes of 1943 and 1950). TRUSTEE COMMITTEES Until 1939, the governor of New Jer\u00ad sey was the presiding officer of the Board. Since then, the president of the University has presided and, in his ab\u00ad sence, the chairman of the Executive Committee of the trustees, who serves as spokesman for the board. Starting with the McCosh adminis\u00ad tration, most of the work of the trustees has been done by standing committees, of which there are now nine: executive, finance, curriculum, grounds and buildings, plans and resources, library, student life, health and athletics, and honorary degrees. Between board meetings, the executive committee has all the powers and duties of the board except that of removing or electing a trustee or the president. The Executive Committee (originally called the Administrative Committee, and headed by the president) was first instituted in 1919. Its chairmen have included Edward D. Duffield 1892, Walter E. Hope Ol, Fordyce B. St. John 5, Harold H. Helm '20, James F. Oates, Jr. '21, John N. Irwin II '37, and R. Manning Brown '36. TRUSTEES' ROLE AND FUNCTION Relations between the trustees and the administration and faculty have sometimes been strained. Early in the nineteenth century the trustees made frequent visitations to Princeton and in\u00ad terfered with the faculty in matters of discipline. \"Unhappily,\" President Maclean later observed, \"there were no railroads to take the trustees to their homes in those days.\" President McCosh complained that the board was \"full of old dotards and sometimes they go to sleep,\" and Moses Taylor Pyne MARK TWAIN 483 recalled that \"the Trustees spent most of their time fighting Doctor McCosh.\" In recent times, the situation has changed markedly. In a speech to the alumni at the close of his administra\u00ad tion, President Dodds commended the trustees for their understanding of the function of a university, and \"for the respect they pay to the professional province of the faculty and to the responsibilities which pertain to the administration.\" \"I have known college presidents,\" President Dodds said, \"who always took to their beds for the weekend following a meeting of their trustees. My sworn testimony is that I have never attended a meeting of our board which did not give a lift to my heart.\" In his annual report of 1968, Presi\u00ad dent Goheen said that he had often been struck by how little is known about the role and function of univer\u00ad sity trustees in general and about Princeton's board in particular, and that \"this is the more regrettable be\u00ad cause, in my close observation, Prince\u00ad ton's Trustees merit so much trust.\" Their sense of their role [he con\u00ad tinued] is almost always one of serv\u00ad ice and the best interests of the Uni\u00ad versity, not a matter of vested rights or of power. They hold a public trust to carry out specified educational purposes , . . They . . . have a general responsi\u00ad bility for the kind of education and kind of research conducted by the University, and for their bearing on the public interest . . . [leaving] the specific determination of academic programs and the conduct of instruc\u00ad tion to professionals\u2014that is, the faculty and academic administration. With this basic public trust. . . go also binding legal and fiscal obliga\u00adtions. It is the Trustees alone who can hold title to the material assets and property of Princeton Univer\u00ad sity, and responsibility for the man\u00ad agement of its funds rests directly on them. With respect to the latter, Princeton's twentieth-century record is superb. Even during the Great Depression, when salary slashes were the order of the day on Ameri\u00ad can campuses, Princeton managed to avoid them through the Trustees' good management of the funds in their charge. More recently, the simultaneous growth of the Universi\u00ad ty's endowment and of the annual re\u00ad turn on this endowment has been impressive. . . . More than any one in the Univer\u00ad sity, the Trustees have to carry the sense of a trust held in perpetuity. On them rests the responsibility to a university whose future is no less important than its present or its past . . . On many fronts\u2014provision for the Library, for health and athletics, for student affairs, for faculty and staff housing and benefits, for curricular developments and the enlistment of financial support; in interpreting the University to those outside and de\u00ad fending its best interests; in trying to assess the varied opportunities and obligations which confront the Uni\u00ad versity at any and all times\u2014the Princeton Trustees are, indeed, working trustees. Twain, Mark, who visited Princeton in the early 1900s, considered coming here to live. \"Princeton would suit me as well as Heaven,\" he wrote his friend, Laurence Hutton, a former editor of Harper's who was a lecturer in the University, \"better in fact, for I shouldn't care for that society up there.\" 484 THE UNIVERSITY LEAGUE University League, The. On April 13, 1920, at the suggestion of Mrs. Dana Munro, 171 \"women of the Faculty, Library and Administration\" were in\u00ad vited by the faculty tea committee to meet at Prospect. At this meeting, with Mrs. Hibben presiding, the University League was founded \"to promote a friendly spirit among wives and families of men connected with the University.\" Membership in the League has been broadened in recent years to include all \"women who are, or whose husbands are, members of the University faculty, administration or staff.\" The four presidents' wives during the life of the League, Mrs. Hibben, Mrs. Dodds, Mrs. Goheen, and Mrs. Bowen, have been very close to it, serv\u00ad ing as president or chairmen as well as giving support and entertainment. In the early days teas were a larger part of the League's social activities than they are today, with weekly teas often honoring different departments in the University. League-sponsored par\u00ad ties at Prospect on Christmas night, when all the faculty could fit comfort\u00ad ably into the president's home, were especially gala occasions with dancing, mah-jong, bridge, music, and refresh\u00ad ments. As late as 1941, a leaflet on \"Advice to Newcomers in the University League\" advised women what to wear, when to return calls, and how many calling cards to leave. Hats, white gloves, and calling cards are gone, but League-sponsored dances, teas, buffet suppers, theatre parties, and trips are still part of the program. The varied so\u00ad cial activities have helped newcomers to feel a part of the University family and have encouraged friendships across age limits, departmental lines, and na\u00ad tional barriers. Special interest groups have covered foreign languages, travel, child care, literature, the performing arts, sports, and a wide variety of other subjects ranging from Shakespeare to international cooking. The service activities of the League have continued to increase in impor\u00ad tance. A Business Registry was started in 1927, so that members' skills might be matched with faculty needs. In 1967 the League began a Job Roster for pro\u00ad fessional women seeking employment, which in 1972 was merged with the Professional Roster, a volunteer com\u00ad munity organization. One of the League's concerns has been to make foreign visitors feel wel\u00ad come. For many years host families have been matched with foreign families. A very active English Conver\u00ad sation Group has held weekly sessions with foreign visitors. The League was instrumental in creating the Interna\u00ad tional Center, an office and lounge to serve students and faculty from foreign countries. Two other important League services have been the University Nursery School, where parents assist the four teachers and repair equipment to keep tuition costs low, and the Furniture Exchange, where furniture is acquired, reconditioned, and made available, at minimal fees, for members of the Uni\u00ad versity community. The service objectives of the League have been helped by memorial gifts for medical emergencies and for scholar\u00ad ships for the University League Nursery School. Among those honored by funds for these purposes are Jenny Davidson Hibben, Mary Blanchard Magie, Ethel Palmer Morgan, Sir Hugh and Lady Taylor, Esther Bentley, and Elise Fitch. In 1967 the University League and the Art Museum began two programs, a Docent or Lecture Guide Program and THE VALEDICTORY ORATION 485 an Art Interest Group featuring Gallery talks and lectures. Both programs were incorporated into the Museum Volun\u00ad teers, who conduct guided tours, pres\u00ad ent slide shows to community school children, and serve at the Art Museum desk answering questions and selling books, catalogues, and cards. In recent years the League offices were moved to 171 Broadmead where the Dorothy Brown Room, the Grace Marckwardt Room, a workroom, and a kitchen provide much-needed space. Jane G. Dix Upper and Lower Pyne, gifts of Moses Taylor Pyne 1877, were built in 1896. Lower Pyne still stands at the northeast corner of Nassau and Witherspoon streets. Upper Pyne was razed in 1963 to make way for the Princeton Bank and Trust Company building at 76 Nas\u00ad sau Street. Upper and Lower Pyne were designed by Raleigh C. GiI- dersleeve on the model of sixteenth- century houses in Chester, England. They were planned to provide space for shops at the street level, dormitory rooms for undergraduates in the stories above. In 1950 the dormitory rooms were converted to offices. A sundial on the front of Upper Pyne bore on its face a Latin epigram about the passing hours which proved to be prophetic: VULNERANT OMNES: ULTIMA NECAT (They all wound, the last one kills). Valedictory Oration, The, was first given by a graduating senior in 1760. Originally, a high-ranking student with particular talents for the part delivered the valedictory, and the highest rank\u00ad ing senior gave the salutatory (q.v.). In recent years the faculty has chosen both speakers for their special qualifications for the parts, as well as for their high scholastic standing. One of the earliest valedictorians was James Roosevelt 1780, great-grand\u00ad father of Franklin D. Roosevelt. George Mifflin Dallas, valedictorian in 1810, became the eleventh vice- president of the United States. William Jay Magie, valedictorian in 1852, be\u00ad came chancellor of New Jersey; son, William Francis Magie was valedicto\u00ad rian in 1879 and later dean of the fac\u00ad ulty. John Grier Hibben, fourteenth pres\u00ad ident of the University, was valedicto\u00ad rian in 1882; Norman Thomas in 1905; John Foster Dulles in 1908; Henry P. Van Dusen, later a trustee, in 1919. Several valedictorians became mem\u00ad bers of E. '28, Gordon A. Craig '36, James H. Billington '50. Over the years valedictory orations have, by and large, tried to sum up the Princeton experience in relation to the world the seniors were entering. Woodrow Wilson's Sesquicentennial oration, \"Princeton in the Nation's Service\" (q.v.), back\u00ad ground for a number of valedictories. \"We owe this University a debt we cannot pay,\" Donald A. StaufFer told his classmates in 1923. \"The least we can do is to remember and honor the tradition of national service, the obliga\u00ad tion Princeton imposes upon us to use our minds, never to let them yield on the rack of this tough world.\" Using the Wilson motto in his val\u00ad edictory oration at the 1936 com\u00ad mencement, Gordon A. Craig, later professor of history at Princeton, and Stanford, said it was of the utmost im\u00ad portance that this tradition be pre\u00ad served, \"for, at no time in the life of the state, has there been a greater need for men with trained minds.\" 486 HENRY PITNEY VAN DUSEN In 1964, Wilfried Schmid, who, at twenty-six, became professor of math\u00ad ematics at Columbia, said that world developments in recent years sug\u00ad gested a broader interpretation of Wil\u00ad son's ideals\u2014already implicit in his Sesquicentennial speecli\u2014\"that the University has not only national, but also international responsibilities\"; and, speaking for students from abroad, of whom he was one, he commended Princeton for the way it was meeting these responsibilities. In recent years, many valedictorians have been reluctant to exhort their classmates on political and social ques\u00ad tions. The 1972 valedictorian, Halbert L. White, while expressing a similar re\u00ad luctance, nevertheless voiced his own \"fervent hope for . . . the emergence of an awareness on the part of our country that we no longer can act as an isolated national entity fighting for world domi\u00ad nance, but must instead act as an inte\u00ad gral member of the human and natural community of this planet.\" Van Dusen, Henry Pitney 19 (1897- 1975), world churchman, Christian statesman, and a long-time University trustee, came from a family with strong Princeton associations. His father, George R. Van Dusen 1877, was a lawyer, as were his maternal grand\u00ad father, New Jersey Vice-Chancellor Henry C. Pitney 1848, and three un\u00ad cles, Henry C. Pitney, Jr. 1877, Su\u00ad preme Court Justice Mahlon Pitney 1879, and Princeton trustee John O. H. Pitney 1881. Pit Van Dusen was one of the leaders of his college generation, serving as chairman of the Undergraduate Coun\u00ad cil, president of the Philadelphian So\u00ad ciety (the student Christian associa\u00ad tion), and captain of the University de\u00ad bating team. As a sophomore, he took part in the revolt against the eating clubs led by his classmate, Richard F. Cleveland. The winner of Phi Beta Kappa honors, he gave the Ivy oration on Class Day and the Valedictory at Commencement, and was voted by his class \"the best all-round man outside athletics\" and the \"most likely to suc\u00ad ceed.\" After college, Van Dusen served as graduate secretary of the Philadelphian Society for two years and then took up theological study, the first year at New College, Edinburgh, the next two at Union Theological Seminary in New York, obtaining his bachelor of divinity degree there, summa cum laude, in 1924. Later, in the early 1930s, he re\u00ad turned to Scotland, where he com\u00ad pleted graduate work for his Ph.D. at Edinburgh and was married in Inver\u00ad ness to Elizabeth Coghill Bartholo\u00ad mew, daughter of the late cartographer to the king. The year he graduated from Union, his ordination was challenged by a con\u00ad servative-minded judicial commission of the Presbyterian General Assembly because he declined to affirm the literal Biblical account of the virgin birth. He overcame the challenge with the help of a notable brief in his support by John Foster Dulles '08. Following his ordination, Van Dusen spent two years visiting American col\u00ad leges from coast to coast seeking to interpret religion to undergraduates, and then began his long career at Union Theological Seminary as an instructor in 1926. He became dean of students in 1932, Roosevelt professor of systematic theology in 1936, and tenth president in 1945, occupying that office for eight\u00ad een years. Under his vigorous leader\u00ad ship, the seminary attained world-wide significance as a center for theological study. HENRY PITNEY VAN DUSEN 487 Van Dusen left his mark on world Christianity as a leader in the ecu\u00ad menical movement, playing a promi\u00ad nent part in the founding of the World Council of Churches and paving the way for its union with the International Missionary Council as chairman of the joint commission representing both bodies. He traveled around the world twice, touching down at some sixty countries on six continents. A tireless worker, he was a trustee of a dozen institutions, among them the Rockefeller Foundation, Vassar, and Smith\u2014as well as Princeton, where he held one of the University's longest trustee tenures: thirty-four years, twenty-one of them as chairman of the curriculum committee. Also included among some fifty \"extracurricular\" re\u00ad sponsibilities were his services as chairman of numerous committees of various religious organizations, and as president or board chairman of the As\u00ad sociation of American Theological Schools, the United Board for Christian Higher Education in Asia, and the Union Settlement Association. Van Dusen was the author or editor of some twenty-five books, among them For the Healing of the Nations: Im\u00ad pressions of Christianity Around the World (1940), The Vindication of Lib\u00ad eral Theology (1963), and Dag Ham- marskjold: The Statesman and His Faith (1967), written in tribute to the United Nations' second Secretary- General, who, in Van Dusen's Saints' and\u2014within it\u2014an eternal life.\" Van Dusen's achievements were acclaimed by the Union Faculty and Board of Directors in their final trib\u00ad utes. \"In the long history of the Semi\u00ad nary,\" the Faculty declared, \"Van Du\u00ad sen's presidency stands out as the high-water mark of its achievement. He . . . enlarged not only the personal and physical resources of the Seminary, but above all, its spirit and its outreach.\" The Board of Directors saluted him as \"one of the first World Churchmen of our era, a scholar, a statesman, a leader, and\u2014not least\u2014a friend.\" After his retirement as president of Union Seminary in 1963, Van Dusen and his wife made their home in Princeton. Besides continuing to write, he served on various boards, and vis\u00ad ited churches around the world to keep in touch with seminary alumni and to promote world Christianity\u2014until 1970, when he suffered a severe stroke that limited his physical activity and made normal speech impossible. At the same time, Mrs. Van Dusen was the victim of a steadily worsening and in\u00ad creasingly painful arthritic condition. In January 1975, the Van Dusens\u2014 both members of the Euthanasia So\u00ad ciety\u2014took overdoses of sleeping pills to end their lives. Mrs. Van Dusen died immediately, Van Dusen fifteen days later. A letter they left for their three sons and other relatives and friends said that they had led happy lives, but that increasingly poor health no longer permitted them to do what they wanted to do, and that they were not afraid to die. They acknowledged that some would be disappointed, and asked for their understanding. One of Van Dusen's successors as president of Union Theological Semi\u00ad nary, Roger L. Shinn, said he had never seen anybody physically or men\u00ad tally less cut out to be an invalid: \"He had a very strong belief in immortality. His attitude was that, when your time is up, when you have lived out the pos\u00ad sibilities, it is all right to stop, and to go on to the next life.\" Van Dusen's letter concluded with this prayer: \"O Lamb of God, that 488 HENRY VAN DYKE takest away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us. O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world, grant us Thy peace.\" van Dyke, Henry 1873 (1852-1933) was called to Princeton in 1899 from the pastorate of New York's Brick Presby\u00ad terian Church to occupy a chair espe\u00ad cially endowed for him by alumni and named for Dean Murray (q.v.), who had preceded him as pastor of the Brick Church and as professor of English at Princeton. His younger brother, the historian Paul van Dyke 1881, had joined the faculty several years earlier, and the seniors welcomed Henry in the Faculty Song of 1900: Here's to Henry the brother of Paul. He has a large head, but he's not very tall. Although \"not very tall,\" his carriage was erect, and his \"large head\" well- formed and handsome. Whether driv\u00ad ing his Adirondack horses and smart trap to lecture hall in his early years or walking in academic procession in the scarlet gown of an honorary Oxford doctor of letters in later years, van Dyke was always a striking figure. Although he strongly opposed Woodrow Wilson's Quad Plan, Wilson never held this against him, and later appointed him Minister to the Nether\u00ad lands and Luxembourg. He was one of the most popular lecturers in his time, and when he retired in 1923 the trus\u00ad tees congratulated him on having de\u00ad veloped in his students \"an apprecia\u00ad tion of the best in literature and a genuine love of reading.\" He was a prolific writer, producing more than fifty books of stories, essays, and verse. His Christmas story The Other Wise Man was a best seller. translated into many languages, and two books about the outdoors, Little Rivers and Fisherman's Luck, also sold well. He himself considered The Book of Common Worship of the Presbyte\u00ad rian Church, produced in 1906 by a committee which he headed, and re\u00ad vised in 1932 under his direction, his most important contribution. Veblen, Oswald (1880-1960), who played a major role in the development of Princeton and American mathe\u00ad matics, was the grandson of a Norwe\u00ad gian cabinet maker who came to Wis\u00ad consin in 1847 and took up farming. He was the son of Andrew Anderson Veb\u00ad len, a professor of mathematics and physics at the University of Iowa, and the nephew of the economist and social theorist Thorstein Veblen. Oswald Veblen took an A. B. at the University of Iowa in 1898, a second A.B. at Harvard in 1900, and a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in 1903. Dean Fine, who was then building up the mathematics department, heard of Veblen's work at Chicago and, at his suggestion, President Wilson called Veblen to Princeton as one of the origi\u00ad nal preceptors in 1905. Dean Fine had a remarkable knack for picking promising young mathe\u00ad maticians, and none of his excellent choices was more successful than Veb\u00ad len. He soon established himself as a leading geometer whose articles and books were noted for their complete\u00ad ness, precision, and clarity. He at\u00ad tracted many able graduate students, some of whom were added to the fac\u00ad ulty, and he helped Dean Fine recruit other distinguished men for the grow\u00ad ing department. His research and that of his students covered many fields, in\u00ad cluding the foundations of geometry, differential geometry and its connec-OSWALD VEBLEN 489 tion with relativity theory, symbolic logic, and analysis situs (later known as topology). Under his leadership Princeton became one of the world's great centers in topology. His influence in his profession ex\u00ad tended beyond Princeton, earning him his reputation as a \"statesman of math\u00ad ematics.\" As president of the American Mathematical Society in 1923-24, when its funds were low, he led a successful effort to make better known the impor\u00ad tance of mathematics generally and to obtain gifts from foundations, business corporations, and individuals for math\u00ad ematical research and publication. It was on his urging that the National Re\u00ad search Council began granting postdoc\u00ad toral fellowships in mathematics in 1924. When the Henry Burchard Fine Pro\u00ad fessorship, the first American research chair in mathematics, was founded in 1926, Veblen was named its first in\u00ad cumbent. On Dean Fine's death in 1928, Veblen paid him an impressive tribute in a memoir for the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, written in the lucid style that Fine had so admired. And when the Jones family provided funds for the original Fine Hall in 1929, Veblen supplied most of the ideas that went into its design. He conceived of Fine Hall as a center about which mathematicians could (in his words) \"group themselves for mutual encouragement and support,\" and where \"the young recruit and the old campaigner\" could have \"those in\u00ad formal and easy contacts that are so im\u00ad portant to each of them.\" The Common Room, which he hoped would increase the solidarity of the mathematics fac\u00ad ulty and students and encourage their closer relation to the physics group from nearby Palmer, was placed so that everyone had to pass it to get to the li\u00adbrary on the top floor. There was another room of this sort reserved for professors on the principle, \"not always understood by those who try to bring about closer relations between faculty and students,\" Veblen said, \"that in all forms of social intercourse the provi\u00ad sions for privacy are as important as those for proximity.\" In 1932 Veblen resigned the Fine Professorship to accept appointment as the first professor in the Institute for Advanced Study (q.v.), which had just been established. He was largely re\u00ad sponsible for selecting the other mem\u00ad bers of its original mathematics faculty (James W. Alexander II, Albert Ein\u00ad stein, John von Neumann, and Herman Weyl) and also for determining the In\u00ad stitute's policy of concentrating on postdoctoral research. He helped relo\u00ad cate many distinguished foreign math\u00ad ematicians after Hitler's rise to power, and in his later years (as the Institute's director J. Robert Oppenheimer ob\u00ad served) \"provided a real clearing house at the Institute for mathematicians from all over the world.\" The year he retired as professor at the Institute, 1950, his life-long devotion to the advancement of mathematics was recognized by his selection as president of the Interna\u00ad tional Congress of Mathematicians, held at Harvard. All his life Veblen loved the out\u00ad doors. He was influential in the pur\u00ad chase of a large tract of land for the site of the Institute, whose woods provide attractive walks for its members and for the Princeton community. In 1957, he and his wife deeded eighty-one acres of an extent of wooded land where they lived in later years, called by them Herrontown Wood, to Mercer County to provide a place where, in their words, \"you can get away from cars and just walk and sit.\" 490 VETERANS OF FUTURE WARS Veblen was a member of the Ameri\u00ad can Philosophical Society and the Na\u00ad tional Academy of Sciences and a foreign member of the academies of science in Denmark, England, France, Ireland, Italy, Peru, Poland, and Scot\u00ad land. He was awarded honorary de\u00ad grees by Chicago and Princeton, and also by Edinburgh, Glasgow, Ham\u00ad burg, Oslo, and Oxford. And, like his father before him, he was made a Knight of Norway's Royal Order of St. Olaf. Veterans of Future Wars, so goes the legend, sprang full-blown from a tea party at Terrace Club in March 1936. The Founding Father was Lewis Jeffer\u00ad son Gorin, Jr. '36, of Louisville, a poli\u00ad tics major then writing a senior thesis, appropriately enough, on Niccolo Machiavelli. Gorin and the other tea drinkers\u2014 Urban J. P. Rushton '36, Thomas Riggs, Jr. '37, Archibald Lewis '36, Robert G. Barnes '37, John C. Turner '36, Alex\u00ad ander Black, Jr. '36, and a young member of the history faculty, Lynn White, Jr.\u2014were disturbed by an act of Congress that had advanced by ten years\u2014from 1946 to 1936\u2014the date at which the veterans of World War I would receive their long-sought and controversial soldiers' bonuses. This legislation, the consequence of inten\u00ad sive lobbying by the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, struck the Princetonians as an intolera\u00ad ble raid upon the United States Treas\u00ad ury for the benefit of an organized minority. The Veterans of Future Wars was created to satirize the bonus hunters. Their first manifesto in the Princetonian argued that sooner or later there would be another war and that it would only be an act of justice for Congress to grant a $1000 cash bonus to all men between the ages of 18 and 36. Legally the bonus would be payable in 1965, but since Congress seemed bent on paying bonuses before they were due, the ac\u00ad tual payment date should be June 1936, with, of course, an additional 3 percent annual interest compounded back from 1965 to 1936. In this way the future veterans would receive their benefits while all were still alive to enjoy them. A national salute was adopted, a mod\u00ad ified version of the then famous Fascist greeting: an arm held straight out in the direction of Washington, the palm turned up receptively. The Press Club sent out stories, the wire services got interested, and all across the country newspapers ran arti\u00ad cles on the Future Veterans. Over\u00ad night, local chapters mushroomed on college campuses; by June 1936 there were more than 500 chapters and a paid-up membership of over 50,000 students. The Future Veterans were discussed \u2014and denounced\u2014in Congress, and they were vigorously criticized and condemned by the organized veterans movement. The Commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, James Van Zandt, called them \"insolent puppies\" who ought to be spanked. \"They'll never be veterans of a future war,\" he predicted, \"for they are too yellow to go to war.\" The Princetonians replied that since the Veterans of Future Wars was a genuinely patriotic organization, Van Zandt clearly must be a \"Red.\" Activity at other colleges took various forms, but most of what happened at Princeton headquarters was intended simply to laugh the bonus movement to death. This spirit was well summed up by the student who happily noted, as the memberships rolled in, \"Manifest Destiny has laid another golden egg.\" VICE-PRESIDENT 491 What made the Future Veterans an instant success was their rare appeal both to conservatives and to liberals. Conservatives saw the Princetonians as heaven-sent allies who would help them keep FDR from spending the country into bankruptcy. College liberals who were pacifist, anti-war, and anti-mili\u00ad tary saw in the movement an opportu\u00ad nity to satirize war itself. Still, more than a few liberals did suspect that the Princetonians were at heart merely conservatives who really didn't care about anything except the bonus issue. This, to a considerable extent, was right. At Princeton the emphasis was upon the joke, the satire, the bonus. But not always, and not exclusively. Dean Christian Gauss, who had origi\u00ad nally lent only grudging support, sensed this when he wrote a critic of the Future Veterans that the move\u00ad ment \"was founded partly in a spirit of high jinks and partly in a spirit of pro\u00ad test against the glorification of war.\" Later on, Gauss mused that the Future Veterans \"might have consequences that no one can yet see and that it dem\u00ad onstrates the determination of youth to rebuild the disordered world of their fathers a little closer to sanity.\" The liberal, anti-war note was most evident at Princeton toward the end. In June 1936 the national headquarters adopted a resolution calling upon Con\u00ad gress to declare that the United States would not enter a foreign war except by majority vote of the residents of three- fourths of the States of the Union. In spirit and language this resolution paralleled the then pending Ludlow Amendment, which in 1937 barely failed of passage in the House of Repre\u00ad sentatives. Future Veteran activity had peaked by the close of the academic year. After the summer vacation the treasury was bare, the joke was stale, and national attention was focused on the Roose- velt-Landon campaign. The Princeton\u00ad ians gamely issued a few proclamations and sent questionnaires to the presi\u00ad dential candidates about the bonus\u2014 and also about conscription and war\u00ad time controls over capital. But it was clear that the last golden egg had been laid. Operations were suspended in the fall, and in April 1937, with the treas\u00ad ury showing a deficit of forty-four cents, the Veterans of Future Wars closed their books forever. One last note. Except for one student who was hurt in an automobile acci\u00ad dent, every one of the Princetonians who founded the Veterans of Future Wars served in the armed forces of the United States in World War II. Richard D. Challener Vice-President was the title accorded several persons serving as acting presi\u00ad dent during brief interregnums in the early years of the college, but the first vice-president in the usual sense was Samuel Stanhope Smith, son-in-law of President John Witherspoon, who was appointed in 1786 to act for the presi\u00ad dent when he was away from Princeton, as he frequently was, on af\u00ad fairs of state. This office was filled sporadically as a means of granting the president much-needed aid by: Samuel Stanhope Smith 1786-1795 Elijah Slack 1812-1817 Philip Lindsly 1817-1824 John Maclean 1829-1854 Two of these vice-presidents became presidents: Smith and Maclean. In modern times the duties dis\u00ad charged by the four vice-presidents listed above have been performed by deans (beginning in 1883), and more recently by provosts (beginning in 492 VICE-PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES 1966). Since 1939 the title vice- president has been associated with bus\u00ad iness rather than academic matters: Financial Vice-President George Brakeley Carl W. Schafer (1976- ) (These 1953; Development Henry E. Bessire '57 ) Vice-President for Public Affairs (1970-1978) Robert K. Durkee '69 (1978- ) Affairs Anthony J. Maruca '54 (1972- ) Vice-President for Facilities John P. Moran '51 (1973- ) Vice-Presidents of the United States who attended Princeton are: Aaron Burr A.B. 1772 (N.Y.) 1801-1805 1810 (Pa.) 1845-1849 Viner, Jacob (1892-1970), third Walker Professor of Economics and Interna\u00ad tional Finance, was one of the ablest economists of his generation, and \"in the range and depth of insight and erudition,\" according to the British economist Lionel C. Robbins, \"the out\u00ad standing all-rounder of his time in our profession.\" His primary interests were in international economics, economic theory, and the history of economic thought, but his influence pervaded all areas of economics and spread to the fields of history, philosophy, literature, and religion. President Bowen, who was one of his students, called him \"one of the great Renaissance scholars of the world.\" Born in Montreal, Canada, of Ruma\u00ad nian immigrant parents (he later be\u00ad came a naturalized citizen of the United States), he graduated in 1914 from McGiIl, where Stephen Leacock was one of his teachers, and received his Ph.D. in 1922 from Harvard, where he was a pupil and became a close friend of Professor Frank Taussig. He became an instructor at the Uni\u00ad versity of Chicago in 1916 and was promoted to full professor in 1925, at the age of thirty-two. Chicago had a remarkably brilliant group of econo\u00ad mists in those years; according to Simeon E. Leland, his first graduate student and later his colleague, \"the brightest star in this galaxy was Viner . . . the most industrious and the toughest teacher of the lot.\" Viner's first book was Dumping (1923); when a dowager asked him why anyone would write a book on that sub\u00ad ject, his reply was the subtitle: \"A Prob\u00ad lem in International Trade.\" His sec\u00ad ond book, Canada's Balance of Inter\u00ad national Indebtedness (1924), was his doctoral dissertation; a pioneering work, it set the style for a highly pro\u00ad ductive series of studies in the working of international financial mechanisms. His Studies in the Theory of Interna\u00ad tional Trade (1937), was, Robbins said, \"at once the main source of historical knowledge regarding the evolution of thought in this sphere and a work in which some of his main theoretical de\u00ad velopments play a pivotal part.\" During his eighteen years as editor of the Jour\u00ad nal of Political Economy, he brought that journal to the peak of its distinc\u00ad tion. JACOB VINER 493 Viner frequently interrupted his aca\u00ad demic work to serve as an adviser to the government and as a delegate to many international conferences. During the First World War, he was associated with the United States Tariff Commis\u00ad sion and the Shipping Board. In the thirties he was an adviser to the Treas\u00ad ury Department, participating in the original planning of the Social Security Program. He was later a consultant to the State Department and to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Viner made several close friends in other countries, among them, Lionel Robbins, who has described their first encounter at Oxford in 1927 and \"the impression he at once made\u2014the short alert figure with his candid and pene\u00ad trating eyes, now brimming over with fun, now sober with deep reflection, his quick wit, his delight in argument and the general sense of intellectual vitality that informed even his casual remarks.\" Later Robbins discovered other qual\u00ad ities: Viner's scrupulousness, his can\u00ad dor, his catholic outlook, his \"zest for the exchange of ideas and the pursuit of the thought wherever it led him which made any session with him an exciting and strenuous adventure.\" Robbins said of Viner what Dr. Johnson said of Edmund Burke: \"That man calls forth all my powers.\" THE PIUNCETON YEARS In 1946, after serving for thirty years as a member of the faculty of the Uni\u00ad versity of Chicago, Viner accepted President Dodds's invitation to come to Princeton, where he made a remark\u00ad able contribution to the intellectual life of the University for almost twenty-five years. His insight and erudition delighted his Princeton colleagues. Time and again, Professor William Baumol re\u00adcalled, Viner would pose propositions to him \"involving complex tions arrived at by some inexplicable in\u00ad tuitive process.\" Occasionally, Baumol would argue with him that his proposi\u00ad tions were obviously incorrect, but al\u00ad ways it turned out that Viner had been right. \"Sometimes it took me days of painstaking calculation to arrive at his result,\" said Baumol, \"but I can re\u00ad member no case in which the mathe\u00ad matics failed to support his assertion.\" His reputation as a tough teacher continued. Graduate students knew that in doctoral examinations his would be the most difficult questions, Baumol recalled, but what they did not know was that afterward his would be the most generous marks proposed\u2014and usually adopted. Once a colleague asked Viner how he could possibly pro\u00ad pose such a good grade for a student who had failed completely to answer what Viner had asked him. With a play\u00ad ful gleam in his eyes, Viner replied \"Surely no one could reasonably have been expected to answer that ques\u00ad tion. \" A familiar figure in Firestone Li\u00ad brary, Viner exercised a lively influ\u00ad ence on its other users. \"No one,\" the University Librarian, William S. Dix, said, \"could measure the value of his in\u00ad formal teaching as he stood near the catalogue or in the stacks talking with a graduate student or a colleague . . . teaching by example the pleasure and the integrity of sound scholarship.\" An expert bibliographer and an inveterate reader of booksellers' catalogues, he de\u00ad lighted in discovering obscure but use\u00ad ful books and pamphlets which he ac\u00ad quired and gave to the University li\u00ad brary, with meticulous notes on their bibliographical significance. He also contributed his tough- mindedness and his infectious humor to the affairs of the University Press as a 494 JACOB VINER member of its editorial board and as a trustee. Under his influence standards and procedures were established for the publication of scholarly books that have helped set the Press's guidelines ever since. Remarking on Viner's influ\u00ad ence, Herbert S. Bailey, Jr., Director of the Press, spoke of the \"witty seri\u00ad ousness\" that was characteristic of ev\u00ad erything he rarely told a joke,\" Bailey recalled, \"but conversa\u00ad tions him were filled with laugh\u00ad ter. . . Even on the most serious occa\u00ad sions when he was righteously aroused by some scholar's carelessness or in\u00ad fidelity, a flash of wit could suddenly turn everything to smiles\u2014though the carelessness or infidelity was not ex\u00ad cused. \" HIS \"MODEST PROPOSAL\" Viner's wit as well as his humanistic approach to learning are illustrated in an address delivered at Brown Univer\u00ad sity in 1950, entitled \"A Modest Pro\u00ad posal for Some Stress on Scholarship in Graduate Training.\" His \"modest pro\u00ad posal\" was that graduate schools should assume more responsibility than they ordinarily do for scholarship as distinct from research. Although he admitted that graduate students could not become \"finished scholars as well as finished economists\" in the short time available to them, he pointed out that graduate study is fol\u00ad lowed by another stage in education \"lasting to the end of one's life.\" He suggested, therefore, that doctoral de\u00ad grees should be granted, and accepted, somewhat in the spirit in which the University of Avignon handled the case of a capable but negligent candidate in 1650; \"after some hesitation it con\u00ad hope of future study.' \" He did not plead on behalf of scholarship that it would save the world (\"although this had conceivably hap\u00ad pened in the past and might happen again\") or that it would bring material rewards to the scholar or that it was an invariably exciting activity. All that he would plead, at least on this occasion, he said, was that once the taste for it has been aroused, it gives a sense of largeness even to one's small quests, and a sense of fullness even to the small answers to problems large or small which it yields, a sense which can never in any other way be attained, for which no other source of human gratifica\u00ad tion can, to the addict, be a satisfying substitute, which gains instead of loses in quality and quantity and in pleasure-yielding capacity by being shared with others\u2014and which, un\u00ad like golf, improves with age. Viner's ground-breaking study of The Customs Union Issue appeared in 1950, his essays on International Economics in 1951, and his lectures at the National University of Brazil, International Trade and Economic Development, in 1952. In 1957, on his sixty-fifth birth\u00ad day, his students and friends brought out a selection of his writings, entitled The Long View and the Short. In 1960 Viner nominally retired, but despite his reply to an old friend who asked what he was doing now\u2014 \"basking amid the laurels of my students\"\u2014he continued to spend most of his time in Firestone Library, \"pur\u00ad suing with concentrated intensity at once the detail of how the subject of his study actually happened and what its significance was in the broad evolution of thought and affairs.\" In 1962 he was awarded the Francis A. Walker Medal, presented by the JOHN VON NEUMANN 495 American Economic Association once every five years to an economist who has made a contribution of the highest distinction to economics. In presenting this award, Fritz Machlup, Viner's suc\u00ad cessor as Walker Professor, said that in all the fields to which Viner had con\u00ad tributed, he would be remembered as \"a deflator of pretentious nonsense as well as an original creator.\" What all of his colleagues might learn from him, Machlup added, was \"intellectual hon\u00ad esty and fearlessness,\" with \"a will\u00ad ingness to stand firm on the unpopular side of any issue, theoretical or practi\u00ad cal, whether that side be 'radical' or 'conservative,' 'newfangled' or 'old- fashioned.' \" During his retirement he spent a year at Harvard as Taussig Research Professor, wrote a monograph on mon\u00ad etary control and another on Adam Smith, and gave the Jayne Memorial Lectures of the American Philosophical Society on \"The Role of Providence in the Social Order.\" Viner was a permanent member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and an honorary fellow of the London School of Economics. Presi\u00ad dent of the American Economic Associ\u00ad ation in 1939, he was also a fellow or member of a number of honorary academies in the United States as well as in Great Britain, Sweden, and Italy. He received honorary degrees from thirteen American and foreign univer\u00ad sities including Princeton. \"A deep love of justice and liberty and a profound sense of compassion\" were for Viner \"the underlying justifi\u00ad cations for thought and public action,\" Lionel Robbins wrote in his final trib\u00ad ute: Jack was not a believer in any or\u00ad thodox creed. But he believed pas\u00adsionately in the liberal values: equal\u00ad ity before the law, the maximum freedom for the individual compati\u00ad ble with similar privileges for his fel\u00ad lows, sympathy and help for the un\u00ad fortunate. Nothing stirred him to anger more than an infringement of these norms, nothing more aroused his contempt than bogus substitutes for them. . . . He did not believe that life on this planet was likely to be\u00ad come perfect. But he believed that, with forethought, it could be made less imperfect than it is. von Neumann, John (1903-1957), world-famous mathematician who was professor of mathematical physics in the University and later a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study, was born on December 28, 1903, the son of a well-to-do banker in Budapest, Hungary. From the age of thirteen he showed a pronounced interest in math\u00ad ematics, which was fostered by his teachers at the Lutheran High School of Budapest where Princeton's Nobel laureate physicist Eugene Wigner was also a student. After graduation from high school, von Neumann studied chemistry for two years in Berlin and for two years in Zurich but spent much of his time with mathematicians, taking a Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Budapest not long after receiving his chemistry diploma at Zurich. Thereaf\u00ad ter, he concentrated on mathematics and theoretical physics in further study at Gottingen and Hamburg and after 1927 as a privatdozent in Berlin. In 1929 von Neumann accepted an invitation to come to Princeton as a vis\u00ad iting professor for one term. Given a continuing half-time appointment the following year, he spent one term each year in Princeton and one in Germany 496 JOHN VON NEUMANN until 1933 when, at the age of 30, he ac\u00ad cepted appointment as the youngest and one of the first professors in the newly founded Institute for Advanced Study. In 1937 he became a United States citizen. Von Neumann's brilliant work in mathematics also carried him into theo\u00ad retical economics and technology as well as theoretical physics\u2014areas where he was able to make vital contri\u00ad butions not only to science but also to the welfare of his adopted country. His work in quantum mechanics gave him a profound knowledge concerning the application of nuclear energy to mili\u00ad tary and peacetime uses, enabling him to occupy an important place in the sci\u00ad entific councils of the nation. During the Second World War, he played a major role among the Los Alamos group of scientists who developed the atomic bomb. After the war he served on the advisory committee of the Atomic Energy Commission and on the commission itself from 1954 until his death. In collaboration with the University's Class of 1913 Professor of Political Economy, Oskar Morgenstern, he de\u00ad veloped further the interest in game theory he had first evidenced in a treatise published in 1928. Their joint endeavors resulted in Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (published by Princeton University Press in 1944), which aimed to demonstrate that \"the typical problems of economic behavior become strictly identical with the mathematical notions of suitable games of strategy.\" The theory was also con\u00ad sidered of value for the study of gov\u00ad ernment and sociology and for its appli\u00ad cation to problems of military strategy by the United States. Probably the best known and most dramatic of von Neumann's ac\u00ad complishments was his development of one of the speediest, most accurate, and most useful computers, which made the essential calculations that en\u00ad abled the United States to build and test its first full model of the hydrogen bomb. Another computer he later de\u00ad veloped enabled the Navy to do twenty-four-hour weather predictions in a few minutes and helped the armed forces plan the movement of men and material by mathematically simulating logistic problems Von Neumann received many honors for his contributions to science and to the nation. In 1937, when he was 34, he won the American Mathematical Soci\u00ad ety's highest award, the Bocher Prize, and soon thereafter, at a comparatively early age, was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Sci\u00ad ences, and a foreign member of scien\u00ad tific academies in Amsterdam, Lima, Milan, and Rome. In 1947 he was awarded the Presidential Medal for Merit and the Navy Distinguished Ci\u00ad vilian Service Award for his work during the Second World War. That same year he was one of a select group of scholars awarded Princeton honorary degrees at the concluding convocation of its Bicen\u00ad tennial Year; he was later honored by a number of other institutions, including Harvard and Pennsylvania. From 1951 to 1953 he was president of the Ameri\u00ad can Mathematical Society, and in 1956 he received three top honors: the Al\u00ad bert Einstein Commemorative Award, the $50,000 Enrico Fermi Award for his contributions to the design and con\u00ad struction of computing machines used in nuclear research and development, and the Medal of Freedom \"for excep-HOWARD CROSBY WARREN 497 tional meritorious service in promoting the scientific progress of this country's armament program.\" Analyzing the qualities of mind that made possible von Neumann's extraor\u00ad dinary contributions, Eugene Wigner emphasized the accuracy of his logic, his brilliance, and his exceptional memory. Observing that von Neumann was ever-ready to help and was genuinely interested in every problem that presented a challenge, Professor Wigner said that he himself had learned more mathematics from von Neumann than anyone else and much more about the \"essence of creative thinking in mathematics\" than a lifetime's study without von Neumann could have taught him. Professor Wigner also quoted Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Lewis L. Strauss's comment on von Neumann: \"If he analyzed a problem, it was not necessary to discuss it any further. It was clear what had to be done.\" In the summer of 1955, only a few months after his appointment to the Atomic Energy Commission, von Neumann became ill with what was soon diagnosed as cancer. His last pub\u00ad lic appearance came early in 1956 when, in a wheel-chair at the White House, he received the Medal of Free\u00ad dom from President Eisenhower. That April he was taken to Walter Reed Hospital where he died on February 8, 1957. In a memoir written for the Ameri\u00ad can Philosophical Society, Professor Eugene Wigner, von Neumann's close friend since their high school days in Budapest, declared: \"His accomplish\u00ad ments were manifold, his was a great mind\u2014perhaps one of the greatest of the first half of this century.\" A tribute from President Eisenhower cited the \"rare and great gifts of mind\" von Neumann had given \"for the defense of his adopted land and the cause of free\u00ad dom.\" Warren, Howard Crosby (1867-1934), first chairman of the Psychology De\u00ad partment, was badly burned by a lamp when eighteen months old, and suf\u00ad fered great pain from a succession of operations during the first five years of his childhood. As a result of this ordeal, he developed powers of endurance and emotional restraint that remained dom\u00ad inant traits of his personality. Although he carried through life deep facial scars and a useless hand and eye, there were apparently no emotional scars\u2014in his autobiography he said his early life was \"the story of a happy childhood, a pleasant home life, and congenial playmates.\" His family was financially able to give him every assistance in coping with his early handicap (and later to leave him a substantial inheritance, which he used with characteristically self-effacing generosity to advance the science of psychology). Although brought up in a puritanically religious household, he developed at an early age a skepticism toward conventional beliefs and expla\u00ad nations, which in college ripened into a revolt against religious mysticism and a belief in a deterministic interpretation of mental processes. He prepared for college under a pri\u00ad vate tutor, graduated from Princeton in 1889, and received an A.M. two years later. In 1893, after advanced study in Leipzig, Berlin, and Munich, he be\u00ad came a demonstrator in Princeton's new psychological laboratory in Nassau Hall. His advance was rapid: he be\u00ad came professor in 1902, director of the laboratory in 1904, and Stuart Professor 498 GEORGE WASHINGTON of Psychology in 1914. He worked with persistence toward the formal separa\u00ad tion of psychology and philosophy, and in 1920 became the first chairman of a separate department of psychology. Through his efforts and with his finan\u00ad cial help, Eno Hall, a building devoted entirely to psychology, was erected in 1924. Warren was profoundly honest and deeply scornful of insincerity and van\u00ad ity; he also had a fine sense of humor. These qualities were in evidence when in 1916, two years after his appoint\u00ad ment to the Stuart Professorship, he became a candidate for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Johns Hopkins University. He had not bothered to take a degree at the normal time in his career and now concluded that it was not proper for him to examine Ph.D. candidates without having the degree himself. He spent the entire academic year 1916-17 in residence at Hopkins, where he gave lectures instead of at\u00ad tending them, presented a thesis, and successfully completed the final oral examinations in which, one observer said, \"one could not tell who was the examiner and who was the candidate.\" He thus earned his Ph.D. three years after the completion of his term as pres\u00ad ident of the American Psychological As\u00ad sociation. Toward the end of his life Warren was threatened with total blindness; \"it will be an interesting psychological ex\u00ad periment,\" he told a colleague, \"to find out what personal adjustments I shall have to make.\" He patiently carried on the work of compiling a dictionary of psychology, with which he had been occupied for a decade, and pushed it almost to completion, even though he could see the print only with the greatest difficulty. He left the manu\u00ad script, and $5,000 for editorial ex\u00adpenses, to the trustees of Princeton, and the dictionary was published post\u00ad humously, \"a memorial,\" his faculty colleagues said, scholarship and . . . supreme courage.\" He also left to Princeton his exten\u00ad sive psychological library; it is housed in Green Hall, which replaced Eno Hall as the home of psychology in 1963. In his honor the Society of Experi\u00ad mental Psychologists, which he helped found, annually awards to one of its members the Howard Crosby Warren Medal. Washington, George, made two memorable visits to Princeton. The first took place in 1777 when, ten days after crossing the Delaware on Christmas night and defeating the British at Tren\u00ad ton, he made the early morning sur\u00ad prise attack that drove the British from Nassau Hall and sent them in retreat from Princeton. The second visit oc\u00ad curred in 1783, in the closing days of the war, when he came here at the re\u00ad quest of the Continental Congress, which had fled from Philadelphia to avoid mutinous troops and was meeting in Nassau Hall. Since no suitable house could be found for Washington in the village of Princeton, \"Rockingham\" was rented for him at Rocky Hill, four miles dis\u00ad tant. Here he arrived late in August and stayed until November. He be\u00ad came a familiar figure in Princeton and was a frequent visitor to Nassau Hall where he conferred with the committee of Congress on peace establishment. In August, at a formal audience of Congress in Nassau Hall, he received the thanks of his countrymen for his conduct of the war. That September he attended the College's Commence\u00ad ment in the First Presbyterian Church in company with the members of Con-WATER POLO 499 gress who, as a compliment to the Col\u00ad lege, had adjourned their meetings so that they might attend. Ashbel Green (later president of the College), deliv\u00ad ered the valedictory oration, observing that \"there had never been such an au\u00ad dience at a Commencement before, and perhaps, there never will be again.\" He concluded with this tribute to Washington: Some future bard . . . shall tell in all the majesty of epic song, of the man whose prudent conduct, and whose gallant sword, taught the ty\u00ad rants of the earth to fear oppression, and opened an asylum for the virtu\u00ad ous and free to all the world. The trustees met immediately after the Commencement exercises. Their only business was the adoption of the following resolution: The Board being desirous to give some testimony of their high respect for the character of his Excellency General Washington, who has so auspiciously conducted the armies of America, Resolved, That the Rev. Drs. Witherspoon, Rodgers, and Johnes be a committee to wait upon his Ex\u00ad cellency to request him to sit for a picture, to be taken by Mr. Charles Wilson Peale, of Philadelphia. And that this portrait be placed in the Hall of the College, in the room of the picture of the late King of Great Britain [George the Second], which was torn away by a ball from the American artillery in the battle of Princeton. At a meeting on the following day President Witherspoon reported to the board that \"his Excellency General Washington had delivered to him fifty guineas . . . as a testimony of his re\u00adspect for the College.\" The board thereupon resolved to direct the com\u00ad mittee it had appointed to solicit his portrait, to present to him at the same time \"the thanks of the Board for . . . his politeness and generosity.\" Washington consented to the por\u00ad trait, which was completed in time for presentation at Commencement the following year. It depicts Washington with uplifted sword at the battle of Princeton, at his side the mortally wounded General Hugh Mercer, a sur\u00ad geon, and another officer bearing an American flag, with Nassau Hall in the distance. The portrait has escaped two fires and today hangs in the Faculty Room on the right side of the presi\u00ad dent's chair. It is one of the University's finest paintings and one of its proudest possessions. Washington continued to maintain his respect for Princeton, sending his ward, George Washington Parke Cus- tis, to study here in 1796 under Presi\u00ad dent S. Stanhope Smith. In a letter to Custis in 1797, Washington cautioned him against letting his former tutor, Zechariah Lewis, divert him from the course recommended by President Smith: Mr. Lewis [Washington wrote] was educated at Yale College, and, as is natural, may be prejudiced in favor of the mode pursued at that semi\u00ad nary; but no college has turned out better scholars or more estimable characters than Nassau. Water Polo was played at Princeton be\u00ad fore packed galleries from 1907 to 1930. It was a rugged game, with no holds barred (no one, except those involved, ever knew what went on under water), but there were those who loved it. Ar\u00ad chibald MacLeish, the poet, played 500 THOMAS JEFFERSON WERTENBAKER right forward on the Yale team that suf\u00ad fered its only loss to Princeton in 1914. Ably coached by Frank Sullivan, Princeton teams won championships in the water polo league of the Intercol\u00ad legiate Swimming Association in ten of the twenty-three seasons in which they participated: 1912 through 1917; 1919; 1921 through 1923. Princeton did not lose a single game in any of these years. The 1912 and 1913 teams added to their laurels by post-season victories over the University of Illinois, intercollegiate champions of the West. The 1916 team was exceptionally strong defensively: it permitted its opponents only 12 points\u2014against its own 335\u2014during the entire season. The 1917 team was outstanding on oflFense, scoring a total of 370 points, a league record. Herbert W. Warden, Jr. '18 led in scoring with 230 points in 1916, and 210 in 1917. Some other outstanding players were Goulding K. Wight '13, Robert L. Nourse, Jr. '17, RobertC.Tait'22, Fred M. Phillips '23, Henry M. Matalene, Jr. '26. In February 1930, the Faculty Committee on Athletics announced that 19 of the 23 members of the varsity squad and 14 of the 17 members of the freshman squad were suffering from ear injuries or nose and throat infections and that water polo would be discon\u00ad tinued for the rest of the season. Later, on recommendation of the medical staff, the committee announced the abolition of the sport at Princeton. Since then, water polo has been re\u00ad vived informally several times under revised rules that have sought to make the game less hazardous. Wertenbaker, Thomas Jefiferson (1879-1966), second Edwards Professor of American History, was born in Char\u00adlottesville and took his bachelor's and his doctor's degrees at the University of Virginia, where his grandfather, ap\u00ad pointed librarian by Thomas Jefferson, had served for half a century. He made his reputation with his doc\u00ad toral thesis, Patrician and Plebeian in Virginia, which he followed with his Virginia under the Stuarts, and his master work The Phnters of Colonial Virginia. In all of these, his student and colleague Joseph R. Strayer has writ\u00ad ten, \"he showed the same complete honesty, historical insight, and ap\u00ad preciation of the role of the common man in our early history.\" Brought to Princeton as a preceptor by Woodrow Wilson in 1910, Werten\u00ad baker was a member of the History Department for thirty-seven years and its chairman from 1928 to 1936. He en\u00ad couraged good undergraduate teaching; his own course on Colonial American history, familiarly known as \"House and Garden,\" was a student favorite. He was a popular preceptor among un\u00ad dergraduates and in great demand for \"alumni preceptorials.\" For many years he carried, with Dana C. Munro, the major burden of graduate instruction in history and strove to advance the scholarly reputation of the department. His three volumes on The Founding of American Civilization \"added new dimensions of social and cultural his\u00ad tory to what had been the standard economic-political treatment of the co\u00ad lonial period.\" His other works include a general history of the American people, and a history of Princeton's first one hundred and fifty years, written for the University's Bicentennial in 1946. Wertenbaker was president of the American Historical Association and a member of the American Philosophical Society. He was twice appointed Harmsworth Professor of American ANDREW FLEMING WEST 501 History at Oxford and was a visiting professor at the University of Gotting- en. Even in retirement he continued to receive important appointments, e.g., as visiting professor at the Univer\u00ad sity of Munich, Thomas Jefferson Re\u00ad search Fellow at the University of Vir\u00ad ginia, and John Hay Whitney Professor at Hampden-Sydney College. Besides being one of the leading his\u00ad torians of his time, Wertenbaker was also a newspaper editor and an amateur architect; he designed his own home in Princeton, enclosing the garden with a serpentine wall modeled after Jeffer\u00ad son's at the University of Virginia. A courtly gentleman and scholar, he en\u00ad deared himself to generations of stu\u00ad dents and colleagues. He was even- tempered in argument with his as\u00ad sociates and went out of his way to be helpful to younger men. \"In character and versatility,\" his faculty colleagues declared in their memorial minute, \"he was a worthy representative of his be\u00ad loved Golden Age of Virginia.\" When he died, his friends estab\u00ad lished the Thomas Jefferson Werten\u00ad baker Memorial Fund for the purchase of University Library books in Ameri\u00ad can colonial history. West, Andrew Fleming (1853-1943), first dean of the Graduate School, was born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania on May 17, 1853. He entered Princeton in 1870, but soon withdrew because of poor health and for two years attended Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, where his father was a professor in the Danville Theological Seminary. He re\u00ad turned to Princeton in 1872, graduating in the Class of 1874. After college, he taught high school Latin in Cincinnati for six years and, following a period of study in Europe, served for two years as principal of the Morris Academy in Morristown, New Jersey. In 1883 he was called to Princeton by President McCosh to fill the newly founded Giger chair in Latin. Early in his career he published a book about the teacher of Charlemagne, Alcuin and the Rise of Christian Schools, and a Latin grammar he hoped would lead secondary school students \"without too many scratches\" through what Alcuin had called \"the thorny thickets of grammatical density.\" He was presi\u00ad dent of the American Philological Asso\u00ad ciation, a trustee of the American Academy in Rome, one of the founders of the American School of Classical Studies in Rome, and the principal founder of the American Classical League, which he organized in an effort to stem the decline of interest in the classics\u2014in his view, \"the gold stand\u00ad ard of education.\" The organizing and fund-raising tal\u00ad ents West used in his efforts on behalf of the classics, also found dramatic ex\u00ad pression in the University's highly suc\u00ad cessful sesquicentennial celebration in 1896. As secretary of the committee in charge of the celebration, he organized a splendid three-day affair, including a distinguished program of public lec\u00ad tures by visiting scholars from abroad that set a pattern for other, later uni\u00ad versity celebrations, and a spectacular torchlight procession of 2,000 gaily cos\u00ad tumed alumni that stimulated the de\u00ad velopment of the most colorful event of the annual Commencement season\u2014 the alumni parade. West also helped to obtain President Cleveland's participation in the cele\u00ad bration, and after his second term as president, Cleveland moved to Prince\u00ad ton, naming the house and grounds that West found for him \"Westland.\" On his election as a University trustee, Cleve-502 ANDREW FLEMING WEST land became chairman of the trustees' committee on the graduate school and West's strong supporter. As secretary of the committee that sought gifts in connection with the ses- quicentennial celebration, West played a significant role in the raising of funds for endowment and for a library and three dormitories (\"Here's to Andy three million West,\" the seniors sang, \"At gathering money he is the best\"); he was also largely responsible for in\u00ad troducing collegiate gothic architecture at Princeton, communicating his en\u00ad thusiasm for the gothic of Oxford and Cambridge to M. Taylor Pyne and other donors and\u2014through Pyne's in\u00ad fluence as chairman of the grounds and buildings committee\u2014to other mem\u00ad bers of the board of trustees. With his appointment in December 1900 as first dean of the graduate school, West devoted his energy and talents to the development of the school and particularly to the creation of a residential graduate college. He wanted Princeton to lead the way in providing adequate residences for American graduate students. In the spring of 1903, after visiting Oxford, Cambridge, and other universities in Britain and on the continent, he out\u00ad lined his proposal for a residential col\u00ad lege in a handsomely illustrated book, which he proceeded to use, with great effectiveness, in raising funds for this project. One of the first results of his ef\u00ad fort was a $275,000 bequest left in the spring of 1906 by Mrs. Josephine Thomson Swann, of Princeton, for a graduate college in memory of her first husband, United States Senator Robert S. Thomson, of the Class of 1817. The Swann bequest brought to light a disagreement between West and President Wilson regarding the loca\u00ad tion of the graduate college that marked the onset of the great controversy be\u00ad tween these two strong and stubborn sons of Presbyterian ministers. From the beginning, Wilson had wanted the graduate college \"at the heart\" of the University as \"a means of vitalizing the whole intellectual life\" of the place. West appeared to be in agreement at first: in his book, he spoke of the influ\u00ad ence the proposed graduate college would have on \"every undergraduate who passes it in his daily walks.\" How\u00ad ever, as his plans developed, he settled on a location geographically separate from the main campus, where, as he put it, the graduate college would be free from the distractions of under\u00ad graduate life, and thus able to develop \"its own true life.\" West's position was greatly strength\u00ad ened in the fall of 1906 when he re\u00ad ceived an invitation to the presidency of Massachusetts Institute of Technol\u00ad ogy. What his loss would mean to Princeton was widely discussed in the nation's press as well as in the Princetonian and the Alumni Weekly. After the adoption of a trustees' resolu\u00ad tion (drafted by Wilson) declaring that the board would consider his loss \"quite irreparable\" because it had \"par\u00ad ticularly counted upon him to put into operation the Graduate College which he conceived and for which it has planned,\" West finally declined the in\u00ad vitation, and the New York Sun head\u00ad lined its announcemnt \"WEST WON'T GO.\" West suffered a setback in the spring of 1908, when the trustees voted to lo\u00ad cate the Thomson graduate college be\u00ad tween Prospect and Seventy-nine Hall. A year later, however, West's continu\u00ad ing efforts were rewarded by a letter he received from Procter and Gamble Company President William Cooper Procter 1883, whose wife had been a ANDREW FLEMING WEST 503 student of West's at the Hughes high school in Cincinnati. Procter offered the University $500,000 for the graduate college, provided the trustees raised an equal amount from other sources and selected some site other than the Prospect one. The stalemate that followed the Proc\u00ad ter offer ended abruptly in May of 1910 with the death in Salem, Mas\u00ad sachusetts, of Isaac C. Wyman 1848, a wealthy bachelor West had visited a number of years before, and sought to persuade to leave his money to Prince\u00ad ton for a graduate college to be built near where his father had fought in the Revolutionary battle of Princeton. From Salem, where he had gone for the funeral and probate of the will, West telegraphed President Wilson and Trustee M. Taylor Pyne (by then chairman of the graduate school com\u00ad mittee) that Wyman had left his re\u00ad siduary estate (estimated originally at upwards of $2 million but eventually realized at a little less than $800,000) for the purposes of the Graduate Col\u00ad lege and had named West as one of two executors and trustees. \"I laid a spray of ivy from Nassau Hall on Mr. Wyman's casket,\" West reported in a letter to Pyne describing the funeral, \"and I planted an ivy root from Nassau Hall at his grave.\" President Wilson having acknowl\u00ad edged defeat in the matter of location, the Board, on his recommendation, unanimously authorized acceptance of the Procter gift; it also voted to extend its thanks to West for his \"great services to the University\" in obtaining the Wyman bequest. Built on the north edge of the Uni\u00ad versity's golf links, half a mile from the main campus, its chief supporters re\u00ad membered by Thomson College, Proc\u00ad ter Hall, Wyman House, Pyne Tower, and Cleveland Tower, the graduate college was dedicated on October 22, 1913, with speeches by, among others, Dean West and ex-President Taft. Although his main ambition was now fulfilled, West continued to exercise his money-raising talent. When Henry Clay Frick, on being shown Procter Hall, observed that it \"looked too damn much like a church\u2014all it needs is an organ,\" West quickly persuaded him to give one. Nor was he discomfited by Edward W. Bok's comment that Princeton needed a memorial to Wood- row Wilson; he promptly exacted from Bok endowment for a Woodrow Wilson professorship. A large man (the undergraduate Fac\u00ad ulty Song described him as \"63 inches around the vest\") with an impressive voice, West was an unforgettable per\u00ad sonage. A wit and a satirist, he de\u00ad lighted in epigrams and limericks. He also took special pleasure in writing the honorary degree citations, and was al\u00ad ways ready to respond to a request for an elegant inscription for a new build\u00ad ing. He enjoyed dining out, fine food, good conversation, a good cigar, a good detective story, and a good joke. West retired in 1928 after forty-five years as Giger professor of Latin and twenty-seven as dean of the graduate school. Classicist Edward Capps, who had been called from the University of Chicago by Wilson and had been one of his strongest partisans, wrote to West: \"You are entited to reflect, as few of us are, that you have seen most of your dreams come true. The Graduate School and the Graduate College are your sole creations, and they are splen\u00ad did.\" At the same time, the university conferred on West an honorary doctor of letters, and the Daily Princetonian issued a 32-page special edition to re\u00ad count his achievements. A few months 504 WEST COLLEGE earlier, R. Tait McKenzie's bronze statue of him, given by William Cooper Procter, had been erected in the main quadrangle of the Graduate College and a small house was completed next to Wyman House for his use the rest of his life. In his retirement years, he recom\u00ad mended Princeton as \"a good place to grow old in\" to members of the Nassau Club, when they gave him a dinner on his eighty-first birthday, learned with satisfaction of the endowment by the Carnegie Corporation and anonymous donors of The Andrew Fleming West chair in classics, and, with the help of President Dodds, who went to see him at his request, planned his funeral. After \"some bantering back and forth and a considerable amount of laugh\u00ad ter,\" they outlined a full service and left copies at the office and home of the president and the dean of the graduate school\u2014West \"had never been prone to leave things at loose ends,\" Mr. Dodds later recalled, \"and his funeral was to be no exception.\" He died on December 27, 1943, and the funeral service\u2014as planned\u2014was held in the University Chapel three days later. A faculty memorial minute lauded West's \"vision, wisdom, and tenacity of purpose,\" his \"keen understanding of human nature,\" his \"powers of persua\u00ad sion,\" and his \"genius for strong and enduring friendships.\" John D. Davies West College, built in 1836, probably from the plans of John Notman, was Princeton's second dormitory. The first was East College (q.v.). West College was remodeled in 1925-1926 by Aymar Embury 1900, who removed a mansard roof that had been added about 1870, restoring the original Colonial roof line. He also added the second-floor balcony along the front, redesigned the two main entrances, and built a new addi\u00ad tion in the rear. Except for the ground floor, which was once occupied by the University Store, West continued to serve as a dormitory until 1964 when its interior was converted for use by deans and other officers concerned with the academic administration of the under\u00ad graduate college. Whig-Cliosophic Society, The Ameri\u00ad can, is the oldest college literary and debating club in the United States. Originally two separate groups, Whig and Clio (as they have been known commonly for most of their history) grew out of two earlier student societies, the Plain Dealing Club (Whig) and the Well Meaning Club (Clio), founded about 1765 to promote literary and debating activities. Similar groups had appeared in other American colleges during the eighteenth century; most of them had been short-lived. Such was the fate of the Plain Dealing and Well Meaning Clubs; conflicts be\u00ad tween the two groups led to their sup\u00ad pression in March 1769. Command of the subtler uses of the written and spoken word was a major instrument of professional and political success in the eighteenth as well as in the nineteenth century. Under\u00ad graduate interest in literary and debat\u00ad ing activities, therefore, did not end with the dissolution of the clubs. The prime agent in their revival appears to have been William Paterson, later gov\u00ad ernor of New Jersey. After graduation in 1763, Paterson remained in Princeton to study law. During these years he maintained close contact with students, encouraging their more con\u00ad structive activities. It seems to have THE AMERICAN WHIG-CLIOSOPHIC SOCIETY 505 been Paterson, along with a few other alumni, who persuaded the new pres\u00ad ident, John Witherspoon, to permit the formation of successors to the Plain Dealing and Well Meaning Clubs. The American Whig Society was born on June 24, 1769, and the Cliosophic Society on June 7, 1770. The name \"American Whig\" derived from a recent series of essays by a new trustee of the College, William Livingston, shortly to become first gov\u00ad ernor of the state of New Jersey. It sig\u00ad nified adherence to ancient principles of British political and religious dissent, principles that later found concrete form in the Revolution and in the founding of the American Republic. The adjective \"Cliosophic\" seems to have been invented by Paterson. Sig\u00ad nifying \"in praise of wisdom,\" it bears no relation to the muse of history. The years immediately preceding the Revolution were active ones for the societies. They afforded an arena in which many future leaders of the Re\u00ad public, such as James Madison (Whig) and Aaron Burr (Clio) developed and sharpened the skills of persuasion, ex\u00ad position, and cooperation (and conflict) with peers. The disruptions caused by the Revo\u00ad lutionary War brought a hiatus in the societies' activities. Revived in 1781, they then entered their period of greatest influence and usefulness, one that extended to the 1880s. Housed at first in two small chambers in Nassau Hall, in 1805 Whig and Clio moved into more spacious apartments on the sec\u00ad ond floor of newly constructed Stanhope Hall. By the 1830s the societies had outgrown these rooms. They then constructed handsome wooden neo-classical halls for their own exclusive use, which were completed in 1838. The present marble halls, opened in 1893, are greatly enlarged copies of the buldings of the 1830s. Whig and Clio, like similar literary societies at other American colleges, were the main focus of undergraduate life for much of the nineteenth century. Elaborately organized, self-governing youth groups (though often receiving advice from alumni and faculty), they were, in effect, colleges within col\u00ad leges. They constructed and taught their own curricula, selected and bought their own books, operated their own libraries (often larger and more ac\u00ad cessible than that of the college itself), and developed and enforced elaborate codes of conduct among their mem\u00ad bers. Intense competition for members and for college honors led to creative emulation between the two societies. Their libraries afforded undergraduates easy access to the world outside; their debates trained generations to consider the great public issues of the day, from slavery to American expansion, from women's rights to the dismemberment of the union. Surviving the challenge of Greek letter fraternities in the 1850s and 1860s, the societies reached their apogee in the 1880s. Then Princeton, like many other old American colleges, underwent a rapid transformation. It became a university college. In the process enrollment increased enor\u00ad mously, while a network of social clubs, expanded library facilities, and a wid\u00ad ened curriculum replaced many of the functions once performed by Whig and Clio. By the time of World War I, Whig and Clio were only two among the scores of student groups that appealed to a wide range of undergraduate intel\u00ad lectual, social, and physical interests. Dormant during World War I, when the societies were revived in the early 1920s they faced a student generation largely indifferent to their traditional 506 WHIG HALL concerns. In an effort to attract inter\u00ad est, in 1925 the Polity, Law and Fine Arts Clubs, along with the Speaker's Association, were absorbed into the Halls. However, interest continued to decline; in 1928 the two societies merged and moved into Whig Hall. In 1941 Whig Hall and the assets of the society were transferred to the trustees of the University, with the understand\u00ad ing that the building and funds were to be \"used for purposes associated with undergraduate activities in the fields of public speaking, debate, conferences on public affairs, literature and jour\u00ad nalism.\" These were the main pursuits of the society over the succeeding three decades. In following them Whig-Clio sponsored successfully several sub\u00ad sidiary organizations, such as the Princeton Senate, the International Af\u00ad fairs Council, and the National Affairs Council. But from the 1930s on, Whig-Clio's most conspicuous public role was in bringing important public figures to speak on the campus. Some\u00ad times controversial, the speakers linked the undergraduates in a direct and per\u00ad sonal manner to the wider world be\u00ad yond Princeton. And, when Whig Hall was gutted by fire in November 1969, its speedy and strikingly innovative re\u00ad construction testified to widespread and continuing support for one of the older organizations in the United States. James McLachlan Whig Hall has been the home of the American Whig-Cliosophic Society, commonly known as Whig-Clio, since the merger of the American Whig and Cliosophic Societies in 1929. Whig Hall was built in 1893 at the same time as its twin, Clio Hall (q.v.). Both buildings were designed in marble by A. Page Brown in the Ionic style of a Greek temple, which had also been used for their stucco and wood predecessors, built in approximately the same loca\u00ad tions in 1838. After Whig was gutted by fire in November 1969, extensive reno\u00ad vations, including a modern treatment of the destroyed east wall, were de\u00ad signed by the firm of Gwathmey and Siegel and completed in 1972. Wilcox Hall is the nucleus of a group of buildings on the south campus that house Woodrow Wilson College (q.v.). It was completed in 1961 and named in honor of its donor, T. Ferdinand Wilcox '00, senior partner in a New York bank\u00ad ing and brokerage firm, who was an officer of his class and a member of the Alumni Council. It contains dining fa\u00ad cilities, lounges, conference rooms, overnight accommodations for guests, and a 12,000-book working library, named for Julian Street (q.v.). Wilder, Thornton [Niven] 1897- 1975) came to Princeton frequently in the early 1920s to browse in the stacks of the old Pyne Library on evenings when he was off duty at Lawrenceville School, where he taught French and was a master of Davis House. He en\u00ad tered the Princeton Graduate School in the fall of 1925 and received an A. M. in Modern Languages here in June 1926. He had previously attended Oberlin and Yale, where he received his A. B. in 1920. He got the idea for his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, The Bridge of San Luis Rey, \"on the winding walk from the golf club to the Graduate College.\" He began to write The Bridge in his rooms on the top floor of the eleventh entry of the Graduate College and fin\u00ad ished it in Davis House the following year while teaching again at Lawrence\u00ad ville. He left this area in 1928. A decade later, in 1938, his first play, Our RICHARD HERMAN WILHELM 507 Town, opened in McCarter Theatre. It won a Pulitzer Prize and became one of the most frequently produced plays in America. He won a third Pulitzer Prize in 1943 for his play The Skin of Our Teeth. Wilhelm, Richard Herman (1909- 1968), a teacher of chemical engineer\u00ad ing for thirty-four years and chairman of the department for fourteen, was re\u00ad garded by his colleagues as one of the leading engineer scientists in Princeton's history. His innovative drive made itself felt in teaching, in re\u00ad search, and in administration. Under his leadership the Department of Chemical Engineering rose to be one of the most eminent in the country. Born and raised in New York City, Wilhelm earned his three degrees (B. S. in Eng., Ch.E., and Ph.D.) at Colum\u00ad bia, and then spent his entire profes\u00ad sional career at Princeton. He came here as an instructor in 1934, became a full professor in 1946, and chairman of his department in 1954. An authority on chemical reaction engineering, he pioneered in fluidiza- tion and the development of fluid beds, which revolutionized the petroleum- cracking process. During his last years he discovered and refined the principle of parametric pumping, a process for separating the components of fluid mix\u00ad tures, which has possible uses for separating salt from ocean water and waste from streams and may explain certain processes in living cells. Although always an energetic and productive investigator, he gave first priority to teaching. \"The primary func\u00ad tion of the university is to teach,\" he once said, \"and its most important focus of education should be on the under\u00ad graduate.\" According to the Princeton Engineer, \"his chief pleasure was work\u00ad ing with students in the classroom and the laboratory.\" He was at the same time a magnet for graduate students\u2014 their number increased from ten to seventy during his chairmanship\u2014and his Ph. D. 's are to be found on chemical engineering faculties across the coun\u00ad try. His faculty colleagues described him as \"a gracious man, always sensi\u00ad tive to the concerns of those around him.\" In his presence, they said, his students and his associates \"felt wel\u00ad come, at ease, and reassured by his confidence in them.\" His research and teaching won him many professional honors, including three awards from the American Insti\u00ad tute of Chemical Engineers: the Wil\u00ad liam H. Walker Award and the Profes\u00ad sional Progress Award for his contribu\u00ad tions to research and publication, the Warren K. Lewis Award for his \"distin\u00ad guished and continuing contributions to chemical engineering education.\" He was elected a Fellow of the Ameri\u00ad can Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1964 and was given the American Chemical Society's award in industrial and engineering chemistry in 1966. Wilhelm's creative energies spread to all parts of the University. He di\u00ad rected a conference on \"Engineering and Human Affairs\" as part of the Uni\u00ad versity's Bicentennial Celebration in 1946. Three years later he organized a program of study combining elements of chemical engineering, biology, chemistry, and mathematics, to pre\u00ad pare students for careers in the biologi\u00ad cal industry and for postgraduate re\u00ad search in this area. Later he helped devise a program in engineering and public affairs, jointly administered by the engineering school and the Wood- row Wilson School. In 1966 he helped organize a University-wide committee 508 SAMUEL STANLEY WILKS to coordinate and strengthen Prince\u00ad ton's work in the life sciences. In June 1968, two months after his election to the National Academy of Engineering, he was appointed by the trustees to the Henry Putnam Univer\u00ad sity Professorship, a chair of special dis\u00ad tinction used \"for recognition of a scholar of extraordinary ability in any discipline.\" Six weeks later while on vacation he died of heart attack at the age of fifty-nine. Thus, his faculty col\u00ad leagues wrote, \"Princeton University and the science and art of engineering . . . lost far too soon the contributions of a creative teacher-scholar.\" The R. H. Wilhelm Award in Chem\u00ad ical Reaction Engineering was estab\u00ad lished by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers in 1973. The fol\u00ad lowing year, the University, with con\u00ad tributions from colleagues, friends, and students, instituted the Richard H. Wilhelm Lectureships in Chemical Engineering. Wilks, Samuel Stanley (1906-1964), the father of mathematical statistics at Princeton and a leader in the develop\u00ad ment of that discipline in the United States, was born on his father's farm near the town of Little Elm in northern Texas. He began his education in a one-room schoolhouse in Little Elm, and later attended high school in nearby Denton. He took his bachelor's degree at North Texas State Teachers College, his master's at the University of Texas, and his Ph.D. at the Univer\u00ad sity of Iowa, then the center for statisti\u00ad cal study in the United States. He came to Princeton in 1933, and in 1944 was appointed professor of mathematics and director of the newly founded Section of Mathematical Statistics, positions he held until his death twenty years later. The twenty-one men who took their Ph.D.'s under Wilks played a leading role in the development of statistics in the United States and Canada. As graduate students, they had been in\u00ad spired by his high expectations of them. Wilks was delighted when a student produced a fresh solution to a problem. \"Kind of a nice result,\" he would say in his Texas drawl, \"kind of pretty.\" Un\u00ad dergraduates responded equally well to his generous sharing of ideas and his challenging teaching; a number of senior theses written under him were published. Wilks was concerned with keeping theoretical and applied mathematics in close association and in having them contribute to other disciplines. As one of his students, Frederick Mosteller, first chairman of the Harvard depart\u00ad ment of mathematical statistics, said, \"Boundaries between disciplines, or\u00ad ganizations, and people never lasted long in his mind, for he thought in terms of bridges, entrances, and oppor\u00ad tunities.\" Wilks sought to improve the teaching of mathematics at all levels, from kindergarten through high school as well as in college and graduate school. He organized courses on quality control inspection sampling for industry and made wartime contributions to an\u00ad tisubmarine warfare and the solution of convoy problems. He was chairman of the committee that analyzed the rea\u00ad sons public opinion polls had errone\u00ad ously predicted the outcome of the 1948 Dewey-Truman presidential elec\u00ad tion. And it was at his suggestion that Princeton's football coach Charlie Caldwell used game movies, replayed many times, to grade each player on every play, in order to evaluate his ef\u00ad fectiveness under varying conditions more accurately. Although Wilks was responsible for a CLODIUS HARRIS WILLIS 509 considerable body of original research, his major contribution to his profession was as committeeman and adviser. \"He was a hard-working, modest committee member,\" his Princeton colleague John Tukey recalled,\"who was always there; who always knew, though he would only admit it indirectly, more about re\u00ad lated programs than anyone else.\" Be\u00ad cause of these qualities he was widely sought as a leader in scholarly organiza\u00ad tions and as an adviser to the federal government. Professor Mosteller called him the \"Statesman of Statistics\"\u2014a title borne out by even a partial listing of the offices Wilks held: president of the American Statistical Association as well as of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, of which he was a founder; chairman of the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences, which he helped to create, and also of the Divi\u00ad sion of Mathematics of the National Re\u00ad search Council; director of the Social Science Research Council; member of the United States Commission for UNESCO; member of the Applied Mathematics Panel of the Office of Sci\u00ad entific Research and Development dur\u00ad ing World War II; and later adviser and consultant to many agencies in the Executive Office of the President, in the Department of Defense, and in the National Science Foundation. He was editor of the Annals of Mathematical Statistics during eleven crucial years in which it became the foremost journal in its field. He was a member, and active committeeman, of the American Philo\u00ad sophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Wilks impressed his students and his colleagues as a vigorous, wise, and de\u00ad voted man, sensitive to the feelings of others, and possessing a technical skill adequate to any demand. But, in the words of Professor Tukey, he is re\u00admembered by them above all for \"his Scottish canny knack for finding a way through their intellectual or organiza\u00ad tional brambles.\" Williams, Jesse Lynch 1892 (1871- 1929), began his literary career early in his junior year when he won a short story contest conducted by the Nassau Literary Magazine. He was later an editor of the Lit and, with Booth Tar- kington, co-founder of the Triangle Club. While a graduate student (he earned his A.M. in 1895) he wrote Princeton Stories, in which the Ameri\u00ad can undergraduate, who had usually been presented as a football hero, was portrayed at work and at play in his everyday campus setting. Williams was one of the founders of the Alumni Weekly and from 1900 to 1903 its first editor. In the quarter-century from 1904 to 1929 Williams wrote six novels and four plays. His comedy, Why Marry? (1917) won the first Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The University made him an honorary Doctor of Letters in 1919. Willis, Clodius Harris (1893-1964), first Arthur Le Grand Doty Professor of Electrical Engineering, was a Virginian who did his undergraduate work at the University of Richmond and took his Ph.D. in physics and electrical en\u00ad gineering at Johns Hopkins. He came to Princeton in 1926 during the forma\u00ad tive years of the School of Engineering and, as a teacher for thirty-two years and departmental chairman for four\u00ad teen, was influential in developing the School's basic concepts of engineering education. During most of his career, he was consultant to the research laboratories of the General Electric Company, and, for several years, to the Brookhaven 510 EDMUND WILSON National Laboratory of the Atomic En\u00ad ergy Commission. He held thirty-five patents relating to electronic power converters, and was one of the first to recognize, in the 1930s, the advantages of using direct current for the long- range transmission of electric power. Professor Willis's introductory course in the principles of electrical en\u00ad gineering, required of all engineering students regardless of department, was frequently voted the most popular course in the School of Engineering. His tests were noted for their tough\u00ad ness but, as one student said, his \"cheerful countenance and rosy smile never failed to win back your confi\u00ad dence after an hour's struggle with heavy formulas.\" During World War II he supervised four teaching programs that operated concurrently but on different schedules: Army, Navy, and civilian programs at the undergraduate level, and a postgraduate program that graduated 790 Navy radar officers. He also intensified his advisory work and his consultation with the government. After the war he began to suffer from Parkinson's disease, which compelled him to curtail his activities. He gave up the chairmanship of the department in 1950 and retired from teaching at the age of 65 in 1958. At his death in 1964, his colleagues paid him this tribute: Clodius Willis believed that en\u00ad gineering as an applied science should be based upon central princi\u00ad ples and concepts rather than upon mere collection of facts, and that it must, therefore, have at its base a sound knowledge of mathematics and the pure sciences, tempered with a true insight into . . . the humanities and the social sciences. When the scientific and technological explo\u00ad sions of recent years revealed deficiencies in engineering education in the country at large, Princeton re\u00ad quired no revolution in its way of doing things. Instead it had only to press more rapidly the evolution of its original principles established years ago by a small group of wise men. Clodius Willis was a leading member of this distinguished group. WUson, Edmund 16 (1895-1972), be\u00ad ginning as a brilliant eager, tireless,\" wrote Dean Christian Gauss, \"he bubbled with ideas and threw them out by the handful\"), came eventually to be rec\u00ad ognized as the dean of American critics. Through nearly half a century, when not engaged with poetry, plays, and novels of his own, he devoted his ener\u00ad gies to the reading and judging of work by others. In so doing, he developed a remarkable art of criticism-in-narrative. His honorary degree citation for the Doctor of Letters degree in 1956 called it \"a versatile instrument which he . . . employed both for the reassessment of the literary classics and for the encour\u00ad agement and appreciation of rising new writers.\" His devotion to good writing was one of the great constants of his life. It first became apparent at the Hill School, where he prepared for college, con\u00ad tinued at Princeton, where he be\u00ad longed to Charter Club and helped T. K. Whipple 12 in the great revival of the Nassau Lit, and shifted afterward to New York, where he served briefly as reporter for the Evening Sun. Although some of his classmates had found him cool and aloof-\u2014he looked upon the \"circus aspects of undergraduate life,\" as Dean Gauss said, \"with amused toleration\"\u2014the best writers on cam-EDMUND WILSON 511 pus had coalesced around him like bees round a hive and soon recognized that he was ready and eager to print any\u00ad thing they wrote unless it was preten\u00ad tious or shoddy. In 1917-1919 he was too busy with the Army Intelligence Corps to write much except reports. After the war he made up for the lapse by serving for a year as managing editor of Vogue, and subsequently as associate editor of The New Republic. Later he was literary critic for The New Yorker. Apart from these positions, the record of his life from the late 1920s to the early 1970s is very largely the record of the books he conceived, wrote, and saw through to publication. The bright and lively Axel's Castle of 1931 established his critical reputation, which was cemented by The Triple Thinkers and The Wound and the Bow. Before and after these books came travelogues such as Europe Without Baedeker-, the novels, I Thought of Daisy and Memoirs of Hecate County; a volume of verse; and several volumes of plays. Despite some dull stretches, To the Finfond Station remains an absorbing and informative history of socialism and communism, with sketches of the lives of the major revolutionaries from Marx and Engels to Lenin and Trotsky. Another thick volume, Patriotic Gore, first broached in the Gauss Seminars of 1952, offered a reprise of the most im\u00ad portant American literature related to the Civil War. He regularly collected his fugitive essays and reviews in what he liked to call \"literary chronicles,\" such as Cfossics and Commercials and The Shores of Light. The latter begins with an eloquent testimonial to the in\u00ad tellectual and pedagogical powers of Dean Gauss. Glorying in his reputation as a polymath and a multilingual, Wil\u00ad son added Hebrew to his arsenal of lan\u00adguages to facilitate his study of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and showed the range of his sociological interests in Red, Bhck, Blond, and Olive, synoptic studies in Zuni, Haitian, Russian, and Israeli civilizations. Two of his autobio\u00ad graphical books, A Prelude, which deals in part with his undergraduate years, and the crusty \"reflections at sixty\" that he called A Piece of My Mind, bracket the time from his young manhood to the beginnings of his old age. Ten years after his honorary degree at Princeton, he received the National Medal for Literature. He came with some frequency to Princeton in re\u00ad sponse to invitations to lecture or to conduct seminars, and several genera\u00ad tions of faculty and students came to know him by sight as well as reputa\u00ad tion. In his salad days, when his coevals all called him \"Bunny,\" he prided him\u00ad self on his lithe build and his skill in performing distinctive somersaults, but in his later years he developed a solid and beefy figure which gave him some\u00ad thing of the look of an ancient Roman senator and seemed to require that he be called Mr. Wilson. In the last twenty years of his life, he took particular pleasure in the rehabili\u00ad tation of an old stone house in upstate New York, willed him by his mother, and acquired the nickname of \"Squire.\" Talcottville was a pleasant hamlet and for Wilson a perennial refuge in which he accomplished a good deal of reading and writing, well away from the social whirl of Wellfleet on Cape Cod, where he lived for a number of years. The last publication of his lifetime was Upstate, a chronicle of his periodic residences there, with much about the history and character of the Wilson family, as well as sketches of his neighbors and part- time employees. His friend John Dos Passos, who was well acquainted with 512 WOODROW WILSON his penchant for conversations like those recorded in the book, joshed him with a limerick: He says he's the Talcottville squire But the facts will prove him a liar He don't plow, he don't harrow He don't push no wheelbarrow Hejuss sits and holds forth by the fire. Holding forth, whether viva voce or on the printed page, was one of Wilson's strong points, as farming was not. It was one of the qualities, along with his critical integrity, that he shared with another \"great cham of literature\" of at least equal stature: Dr. Samuel Johnson. Carlos Baker Wilson, [Thomas] Woodrow (1856- 1924), thirteenth president of Princeton, was born December 29, 1856, in Staunton, Virginia, the son of Joseph Ruggles Wilson, D. D., a Pres\u00ad byterian minister. Tommy Wilson, as he was called until after his graduation from college, grew up in Augusta, Georgia, and Columbia, South Carolina. After a freshman year at Davidson College, 1873-74, he with\u00ad drew to prepare himself for Princeton, where he matriculated in 1875 as a member of the Class of 1879. The next four years were a time of rapid maturing for the precocious youth. He supplemented a meager course fare with an ambitious program of reading; kept a commonplace book of passages from his reading; and organ\u00ad ized a student club for discussion of public afiFairs. His peers recognized his leadership abilities, electing him speaker of the American Whig Society, secretary of the Football Association, president of the Baseball Association (he remained an avid supporter of col\u00adlege sports the rest of his life), and managing editor of the Princetonian. He made a number of loyal friends who later played crucial roles in advancing his career. From 1879 to 1883, Wilson studied law at the University of Virginia and practiced in Atlanta. Disillusioned by the tedium and materialism of damage suits, he entered the Johns Hopkins University in 1883 for graduate work in political science and history. His doc\u00ad toral dissertation, Congressional Gov\u00ad ernment (1885), brought immediate fame appointments Mawr College (1885-88) and Wes- leyan University (1888-90). Meanwhile he had married Ellen Louise Axson of Rome, Georgia, in 1885. They had three daughters: Margaret Wilson; Jes\u00ad sie Woodrow Wilson, who married Francis B. Sayre; and Eleanor Ran\u00ad dolph Wilson, who married William Gibbs McAdoo. Ellen Axson Wilson died in 1914; Wilson married Edith Boiling Gait in 1915. Wilson's fondest dream came true with his election to a professorship at Princeton in 1890. When his eflorts to prod President Francis L. Patton (q.v.) to raise the money for a law school failed, Wilson set about preparing what was undoubtedly the best pre-law cur\u00ad riculum in the country. Year in and year out he was voted the most popular teacher on the faculty; he was also a friend and counselor to numberless students who worshipped him for his warmth and highmindedness. At the same time, his fame as a scholar grew. A regular lecturer at the Johns Hopkins and the New York Law School, he also spoke widely, contributed to popular magazines and wrote best-selling biography and history. However, his greatest triumph during this period was his eloquent and influential oration, WOODROW WILSON 513 \"Princeton in the Nation's Service\" (q.v.) at the Sesquicentennial in 1896. When Patton was to retire in June 1902, the trus\u00ad tees with one accord elected Wilson to fill the chair of Witherspoon and McCosh. In his first report to the Board of Trustees, the new president pre\u00ad sented a program, to cost $12.5 million, to transform Princeton into a major university. Substantial sums were not forthcoming, so Wilson moved slowly. He tightened academic standards so severely that enrollment declined sharply until 1907. Princeton had no administrative structure to speak of in 1902. One of Wilson's first actions was the creation of departments of instruc\u00ad tion with heads directly responsible to the president. He later arranged the creation of new deanships of the de\u00ad partments of science and of the college. At the same time, he took the effectual power of faculty nominations out of the control of the Trustees' Curriculum Committee and lodged it in the presi\u00ad dent and departments. These innovations were a prelude to more far-reaching changes. In 1904, Wilson led the faculty in instituting the most significant curricular reform in American higher education in the twentieth century. In place of the aim\u00ad less, free elective system, which had heretofore prevailed at Princeton as at other institutions, Wilson substituted a unified curriculum of general studies during the first two years, capped by concentrated study in one discipline (the first program for a major) and re\u00ad lated fields during the junior and senior years. There was the added provision of an honors program for ambitious stu\u00ad dents. The following year, 1905, Wilson revolutionized the teaching system. Supported by the first organized yearly alumni fund-raising campaign in Princeton's history, Wilson overnight doubled the faculty by the appointment of almost fifty assistant professors called preceptors. (See Preceptorial Method.) They were to be the companions and guides of undergraduates. Instead of memorizing lecture notes and text\u00ad books, students would master fields of knowledge through guided reading and small-group discussion. With a re\u00ad markable eye for quality, Wilson as\u00ad sembled what was probably the finest young faculty anywhere. Out of this group came many of the professors and administrators who later made Princeton renowned among the univer\u00ad sities of the world. Wilson supported Dean Henry B. Fine 1880, in strengthening the science program, insisting all the while that re\u00ad search in science should be pure re\u00ad search. He took biblical instruction out of the hands of a fundamentalist and appointed a scholar in his place. He broke the hold of conservative Presby\u00ad terians over the Board of Trustees, and symbolic of this change was a 1906 Board resolution that formally declared Princeton a non-sectarian institution. He appointed the first Jew and Roman Catholic to the faculty. He was instru\u00ad mental in the addition to the physical plant of three buildings for instruction (McCosh Hall, Palmer Laboratory, Guyot Hall), four dormitories (Seventy-Nine, Patton, Campbell, and Holder Halls), the gymnasium and Lake Carnegie, the faculty room in Nassau Hall, the FitzRandolph gate\u00ad way, and the Mather sundial. The University also acquired the Springdale golf links, 221 acres of valuable real es\u00ad tate. Administration, curriculum, and teaching methods had been brought 514 WOODROW WILSON into organic unity by 1906. However, in Wilson's view the social life of the undergraduates remained not only be\u00ad yond university control but also detri\u00ad mental to the intellectual life and social democracy of the University. The social life of about two thirds of the upper- classmen centered in the eating clubs on Prospect Avenue. Wilson said that they were the sideshows that were swallowing up the main tent. Worse still, the clubs encouraged snobbish\u00ad ness and elitism, and the one third of excluded upperclassmen lived in isola\u00ad tion and, frequently, ostracism and humiliation. In the early months of 1906, Wilson resolved to move against the clubs, but he well knew that it might take years to effect any significant change. A severe stroke in May 1906 threatened his life, and he decided to act while time was left to him. He presented a plan to the trustees, tentatively in December 1906 and in mature form six months later. It proposed the creation of quadrangles, or colleges, in which undergradutes of all four classes would live, with their own recreational facilities and resident faculty masters. Membership would be by assignment or lot, and the clubs would either be absorbed into the quads or abolished. The trustees approved the quad plan in principle and Wilson announced it at commencement in June 1907. Alumni, particularly in New York and Philadel\u00ad phia, were soon up in arms against a plan that they said would deprive un\u00ad dergraduates of freedom of social choice and destroy class spirit. Wilson responded patiently, but to no avail. Opposition grew, annual giving de\u00ad clined. Bowing in October 1907, the trustees withdrew their approval of the quad plan. One wealthy trustee and donor, M. Taylor Pyne 1877, threatened to withdraw his support if Wilson resumed his campaign for the plan. Wilson did not give up the fight. It sensitized him to glaring social injustice for the first time and transformed him into a radical social democrat by 1909. By then, however, he was embroiled in another controversy, over a residential graduate college. Andrew F. West 1874 (q.v.), dean of the Graduate School since its creation in 1900, had one great obsession\u2014 erection of a handsome graduate col\u00ad lege where he could preside in Gothic splendor. At first he said that he wanted the college located in the cen\u00ad ter of the campus. Wilson heartily con\u00ad curred, for he believed that the graduate establishment should be the energizing force in the intellectual life of the University. Wilson also worked hard, and successfully, to add distin\u00ad guished professors in order to strengthen the graduate teaching pro\u00ad gram. Relations between Wilson and West deteriorated after 1906 as West made it clear that he wanted a luxurious graduate college with gentlemen scholars, far removed from the bustle of the campus. Josephine Ward Thomson Swann, a Princeton resident, died in 1906, leaving $275,000 for a graduate college. Supporting Wilson, the trus\u00ad tees in 1908 voted that it should be built upon the grounds of Prospect. But while the plans were being drawn, in May 1909, William Cooper Procter 1883, of Cincinnati, announced that he would give $500,000 for the graduate college and program, provided that the trustees raised an equal amount and agreed to an off-campus location for the college. In October, Procter selected the Springdale golf course as his site. Wilson fought desperately against WOODROW WILSON COLLEGE 515 the Procter offer, charging that money was trying to dictate educational policies. He finally came out into the open, saying that the fundamental issue was Dean West and his exclusive social ideals. The New York and Philadelphia alumni joined the fray, with Pyne tak\u00ad ing leadership of the anti-Wilson ele\u00ad ment. Procter withdrew his offer in February 1910 before a special trustees' committee could recommend against it. However, Isaac C. Wyman 1848, of Salem, Massachusetts, died on May 18, 1910, leaving his entire estate, esti\u00ad mated to be worth at least $3 million, for the graduate college and program and naming West as one of his two executors. Wilson surrendered at once. \"We've beaten the living,\" he said to his wife, \"but we can't fight the dead.\" Ironically, the Wyman estate turned out to be worth only $794,000. With West and Pyne in control and the latter maneuvering for Wilson's removal, Wilson now began to turn a receptive ear to George Harvey, New York editor and politician, and James Smith, Jr., of Newark, leader of the New Jersey Democratic party. They had been urging the Princetonian to ac\u00ad cept the Democratic nomination for governor of New Jersey, as a stepping stone to the White House. West's triumph did not leave Wilson much choice. He accepted the nomination in September and went on to win the gov\u00ad ernorship in 1910 and the presidency of the United States in 1912. The story of his political career belongs elsewhere. Although he maintained his voting res\u00ad idence in Princeton, he rarely returned to the scene of his great academic achievements and defeats. He died at his home in Washington on February 3, 1924, and was interred in the Washing\u00ad ton Cathedral. Wilson had a larger hand in the de\u00advelopment of Princeton into a great university than any other man in the twentieth century. He left a vision of an institution dedicated both to things of the mind and the nation's service, pro\u00ad moted a spirit of religious tolerance, and held up ideals of integrity and achievement that still inspire the Princeton community. Arthur S. Link Wilson, Woodrow, Award founded in 1956, the centennial year of Wilson's birth, is presented annually to an alumnus in recognition of distinguished achievement \"in the Nation's Service.\" Recipients, selected from a broad spec\u00ad trum of service to the nation and to the world, have included: Allen O. Whip\u00ad ple '04, surgeon and of Smyth U.S. Representative on the Interna\u00ad tional Atomic Energy Agency; Adlai E. Stevenson '22, Ambassador to the U.N.; Eugene C. Blake '28, secretary- general, World Council of Churches; John D. Rockefeller 3rd '29, philan\u00ad thropist; Claiborne Pell '40, U.S. senator from Rhode Island; John M. Doar '44, chief counsel for the House Judiciary Committee at the 1974 im\u00ad peachment hearings; Ralph Nader '55, consumer advocate. Wilson, Woodrow, College is a resi\u00ad dential community of nearly 400 un\u00ad dergraduates. Its nucleus is Wilcox Hall, which contains dining, social, and educational facilities, including the Ju\u00ad lian Street Library of more than 10,000 volumes. Around Wilcox are six dor\u00ad mitories for members of the College\u2014 1915, 1922, 1937, 1938, and 1939 dor\u00ad mitories, and Dodge-Osborn Hall. The College was named in honor of Wood- row Wilson (q.v.), who had sought un-516 WOODROW WILSON COLLEGE successfully to establish a plan of resi\u00ad dential colleges at Princeton. The College evolved from Woodrow Wilson Lodge, which was founded in 1957 by a dozen members of the Class of 1959 \"to provide a place where indi\u00ad viduals . . . could be accepted for what they are and not forced to conform to the narrow specifications of Bicker [eat\u00ad ing club elections]. ...\" Membership burgeoned several years later when Darwin R. Labarth '61, a class officer, led a large group of his classmates into its ranks. Madison Hall, one of the University's dining halls, served as the common dining and social facility until 1961, when the organization moved to the newly completed Wilcox Hall. It thereupon changed its name to the Woodrow Wilson Society to reflect the wider objectives and diversity made possible by its new facilities and by the inclusion of sophomores in its member\u00ad ship. In these early years, social activities \u2014hayrides in horse-drawn wagons, rock bands, dances, and the like\u2014were made possible by fees paid voluntarily by members who wished to participate. The University provided money for educational purposes, spent with the advice and consent of the Master- in-Residence. As part of its effort to integrate the social and intellectual sides of undergraduate life, the Society sponsored foreign-language tables, evening lectures, art exhibits, music recitals, film series, and poetry and in\u00ad formal play readings. These activities were strengthened by the faculty fellow program, which brought faculty mem\u00ad bers into the life of the Society and en\u00ad hanced informal contacts between fac\u00ad ulty and students. In 1967, Julian Jaynes, then master- in-residence, proposed to the Univer\u00ad sity that the Society become a truly res\u00adidential entity. Accordingly, Woodrow Wilson College was created the follow\u00ad ing spring, with membership open to all four classes. Whereas previously members had lived in scattered dor\u00ad mitories, they were now required not only to eat at Wilcox but also to reside in the six dormitories in the surround\u00ad ing quadrangle. In addition to the mas\u00ad ter, an associate master and two assist\u00ad ant masters-in-residence were named. Apartments in the dormitories were set aside for eight resident faculty fellows; the number of associate fellows swelled to nearly a hundred. Resident advisers were appointed among the junior, senior, and graduate student members to advise incoming freshmen, and a faculty member was named academic adviser. The College itself continued to be directed by student officers and committees chosen by the member\u00ad ship. Wilcox Hall was remodeled to pro\u00ad vide study carrels, seminar rooms, an art studio, a coffee shop, a darkroom, and a small theater in the basement. A successful drama program, which pro\u00ad duced several plays each year, a weekly film series, and a literary magazine, the Catalyst, were among the tangible re\u00ad sults of this reorganization. From 1966 to 1968, student-initiated seminars were offered in an experimen\u00ad tal college, founded under the leader\u00ad ship of Daniel Altman '67. In the early 1970s, the Woodrow Wilson \"Knight\" School provided training in such areas as auto mechanics, bartending, draw\u00ad ing, music theory, baking, foreign lan\u00ad guages, bicycle repair and mainte\u00ad nance, and bridge. Masters-in-residence have greatly contributed to Wilson's success since its inception: James Ward Smith, Pro\u00ad fessor of Philosophy, 1963-1965; Julian Jaynes, Lecturer in Psychology, 1966-THE PAPERS OF WOODROW WILSON 517 1969; John V. Fleming, Professor of English, 1969-1972; Henry N. Drewry, Lecturer in History, 1972-1975; and Norman Itzkowitz, Professor of Near Eastern Studies, 1975- Mark I. Davies Wilson, Woodrow, Fellowship Pro\u00ad gram, The, a nationwide search for college teaching talent, grew out of a pioneering effort begun at Princeton at the end of the Second World War. The idea, as conceived by Professor Whit\u00ad ney J. Oates, was to help renew the normal flow of graduate students, which had dried up during the war, by inviting ex-servicemen who were thought to have gifts for teaching to try out a year of graduate study. One of the first invited was Robert F. Goheen '40, who later became president of the Uni\u00ad versity. Fellowship funds to comple\u00ad ment G.I. benefits were provided ini\u00ad tially by Miss Isabelle Kemp of New York City, Randolph Compton '15, Donald Mixsell 15, and William D. Sherrerd, Jr. '25. These were supple\u00ad mented by appropriations from the University's general funds and in 1947 by a grant from the Carnegie Corpora\u00ad tion of America. Professor Oates and Professor George A. Graham were co\u00ad administrators of the program. The University's program was found to have a continuing value that went beyond the immediate needs of the postwar period, and in 1951 it was taken over by the Association of Graduate Schools (a component of the Association of American Universities) and considerably expanded. Among those who served as national director under the guidance of Dean Hugh S. Taylor, then chairman of the Fellow\u00ad ship Committee of the Association of Graduate Schools, were Princeton Pro\u00adfessors Courtney C. Smith and Robert Goheen. The fellowships awarded under the enlarged program were un\u00ad derwritten by the thirty-seven univer\u00ad sities which comprised the Association of American Universities and by grants from the Carnegie Corporation and the General Education Board. Not all Woodrow Wilson Fellows be\u00ad came teachers. Ralph Nader '55, for example, went on to become a crusader for consumer interests and other as\u00ad pects of public welfare. In 1958 a separate organization, the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, was established with Dean Taylor as President and his eventual successor Hans Rosenhaupt, formerly of Columbia University, as national di\u00ad rector. For ten years thereafter Ford Foundation grants totaling $52 million permitted the Wilson Fellowship Foundation to disburse $5 million an\u00ad nually: $3 million in stipends for Fel\u00ad lows, $2 million in grants for graduate schools chosen by the Fellows. Before 1958 about 200 fellowships were awarded annually. In the last year of substantial Ford Foundation support almost a thousand were awarded. Massive Ford Foundation support ceased in 1967. Between 1968 and 1971, the Wilson Fellowship Founda\u00ad tion continued to identify good candi\u00ad dates for graduate schools even though it was able to provide financial support for only about 150 of them each year. Thereafter, although fellowships for first-year graduate students were no longer offered, the Foundation con\u00ad tinued to conduct a variety of programs concerned with the recruitment and placement of graduate students. Wilson, Woodrow, The Papers of, sponsored jointly by the Woodrow Wil\u00ad son Foundation and Princeton Univer-518 WILSON SCHOOL OF PUBLIC AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS sity, will, when the approximately forty-five volumes have been com\u00ad pleted, constitute the first full-scale edition of the papers of any modern American President. The series has won critical acclaim as one of this cen\u00ad tury's \"distinguished historical enter\u00ad prises\" whose \"scholarship, format, and scrupulous editing meet the highest standards of the craft.\" The Papers were the outgrowth of the Wilson Centennial Year of 1956 when a national effort to recall Wilson's many-faceted contributions brought to light the need of a full-scale edition of his papers. The Woodrow Wilson Foundation of New York, which had been founded in 1922 for the perpetua\u00ad tion of Wilson's ideals, led the way in meeting this need. The Foundation se\u00ad cured contributions with which to start the project and then suspended all its other activities in order to devote its own capital resources as needed to the completion of The Papers. Princeton University became cosponsor in 1959, assuming responsibility for housing the papers and for helping to care for its staff. Arthur S. Link, author of the defini\u00ad tive biography of Woodrow Wilson, was appointed Editor of the Papers in 1958 and was called to Princeton as Professor of History in 1959. Associate editors from the early stages of the project have been John Wells Davidson, who served from 1958 until his retirement in 1972, and David W. Hirst, who has occupied that position continuously since the publication of the first volume. John E. Little has been associate editor since 1971. The first volume appeared in the fall of 1966, and by the spring of 1978, twenty-six volumes had been pub\u00ad lished. The Papers include most of the let\u00adters Wilson wrote and a substantial proportion of those he received, most of his speeches, samples of his class\u00ad room and lecture notes, all of his im\u00ad portant articles, two of his books, cen\u00ad tral in the development of his political thought (Congressional Government and Constitutional Government in the United States), and his important polit\u00ad ical and diplomatic correspondence and other state papers. Volume 1 and Volumes 7 through 20, which cover Wilson's years as Princeton student, professor and president, constitute virtually a documentary history of the University, unique in the annals of American higher education. The Papers also include transcripts of many of the shorthand notes Wilson made throughout his life, using the Graham method, now almost extinct. The editors had the good fortune to find several older Graham experts to make the transcripts and thus secure for posterity much important material that Wilson wrote in shorthand, including a remarkable diary he kept while an un\u00ad dergraduate at Princeton, which opens with the maxim: \"To save time is to lengthen life.\" Wilson, Woodrow, School of Public and International Affairs is a memorial to the University's thirteenth president and the nation's twenty-eighth. De\u00ad signed to prepare students for careers in public service in keeping with the tradition described in Woodrow Wil\u00ad son's oration \"Princeton in the Nation's Service\" (q.v.), the school was founded in 1930 as a cooperative enterprise of the History, Politics, and Economics Departments at the undergraduate level. In 1948 the trustees named the school for Wilson and established a graduate program, which was consider\u00ad ably expanded after 1961, when the WILSON SCHOOL OF PUBLIC AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS 519 University received a generous gift for this purpose. The prime movers in the founding of the school were Charter Trustees Wil\u00ad liam Church Osborn 1883 and Albert G. Milbank 1896, who obtained financ\u00ad ing for its early years and who were key members of its original advisory board. Their contributions to the school's origin and development were later rec\u00ad ognized by the creation of a memorial professorship in public affairs for Os\u00ad born and one in international law for Milbank. Initially the school was administered by a faculty committee, of which poli\u00ad tics professor Harold W. Dodds, later University president, was chairman. A leading authority on municipal gov\u00ad ernment, Dodds guided the school's first faculty research project, a survey of state expenditures in New Jersey, undertaken at the request of the gover\u00ad nor. The school's first director was Dewitt Clinton Poole, previously counselor of the United States Embassy in Berlin. Called to Princeton to help establish the school, he served as director from 1933 until 1939. Poole was chiefly re\u00ad sponsible for the early development of a conference course in which under\u00ad graduates were trained to apply the analytical methods of their academic studies to the world's practical problems\u2014a contribution which, Pres\u00ad ident Dodds said, made the School at that time \"the most significant experi\u00ad ment in the teaching of the social studies . . . in any American univer\u00ad sity.\" The school's early years saw the be\u00ad ginnings of two research programs. The State and Local Government Section, which was created in 1935, continued active under John F. Sly's direction until 1961. In 1936, the Office of Popu\u00adlation Research (q.v.) was founded through the influence of Frederick Os\u00ad born '10 (son of William Church Os\u00ad born), who was a trustee of the Milbank Memorial Fund, which provided much of the original financing; under the di\u00ad rection of Frank Notestein, later of Ansley J. Coale, and more recently of Charles F. Westoff, it has been interna\u00ad tionally famous. Succeeding Poole as director was Dana Gardner Munro, who had come to Princeton as a professor of history in 1932 after serving as chief of the State Department's Division of Latin Ameri\u00ad can Affairs and as minister to Haiti. His nineteen-year tenure, from 1939 to 1958, brought significant advances in the school's development. In 1939, the School became a separate department for purposes of undergraduate concen\u00ad tration, allowing upperclassmen to do their independent work and take their final examination in the fields of public or international affairs rather than in one of the social science departments, as formerly. Under Munro, the confer\u00ad ence course continued to be the most distinctive feature of the program, which was further enriched by senior seminars (and in later years by policy task forces, smaller versions of the con\u00ad ference). Up to 1948 the director of the school was also director of the undergraduate program. Since then, those in charge of the undergradute program have in\u00ad cluded William W. Lockwood, Harold Chase, William D. Carmichael, Jame\u00ad son W. Doig, and Robert van de Velde. THE GRADUATE PROGRAM The Munro years also saw the begin\u00ad ning of a graduate program, the strengthening of the faculty, and the creation of the school's first real home. These developments followed the trus-520 WILSON SCHOOL OF PUBLIC AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS tees' naming of the school for Woodrow Wilson, thus providing what President Dodds called \"a natural and fitting memorial.\" Wilson, he said, \"expressed in one sentence . . . the central truth to which instruction in this School is dedi\u00ad cated: 'We are not put into this world to sit still and know; we are put here to act.' \" Donald H. Wallace, who had been a key economic adviser in the Office of Price Administration during World War II, was called to Princeton in 1947 as first director of the graduate program and was later appointed first incumbent of the William Church Osborn profes\u00ad sorship. Wallace's pioneering effort to develop a new approach to professional training in public affairs was cut short by his death in 1953. He was succeeded by Stephen K. Bailey and subsequently by Harold Stein, and followed as Os\u00ad born Professor by Bailey in 1954 and by Ansley J. Coale, head of the Office of Population Research, in 1964. The school's work in the interna\u00ad tional field was strengthened in 1951 when Frederick S. Dunn (Princeton 4) and six of his associates at the Yale Institute of International Studies, of which he had been director, were called to Princeton. Dunn was ap\u00ad pointed first Milbank Professor and first director of the School's Center of International Studies (q.v.), founded with the help of the Milbank Memorial Fund. He was later succeeded in this post by economist Klaus Knorr, and subsequently by historian Cyril E. Black. In the late 1940s, a committee headed by Charter Trustee Dean Mathey '12, began raising funds to endow the school's development as a memorial to Wilson and to provide a building to suit its special needs. Woodrow Wilson Hall, at the corner of Prospect Avenue and Washington Road, was dedicated in 1952, replacing the temporary quarters the School had previously occupied in Dickinson and Whig Halls and in the former Arbor Inn eating club. That same year, John D. Rockefeller III '29, then a charter trustee, insti\u00ad tuted a program of annual awards for outstanding public service, to be ad\u00ad ministered by the School. Originally restricted to federal career officials, the program was broadened in 1976 to honor individuals from both within and outside government for outstanding contributions to the public welfare at all levels\u2014local, state, and national. THE ROBERTSON GIFT A new era began in 1961 with a $35 million gift designed to develop within the School, in President Goheen's words, \"professional education for the public service at a level of excellence comparable to the country's outstand\u00ad ing schools of law and medicine.\" The donors, Charles S. Robertson '26 and his wife Marie, insisted on anonymity, and for a dozen years the origin of the gift\u2014the largest in Princeton's history\u2014was a well kept secret. But the University was embarassed by continu\u00ad ing speculation about the source of the funds, and in 1973, Robertson reluc\u00ad tantly agreed to let the facts be known. The Robertson benefaction permit\u00ad ted a marked increase in enrollment of graduate students, enlargement of the faculty, and the creation of new facili\u00ad ties. A new building, designed by Min- oru Yamasaki, was erected on the site of the old one, which was moved to its present location and renamed Corwin Hall (q.v.). The new building was dedi\u00ad cated in May 1966 with addresses by President Goheen, Governor Richard J. Hughes, and President Lyndon B. Johnson. At the dedication, President Goheen WILSON SCHOOL OF PUBLIC AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS 521 described the contributions trustees and faculty members had made to the school's early development and then paid particular tribute to three men, who had \"directed the School so ably in this great new phase of its develop\u00ad ment\": Gardner Patterson, director from 1958 to 1963, Lester V. Chandler, acting director for the year 1963-64, and Marver H. Bernstein, the school's first dean from 1964 to 1969. Patterson became deputy director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Bernstein, president of Bran- deis University. Bernstein had been the first director of the graduate program after the Robertson gift. He was succeeded in that post by William G. Bowen, later president of the University, and Richard A. Lester, later dean of the faculty. Subsequent directors have been Richard H. Ullman, Michael N. Danielson, Jameson W. Doig, David F. Bradford, and Charles H. Berry. Since 1961 the faculty of the school has been augmented by appointments from outside Princeton as well as from the University's social science depart\u00ad ments. Those called to Princeton in\u00ad cluded Sir W. Arthur Lewis, authority on the economy of developing nations, who was appointed first incumbent of the School's newly created James Madison Professorship of Political Economy; and Richard FaIk, an au\u00ad thority on the international legal order and comparative world order systems, who was named second incumbent of the Milbank Professorship of Interna\u00ad tional Law and Practice. Two of the new faculty members came to Princeton as deans. John P. Lewis, who had previously served as a member of the President's Council on Economic Advisers and as minister- director of the AID mission to India, was dean of the school from 1969 to 1974. He was succeeded by Donald E. Stokes, an authority on American and British voting habits, who had won high honors in the school on his graduation from Princeton in 1951 and, after taking his Ph.D. in politics at Yale, had gone on to become dean of the graduate school at the University of Michigan. As the faculty expanded, new special\u00ad ized research resources were added, including a program, founded in 1967, under the direction of W. Arthur Lewis and later of John P. Lewis, on the economic development of less de\u00ad veloped nations. A research program on criminal justice, under the direction of Jameson W. Doig, was begun in 1973 with funds from the Daniel and Flor\u00ad ence Guggenheim Foundation. To facilitate student and faculty involve\u00ad ment in public affairs within the state, a new Center for New Jersey Affairs, under the direction of Michael N. Danielson, was established with a fed\u00ad eral grant in 1975. The school in 1966 initiated a small Ph.D. program for selected graduates of its master's program, with substantial experience in public affairs, who plan to pursue public service careers in which a Ph.D. is desirable. The school's work in mid-career edu\u00ad cation, begun on a small scale in 1948 to help prepare men and women for posi\u00ad tions of greater responsibility in their professions, was considerably expanded in the early 1960s by the development of two new, one-year, non-degree pro\u00ad grams. One program, begun in 1962, has brought to the school annually a select group of some twenty officials of federal, state, and local governments. Another, started in 1961 with support from the Albert Parvin Foundation, has brought each year six to eight talented men and women from developing coun\u00ad tries as distant and diverse as Chile, India, Korea, Malaysia, Nigeria, the 522 WILSON SCHOOL OF PUBLIC AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Philippines, and Sudan. In 1975, a third program was established with support from the Alfred P. Sloan Foun\u00ad dation; it has brought to the school an\u00ad nually eight journalists for training in the application of modern economic analysis to questions of public policy. In the mid seventies, the school's faculty numbered about forty regular members, each of whom, with rare ex\u00ad ceptions, held an appointment in another department as well. Thirty other members of social science de\u00ad partments also participated in the graduate program. The school's student body included about 120 under\u00ad graduates equally divided among juniors and seniors, approximately 110 graduate students working toward the Master of Public Affairs or the Doctor of Philosophy degree, and about 40 mid-career fellows. The essential qualities that distin\u00ad guish the Wilson School from com\u00ad parable programs at other universities were outlined by Dean Stokes in a 1976 Alumni Weekly interview. Princeton's program, he noted, is one of the few that admits both undergraduates and graduate students\u2014an arrangement that works to the advantage of both groups, undergraduates profiting by exposure to more mature graduate stu\u00ad dents and experienced mid-careerists, and the latter finding stimulation in their exposure \"to the freshness of the undergraduates, their drive, their men\u00ad tal sharpness.\" Another difference he mentioned was that, while most other schools are devoted mainly to the study of either domestic or of foreign affairs, the Wil\u00ad son School is equally committed to both, and the career interests of stu\u00ad dents reflect a similar balance. \"Those whose interests are international,\" Dean Stokes said, \"need to know more about the way things work in Washing\u00ad ton and, indeed, in Trenton, NJ. . . . And many jobs in the domestic field re\u00ad quire knowledge of how foreign coun\u00ad tries handle similar problems. Much can be learned, for example, about the problems of our own cities by studying urban problems overseas, and this thrust toward comparative study is far more likely to be real in a school with a strong international dimension.\" However, the characteristic that he personally found most appealing was the \"remarkably modern interdiscipli\u00ad nary nature of the School, built in at the very beginning.\" He liked, for exam\u00ad ple, the way economics and political science, each a major discipline, inter\u00ad act with one another and with more technical fields. \"So many combina\u00ad tions are possible,\" he said. \"There is so much openness. Where a student has an interest in a technological field, we try to work out a joint-degree program. We have close ties as well both to the School of Architecture and Urban Planning and to the School of Engineer\u00ad ing and Applied Science. We expect to strengthen our ties with a number of other departments and programs.\" Former Woodrow Wilson School students who have become prominent in public life include: G. Mennen Wil\u00ad liams '33, six times governor of Michi\u00ad gan; John B. Oakes '34, New York Times editorial page editor; Francis L. Van Dusen '34, district court judge; J. Harlan Cleveland '38, assistant secre\u00ad tary of state, and later ambassador to NATO; William E. Colby '40, director of the Central Intelligence Agency; Claiborne Pell '40, senator from Rhode Island; George P. Shultz '42, secretary of the treasury; Nicholas de B. Kat- zenbach '43, under secretary of state, and later attorney-general; John Doar '44, special counsel of the House JOHN WITHERSPOON 523 Judiciary Committee; Paul Volcker '49, under secretary of the treasury, and later president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Donald B. Easum MPA '50, assistant secretary of state, and later ambassador to Nigeria; Alex\u00ad ander B. Trowbridge '51, secretary of commerce; Ralph A. Dungan, Jr., MPA '52, ambassador to Chile, and later chancellor, Department of Higher Education of the State of New Jersey; W. Michael Blumenthal MPA '53, chairman of the Bendix Corporation, and later secretary of the treasury; Paul S. Sarbanes '54, senator from Mary\u00ad land; Ralph Nader '55, consumer advo\u00ad cate. THE WOODROW WILSON SCHOOL BUILDING The most striking feature of Minoru Yamasaki's design is provided by fifty- eight elegantly tapered pillars that give a feeling of lightness and grace to the building they surround. These white, quartz-surfaced pillars support the top floor of the building, permitting the use on the first floor of non-bearing walls of travertine marble and allowing a free\u00ad dom of space within. The main story, which is twenty- eight feet high, contains a well-lit and comfortable lobby-lounge extending the width of the building, a bowl- shaped auditorium seating 200, a li\u00ad brary with two mezzanine levels con\u00ad taining student carrels, and a dining room. On the lower floor, which is below ground level, are conference, seminar, and lecture rooms, and on the upper floor, faculty offices and smaller lounges. The lobby-lounge contains an abstract sculpture, \"The World, 1964,\" by Harry Bertoia and bronze busts of Woodrow Wilson by Jo Davidson and of Adlai E. Stevenson by Ellen Simon. In the plaza to the north is a reflecting pool and a twenty-foot-high bronze \"Fountain of Freedom\" by James Fitzgerald. Witherspoon, John (1723-1794), was the sixth president of Princeton, a signer of the Declaration of Independ\u00ad ence, and from 1776 to 1782 a leading member of the Continental Congress. He came from Scotland in 1768 to as\u00ad sume the presidency of the college and held office until his death a quarter of a century later. A graduate of the University of Edin\u00ad burgh, who received an honorary doc\u00ad torate from St. Andrews in 1764, With\u00ad erspoon had become widely known as a leader of the evangelical or \"Popular Party\" in the established Church of Scotland, of which he was an ordained minister. The trustees of the College first elected him president in 1766, after Samuel Finley's death; but Mrs. Witherspoon was reluctant to leave Scotland, and he declined. Thanks very largely to the efforts of Benjamin Rush 1760, then a medical student at Edin\u00ad burgh, she was persuaded to recon\u00ad sider. Informed that Witherspoon would now accept the call if renewed, the trustees again elected him to the presidency in December of 1767. With their five surviving children (five others had died in early child\u00ad hood), and 300 books for the college library, the Witherspoons reached Philadelphia early in August 1768. When a few days later they moved on to Princeton, they were greeted a mile out of town by tutors and students, who escorted them to Morven, home of Richard Stockton. That evening the students celebrated the occasion by \"il\u00ad luminating\" Nassau Hall with a lighted tallow dip in each window. Witherspoon had arrived in time to 524 JOHN WITHERSPOON provide the highlight for commence\u00ad ment, which in those days was held in September. Early in October, he wrote Rush that on the preceding 28th he had delivered \"an inaugural Oration in Latin\" before \"a vast Concourse of People.\" He was obviously heartened by the warmth of his reception, but he also reported a number of disturbing conditions in the state of the college. He found far too many of the students inadequately prepared for college work, a complaint frequently heard since, and one that explains the close attention he subsequently gave to the grammar school conducted by the col\u00ad lege. Most worrisome of all was the low state of the college's finances. With characteristic vigor, Wither- spoon moved immediately to find the remedy. Taking advantage of the vaca\u00ad tion between commencement and the beginning of a new term in November, he went first to New York and then on to Boston for consultation with friends of the College. During the next fall's vacation, he visited Williamsburg, where, the Virginia Gazette reported, he \"preached to a crowded audience in the Capital yard (there being no house in town capable of holding such a mul\u00ad titude) and gave universal satisfaction.\" The concrete measure of that satisfac\u00ad tion was a collection taken at the end of the sermon amounting \"to upwards of fifty-six pounds.\" The following Febru\u00ad ary found him again in Virginia, and this was not the last of his southern tours. By no means the least of the advan\u00ad tages that accrued to the College from his itinerant preaching was an in\u00ad creased enrollment of students, whose tuition continued to be the major source of revenue. Enrollment had reached a peak under President Finley, with graduating classes of 31 each in 1765 and 1766, but had fallen off there\u00ad after. There were 11 graduates at the commencement of 1768, but 29 in 1773, and 27 in 1776. Simultaneously, a change occurred in the constituencies from which the students were drawn. Now, as before, most of them came from the middle provinces, but the representation from New England, which had been substantial, declined markedly, and a significant enrollment from the southern colonies began to develop. Not all of Witherspoon's preaching was done on the road. Indeed, when in Princeton he normally preached twice each Sunday to a mixed congregation of townspeople and students, which only recently had acquired a place of wor\u00ad ship apart from the Prayer Room of Nassau Hall. Their church had been constructed at the front of the present campus, where stands today a Presby\u00ad terian church of much later construc\u00ad tion. According to Benjamin Rush, Witherspoon's manner in the pulpit was \"solemn and graceful,\" his voice melodious, and his sermons \"loaded with good sense and adorned\" with \"elegance and beauty\" of expression. But Rush was impressed above all by the fact that Witherspoon carried no notes into the pulpit, in sharp contrast with the \"too common practice of read\u00ad ing sermons in America.\" Other con\u00ad temporary descriptions indicate that he depended upon no oratorical flourishes or gestures. The story is told of a visitor who, observing that Witherspoon's en\u00ad thusiasm for gardening was confined to growing vegtables, remarked, \"Doctor, I see no flowers in your garden,\" to which came the reply, \"No, nor in my discourses either.\" To the day of his death, his speech revealed his Scottish birth. A man of medium height, tending toward stout-JOHN WITHERSPOON 525 ness, with bushy eyebrows, a promi\u00ad nent nose, and large ears, he had a quality contemporaries were inclined to describe as \"presence.\" One of his students, a later president of the Col\u00ad lege, recalled that Witherspoon had more presence than any other man he had known, except for General Wash\u00ad ington. Witherspoon lived at first in the President's House (now called the John Maclean House), but after several years he moved about a mile north of the vil\u00ad lage to \"Tusculum,\" a handsome resi\u00ad dence he built that still stands on Cherry Hill Road. His route to and from the College is well enough indi\u00ad cated by the street that bears his name. President Witherspoon was obvi\u00ad ously a very busy man, for in addition to managing the College's affairs and preaching twice on Sundays, he bore the heaviest responsibility for instruc\u00ad tion of the students. His \"faculty\" nor\u00ad mally included two or three tutors (re\u00ad cent graduates who may have been pursuing, in such free time as they could find, advanced studies in divinity before moving on to some vacant pul\u00ad pit) and one, later two, professors. Considering himself less than an ac\u00ad complished scholar in mathematics and astronomy, he secured the appoint\u00ad ment of a Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in 1771. This left to the president the main responsibility for instruction in moral philosophy, di\u00ad vinity, rhetoric, history, and chronol\u00ad ogy, and also in French, for such stu\u00ad dents as might elect to study the lan\u00ad guage. Witherspoon's administration marks an important turning point in the life of the college, but the changes he made were mainly of method and emphasis within the broad objectives which had been originally set. Thus, he brought to Princeton a fresh emphasis upon the need of the church for a well educated clergy, a purpose to which the college had been dedicated at the time of its founding, but by men who at the height of a stirring religious revival may well have given first place to the church's need for a \"converted\" ministry. There is no indication that Witherspoon dis\u00ad counted the importance of a conversion experience, but on balance he tended to place the primary emphasis on edu\u00ad cation. His influence in helping to bring about a final reunion of all Pres\u00ad byterians, who earlier had been sharply divided, in support of the College was one of his major accomplishments. The founders had hoped too that the College might produce men who would be \"ornaments of the State as well as the Church,\" and Witherspoon realized this hope in full measure. His students included, in addition to a president and vice-president of the United States, nine cabinet officers, twenty-one senators, thirty-nine congressmen, three justices of the Supreme Court, and twelve state governors. Five of the nine Princeton graduates among the fifty-five members of the Constitutional Convention of 1787 were students of Witherspoon. Witherspoon broadened and en\u00ad riched the curriculum of the College. He was the first to introduce the new rhetoric of the eighteenth century, ac\u00ad complishing his purpose by extending and intensifying instruction in English grammar and composition. He added substantially to the instructional equipment of the College, especially books for the library and \"philosophical apparatus\" for instruction by demon\u00ad stration in the sciences, including the famous Rittenhouse Orrery acquired in 1771. He was not an original thinker, but he was a product of Scotland's leading 526 JOHN WITHERSPOON university in an age when the Scottish universities had a vitality possessed by no others in Great Britain. Although certain leniencies encouraged by the Scottish Enlightenment had offended his orthodox Presbyterianism, With- erspoon introduced to Princeton, and through it to other institutions, some of the more advanced ideas of that move\u00ad ment. He subscribed to John Locke's view of the role of sensory perception in the development of the mind, but vigorously rejected all esoteric in\u00ad terpretations of that view. He saw no conflict between faith and reason; in\u00ad stead,\u00b7 he encouraged his students to test their faith by the rule of experi\u00ad ence. He was much inclined to apply the test of common sense to any propo\u00ad sition, and to reduce it to its simplest terms. In lecturing on rhetoric he ad\u00ad vised his students of the multiple com\u00ad ponents into which a discourse tradi\u00ad tionally had been divided, and then suggested that it was enough to say that every discourse or composition \"must have a beginning, a middle, and an end.\" His name is rightly identified with certain attitudes and assumptions, considered to be of importance in the development of our national life, that are associated with what is known as the Common Sense Philosophy. Though a man of strong convictions, he showed no inclination to protect his students from exposure to ideas with which he disagreed. The many books he added to the library gave the under\u00ad graduate access to a wide range of con\u00ad temporary literature, including authors with whom he had publicly disputed. In his famous lectures on moral philos\u00ad ophy, not published until after his death and then probably contrary to his wish, his method was to lay out con\u00ad tending points of view and to rely upon persuasive reasoning to guide the stu\u00addent toward a proper conclusion of his own. Witherspoon had a helpful sense of humor. He suffered from insomnia, and his tendency to drowse, particularly after dinner, led him, during one of the two terms he served in the New Jersey legislature, to move that the daily ses\u00ad sions be concluded before dinner. When his motion lost, he informed his colleagues that \"there are two kinds of speaking that are very interesting . . . perfect sense and perfect nonsense. When there is speaking in either of these ways I shall engage to be all at\u00ad tention. But when there is speaking, as there often is, halfway between sense and nonsense, you must bear with me if I fall asleep.\" In his support of the American cause there is no occasion for surprise. He subscribed to John Locke's political philosophy as wholeheartedly as to his psychology, and brought from Scotland a strong sense of \"British liberty,\" which he came to see as greatly en\u00ad dangered by the course of British pol\u00ad icy. When John Adams stopped over in Princeton on his way to the first meet\u00ad ing of the Continental Congress in 1774, he met Witherspoon and pro\u00ad nounced him \"as high a Son of Liberty, as any Man in America.\" Through the years he served in Con\u00ad gress, Witherspoon's patriotism and judgment won the respect of his col\u00ad leagues, as evidenced by his assign\u00ad ment to many committees, some of them among the most important. He struggled through these years\u2014not al\u00ad ways successfully\u2014to keep the College in session, and he became a frequent commuter between Princeton and Philadelphia. He resigned from Con\u00ad gress in November 1782, when a war that had cost him the life of his son James (who graduated from the College WOMEN 527 in 1770 and was killed in German town) was ended, and peace, with American independence, seemed assured. Witherspoon's later years were filled with difficulty. The college had suffered extensive damage to its building and in\u00ad structional equipment, and its finances were in disarray. Two years before his death he became totally blind. His wife died in 1789, and a second marriage in 1791 to a young widow of twenty-four occasioned more than a little comment. Through these later years his son-in- law, Samuel Stanhope Smith, increas\u00ad ingly carried the responsibility for con\u00ad duct of the College's affairs. But through these later years, too, Witherspoon remained remarkably ac\u00ad tive and influential. He was a member of the ratifying convention that brought to New Jersey the honor of being the third state to ratify the Constitution of the United States. He contributed greatly to the organization of a newly independent and national Presbyterian Church, and in 1789 opened its first General Assembly with a sermon and presided until the election of the first moderator. Above all, the name he had won as a divine, an educator, and a patriot brought returning strength to the College. He is rightly remembered as one of the great presidents of Princeton. W. Frank Craven Witherspoon Hall was named in honor of Princeton's sixth president John Witherspoon. At the time of its comple\u00ad tion in 1877, it was considered the most beautiful and luxurious college dormi\u00ad tory in the country. One of its first occu\u00ad pants was Woodrow Wilson, who moved into room no. 7 in the west entry at the beginning of the second term of his sophomore year and lived there until his graduation in 1879. Women have played a varied and sig\u00ad nificant part in the life of Princeton from the beginning. Esther Burr, whose marriage at twenty-one to the second president when he was thirty- six created a stir among the students, has added feminine insight to what we know of the College's early years through the pages of her diary. Annis Stockton, wife of the first graduate trus\u00ad tee of the College, had the distinction of being the only woman on the rolls of the American Whig Society, which gratefully voted her honorary member\u00ad ship because she safeguarded Johnson's Dictionary, brass andirons and candle sticks, and other Society treasures dur\u00ad ing the Revolution. She was also cele\u00ad brated for the verses she wrote to Gen\u00ad eral Washington while he was in Princeton for meetings of the Conti\u00ad nental Congress (asking, in one: \"Say; can a female voice an audience gain? / And Stop a moment thy triumphal Car. . .\"). Two wives of latter-day presidents made contributions to the University's welfare that have been perpetuated through the work of like-minded women of succeeding generations. Isabella McCosh, wife of the eleventh president, ministered to the health of students and is memorialized in the in\u00ad firmary that bears her name (q.v.); her example has been emulated over the years by members of the infirmary's Ladies Auxiliary. A similar influence has been exerted by the University League (q.v.), founded in 1920 by Jen\u00ad ny Davidson Hibben, wife of the four\u00ad teenth president, \"to provide a friendly spirit among the wives and families of men connected with the University.\" Wives of deans similarly contributed to the quality of life in the University. Long before Princeton had a music de\u00ad partment, Philena Fobes Fine, wife of 528 WOMEN the third dean of the faculty, pioneered in bringing outstanding musical per\u00ad formers to Princeton, and when she died in 1928 her friends endowed a fund in her name to help carry on the program of concerts she had initiated. Wives of faculty members, though lacking faculty status, often collabo\u00ad rated with their husbands in their scholarly activities. One of them, Mar\u00ad garet Farrand Thorp, who worked with her English-department husband, was the author of a book of special interest in this context: Female Persuasion: Six Strong-Minded Women. Another woman used her handiwork to beautify the campus. Beatrix Far- rand's contribution as consulting land\u00ad scape gardener for thirty years is com\u00ad memorated by an inscription on a bench near the Chapel: \"Her love of beauty and order is everywhere visible in what she planted for our delight.\" Daughters of alumni got their educa\u00ad tions\u2014and made their contribu\u00ad tions\u2014elsewhere. A notable example was Sylvia Beach (daughter of a graduate of 1876), who published the first edition of James Joyce's Ulysses from her renowned Paris bookshop Shakespeare and Company in 1922, thus earning the gratitude of students of literature everywhere and the par\u00ad ticular pride of Princeton, which has the bulk of her papers in the Firestone Library's Sylvia Beach Collection. With the coming of shorthand, the typewriter, the telephone, and the growing complexity of administrative procedures, the contribution of women to the management of University affairs took on increasing importance as women assistants and women secre\u00ad taries became indispensable helpmates of presidents, deans, professors, and others. A conspicuous example in ear\u00ad lier years was Anna B. H. Creasey, a \"strong-minded\" woman who ruled the Graduate School office in Nassau Hall with the same magisterial air with which Dean West presided over the Graduate College and was accordingly nicknamed Dean East by graduate stu\u00ad dents. During the years after World War II, when secretarial help was in short supply, the University was able to meet its needs with the services of graduate student wives who toiled to supplement their husbands' G.I. ben\u00ad efits (leading one observer to declare that many a student earned his Ph.D. by \"the sweat of his frau\"). Women thus filled a variety of useful roles in Princeton life long before they were accorded full faculty or student status. Although the first woman full professor was not appointed until 1968, when sociologist Suzanne Keller was given that rank, women were discharg\u00ad ing research and teaching respon\u00ad sibilities as long ago as the 1930s when the distinguished demographer Irene Taeuber began her career as a research associate in the Population Research Section, and the 1940s when a number of departments began adding women to their staffs to help meet increased stu\u00ad dent demand for foreign-language in\u00ad struction. A first step toward the admission of women as students had been taken as far back as 1887 with the founding of the quasi-coordinate Evelyn College for Women (q.v.), which encouraged Harper's Bazaar to look forward to the day when \"our country shall come to speak with equal pride of the sons and daughters of Princeton.\" But the new college, falling on hard times after the Panic of 1893, had to close its doors in 1897, and almost another three- quarters of a century would pass before Harper's prophecy could be fulfilled. A modest extension of Princeton's WOMEN 529 educational opportunities for women came in World War II when twenty- three were admitted to a government- sponsored defense course in photo- grammetry. More significant changes occurred in the 1960s with the admis\u00ad sion of women graduate students (the first Ph.D. was awarded in 1964), and the admission each year of several dozen young women for a year of con\u00ad centrated study in \"critical languages.\" The day before the 1967 Com\u00ad mencement the Board of Trustees au\u00ad thorized a careful investigation of \"the advisability and the feasibility of Princeton's entering significantly into the education of women at the under\u00ad graduate level.\" At the exercises next day the unexpected appearance of a pretty brown-haired girl, who had been smuggled into the academic procession in cap and gown by a graduating senior friend, prompted President Goheen to interrupt his formal announcement of the trustees' decision to note that one young woman had already \"worked her way\" into Princeton's midst. A ten-member committee, headed by Economics Professor Gardner Pat\u00ad terson, thereupon conducted a 16- month study and produced an exten\u00ad sive report which, according to Presi\u00ad dent Goheen, offered evidence that \"the presence of talented young women at Princeton would enhance the total educational experience and contribute to a better balanced social and intellec\u00ad tual life.\" It would also help \"sustain Princeton's ability to attract outstand\u00ad ing students,\" while providing a Princeton education for young women \"\" who could be expected \"to make worthy contributions to the national life, where clearly women are, and will be, taking increasingly active parts.\" A special trustees' committee, headed by Harold H. Helm '20, worked with administration and faculty representatives to test the findings and recommendations of the Patterson Re\u00ad port while meetings were being held in twenty-five cities for discussion of the report with alumni. One such meeting, conducted by the Princeton Area Alumni Association in McCosh 50, pro\u00ad duced a long and lively discussion. To\u00ad ward the end of the evening an alum\u00ad nus clergyman took as his text Genesis II, 18: \"And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone,\" adding that since the hour was late and there was not time for a ser\u00ad mon, he would simply say that it ap\u00ad peared that God favored the Patterson Report. In January 1969 the Helm committee recommended to the board that Princeton undertake the education of women at the undergraduate level. It gave two reasons: first, that both Princeton faculty and Princeton alumni engaged in higher education elsewhere now believed that \"the educational ex\u00ad perience is improved . . . when it is car\u00ad ried out in mixed, rather than single- sex, circumstances,\" and second, that the general shift toward a favorable view of coeducation among younger alumni and faculty, combined with the clear preference of today's students, seemed to them \"to have very impor\u00ad tant implications for Princeton's fu\u00ad ture. \" The trustees, by a vote of 24 to 8, ap\u00ad proved coeducation in principle and in\u00ad structed the administration to develop plans for its implementation. An ad hoc faculty-administration-student commit\u00ad tee, appointed and presided over by the president made an intensive study of all aspects of conversion, including the relative merits of coordinate versus coeducational arrangements; all of its members came to be convinced that if 530 WOMEN properly worked out, coeducational ar\u00ad rangements would be \"both better educationally and generally more eco\u00ad nomical.\" The committee's implementation plans were approved by the trustees in April, and President Goheen an\u00ad nounced that coeducation would be\u00ad come a reality in September. The Prince congratulated the trustees on their \"courage, foresight, and ability to change with the times,\" and WPRB concluded its broadcast of the news with the Hallelujah Chorus. During the first weekend after Labor Day in 1969, a pioneering band of 171 women arrived in Princeton as candi\u00ad dates for bachelor degrees; among them were 101 members of the freshman Class of 1973 looking forward to full Princeton careers along with their 820 male classmates. Four years later, on Commencement eve, the New York Times highlighted some of the achievements of the women in Princeton's first coeducational class. One of them, Marsha H. Levy, was the first woman to win the Pyne Prize and the first to be elected an alumni trus\u00ad tee. Princeton's only Marshall scholarship winner was a woman, as was one of its three Fulbright recip\u00ad ients. Princeton women had fielded undefeated teams in tennis, squash, and swimming, and the women's crew, which practiced daily at 6:30 a. m., had won the Eastern championship in 1972. Marjorie Gengler, captain of the undefeated tennis team, never lost a set in her intercollegiate career, and later became Annual Giving's first woman class agent. In his concluding remarks at the 1973 Commencement President Bowen de\u00ad clared, \"The women among us have now added their gifts of fallibility to our own, and I think we are a far better university\u2014and a far richer community of people\u2014for them.\" Women continued to excel in schol\u00ad arship the 1975 Com\u00ad was salutatorian and Cynthia Chase '75 valedictorian\u2014the first time women had won both honors. A year later Emily Goodfellow '76 became the first Princetonian to win twelve varsity let\u00ad ters, four each in field hockey, squash, and lacrosse. That December, Suzanne Perles '75 of Anchorage, Alaska, was one of the first thirteen American women chosen as Rhodes Scholars. In 1976, Nancy B. Peretsman '76 be\u00ad came the second woman to be elected alumni trustee, bringing the number of women on the Board to four, Mary St. John Douglas and Susan Savage Speers having been elected charter trustees in 1971. Although the curricular interests of women in the first coeducational class covered a wide range in the liberal arts and sciences, none of them chose an engineering program. By the spring of 1976, however, thanks to the new di\u00ad rections engineering was taking in America and to the Engineering School's strenuous efforts at recruit\u00ad ment, nearly 14 percent of the Uni\u00ad versity's engineering students were women, compared to a national average of less than 5 percent. The proportion of women in the un\u00ad dergraduate body as a whole also rose substantially and continued to rise after the trustees removed an earlier quota by adopting, in 1974, a policy of equal access. By 1976, the undergraduate body numbered 1,395 women and 2,965 men. Among graduate students, the pro\u00ad portion of women also rose\u2014by 1976 there were 367 in a total student body of 1,415. WPRB 531 In 1977 Nina G. Garsoian became Dean of the Graduate School and Joan S. Girgus, Dean of the College\u2014the first women to hold Princeton's second and third oldest deanships. Woolworth Center of Musical Studies was constructed in 1963. It was largely the gift of Frasier McCann '30 and his sister, Mrs. Helena McCann Charlton, and was named in memory of their grandfather, Frank Winfield Wool- worth. Other donors gave some of the rooms, which are marked by memorial plaqjies. In addition to classrooms and offices, Woolworth contains a record library and listening rooms, individual and en\u00ad semble practice rooms, studios for pri\u00ad vate lessons, and a rehearsal room that is also used for small student concerts. Moore & Hutchins, of New York, were the architects; Bolt, Beranek & Newman, of Cambridge, Massachu\u00ad setts, the accoustical consultants. A bronze plaque in the entranceway pays tribute to the two men whose dreams and work culminated in the Woolworth Center: Roy Dickinson Welch (1885-1951) founding chairman of the Department of Music, and Paul Bedford 1897, trustee and benefactor. WPRB, undergraduate radio station, first known as WPRU, was founded in 1940, just twenty years after public broadcasting was introduced in the United States by Station KDKA in Pittsburgh. Henry G. Theis '42 organ\u00ad ized the Princeton station in his room in 441 Pyne Hall, using the University's electric wiring system to conduct re\u00ad corded music, news of sports events, and local advertising to campus listen\u00ad ers three hours daily. Another member of the original staff, James G. Robinson '43, an electrical engineer, helped guide the development of the station as chairman of its governing board for over twenty years. In 1955, fifteen years after its found\u00ad ing, WPRU obtained a license to build an FM transmitter and became the first student-owned and operated FM sta\u00ad tion in the country. From an antenna on top of Holder Tower it beamed a 250-watt signal to potential listeners within a radius of twenty miles, while continuing to broadcast simultaneously to the campus on the A.M. dial. Its new status as a licensed station required a change in name when it was discovered that a ship at sea was using the same call letters. It accordingly changed from its Princeton University- derived WPRU to a Princeton Broad\u00ad casting Service-derived WPRB. 1960\u2014its twentieth anniversary year\u2014WPRB asked the Federal Com\u00ad munications Commission for authority to increase its power from 250 watts to 1,000 on the frequency it was using. Its application was denied but it was in\u00ad formed that another frequency, carry\u00ad ing 17,000 watts, was available. WPRB applied, and when the application was granted, it borrowed $10,000 for equipment, and became one of the most powerful FM stations in New Jer\u00ad sey. At first WPRB had trouble control\u00ad ling its new-found power. Nearby radio users complained that it was blanketing out half the FM dial. A freshman claimed that he was picking up its music on his electric shoe polisher; an older citizen of the borough, that he was hearing it on his false teeth. These difficulties were eventually ameliorated and some relief granted close neigh\u00ad bors; at the same time, the station was making new friends as far distant as Philadelphia and Greenwich, Connec\u00ad ticut. 532 WRESTLING One profitable consequence of WPRB's new 17,000-watt signal was its interference with the programs of Sta\u00ad tion WTFM in Lake Success, Long Is\u00ad land. WTFM offered WPRB $5,000 and technical assistance if it would change its frequency from 103.5 to 103.3. WPRB replied that it would make the change, without any technical assistance, for $10,000 and WTFM agreed. In 1962, with the approval of the F.C. C, the change was made and the proceeds used a year later for pur\u00ad chase of equipment that enabled WPRB to become the first college sta\u00ad tion in the United States to engage in stereo broadcasting. By the mid-seventies, WPRB was utilizing the energies of about a hundred undergraduates in its pro\u00ad gram, business, technical, and public relations departments to provide an es\u00ad timated audience of 45,000, in a five- state area, with the same basic ingre\u00ad dients it had given its campus listeners in 1940\u2014music, sports, advertising\u2014 along with more diverse elements added over the years\u2014national news, public affairs programs, university pub\u00ad lic lectures, chapel services, and live concerts in stereo. Typical of the staff's enthusiasm for their work was a ban\u00ad ner in the station manager's office crocheted by one of the women mem\u00ad bers, reading \"God Bless WPRB.\" A number of WPRB alumni have gone on to professional careers in broadcasting, including former station manager Paul Friedman '66, who be\u00ad came producer of NBC's Today Show. Wrestling did not begin as an intercol\u00ad legiate sport at Princeton until early in this century, although freshmen and sophomores had been practicing a Princeton variant, the cane spree, since the close of the Civil War. Originally, this involved a series of rough-and- tumble bouts between freshmen sport\u00ad ing forbidden canes, and sophomores trying to wrest them away. Later, three specially trained representatives of the freshman and sophomore classes\u2014 light, middle, and heavyweight\u2014wres\u00ad tled for possession of a cane. In the early 1900s the cane spree inspired fresh\u00ad men-sophomore wrestling matches, which in turn led in 1905 to the forma\u00ad tion of the first varsity wrestling team. In the second year of Varsity compe\u00ad tition, Donald G. Herring '07 won the intercollegiate heavyweight cham\u00ad pionship in record time, throwing one opponent in sixteen seconds, another in thirteen. He was a dapper heavy\u00ad weight, sometimes appearing at profes\u00ad sional wrestling matches in Newark in white tie, tails, and topper. Five years later, in 1911, Princeton won the Eastern intercollegite team championship when George W. Prettyman Tl, Franklin C. Wells, Jr. '11, Alexander T. Ormond, Jr. '12, and Jacob H. Frantz '13 took four of the six individual titles. Ormond's brother, Harold H. Ormond 12, won an indi\u00ad vidual championship in 1912 as did Harold H. GiIe '15 in 1913. The 1911 welterweight champion Jacob Frantz (twice a cane-spree winner) success\u00ad fully defended his intercollegiate title in 1912 and 1913 to become Princeton's first three-time champion. Frantz had but one hold\u2014the front chancery and bar lock\u2014but he was very proficient at it and lost no time in applying it to his opponent after the customary opening handshake. In three years of varsity competition he was never thrown; the only match he did not win was lost by a close decision; all the others he won by falls. In the twenties four Princetonians won Eastern intercollegiate individual WALTER AUGUSTUS WYCKOFF 533 championships: Charles CJ. Carpenter '21, Robert Morrison V. Buttrey '26, and William A. Graham '29. Heavyweight champion Carpenter, later Protestant Episcopal Bishop of Georgia, further distinguished himself by scoring a technical victory in a hand\u00ad icap match with the professional wres\u00ad tler \"Strangler\" Lewis. Buttrey and Graham won their titles under Clarence F. Foster, who coached from 1924 through 1934. Other Eastern intercollegiate champions coached by Foster were William D. Barfield '30, Russell H. Hooker '34, and Thomas Snelham '35, as well as Julian Gregory Jr. '35 and George B. Treide '36, who both went on to win second cham\u00ad pionships under Foster's successor, Jimmie Reed. A former two-time Eastern intercol\u00ad legiate champion at Lehigh, Reed was varsity coach for thirty years through 1964. His 1936 and 1937 teams were undefeated, and his 1938 team won seven successive meets before losing their final encounter with Lehigh, thus extending Princeton's unbroken string of victories to twenty-one. The 1937 and 1938 teams took second place in the Eastern intercollegiates, and the 1941 team tied Yale for first place. Reed's wrestlers won the Big Three title in the years from 1936 through 1939, from 1941 through 1943, and in 1947, 1949, 1950, 1953, and 1957. Reed's roster of Eastern intercol\u00ad legiate champions was impressive. One, Bradley M. Glass '53, also won the 1951 NCAA heavyweight cham\u00ad pionship, Princeton's first national title. Richard B. Harding '40 and Robert C. Eberle '41 won Eastern championships in each of their three years of varsity competition. Charles A. Powers '38, who won twice, was awarded the coaches' cup as the most accomplished wrestler in the 1937 Eastern cham\u00ad pionship meet. W. Eugene Taylor '43 and Bradley Glass were also double winners. Other Eastern champions were Morris S. Emory '38, Charles H. Toll, Jr. '38, and David A. Poor '50. John Johnston, a former national champion at Penn State, succeeded Jimmie Reed as coach in 1965, and Princeton soon became a formidable power in Ivy competition, winning sole possession of the League crown in 1967, 1970, and 1971, sharing it with Penn in 1972 and with Cornell in 1973, and winning it outright again in 1975, 1977 and, with a phenomenal 19-0 sea\u00ad son record, in 1978, when it also won the Eastern intercollegiate tournament. In 1972, Emil A. Deliere '72 won the Eastern intercollegiate championship in the 190-pound class, and reached the finals of the NCAA championship tour\u00ad nament, where the recurrence of a back injury compelled him to default. Cap\u00ad tain John Sefter '78 won the Eastern in\u00ad tercollegiate championship in the heavyweight class in 1977 and 1978, and reached the finals of the NCAA championship tournament in 1978. Steve Grubman '78 won the Eastern in\u00ad tercollegiate championship in the 142- Ib. class in 1978, and the same year, along with Keith Ely '79 in the 177-lb. class, reached the quarter-finals of the NCAA championship tournament. One of Princeton's strongest com\u00ad petitors was Donald Rumsfeld '54, who reached the finals of the Eastern inter\u00ad collegiates in the 157-pound class his junior year and the semi-finals as cap\u00ad tain in his undefeated senior year, and who later became congressman from Il\u00ad linois, ambassador to NATO, and secre\u00ad tary of defense. Wyckoff, Walter Augustus (1865-1908), who gave Princeton's first course in 534 WYMAN HOUSE sociology, was born in India of mission\u00ad ary parents. As a Princeton under\u00ad graduate, he was College champion in the mile run and gave the Ivy Oration at the 1888 Commencement: \"Today we are young and gay with no thought of care; tomorrow we are borne out into a fuller experience of life's realities.\" Three years later, Wyckoff set out with a dollar in his pocket to learn firsthand the life of the unskilled worker. In the course of eighteen months he worked his way as a day laborer from Connec\u00ad ticut to California, much of it on foot. Later, while a lecturer in sociology and then an assistant professor of political economy, he published a two-volume account of his experiences, The Work\u00ad ers: an Experiment in Reality (1897 and 1898). Wyckoff was a popular teacher. His students called him \"Weary Willie,\" and attributed to him, perhaps apoc- ryphally, this definition: \"A hobo is a migratory worker; a tramp is a migra\u00ad tory nonworker; a bum is a nonmigra- tory nonworker.\" Wyckoff's career was cut short by an aneurism of the aorta at the age of forty-three. A bronze tablet erected in an East Pyne archway by his classmates honors him as \"a lover of mankind, an adventurous traveler who wrote out of his own experience, taught with his heart in his message, and died in peace and welldoing.\" Wyman House, the residence of the dean of the graduate school, was built in 1913 at the same time as the Graduate College, which it adjoins. It was named for Isaac C. Wyman, Class of 1848, of Salem, Massachusetts, who left the University his residuary estate of some $800,000 for the development of the Graduate College as \"a memorial of my lasting affection and interest in my Alma Mater.\" Over the fireplace in the Dean's library are hung the long- barreled flintlock musket and powder horn that Wyman's grandfather used in the French and Indian Wars and which his father, as a boy of sixteen, carried in the Revolutionary battle of Princeton. Part of the fighting was on ground now occupied by the Graduate College. Young, Charles Augustus (1834-1908) was born in Hanover, New Hampshire, of a family long connected with Dartmouth College. He graduated from Dartmouth, at eighteen, at the head of his class. When he was thirty- one, he was appointed to a professor\u00ad ship of science at Dartmouth previously held by his father and his maternal grandfather; eleven years later he ac\u00ad cepted a call to Princeton to succeed Stephen Alexander (q. v.) as professor of astronomy and to become first director of the Observatory. Young was an authority on the sun and a pioneer in spectrum analysis. He devised the automatic spectroscope, which later came into general use, and his observations led to an improved list of important features of the spectrum of the sun. He organized expeditions to different parts of the world to observe solar eclipses, on one of them observing for the first time the reversal of the lines of the solar spectrum\u2014the \"re\u00ad versing layer\"\u2014for which he received the Janssen Medal of the French Academy of Sciences. He also made the first good quantitative determination of the rate of rotation of the sun. He served a term as president of the American Association for the Ad\u00ad vancement of Science. His book The Sun (1881) went into numerous editions and was translated into several languages; his four text-CHARLES AUGUSTUS YOUNG 535 books, which were widely used, were generally considered to be among the best in astronomy ever written. His teaching was also, according to his most brilliant student, Henry Norris Russell (q.v.), \"superb.\" Young was admired by under\u00ad graduates, who called him \"Twinkle\" (as much for the bright, kindly flash of his eye as for his subject), and by the faculty, who thought him \"in gifts and character . . . the ideal man of science.\" At Commencement in 1905, the year he retired, the trustees gave him an honorary LL. D., and the students rose and gave him a triple cheer. The day he died\u2014January 3, 1908\u2014 at his family home in Hanover, New Hampshire, there was a total eclipse of the sun.
