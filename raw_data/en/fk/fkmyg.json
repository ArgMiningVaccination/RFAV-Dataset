This Policy contains many important terms (such as \"Medically Necessary\" and \"Covered Service\") that a re defined in the section entitled \"Definitions.\" Befo re reading through this Policy, be sure that You un derstand the meanings of these words as they pertain to this Policy. We provide coverage to You under this Policy based upon the answers submitted by You and Your Family Member(s) on Your signed individual application.

However, non-Emergency Services fr om a Non-Participating Provider are not covered by this Policy. PAINDEPO052021 Cigna Connect 1250 Enhanced Diabet es Care MIEP0874 MIEP0875 MIEP0877 2 THIS IS AN EXCLUSIVE PROVIDER POLICY That means this Policy does not provide benefits fo r any services you receive from an Out-of-Network P rovider except: Services for Stabilization and initial treatment o f an Emergency Medical Condition, or Medically Necessary services that are not availabl e through an In-Network Provider. In-Network Providers include Physicians, Hospitals, and Other Health Care Facilities. Check the provid er directory, available at www.mycigna.com, or call th e number on your ID card to determine if a Provider is In- Network. Choosing a Primary Care Physician (PCP) A Primary Care Physician may serve an important rol e in meeting health care needs by providing or arranging for medical care for each Insured Person. For this reason, when you enroll as an Insured Person, you will be asked to select a Primary Care Physician (\"PCP\"). Your PCP will provide your regul ar medical care and assist in coordinating your care. You may select your PCP by calling the customer ser vice phone number on your ID card or by visiting Our web site at www.mycigna.com. The Primary Care Physician You select for Yourself may be different from the P rimary Care Physician You select for each of Your Family Member(s). You have the right to designate a ny Primary Care Physician who participates in Our network for this plan and is available to accept Yo u or Your Family Members. If You Need a Specialist Your PCP is important to the coordination of your c are. While this Policy does not require referrals t o visit specialists, if you need specialty care you are enc ouraged to work with your PCP, who can coordinate y our care and assist you in selecting a specialist appro priate for your care. The referral system can be used to keep your PCP in volved in and apprised of all of your health care n eeds. If you receive Covered Services from a specialist i n the Policy's network without a referral, you will not be subject to a penalty, and the claims for those Cove red Services will be processed according to the app licable In-Network level of benefits. Changing Primary Care Physicians You may voluntarily change your PCP but not more th an once in any calendar month. We reserve the right to determine the number of times during a plan Year that you will be allowed to change your PCP. You m ay request a change from one Primary Care Physician to another by going to www.mycigna.com, clicking on \"Manage My Health Team,\" click \"Additional info on PCP selection,\" and follow the directions displa yed or by contacting Us at the customer service number on your ID card. In addition, if at any time a Primary Care Physicia n ceases to be a Participating Provider, We will no tify you 30 days in advance, for the purpose of selectin g a new Primary Care Physician. If Your Physician Leaves the Network If your PCP or specialist ceases to be a Participat ing Physician, We will notify you in writing of his or her impending termination at least 30 days in advance o f the date the PCP leaves the network and provide assistance in selecting a new PCP or identifying a new specialist to continue providing Covered Servic es. If you are receiving treatment from a Participating Pr ovider at the time his or her Participating Provide r agreement is terminated, for reasons other than med ical incompetence or professional misconduct, you m ay be eligible for continued care with that Provider. PAINDEPO052021 Cigna Connect 1250 Enhanced Diabet es Care MIEP0874 MIEP0875 MIEP0877 3 Continuity of Care If your PCP or specialist ceases to be a Participat ing Physician, We will notify you. Under certain me dical circumstances, We may continue to reimburse Covered Expenses from your PCP or a specialist you've been seeing at the Participating Provider benefit l evel even though he or she is no longer affiliated with Cigna's network. If you are undergoing an active co urse of treatment for an acute or chronic condition and continued treatment is Medically Necessary, you may be eligible to receive continuing care from the No n- Participating Provider for a specified time, subjec t to the treating Provider's agreement. You may als o be eligible to receive continuing care if you are in y our second or third trimester of pregnancy. In this case, continued care may be extended through your deliver y and include a period of postpartum care. Such continuity of care must be approved in advance by Cigna, and your Physician must agree to accept Our reimbursement rate and to abide by Cigna's poli cies and procedures and quality assurance requirements. There may be additional circumstances where continued care by a Provider who ceases to be a Participating Provider will not be available, such as when the Provider loses his/her license to practice or retires. You may request continuity of care from Cigna after your Participating Provider's termination from Cig na's network; start by calling the toll-free number on y our ID card. Continuity of care must be Medically N ecessary and approved in advance by Us. Continuity of care w ill cease upon the earlier of: Successful transition of your care to a Participat ing Provider; or Completion of your treatment; or The next Annual Open Enrollment Period; or The length of time approved for continuity of care ends. Confined to a Hospital If you are confined in a Hospital on the Effective date of your coverage, you must notify Us of such a hospitalization within two (2) days, or as soon as reasonably possible thereafter. When you are enroll ed as an Insured Person, you agree to permit Cigna to ass ume direct coordination of your health care. We re serve the right to transfer you to the care of a Particip ating Provider and/or Participating Hospital if Cig na, in consultation with your attending Physician, determi nes that it is medically safe to do so. If you are hospitalized on the Effective Date of co verage and you fail to notify Us of this hospitaliz ation, refuse to permit Us to coordinate your care, or ref use to be transferred to the care of a Participatin g Provider or Participating Hospital, We will not be obligated to pay for any medical or Hospital expenses that are related to your hospitalization following the first two (2) days after your coverage begins.

No benefits are payable unless the Insured Person's coverage is in force at the time services are rend ered, and the payment of benefits is subject to all the t erms, conditions, limitations and exclusions of thi s Policy. In addition, no benefits are payable unless the Ins ured Person receives services from a Participating Provider, except as indicated below under \"Special Circumstan ces.\" Participating Hospitals, Participating Physicians a nd Other Participating Providers Covered Expenses for services provided by Participa ting Providers are based on Our Negotiated Rate.

Be sure to check with the Provider prior to an appo intment to verify that the Provider is currently contracted with Cigna. Special Circumstances This Policy does not cover Charges incurred for ser vices provided by Non-Participating Providers excep t in the limited situations described below. Your co st-sharing for Covered Expenses incurred for the se rvices of a Non-Participating Provider in these special ci rcumstances is indicated in the benefit schedule.

Recovery may be by settlem ent, judgment or otherwise. The lien will be in the amou nt of benefits paid by Us under this Policy for the treatment of the Illness, disease, Injury or condit ion for which the third party is liable. We will be entitled to collect on our lien even if the amount recovered by or for the Insured Person (or his or her estate, p arent or legal guardian) from or for the account of such thi rd party as compensation for the Injury, Illness or condition is less than the actual loss suffered by the Insure d Person.

Definitions For the purposes of this section, the following ter ms have the meanings set forth below: Plan Any of the following that provides benefits in the form of payment or services for: An insurance plan issued to an individual/nongroup or a group; or a self-insured group health plan providing benefits in the form of reimbursement or services for medical care or treatment/items. Governmental benefits as permitted by law, except for Medicaid, Medicare and Medicare supplement policies. Medical benefits coverage under any form of group or individual automobile insurance. Each plan or part of a plan which has the right to coordinate benefits will be considered a separate p lan. Primary Plan The plan that pays first as determined by the Order of Benefit Determination Rules below. Secondary Plan The plan that pays after the Primary Plan as determ ined by the Order of Benefit Determination Rules below. The benefits under the Secondary Plan are re duced based on the benefits under the Primary Plan. Allowable Expense The portion of a Covered Expense used in determinin g the benefits this plan pays when it is the Secondary Plan. The Allowable Expense is the lesser of: the charge used by the Primary Plan in determining the benefits it pays; the charge that would be used by this plan in dete rmining the benefits it would pay if it were the Pr imary Plan, and the amount of the Covered Expense. If the benefits for a Covered Expense under your Pr imary Plan are reduced because you did not comply with the Primary Plan's requirements (for example, getting pre-certification of Hospital admission or a second surgical opinion), the amount of the Allowab le Expense is reduced by the amount of the reduction. Claim Determination Period A Calendar Year, but does not include any part of a year during which you are not covered under this plan or any date before this section or any similar provision takes effect. PAINDEPO052021 Cigna Connect 1250 Enhanced Diabet es Care MIEP0874 MIEP0875 MIEP0877 82 Order of Benefit Determination Rules A plan that does not have a coordination of benefit s rule consistent with this section shall always be the Primary Plan. If the plan does have a coordinat ion of benefits rule consistent with this section, the first of the following rules that applies to the si tuation is the one that applies: The plan that covers you as an enrollee or an empl oyee shall be the Primary Plan and the plan that covers you as a dependent shall be the Secondary Pl an; If you are a dependent child whose parents are not divorced or legally separated, the Primary Plan sh all be the plan which covers the parent whose birthday falls first in the Calendar Year as an enrollee or employee; If you are the dependent of divorced or separated parents, benefits for the dependent shall be determined in the following order: o first, if a court decree states that one parent is responsible for the child's healthcare expenses or health coverage and the plan for that parent has actual kn owledge of the terms of the order, but only from the time of actual knowledge; o then, the plan of the parent with custody of the c hild; o then, the plan of the spouse of the parent with cu stody of the child; o then, the plan of the parent not having custody of the child; and o finally, the plan of the spouse of the parent not having custody of the child. The plan that covers you as an active employee (or as that employee's dependent) shall be the Primary Plan and the plan that covers you as a laid-off or retired employee (or as that employee's dependent) shall be the Secondary Plan. If the other plan does not have a similar provision and, as a result, the plans cannot agree on the order of benefit determin ation, this paragraph shall not apply. The plan that covers you under a right of continua tion which is provided by federal or state law shal l be the Secondary Plan and the plan that covers you as an active employee or retiree (or as that employee' s dependent) shall be the Primary Plan. If the other plan does not have a similar provision and, as a re sult, the plans cannot agree on the order of benefit dete rmination, this paragraph shall not apply. If one of the plans that covers you is issued out of the state whose laws govern this plan, and deter mines the order of benefits based upon the gender of a pa rent, and as a result, the plans do not agree on th e order of benefit determination, the plan with the g ender rules shall determine the order of benefits. If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the plan that has covered you for the lon ger period of time shall be primary. Effect on the Benefits Payable If this plan is the Primary Plan, the amount this plan pays for Covered Expenses will be determined without regard for the benefits payable under any o ther plan. If this plan is the Secondary Plan, the amount thi s plan pays for Covered Expenses is the Allowable Expense less the amount paid by the Primary Plan du ring a Claim Determination Period. If while covered under this plan, you are also cove red by another Cigna individual or group plan, you will be entitled to the benefits of only one plan. You may choose this plan or the plan under which yo u will be covered. Cigna will then refund any Premium received under the other plan covering the time period both policies were in effect. However, any c laim payments made by Cigna under the plan you elected to cancel will be deducted from any such re fund of Premium. PAINDEPO052021 Cigna Connect 1250 Enhanced Diabet es Care MIEP0874 MIEP0875 MIEP0877 83 Recovery of Excess Benefits If this plan is the Secondary Plan and Cigna pays f or Covered Expenses that should have been paid by the Primary Plan, or if Cigna pays any amount in excess of what it is obligated to pay, Cigna will have the right to recover the actual overpayment ma de. Cigna will have sole discretion to seek such recovery from any person to, or for whom, or with r espect to whom, such services were provided or such payments made by any insurance company, health care plan or other organization. If We request, you must execute and deliver to Us such instruments and documents as We determine are necessary to secure the right of recovery. Right to Receive and Release Information Cigna, without consent or notice to you, may obtain information from and release information to any other plan with respect to you in order to coordina te your benefits pursuant to this section. You must provide us with any information We request in order to coordinate your benefits pursuant to this secti on. This request may occur in connection with a submitt ed claim; if so, you will be advised that the \"othe r coverage\" information, (including an Explanation of Benefits paid under the Primary Plan) is required before the claim will be processed for payment. If no response is received within 55 days of the reque st, the claim will be denied. If the requested informat ion is subsequently received, the claim will be processed. Medicare Eligibles If an Insured Person is eligible for Medicare, Cign a will calculate the claim payment for Covered Services according to the benefit levels of this Po licy based on the allowed amount defined below, and pay this amount minus any amount paid by Medicare. Cigna will estimate the amount Medicare would have paid and reduce benefits by this amount for an y Insured Person who is eligible to enroll in Medicare but is not enrolled. In no event will the amount paid exceed the amount that Cigna would have paid if it were the sole insurance carrier. Under this scenario, the allowed amount will be the lesser of: The amount Medicare allowed; or Cigna's Negotiated Rate for a Participating Provid er; or Cigna's Allowed Expense for a Non-Participating Pr 1250 Enhanced Diabet es Care MIEP0874 MIEP0875 MIEP0877 84 WHEN YOU HAVE A COMPLAINT OR AN APPEAL For the purposes of this section, any reference to \"you\", \"your\" or \"Insured Person\" also refers to a representative or Provider designated by you to act on your behalf, unless otherwise noted.
