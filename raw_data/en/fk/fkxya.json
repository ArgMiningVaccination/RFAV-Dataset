Courses integrate anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology, cell biology, biochemistry, microbiology, and pharmacology relevant to the organ systems under study. Year 1: - Musculoskeletal System - dissection-based anatomy of the back and extremities; physiology and biochemistry of muscle contraction - Cancer biology - a review of important tenets of molecular/cellular biology, genetics, and immunology from the perspective of cancer pathogenesis and treatment. - Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Systems - normal function, common abnormalities, and structural anatomy of the heart, lungs, and vessels; components and physiology of blood. - Gastrointestinal, Endocrine, Renal, and Reproductive Systems - molecular, cellular, tissue, organ, and system-level integrations through concepts derived from basic anatomy, biochemistry, cell biology, genetics, histology, microbiology, physiology, and radiological imaging; gain experience and improve skills in diagnosis, reasoning, and communication - Neurological System - basic neurobiology and neuroanatomy, the motor and sensory systems, and basic aspects of higher cortical function, human development, and core principles of pharmacology. Year 2: - Infection and Immunity- immunology, microbiology, hematology, and gastrointestinal system; presents the core principles of pathology, microbiology, immunology, and pharmacology while providing an introduction to clinical medicine. - Cardiovascular, Pulmonary, and Renal Systems - core biomedical and clinical principles of pulmonology, cardiology, nephrology, organ transplantation, and multi-organ disease processes. Each topic includes an integrated approach that blends pathology and pathophysiology, pharmacology, immunology, microbiology, and clinical medicine. - Neurology, Endocrinology, Reproductive Health, Rheumatology, and Dermatology core biomedical and clinical principles of the central and peripheral nervous systems, psychiatry, endocrinology, men's and women's health, skin/bones, and selected topics encountered in the ambulatory care setting. Doctoring I and II The first two years are delivered in a small group-based sequence that teaches students interviewing, physical diagnosis, and differential diagnostic skills; bioethics, medical humanities, health systems and economics; community, preventive, and public health. Introduces care of special populations including the disabled. Evidence-based Clinical Reasoning I and II A two-year sequence first introduces students to principles of statistics and evidence-based medicine, then applies that knowledge in small group-based problem-based learning (PBL) cases in which students research topics relevant to the presented cases and teach their small group peers what they learned. The course emphasizes evidence-based and lifelong learning principles. Curriculum Unique to the SELECT MD program SELECT ProloguesMultiday immersion experiences in leadership development and SELECT competencies (Leadership, Values-centered patient care, and Health Systems) as a prelude to the next academic year. SELECT I-IVReinforcement of the SELECT competencies in seminars, small groups, case studies, and individual coaching sessions in groups, peer coaching, and 1-on-1 with faculty to build leadership skills. SELECT Summer ImmersionA summer internship between years 1 and 2 in a leadership venue of the student's choice (e.g. government, industry, academia). Year 3 SELECT Clinical Clerkships These clerkships at Lehigh Valley Health Network, PA, include the development of leadership competencies in the clinical setting. There is a higher amount of outpatient experience than in the Tampa Clerkships. - Primary Care - a longitudinal year-long clerkship held throughout the year with continuity clinics in outpatient offices and clinics, including experience in Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, and Pediatrics emphasizing management of common chronic diseases and prevention strategies. - Adult Medicine - (12 weeks) focused on inpatient care of acute adult illness - Surgical Care - (12 weeks) principles of pre-, intra-, and post-operative care, with rotations in general, trauma, vascular, and gynecologic surgery. Includes selective rotations in surgical sub-specialties and simulation training at the Lehigh Valley Surgical Education Center in Allentown, PA. - Psychiatry - (6 weeks) runs concurrently with the Neurology; focused on diagnosis and therapy of psychiatric illness in the inpatient and outpatient settings, and to become comfortable interacting with patients with psychiatric illnesses, proficient in obtaining a psychiatric history, and performing a mental status. - Neurology - (6 weeks) runs concurrently with the Psychiatry; focused on diagnosis and therapy of neurologic illness in the inpatient and outpatient setting, and to become comfortable interacting with patients with neurological illnesses, proficient in obtaining a history and performing a basic neurological examination. - Women's Health - (6 weeks) runs concurrently with the Pediatric Medicine; focused on general gynecology, obstetrics, labor, and delivery. Students work on the labor floor to better understand antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum care. On outpatient women's health, students will have exposure to prenatal care, well-woman preventative care, and evaluation of common gynecologic problems. - Pediatric Medicine - (6 weeks) runs concurrently with Women's Health; is focused on general newborn nursery and inpatient pediatric care. Students take care of pediatric patients who are admitted to the hospital with acute problems and spend time in the newborn nursery. They will also evaluate children in the outpatient setting for acute-care visits. Year 4 Specialty Track Sub-Phase: SELECT Electives/Selective OverviewAs in the Core program, year 4 is focused on preparation for residency, building advanced clinical skills and SELECT competencies, and exploration of areas of medicine of interest to the student. Nine months of coursework are required, including the tracks described in the core curriculum, but also including: Year 4 is focused on preparation for residency, building advanced clinical skills, and exploration of areas of medicine of interest to the student. Nine months of coursework are required, including: 1. Three to five months of work in a track that prepares students for a specific residency discipline, including: a. An Acting Internship with direct patient management responsibility (4 weeks) b. Specialty track electives: two 4-week selectives to prepare for a specialty of choice (8 weeks) c. Unstable Patient courses: choose a 4-week course based in the intensive care units or emergency dept. (4 weeks) d. Entrustable Professional Activity (EPA) course: choose a course to solidify skills in the specialty-specific EPAs (2 weeks) e. General Elective: choose a general elective, or complete an independent study or extramural elective (4 weeks) 2. Longitudinal Doctoring IV course (6 weeks*) with training in leadership, how to be a teacher as a resident physician, pain management, management of substance use disorder, patient safety, life support, disaster management, financial wellness, and other key skills needed for the intern year of residency. *Shorter than the Core MD program.
