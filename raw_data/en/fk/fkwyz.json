The universal argument between modern medicine and traditional medicines exist in the market since long back, however therapeutic knowledge of Indian traditional medicine has propelled various traditional approaches with various theories and methodologies, whi ch are of regional significance (1). According to modern Ayurvedic sources, the origins of Ayurveda have been traced to around 6,000 BCE . The first recorded forms of Ayurveda as medical texts evolved from the Vedas. Ayurveda is a discipline of the upaveda or \"auxiliary knowledge\" in Vedic tra dition. The origin s of Ayurveda are also found in Atharvaveda described as magical cures for disease . There are three principal early texts on Ayurveda. 1. The Charaka Samhita, 2. The Sushruta Samhita and 3. the Bhela Samhita. Illnesses portrayed Following are illness portrayed and recovered by means of Ayurved ic traditional medicines. Fever, cough, consumption, diarrhea, dropsy , abscesses, seizures, tumours, and leprosy and that ded plastic surgery , lithotomy , tonsillectomy , couching turing to release fl uids in the abdomen , extraction of foreign bodies, treatment of anal fistulas , treating fractures, amputations , cesarean sections , and stitching of wound. The use of herbs and surgical instrumen ts became widespread. During this period, treatments were also prescribed for complex ailments, including angina pectoris , diabetes , hypertension , and stones (2). Further development and spread Ayurveda flourished thr oughout the Indian Middle Ages. Dalhana (fl. 1200), Sarngadhara ABSTRACT The word \" Ayurveda\" meaning knowledge of life and longevity. Rather than frequent usage of Medicines in common disorders, Ayurvdic medicines are as good as food which serve role of the nutritional needs. Because of the changing in life style and carelessness towards sickness with respect to time as well as money, p eople are growing modernization som e traditional ways. Now a days, There has been increased global interest in traditional medicine. In this dissertation, attempted to brief history along with worldwide concepts of Ayurveda and availability of Ayurvedic m edicines which play roles in medical emergency, surgical emergency and trad itional one as nutrition supple ment. Moreover, WHO contribution in global acceptance of Ayurveda reflected in this paper reveals worldwide usage of Ayurveda medicines. Opportunity and challenges with global perspective of Ayurvedic medicine and gold time for modernization presented in this concept paper gives idea about market value for herbal medicines. Keywords: Ayurveda, WHO, Neutraceuticals, BCE, TRM . Snehal International Journal ISSN: 2455 - 9946 \u00a9 (fl. 1300) and Bhavamisra (fl. 1500) compiled works on Indian medicine. The medical works of both Sushruta and Charaka were also translated into the Chinese langu age in the 5th century and during the 8th century, they were translated into the Arabic and Persian language. Th e 9th -century Persian physician Muhammad ibn Zakariya al -Razi was familiar with the text. The Arabic works derived from the Ayurvedic texts even tually also reached Europe by the 12th century. In Renaissance Italy, the Branca family of Sicily and Gaspare Tagliacozzi ( Bologna ) were influenced by the Arabic reception of the Sushruta's surgical techniques. British physicia ns traveled to India to observe rhinoplasty being performed using native methods, and reports on Indian rhinoplasty were published in the Gentleman's Magazine in 1794. Instruments described in the Sushruta Samhita were further modified in Europe. Joseph Constantine Carpue studied plastic surgery methods in India for 20 years and, in 1815, was able to perform the first major rhinoplasty surgery in the western world, using the \"Indian\" method of nose reconst ruction. In 1840 Brett published an article about this technique. During the period of colonial British rule of India, the practice of Ayurveda was neglected by the British Indian Government, in favor of modern medicine. After Indian independence, there wa s more focus on Ayurveda and other traditional medical systems. Ayurveda became a part of the Indian National health care system, with state hospitals for Ayurveda established across the country (3) . Worldwide Concepts and thoughts for Ayurveda. Worldwide Concepts Ayurveda is a system of medicine with historical roots in the Indian subcontinent Globalized and modernized practices derived from Ay urveda traditions are a type of medicine. Ayurveda developed significantly during the Vedic period and later some of the non-Vedic systems such as Buddhism and Jainism also developed medical concepts an d practices that appear in the classical Ayurveda texts. Ayurveda tre atises describe three elemental doas viz. vta, pitta (Skt. smyatva ) doas results in health, while inequality ( viamatva ) results in disease. Ayurveda treatises divide medicine into eight canonical components. Eight Components: The earliest classical Sanskrit works on Ayurveda describe medicine as bein g divided into eight components. This characterization of the physicians ' art, \"the medicine t hat has eight components\" (Skt. cikitsymagy ), is first found in the Sanskrit epic the Mahbhrata , ca 4th century BCE. The components are: Kyacikits : general medicine, medicine of the body. Kaumra -bhtya : the treatment of children, paediatrics alyatantra : surgical techniques and the extraction of foreign objects lkyatantra: treatment of ailments affecting ears, eyes, nose, mouth, etc. (\"ENT\") Bhtavidy : pacification of possessing spirits, and the people whose minds are affected by such possession Agadatantra : toxicology Rasyanatantra : rejuvenation and tonics for increasing lifespa n, intellect and strength Vjkaraatantra : aphrodisiacs and treatments for increasing the volume and viability of semen and sexual pleasure. Composition, Principle and Terminology Snehal International Journal of Innovativ e Science and Technology ISSN: 2455 - 9946 \u00a9 201 9 IJIST Publishing Group 2019; 4(1) Page 15 Figure 1. The three dohas and the five elements from which they are comp osed. Table 1 Composition for Ayurvedic medicine consist of following components Tissues Bodily Substances Ayurveda has historically divided bodily substances into five classical elements : (Sanskrit) panchamahabhuta inherent gunas (qualities or characteristics) three elemental bodily ), Kapha) These are organized in Ama (a Sanskrit word mea ning \"uncooked\" or \"undigested\" ) is used to refer to the concept of anything that exists in a state of incomplete transformation. With regards to oral hygiene , it is claimed to be a toxic byproduct generated by improper or incomplete digestion . The concept has no equivalent in standard medicine . Principle: How they work Three elem doshas (called Vata, Pitta and Kapha), and states that a balance of the doshas results in health, while imbalance results in disease. One Ayurvedic view is that the doshas are balanced when they are equal to each other, while anothe r view is that each human possesses a unique combination of the doshas which define this person's temperament and characteristics. In either case, it says that each person should modulate their behavior or environment to increase or decrease the doshas and maintain their natural state. How to practice Ayurvedic doctors regard physical existence, mental existence, and personality as a unit, with each element being able to influence the others. This is a holistic approach used during diagnosis and therapy, and is a fundamental aspect of Ayurveda. Another part of Ayurvedic treatment says that there are channels ( srotas ) Snehal International Journal of ISSN: 2455 - 9946 \u00a9 201 9 IJIST Publishing Group 2019; 4(1) Page 16 which trans port fluids, and that the channels can be opened up by massage treatment using oils and Swedana (fomentation). Unhealthy, or blocked, channels are thought to cause disease. Diagno sis approa ch Ayurveda has eight ways to diagnose illness by means of five senses, called Nadi (pulse), Mootra (urine), Mala (stool), Jihva (tongue), Shabda (speech), Sparsha (touch), Druk (vision), and Aakruti (appearance) Treatment and prevention Ayurveda focuses on exercise, yoga , and meditation . One type of prescription is a Sattvic diet . Ayurveda follows the concept of Dinacharya , which says that natural cycles (waking, sleeping, working, meditation etc.) are important for health. Hygiene, including regular bathing, cleaning of teeth, tongue scraping , skin care, and eye wash ing, is also a central practice. Substances used Plant -based treatments in Ayurveda may be derived from roots, leaves, fruits, bark, or seeds such as cardamom and cinnamon . Animal products used in Ayurveda include milk, bones, and gallstones . In addition, fats are prescribed both for consumption and for external use. Con sumption of minerals, including sulphur , arsenic , lead, copper sulfate and gold, are also prescribed. The addition of minera ls to herbal medicine is called rasa shastra . Ayurveda uses alcoholic beverages called Madya , which are said to adjust the doshas by increasing Pitta and reducing Vatta and Kapha Madya are classified by the raw material and fermentation process, and the categories include: sugar -based, fruit -based, cereal -based, cereal -based with herbs, fermentated with vinegar, and tonic wines. Purified opium is used in eight Ayurvedic preparations an d is said to balance the Vata and Kapha doshas and increase the Pitta dosha. Research In India, research in Ayurveda is undertaken by the Ministry of AYUSH , an abbreviat ion for the Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy, through a national network of research institutes. In Nepal, the National Ayurvedic Training and Research Centre (NATRC) researches medicinal herbs in the country. In Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine looks after the research in Ayurveda through various national research institutes.

Difficult labour Medico -legal Emergencies As suggested, it is advisable not to treat the cases where medicolegal complications may arise, unless authorized, still a physician may have to attend such cases. In this condition, a physician sho uld be careful to inform proper authorities and should be careful in history - taking and examination of the patient because he may have to be present before the court of law for evidence, such emergencies are : - (1) Agni - dagdha Burns and seals (2) V isha - peeta Poisoning (3) Sarpa - Damsha Snake bits (4) Vrisehika Damsha Scorpion Bite Some experience by practice reveals that Ayurveda can also be useful in emergency conditions and life threatening conditions. Some examples are cited below to justify that ayurveda can also be useful in emergency conditions. Case No. 1: Pralapaka - sannipat jwara: A patient suffering from Typhoid suffered from semi consciousness and also muttering delirium. My diagnosis was Pralapaka Jwara'.The following quath was given repeatedly every 3 hrs. & his delirium subsided. (1) Tagar (7) names from Dravyaguna by Yadavji T. Acharya. The result of this quath was very good; the delirium subsided; the patient had a Snehal International Journal of Innovativ e Science and Technology ISSN: 2455 - 9946 \u00a9 201 9 IJIST Publishing Group 2019; 4(1) Page 18 sound sleep and the fever also came down to normal within 2 to 3 days. Case No.2: Dehydration Immediat ely treatment was started. The treatment was - (1) Karpoor Rasa - 1 Pill 3 times a day (2) Lemon juice + Honey + Water - Just like syrup was given for drinking. At a time not more than \u00bc glass i.e. about 1 to 1\u00bd of water should be taken. Shankh bhasma 250 mg to be taken 3 to 4 times with lemon syrup. Within 1 day the frequency of stool was controlled. Gradually the stool was formed and vomiting subsided. His diarrhea was controlled with 4 to 5 days. Many more examples can be cited. The ancient physicians we re treating such cases. But since last few years , this question has been raised (5). Traditional medicines (6) India is known for its traditional medicinal systems \u2014Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani.. Food is the major source for serving the nutritional needs, bu t with growing modernization some traditional methods are being given up (Table 1). Hence, the modern food habits are affecting the balanced nutrition (7). Table 3 Impact of modern food concept in required nutrition. Nutrients Intake by traditional ways Intake by modern ways Effect on nutrient intake Water soluble vitamins (vitamins B and C) and minerals Vegetables used for cooking were/are fresh Freezing and packaging of the cut vegetables Loss of ascorbic acid, water soluble vitamins, and minerals Proteins, minerals, and vitamin B complex Manual processing of cereals, without polishing Milling and polishing of cereals Reduces protein, minerals, and vitamin B complex Calcium, iron, thiamine, and niacin Fresh grinding at home Heavy milling and poor storage conditions Loss of calcium, iron, thiamin, and niacin Iron Cooking in iron pot Food generally cooked in cookware like nonstick and Teflon -coated utensils The benefit of organic iron from the conventional iron pot is not obtained by using modern cookware Copper Storing of water and cooking use of copper vessels Stainless steel utensils and plastic wares Copper required in minor amount which is not gained from modern utensils used today. Deficiency is known to cause chronic diarrhea, malabsorption problems, and reduce immunity. Use of plastic containers is also harmful Medicinal Plants Used in Alternative/ Traditional Medicines India is the leading producer of medicinal plants. In India, around 20,000 medicinal plants have been recorded; however, traditional practitioners use only 7,000 -7,500 plants for curing different diseases. The proportion of use of plants in the different Snehal International Journal of Innovativ e Science and Technology ISSN: 2455 - 9946 \u00a9 201 9 IJIST Publishing Group 2019; 4(1) Page 19 Indian systems of medicine is Ayurveda 2000, Siddha 1300, Unani 1000, Homeopathy 800, Tibetan 500, Modern 200, and folk 4500. In India, around 25,000 effective plant -based formulations are used in traditional and f olk medicine. More than 1.5 million practitioners are using the traditional medicinal system for health care in India. It is estimated that more than 7800 manufacturing units are involved in the production of natural health products and traditional plant -based formulations in India, which requires more than 2000 tons of medicinal plant raw material annually . More than 1500 herbals are sold as dietary supplements or ethnic traditional medicines. Some common medicinal plants having nutraceutical potential an d their primary use in traditional medicine [ 6-26] are being given in Table 2(8).

Expanding Complementary and Alternative (CAM) Approaches Among wealthier populations in both developed and developing countries, complementary and alternative practices are popular although proof of their safety and effectiveness is modest. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine has been inaugurated as the United States Federal Government's lead agency for scientific research in this arena of medicine. Its mission is to explore complementary and alternative healing practices in the context of rigorous science, support sophisticated researc h, train researchers, disseminate information to the public on the modalities that work, and explain the scientific rationale underlying discoveries. The center is committed to explore and fund all such therapies for which there is sufficient preliminary d ata, compelling public health need and ethical justifications. Nowadays people seek CAM techniques because they believe the side effects will be lower. In both developed and developing countries, users of complementary methods also commonly seek convention al care . Table 3 enlists some important Ayurvedic herbal formulations (9).

Nutraceuticals, a n emerging concept, can be broadly categorized as products which are extracted from natural sources (nature -like) or manufactured synthetically (man -made), which supplement the diet to provide nutrition over and above regular food and help prevent nutritio n-related disorders. Nutraceuticals, foods or food components that help in prevention or treatment of disease, are made from herbal/botanical raw materials. The nutraceutical industry is rapidly growing (7%-12% per year). With extensive anecdotal data on exciting health results, nutraceuticals promise significant contributions to disease prevention. The global nutraceuticals market is estimated at 117 billion US dollar of which India's share is a meager 0.9%. United States and Japan are key markets for nut raceutical consumption. Indian nutraceuticals market is about 1 billion USD which is increasing day by day. Globally, this market is expected to reach 177 billion USD in 2013. The dietary supplements category is expected to be the fastest growing product c ategory globally (10). Herbal Medicines in Dietary Supplements Dietary supplements and herbal remedies are popular complementary or alternative products Snehal International Journal of Innovativ e Science and Technology ISSN: 2455 - 9946 \u00a9 201 9 IJIST Publishing Group 2019; 4(1) Page 28 for people. These are the supplements that are intended to supplement the diet and contain one or more dietary ingredients (including vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, and other substances) or their constituents. These botanicals are sold in many forms as fresh or dried products, liquid or solid extracts, tablets, capsules, powder s, tea bags, and so forth. For example, fresh ginger root is often used in various food stores; dried ginger root is sold packaged in tea bags, capsules, or tablets, and liquid preparations made from ginger root are also sold in the market. A particular gr oup of chemicals or a single chemical may be isolated from a botanical and sold as a dietary supplement, usually in tablet or capsule form. An example is phytoestrogens from soy products (11) Nutraceutical Concept with Varying Definition In Canada, this term is natural health products; in USA, it is called dietary supplements, and in Japan it is called foods for special health use. There are distinct definitions and regulations for dietary supplements and functional foods in USA, Canada, a nd Europe. Traditional and herbal medicines are included in the definition of dietary or nutritional supplements in Canada. Japan does not mention traditional herbal medicines under functional foods for special health use. USA includes herbal and botanical in its definition. The Indian definition lists down the ingredients that a product should have, and it also specifies general properties of nutraceutical. There are three categories which have been considered under the nutraceuticals. Functional Foods. Foods that have specific physiological benefits and/or reduce the risk of chronic disease, that is, nutrition fortified foods like fortified flour, fortified oil, fortified malt-based powder and probiotic foods like yogurt. Dietary Supplements. Supplements provide nutrients that are missing or are not consumed in sufficient quantity in a person's diet, that is, vitamin supplements, mineral supplements, macronutrients, antioxidants, tonics, herbal formulations like Chyawanprash, Musli pak, Ashwagandhadi leh, and nonherbal products like cod liver oil. Functional Beverages . Liquids that quench thirst along with replenishing minerals provide energy, prevent ailments, and promote healthy life style, that is, sports and energy drinks, fortified juices, and glucose drinks and powder. Nutraceutical products aim to fulfill specific needs of the persons based on which they may be classified as follows. Enhancement segments : high protein supplements, energy drinks, sports drinks, glucose drinks, and so forth. Specific condition segments : antioxidants, vitamin supplements, and mineral supplements. Foundation segments : macronutrient supplements, nutrition fortified foods (fortified flour, soups, biscuits, etc.), probiotic foods (yogurt), and herbal formulations (chyawanp rash, Ashwagandhadi leh) (12). Contribution of world health organization in the global acceptance of Ayurveda Department of AYUSH, Central Council of Research in Ayurveda and Siddha and numerous other collaborative centers of WHO in India are assigned with several Appraisal Project Work (APW) and Direct Financial Cooperation (DFC) projects that will strengthen Ayurveda as evidence -based medicine for its global acceptance. World Health Organization (WHO) realized at Alma Ata in 1978 the role of traditional, alternative and complementary systems of medicine in the healthcare sectors of both developing and the developed nations with the slogan of Health for All. Strengthening of Traditional Medicine by World Health Organization WHO is directing and coordinating with health authorities in respective countries around the globe and is responsible for providing leadership on global health matters, shaping the health research agenda, setting norms and standards, articulating evidence -based policy options, providing technical support to Snehal International Journal of Innovativ e Science and Technology ISSN: 2455 - 9946 \u00a9 201 9 IJIST Publishing Group 2019; 4(1) Page 29 countries and monitoring and assessing health trends, and these responsibilities of WHO hold good for TRM too. Specific Strategies Considering all these issues, WHO is mainstreaming TRM in health system with definite strategies that cover each and every potential of TRM. [ Table 1 ] Certain contributory steps of WHO are mentioned below. Table 6 Specific strategies of WHO for promotion of TRM Criteria for classification of herbal medicines As per the WHO guidelines, for all practical purposes, herbal medicines can be classified into four categories, based on their origin, evolution and the forms of current usage. Category 1: Indigenous herbal medicines This category of herbal medicines is historically used in the folklore of a local community or region and is very well known through ages by the local populatio n in terms of its composition, treatment and dosage. Category 2: Herbal medicines in systems Medicines in this category have been used for a long time and are well documented with their special theories and concepts, and are duly accepted by the respectiv e countries. For example, Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha fall into this category of TRM. Category 3: Modified herbal medicines These are herbal medicines as described above in categories 1 and 2, except that they have been modified in some way or the other wit h respect to their shape, dosage form, mode of administration, ingredients, and methods of preparation or medical indications. They have to meet the national regulatory requirements of safety and efficacy of herbal medicines. Category 4: Imported products with a herbal medicine base This category covers all imported herbal medicines including raw materials and products. Imported herbal medicines must be registered and marketed in the countries of origin. The safety and efficacy data have to be submitted to the national authority of the importing country and also need to meet the requirements of safety and efficacy of herbal medicines in the recipient country. Fellowship at collaborative centers Demand for herbal products worldwide has increased at an annual rate of 8% during the period of 1994 -2001, and according to WHO forecast, the global herbal market would be worth $5 trillion by the year 2050. As of today, Europe and the United States are two major herbal product markets in the world, with a market share of 41% and 20%, respectively. It seems that Ayurveda is undergoing a phase of resurgence and revival in the world similar to the one at home. WHO, India and Ayurveda - A Reasonable Advancement Recently, in August 2010, Department of AYUSH of the Government of India has modified Rule 158 of The Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 to facilitate licensing and export of Ayurvedic herbal medicines under categories of Ayurvedic cosmeceuticals, Ayurvedic nutraceuticals and Ayurvedic extracts. Snehal Science and Technology ISSN: 2455 - 9946 \u00a9 201 9 IJIST Publishing Group 4(1) Page 30 For standard pr oduction of Ayurvedic medicines, WHO sponsored many Direct Financial Cooperative (DFC) projects in 2001 at Pharmacopeial Laboratory of Indian Medicine, projects on safety profile of Ayurvedic medicines in 2007 at Banaras Hindu University and WHO sponsored program for the planning of pharmacovigilance program in 2008 at Gujarat Ayurveda University. More recently, in 2010 and 2011, under DFC program, WHO had sponsored four capacity building training programs for coordinators of regional and peripheral centers of pharmacovigilance of Ayurvedic system of medicine. Further, Ayurvedic Clinical Trial project might be a sustainable program for evidence -based data generation of Ayurvedic classical medicines for certain diseases, whereas data available on Ayush Resear ch Portal and in other research papers ensures safety of Ayurvedic medicines. In all these programs of Department of AYUSH, WHO is cooperating as an academic associate and also providing some logistic support (13). Opportunities and Challenges in Ayurveda : Global Perspective Modern medicine has failed miserably in developing robust preventive medicine. India has over 500 teaching Hospitals, 700,000 Vaidyas and thousands of dispensaries. Ministry for AYUSH is trying to get World Health Organization (WHO) r ecognition for these facilities. Every year 30,000 Vaidyas are added to this pool. Global market size for herbal products exceeds 5000 billion, whereas Indian share of this market is just under 0.9% According to the experts the infrastructure at these AYUS H facilities are poor. In May of 2015, Ayurveda got a nod from the Swiss Government. Practitioners of Indian Traditional Medicine, Ayurveda will soon be able to get a federally approved diploma after passing an examination. The authorities in Switzerland h ope that this will be bring credibility, especially in the eyes of the insurance providers. The first exams are to be held in November and applicants have to first pass a series of six pre -exams. Although these examinations are open to foreign nationals, i t will be offered only in German, French and Italian (14). Traditional Medicine: The Goldmine for Modern Drugs In traditional systems, plant and plant products are used for the cure of diseases; however, in modern science the bioactive compounds of the pla nts are identified. These plants materials are being used for the development of modern drugs . It is believed that most of the drugs either traditionally used or used in modern science derived from natural sources. For the treatment of cancer, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several drugs derived from natural sources. Of the 121 prescription drugs in use today for cancer treatment, 90 are derived from p lants. At least 877 small -molecule drugs introduced worldwide between 1981 and 2002, most (61%) can be traced back to their origins in natural products. These include Vincristine and and others . Moreover, there are numerous other natural compounds have shown chemopreventive and therapeutic efficacy and are in preclinical and clinic al stage. One of the most widely studied molecules is curcumin, a component of turmeric. Turmeric is being used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis , chronic anterior uveitis, conjunctivitis, skin cancer, small pox, chicken pox, wound healing, urinary tract infections, and liver ailments. It is also being used against digestive disorders, jaundice, menstrual difficulties, and colic; for abdominal pain and distension; and for dyspeptic conditions including loss of appetite, postprandial feelings of fullness, and liver and gallbladder complaints. Many South Asian countries use it as an antiseptic for cuts, burns, and bruises, and as an anti bacterial agent .Epidemiological and experimental studies suggested that curcumin is a pleiotropic molecule and can acts against wide varieties of diseases .Because of its safety and efficacy, the FDA has declared turmeric and its active component Snehal International Journal of Innovativ e Science and Technology ISSN: 2455 - 9946 \u00a9 9 IJIST Publishing Group 2019; 4(1) Page 31 curcumin as GRAS (generally regarded as safe). Other traditionally used natural compound is guggulsterone derived from the gum resin (guggulu) of the tree Commiphora mukul. The resin has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries to treat a variety of ailments, including obesity, bone fractures, arthritis, inflammation, cardiovascular disease and lipid disorders. Recent studies have shown that guggulsterone is an antagonist for the bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor and regulating cholesterol homeostasis. I t exhibits efficacy against inflammatory diseases by modulating various signaling molecules There are other plant products have been used as a traditional medicine. Grape extracts have been used for human health over 2000 years ago in Darakchasava,' a wel l-known India n herbal preparation whose main ingredient is Vitis vinifera L. This Ayurvedic' medicine is prescribed as a cardiotonic and also is given for other disorders. Latter chemical analysis showed that it has an active component resveratrol, which has numerous activities against several diseases. It exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties. Another compound, flavopi ridol, which is a semisynthetic flavonoid closely related to a compound originally isolated from the stem bark of Dysoxylum binectariferum. This plant indig enous to India and described in Ayurveda . Modern findings showed that flavopiridol is a potent inhibitor of cyclin -dependent kinases and acts against cancer and other chronic diseases. In Ayurveda, withan olide, which are extracted from Withania somnifera , are employ ed in the treatment of arthritis and menstrual disorders. This compound now investigated as potent inhibitors of angiogenesis, inflammation, tumor development, metastasis and oxidative stress, and a promoter of cardio protection. The medicinal plant W. somn ifera is widely known for its anti -inflammatory, cardioactive and neuroprotective effects. Boswellic acid, an active component of Boswellia serrata (also known as Salai guggul), is used in Indian traditional Ayurvedic medicine to treat rheumatic diseases, respiratory diseases and liver disorders. Extensive studies since last 30 years showed that the traditional therapeutic usefulness of Boswellic acid is a result of its anti-inflammatory activity, possibly mediated through the inhibition of 5-lipooxygenase and leukocyte elastase. Besides these different formulations and extracts of fruits vegetables, spices, cereal, legumes and other parts of plants including leaf, root and bark are being used against various ailments in different traditional medicines aroun d the world. In Chinese traditional medicines alone over three hundred herbs are commonly being used. Some of the most commonly used herbs are ginseng, wolfberry, dong quai, salvia. Similarly, in Korean, Unani and Native American traditional medicine systems hundreds of other plants are being used. Modern sciences are investigating the active components and mechanisms of action of these plant products and are in preclinical and clinical stage. Along with their efficacy, recent findings suggest that these herbal components are safe and cost effective. Because of their pharmacological safety, these agents can be used alone or as adjun cts to current chemotherapeutic agents to enhance therapeutic effects and minimize chemotherapy -induced toxicity. Since more than 80% of the world's population cannot afford modern medicines, the use of these herbal drugs either raw or in pure form (modern medicine) is appreciated. Thus the use of these drugs provided by Mother Nature could increase the life span by decreasing the cost and toxicity of modern drugs . (15-16). Conclusion Renewed public interest in complementary and alternative medicines come in to enforcement due to increased side effects, lack of curative treatment for several chronic diseases, high cost of new drugs, microbial resistance . Now a days numerous nutraceutical combinations have entered the international market through exploration of ethno - pharmacological claims made by different traditional practices. In the current scenario, herbal drugs and their formul ations have become an alternative to the Snehal International Journal of Innovativ e Science and Technology ISSN: 2455 - 9946 \u00a9 201 9 IJIST Publishing Group 2019; 4(1) Page 32 synthetic drugs. The plant -derived natural products are the products of secondary metabolism; the compounds which are not essential for existence in laboratory conditions, but are certainly responsible for self -defense coordination in natural conditions. Ninety percent of the daily diet should be made up of nutrient rich plant foods, whose calories are accompanied by health -promoting phytochemicals, vegetables, fresh fruits, beans and legumes, raw nuts, seeds, and av ocados, starchy vegetables, and whole grains. These foods or nutraceuticals construct a health - promoting, disease -preventing diet with protective substances. The rich nutrient food intake will provide maximum protection against not only infections, asthma, and allergies but also against heart disease and cancer in adulthood. This new upsurge of interest in Ayurveda and its rapidly increasing public utilization has given rise to many newer issues and challenges.
