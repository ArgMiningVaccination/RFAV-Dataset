What Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 is and what it is used for Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 is a vaccine used to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS - CoV -2. It is given as a booster injection to individuals aged 6 years and older. The active substance in the vaccine is ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) encoding the SARS -CoV -2 Spike protein. The RNA lipid nanoparticles. Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 is only for individuals who have previously received at least a primary vaccination course against COVID -19. Spikevax bival ent Original/Omicron BA.1 contains Spike the original strain of the virus whereas imelasomeran encodes the Spike protein of the Omicron BA.1 variant of the virus. The original Spikevax vaccine contains elasomeran only. As Spikevax bivalent Original/Omic ron BA.1 does not contain the virus, it cannot give you COVID -19. How the vaccine works Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 stimulates the body's natural defences (immune system). The vaccine works by causing the body to produce protection (antibodies) against the virus that causes COVID -19. The vaccine contains mRNA . This carries instructions that cells in the body can use to make the spike protein that is also on the virus. The cells then make antibodies against the spike protein to help fight off the virus. This will help to protect you against COVID -19. 2. What you need to know before you are given Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 2 The vaccine must not be given if - you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6). Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 if: - you have previously had a severe, life -threatening allergic reaction after any other vaccine injection or after you were given Spikevax (original) or Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 in the past. - you have a very weak or compromised immune system - you have ever fainted following any needle injection. - you have a bleeding disorder - you have a high fever or severe infection; however, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold - you have any serious illness - if you have anxiety related to injections Myocarditis/pericarditis There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart ) after vaccination with Spikevax (original ) (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second dose compared to the first dose of Spikevax (original) , and more often in younger males. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur . If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Spikevax . Capillary few cases of capillary leak syndrome flare -ups (causing fluid leakage from small blood vessels (capilla ries) resulting in rapid swelling of the arms and legs, sudden weight gain and feeling faint, low blood pressure ) have been reported following vaccination with Spikevax (original) . If you have previously had episodes of CLS, talk to a doctor before you are given Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 . Duration of vaccine, Spikevax bivalent Or iginal/Omicron BA.1 may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected. Children Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 is not recommended for children aged under 6 years . Other medicines and Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. Spikevax bivalent Or iginal/Omicron BA.1 may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how Spikevax bivalent Or iginal/Omicron BA.1 works. Spikevax bivalent Or iginal/Omicron BA.1 may be lower in people who are immunocompromised . In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID -19. In addition, your close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your doctor. 3 Pregna ncy and breast -feeding Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 can be given during pregnancy and breastfeeding. A large amount of information from pregnant women vaccinated with Spikevax (original) during the second and third trimester ha ve not shown negative effects on the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Since differences betw een Spikevax (original) and Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 are only related to the spike protein in the vaccine , and the side effect profiles are similar , Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 can be given during pregnancy. No effects on the br eastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. A large amount of information from women who were breastfeeding after vaccinat ion with Spikevax (original) have not shown a risk for side effects in breastfed newborns/infants . Since differences between Spikevax (original) and Original/Omicron BA.1 are only related to the spike protein in the vaccine, and the side effect profiles are similar, Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 can be given during breastfeed ing. If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant , and have any questions or concerns , tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you receive this vaccine. Driving and using machines Do not drive or use machines if you are feeling unwell after vaccination. Wait until any effects of the vaccine have worn off before you drive or use machines.
