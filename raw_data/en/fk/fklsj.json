The gentle Buddhist approach to life shines through in this amazingly powerful branch of ancient medicine. In this unit, you will study the basic principles of Tibetan medicine and relate these to Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine. The unit includes the history and philosophy of Tibetan medicine (the Mind and the Three Mental Poisons, the Five Elements, the Three Humours (Wind, Bile and Phlegm), the Fifteen Humour Sub Divisions, Humours and constitutional characteristics, the Seven Bodily Constituents, Vital Essence (Dhang), the Three Excretory Functions, the organs, disease process according to Tibetan medicine (digestion including wind, bile and phlegm, Humour Imbalance in the Seven Bodily Constituents, Four stages of Disease, Hot and cold diseases, the 404 diseases of Tibetan medicine, diagnosis, dietary therapeutics, medicines and the medicine trees. Tibetan medicine is a blend of Ayurvedic, Chinese and Greek medicine which you will clearly see as you work your way through this section. Tibetan medicine is based on the Gyud-Shi which translates as 'The Four Tantras' (Tantra = text). The Gyud-Shi contains the medical teachings that Buddha gave in Varanasi, India when he was 71 years old (c 870 BC). In the 8th century the Gyud-Shi was translated into Tibetan. Part B: Unani Medicine Unani Medicine developed out of ancient Greek medicine (Unani=Greek; Tibb=medicine in Arabic). In this unit you will learn about the similarities between other medical disciplines and Greek medicine. There are many similarities to Ayurvedic principles which surely had an influence upon Greek medicine and vice-versa. It is likely that the two disciplines developed independently through observation with the temperaments in the natural world. This unit includes the history of Unani medicine, [Unani medicine ](https://www.schoolofhealth.com/be-better/natural-health-definitions/unani-tibb/)concepts (the body, the Seven Natural Principles, the Four Elements, the Four States of Matter, temperament, the Humours), the maintenance of health (the Six Essential Causes, Balance and Imbalance, concepts of disease and cure, the disease process, raw humours, black bile as a cause of disease, stages of disease, methods of diagnosis and concepts of treatment), the Four Humours and Psychological Profiles. Unani medicine has its basis in the universal laws which were understood by the ancient Greek and Egyptians, as well as Arabs and non-Arabs of the middle ages. The earliest surviving manuscripts recording Greek medicine can be traced back to Hippocrates (ca 460BCE-370BCE) and Galen (ca 129CE-199/201CE), both of whom studied medicine in Egypt. Arabic translations did not become available until the seventh and eighth centuries.
