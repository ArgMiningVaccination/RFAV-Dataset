Most adults struggle every day to find the energy they need just to make it through the work day. There aren't enough hours to do everything we need to do, so we don't get enough sleep. We eat vending machine food at our desks, so we're not getting the nutrition to fuel our bodies. As a result, we guzzle gallons of coffee, soda and energy drinks, trying to fight our fatigue with caffeine. We struggle through our day, collapse into bed for a few hours of sleep, and start all over again the next morning. There has to be a better way. Energy for the life you want Dr. Nirvana has devised an IV therapy regimen that can give you the energy you need to live your life to the fullest. She uses a modified version of the Myers IV formula, an intravenous cocktail of magnesium, calcium, B vitamins, and vitamin C created by Baltimore physician John Myers, MD as part of the overall treatment of various medical problems. Alternative Medicine Review, a clinical journal, reported that the formula has been found to be effective against acute asthma attacks, migraines, fatigue, fibromyalgia, acute muscle spasms, upper respiratory tract infections, chronic sinusitis, seasonal allergic rhinitis, cardiovascular disease, and other disorders. (Alan R. Gaby, 2002) Dr. Nirvana uses the [Meyers formulation](https://www.drnirvana.com/energy/) as her base for the therapy, but she adds several other nutrients and minerals to each treatment, significantly increasing the absorption rate and effectiveness. Her formula is designed to support our nervous systems, helping us to rebuild critical blood and nerve pathways. Tailor-Made Treatments IV therapy delivers the vitamins and minerals of the Myers formula efficiently, speeding into our systems the building blocks our body needs to create energy. This form of therapy also gives physicians the ability to create treatments to address each patient's specific needs. For people with severe fatigue, Dr. Nirvana offers a more intensive version of Myers IV therapy, the Myers Plus. It contains the same nutrients as the traditional Myers formula, but contains twice the dosage of B-Vitamins. And Vitamin B complex injections benefits are legendary: improved mood, increased production of healthy red blood cells, a stimulated metabolism, increased energy, better concentration and an overall sense of well-being. The Myers Plus is designed to help people who consistently struggle to get through the day, need a lot of caffeine, or experience long-term fatigue ailments such as fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue. IV Vitamin C You may know some of the benefits of Vitamin C - it has long been touted for protecting our immune systems and preventing cardiovascular disease, eye disease and prenatal health problems. Now research at the University of Michigan research suggests Vitamin C may be helpful in preventing cancer and helping us to live longer. It can also help fight off the effects of stress, colds and skin aging. Most of us take Vitamin C by mouth, but now there's another way. IV infusion enables much higher levels of vitamin C in our bloodstreams. If you're interested in exploring what [Vitamin C IV infusions ](https://www.drnirvana.com/vitamin-c-iv/)can do for you, make an appointment to see Dr. Nirvana. Hydration Therapy Water is essential for life; it keep our temperature normal, lubricates our joints, protects our spinal cord and other sensitive tissues, and flushes wastes from our bodies. However, most of us don't get enough water - which can lead to fatigue, mood swings, poor concentration, muscle cramps, dull dry skin, headaches and sugar cravings. IV hydration therapy has been used to improve performance in elite athletes. Now Dr. Nirvana has made these benefits available to anyone who wants to feel better, perform better and look better.
