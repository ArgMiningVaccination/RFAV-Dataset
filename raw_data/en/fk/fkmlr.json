In addition, various herbs prepared in teas, such as hibiscus tea or olive leaf tea, appear to have excellent antihypertensive properties which help control blood pressure.

Learn about natural remedies and lifestyle modifications you can use to complement your high blood pressure treatment. 1. Garlic water Garlic water is an natural way to regulate blood pressure as it stimulates the production of nitric oxide. This is a gas with a strong vasodilation effect, which helps blood circulation and decreases pressure on the heart. In addition, garlic is also great for maintaining cardiovascular health, since it has incredible antioxidant properties that protect the blood vessels. One way of consuming garlic is by infusing it in water and drinking it throughout the day. Ingredients - 1 clove of raw garlic, peeled and crushed; - 3.4 oz (100 ml) of water. Preparation method Place the garlic clove in a cup of water and let it soak for six to eight hours (or overnight). After this period, drink it before breakfast on an empty stomach. If you prefer, you can also multiply the ingredients above to have several servings of this infusion You can also consume garlic as a part of your meals throughout the day, as it may be more enjoyable to eat garlic than to drink it. A good tip is to add some peeled cloves to your olive oil for a garlic-infused alternative (this will allow you to benefit from the garlic properties any time you consume olive oil). 2. Reduce salt intake Sodium, which is a key component of salt, has the ability to draw water into your blood vessels, which increases the volume of circulating blood. This increases pressure within your blood vessels, which in turn leads to an increase in blood pressure. To prevent hypertension, you should consume less than 2300 mg of sodium per day. Those who have already been diagnosed with hypertension should reduce their sodium intake to 1500 mg - 2300 mg per day. 3.
