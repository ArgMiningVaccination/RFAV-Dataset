That's where Researcher comes in: we're simplifying discovery and making important discussions happen. With over 19,000 sources, including peer-reviewed journals, preprints, blogs, universities, podcasts and Live events across 10 research areas, you'll never miss what's important to you. It's like social media, but better. Oh, and we should mention - it's free. Researcher displays publicly available abstracts and doesn't host any full article content. If the content is open access, we will direct clicks from the abstracts to the publisher website and display the PDF copy on our platform.
