In addition to the UCI Student Health Center website, please visit the [UC SHIP website](https://www.ucop.edu/ucship/) at the UC Office of the President for important and useful information regarding your health insurance coverage. Check out this [how to use UC SHIP video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBWOWJkTHmg&feature=youtu.be) produced by UC SHIP. There is no out-of-pocket cost to students covered by UC SHIP for the COVID-19 and other required vaccines as these services are considered \"preventative care\". If a student receives a vaccination at an off-campus clinic, then they must obtain a referral from SHC's Insurance Services Department in order for the vaccine provider to be reimbursed by Anthem (UC SHIP's carrier). To request a referral prior to being vaccinated or to request a retroactive referral after being vaccinated: Please note that all communications with SHC's Insurance Services department regarding referrals must be submitted via the [Student Health Patient Portal](https://osh.chs.uci.edu/) in order to ensure confidentiality, privacy and security of your protected health information (PHI) and/or personally identifiable information (PII). To request a referral prior to being vaccinated or to request a retroactive referral after being vaccinated, please submit a request via the [Student Health Patient Portal](https://osh.chs.uci.edu/): - On the portal homepage, Go to \"Messages\" - Select \"New Message\" - Select \"SHC - Insurance: Referral Request and Other General Inquiries\" To send documents securely to Insurance Services, please upload the document(s) on the [Student Health Patient Portal](https://osh.chs.uci.edu/): - Go to \"Clearances/Uploads\" - Select \"SHC Insurance Department\" Note that, if the vaccine is received at a retail pharmacy, then a referral from SHC is not required. In accordance with CDC/CMS guidance, vaccine providers may not bill patients directly either for the vaccines or for vaccine administration fees. If students receive the vaccine(s) and subsequently receive a notice from their vaccine provider requesting additional information due to the claim being denied by Anthem, then they should immediately contact the Insurance Services Department at UCI Student Health Center to request that a retroactive referral be faxed to the provider's office and/or billing department as soon as possible. Students should also contact the provider's office and/or billing department immediately upon receiving a bill to advise them that a retroactive referral will be requested. The provider can then resubmit the claim to Anthem with the referral and be reimbursed accordingly. [ When does UC SHIP coverage begin? Can I waive UC SHIP if I have other health insurance coverage and receive a refund of the associated fees? ](#collapse-1-1) For continuing students already enrolled in UC SHIP, coverage extends through the entire 2022-23 academic year or 9-24-2023. For all new, incoming undergraduate and graduate students entering UCI in Fall 2023, coverage begins 9-25-2023. For students who wish to waive UC SHIP, please visit SHC's website here for detailed information >>> [Waiving UC SHIP](https://shc.uci.edu/insurance/waiving-ship). As is always the case, a waiver will only be approved if the student can demonstrate that the health insurance plan with which they are waiving complies with UC's waiver criteria. Please note that separate waiver periods are established for programs that start during the Summer and/or \"early start\" programs such as School of Medicine and School of Law. [ Is my UC SHIP health insurance coverage still active during periods when I am away from campus and/or not living on campus? ](#collapse-1-2) Yes. UC SHIP coverage remains in effect for the entire academic year and regardless of the student's location during breaks, their residence, etc... As a reminder, UC SHIP is a comprehensive health insurance plan that includes medical, mental health, dental, vision and pharmacy benefits. The plan features 24/7, year-round, world-wide coverage utilizing the Anthem Blue Cross Prudent Buyer PPO network. For AY 2023-24, the corresponding UC SHIP coverage begins 9-18-2023 for the vast majority of incoming students who are on the quarter system. \"Early start\" graduate programs (e.g., School of Law, School of Medicine, MSBA) have varying coverage start dates depending upon the start date of their respective programs. The 9-18-2023 coverage start date is one week prior to the start of the Fall 2023 term. This \"extended\" coverage was approved by campus leadership in order to provide health insurance coverage for students who must arrive on campus prior to the official academic term start date (i.e., 9-25-2023) to attend mandatory orientations and events including housing related activities. However, The 9-18-2023 coverage start date applies regardless of the student's place of residence and mode of academic instruction during the Fall 2023 term. If you have been approved for remote learning, then you should have submitted an attestation as a \"Non-Covered Individual\" (NCI) in accordance with the University's COVID policy. Visit [here](https://shc.uci.edu/immunization-requirements/exemptions) for additional information. As a non-covered individual, you are attesting that you will not access any campus facilities during any term in which you attest as \"NCI\". As an alternative, you can ask to be scheduled for a video telehealth visit with your SHC provider. In addition, during the period of time that you will be approved for remote learning, SHC's Insurance Services department can generate a referral for you to see an in-network primary care provider in your community. Contact Insurance Services at [shc-insurance@uci.edu](mailto:shc-insurance@uci.edu) or 949-824-2388. Please note that all Insurance Services staff continue to work remotely during the Fall 2023 term although this arrangement is subject to change in the future. Yes. There are currently several telehealth options for students that are covered benefits under the UC SHIP plan: Option #1: Primary Care and Psychiatry telephone and video consultations with a SHC primary care provider or psychiatrist are available at UCI Student Health Center by appointment. Certain types of conditions or procedures may require an in-office appointment as determined by the provider. SHC-based teleheath encounters are currently covered by UC SHIP. Please be advised that telehealth visits with students who are currently residing outside of California could be suspended pending guidance from the University's health care legal counsel in light of the differences in regulations among the states related to the provision of health care across state lines.

Also, please check the [Counseling Center](https://counseling.uci.edu/) website for information regarding telehealth counseling and behavioral health services that are available from the Counseling Center. Option #2: Another telehealth option for students for primary care and mental health care services is Anthem's telehealth platform known as LiveHealth Online (LHO). LHO enables the student to video chat with board certified physicians, psychiatrists and counselors for conditions such as: - Rashes, minor cuts and scrapes - Stress, anxiety and other mental health concerns - Coughs, colds, and other symptoms associated with mild respiratory infections - And much more The co-pay for a LHO primary care or mental health consultation for UC SHIP enrolled students is $10.00.

A: For students enrolled in UC SHIP, Student Health Center is your primary care provider. All care must begin at SHC. For services not provided at SHC, your SHC primary care provider would generate a referral to a community provider. Referrals to off-campus providers require an appointment with your SHC primary care provider first unless the student is located beyond fifty (50) miles from campus at the time of the request and/or is approved for remote learning. Exceptions: Referrals for off-campus behavioral health services and chiropractic/podiatry/acupuncture services do not require that you visit a SHC provider first. Referrals to off-campus primary care providers are rarely approved; only for special circumstances; and require an appointment with a SHC primary care provider first before the referral will be considered. For questions and additional information and/or to request a referral, please note that all communications with SHC's Insurance Services department regarding this type of request must be submitted via the [Student Health Patient Portal](https://osh.chs.uci.edu/) in order to ensure confidentiality, privacy and security of your protected health information (PHI) and/or personally identifiable information (PII).

In general, the student must be located beyond fifty (50) miles from campus or approved for remote learning. Otherwise, the student must visit a SHC primary care provider first to discuss the reason(s) for the special request. Please note that all communications with SHC's Insurance Services department regarding this type of request must be submitted via the [Student Health Patient Portal](https://osh.chs.uci.edu/) in order to ensure confidentiality, privacy and security of your protected health information (PHI) and/or personally identifiable information (PII).

Do I need a new referral to see a provider closer to my current place of residence? ](#collapse-1-10) Yes. Note that referrals to continue care with an off-campus provider must be renewed at the start of each new plan year which coincides with the start of the Fall term. Please note that all communications with SHC's Insurance Services department regarding this type of request must be submitted via the [Student Health Patient Portal](https://osh.chs.uci.edu/) in order to ensure confidentiality, privacy and security of your protected health information (PHI) and/or personally identifiable information (PII). Please submit a request via the [Student Health Patient Portal](https://osh.chs.uci.edu/) by sending a message to include the new provider information so that your referral can be updated and fax'd to the new provider. - On the portal homepage, Go to \"Messages\" - Select \"New Message\" - Select \"SHC - Insurance: Referral Request and Other General Inquiries\" To send documents securely to Insurance Services, please upload the document(s) on the [Student Health Patient Portal](https://osh.chs.uci.edu/): - Go to \"Clearances/Uploads\" - Select \"SHC Insurance Department\" [ How much is my out-of-pocket costs for various services (e.g., COVID-19 related testing and other services; office visit co-pays to see an off-campus provider; coinsurance percentage for diagnostic lab tests, x-rays or other imaging studies)? ](#collapse-1-11) A.: UC SHIP will reduce the student cost share to $0 for all medically necessary screening, testing and treatment for COVID-19 in a manner consistent with directives issued by the CA Department of Managed Care and the CA Department of Insurance. Cost sharing includes, but is not limited to, copays, deductibles or coinsurance. Medically necessary screening, testing and treatment for COVID-19 may include hospital services (including emergency department), urgent care visits, provider office visits, telehealth encounters (e.g., LiveHealth Online) and clinical labs where the purpose of the visit is to be screened, tested and/or treated for COVID-19. Administrative testing (e.g. travel clearance, work clearance, etc.) for COVID-19 is not covered by UC SHIP. This is very similar to testing required for SCUBA certifications, DMV commercial driver's license certifications, work-related clearances, etc... In these scenarios, testing is a function of the activity the patient has electively decided to participate in, and is unrelated to their medical care. Medically necessary screening, testing and treatment are covered services under UC SHIP. The CARES Act and Governor Newsom's Executive order at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic require federal or CA insurance plans to cover all medically necessary testing for COVID-19. The majority of cases that meet \"medically necessary\" criteria (as determined by their evaluating clinician) will be symptomatic patients. There are, however, asymptomatic patients in which testing might be determined to be medically necessary. For instance, there are a range of scenarios where COVID-19 testing of an asymptomatic patient would be clinically indicated, such as prior to surgery with an anticipated prolonged intubation or a bone-marrow transplant; prior to initiating therapy with an immune-modulating agent or chemotherapy, prior to a resident returning to a nursing home, etc. In addition, the CDC also recommends that asymptomatic people who meet the CDC definition of having \"close contact\" with a diagnosed case of COVID-19 should also be tested, and this makes the case for being medically necessary, due to meeting both of those conditions. The CARES Act and Governor Newsom's order do not, however, state that all asymptomatic testing must be covered. Many organizations, businesses, and universities have decided to move forward with a variety of screening and testing programs, though these are not typically done through individual's insurance plans, but by the businesses themselves. Many universities are also developing or already conducting research protocols around COVID-19 testing, including several UC campuses. Research activity is not typically covered by medical insurance plans, but by research funding. In addition, public health surveillance testing is not typically covered by insurance, but by public health funds. CDC and CDPH may issue additional guidance in the future for Institutions of Higher Education so these criteria are subject to change. Students will be financially responsible for any COVID-19 related services that are deemed to be NOT medically necessary. For a schedule of fees for the most common services provided by SHC including COVID-19 testing, please visit [Fees for Most Common Services](https://shc.uci.edu/sites/default/files/UCI%20SHC%20Fees%20for%20Most%20Common%20Services%20AY%202020-21%20Rev%2007172020.pdf). For detailed benefits and cost share information (i.e., office visit copays, coinsurance percentages and out-of-pocket maximums) related to all UC SHIP benefits, please visit the SHC's \"USHIP Benefits\" webpage [here](https://shc.uci.edu/insurance/uc-ship-benefits-and-information/uship) (the plan benefits are the same for both undergraduate and graduate plans). A: Yes, the SHC Dental Clinic is open and is offering its full array of routine, restorative care, specialty care and emergency dental procedures. Check SHC's website regularly for updates. To find a dentist or dental specialist near your home, visit the Delta Dental website: [Delta Dental](https://www.deltadentalins.com/ucship/). Dental services do not require a referral.

A: Download the [Anthem-Sydney Health app](https://shc.uci.edu/sites/default/files/docs/Sydney Step by Step.pdf) flier for instructions on how to get your medical ID card.

The UCI Student Health Center and the Student Health Services at the other UC campuses all offer reciprocal access to care to currently registered students under the same conditions that apply to its own students. If you visit an SHS at another campus, you may need to pay out-of-pocket and be reimbursed for any services you receive if that SHS does not participate in the UC Student Health Insurance Plan (UC SHIP). Please check the SHS website of the UC campus you plan to visit for more information about fees, filing claims to UC SHIP, etc... You should call or email the SHS first to see what services are available on-site or remotely during this time in which either full or partial campus closures may be in effect. If you are visiting the UCI Student Health Center from another campus, you will not have to pay the fees at the time of service. SHC will bill your UC SHIP plan and then you will be billed for any copay or coinsurance amounts that you may owe. However, as noted above, if your home campus does not participate in UC SHIP, then you will be responsible for payment of all fees at the time of service.
