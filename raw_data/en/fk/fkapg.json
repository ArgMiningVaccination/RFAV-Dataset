However, their acceptance and use by the public in endemic areas are suboptimal.

Longer booster intervals will likely drive up vaccine uptake. There is a lack of data to base an interval recommendation beyond 10 years. 1. Introduction Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) vaccines have a very complex dosing schedule that results in a frequently incomplete and/or irregular vaccination status ( Schosser et al., 2014 ; Jacob and Kostev, 2017 ). This explains why despite broad TBE awareness in many countries, vaccine uptake and compliance are low ( Kind et al., 2008 ; Paulke-Korinek et al., 2013 ; Erber and Schmitt, 2018 ). In a recent survey involving 11 coun- tries, TBE vaccine uptake decreased from the first (27%) to the second booster (15%) with a disparity between measured and self-perceived compliance ( Erber and Schmitt, 2018 ). Even after four decades of use there is no established serological correlate of protection for TBE vaccines and there is persistent contro- versy about the duration of protection ( Kind et al., 2008 ; Paulke-Kor- inek et al., 2013 ). The current paradigm in most countries assumes that persistence of circulating antibodies is the \"one and only \" mechanism that mediates protection. In the label, booster doses of TBE vaccines are currently indicated after 3- or 5-years post-primary or booster doses depending on age. However, mainly in the last decade, several studies have documented that the long-term seropersistence and thus protection * Corresponding author at: UZH / EBPI, Hirschengraben 84, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland.

In March 2006, the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) endorsed the recommen- dation of the Federal Vaccination Commission that booster doses of TBE vaccine for all age groups should be given every 10 years after the third dose ( BAG, 2006 ). In 2014, the Finnish Ministry of Health also recom- mended a 10-year booster interval after the 4th dose although with several restrictions (Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, 2014). FSME-IMMUN is one of the two TBE vaccines licensed in Western Europe ( Hombach et al., 2018 ; Ruzek et al., 2019 ). With regard to the FSME-IMMUN dosing schedule, the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) reads: \"Extending the interval between any of the doses (pri- mary vaccination schedule and booster doses) may leave subjects with inadequate protection against infection (section 5.1). \" We conducted a systematic review including data on seropersistence, immune memory, and vaccine breakthroughs after three primary doses to evaluate whether a longer interval before a booster dose is warranted. This Fig. 1. Flowchart showing the selection of publications from 2001 to 2020. R. Steffen et al. Ticks and Tick-borne Diseases 12 (2021) 101779 3review does not analyze the data from the other Western European TBE vaccine, Encepur, as no effectiveness data are published and data on boostability after missed doses are limited ( Galgani et al., 2017 ; Beran et al., 2019 ; Costantini et al., 2020 ). 2. Methods This systematic literature review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines ( Moher et al., 2009 ; Page et al., 2016 ). A search in PubMed using the string ((Tick borne encephalitis) OR (TBE)) AND (Vaccin*) was performed for the January 2001 to July 2020 period. Studies performed with the previous formulation of FSME-IMMUN containing thiomersal (eliminated 1996) and mouse brain protein (eliminated 2001) were not included. Clinical trials involving the cur- rent FSME-IMMUN were searched in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The articles identified from the searches were assessed for relevance in two steps. In the first step the first author (R.S.) eval- uated the titles of all publications; in case of doubt about the relevance of the content, the abstract was screened. Included for a primary screen were any articles reporting the humoral response, serology, particularly seropersistence, immune memory, efficacy or effectiveness, and vaccine failures or breakthroughs related to FSME-IMMUN. Non-English, non-German, non-French-language publications, those focusing on Encepur or non-Western TBE vaccines, and those focusing only on pe- diatric populations were excluded. In the second step with full text screening, review articles summarizing data previously presented in original publications or articles, which did not include the outcomes of interest were excluded. Additional references were obtained from cita- tions in relevant publications and websites published by the European Centre for Disease Protection and Control (ECDC) and the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (Bundesamt f\u00fcr Gesundheit, BAG). Data were extracted from all selected articles and either included in the text or in tables under the appropriate headings. The risk of study selection bias was minimal as all articles of relevance were included; the risk related to interpretation will be discussed later. 3. Results As shown in Fig. 1 the search in PubMed provided 789 titles and 97 publications were included in the analysis. 3.1. Immunological surrogates of protection It is widely accepted that the mechanism of protection induced by TBE vaccination is mediated by circulating antibodies in the blood measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and/or by a confirmatory neutralization test (NT). The ELISA test used in clinical trials of FSME-IMMUN was Immunozym FSME-IgG, which uses the Neud\u00a8orfl-seed strain as the antigen source and anti-TBE-IgG antibodies were measured in 'Vienna units ' (VIE U/mL). Empirical cut-off values for the presence of specific anti-TBE-IgG antibodies were compared with those based on the Youden index; 63 VIE U/ml were accepted as the lower and 126 VIE U/ml as the upper limit of a borderline zone for seropositivity ( PROGEN, 2016 ; Kiessig et al., 1993 ). Sensitivity and specificity of the test outside the borderline zone were 97.1 and 98.9%, respectively, for the detection of vaccinated or of patients with acute TBE. ELISA results may be affected by exposure to other flavivirus species through vaccination (Yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis) or infection (Dengue, West Nile), which may result in cross-reactive IgG and false positive test results ( Dobler et al., 1996 ; WHO, 2011 ; Kollar- itsch et al., 2012 ). NT titers are typically used as surrogate markers for protection. However, since assays used to measure TBEV-NT antibodies differ widely, there is not an established threshold that can be applied uni- formly to all vaccines ( Kollaritsch et al., 2012 ). For the clinical devel- opmental program of FSME-IMMUN the \"golden test standard \" is the Adner method ( Adner et al., 2001 ) and a NT of 1:10 has is usually considered a \"positive result \". 3.2. Seropersistence Relevant data on seropersistence are available after the 3-dose pri- mary schedule and after the fourth dose (i.e., the first booster dose). Early studies conducted with FSME-IMMUN in all age groups showed that almost all individuals remained seropositive up to 11 years following a three-dose primary schedule ( Kunz et al., 1991 ). In another study among 347 adults seropositivity determined by ELISA decreased from 99% one month after the third dose to 85% two years later and to 89% upon completion of the third year. It was noted by logistic regression \"that age was the only variable that had a significant influence on the subject 's probability of remaining TBE seropositive 2 or 3 years after the third vaccination. \" In contrast, weight, height, and gender were not associated with such a loss. NT showed a good corre- lation with ELISA ( Loew-Baselli et al., 2009 ). Seropersistence after the third dose and/or after a booster dose was also demonstrated by Rendi-Wagner et al. in 2004 ( Rendi-Wagner et al., 2004a ). At that time the TBE booster dose interval was 3 years despite the lack of \"formally evaluated trials demonstrating the need \". Age ( 50 years vs 18-49 years), number of prior vaccinations (3 doses vs >3 doses), and time since last vaccination ( 8 years vs 6-7years vs 3-5 years) were associated with lower antibody concentrations. As 100% of subjects in all cohorts tested positive for neutralizing antibodies irrespective of time interval since last booster vaccination, the authors suggested that longer booster intervals especially in the younger age groups may be justified after multiple booster doses ( Rendi-Wagner et al., 2004b ). Based on these results, the Austrian Immunization Board revised their immunization guidelines for FSME-IMMUN to recommend a 5-year booster interval after the 4th dose for individuals younger than 60 years of age, and kept the 3-year booster interval for those aged 60 years and older (for Encepur 50 years and older) ( Rendi-Wagner et al., 2006 ). The Board concluded that \"extended booster intervals would make vacci- nation more attractive by decreasing total costs, and increasing vacci- nation compliance \" without decreasing vaccine effectiveness (Rendi-Wagner et al., 2007 ). In parallel, Kind conducted a series of anti-TBEV seropersistence studies in Switzerland. In the first one, they showed that 46 of 47 (98%) of subjects tested positive 3 to 11 years after the latest vaccine dose (Kind, 2004 ). A larger sero-survey-study conducted in 673 subjects receiving at least 3 primary doses of FSME-IMMUN showed that 615 (91%) still had a specific anti-TBE titer 8.0 U/ml between 3 to 19 years after the last dose and 25/29 (86%) tested positive after >10 years from the last dose (as measured by the Enzygnost ELISA) ( Kind, 2005 ; Kind et al., 2008 ). Swedish researchers assessing the antibody response to FSME- IMMUN in 535 mostly adult subjects found the Rapid Fluorescent Focus Inhibition Test (RFFIT) to be the most sensitive assay to determine specific immune responses against the TBEV which were >90% after 3 doses and >98% after 4 doses. A commercial ELISA kit and a hem- agglutination inhibition test were less sensitive overall, but anti-TBEV antibodies by ELISA without detectable NT activity were found in some individuals. There was a \"satisfactory persistence \" of antibody activity for 3 years after the 4th and 5th vaccine doses ( Vene et al., 2007 ). In an Italian study seroprotection rates among 126 TBE-vaccinated subjects of different age groups were assessed by ELISA (Immunozym) with >126 VIE U/ml considered positive, 63 to 126 VIE U/ml border- line, and <63 VIE U/ml negative. The seropositivity rate decreased significantly with age and time; for example, it was only 20% in those >60-year old at 70 months of follow-up as compared to 70% in those 41 to 60 year old. Similar to earlier studies it was concluded to keep the recommended booster intervals, i.e., every 5 years for individuals aged <60 years and every 3 years for individuals aged 60 years ( Baldovin R. Steffen et al. Ticks (2021) 101779 4et al., 2012 ). The Vienna group assessed NTs among a population of 430 healthy adult subjects who had received the last dose in a standard primary FSME-IMMUN vaccination series with a 0/1/9-12 months vaccination schedule at least 3 years prior to study entry in 2002. ELISA (Enzygnost) was used in subjects without history of exposure to any other flaviviral antigen than TBE. All subjects received a booster with Encepur. Those 14 of 195 subjects with low NT-titers after the Encepur booster received an additional dose of FSME-IMMUN. Eight years after these interventions the seroprotection rate was 87% but it dropped to 77% at 10 years. It was concluded that after 4 or more TBE vaccine doses seroprotection was maintained in most persons for up to 8 years. Of concern were older subjects because of immunosenescence and the very small subset of low responders ( Paulke-Korinek et al., 2013 ). A Belgian group investigated FSME-IMMUN vaccinees who after a primary 3-dose immunization series had missed the first booster for >5 and <8 years (n =19) or 8 years (n =69). In the two groups the pro- portion with positive tests were 53% and 51% for testing with PRNT, and 68% and 77% for ELISA IgG, respectively. The geometric mean titers (GMT) were 64.6 and 73.4, suggesting there was no significant decline of the titers over time and the immune responses were similar between the two groups ( Aerssens et al., 2016 ). In a Polish study, subjects who had received a first booster 3 years after the 3-dose primary series had an annual serological follow-up over 2-5 years and 7-10 years assessed by ELISA and NT assays, both based on the Neud \u00a8orfl virus strain used in FSME-IMMUN ( Loew-Baselli et al., 2009 ). Those with a NT titer 20 and/or an ELISA concentration 126 VIE U/ml were considered unprotected for the full forthcoming TBEV-transmission season and received boosters again. Among 315 volunteers enrolled, 262 (83.2%) completed the 10-year follow-up, and among the latter 215 (82.1%) had been without an additional booster dose. Among the volunteers who completed the 10-year follow-up, 183/214 (85.5%) were aged years, and 1/4 (25.0%) aged >60 years. The gradual loss of seroposi- tivity (measured by NT GMTs and ELISA correlated well) was most marked in the group aged >60 years ( Konior et al., 2017 ). In contrast, another Polish study analyzing risk factors for waning immunity concluded that older age was irrelevant whereas the time since the last vaccine dose and the number of booster doses determined whether anti-TBEV antibodies were lost ( Janik et al., 2020 ). A pediatric/adolescent group of volunteers who had received a 3- dose primary series was recently recruited in Austria and Germany and annually surveyed for a 15-year period for seropersistence. The seropositivity rate at 5 years after the 3rd dose was 84.9% by NT and 72.0% by ELISA and consequently 205 of 358 (57.3%) subjects needed a first booster within this period. Five years after the initial booster seropositivity remained at 99.4% and 97.5%, respectively; these rates were 90.3% and 87.7% at 10 years ( Poellabauer et al., 2019 ). Several studies showed that antibody concentrations were lower among persons aged 50 years as compared to younger persons after primary TBE immunization ( Hainz et al., 2005 ; Rendi-Wagner et al., 2006 ; Loew-Baselli et al., 2009 ; Paulke-Korinek et al., 2009 ; Weinberger et al., 2010 ). This observation led to the study of \"immunosenescence \". It was concluded that the quality of the antibody response as assessed by avidity was not affected ( Stiasny et al., 2012 ). The low antibody response was, however, to some degree associated with a slightly reduced number of memory B cells, but mainly with functional defects in CD4+T cell help and lower numbers of CD4+T cell help are far more relevant ( Aberle et al., 2013 ). In summary, seropersistence studies conducted with FSME-IMMUN show that 1) A large proportion of those immunized with a 3-dose primary series or who have received a first booster as 4th dose remain seropositive for 10 years or longer ( Konior et al., 2017 ; Beran et al., 2019 ). 2) As with other vaccines, over time and with increasing age and particularly for those aged >50 years, seropositivity decreases to a level which arbitrarily has been defined to be protective ( WHO, 2011 ). 3) NT testing is considered the golden standard for TBE serology and it appears to be more reliable than ELISA ( Kaiser, 1999b ). 3.3. Immune memory response Multiple studies have documented the response to booster doses in populations either primed or boosted with FSME-IMMUN; they are summarized in Table 1 . One of the first was published by Kunz et al. showing that 179/180 persons who had received vaccine dose 10 -18 years after their last TBE vaccination, all but one developed an antibody concentration of at least 300 VIEU ( Kunz, 2003 ). Even though different laboratory methods were used, seropositivity response rates shown in Table 1 demonstrate that there is a close to 100% boostability after the second dose. Older vaccinees also responded to TBE vaccination, although with lower antibody titers ( Rampa et al., 2020 ). Clinically, these reduced antibody concentrations are probably less relevant as high effectiveness data indicate (see below). It also has been hypothesized that persisting antibodies may suppress to some extent the formation of new antibodies subsequent to a booster and that premature additional doses have an adverse effect ( Rendi-- Wagner et al., 2004b ). No further evidence was found to support or reject this hypothesis. Particularly instructive is a set of data including 1,115 adults and 125 children with incomplete and/or irregular TBE vaccination history at study entry ( Schosser et al., 2014 ). Their initial GMCs prior to a catch-up vaccine dose was low, particularly in subjects 50 years. However, 3 to 12 weeks later the putative seroprotection rate of 25 U/ml assessed by ELISA (Enzygnost) was achieved in 99.1% of younger adults who had previously received 2, 3 or 4 doses of TBE vaccine. In the elderly this rate was still 96.5%. For those who previ- ously had received only a single dose of TBE vaccine the rates for the younger and older age groups were 94.3% and 93.3% after a next dose, respectively. The older adults responded to the booster with a more pronounced increase in GMCs, but their GMCs remained lower as compared to younger adults in the various groups with different im- munization history. Only a single subject among the 125 children aged 6 to 15 years did not attain a GMC necessary for \"seroprotection \"; this child had previously received 2 vaccine doses ( Schosser et al., 2014 ). The RCT-curve analyses in this study convincingly showed that 2 doses induced priming and the 3rd dose was a booster - as it resulted in an RCT-curve that was almost identical to the RCT curve of subjects who previously had received 3 or more vaccine doses. An unpublished post-hoc analysis from the Schosser 2014 study additionally showed the Geometric Mean Fold Rise (GMFR) to be higher in adults aged 16 to <60 years in whom 5 years had elapsed since the last booster as compared to those with a shorter interval. A similar trend was observed in the 496 vaccinees aged at least 60 years: those who received a booster (4th dose) before 3 years had elapsed had lower GMFRs as compared to those with a longer interval ( Table 2 ). Among the 409 subjects aged 16 to <60 years who received their catch-up dose 10 to 21 years after the previous dose, just 4 (1.0%) did not reach putative \"seroprotection \"; in the 76 subjects aged 60 years 2 (2.6%) failed to reach that level. Similarly, among the 203 children the GMFR was significantly higher when the 4th dose was given (unpublished data on file). Overall TBE vaccination is highly immunogenic and the boosting properties in those who \"lost\" specific anti-TBEV-antibodies clearly indicate that this vaccine establishes a strong immune memory even in elderly subjects ( Paulke-Korinek et al., 2013 ; Schosser et al., 2014 ). Few authors commented on non- or low responders observed both after primary vaccination and after booster doses ( Askling et al., 2012 ). This rate is estimated to be approximately 5% ( Rendi-Wagner et al., 2004b ; Rendi-Wagner et al., ; Garner-Spitzer et al., 2013 ). TBE R. Steffen and Tick-borne Diseases 12 (2021) 101779 5low-responsiveness is considered to be strictly antigen specific at the humoral and cellular level, and there is a lack of antigen-specific T cell proliferation ( Garner-Spitzer et al., 2013 ). Comparative data related to the immune response to natural infection are available but not discussed in this review ( Baldovin et al., 2012 ; Remoli et al., 2015 ; Jarmer et al., 2014 ). 3.4. Dynamics of immune response to boosters According to unpublished data of a large study ( Loew-Baselli et al., 2011 ), 41 healthy adults aged 16 to 65 years who had received 2 doses of FSME-IMMUN on days 0 and 12 \u00b12 and a 3rd booster dose at month 12 were assessed by ELISA (Enzygnost) and NT (Adner method [Adner et al., 2001] ) on days 3, 7, 14, 21, 42 for seropositivity. Values of >126 VIE U/ml for ELISA and of GMT 10 for NT were rated as 'positive '. While on day 3 no significant changes were noted as compared to baseline, by day 7 both age groups ( Table 3 ) experienced a substantial titer increase. By then every single subject had 2-fold titer increases and a >4-fold increase by day 14. Similarly, in a study comparing subjects with allergies with and without specific immunotherapies, and healthy controls, antibody titers significantly increased in all three groups one week after the booster dose by 1.5-2 fold and peak increases of about 3 fold were reached after 4 weeks ( Garner-Spitzer et al., 2018 ). In addition, a recent study demonstrated that among obese subjects with a body mass index (BMI) >30, TBE booster vaccination was effective as well. Antibody titers increased significantly by 1.6-fold after 1 week, and highest titer levels were reached after 4 weeks. However the antibody level among the obese subjects declined at a faster rate as compared to a control group ( Garner-Spitzer et al., 2020 ), which is in contrast to an earlier study ( Loew-Baselli et al., 2009 ); implications with respect to protection of obese subjects are being assessed in ongoing studies. 3.5. Vaccine effectiveness In Austria vaccine effectiveness under real world conditions has been evaluated for a long time. For the years 1997-2001 the calculated rate of protection was 96% to 98.7% after completing the series of three doses (Kunz, 2003 ). The protection rate in the 2000 to 2006 period when 90% to 95% of TBE vaccines administered were FSME-IMMUN, was esti- mated to be overall 99% in regularly vaccinated subjects with no sta- tistically significant difference between age groups ( Hombach et al., 2018 ; Heinz et al., 2007 ). A follow-up calculation for the years 2000-2011 found field effectiveness for preventing disease to be 94% to 99.7% with regular vaccination and best-case assumption (only subjects with a documented vaccination history were included in the analysis). Even among persons with a history of irregular vaccination the average protection rate was >90% ( Heinz et al., 2013 ). Recent effectiveness data from Germany and Latvia consistently confirm this high vaccine effec- tiveness (Erber W et al., TBE and vaccine effectiveness in Germany and Latvia \u2014 manuscript in preparation).

A publication based on 2012-2016 reports included a total of 87 TBE patients who had received two or more vaccine doses, most belonged to the extreme age groups (Beaute et al., 2018 ). As definitions of VB were inconsistent these data are difficult to compare ( Hansson et al., 2020 ; Dobler et al., 2020 ; Feige et al., 2020 ). Reported VB rates ranged from 1.7% to 6.7% of all diag- nosed TBE cases ( Rendi-Wagner et al., 2004b ; Rendi-Wagner et al., 2007 ; Garner-Spitzer et al., 2013 ). Apparently, these rates need to be interpreted with caution, as they depended on the proportion of the population vaccinated against TBE ( Hansson et al., 2020 ). In a \" with a 100% vaccine uptake, 100% of TBE cases would be VB even if the disease / VB incidence is just 1 per 100 million. A Swedish group considered age as a risk factor both for VB and for a more serious clinical course of TBE. While in fact 81% of VB cases in Sweden were >50 years of age ( Hansson et al., 2020 ), this observation did not consider vaccine uptake, exposure frequency and duration by age group and thus may be biased as effectiveness is highly independent of the age group in Austria, Latvia and Germany ( Heinz et al., 2007 ; Heinz et al., 2013 ; Erber W et al., TBE and vaccine effectiveness in Germany and Latvia \u2014 manuscript in preparation). Several recent studies demonstrated a relationship between VB with comorbidities ( Eckerle et al., 2013 ; Hertzell et al., 2016 ), mainly immunosuppression ( Andersson et al., 2010 ; Loew-Baselli et al., 2011 ; Eckerle et al., 2013 ; Lenhard et al., 2018 ; Hansson et al., 2020 ).

However, \"protective \" levels of anti-TBEV-antibodies had been detected 4 weeks prior to fatal TBE infection in at least one patient (Kaiser, 1999a ; Kaiser, 1999b ). Other causes for VB not discussed here include virulence of the infecting TBEV ( Lindqvist et al., 2020 ); high infective ( Kindberg 2011 ; Holzmann et al., 1990 ; Ruzek et al., 2019 ); other TBEV properties ( \"virulence \") (Haslwanter et al., 2017 ; Morozova et al., 2014 ); and slow memory reactivation and rapid microbial invasion (Siegrist, 2018 ), which may possibly occur even in the presence of functional antibodies. Finally, a combination of viral and host factors may be responsible for VB ( Haslwanter et al., 2017 ). 3.7. The 'Swiss experience ' with a 10-year booster recommendation Even though the methodology of the studies by Kind mentioned above and colleagues was suboptimal ( Kind, 2004 ; Kind, 2005 ), the Swiss Federal Vaccination Commission in 2006 concluded that there was sufficient evidence of prolonged protection after TBE vaccination ( BAG, 2006 ). The Commission anticipated that vaccine acceptance by the \"at risk population \" would markedly improve if longer booster intervals were allowed and that from a public health perspective this would be preferred even if the protection rate were minimally reduced. As illustrated in Fig. 2 there was an immediate marked rise in the acceptance of TBE immunization since the recommendation was upda- ted to include longer booster intervals In Switzerland: the number of vaccine doses sold rose from 100,000 in 2002 to 140,000 in 2005 to 600,000 in 2006; in 2007 it exceeded one million doses and subse- quently stabilized at about 250,000 to 360,000 doses per year. Although the 2006 publication also included a recommendation with stronger wording (switch from those 'exposed to risk ' to 'all living or temporarily residing in endemic region, except those having no risk exposure ') there were repeated anecdotal reports that the public accepted a TBE vaccine offering 10-year protection as 'a good vaccine '. Increased coverage was sustained even though most people had to cover vaccination costs themselves. The one million doses mark was again surpassed after the record year 2018 ( Kunze and ISW-TBE, 2020 ); increased sales have also been observed in Sweden ( Albinsson et al., 2019 ). In the endemic Canton of Zurich among the population of those 16- year old, TBE vaccine uptake increased from 16% to 75% for 1 dose and from 12% to 71% for 3 doses from the 2005-2007 to the 2014- 2016 period ( BAG, 2018 ). According to the latest survey conducted in 2018 with a response rate of 31.4%, the nationwide coverage among adults was 41.7% for 1 dose and 32.9% for a complete primary series. The highest coverage with at least 3 doses was recorded in the highly endemic Zurich area 50% ( Baroutsou et al., 2020 ). The FOPH monitors the cases of TBE and VB with particular attention to when the last vaccine dose was given and to which age groups. The respective data are presented in a separate communication to TTBD (Schmidt AJ et al., Tick-borne encephalitis [TBE] in Switzerland: does the prolongation of vaccine booster intervals result in an increased risk of breakthroughs? - manuscript under review). They demonstrated that duration of protection by the TBE vaccine was longer than originally assumed. The annual rate of VB did not increase from the 0-3 to the >3- 10-year period after the completion of primary vaccination or applica- tion of the last booster. Even among the elderly there was no evidence of increased risk of VB (Schmidt AJ et al., Tick-borne encephalitis [TBE] in Switzerland: does the prolongation of vaccine booster intervals result in an increased risk of breakthroughs? - manuscript under review). Simi- larly to the Swiss experience no significant change in the field Table 3 Rapidity of antibody induction after booster with dose #3 (Pfizer, unpublished details from published study ( Loew-Baselli et al., 2011 ).

Steffen et al. Ticks and Tick-borne Diseases 12 (2021) 101779 8effectiveness was noted after the Austrian Advisory Board for Vaccina- tion increased the interval for booster vaccinations in 2003 from 3 to 5 years for those aged 60 years ( Heinz et al., 2007 ). 4. Discussion 4.1. Applying knowledge from other vaccines to TBE immunization TBE vaccine protection is thought to be primarily mediated by pre- existing neutralizing antibodies ( Aberle et al., 2015 ; Heinz and Stiasny, 2012 ). In fact, vaccination with FSME-IMMUN results in the induction of such antibodies in most subjects. The licensure of TBE vaccines and recommendations for regular booster doses are based on this concept. However, vaccine-induced antibodies wane with time and linearly with age (Lindblom et al., 2014 ; Hainz et al., 2005 ), even though in younger age groups they persist for at least 10 years in many vaccinees (Beskovnik et al., 2016 ). TBE in fully vaccinated subjects is rare, even when the last booster dose is administered 5 years ago or 3 years ago in persons aged 60 years. Nevertheless, immune protection of the elderly is of concern and some suggested to frequently monitor antibody titers in high-risk groups ( Jilkova et al., 2009 ; Janik et al., 2020 ). Others recently suggested an additional priming dose for subjects aged 50 years to assure a better prevention of TBE ( Hansson et al., 2020 ). The \"old belief \" is that neutralizing antibodies determined by NT 'remain the standard surrogate marker of protection ' (Ruzek et al., 2019 ; Stiasny et al., 2009 ). The World Health Organization quotes this opinion but adds that 'systematic clinical studies that substantiate this assump- tion are not available ' (WHO, 2011 ). A review on \"immunity and pro- tection \" from Plotkin \u00b4s \"Vaccine \" textbook summarizes the current knowledge on \"vaccine induced immunity and protection \": While im- munity (measured in the laboratory) is the basis for protection (measured in the field by disease reduction), protection in vaccinated persons just like after the respective infection can well be present in the absence of antibodies and - the other way around - detection of specific antibodies does not necessarily predict protection. Moreover, the not believe that protection is only available in subjects with measurable antibody concentrations in blood is to be questioned when a broad variety of tests are being used resulting in titers that may vary log-fold ( WHO, 2011 ; Ackermann-Gaumann et al., 2019 ). In addition, to date serological assessment of immune responses solely focuses on the respective TBE vaccine seed strain and fails to check against a panel of circulating strains. Therefore, when looking at protection, studies on seroprevalence should now be considered obsolete for several reasons. First, seropre- valence does not mirror field effectiveness. In subjects aged 60 years who were irregularly vaccinated, seropositivity was a low 37.5% assessed 10 years after the 4th dose while field effectiveness in this age group exceeded 90% ( Table 4 ). Similarly, there was a wide discrepancy in the seropositivity and field effectiveness in the groups aged 18-49 and 50-60 years. Second, data from the Switzerland show that vaccine effectiveness was maintained even after TBE vaccine booster injections were recom- mended only at 10-year intervals in all age groups since 2006. Based on the Konior data ( Konior et al., 2017 ) it can be speculated that there was no increase in VB despite that most likely there was a higher proportion of vaccinated persons with 'below the limit ' titers. Thus it would be wrong to still claim that 'the extension of the interval of booster vacci- nations is risky for all subjects ' (Janik et al., 2020 ). For the mode of action of TBE vaccines we conclude with Plotkin that \"In line with the doctrine that the immune system is redundant there are multiple situations in which antibody is the first line of defense and therefore a mechanistic correlate of protection, but where cellular im- munity provides a backup in the event antibodies are low \" (Plotkin and Gilbert, 2018 ). Our approach is fully in line with the European Medi- cines Agency: \"Generally, it is not recommended to draw conclusions on the need for post-primary doses based only on waning antibody. For some pathogens, a decline in antibody, including levels below a putative ICP, may not necessarily indicate loss of protection if immune memory Fig. 2. TBE vaccine doses sold in Switzerland from 2002 to 2019. R. Steffen et al. Ticks and Tick-borne Diseases 12 (2021) 101779 9has been elicited (e.g. hepatitis B vaccines). In contrast, for some path- ogens that rapidly invade after colonisation (e.g. N. meningitidis ) it may be necessary to maintain a certain level of circulating antibody to ensure protection even if primary vaccination elicited immune memory. For these reasons, it is recommended that, whenever feasible, the need for and the timing of further doses should be determined from long term follow-up of subjects enrolled into vaccine efficacy trials and/or from vaccine effectiveness studies or disease surveillance data obtained dur- ing the post-authorisation period. \" (EMA, 2018 ). While we abandon to rely solely on anti-TBEV seropersistence, we must accept a close to 100% boostability as the ultimately determining factor for protection by TBE vaccines ( Table 1 ). This has been docu- mented in all age groups for up to >20 years after the last dose ( Schosser et al., 2014 ; Pfizer data on file; Kunz, 2003 ). The rapidity of the booster effect is relevant and as shown in Tables 2 and 3 the antibodies increase resulting in usually high GMFR within a few days. As demonstrated in studies a significant rise in antibodies was detected 7 days after a 3rd dose of FSME-IMMUN ( 'FSME-IMMUN, Summary of Products Charac- teristics, '), which resulted from activation of the immune memory within 3 to 5 days in primed subjects ( Loew-Baselli et al., 2011 ). Simi- larly, such a response is launched after TBEV exposure by natural infection. With an incubation period of 4 to 28 days, usually 7 to 14 days (Hombach et al., 2018 ) the vast majority of infected vaccinees can produce sufficient amounts of protecting IgG in time before the virus crosses the blood brain barrier to cause CNS involvement. Lastly, complicated vaccine schedules with frequent boosters and intensive monitoring present a challenge to meet the goal of immunizing large proportions of the at-risk population. As demonstrated in Switzerland, a sharp increase in vaccine uptake has been achieved after the prolongation of the booster intervals, although this has also been a result of additional factors, such as broad coverage in the media. The primary goal is to serve public health, and not serological titers of limited relevance. 4.2. Limitations This review has several limitations, mainly because of inherent problems relating to serological testing as described above. The quality of the studies was not formally assessed. Varying methods and defini- tions of the outcomes were other handicaps. As usual in cohort studies, the longer the duration of follow-up the more subjects were lost. Very often there has been a lack of data that can be used as the denominator to determine field effectiveness. While we are confident to have retrieved the available studies, a reporting bias cannot be excluded, particularly for publications in languages other than English, French or German. Additional research might more precisely determine the dynamics of booster doses and the interaction between humoral and cellular immune response. 5. Conclusions When FSME-IMMUN was first licensed in Austria in 1976, anti-TBE antibodies were the only surrogate marker for protection. The methods established to predict efficacy as well as the respective titer- threshold for \"seroprotection \" were set at that time as efficacy and/or effectiveness data were not available. Today effectiveness data are available from Austria, Germany, and Latvia, all consistently indicating that serology \u2014 determined by whichever method is used \u2014 underestimates field effectiveness. Vacci- nation with FSME-IMMUN induces immune memory with excellent boostability. In case of TBEV-infection subjects primed with 3 vaccine doses will thus generate a booster response, which provides a high antibody increase in time to afford protection from symptomatic TBE. In addition, more than a decade of observational data from Switzerland demonstrated that the ten-year booster interval showed no evidence of an increased risk of \"breakthrough \" infections (Schmidt AJ et al., Tick- borne encephalitis [TBE] in Switzerland: does the prolongation of vac- cine booster intervals result in an increased risk of breakthroughs? - manuscript under review). Extending intervals between booster doses will reduce costs and is likely to improve acceptability ( WHO, 2011 ). A similar concept relying on boostability instead of persisting antibodies has recently been adopted for rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis ( WHO, 2018a ; WHO, 2018b ), and after some hesitation it is increasingly implemented ( Knopf and Steffen, 2019 ). With the evidence summarized in this review, we recommend extending TBE vaccine booster intervals to 10 years after primary series. Further research should establish whether VB increase after this 10-year period. Funding This review was sponsored by a Pfizer grant.
