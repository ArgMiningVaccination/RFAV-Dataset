Groundbreaking for the campus occurred two years later, and during the following year, Ogeechee Tech began offering its first credit program, Practical Nursing, with 25 students enrolled. Ogeechee Tech assumed the responsibility for offering Adult Literacy programs and administering the General Equivalency Diploma (GED) examination in 1989.Faculty and staff moved into the new 75,000 square foot, $6 million state\u00adof\u00adthe\u00adart facility Fall of 1990, and additional program offerings began Spring Quarter 1991. Ogeechee Tech graduated its first class of nine Practical Nursing students in December of 1990. The opening of Ogeechee coincided with the expansive growth of Georgia Southern University and the Statesboro area. In addition, the establishment of the Georgia State Lottery funded Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally (HOPE) financial aid program in 1993 was a contributing factor in the unprecedented growth of Ogeechee Tech. Ogeechee Tech experienced a $5.5 million expansion by adding three buildings\u2014a Health Sciences Building, a Child Enrichment Center, and a Horticulture Building in 1999. During this time, Ogeechee Tech also increased its services throughthe opening of the Screven County Learning Center in Sylvania. Ogeechee Tech offered its first Associate of Applied Technology (AAT) degree program in Industrial Manufacturing Technology Winter Quarter 2000, with eight students enrolled, and in the following academic year offered AAT degrees in Accounting, Computer Information Systems, Early Childhood Care and Education, Funeral Service Education, Health Information Technology, Healthcare Management Technology, Marketing Management, Opticianry, and Secretarial Science. House Bill 1187, known as the A + Education Reform Act, enacted in 2000, changed the names of technical institutes in Georgia to technical colleges. On July 6th of that year, Ogeechee Technical Institute officially became Ogeechee Technical College. Ogeechee Tech awarded its first AAT degree in December 2000 in Early Childhood Care and Education.During the summer of 2002, Ogeechee Tech opened the Evans County Learning Center. Student growth continued at Ogeechee Tech due largely to the addition of new programs, many of which are unique to DTAE, the state, and the region. These distinctive programs included certificate, diploma, and degrees in technical areas such as Funeral Service Education, Forensic Science Technology, and Opticianry.8 With the opening of the Occupational Studies Building in Fall 2003, a wider variety of programs, such as Agribusiness, Wildlife and Plantation Management, Geographical Information Systems Technology, Veterinary Technology, Culinary Arts, and Hotel, Restaurantand Tourism Management, enabled the college to further expand its offerings. In 2004, Ogeechee Tech paid tribute to the late Senator Joseph E. Kennedy for his role in the establishment of Ogeechee Technical Institute by dedicating the main building on campus as the JosephE. Kennedy Building. On May 13, 2008, GovernorSonnyPerdue signed legisl ation that officially changed the name of the Department of Technical and Adult Education.Effective July 1, 2008, the system became known as the Technical College System of Georgia.Governor Perdue also served as the keynote speaker for the 2008 Spring Commencement at Ogeechee Technical College.Shortly thereafter, Laura \"Molly\" Bickerton, a student in the College's Radiologic Technology program, was selected as Georgia's technical college Student of the Year in the 37th annual Georgia Occupational Award of Leadership (GOAL) competition. In July of 2008, Ogeechee Technical College was awarded a regional law enforcement academy.The project, which involves five other technical colleges, allows new law enforcement officers to receive their basic law enforcement training at a state technical college and obtain college credit at the same time. In an effort to continually grow and expand, in August of 2008, Ogeechee TechnicalCollege began construction of the Evans Technical Education complex in Hagan, Georgia.Ogeechee Tech was established to develop the existing and future workforce needs of the communities of Bulloch, Evans, Screven, and surrounding counties.As a unit of the Technical College System of Georgia, Ogeechee Tech continues to exist as a key player in the economic development of these communities.

Applicants who wish to transfer to OTC must meet the entrance requirements and follow the guidelines listed in the \"Program Requirements/Admission Procedures\" section of the OTC Catalog and Student Handbook.Applicants to OTC who have been previously enrolled at a postsecondary institution and desire entrance into one of the competitiveadmissionprograms (Echocardiography, Practical Nursing,Diagnostic Medical Sonography, or Radiologic Technology) must meet certain specific requirements listed in the OTC Catalog and Student Handbook. Students may be eligible for advanced placement through two methods: transfer credit and exemption credit. Transfer Credit Ogeechee Technical College recognizes previous postsecondary course work by accepting credits earned from other regionally or nationally accredited institutions that are applicable to the student's program of study.OTC requires all transfer credits within associate level coursework to be taken at regionally accredited institutions that are part of the Commission on Colleges. Credit for courses at an institution accredited by a national or regional accrediting agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education andthe Technical College System of Georgia and whose entrance requirements and curriculum are equivalent to or greater than those of OTC will be considered for award of transfer credit. Credit may be granted for formal military schools, training and correspondence courses in accordance with the American Council on Education. A student who presents credit for evaluation and transfer must be aware that the awarding of credit does not guarantee that institutions subsequently attended by the student will accept those credits. Due to the rapid changes in technology and technical information, program specific technical courses will be considered for transfer credit in a program only if the course work has been completed within the past five years. Technical courses that were taken five years prior to admission to OTC will be evaluated for technical currency for course content by the program faculty.A student desiring consideration of credit for technical courses or experiences that are more than five years old can request transfer by exemption testing. Transfer credit will be considered without restriction of completion dates for those courses in academic disciplines. Examples of these courses include, but are not limited to, English, psychology, mathematics, physical sciences, natural sciences, andsocial sciences. A student may receive credit for courses taken at another postsecondary institution if: \u00b7 The course taken is essentially the same equivalent course content as the course taken at OTC \u00b7 The course taken has the same number of credit hours (orgreater) as the course taken at OTC \u00b7 An official transcript is on file in the student's admission file from all postsecondary institutions attended and \u00b7 A grade of \"C\" or higher has been earned for the course to be transferred. A grade of \"TR\" will be entered on the permanent record if credit is awarded.The hours will not be computed in the grade point average or appear on the quarterly grade report. For competitive admissions programs, grades for credit earned as transfer credit will be evaluated for GPAand calculated into the GPA under consideration for program admission. A student who has attended a previous college and is eligible for transfer of credit for English and math is not required to take the COMPASS placement exam.However, if the student for any reason takes the exam and scores indicate the need for a Learning Support class, the student forfeits evaluationof his/hertranscript and the scores on the exam will determine placement, except in thecase of a competitive admissionprogram.19 Transient Courses A transient student is a student who is currently enrolled at one postsecondary institution seeking to take classes at anotherpostsecondary institution.At OTC, students must obtain permission from their program advisor before applying as a transient student to other postsecondary institutions. To ensure coursework and learning outcomes are at the collegiate level, OTC requires that associate degree level educational coursework taken as a transient student be taken at a regionally accreditedinstitution.However, if students cannot find the associate degree course offered at a regionally accredited college, they must request a \"Faculty Credentials Form\" be sent from the Registrar's office at OTC to the Registrar of the non\u00adregionally accredited host institution. Grading procedures for transient students are the same as for traditional students. Therefore, the transient student's grade will be sent from the host school to OTC (home school) for recording of the grade upon completion of the course.The grade becomes a part of the student's permanent record.The hours will be computed in the grade point average and will appear on the student's transcript. Armed Services Credit Credit may be awarded for education/training experiences in the Armed Services. Such experiences must be certified by the American Council on Education (identified in the Council's publication:Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services). Credit will be given on the basis of individual evaluation. Credible military experience must closely correspond to course(s) in the OTC curriculum in content and competencies. Foreign Earned Credit Credit may be awarded based upon an evaluation performed by an independent evaluation service.Applications are available in the Admissions Office.The Registrar will make the final decision regarding the award of transfer credit. Grade points will not be assigned to transfer credit. Institutional Exemption Exam A student may receive credit for courses by passingan exemption examination only if the student has never attempted the course nor made a grade of D or F in an equivalent course at OTC or another postsecondary institution.A student cannot withdraw from a course and register to take an exemption examination within the same quarter nor can a student take an exemption examination if he/she is currently registered for the course. Students wishing to pursue credit by examination must: \u00b7 Be admitted and enrolled in a program of study at Ogeechee Technical College \u00b7 Be able to present evidence which would indicate that the student has the education, training, or work experience similar to that given in a course being challenged,and not a faculty member from his/her program \u00b7 Complete theApplication for Credit byExamination form, and obtain approval from the student's academic advisor and the instructor responsible for administering the exam, the Academic Dean, and the Vice President for Academic Affairs \u00b7 Take the application to the Business Office in Building 600 (JEK Annex) and pay the TCSG approvednon\u00ad refundable fee for the examination \u00b7 Present the application and a receipt of payment to the instructor responsible for administering the examination and \u00b7 Earn a score of at least a \"C\". \u00b7 For competitive admissions programs, grades for credit earned by exemption exam will be evaluated for GPA and calculated into the GPA under consideration for program admission. The examination will be taken during the week of final examinations unless otherwise approved on a case\u00adby\u00adcase basis by the appropriate Dean of Academic Affairs.A grade of \"EX\" will be entered on the permanent record if the exemption exam is successfully completed. The hours for the exempted grades will not be computed in the grade point average. Exemption exams may be taken twice and must be a course or elect ive in the student's program of study. NOTE:Academic Affairs determines which courses are available for course exemption and a listing of courses eligible for exemption examinations is available upon request.20 Residence Requirements for Degree/Diploma Ogeechee Technical College requires that a minimum of twenty\u00adfive percent (25%) of the coursework of a particular program of study be completed at Ogeechee Tech to be granted an award. Secondary School Articulation Ogeechee Technical College is required to establish articulation agreements with interested area high schools to ensure that students receive course credit when established competencies have been achieved. Formal ArticulationAgreement-Ogeechee Tech is required to develop formal written agreements with interested area high schools that give credit based on competencies achieved in selected courses. Validation of Credit-Ogeechee Tech must validate student competencies beforeawarding articulated credit for competencies learned in high school by administering the final examination/exemption examination for the course to be articulated. Transferability of Credit-Ogeechee Tech must honor local articulation agreements statewide when students move from one area of the state to another. Each Technical College can determine its preferred method of competency validation. Local articulation agreements between Ogeechee Tech and secondary schools shall determine the length of time students have to use articulated credit processes.21 CAMPUS SAFETY AND SECURITY Campus Security..............................................................................Page 21 Vehicle Registration and Parking Permits................................................ 21 Parking and Traffic Regulations............................................................... 21 Administrative Review and Appeal.......................................................... 22 Accident Insurance................................................................................. 22 Emergency Operations and Safety............................................................ 22 Hazardous Material/Radiological Incident................................................ 22 Emergency Evacuation Procedures.......................................................... 23 Campus Security It is the obligation of the College to ensure orderly operation, to protect the rights of all members of the College community, to prohibit acts which materially and substantially interfere with legitimate educational objectives or interfere with the rights of others, and to enforce College disciplinary action where conduct adversely affects the College's pursuit of its educational objectives.

Grading System Grades are issued at the end of each quarter using the following grading system(s): For Credit: Grades Explanation Grade Points A Excellent (90\u00ad100) 4 B Good (80\u00ad89) 3 C Satisfactory (70\u00ad79) 2 D Poor (60\u00ad69) 1 F Failing (0\u00ad59) 0 WF Withdrew Failing 0 W Withdrew Not Computed WP Withdrew Passing Not Computed I Incomplete Not Computed AU Audit/Warranty Not Computed EX Credit by Exam Not Computed TR Transfer Credit Not Computed (except for competitive admission placement) AC Articulated Credit Not Computed Learning Support(Institutional Credit): A * Excellent (90\u00ad100) Not Computed B * Good (80\u00ad89) Not Computed C * Satisfactory (70\u00ad79) Not Computed D * Poor (60\u00ad69) Not Computed F Failing (0\u00ad59) Not Computed56 \"WF\" Withdrew Failing -After mid\u00adterm, the student was failing upon withdrawing or being dropped from the course. \"W\" Withdrew -The student withdrew or was dropped from the course on or before mid\u00adterm. \"WP\" Withdrewpassing-After mid\u00adterm, the student was passing upon withdrawing or being dropped from the course. \"I\" Incomplete -The grade \"I\" may be given to any student who has not completed all required work by the end of the quarter. If the required make\u00adup work is not completed by the last day of the following quarter, the instructor will submit the Completion Form for Incomplete Grades with a grade of \"F\" for the course. When a student receives a grade of \"I\" in a course which is a prerequisite to other courses, the student must complete the required make\u00adup work to determine the final grade and eligibility to enroll in subsequent courses. \"AU\" Audit/Warranty-By registering as an auditor and paying fees and tuition, the student is permitted to audit a course, with the consent of the instructor, are subject to the same instructional requirements as other students in the class and without receiving course credit. Exceptions to this policy include certain laboratory courses and supervised work experience. \"EX\" Exempted/Credit by Exam-The student received credit for a course by successfully completing a competency examination on the coursework. \"TR\" Transfer Credit\u00adThe student transferred coursework to the College from another regionally or nationally accredited college. A student may transfer up to 75% of the total credits required for the program of study. The Registrar may confer with academic deans or program instructors when determining appropriateness of transfer request but is responsible for final transfer credit approval. \"AC\" Articulated Credit -The student earned credit for coursework completed at the secondary level. Validation of Credit -Ogeechee Technical College must validate student competencies before awarding articulated credit for competencies learned in high school by administering the final examination/exemption examination for the course to be articulated. Learning Support-A grade withan asterisk following is a learning support grade and is not computed in a student's GPA. Grade Point Average The quarterly grade point average (GPA) is the numerical average computed by dividing total quality points (for each course, hours attempted multiplied by grade value) by total hours attempted in a quarter (see below). A cumulative GPA is calculated by dividing total quality points by total hours attempted at the College. Class Code Course Title Hrs Attempted Grade Grade Value Quality Points MAT 1013 Algebraic Concepts 5 A 4 20 ENG 1010 Fundamentals of English I 5 B 3 15 SCT 100 Intro. Microcomputers 3 F 0 0 EMP 1000 Interpersonal Relations and Prof. Development 3 C 2 6 16 41 For example: 41 To tal Quality Points divided by 16 Hoursattempted equals a GPA of 2.56. Work Ethics At Ogeechee Technical College,it is extremely important to encourage good work habits as an integral part of the instructional program. To achieve this, every credit course at Ogeechee Tech incorporates conceptsof work ethics into the course curriculum. Desirable work traits are emphasized, including attendance, character, teamwork, appearance, attitude, productivity, organizational skills, communication, cooperation, and respect. As part of the evaluation process, the student receives a work ethics grade for each course. The work ethics grades are designed to evaluate and encourage good work habits. Performance factors and indicators include, but are not limited to, quality of work, ability to follow instructions, productivity, dependability, honesty, reliability, attendance57 and punctuality, attitude, integrity, enthusiasm, interpersonal skills, and initiative. Students receive a work ethics grade (3, 2, 1 or 0) each quarter for each course in which they enroll. The work ethics grade does not affect the academic grade point average (GPA) of a student work ethics grades remain separate from academic grades. Work Ethics grades are posted quarterly to the student's transcript via Banner Web. Work Ethics Descriptions: Exceeds Expectations: 3 Meets Expectations: 2 Needs Improvement: 1 Unacceptable: 0 Grade Reports Final grades are recorded by instructors. Official grades are posted to the student's transcript via Banner Web. Academic Appeals Ogeechee Technical College faculty and administrative staff have the right and responsibility to exercise professional judgment in making decisions about student performance and progress. The College is accountable for setting and maintaining standards of academicperformance and is committed to ensuring students are treated fairly in regard to all matters that relate to academic performance and progress. A student will be provided with a fair opportunity to have decisions that are believed by the student to negatively impact academic performance and progress reviewed in accordance with policies and procedures established by the College. Informal If a student believes that a basis exists for appealing an academic decision regarding a grade which prevents progression in a program of study, that student should first attempt to resolve the matter informally through discussion with the instructor who made the decision. A student has five (5) working days to discuss the academic decision. If no resolution can be reached within these five (5) working days, then the student will have another five (5) working days to discuss the concern with the Dean for Academic Affairs. The expectation is that the difference of opinion is to be resolved as closely as possible to the level atwhich it originated, and as quickly as is possible with careful review. It is only when a disagreement cannot be resolved through this informal process that a formal appeal of the academic decision should be made. A student may seek advice from a counselor for support and direction. Formal Once a decision has been made that the informal process has not resulted in resolution, formal procedures will begin. Written notification to the Dean forAcademic Affairsmust be made regarding the decision under question. The Dean forAcademic Affairs, upon completion of his/her review (course outline, documentation related to the student's progress, transcript, summary of events, etc.) may uphold, modify, or reverse the academic decision. The Dean forAcademic Affairswill notify the student, the instructor, and the Registrar (if necessary) in writing of his/her decision with a rationale for the decision. If any party believes that the decision is not fair or reasonable, the decision may be appealed to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. This gives the opportunity to ensure that all necessary and relevant information, documentation, opinion, and argument are fairly presented. The decision of the Vice President for Academic Affairs is final. Repeating Courses By registering for a course for which the student has already received credit, a student forfeits the previous credit in that course for graduation purposes. The student's official grade for graduation purposes in the course(s) will be the last one earned onrepetition. Although all grades remain on the official academic record, only the final attempt will be calculated for the purpose of meeting graduation requirements. For graduation purposes, a student must have a graduation GPA of a 2.0 and a cumulative GPA of 2.0. A student who fails or who does not earn a grade of \"C\" or higher as required for courses specified in theOTC Catalog and Student Handbook within two attempts will not be allowed to repeat that course fo r one year and58 will be allowed to retakea third time on a space\u00adavailable basis only. Before retaking a course the third time, the student must complete an individualized remedial program assigned by the appropriate Dean forAcademic Affairs. Academic Probation and Suspension Students mustmaintain a minimum of a 2.0 cumulative grade point average to be in satisfactory academic standing. Students whose cumulative grade point average falls below a 2.0 will be placed on academic probation for the next academic quarter. A student is subject tosuspension for one quarter if the cumulative grade point average is less than a 2.0 during the quarter enrolled on academic probation. Students will be advised and counseled as to academic deficiencies and given official notification of academic probation/suspension status. Academic probation or suspensio n is indicated on the student's transcript via Banner Web and recorded on the student's permanent academic record. Academic Transcript Request Process Students can receive an unofficial transcript via Banner Web. The first official transcript for a student is provided free of charge. A fee of $5.00 will be charged for each additional official transcript, which must be paid before the transcript is released. Transcripts will not be released externally withoutthe student's written consent unless as directed by law to comply. (Transcripts will be released in compliance with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena. However, every reasonable attempt will be made to notify the student in advance of the compliance.) An academic transcript will be issued within three (3) business days of receiving a written request. The Academic Transcript Request form may be obtained in the Registrar's Office or on the Ogeechee Tech website.

Withdrawals Withdrawing from a Course Since choosing to drop a course is a serious academic decision that may affect a student's progress towards a degree or a student's financial aid status, a student should consult with the instructor of the course, the academic advisor, and a financial aid advisor before making this decision.60 Withdrawing From the College If a student is considering withdrawing from the College, the student is strongly encouraged to discuss this with an advisor or a counselor before formalizing the decisionto ensure that all alternatives are considered. In order to withdraw officially from the College, a student must complete an Official Withdrawal form,available from the Career and Counseling Resource Center and/or the Registrar's Office. The effective date of withdrawal is the last date the student attended or logged into his/her class.

POLICY: It is the policy of the Technical College System of Georgia to maintain a grievance process available to all students that provides an open and meaningful forum for their complaints, the resolution of these complaints, and is subject to clear guidelines. NOTE: The procedure s in this section do not address complaints related to the unlawful harassment, discrimination and/or retaliation for reporting harassment/discrimination against students. Those complaints are addressed in the Student Grievances --Unlawf ul Harassment and Discrimination of Students procedure described below II. APPLICABILITY: All technical colleges associated with the Technical College System of Georgia. III. RELATED AUTHORITY: Procedure: Unlawful Harassment and Discrimination of Students IV. DEFINITIONS: Grievable issues: Issues arising from the application of a policy/procedure to the student's specific case is always grievable. Specifically grievable are issues related to student advisement, improper disclosure of grades, unfair testing procedures and poor treatment of s tudents; this is a representative list and is not meant to be exhaustive. Non-grievable issues: Issues which have a separate process for resolution (i.e. disciplinary sanctions, FERPA, financial aid, academic grades, etc.) are not grievable, and a student must take advantage of the process in place. Business days: Weekdays that the college administrative offices are open. Vice President for Student Affairs (VPSA): The staff member in charge of the student affairs division at the college. Retaliation: Unfavo rable action taken, condition created, or other action taken by a student/employee for the purpose of intimidation directed toward a student because the student initiated a grievance or participated in an investigation of a grievance. Grievant: the student who is making the complaint. V. PROCEDURE: Informal Complaint Procedure: Student complaints should be resolved on an informal basis without the filing of a formal grievance. A student has 10 business days from the date of the incident being grieved to r esolve their complaint informally by approaching their instructor, dean, or any other staff or faculty member directly involved in the grieved incident. Addendum, OTC Catalog and Student Handbook Page 3 of 20 Updated January 25 , 2010 Where this process does not result in a resolution of the grievance, the student may proceed to the formal grievance procedure. Formal Complaint Procedure: where a student cannot resolve the complaint informally, the formal grievance procedure may be used . Within 15 business days of the incident being grieved, the student must file a formal grievance in the office of the Vice President for Student Affairs (VPSA) with the following information: Name, Date, Brief description of incident being grieved, Remedy requested, Signed, and Informal remedy attempted by student and outcome If the grievance is against the VPSA, the student shall file the grievance in the Office of the President. The VPSA, or his designee, will investigate the matter and supply a written response to the student within 15 business days. If the grieved incident involves possible unlawful harassment, discrimination, or retaliation for reporting unlawful harassment/di scrimination, the investigation will be handled pursuant to the Procedure: Unlawful Harassment and Discrimination of Students described in section VI. If the grieved incident is closely related to an incident being processed through the disciplinary proce dure, the disciplinary procedure will take precedence, and the grievance will not be processed until after the disciplinary procedure has run its course. The VPSA, or his designee, shall be granted an additional 15 business days to investigate the grievan ce upon notice to the grieving student. Appeal of Staff Response: If a student is unsatisfied with the response from the VPSA, the student may appeal the decision to the President of the college. The college staff has no right to appeal. A student shall fi le a written appeal to the President within 5 business days of receiving the response. The appeal will be decided based entirely on documents provided by the student and the administration; therefore, the student must ensure that he has provided all relevant documents with his appeal. At the President of the College's sole discretion, griev ance appeals at the institution may be held in one of the following two ways: The President may review the information provided by the student and administration and make the final decision; or The President may appoint a cross -functional committee compr ised of 5 members, including one chair, to make the final decision. The decision of either the President or the cross -functional committee shall be made within 10 business days of receipt by the President of the appeal. Whichever process is chosen by the President, the decision of the grievance appeal is final. Retaliation against a student for filing a grievance is strictly prohibited. VI. RECORD RETENTION Documents relating to formal grievances including investigations, dispositions and the grievance itself shall be held for 5 years after the graduation of the student or the date of the student's last attendance.
