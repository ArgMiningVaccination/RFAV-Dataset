FLUZONE\u00ae HIGH-DOSE QUADRIVALENT contains a four-fold higher antigen content per dose than standard dose influenza vaccines to help create a stronger immune response. It is a quadrivalent vaccine, meaning that it protects against four strains of influenza virus. This vaccine is publicly funded (free) for adults 65 years of age and older living in long-term care, assisted living facilities, and First Nations communities. FLUAD\u00ae has the same antigen content per strain as standard formulation influenza vaccines, but contains an adjuvant, an ingredient that helps create a stronger immune response. It is a trivalent vaccine, meaning that it protects against three strains of influenza virus.This vaccine is publicly funded for all other adults 65 years of age and older. Both FLUAD\u00ae and FLUZONE\u00ae HIGH-DOSE QUADRIVALENT are given by intramuscular (IM) injection (injected into the deltoid muscle in the upper arm). Date last reviewed: "}
