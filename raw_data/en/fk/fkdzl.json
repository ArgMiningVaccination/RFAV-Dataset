The remedies, supplements and techniques I use for treating health conditions are evidenced based, to support the immune system and strengthen the overall constitution of one's health. Our mental and emotional health is also extremely important when treating all health conditions and this is why I love to work with homeopathy in conjunction with naturopathic principles. Our modern world of living creates challenges on a daily basis. For us to remain in balance, feel vibrant, happy and content we need to be vigilant in knowing how to stay well. My quest for updated knowledge and research in all areas of natural health has me attending webinars, seminars and conferences on a regular basis and integrating this new knowledge into my practice. I established my business 'Wholistic Analysis Services' in 1999, and continue to treat, educate and inspire people to take care of their health. "}
