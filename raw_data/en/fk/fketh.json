Our chiropractors at Advanced Chiropractic Group include Dr. Michael P. Hergenroether, Dr. Michael S. York, and Dr. James A. Cochran, who are part of the exclusive list of practitioners that offer metagenics vitamins as part of a wellness program. Although the supplements are only available through select practitioners or by prescription, they are not known as pharmaceuticals, but rather as nutraceuticals and nutritional supplements for their firm basis in wholesome, natural ingredients.Metagenics offers a wide range of natural supplements for a variety of needs. Just as chiropractic care relies on the body's natural ability to heal itself, Metagenics supplements and formulas also put the focus on the body's natural abilities to make itself healthy. Instead of attempting to alter the body's functions with chemicals, stimulants, or other unnatural additives, our supplements aim to help people reach their full potential by increasing natural values. Our Santa Barbara chiropractors can advise on the most effective supplement for each patient's particular lifestyle, dietary habits, nutritional needs, and condition, such as lower back pain or sciatica. We offer the supplements as part of our nutritional counseling and wellness services, as well as a way to enhance our rehabilitation and back pain treatments. We carry a variety of Metagenicsformulas and supplements tailored to individual needs. Several formulas focus on foundation nutrition, or providing the body with essential vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids that can be sorely lacking even with the healthiest foods. Specific men's supplements focus on energy, cognitive and cardiovascular health, libido, and hormone balance, while women's supplements address each stage of a woman's life, from menstruation to menopause and beyond. A number of health issues and concerns are also addressed with Metagenics. Specific supplements focus on cardiovascular health, gastrointestinal health, and maintaining a healthy immune system. \"Heart smart\" formulas help keep blood lipid levels stable and ensure the smoothest functioning of blood vessels and the circulatory system. Those geared toward digestive maintenance help the functioning and microbial balance of the gastrointestinal system. The immune system takes a beating from the weather, emotions, and stress, and the immune system supplements work to combat those factors by boosting the immune system while alleviating discomfort. Formulas geared toward joint health, musculoskeletal health, and neurological health can be helpful in the treatment of sciatica, lower back pain, other back pain treatment, and rehabilitation programs. Such supplements seek to support the bones, muscles, ligaments, tendons, connective tissues, and vast nerve network throughout the body. Other supplements are specifically formulated to support healthy blood sugar levels while still others can be an integral part of a stress management program. Whether patients come to our Santa Barbara clinic seeking back pain treatment, nutritional counseling, or lifestyle advice, our doctors can also advise on natural supplements to enhance treatment for specific issues as well as overall well-being.
