Two approved m edications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), buprenorphine and methadone, have been shown to reduc e the risk of overdose death by 66-80% while patients receiv e treatment2 but the rates of initiation of these medications and re tention of patients in treatment have been low.3 Buprenorphine is a particularly appealing treatment option for OUD because it is not subject to the same federal and state regulations as methadone . A qualified practitioner who has a waive r from the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) can prescribe buprenorphine i n an office setting and patients can fill prescriptions for buprenorphine in community -based pharmac ies. The pharmacologic advantages of buprenorphine are its opioid receptor partial agonist activity, high affinity for mu -opioid re ceptors , and long duration of action that effectively suppress es opioid withdrawal symptoms and opioid craving s while prevent ing overdose by blocking opioid full agonists from binding to the receptor s.4 These same pharmacologic pro perties , however , are associated with precipitate d opioid withdrawal when buprenorphine is started by an individual who ha s been taking an opioid full agonists regularly . Preventing precipitated opioid withdrawal is important not only for the patient's physical and psychological comfort but also for long term treatment outcomes. Indeed, Whitley and colleagues found that individuals who had a complicated buprenorphine induction where they experienced precipitated or protracted opioid withdrawal had lower 30 -day treatment retention rates than those with uncomplicated inductions.5 To minimize the risk of precipitated opioid withdrawal, it is recommended that buprenorphi ne is initiated only when an individual taking opioids regularly is in mild-to-moderate opioid withdrawal , which, for short -acting opioids , corresponds to 12 to 24 hours after the last dose ,6 (although mild-to-moderate opioid withdrawal may occur as soon as 6 to 8 hours after the last dose of some short acting opioids such as heroin) and/or a Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score of at lea st 8. 7 Yet these recommendation s present challenges for individuals who want to transition from methadone to buprenorphine because clinical guidelines recommend that methadone is tapered to 20-30mg each day for at least one week or until the individual is comfortable on the lower dose of methadone before initiating buprenorphi ne 36 hours or longer after the last methadone dose .8 The time needed to taper methadone to a daily dose of 20-30mg coupled with the long wait to start buprenorphine after the last methadone dose may increase the risk of a return to opioid use and overdose during the transition period .9 It should be noted that NYS OASAS and the OASAS Medical Advisory Panel (MAP) recommend both methadone and buprenorphine for the treatment of OUD and do not recommen d that individuals who are stable on methadone be transitioned routinely to buprenorphine. Another challenge with buprenorphine induction occurs when individuals use fentanyl alone or fentanyl mixed with other opioids . Fentanyl has a relatively short duration of action , but it remains in the body for extended periods of tim e because it is highly lipophilic and sequestered rapidly in adipose tissue .10 As a result, fentanyl is cleared from the body more slowly than other opioids that also have a short duration of action. This was 2 demonstrated i n a recent study of twelve treatment -seeking individuals with OUD where the time since their last opioid use and the average median time between the last positive and first negative fentanyl urine toxicology screen was 7.3 days.11 This prolonged presence of fentanyl in the body likely contributes to the delayed appearance of opioid withdrawal symptoms after cessation of use and an increased risk of precipitated opioid withdrawal .11,12 In a published study of qualitative interviews with individuals using illicit opioids, two subject s reported experiencing precipitated opioid withdrawal after taking buprenorphine/naloxone 72 and 80 hours after last fentanyl use , respectively .13 Although conventional buprenorphine induction strategies typically are successful for most individuals, treatment providers increasingly are discovering that alternative induction approaches may be ne cessary for those needing or choosing to transition from methadone to buprenorphine , and for those knowingly or unknowingly using fentanyl regularly . In these situations, precipitated opioid withdrawal may be avoided and opioid withdrawal symptoms minimized by introducing buprenorphine at a nonstandard low dose and gradually increasing the dose over several days while continuing an opioid f ull agonist.14 The opioid full agonist is tapered or stopped only after a thera peutic dose of buprenorphine has been reach ed. Increasingly, p rotocols for initiating low dose buprenorphine , also referred to as buprenorphine \"micro -dosing \" or the Bernese method,15 are being adopted in inpatient and outpatient settings to facilitate a transfer from methadone , fentanyl (both prescribed and IMF), and other short - and long -acting opioids to buprenorphine without precipitating opioid withdrawal .16 Lastly, h igh dose rapid buprenorphine induction with extended -release buprenorphine, a monthly injectable depot formulation of buprenorphine, during a single day in the outpatient setting was the focus of a rece ntly published research stud y. 17 In this model, treatment with standard doses of SL buprenorphine, which is required prior to administering extended -release buprenorphine to ensure an individual has an adequate opioid tolerance to tolerate the extended -release formulation , occur red when individuals using heroin and fentanyl experience d mild-to-moderate opioid withdra wal. If the individual tolerate d SL buprenorphine, an injection of extended -release buprenorphine was administered. According to the study authors, t he rationales for using injectable extended -release buprenorphine were imp roved treatment adherence since daily dosing of SL buprenorphine would no longer be necessary and the rapid achievement of a consistent therapeutic blood level of buprenorphine.17 The New York S tate Office of Addiction Services and Supports (OASAS) Medical Advisory Panel (MAP) convened a meeting on January 19, 2022 , to discuss strategies for low and high dose initiation of buprenorphine and offers the following evidence review to clinical providers and local public health and mental hygiene authorities in N ew York. It should be noted that there are no randomized controlled trials or standardized protocols for low or high dose buprenorphine induction . The evidence is based on case reports, case series , and clinical experiences. Because of this, c aution must be exercised when considering low or high dose buprenorphine in ductions . Nothing in this document should be interpreted as an official endorsement on the part of NYS OASAS or the OASAS Medical Adv isory Panel of any protocols for low dose or high dose buprenorphine induction. Of note, most publications used the term \" sublingual (SL) buprenorphine\" when describing the inpatient or outpatient induction protocols and usually did not specify if SL mono formulation buprenorphine or SL dual formulation buprenorphine/naloxone was used . The term s \"mono formulation buprenorphine \" and \"dual formulation buprenorphine/naloxone\" will be used in this review when the formulation used was specified in the published protocol s. Inpatient Low Dose Buprenorphine Induction Protocols The four p ublished case reports and series18-21 from the United States (US) describing i npatient low dose buprenorphine induction protocols presented at the MAP meeting utilized subling ual (SL) ,18 intravenous (IV) ,19 buccal ,20 and transdermal (TD)21 formulations of buprenorphine . 3 o Low dose SL, IV, buccal, and TD formulations were used to bridge the patients from a full opioid agonist to standard doses of SL buprenorphine . o IV, buccal, and TD buprenorphine are FDA-approved only for the treatment of pain at this time. The number of inpatients initiated on low dose buprenorphine in each case report or series was low, ranging from one to fifteen.18-21 o The total number of patients in the case report s and series was twent y-one. Four inpatients were taking methadone for OUD prior to low dose buprenorphine induction,18,19 two were receiving high dose s of opioids parentera lly for pain manag ement ,19,20 and fifteen were taking various named (i.e., \"heroin\") and unnamed (i.e., \"opioids\") opioid s.21 SL buprenorphine was the only formulation used in the case series of three subjects who were transitioned from methadone to buprenorphine.18 o 0.5mg SL buprenorp hine was administered on the first day and the dose was titrated to 12 - 16mg SL per day over the next 8 days. IV and buccal buprenorphine were used to transition one inpatient from methadone to SL buprenorphine,19 and one inpatient from high dose parenteral morphine to SL dual formulation buprenorphine /naloxone ,20 respectively, because the hospital pharmac ies did not have nonstandard low doses of other buprenorphine formulations and did not allow for s tandard doses to be modified . The fifteen indiv iduals who were treated with low dose TD buprenorphine as a bridge from a full opioid agonist to SL buprenorphine had pain syndromes .21 Initial low doses of IV 0.15mg19, buccal buprenorp hine were used an approximately equivalent dose of 0.5mg SL buprenorphine . During low dose buprenorphine inductions, o pioid full agonists were either continued at their full dose and then discontinued after an adequate dose of SL buprenorphine had been achieved19,21 or tapered during the induction and discontinued after the induction was completed .18,20 The inpatients in all the case reports and series had minimal opioid withdrawal symptoms during the low dose induction and no patients experienced precip itated opioid withdrawal .18-21 Table 1 provides a summary of the case reports and series describing inpatient protocols for low dose buprenorphine induction.18-21 Outpatient Low Dose Buprenorphine Induction Protocols Five published case reports and series22-26 from the US presented at the MAP meeting describ ed low dose buprenorphine induction protocols in outpatient settings that utilized low dose SL dual formulation buprenorphine/naloxone22,23 and TD24-26 formulations. Similar to the inpatient case reports and series from the US , the number of outpatient s initiated on low dose buprenorphine in each published study was low, ranging from one to eight .22-26 o The total number of outpatients in these case reports and series was twenty -three. Five outpatient s were taking methadone (two for the treatment of OUD , three for pain management) prior to low dose buprenorphine induction ,22-26 and seventeen were taking prescribed short - and/or long-acting opioid s, 22-24,26 including TD fentanyl ,26 for pain management . One outpatient was taking an opioid that is available by prescription for pain management but was purchasing the medication from an Internet supplier.26 SL dual formulation buprenorphine /naloxone was the only formulation used in low dose induction protocols for fourteen outpatients22,23 while the other nine received TD buprenorphine as a bridge medication from an opioid full agonist to standard doses of buprenorphine.24-26 The outpatient low dose SL dual formulation buprenorphine /naloxone induction protocols utilized 0.5mg as the initial dose with dose titration t o 12mg/day over five22 or six days.23 Both protocols allowed for further adjustments in the daily SL dual formulation buprenorphine /naloxone dose after the induction phase in response to the patient's symptoms. 4 o The patient s cut SL dual formulation buprenorphine /naloxone 2mg tablets or films to obtain the 0.5mg and 1mg doses needed for the induction protocols .22,23 TD buprenorphine was used for eleven outpatients as a bridge medication from an opioid full agonist to standard doses of SL buprenorphine24 or SL dual formulation buprenorphine/naloxone25,26 o In two of the three case reports or series, TD buprenorphine initial doses were 20\u00b5g per hour/480mg per day24,26, while one case report used a lower TD buprenorphine dose of 5\u00b5g per hour/120 \u00b5g per day .25 The reason for using a lower bridging dose of 5\u00b5g per hour/120 \u00b5g per day for the one outpatient who was transitioned from methadone to SL dual buprenorphine /naloxone was not provided.25 Opioid full agonists were continued at their full dose during the ind uction and then discontinued after an adequate dose of SL dual buprenorphine /naloxone had been achieved22,23,25,26 or tapered from the full dose during the SL buprenorphine induction and discontinued when the induction was completed.24 Some outpatients in the case reports or series who were in duced with only low dose SL dual formulation buprenorphine /naloxone,22,23 TD buprenorphine followed by SL buprenorphine24 or SL dual formulation buprenorphine/naloxone,25 and the one outpatient who was in duced with the lower TD buprenorphine dose of 5\u00b5g per hour /120\u00b5g per day 26 experienced mild opioid withdrawal symptoms. o No outpatients experienced precipitated opioid withdrawal .22-26 Although not discussed at the MAP meeting, a recent ly published cases series from San Fran cisco described a rapid low dose SL buprenorphine induction protocol for seven outpatients diagnosed with OUD who were using fentanyl and heroin.33 o Similar to other out patient case reports and series, the patients continued to use opioid full agonists during the induction period. o 0.5mg SL mono formulation buprenorphine was the starting dose but instead of a slower increase in the daily SL dose over six to seven days, the protocol used more frequent administration of low doses of SL mono formulation buprenorphine (such as every three to six hours ), to reach a SL mono formulation buprenorphine dose of 8mg by the end of day three with a switch to SL dual formulation buprenorphine /naloxone 12mg in a single dose on day four. SL mono formulation buprenorphine was used in the initial days of the protocol because the authors found that mono formulation buprenorphine was easier to divide than the dual formulation buprenorphine/naloxone . o No patients experienced precipitated opioid withdrawal and only one patient experienced mild opioid withdrawal in the first twenty -four hours of the protocol. Outpatient High Dose Buprenorphine Induction The final presentation at the MAP meeting was an open -label twelve -week trial of a single -day induction onto ex tended -release buprenorphine in the outpatient setting.17 o On Day 1, f ive patients with OUD who used heroin and fentanyl were initiated on SL buprenorphine 2mg when their COWS score was greater than six . Additional doses of SL buprenorphine were administered in divided doses until they had received a total of 24mg. o One hour after the last SL dose, pa tients received an injection of extended -release buprenorphine 300m g and were released from the research clinic one hour after the injection. Four participants had COWS scores between four and eleven (mild range) at the end of the induction and one had a score of fifteen (moderate range). o COWS scores for all five participants were lower (range 0 to 7) during the follow -up visits on Days 2 -4. o The five patients received all three , monthly injection s of extended -release bupren orphine and 100mg ) and completed the twelve -week trial. 5 Table 2 provides a summary of case reports and series describing outpatient protocols for low and high dose buprenorphine induction17,23,24,27 Key Take -Home Points Conventional buprenorphine induction protocols that are successful for most individuals with opioid use disorder may not be the best approach for individual s taking methadone or using fentanyl. Low dose buprenorphine inductions may circumvent the need for prolonged methadone tapers and reduce the risk of precipitated opioid withdrawal for individuals using fentanyl. Inpatient and outpatient case series and r eports from the United States described low dose buprenorphine induction protocols that were used to transition a small number of patients from methadone, prescribed short - and long -acting opioids , or heroin to SL buprenorphine. o Protocols using IV or buccal buprenorphine as a bridge medication to SL buprenorphine only took place in inpatient settings. o Protocols using TD buprenorphine as a bridge medication and using only SL buprenorphine took place in inpatient and outpatient settings. Opioid full agonists were taken at a full dose or tapered during the induction period with discontinuation after an effective dose of SL buprenorphine had been achieved. One of the challenges with implementing low dos e buprenorphine inductions is the lack of availability of SL buprenorphine in doses lower than 2mg. o Most inpatient protocols used doses of IV, buccal, and TD buprenorphine that were equivalent to 0.5mg SL and available on hospital formulary. o Outpatient p rotocols using only SL buprenorphine required individuals to cut 2mg SL buprenorphine films or tablets to obtain lower doses. o TD buprenorphine doses used in outpatient low dose buprenorphine protocols were the same as those used in inpatient protocols. Most individuals reported no or mild opioid withdrawal symptoms during low dose inductions and there were no reports of precipitated opioid withdrawal. Based on the finding of one small, open -label trial, a single -day induction onto extended -release bupreno rphine in an outpatient setting may transition individuals more rapidly to a consistent buprenorphine blood level without causing precipitated opioid withdrawal. More research is needed on this novel approach. While low dose buprenorphine inductions appea r to be a promising treatment approach for individuals with OUD, only case reports and case series with low numbers of participants are available to guide protocol development. More rigorous research is needed to examine efficacy, risk and benefits , and best practices of low and high dose buprenorphine induction approaches , in inpatient and outpatient settings.
