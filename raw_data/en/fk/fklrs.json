We want to appropriately use emergency rooms so we do not overwhelm our medical system. In addition, we do not want you to be exposed to people with COVID-19. The vast majority of people who will get sick with COVID-19 will have mild to moderate symptoms and will need to stay at home to recover. We are not sure how long after having the disease you are still contagious. The estimates from experts are between 10-37 days. Over the years, our office has used a number of strategies to boost the immune system. The following are things that have been used for other viral infections and may be helpful for COVID-19. These are strategies that might help to boost the immune system: - Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds, go to [https://washyourlyrics.com/](https://washyourlyrics.com/)to create a washing guide with your favorite song lyrics. - Stay hydrated, drink at least \u00bd of body weight (in ounces), for example, if you weigh 130 lbs, your daily water intake should be about 65 oz. - Get plenty of sleep (7-9 hours), put your electronic devices to sleep at least one hour before you go to bed - Take a multivitamin that contains zinc, selenium, and vitamin C. - Relax and breathe!
