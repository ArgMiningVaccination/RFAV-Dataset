During this session, lessons learned and promising practices from previous initiatives addressing the intersection of domestic violence and health, mental health, and/or substance will be highlighted. Strategies for building partnerships will also be discussed.

During this session, participants will learn about workforce wellness and resilience strategies ARP funding can support that reduce staff turnover and contribute to COVID-19 mitigation that can be adapted for use in a diverse range of work settings and communities.
