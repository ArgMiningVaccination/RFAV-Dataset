What are the requirements for personal importation of medicines? Bringing medicines into New Zealand on your person or in luggage If you are arriving into New Zealand and carrying prescription medicines (other than controlled drugs) either on your person or in your luggage you must ensure: - You declare the possession of those medicines on your incoming passenger arrival card which is lawfully required, and inspected, by the New Zealand Customs Service if the quantity of medicines is over 3 months supply or the medicine is not prescribed to you, and - You have a copy of the prescription from your doctor, or a letter from your doctor stating that you are being treated with the medicine(s), and - You carry the medicine(s) in their original containers, and - You have a quantity not exceeding three months supply for prescription medicines (with the exception of oral contraceptives which can be supplied in six month quantities. Medicines that are controlled drugs must be declared on the passenger arrival card. The quantity must not exceed one months supply for controlled drugs. For additional information on controlled drugs, contact [Medicines Control](mailto:medicinescontrol@health.govt.nz). All other medicines including herbal medicines, dietary supplements and over-the-counter medicines may be imported without the above documentation provided they do not contain prescription medicines. Over the counter medicines may only be imported for individual use or for a member of your immediate family. Please note that anything in your possession that might be considered a controlled drug must be declared on your incoming passenger arrival card. If in doubt, declare it. Having medicines sent from an overseas supplier If you are having medicines sent to you from overseas you will be required to prove you have a \"reasonable excuse\" for the importation. We define \"reasonable excuse\" as either: - An original letter from a New Zealand authorised prescriber (doctor, dentist, midwife or nurse prescriber - the prescriber must be one who is authorised to prescribe these medicines to you), or - An original prescription from a New Zealand authorised prescriber (doctor, dentist, midwife or nurse prescriber). Medicines containing controlled drugs cannot be imported in this manner. The letter or prescription should state why the prescriber has authorised the importation of these medicines which may not have been approved by Medsafe. The letter or prescription from the authorised prescriber must match exactly the name, strength, quantity and form of the imported prescription medicine, and must show that they are aware that they are authorising the importation of the prescription medicine from overseas. You should be aware that your imported medicines may be detained by the New Zealand Customs Service until the prescriber's authorisation has been verified. It would be helpful if the package's documentation includes a copy of the authorisation letter or the prescription. Can I bring over-the-counter cold medicines into New Zealand? A medicine may be over-the-counter in one country, but may be classified as a prescription medicine in New Zealand. For example, some cold medicines contain Pseudoephedrine. This is controlled drug and cannot be personally imported into New Zealand.

How may \"reasonable excuse\" be defined?

If you provide Medsafe with a reasonable excuse, the maximum amount you are able to import is three months supply, except in the case of oral contraceptive pills, where you are able to import a six months supply.
