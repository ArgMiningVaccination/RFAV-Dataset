The 18 HA subtypes of in fluenza A are phylogenetically divided into two groups, and while protection with group 1 HA stem vaccines has been demonstrated in animal models, studies on group 2 stem vaccines are limited. Thus, we engineered group 2 HA stem-immunogen (SI) vaccines targeting the epitope for the broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody CR9114 and evaluated vaccine ef cacy in mice and ferrets. Immunization induced antibodies that bound to recombinant HA protein and viral particles, and competed with CR9114 for binding to the HA stem. Mice vaccinated with H3 and H7-SI were protected from lethal homologous challenge with X-79 (H3N2) or A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9), and displayed moderate ferrets, H7-SI vaccination did not signi cantly reduce weight loss or nasal wash titers after robust 107TCID 50H7N9 virus challenge. Epitope mapping revealed ferrets developed lower titers of antibodies that bound a narrow range of HA stem epitopes compared to mice,and this likely explains the lower ef cacy in ferrets. Collectively, these ndings indicate that while group 2 SI vaccines show promise, their immunogenicity and ef cacy are reduced in larger outbred species, and will have to be enhanced for successful translation to a universal vaccine. npj Vaccines (2017) 2:35 ; doi:10.1038/s41541-017-0036-2 INTRODUCTION Each year seasonal in fluenza epidemics cause 3 -5 million cases of severe illness and more than 250,000 deaths worldwide. 1In the event an antigenically novel virus emerges and initiates a pandemic, the disease burden can be much greater.2Vaccination is the most effective control strategy for in fluenza. Due to antigenic drift and strain mismatch, the ef cacy of seasonal influenza vaccines varies from 23 -85%,1,3and these vaccines confer little or no protection against pandemic in fluenza viruses. The major target of licensed in fluenza vaccines is the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein. The in fluenza A HAs are phylogen- etically divided into virion as a trimer in the pre-fusion state (HA0), and is cleaved by cellular proteases to HA1 and HA2.5Most of the HA1 chain forms the globular head of the HA and this is the immunodominant portion of the HA. Licensed vaccines induce neutralizing antibodies against the HA head; however, mutations in the globular head lead to immune escape and reduced vaccine efcacy. In contrast, the HA2 region is highly conserved and forms most of the stem (or stalk) of the HA. Importantly, recent efforts to dene the in fluenza-speci c antibody repertoire have identi ed low levels of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that bind the HA stem in previously infected and vaccinated individuals.6-11As a result, the HA stem region has been identi ed as an ideal targetfor the development of broadly protective or \"universal \"influenza vaccines. To target the HA stem, several strategies including vaccination with chimeric HA, headless HA proteins,12-15and polypeptides mimicking the HA stem16-21have been evaluated in animal models. These approaches have been developed against group 1 viruses and have shown protection in mice, ferrets, and non-human primates; 12,13,16-22however, there is limited cross-group (i.e. group 2) protection. This is most likely due to a restricted footprint of conserved residues,8,23and structural or biochemical differences between group 1 and group 2 HAs.24We previously designed group 1 stem immunogens (SI) that mimic the native,pre-fusion conformation of the HA stem and focus the antibody response to this region. 13,16-19,21,25-27Herein, we applied this approach to develop SI that encompass the epitope targeted by bnAbs that bind group 2 HA and developed SIs derived from the H3 and H7 HA stem. Biophysical characterization indicated thegroup 2 SI form folded trimeric proteins, and SI vaccination induced stem-directed antibodies that protected from lethal homologous and intrasubtypic challenge, and resulted in moder- ate protection against lethal heterologous challenge in mice. In ferrets, group 2 SI vaccination induced relatively low levels of HA stem-directed antibodies that did not reduce clinical disease but were associated with a non-signi cant reduction in viral shedding by ~30-fold on day 5, following robust H7N9 virus challenge. These ndings indicate that while vaccination with group 2 SI Received: 24 April 2017 Revised: 30 October 2017 Accepted: 2 November 2017 1Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA;2Molecular Biophysics Unit, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Karnataka, India and3Comparative Medicine Branch, Infectious Disease Pathogenesis Section, Centre for Reference and Research on In fluenza at the Peter Doherty Institute, 792 Elizabeth Street, Melbourne, VIC, Australia Saborni Chakraborty and Vamsee V.A.

RESULTS Design of vaccine immunogens targeting the glycan-masked, pan- influenza neutralizing epitope of the group 2 HA stem To engineer immunogens targeting the group 2 HA stem, sequence conservation analysis of full-length group 2 HAsdelineated conserved, non-overlapping epitopes that distinct bnAbs (HA2-subunit) subtypic group restricted bnAbs CR8020 and CR8043.28,29In previous studies, we developed a rst generation group 2 HA SI that conferred partial protection (40 -50%) against homologous virus challenge in mice.19As this SI contained only ~50% of theepitope fluenza bnAbs FI6 and CR9114 (Fig. 1b), to improve protection we expanded the footprint to incorporate ~90% of the epitope (Fig. 1c) and introduced mutations to mask hydrophobic patches of the HA stem (Fig. 1d). With this approach we generated a second-generation SI from the HA of A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2) termed HkH3HA10v2F,18,19however, for brevity the SI is now designated Hk68-H3-SI. Although heterologous full-length HAs share an overall coarse- grained structural similarity, speci c differences at the atomic level make translation of the design framework to non-identical influenza virus strains challenging. Therefore, we evaluated the generality of our design protocol by generating SI from the highly divergent, heterologous A/Philippines/2/1982 S1). These SI were designated Ph82-H3-SI and Sh13-H7-SI, respectively; the SI sequences are listed in Supplementary Fig. S1. Importantly, the development of an array Fig. 1 Design of \"headless \"HA-SI shown. The sequence conservation across all full-length in fluenza A Group 2 HA sequences ( n=5462 for H3N2, and n=55 for H7N9) determined for viruses isolated from human hosts was mapped onto a monomer of the surface representation of H3 HA A/Hong Kong/1/68(PDB ID: 1HGD).

Characterization of soluble recombinant SIs SIs were engineered to be expressed in Escherichia coli30and were puried to homogeneity from the soluble the culture lysate via single-step af nity chromatography. The HA stem is characterized by the presence of extensive -helical stretches. Consistent with this, the averaged circular dichroism (CD) spectraof SIs were indicative of a well-folded protein rich in -helices (Supplementary Fig. S2a). The conformation of SIs was also probed using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements. A red-shift in the fluorescence emission maxima of SIs upon denaturation with guanidine hydrochloride indicated burial of hydrophobicresidues under native conditions, suggesting a well-packed, folded conformation (Supplementary Fig. S2b). The thermal stability of the SIs was also estimated using differential scanning fluorimetry, wherein the intrinsic protein fluorescence was monitored in parallel at 330 nm and 350 nm as a function of temperature. Thehigh transition-midpoints ( T m) of thermal unfolding for SIs suggest that the designed proteins are resistant to thermal stress (Supplementary Fig. S2c). We next determined the oligomericstate of SIs by analytical gel- ltration chromatography under native conditions. Encouragingly, the SIs eluted exclusively as trimers in solution (Supplementary Fig. S2d). The lack of higher- order aggregates in solution suggests resurfacing of exposed hydrophobic patches mitigates aggregation. Rational protein engineering leads to minimal perturbation of antigenic sites Binding assays using conformation dependent HA-stalk antibodies are a sensitive probe of HA conformation. Therefore, we evaluated binding of CR9114 and FI6 IgG to the SI. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), both antibodies exhibited dose-dependent binding to all three SIs (Fig S2 i -j). Furthermore, when biolayer interferometry (BLI) was used to measure binding of the SI to CR9114, both the Hk68-H3-SI and Ph82-H3-SI exhibited high- afnity binding (Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary Fig. S2 e-h), with equilibrium dissociation constants ( D) \u00b1 1.43 nM and 3.30 \u00b1 1.27 S2h). Further investigation is necessary to discern the basis of the unusually high off-rate observed for Sh13-H7-SI,although the high-af nity binding to HA stem-directed bnAbs further con rms the structural integrity of the SIs. Group 2 SI vaccination of mice induces high levels of stem- directed antibodies that compete for binding with CR9114 to the HA stem In vaccinated mouse sera (see Fig S3 for vaccination protocol), high titers of antibodies were detected against the homologous SI vaccine (Supplementary Fig. S4a, Supplementary Table S3), andpost-vaccination sera competed with CR9114 for binding to the homologous SI (Fig. 2a-c). The Ph82-H3-SI post-vaccination sera showed the highest degree of competition compared to sera against the Hk68-H3-SI and Sh13-H7-SIs. In post-vaccination sera displayed lower titers (Fig.3a). All three SI induced comparable levels of antibodies against recombinant H7 HA (Fig. 3b). Against HA expressed on virions, sera against the Hk68-H3-SI and Ph82-H3-SI contained high levels of binding antibodies to wild-type A/Hong Kong/1/ 1968 (H3N2), while both antisera showed limited or low level binding to the cold-adapted A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) vaccine virus.In contrast, Sh13-H7-SI post-vaccination levels of antibodies that bound H7 virions, with only low level binding toH3 virions (Fig.3c-d). Antibody titers to whole virus were lower than to recombinant HA (rHA), possibly because regions of the HAstem have lower accessibility on virions. Notably, neither We next assessed the breadth of the antibody response to SI by comparing the ability of post-vaccination mouse sera to bind rHAsfrom a range of group 1 and 2 in fluenza viruses. As the SIs and rHAs contain His-tags, we veri ed that SI vaccination did not induce antibodies directed to this tag (Fig S4c ). Next, as shown in Fig.3e, post-vaccination sera against all three SI exhibited binding to a broad range of HAs. Moreover, while the sera were raisedagainst group 2 stem constructs, there were comparable end-point titers against both group 1 and 2 HA. Vaccination with group 2 SI protects mice from lethal homologous and intrasubtypic challenge To assess the ef cacy of SI vaccination, we challenged vaccinated mice with X-79 (H3N2) or A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus. In thecontext of virus challenge, vaccination with the Ph82-H3-SI Hk68-H3-SI 's completely protected against lethality ( p< 0.005) and weight the Sh13- H7-SI and mock-vaccinated animals succumbed to infection.When vaccinated mice were challenged with A/Anhui/1/2013(H7N9) virus, all mice lost >10% of their body weight; however,100% of the Sh13-H7-SI-vaccinated animals survived ( p= 0.01), while only 60, 20 and 0% of the Hk68-H3-SI, Ph82-H3-SI, andmock-vaccinated animals survived, respectively (Fig. 4b). When we evaluated viral replication in the lungs, on day 3 following H3N2and H7N9 virus challenge, SI vaccination did not reduce viral load.On day 7 following homologous viral challenge, the Ph82-H3-SIand Sh13-H7-SI-vaccinated had a signi cantly ( p= <0.001, respectively) lower viral relative to mock-vaccinated animals indicating earlier clearance (SupplementaryFig. S5). Passive transfer confers partial protection in mice To determine whether protection following SI-vaccination was antibody-mediated, we performed passive transfer experiments.Undiluted or 1:10 diluted post-vaccination sera was transferred tona\u00efve mice, and the mice were challenged with 10 LD 50of X-79 (H3N2) virus. An additional group of mice received X-79 (H3N2)post-infection immune sera. As expected, the group of mice thatreceived undiluted X-79 antisera were completely protected fromlethality, and 90% of the mice that received a 1:10 dilution of thisserum survived (Fig. 4c-d). Survival rates were 50 and 40% in mice that received passive transfer of undiluted Ph82-H3-SI and Hk68-H3-SI sera, respectively, and only 20% of both groups thatreceived diluted sera survived. Only 20% of the mice that receivedundiluted Sh13-H7-SI antisera survived challenge, and there wereno survivors when diluted sera was transferred (Fig. 4c-d). All of the mice, with the exception of those that received the X-79(H3N2) post-infection antisera, lost >10% of their body transfer of Hk68-H3-SI and Ph82-H3-SI post-vaccination antisera provided partial protection against lethalH3N2 virus challenge and this protection was dose dependent.However, the lack of complete protection in mice that receivedthe homologous Ph82-H3-SI and intrasubtypic Hk68-H3-SI antiserasuggests of antibody wastransferred or SI-directed cellular immunity contribute to 2 hemagglutinin immunogen vaccine ef cacy TC Sutton et al. 3 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development npj Vaccines (2017) 35 Three doses of group 2 SI induce low levels of binding antibodies in ferrets As group 2 stem targeting vaccination strategies have not been evaluated in the pre-clinical ferret model, we next evaluated the antibody response to group 2 SI vaccination in this species. Wevaccinated ferrets according to a previously described regimen 21 in which ferrets were given three adjuvanted vaccine doses28 days apart (Supplementary Fig. S3). On day 26 following the3rd dose of vaccine (day 82), the antibody response wasevaluated. As a positive control, we included a group that received recombinant full-length H7 HA from A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) with adjuvant. In comparison to mice, SI vaccination inferrets induced lower titers of antibodies against the homologousSI antigens (Supplementary Fig. S4 and Supplementary Table S3),and in competitive binding assays with CR9114, post-vaccinationferret sera competed with to the SI(Fig. 2d-f). Post-vaccination ferret sera (1:60 neutralizing titer). We also evaluated the levels of bindingantibodies directed against rHA protein and HA expressed on virions. Against recombinant A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2) HA, comparable Regardless vaccine antigen, all of the post-vaccinationsera had low titers of binding antibodies to wild-type A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2) virus (Supplementary Fig. S6a -b). When ELISA was performed using H7 HA as the coating antigen, the rH7-vaccinated group had high titers of binding antibodiesand an end-point titer was not achieved. Sh13-H7-SI-vaccinated ferrets had moderate levels of binding antibodies against H7 HA, while the Hk68-H3-SI and Ph82-H3-SI-vaccinated animals had lowtiters (Fig. 5a). Importantly, when titers against the H7 stalk were evaluated, the titers in the Sh13-H7-SI group were 16-fold higher than in the rH7 group, con rming that the SI preferentially induced stalk antibodies in ferrets (Supplementary Table S3).When sera were tested for binding to H7 HA expressed on H7N9 cold-adapted virus, endpoint titers in the rH7-vaccinated group were not reached. In contrast, all three SI-vaccinated groups hadcomparably low titers against H7 virions, indicating that despitedetectable differences in titers against recombinant protein, the SI vaccines induced similar levels of antibodies capable of binding the H7 HA stem on the viral envelope (Fig.5b).

After challenge, all ferrets lost weight, regardless of vaccination status with no signi cant differences between groups (Fig. 5c). None of the ferrets developed severe disease, and all ferrets had high titers of infectious virus in thenasal washes (Fig. 5d). On day 3 post-infection, relative to mock- vaccinated rH7-vaccinated ferrets had decreased viraltiters ( p= 0.187), with a further reduction that became signi cant on day 5 ( p= 0.0062). In the Sh13-H7-SI-vaccinated ferrets, there was a non-signi cant decrease of ~30 fold in viral titers on day 5 (p= 0.161)(Fig. 5d). For the Hk68-H3-SI and Ph82-H3-SI-vaccinated ferrets there were no reductions in viral titer in the nasal washes. Mapping of SI epitopes recognized by mouse and ferret post- vaccination sera To evaluate the antibody speci cities induced by SIs, we performed epitope mapping with post-vaccination mouse andferret sera. For the Hk68-H3-SI and Sh13-H7-SI mouse antisera, theresponse to peptides spanning solvent accessible patches of theCD-helix were moderate to high, while the response to the rest of the CD-helix was low, suggesting that both the Hk68-H3-SI and Sh13-H7-SI mimic the native, pre-fusion conformation of HAwherein the CD-helix is largely buried (Fig. 6a, b). As expected from the competitive binding experiments, the mouse seraagainst Hk68-H3-SI and Sh13-H7-SI span the epitope for CR9114, and the response to this epitope was high and moderate in theHk68-H3-SI and Sh13-H7-SI for and Sh13-H7-SIsimilarly the of antibodies to peptidesspanning the CR9114 epitope (Fig. 6c, d). The accessible HA1 region was immunogenic, but apart from the -helix, the peptides covering the rest of HA2 region failed to elicit a detectable signal. Importantly, post-vaccination mouse sera gave signal intensities as high as 15\u00d7 above background for highly antigenic regions,while peak intensities for ferret sera were only 2\u00d7 abovebackground. Due to the limited degree of variation, the antigenicscale for ferret sera was scored as either high or low. Comparisonof epitope mapping of mouse and ferret sera (Fig. 6a-d) indicated, the HA1 peptides and -helix were immunogenic in both species; however, mice mounted an antibody response that spanned moreof these regions and with greater overall intensity than ferrets. DISCUSSION Herein, we designed group 2 SIs and demonstrated that upon vaccination these antigens induced moderate titers of HA speci c antibodies in mice but lower titers in ferrets. In mice, the SIconferred complete homologous and partial heterologous protec-tion, and passive transfer studies suggest that vaccine ef cacy is mediated in part by antibodies.

Importantly, the mouse antisera to all three SI vaccines bound a broad range of group 1 and 2 HAs. This is a signi cant advance over other stem-targeted vaccine strategies as antibodies elicited by group 1 stem vaccinesdisplayed minimal binding to the H3 and/or H7 (group 2) stalkregion, 12,17,18,20,21and a chimeric HA vaccine bearing an H3 stem failed to induced antibodies capable of binding H1 HA.15 In comparison to our earlier studies, where H1 and H5 SI induced low titers of neutralizing antibodies against some H1 and H5 strains in mice,20the group 2 SI did not induce detectable neutralizing activity; however, the ef cacy of the group 2 SI vaccines is comparable to that of our group 1 SI vaccines.18,20H1 and H5 SI vaccination completely protected mice from lethal homologous and intrasubtypic challenge, and conferred partial protection from heterologous protection. Taken together, it islikely that mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell-mediatedcytotoxicity, inhibition of HA maturation, or prevention of fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes play a role in protection. 31-33 Using a chimeric HA vaccination strategy, complete homo- logous and heterologous protection has been shown against group 2 viruses in mice.15In these studies, mice were primed with a DNA vaccine or in fluenza B virus bearing a chimeric in fluenza A HA. Animals were then given two doses of chimeric H3 HA vaccineor a single dose of chimeric HA followed by a dose of recombinant H3 HA. Vaccine ef cacy was then assessed using a lethal H3N2 or H7N1 challenge.15In the context of SI vaccines, it is conceivablethat an additional boost with the SI or rHA would enhance protection against a heterologous H7 virus challenge. In our study, SI-vaccinated ferrets developed antibodies that bound rHA and HA expressed on viral particles. When given arobust challenge with A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus, ferrets were not protected from weight loss, and there were only modest changes in viral replication. Two group 1 stem vaccine approacheshave been evaluated in ferrets; 21,34,35vaccination of ferrets with chimeric group 1 HAs induced high titers of non-neutralizing binding antibodies directed towards the H1 HA stalk. When theseanimals were challenged with 104pfu of H1N1pdm09 virus, ferrets had reduced virus titers in nasal washes on day 3.34Using a different approach, when ferrets were vaccinated with H1 stemconstructs on nanoparticles and challenged with 104TCID 50of a lethal highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, 4 of 6 animals survived the infection.21An important difference between ferret studies with group 1 HA stem vaccines, and our study is that we used a 1000-fold higher challenge dose of virus. Challenge doses of 106or 107 TCID 50of influenza viruses are commonly used to evaluate vaccine efcacy in ferrets.36-39We speci cally chose a dose of 107TCID 50 because lower doses of A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) cause minimal weight loss. It is possible that differences in viral replication would be more pronounced at a lower challenge dose and thatheterologous vaccination may have conferred protection. Impor- tantly, these studies highlight discrepancies between the approaches (i.e. challenge doses of 106-107infectious units) for Fig. 5 Sh13-H7-SI vaccination induces antibodies that bind H7 HA, but did not reduce clinical disease following robust H7N9 in fluenza challenge. Ferrets were given three doses of vaccine containing 50 \u00b5g of SI mixed with SAS adjuvant, 28 days apart. 26 days after receiving thethird dose of vaccine, sera were collected and the ferrets were challenged 2 days later with 107TCID 50of A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9). A control group of ferrets was vaccinated with recombinant H7 HA from A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9).

In comparing the SI vaccines in mice and ferrets, we used comparable squalene-based oil-in-water adjuvants. Mice received two doses, while ferrets received three doses of vaccine. Followinghomologous virus challenge, mice were protected from severe disease and had reduced viral load, while ferrets were not protected from weight loss and had minimal changes in viralreplication. Importantly, high titers of antibodies against puri ed virus were indicative of protection in mice, while antibody titers against puri ed virus were relatively low in ferrets. Thus, this measure may be an indicator of vaccine ef cacy for stem-directed vaccines. In epitope mapping studies, the signal intensity with ferret antisera was 5 -8-fold lower and was focused on fewer epitopes than sera from mice. These ndings explain the reduced ef cacy of the group 2 SI vaccines in ferrets and highlight the need to evaluate stem vaccines in larger outbred species. Our ndings are consistent with studies comparing the antibody response to serial infection in mice and ferrets, 40where ferrets had a narrower antibody response than mice following repeated infection withheterologous in fluenza viruses. We are limited in our ability to compare our observations with previous studies evaluating group 1 HA stem vaccines in mice andferrets because few investigators utilized similar approaches in both species. An exception is the nanoparticle-H1 stem vaccine, where mice and ferrets were vaccinated according to similarschedules. 21Upon lethal heterologous challenge with highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, mice were protected from lethality with no evidence of weight loss, while ferrets displayed some mortality(4 of 6 animals survived challenge) and all animals lost weight. This strategy resulted in good heterologous protection and it is possible that formulation of group 2 SI on nanoparticles ordelivery in a live virus vector could enhance group 2 SI-mediatedprotection in ferrets. Importantly, our results indicate that successful development of a universal in fluenza vaccine, especially for group 2 HAs, will require improved magnitude and breadth ofthe antibody response. In summary, we demonstrate vaccination with group 2 SI induced a non-neutralizing antibody response in mice and ferrets that contributed to complete homologous and partial hetero-logous protection in mice, and that may have enhanced viralclearance in ferrets. Strategies to broaden and enhance the immune response in ferrets are needed to advance SI vaccines, especially in the context of group 2 HAs. With improvedimmunogenicity, these vaccines have the potential to be usedas universal in fluenza vaccines for the control of seasonal and pandemic in fluenza. METHODS Design of group 2 SIs To design the Hk68-H3-SI, using in-house PREDBURASA41software, the contacts for each HA residue comprising the CR9114 epitope wereidenti ed and the hydrogen bond network and electrostatic interactions of the epitope residues were mapped. The HA stem interaction networkcentered along the epitope was extended outwards by iterativecalculations until 90% of footprint CR9114 and the \"initiation \"residues of the -helix (Fig.1c)were incorporated. The residues anterior to A44 2, the N-terminus for the HA2 fragment, are included in Hk68-H3-SI and arecritical to initiate the hydrogen bond network. Concomitantly, weextended the putative C-terminus of the HA2 fragment in Hk68-H3-SI to Fig. 6 Epitope mapping of mouse and ferret antibody response in post-SI vaccination sera. To map the epitopes recognized by post- vaccination mouse and ferret sera, a library of N-terminal biotinylated peptides spanning the Hk68-H3-SI was designed and immobilized onstreptavidin-coated plates. Mouse and ferret pre-vaccination and post-vaccination sera from the Hk68-H3-SI and Sh13-H7-SI-vaccinatedgroups were used to map the homologous and heterologous response. The antigenicity scale was de ned based on the fold-change in signal intensity between pre and post-vaccination sera, and the response was mapped to a model of the Hk68-H3-SI. Panels aand bdisplay antigenic maps of mouse sera and Sh13-H7-SI, respectively, while panels canddsimilarly display maps of ferret sera against Hk68-H3-SI and Sh13-H7-SI. Epitope mapping studies were performed in duplicate in three independent experiments. Results displayed are the mean values from the three independent replicatesGroup 2 hemagglutinin immunogen vaccine ef cacy TC Sutton et al. 8 npj Vaccines (2017) 35 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Developmentinclude interacting residues from the long central -helices. These individual fragments were covalently \"stitched \"together and surface- exposed hydrophobic patches were resurfaced by introducing polar, hydrophilic mutations chosen by Rosetta Design16,18,19,25(Fig. 1d). Additionally, a synthetic trimerization motif, the globular, -rich \"foldon \", was appended to the C-terminus of the SI to promote oligomerization.42 Theflipping-in of the foldon motif in HA stem constructs could be a consequence of a non-optimal linker length.17,21Therefore, we calculated the distance between the C-terminal residue (M115 2Q) of the HA stem fragment (37 2-115 2) and the N-terminal residue ( G1) of foldon to determine the linker length wherein the following conditions are satis ed; coplanarity of the terminal (M115 2Q,G1) residues, and superimposition of the 3-fold symmetry axes of HA and foldon (Fig. 1e). Expression, puri cation, and characterization of SIs Codon-optimized genes for SIs were synthesized (GenScript) and cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET-28a (+) (Novagen). The SIs wereover-expressed in 18,19CD spectra, fluorescence spectroscopy, and size exclusion chromatography were measured or performed as previously described.18,19The thermal stability of the SIs was determined by Nano-DSF (differential scanning fluorimetry) using a Prometheus NT.48 instrument (NanoTemper). SIs were evaluated at a concentration of 5 M and thermal unfolding was performed at a rate of 1 \u00b0C/min in a range from 20 -95 \u00b0C. Protein melting points ( Tm) were calculated according to the manufacturer 's protocol. Binding af nity measurements and competition binding using BLI Binding af nity of the stem fragment immunogens (SIs) to CR9114, and competition between the post-vaccination sera and CR9114 IgG was determined by BLI Octet RED96 instrument (Pall ForteBio) as of 4 week-old BALB/c mice (Taconic).43A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) was provided by the Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, GA) and was grown in embryonated hen 's eggs. Virus stocks, nasal washes, and tissue homogenates were titrated on MDCK cells (ATCC), and virus titers were expressed as median tissue cultureinfectious dose (TCID 50). MDCK cells were con rmed to be mycoplasma- free using the Mycoplasma Plus PCR Primer Set (Agilent Technologies). Mouse vaccination and challenge experiments BALB/c mice (6-weeks old, female, n= 13/group) (Taconic Farms) were vaccinated with 20 g of SI protein mixed 1:1 with Addavax adjuvant (InvivoGen) delivered via two 50 L injections to each hind leg. Mice were vaccinated and boosted on day 28, and blood was collected on day 54. Onday 56, mice were challenged with 10 LD 50of X-79 (H3N2) or A/Anhui/1/ 2013 (H7N9) and 105TCID 50/mouse, respectively, via intranasal inoculation. On days 3 and 7 pi, lung sampleswere collected (four mice/group) for viral titration, and the remaininganimals were weighed daily for 14 days. Animals exhibiting 25% weight loss were humanely euthanized. Group size was determined based on the minimum number of animals needed to evaluate survival ( n= 5/group) and viral replication in the lungs ( n= 4/group/time point). Passive transfer experiments For passive transfer studies, BALB/c mice (6-weeks old, female) (Taconic Farms) ( n= 30/group) were vaccinated and boosted as above and blood was collected on day 56. To generate X-79 post-infection immune sera, an additional group of mice were infected with 0.1 LD 50of X-79 (H3N2) virus. Undiluted or 1/10 n= 8/dilution of antisera) via intraperitoneal injection. Twenty four hours later, mice were challenged with 10 LD 50of X-79 (H3N2) virus and weight loss and survival were monitored for 14 days.Group size for passive transfer studies was determined based upon the total amount of sera obtained after terminal bleed that would permit transfer of 1 mL of undiluted sera per mouse.Ferret vaccination and H7N9 virus challenge experiments Twenty four-week-old ferrets (equal numbers of male and female animals, seronegative for circulating H1N1 and H3N2 viruses by HI assay) (Triple F Farms) ( n= 4/group) were vaccinated with 50 g of SI mixed 1:1 with Sigma Adjuvant System (SAS) adjuvant via intramuscular injection in theleft hind leg. We utilized the SAS adjuvant in ferrets because it isformulated for larger animals and a Group 1 stem vaccine antigen 21 formulated with it was previously shown to induce a protective antibodyresponse. Three groups received Hk68-H3-SI, Ph82-H3-SI, and Sh13-H7-SI. Control groups each received 50 g of full-length rHA from A/Anhui/1/ 2013 (H7N9) (Sino Biologicals), or adjuvant mixed with phosphate-bufferedsaline (PBS). Ferrets were vaccinated and boosted on days 0, 28 and 56,and were challenged intranasally on day 84 with 10 7TCID 50of A/Anhui/1/ 2013 (H7N9) virus. Ferrets were weighed daily to monitor weight loss andnasal washes were collected on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 post-challenge. Group size ( n= 4) was determined based on previous vaccine studies in ferrets36,44and the housing limitations within the BSL3 facility. Upon evaluation of ferret sera by microneutralization assay (SupplementaryTable S4), one ferret in the mock-vaccinated group was found to have lowlevels of pre-existing antibody titers against H3N2 viruses. This animal wasremoved from all analyses. Biocontainment and animal protocols Vaccination and X-79 (H3N2) virus challenge were conducted under BSL2conditions. All work with A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) was conducted inenhanced BSL3 laboratories at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Forboth the mouse and ferret studies, animals were not randomized and thestudies were not blinded. All animal studies were approved by the NIH Animal Care and Use Committee, and were performed in accordance with relevant regulations and guidelines. Quanti cation of post-vaccination antibody titers against SI, rHA, and whole virus Post-vaccination binding antibody titers to SI were determined by ELISA as previously described.18Binding antibody titers against full-length rHA and puried viruses were also determined by ELISA. Brie fly, 96-well plates (Nalgene) were coated with in 20 (0.05%)(PBS-T) or 5% skim milk powder in PBS-Tfor and ferret sera, respectively. Dilutions of heat-inactivated serawere incubated on the plates for 2 h at room temperature, followed bywashing with PBS-T and incubation for 1 h (Abcam) or goat-anti ferret IgG polyclonal antibody (Alpha Diagnostics). After rinsing, plates were developed SureBlue TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate and the OD was measured at650 nm or 405 nm, respectively, on a SpectraMax plate reader (MolecularDevices). To measure binding to whole virus, the protocol was modi ed such that 128 HA units of virus in PBS was added to each well. The plates were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C, blocked, rinsed, and developed as above, withthe exception that incubation of the mouse and ferret sera was performedat 37 \u00b0C. Determining the antigenic breadth of the SIs ELISA was used to determine the cross-reactive antibody titers elicitedpost-vaccination by the SIs. Assays were performed as previouslydescribed 18using a panel of Group 1 and Group 2 rHA proteins (Fig.3e) (Sino Biological). Peptide epitope mapping A set of N-terminal biotinylated peptides (15mer) spanning Hk68-H3-SI with an overlap of ten residues were synthesized by Pepscan. For epitope mapping by ELISA, 96-well Maxisorp plates were coated with streptavidinat 5g/ml and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The plates were washed with PBST, and a 100-fold molar excess of peptide (dissolved in 0.2 Msodium carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.4) was added to eachwell and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The plates were washed and then blocked with PBST + 1%BSA. Next, 50 L of pre-vaccination or post- vaccination mouse (1:100 dilution) or ferret (1:20 dilution) sera was addedto each well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The plates werewashed with PBST and 50 L of immunogen vaccine ef cacy TC Sutton et al. 9 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development npj Vaccines (2017) 35 (Sigma) (1:10000 dilution) or HRP-conjugated goat anti-ferret secondary antibody (Alpha Diagnostics) (1:10000 dilution) was added and incubatedfor 1 h at room temperature. The plates were subsequently developed asdescribed for ELISA against SI. The antigenicity of each peptide was determined as the ratio between the signals obtained from the post- vaccination and pre-vaccination sera. Statistical analysis Groups of mice and ferrets were compared at each time point using a one-way non-parametric Kruskal -Wallis test with post hoc Dunn 's multiple comparison test against the mock-vaccinated group. Prior to performing non-parametric analyses, variance between groups was evaluated using aBrown -Forsythe test and were not signi cantly different between groups. Survival curves were compared using a Mantel -Cox test with post-hoc pairwise comparisons using a Bonferroni correction. All analyses wereperformed using Prism 7 GraphPad software with p< 0.05 considered signicant.
