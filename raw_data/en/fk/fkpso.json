Most of us feel this way at one time or another for short periods. True clinical depression is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for weeks or longer.

More likely, it's a combination of both.

But depression can also occur if you have no family history of the illness. Anyone can develop depression, even kids. The following may play a role in depression: SYMPTOMS Depression can change or distort the way you see yourself, your life, and those around you. People who have depression usually see everything with a more negative attitude. They cannot imagine that any problem or situation can be solved in a positive way. Symptoms of depression can include: If depression is very severe, there may also be psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions. Your health care provider will ask questions about your medical history and symptoms. Your answers and certain questionnaires can help your doctor diagnose depression and determine how severe it may be. Blood and urine tests may be done to rule out other medical conditions with symptoms similar to depression. Drugs used to treat depression are called antidepressants. Common types of antidepressants include: If you have delusions or hallucinations, your doctor may prescribe additional medications. WARNING: Children, adolescents, and young adults should be watched more closely for suicidal behavior, especially during the first few months after starting medications. If you do not feel better with antidepressants and talk therapy, you may have treatment-resistant depression. Your doctor will often prescribe higher (but still safe) doses of an antidepressant, or a combination of medications. Lithium (or other mood stabilizers) and thyroid hormone supplements also may be added to help the antidepressants work better. St. John's wort is an herb sold without a prescription. It may help some people with mild depression. However, it can change the way other medicines work in your body, including antidepressants and birth control pills. Talk to your doctor before trying this herb. CHANGES IN MEDICATIONS Sometimes, medications that you take for another health problem can cause or worsen depression. Talk to your doctor about all the medicines you take. Your doctor may recommend changing your dose or switching to another drug. Never stop taking your medications without first talking to your doctor. Women being treated for depression who are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant should not stop taking antidepressants without first talking to their doctor. TALK THERAPY Talk therapy is counseling to talk about your feelings and thoughts, and help you learn how to deal with them. Types of talk therapy include: Cognitive behavioral therapy teaches you how to fight off negative thoughts. You will learn how to become more aware of your symptoms and how to spot things that make your depression worse. You'll also be taught problem-solving skills. Psychotherapy can help you understand the issues that may be behind your thoughts and feelings. Joining a support group of people who are sharing problems like yours can also help. Ask your therapist or doctor for a recommendation. OTHER TREATMENTS FOR DEPRESSION Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the single most effective treatment for severe depression and it is generally safe. ECT may improve mood in people with severe depression or suicidal thoughts who don't get better with other treatments. It may also help treat depression in those who have psychotic symptoms. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) uses pulses of energy to stimulate nerve cells in the brain that are believe to affect mood. There is some research to suggest that it can help relieve depression. Light therapy may relieve depression symptoms in the winter time. However, it is usually not considered a first-line treatment. You can often ease the stress of illness by joining a support group whose members share common experiences and problems.

People who have repeated episodes of depression may need quick and ongoing treatment to prevent more severe, long-term depression. Sometimes people will need to stay on medications for long periods of time. As with all medications, being sure to discuss with your doctor or pharmacist all the side-effects and complications of the medication is important before starting any medication. Sometimes, the medication can create side-effects that feel worse than the original depression. Always consider this and ask about what is involved in coming off the medication if the side-effects are too strong. Many times the ability to stop the medication is prohibited. People who are depressed are more likely to use alcohol or illegal substances. Complications of depression also include: If you have thoughts of suicide or harming yourself or others, immediately call your local emergency number (such as 911) or go to the hospital emergency room.
