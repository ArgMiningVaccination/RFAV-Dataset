Evidence-based mind-body practice draws on the best available scientific research, advocating the integration of well-documented mind-body therapies into primary health care. The handbook summarizes current mind-body practice and provides an overview of the basic techniques, including biofeedback, neurofeedback, relaxation therapies, hypnotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapies, acupuncture, and spiritual therapies. The editors also thoroughly demonstrate the application of these techniques to common disorders such as headache, chronic pain, and essential hypertension, as well as anxiety, depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and sleep disorders. - Front Matter - Chapters Part I: Models and Concepts for Mind-Body Medicine [Chapter 1: Evidence-Based Medicine, Clinical Psychophysiology, and Integrative Medicine](/reference/handbook-of-mind-body-medicine-for-primary-care/n1.xml) [Chapter 2: The High Risk Model of Threat Perception and the Trojan Horse Role Induction: Somatization and Psychophysiological Complementary, Alternative, and Integrative Medicine](/reference/handbook-of-mind-body-medicine-for-primary-care/n4.xml) [Chapter 5: The Placebo Effect and its Use in Biofeedback Therapy](/reference/handbook-of-mind-body-medicine-for-primary-care/n5.xml) [Chapter 6: A Comprehensive Approach to Primary Care Medicine: Mind and Body in the Clinic](/reference/handbook-of-mind-body-medicine-for-primary-care/n6.xml) [Chapter 7: Professional Ethics and Practice Standards in Part II: Basic the Person with Condition](/reference/handbook-of-mind-body-medicine-for-primary-care/n31.xml) Part IV: Education for Mind-Body Mind-Body Nursing](/reference/handbook-of-mind-body-medicine-for-primary-care/n33.xml) [Chapter 34: The Professional Role and Education of Physician Assistants in Mind-Body Medicine](/reference/handbook-of-mind-body-medicine-for-primary-care/n34.xml) [Chapter 35: The Behavioral Health Provider in Mind-Body [Chapter 36: Existential and Spiritual Dimensions of Primary Care: Healing the Wounded Soul](/reference/handbook-of-mind-body-medicine-for-primary-care/n36.xml) - Back Matter - Loading...
