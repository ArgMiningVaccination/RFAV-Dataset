This is one way you can control your exposure to harmful chemicals. Many chemicals in general cleaning products have been identified as [endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs)](https://www.breastcanceruk.org.uk/reduce-your-risk/chemicals-and-environment/). These have been linked to breast cancer and other illnesses. Natural cleaning products are becoming more popular and can be made at home with store cupboard ingredients, such as bicarbonate soda, white vinegar, lemons, table salt and citric acid. Vinegar (acetic acid) is a great all-round cleaner. Its natural acidic properties mean it can cut through dirt easily. Mix one part vinegar to one part water in a spray bottle. You can add lemon rinds and/or herbs for scent. Never use vinegar on stone or ceramics. These two heavy-hitting natural cleaners can remove stubborn marks, including rust. Mix the juice of half a lemon with 4 tablespoons of bicarbonate of soda to make a paste and apply to the area. Remove any residue with water and cloth. To clean kitchen counters, appliances, and the inside of your refrigerator, all you need is baking soda. It is a great deodoriser and can be used to shine stainless steel. Mix 4 tablespoons with 450ml warm water and add to a spray bottle to use. To clean stainless steel, dissolve the bicarbonate of soda with some warm water to make a paste. With a soft cloth, rub the surface to remove marks and then buff it with a clean cloth to shine. For a dry scrub cleaner that works well in a bathroom to cut through soap residue, mix equal parts bicarbonate of soda and salt into a paste. Add white wine vinegar to a spray bottle (recycle one of your old bottles), spray over the mould, leave for 20 mins, then dip an old toothbrush into table salt and scrub away. It is possible to have streak-free mirrors and windows without using harmful chemicals. Mix 250ml water with 3 tablespoons white vinegar and 60ml rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle. Use as you would a regular glass cleaner. Vinegar and bicarbonate of soda are natural germ killers and, when combined with elbow grease, can help you ditch the bleach for good. Mix one part vinegar with one part warm water and 4 tablespoons of bicarbonate of soda in a spray bottle and shake to mix. Spray the toilet, leave for 15 mins and scrub as you usually clean. Citric acid dissolves limescale and kills germs. Mix 200g citric acid and 150ml water, combined with a squirt of eco-friendly washing-up liquid. This works a treat on shower screens. Ditch toxic air fresheners for good by investing in house plants that naturally freshen the air in your home.
