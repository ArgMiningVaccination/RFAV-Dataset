The Forum was initiated in response to the Hawkins-Stafford EducationImprovement Amendments (Public Law 100-297) which established the National CooperativeEducation Statistics System. The Cooperative System was created in 1988 to respond toCongress' desire to create a mechanism for states and the federal government to work together toproduce comparable and uniform education statistics for policymaking at all levels ofgovernment. The Forum's mission is to develop and recommend strategies for strengthening avoluntary national education data system\u2014one that fosters cooperation among existing local,state, and federal systems\u2014to support the improvement of public and private educationthroughout the United States. Early in its existence, the Forum developed a strategic plan. One of the major goals described in the plan is: \"to develop a comprehensive core system of comparable local, state, and federal data useful to policymakers and educators at all levels of government. The Forum willidentify and define the core data needed to operate schools and districts, to supportstate and federal program reports, and to guide education policy at all levels.\" It was hoped that core data would be able to answer policy and program questions with maximum efficiency and minimal extra burden on respondents. In 1994, the Forum's National Education Statistics Agenda Committee established a task force to identify a comprehensive and dynamic core of data elements based on clearly-definedcriteria that meets the requirements specified in the goal stated above. This report contains therecommendations of the task force for a set of basic data elements that provides the information needed to operate schools and districts, support state and federal program reporting, and guideeducation policy at all levels. Contained in this report is a set of student and staff level dataelements. Areas such as school finance and facilities are not addressed in this report. Additionalwork will be done to identify data elements in these areas. In addition, the task force willcontinue additional review of federal reporting data elements, taking into account the changingdata requests from the federal government. While this report does capture many of the dataelements needed for state and federal reporting, state and local data collectors still need toexamine and incorporate those data elements that are critical for state and local reportingpurposes.ivAlso contained in this report is a recommended process for identifying and periodically updating the set of data elements to be maintained by a school, school district, state educationagency, or other education unit with a need for student and staff information. This set of basic data elements does not include data elements more typically collected in sample surveys or those reflecting unique local and state activities. The purpose of these basic data elements is to provide a common language to promote the collection and reporting of comparable education data to guide policy and assist in the administration of state and localeducation systems.vAcknowledgments Leadership for this project was provided by a task force consisting of representatives from state, regional, and national education agencies and associations. The persons who served on thetask force for one or more years include Thomas Soltys (Delaware), Chair from April 1994 toApril 1995; Dori Nielson (Montana), Chair beginning in May 1995; Ken Adler (Wisconsin); Matthew Cohen (Ohio); Lynn Cornett (Southern Education Board, Georgia);Lavan (Arizona); andJudith Thompson (Connecticut). Participating from the National Center for Education Statisticswere Carol Sue Fromboluti, Lee Hoffman and Mary Rollefson. Providing assistance to the taskforce were Barbara Clements, Carol Lam, and Tom Szuba of the Council of Chief State SchoolOfficers. The task force is indebted to the numerous local, state, and national education agency and professional organization representatives who served on focus groups, reviewed the draftdocuments, and participated in round table discussions. Their comments on the feasibility ofimplementing such a set of basic data elements are especially appreciated.viiTable of Contents Foreword ............................................................................................................................... ........iii Acknowledgments ..........................................................................................................................v Section I Executive Summary ..............................................................................................I-1 Section II Introduction .........................................................................................................II-1 The Role of the Basic Data Elements...................................................................II-2 Definitions of Data Elements and Indicators........................................................II-3The Selection of the Basic Data Elements............................................................II-3Contents of This Report........................................................................................II-5 Section III A Process for Selecting Basic Data Elements .................................................III-1 Step 1:Identify Information Needs......................................................................III-1 Step 2:Identify and Define Data Elements That Generate the Information Needed.....................................................................................................III-3 Step 3:Examine the Quality of Data Elements Using the Six Selection Criteria.....................................................................................................III-3 Step 4:Check the Efficiency of the Collective Body of Data Elements..............III-3Step 5:Update Periodically the Set of Data Elements to Reflect Changes in Information Needs such as Reporting Requirements orEducation Goals-Conditions....................................................................III-3 Section IV Implementing the Basic Data Elements ...........................................................IV-1 1.

Using these basic data elements will provide more comparable and reliable education information for any educational system adopting the commonterminology. It will also reduce redundancy and alleviate burden on data collectors andproviders. What Are The Basic Data Elements? The basic data elements are building blocks for an education information system. The implementation of these basic data elements can provide data for: \u0001 education policy and decisionmaking for elementary and secondary education; \u0001 the understanding, operation, management, and improvement of local and state education systems and federal education programs; and \u0001 comparable statistics at the school, district, state, and national levels. The basic data elements included in this report will not meet every education information purpose. Although this report captures many of the data elements that are needed for state andfederal reporting, additional review of federal reporting data elements will be continued by theForum on Education Statistics, taking into account the changing data requests from the federalgovernment. In addition, state and local data collectors must examine and incorporate those dataelements that are critical for state and local reporting purposes. Policy Questions, Indicators, and Basic Data Elements How well are our children learning? What is the cost of public education? Do all students have the same opportunities to study challenging subject matter? Do students in theU.S. learn as much as their counterparts in other countries? People who have tried to monitor the progress of students in their school systems or compare their education systems with another know that simple answers are hard to find. Howdo we know the exact content covered in a course? Do the names given to staff positions indifferent parts of the country have enough consistency to know what they really do? Withvariations in terms, how can a district compare its students, staff, services, programs\u2014not tomention its effectiveness-with those in another district?I-2The most important use of this set of basic data elements is to help schools address the needs of students. When these data elements are maintained at the school or district level theycan provide information for teachers to monitor student needs, parents to become aware of theirchildren's performance and principals to make better decisions regarding their schools and toensure that students have qualified teachers and administrators. More comparable informationenables state and local government leaders and the public to gauge the effectiveness of schoolsand how education dollars are being spent. How To Use The Set of Basic Data Elements A set of basic data elements should provide the means to answer the most frequently asked questions about the administration, status, quality, operation and performance of schools andschool systems. But comparable, reliable, valid, measurable, and regularly collected data havenot been available to do so. This report is a first step to accomplish this task. The report contains \u0001 a process for selecting and including new data elements into an information system, making it more comprehensive and dynamic; and \u0001 student and staff data elements that can be used to create information for - conducting the day-to-day administration of schools and school districts; - completing federal and state reports; and - creating indicators that address questions about the success and functioning of education systems. Future Directions The information needs of education systems are constantly changing and education information systems must be modified to meet those needs. This report contains a process for identifying the data needed to accommodate these changes. Using the established criteria, items can be added and deleted over time. Moreover,school systems can use the elements that are locally relevant and add their own items tocomplement the set. The intent of this report is to assist in data collection and to facilitate thesharing of information through commonly agreed upon definitions.Section II IntroductionII-1Section II Introduction Policy makers at all levels of the education system in the United States recognize the need for comparable and complete information about public education. The lack of high quality data,described in A Nation at Risk in 1983, is even more critical in this era of reform and greater school accountability. The solution to our data needs must balance the desire for a greateramount of local flexibility and freedom from regulations with the need to accurately monitor theprogress of the students served with public funds. Governors, state legislators, other state andlocal policymakers, and the public want the capability to evaluate their schools by comparingthem to schools in other states and nations. Such comparisons, however, are problematic if theinformation is not collected using comparable definitions, procedures, and time schedules. In the United States, the public education system is decentralized. As a general rule, schools, school districts, and state education agencies collect education data for their ownplanning and operational needs. Most states do not share the same data requirements or systemsfor collecting and reporting data. In order for American education at all levels to operateeffectively and continue to improve, a coordinated data system comprised of comparable andcomprehensive information first must be established. In recent years, the leadership for identifying and promoting \"best practices\" in the area of education data collection has come from the National Forum on Education Statistics, whichconsists of representatives from state education agencies, the U.S. Department of Education(especially the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)), and professional educationassociations. The Forum, established by the National Center for Education Statistics in 1989 toassist with the implementation of Public Law 100-297 (the Hawkins-Stafford EducationImprovement Amendments), has established various task forces to focus on issues related to datapolicy and cooperative data improvement at all levels of education governance. This report presents the recommendations of one such task force. This document contains a set of recommended basic data elements that, if maintained at the school, district, and state levels in a standard format, will inform key decisionmakers charged with the responsibility forensuring that schools meet the education-related needs of children. The focus of this report is on early childhood, elementary and secondary education. The set of basic data elements reflects data needed for education-related activities. The set does not contain data elements on social services received by children or on juvenile detention activities. Data maintenance and reporting requirements in these areas vary considerably from site to site;therefore they were not included in the set.II-2The basic data elements included in this document will not meet every education information purpose. Although this document does capture many of the data elements that areneeded for state and federal reporting, additional review of federal reporting data elements willbe continued by the National Forum on Education Statistics, taking into account the changingdata requests from the federal government. In addition, state and local data collectors mustexamine and incorporate those data elements that are critical for state and local reportingpurposes. The data elements included in this report were selected, in part, because they can provide answers to current key questions about the status, quality, and performance of the educationsystem. Questions change over time. In addition, there are changes in data needs for reportingand for managing an education system. Thus, this report includes a process for identifyingadditional basic data elements as existing data systems are updated, or new ones established. The National Forum on Education Statistics presents this report as a tool to guide state and local school systems in selecting the basic data elements that logically comprise an informationsystem. These basic data elements can be used whether in a paper-based or computerized system or a combination of these media. Use of these recommendations is voluntary and the report doesnot imply that all of the listed data elements should be maintained by any agency. Eacheducation agency must determine the extent to which specific data are needed. The Role of the Basic Data Elements The basic data elements are building blocks that can be used to create comparable education information at all levels of the school system. The most important use of thisinformation is to help schools address the needs of students. Ideally, maintaining acomprehensive set of basic data elements (such as the set included in this report) at the school ordistrict level provides the information needed for teachers to monitor student needs, parents tobecome aware of their children's performance, and principals to monitor students' performanceand ensure that students have qualified teachers. Superintendents, boards of education, and thepublic can use the information to monitor the effectiveness of the school system and to knowwhere education dollars are spent. Many of these basic data elements already exist in school, school district, or state education agency data systems. However, they are often defined differently from site to site andfrom year to year. In addition, these data elements may be maintained in more than one placewithin a school or school district using different definitions or collected on systems that cannotbe linked. This report promotes the use of a common vocabulary, which will increasecomparability, reduce redundant data collection, and promote communication acrossjurisdictions.II-3Much information on students and staff relates to courses/classes, and this information is often kept in a school's information file, rather than in an individual student or staff member'sfile. At the time this list was identified, the task force did not address what data should be keptin a school file; however, consideration was given to what information must be maintained abouta student or staff member and go with the person when transferring schools or employment. Definitions of Data Elements and Indicators Data elements are the basic units, or fields, in a database. Data elements can provide information about many entities: students, teachers, schools, and others. On a paper form orquestionnaire, data elements are the individual blanks that must be completed. Some data elements describe characteristics that rarely or never change, such as a student's name or date of birth. Other data elements, such as a student's grade assignment or a teacher'syears of experience, reflect conditions that change over time. There is also a distinction between simple data elements that cannot be broken down into component information (gender, for example) and data elements that are aggregated or computedfrom others. Examples of the latter are a student's grade point average or a school's averagedaily attendance. The set of basic data elements includes both stable and changing information, and computed as well as simple data elements. Indicators are data elements, or combinations of data elements, that provide information about the status of the education system. They are measures of \"health\" or progress in a system. Student assessment results answer questions about whether student performance is improving. Statistics on the number of discipline incidents at a school can address whether or not schools aresafer than they were a decade ago. The indicators discussed in this report are typically aggregate counts (such as the number of students with Individualized Education Programs or IEPs) or computed rates (percentage ofstudents dropping out). The indicators used to identify elements for inclusion in the set of basic data elements do not refer to individual students or staff members, but are derived from individual records. For example, the number of students taking advanced placement (AP)courses is an indicator of school quality that is created from data about individual students. Adatabase may contain indicators as data elements, or the components for indicators can bemaintained in individual records, allowing the indicators to be computed when they are needed. The Selection of the Set of Basic Data Elements The set of basic data elements contained in this report was selected by education professionals at the local, state and national levels as essential to the operation, management, andimprovement of local and state education systems and to the development of education policy atall levels. The first release of this report contains data elements related to student and staffII-4members, particularly teachers. Data elements on school finance and facilities (and other identified areas) will be included in subsequent releases. Several assumptions were made by the task force overseeing this project during the selection of the basic data elements . 1. Individual student and staff administrative records are maintained for administrative reasons at the school or district level and contain most of the basic data elements. 2. The selected data elements may reflect data collected on subgroups of students and maintained in specialized records systems. 3. Using identified standard definitions, formats, and collection procedures for the data elements (such as those from the Student Data Handbook1 and the Staff Data Handbook2) enables data to be aggregated to provide comparable statistics at the school, district, state, and national levels. 4. The identified elements are applicable for data collection and reporting activities of both public and private education. The selection of the set of basic data elements involved a process similar to the one presented in Section III of this report. Three activ ities were completed by the task force. \u0001 Questions about the success and functioning of the schools were identified, followed by the selection of indicators that provide at least partial answers to those questions. Data elements needed to create the indicators were then identified. (See Appendix Afor the list of key questions and indicators identified by the Task Force.) \u0001 Student and staff data elements for completing reports to be submitted to federal agencies (and some state agencies) were identified. \u0001 Data elements needed for the day-to-day operations of schools and school districts were identified. Once the data elements were identified, the task force screened each of the basic data elements through criteria established at the beginning of this process. \u0001 The data element should be collected on a regular and timely basis. \u0001 The data element should be reliable. 1 Student Data Handbook: Elementary, Secondary and Early Childhood Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Washington, DC, 1994. 2 Staff Data Handbook: Elementary, Secondary and Early Childhood Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Washington, DC, 1995.II-5\u0001 The data element should be valid. \u0001 The data element should be quantifiable or measurable. \u0001 The data element has been consistently defined by a recognized body. \u0001 The set of data elements taken together provides for valid measures of desired indicators. Following the selection, various state and local educators were asked to review the set of basic data elements . Subsequent work will be done to analyze the feasibility of implementing the set by local and state education agencies, and to determine what types of assistance may beneeded to promote implementation and maintenance of comparable data across educationsystems. Contents of This Report This report provides two major types of information for use by the reader. First, Section III describes a process that can be used by local or state education agencies to identify the data needsof the agency and to select the data elements. This process can be used by an education agency orschool that is moving from paper records to automated records. It can also be used by thoseplanning to revise or update their systems. Section IV contains a description of how local and state education agencies can use this document to promote the maintenance of more comprehensive and comparable data for use indecisionmaking. The ideas contained in this section go beyond simply maintaining the set of basic data elements and include suggestions that support the development of a sound and useful information system. Sections V and VI contain the specific data elements identified for inclusion in the set of basic data elements . These data elements are presented as a \"first cut\" or starting point for establishing and revising data systems. It should be remembered that use of this set is voluntary. Furthermore, data requirements change, just as our ability to maintain data efficiently andsecurely changes. The set of basic data elements will need to be revised over time in response to emerging policy needs and innovations in information technology, just as an education agency'sset of data elements should be periodically reviewed and revised.Section III A Process for Selecting Basic Data ElementsIII-1Section III A Process for Selecting Basic Data Elements This section describes the steps that can be used in developing a set of basic data elements useful to a school, school district, or state education system. The process helps produceagreement on a set of basic data elements, which in turn can reduce costly data collectionredundancy, lessen the data reporting burden on respondents, and increase data comparabilityacross systems. Though not all education systems share the same requirements or needs forcollecting and reporting data, there is considerable commonality in education goals, objectives,and services across all levels and regions of the United States. When common definitions andformats are used for the data elements, aggregate data will provide comparable statistics at theschool, district, state, and national levels. The steps of this process are illustrated in figure III-(A). These steps can be used to identify a basic set of data elements for an education data system that will meet various needs. Step 1 Identify Information Needs Information is not without cost, and no data element should be collected unless a clear and specific need for it has been identified. All relevant parties\u2014policy makers and other data users,potential providers, and data system specialists\u2014should be included in the process of selectingdata elements for a data system. The process should begin with an examination on a wide rangeof information needs. Three major areas for which education information is needed are: programadministration, state and federal legislative and program reporting mandates, accountability, andpolicy planning. (a) Identify information needed to administer programs In general, schools, school districts, and state education agencies collect education data to meet their own planning and operational needs. For instance, principals need data about thenumber of students enrolled by grade level to plan for appropriate staffing and services. (b) Identify state and federal legislative and program reporting mandates A basic set of data elements should be applicable to the data collection and reporting responsibilities of the education system. For example, if the state legislature requires a report ofthe number of students participating in state-funded programs for gifted and talented students,then such information must be included in a school or school district database.III-2Figure III-(A).\u2014A process for selecting basic data elements Step 2Identify and define data elements that comprise the information needed.Step 2Identify and define data elements that comprisethe information needed.

Step 5 Update periodically the basic data set to reflect changes in information needs such as reporting requirements or education goals\u2014conditions.Step 5Update periodically the basic data set to reflect changes in information needs such as reporting requirements or education goals\u2014conditions.Step 1 Identify information needs (a) Identify informationneeded toadminister(b) Identify state and federal legislative and program reporting mandates(c) Identify key questions or indicators oneducationconditionsIII-3(c) Identify key questions or indicators on education conditions Questions should be identified that are central to administrative or policy needs, help to monitor educational outcomes, and lead to formulation of effective education policies. Indicatorsthat answer key questions concerning education conditions should also be identified. Forexample, student retention rates, together with students' attendance patterns, suspension andexpulsion rates, and mobility rate, are indicators for answering the question \"Are students inschool, that is, what are the patterns of participation in school activities?\" Step 2 Identify and Define Data Elements that Generate the Information Needed This step calls for identifying and defining specific data elements to provide the needed information. For instance, individual student's enrollment status, entry date, entry level, andexit/withdrawal date are data elements needed to generate the information concerning the numberof students enrolled by grade level. Step 3 Examine the Quality of Data Elements Using the Six Selection Criteria The data elements identified are to be screened by the six selection criteria for technical quality and feasibility. (See exhibit III-(I)) Step 4 Check the Efficiency of the Collective Body of Data Elements Review the efficiency of the overall set of chosen data elements. When taken as a whole, does the basic set of data elements provide a net savings in data collection and reporting effortsor a net gain in availability and utility of information? For example, student's entry level doesnot need to be collected separately to calculate both the \"student enrollment by grade level\" and\"student retention rate by grade level.\" Step 5 Update Periodically the Set of Data Elements to Reflect Changes in Information Needs Such as Reporting Requirements or Education Goals-Conditions The set of data elements should be dynamic. As policymakers move in new directions, new information about the education system will be needed. A set of data elements should beupdated periodically to ensure that it meets the information needs of the education system.III-4A school, district, or state education agency (SEA) could use this process to select the data elements to be included in a student information system. A SEA could also use this process toidentify what aggregate or computed data are needed from schools or school districts. The SEAcould then work with the schools and districts to ensure that the data elements have uniformdefinitions and the data are obtained using comparable collection procedures.Exhibit III(I).\u2014Criteria for evaluating the quality of data elements 1. The data element should be collected on a regular and timely basis. The data element should be one that is gathered and used on a regular basis. There is no efficiency in standardizing anelement that reflects a one-time need or an unusual bit of information. In addition, the collectionof this data element should occur at a time that is appropriate for the intended users. 2. The data element should be reliable. The data should be a consistent measure for every entity (such as individuals, schools, or districts) and from one time to another. 3. The data element should be valid. The data should measure what they purport to measure. A data element should reflect a logical and meaningful description of an entity, for example, anindividual, a school, or school district, and it should not be easily subject to distortion. 4. The data element should be quantifiable or measurable. The data to be collected can be defined, listed, codified, or otherwise described in a consistent, readily interpretable manner. 5. The data element has been consistently defined by a recognized body. The data element should have a standardized definition so that data can be collected in a reliable manner. Thisdefinition should be one that is available from a legitimate professional source and is generallyaccepted by the field as appropriate. 6. The data elements together provide for valid measures of desired indicators. Desired indicators include measures of student or institutional performance, equity, and efficiency.Section IV Implementing the Basic Data ElementsIV-1Section IV Implementing the Basic Data Elements Adopting the contents of this report (or adapting it to local conditions) should increase the capacity of an education agency or school to respond to the questions of educators, thecommunity, and parents about the functioning and effectiveness of schools. However,implementation requires the commitment of all those involved in providing, collecting,maintaining, reporting, and using the data. In this section are some general activitiesincorporating the set of basic data elements that state education agencies can use to support the development of a more effective information system at the state and local levels. 1. Adopt the Process for Selecting Basic Data Elements. The process described in Section III of this report provides for varying perspectives to be included in the selection of data elements needed for an information system. Allowing forconsiderable participation in the identification process can help to reassure participants that theirperspectives are being taken into consideration and to build the commitment of participants to thefinal product. For instance, state education agencies (SEAs) could bring together representativesof schools and districts within the state to discuss information needs and ways to collect andrecord the information. If a SEA intends to collect individual student or staff data, district andschool personnel should help to decide what data elements should be collected, when they shouldbe collected, how the data elements should be defined, and how the data will be used. If a SEAdoes not intend to collect individual student or staff level data but wants to improve thecomparability of data it collects in the aggregate, it could use the process to work with school anddistrict personnel to develop a consensus on what data must be collected by all schools anddistricts within the state and what definitions and collection procedures should be used by all. 2. Incorporate the Process into All Data Planning and Development Activities. SEAs can use this report to review the contents of their existing information systems and the processes used to collect, analyze, and report data to education decisionmakers and thepublic. Data elements may be dropped from existing systems because they do not meet thecriteria described in the review process. SEAs can look at where there is redundant andconflicting data collection, and bring data collectors and users together to ensure that datacollection is done more efficiently and effectively. SEA staff can provide feedback to legislatorson what data are available, and what it would take to get additional data to meet legislative needsfor information. SEA staff can then review and select new software and hardware in light ofinformation needs after they have completed the selection process.IV-2Data obtained through a more coordinated and efficient information system should be more useful, and the state should have better information for making decisions about such issues asmerging districts, building new schools, and revising school or program structures. 3. Use the Contents of This Report To Encourage Schools and Districts To Provide Better Quality Data. SEAs that adopt Basic Data Elements from this report along with the definitions and selection process can use this report to help evaluate the quality of the data provided by schoolsand districts and encourage districts to adopt more comparable data sets. For instance, SEAs canreturn data to schools and districts if they do not comply with the definitions and collectionprocedures specified by the state. SEAs can use the comparable data from schools and districtsto inform the public. Schools and districts that do not comply with data collection and reportingrequirements would not be included. 4. Provide Training and Support For Schools and Districts To Use the Contents Of This Report. Many SEAs meet regularly with SEA, local education agency (LEA), and school personnel responsible for collecting, reporting, and using data. These gatherings provide an excellentopportunity for local educators to learn what is desired by the SEA and where they might not bemeeting reporting requirements. SEA personnel benefit from these meetings because they canlearn what problems local educators are having in the collection and reporting of data, providetraining and technical assistance, and build commitment to the provision of better quality data. SEA personnel can use the contents of this report to provide training to school and districtpersonnel about how to make their information systems more effective and efficient. Forinstance, in their training materials, SEAs may include specific examples to illustrate the processof selecting basic data elements (Figure B on page 22) and to show how the six selection criteriacan be used to evaluate the quality of data elements (Exhibit 2 on pages 23-25). SEAs canidentify which Basic Data Elements they consider most essential, provide definitions for the data elements, and describe data collection procedures to ensure that schools and districts areproviding comparable data. 5. Advertise Compelling Reasons for Districts And Schools To Use This Report. State education agencies should share the contents of this report with schools and school districts, since educators at those levels also need to develop information systems to answerimportant questions of educators, the community and parents. Schools and districts are heldaccountable for the performance of their students. Local ability to address accountability issuesdepends on having good quality data available; therefore the process proposed in this report andIV-3the data elements recommended for inclusion in a data system can help schools and districts to ensure that needed data are available, interpretable, and useful. Schools and districts can use the process and data element definitions included in this report whether or not their information systems are automated. These guidelines are relevant topaper-based systems as well as automated systems. Schools and districts with paper-basedinformation systems can use this report when they review how they are currently collecting datato make improvements, and the guidelines can help them make changes that will position themfor movement to automated information systems in the future. An information system designed using the guidelines included in this report can result in a reduction in data burden and data duplication as well as improve the quality and availability ofthe data. The use of common data elements across school sites will allow for information to becompared so that outstanding programs or programs in need of assistance can be identified. Schools and districts with similar characteristics can be encouraged to share ideas that work withtheir students. This report captures many of the data elements that are needed for state and federal reporting. However, additional review of federal reporting data elements will be continued bythe National Forum on Education Statistics, taking into account the changing data requests fromthe federal government. In addition, state and local education agencies must examine andincorporate those elements that are critical for state and local reporting purposes. 6. Work With State and Local Software Vendors To Incorporate the Basic Data Elements and Their Definitions. State and local education agencies can use this report to assist them as they review the contents of various administrative software programs to see if the Basic Data Elements are included. In addition, the process can help educators at all levels of the education system toencourage software vendors to provide products that meet the various analysis and reportingneeds of schools and districts. By promoting the inclusion of the data elements as they aredefined in this report, education agencies can ensure that the formats used will provide flexibilityand address data collection issues in ways that will meet educators' information needs in thefuture. Conclusion There are many ways in which state education agencies can work with schools and school districts to improve the collection and use of high quality data. This report addresses issuesrelated to the selection of data elements to include in an information system that providesinformation for administering the schools, providing instructional services to students,monitoring the quality and progress of the education system, and completing reportingrequirements. Through a collaborative process for reaching agreement on the inclusion of dataelements in an information system, such as is described in this report, states can buildIV-4commitment to the availability of high quality, useful data on schools. In addition, education systems can adjust to changing data needs as they promote improvement in the provision ofservices to students.IV-5Figure IV-(A).\u2014A process for selecting basic data elements, illustrated with specific examples 2 Identify data elements (DEs) that comprise the information needed: DE's Enrollment Status; DE's: Individualized Date; Level; Nonpromotion Reason Exit/Withdrawal Date and data elements: Data No1.: Data 080; 083; data comprise the information needed: DE's Enrollment Status; DE's: Individualized Date; Level; Nonpromotion Reason Exit/Withdrawal Date and data elements: Data No1.: Data 083; 158 073; 080; 083; 104 3 Examine the quality of data elements using the six selection criteria: (i) The data elements should be collected on a regular and timely basis; (ii) The data elements should be reliable; (iii) The data elements should be valid; (iv) The data elements should be quantifiable or measurable; (v) The data elements have been consistently defined by a recognized body, such as the Student Data Handbook2; (vi) The data elements selected in Step 2 provide for valid measures of desired indicators listed in Step 1.3 Examine the quality of data elements using the six selection criteria: (i) The data elements should be collected on a regular and timely basis; (ii) The data elements should be reliable; (iii) The data elements should be valid; (iv) The data elements should be quantifiable or measurable; (v) The data elements have been consistently defined by a recognized body, such as the Student Data Handbook2; (vi) The data elements selected in Step 2 provide for valid measures of desired indicators listed in Step 1. 4 Check the efficiency of the collective body of data elements: To reduce redundancy, the overall set of data elements needs only one data element for student's \"Entry Level,\" though the data element is needed to calculate both the \"student enrollment by grade level\" and \"the student retention by grade level.\" The overall set of data elements would be: \"Enrollment status, Entry Date, Entry level, Exit/Withdrawal Date, Individualized Program Type, and Nonpromotion Reason.\" These data elements are defined at the individual student level from where non-personally identifiable information could be aggregated for local, state, and federal program administration, required reporting, and education condition indication.4 Check the efficiency of the collective body of data elements: To reduce redundancy, the overall set of data elements needs only one data element for student's \"Entry Level,\" though the data element is needed to calculate both the \"student enrollment by grade level\" and \"the student retention by grade level.\" The overall set of data elements would be: \"Enrollment status, Entry Date, Entry level, Exit/Withdrawal Date, Individualized Program Type, and Nonpromotion Reason.\" These data elements are defined at the individual student level from where non-personally identifiable information could be aggregated for local, state, and federal program administration, required reporting, and education condition indication. 5 Update periodically the basic data set to reflect changes in information needs such as reporting requirements or education goals\u2014conditions.5 Update periodically the basic data set to reflect changes in information needs such as reporting requirements or education goals\u2014conditions.1 Identify information needs: (a) Identify information needed to administer programs: E.g., Number of Students enrolled by Grade Level(b) Identify state and federal legislative and program reporting mandates: E.g., Number of Students Participating in Individualized Education Program(c) Identify key questions or indicators on education conditions: E.g., Student Retention Rate by Grade Level 1 As used in the Student Data Handbook: Elementary, Secondary and Early Childhood Education , National Center for Education Statistics, 1994, Washington, DC. 2 Ibid.IV-6Exhibit IV-(I).\u2014Criteria for evaluating the quality of data elements, illustrated with examples The six criteria for evaluating data elements are illustrated by examples of data elements possibly meeting or not meeting the criteria. 1. The data element should be collected on a regular and timely basis. The data element should be one that is gathered and used on a regular basis. There is no efficiency instandardizing an element that reflects a one-time need or an unusual bit of information. Inaddition, the collection of this data element should occur at a time that is appropriate for theintended users. Example: Student enrollment \u0001Data elements such as Exit/Withdrawal Date and Exit/Withdrawal Type (e.g., transfer, graduation, illness, expulsion, dropping out) are maintainedthroughout each school year. These data can beaggregated at the end of a school year for reporting tothe district or state.\u0002Occasionally, there are one-time collections of dataon particular activities of interests. These dataelements, however, might not be considered basic inindividual student or staff record systems. An example of such data elements would be number of hours students report watching television . 2. The data element should be reliable. The data should be a consistent measure for every entity (such as individuals, schools, or districts) and from one time to another. Example: Student learning \u0001Student's attendance status in a class provides reliable information about student's presence at orabsence from each class period while school is insession. Compilation of these data results in totaltime spent in the class.\u0002Information on time spent on homework or relevant educational activities outside of school is most likely obtained through surveys to parents. Data of this kind tend to be subjective in nature. Thisparticular data element does not provide a consistentmeasure for every student.IV-73. The data element should be valid. The data should measure what they purport to measure. A data element should reflect a logical and meaningful description of an entity, forexample, an individual, a school, or school district, and it should not be easily subject todistortion. Example: Teacher qualification \u0001A valid data element to reflect whether an individual is authorized to teach a certain subject is the Teaching field or area authorized by an active teaching credential that the individual holds.\u0002Time spent in past school year teaching a particular subject matter area does not specify whether the individual is authorized to teach a certainsubject-matter area. 4. The data element should be quantifiable or measurable. The data to be collected can be defined, listed, codified, or otherwise described in a consistent, readily interpretable manner. Example: Professional development activities \u0001Number of Credits Earned by an individual who completes a course or activity could be a quantifiableand measurable data element for a staff record. (Another data element on the type of credits or units of value awarded for the completion of a course maybe needed to specify whether the number of creditsearned refers to college credit, Continuing EducationUnits, or other types of credits.)\u0002Quality of a professional development activity is difficult to measure. There are still no data onprofessional development activities that arecomparable across states. 5. The data element has been consistently defined by a recognized body. The data element should have a standardized definition so that data can be collected in a reliable manner. This definition should be one that is available from a legitimate professional source and isgenerally accepted by the field as appropriate. Example: Uses of technology in schools \u0001In general, all data elements listed in NCES' Student and Staff Data Handbooks can meet this particular criterion. The definition of the data element Principal Medium of Instruction can be found in the Student Data Handbook . Listed options of this data element include computer-based instruction,distance learning, and interactivetelecommunications.\u0002On the other hand, consistent definitions concerning students' access to the Internet or computers in schools are yet to be established.IV-86. The data elements together provide for valid measures of desired indicators. Desired indicators include measures of student or institutional performance, equity, and efficiency. Example: Student achievement information \u0001\"Average subject area proficiencies by grade level\" is an indicator of how well students do on state or localtests. Here a list of six data elements may be neededto provide the information for this indicator. They are: assessment content (e.g., arts, math, a foreign language), subtest type (e.g., reading comprehension, vocabulary), grade level when assessed , administration date , score results , and reporting method (the measure in which results are presented, e.g., letter grade, normal curve equivalent, percentilerank, pass-fail).\u0002Given the same indicator, if any one of these sixindicators is missing, there might not be sufficientinformation for answering what the average subjectarea proficiencies by grade level are. For example, if the data element grade level when assessed was missing, we would not know which grade level thestudent was in when he or she took the tests. As aresult, we may be able to know what the averagesubject area proficiencies are, but we may not be ableto know them by grade level of students who havetaken the tests.Section V Basic Data Elements for Student Information SystemsV-1Section V Basic Data Elements for Student Information Systems This section contains a listing of the basic data elements identified for inclusion in student information systems. These data elements represent essential information about students thatcould be maintained at a school or district level by teachers or others with whom the studentcomes in contact. Definitions for the basic data elements are provided to promote comparability in data collection and maintenance in a paper-based or electronic information system. If thesedata elements were part of a student record system, they would provide information for: \u0001 making day-to-day decisions about the provision of appropriate instruction and services to students; \u0001 determining and acting on operational needs of schools and districts for students; and \u0001 completing most reports required by local, state, and federal education agencies. All of the data elements selected were assumed to be needed and, therefore, maintained at the school or school district level. Thus, school or district personnel should review the set of basic data elements to determine if the data elements fit their information needs. Some of the data elements may not be needed because of the level of the students or other characteristics ofthe school or students. It is expected that additional data elements beyond this set will be neededto meet local needs. The set of basic data elements is presented as a set that should be consistent across school sites and districts in order to provide important information for decisionmaking atthe local and state levels. Some states choose to maintain individual student records at the state level, and many of the data elements in this set are included in state-level databases. However, it is notrecommended that all of the basic data elements be maintained at all levels of an education system. It is important for a state education agency to determine whether it needs to collectindividual student data, and if so, what specific data elements should be maintained. Considerations When Selecting Data Elements The set of basic data elements for student information systems includes some data elements that do not need to be maintained about all students. For federal and state reporting,schools and districts must maintain data about student participation in state or federally fundedprograms. Not all students participate in these programs, therefore, program participation datawill not be needed for all students. For example, data on Individualized Education Programs(IEPs) should only be maintained for those students participating in special education programsrequiring IEPs.V-2Not all data must be maintained in the same paper file or computer file. Some data elements about a student may be maintained in a separate filing cabinet or computer. In order forthe data to be maximally useful, however, the data should have a unique identifier for a studentthat can be linked with data on that student maintained in another file or computer. In addition,such a system of linked files can reduce data redundancy and burden by recording theinformation once in a system that can be accessed by all those who need it. This is particularlytrue with computerized information systems. By maintaining the data elements in a singlelocation, there is a higher probability that data will be comparable, and not recorded withdifferent definitions and formats. The basic data elements included in this section were taken from the Student Data Handbook on Elementary, Secondary, and Early Childhood Education , developed by the National Center for Education Statistics. The Student Data Handbook contains a comprehensive listing of data elements that could be kept in a student information system. A major focus of thishandbook is on standardizing data element formats for computer systems. The data elementsreflect a consensus of persons in education as to the best and most flexible way to maintainstudent data. The data elements in the handbook are recommended, not mandatory. It isunderstood that many student records currently may not use the definitions or the exact formatsincluded in the handbook. For instance, the handbook recommends the use of individual dataelements for the various components of a student's name. In the basic data elements , four of those data elements for \"name\" were considered essential: First Name, Middle Name,Last/Surname, and Generation Code. Some schools, districts or state education agencies maychoose to have a single data element for a student's name, rather than four. The use of four dataelements provides more flexibility in a data system; however, is not necessarily essential forcomparable data. In identifying the set of basic data elements there was a special focus on the need for comparability in how data are collected and reported. Users of this report may chooseother data elements than those included in this recommended set; however, they should besensitive to those data elements for which comparability is essential. Student Data Elements Included in the following are lists of: \u0001 Basic Data Elements for student information systems; and \u0001 definition of the Basic Data Elements for student information systems.

(FEDERAL AGENCY: Office of Elementary and Secondary Education,Department of Education)Section VI Basic Data Elements for Staff Information SystemsVI-1Section VI Basic Data Elements for Staff Information Systems This section contains a listing of the basic data elements identified as essential for inclusion in staff information systems. These data elements can provide information for determining staffassignments, monitoring issues related to staff quality, completing local, state and federal reports,and other activities related to staff development and evaluation. They also can helpdecisionmakers answer essential questions about the functioning of the school system. The focus of these data elements is on teachers, teaching aides, principals, and other staff members with a direct instructional or service relationship with students. Much of the selectionprocess for this group of basic data elements focused on the development of indicators related to the effective provision of classroom services to students. Data about staff members are often maintained in different paper or computer files. The level of detail maintained depends on where the data are maintained and how they are used. Datamay be kept in a licensure/certification file, a personnel assignment file, a payroll file, aretirement file, and perhaps others. As with student data, flexibility and usefulness depend on theextent to which data about a single staff member can be compiled from the various sources usinga single identifier. Similar to the basic data elements for student information systems, these data elements and their definitions and formats were taken from the Staff Data Handbook for Elementary, Secondary, and Early Childhood Education , developed by the National Center for Education Statistics. This information represents the consensus of many educators as to the most effectiveway to maintain desired types of information about all staff within education systems. As withthe student data, not all data elements must be collected about every staff member, while in somecases to do so would be inappropriate. Considerations When Selecting Data Elements The set of basic data elements for staff information systems includes data elements about the staff member's characteristics, educational background, qualifications, current employment,assignments, evaluation and separation from employment. All of these are considered importantfor maintaining records on teachers and others responsible for providing instruction and servicesto students. Some of the data elements reflect new ways to record data on professional training, experience, and evaluation. Similarly, the Staff Data Handbook is structured to promote maintenance of information about staff members over time, an approach that differs from thecommon practice of letting new data replace old. Users of this report should consider thesechanges in what information on staff members may be needed, and how they can best record theinformation.VI-2Staff Data Elements Included in the following are lists of: \u0001 Basic Data Elements for staff information systems; and \u0001 definition of the Basic Data Elements for staff information systems. Data element numbers and definitions used in the lists are taken from NCES' Staff Data Handbook: Elementary, Secondary and Early Childhood Education .

Data ElementsA-1Appendix A Policy Questions, Indicators, and Basic Data Elements A set of basic data elements should provide the means to answer the most basic and most frequently asked questions concerning the status, quality, and functioning of schools and schoolsystems. In the Forum's 1990 report, A Guide to Improving the National Education Data System , the nature and adequacy of national data were examined in four major domains: background/demographics , education resources , school processes , and student outcomes . The Task Force discussed questions under each of the four major domains for which informationis frequently requested. These questions primarily reflect policy decisions that affect studentachievement. The Task Force has chosen indicators that can be obtained through a well-designedadministrative records system. These indicators represent a consensus on what is the research-supported evidence that can be used to monitor and improve the quality of educational services provided to children. (See exhibit A-I ) Indicators that are unique to specific school or district policies are not included in this list, nor are data acquired only through surveys or researchstudies. Examples of indicators not included in this document are graduation requirements,students' aspirations for further education, and attendance and suspension policies.A-2Exhibit A-(I) Key Questions and Indicators in Four Major Domains of Education Information Student and Community Background Statistics /G01 Are children ready to learn when they enter school? /G01 Percentage of children entering school with limited or no English proficiency /G01 Percentage of children who received different types of early childhood learning experiences /G01 Percentage of children with health needs /G01 Percentage of children by disability type /G01 What kind of outside support do students have? /G01 Percentage of students by parental education level /G01 Percentage of students by family structure School Process Statistics /G01 Do students have access to high quality, rigorous educational content and courses? /G01 Percentage of students enrolled by course title or program /G01 Are students in school? /G01 Mobility rate for students /G01 Student attendance rate /G01 Percentage of students suspended or expelled as a disciplinary action /G01 Number of criminal offenses reported by type /G01 Student retention rate by grade level /G01 What is the classroom or school environment? /G01 Percentage of students receiving special services (e.g., special education, ESL, Title I) /G01 Percentage of students by race/ethnicity by sex /G01 Percentage of teachers assigned to teach within their field of certification by subject area Education Resource Statistics /G01 What are the qualifications of instructional personnel? /G01 Average number of years of teacher experience /G01 What is the supply of qualified instructional personnel? /G01 Percentage of staff by race/ethnicity by sex /G01 Rate of staff turnover by instructional level by program or subject matter area /G01 What additional assistance is available for students, staff, and other personnel? /G01 Number of students by support service type /G01 Percentage of students receiving transportation (including contracted service arrangements) Student Outcomes Statistics /G01 Do students complete their schooling? /G01 Percentage of students receiving a regular high school or advanced high school diploma /G01 Percentage of students graduating with a certificate of completion /G01 Percentage of students who dropped out of school /G01 What did students learn? /G01 Percentage of students taking AP courses by subject area /G01 Average subject area proficiencies by grade level (e.g., state or local tests) /G01 Percentage of students meeting state and local achievement standards by school, family income, grade level, etc. /G01 Percentage of students taking specified core curricula (including 4 Math, 3 Science, 4 English, 3 Social Studies, 0.5 Computer) /G01 Are students prepared for further education? \u0001 Percentage of students taking college entrance examinationsA-3The Basic Set of Data Elements was derived, in part, from the list of indicators included in Table A, \" List of Key Policy Question Information Areas, Indicators and Constituent Data Elements .\" The Task Force has made assumptions concerning the availability of certain types of data. For example, it is assumed that total enrollment counts are available so that percentagescan be computed for most of the listed indicators. An indication of when students enrolled andwithdrew is needed so that total enrollment counts will be accurate for a given date or timeperiod. An important assumption is that basic demographic data about students are included inindividual student records, such as age (or date of birth), sex, race/ethnicity, and grade level. With these data elements, cross-tabulations can be computed for students by age, grade level,race/ethnicity or sex, or combinations of these variables at the school, district, or state levels. Student and Community Background Statistics Many factors affect student learning at schools. The physical and emotional well-being of young children influences their abilities to learn when they enter school. With parent and familysupport, a child gains the confidence to reach for his or her full potential to learn. In addition, aresourceful community can help families provide an environment conducive to student learning. Two major questions related to student and community background affect student learning: \u0001 Are children ready to learn when they enter school? A child must be physically, mentally, and linguistically ready to participate in various learning activities and to receive instructionin school. Young children cannot learn if they are hungry or physically weak due toinsufficient nourishment. They may have difficulties in adjusting to a school's learningenvironment if they have had limited previous learning experiences. Children who are notproficient in English may not be able to communicate well with other adults and children atschool. For schools to address these needs, they must be aware of them and plan for theprovision of educational services that will overcome these barriers to learning. The followingare indicators that provide information about the special needs of young children when theyenter school. Possible Indicators 1. Percentage of children entering school with limited or no English proficiency 2. Percentage of children who received different types of early childhood learning experiences 3. Percentage of children with health needs 4. Percentage of children by disability type \u0001 What kind of outside support do students have? What a student experiences outside of school greatly affects his or her learning in school. A student will have a better chance tosucceed when his or her parents place a major emphasis on learning. A student whose familycannot afford to buy a computer at home is less likely to gain as much computer experienceas another child whose family is fully equipped with a computer and a modem. Possible Indicators 1. Percentage of students by parental education level 2. Percentage of students by family structureA-4School Process Statistics As mentioned in A Guide to Improving the National Education Data System , school process measures are needed to describe instructional practice, monitor reform, and explaindiscrepancies in student performance. Questions related to school process measures areprimarily concerned with content and quality of instruction that students receive, students'participation in learning activities, and characteristics of the learning and teaching environment. Members of the Core Data Task Force suggest three major questions related to school process. \u0001 Do students have access to high-quality, rigorous educational content and courses? The types of courses offered indicate quality of education content available. All course offerings,including distance learning courses, should be examined. One way of assessing the quality ofcourses offered is to look at the graduation requirements. For instance, if completing twoyears of algebra is required, schools must make two algebra courses available. Thisrequirement could be an indication that students are required to complete rigorousmathematics courses. Schools may provide high-quality educational content and courses, butstudents actually spend relatively little time in core subject courses. A look at the course-taking pattern of students and the time spent in core academic courses would help inassessing the extent to which students are exposed to rigorous education. Possible Indicator 1. Percentage of students enrolled by course title or program \u0001 Are students in school? Answering this question requires examining students' attendance patterns, retention rates, suspension and expulsion rates, and attendance policies and theireffects on student learning. The mobility pattern of a student's family also affects his or herlearning and participation in school activities. This is especially true for those states (e.g.,California, Texas, and Florida) where large populations of migrant workers are reported. Inaddition, crime incidents and substance abuse have great effects on students' attendance andparticipation in school activities. Possible Indicators 1. Mobility rate for students 2. Student attendance rate3. Percentage of students suspended or expelled as a disciplinary action4. Number of criminal offenses reported by type5. Student retention rate by grade level \u0001 What is the classroom or school environment? This is a school process question covering all aspects of the school environment that might affect students' learning. Some examples offactors affecting the school environment include class size, effective use of technology,student and staff population characteristics, and instructional practices. Answers to thisquestion also include basic information about the school, such as school type; grade ranges;offering of special programs and services; and governance issues such as site-baseddecisionmaking, team teaching, and the provision of release time for professionaldevelopment activities.A-5Possible Indicators 1. Percentage of students receiving special services (e.g., special education, English as a Second Language (ESL), Title I) 2. Percentage of students by race/ethnicity by sex3. Percentage of teachers assigned to teach within their field of certification by subject area Education Resource Statistics The following three questions address major issues regarding education resources. Each question covers a wide spectrum of concerns, whereas the indicators point to some of the morespecific concerns for schools and educators. \u0001 What are the qualifications of instructional personnel? Many factors may affect a person's ability to teach. We may logically expect a person's education and training to have asignificant impact. Several indicators can be used to help identify a teacher's qualificationsto teach. Among these measures are preservice and inservice training experiences, licensuretesting, other types of professional development, and years of experience in the classroom. Possible Indicator 1. Average number of years of teacher experience \u0001 What is the supply of qualified instructional personnel? Measures in this area address the need to know who is teaching our nation's children. A snapshot of the distribution ofinstructional personnel will help us understand the educational experiences of children. These indicators address demographics, assignments, and attrition rates. Possible Indicators 1. Percentage of staff by race/ethnicity by sex 2. Rate of staff turnover by instructional level by program or subject matter area \u0001 What additional assistance is available for students, staff, and other personnel? In addition to instructional support for students, it is also important to assess what other formsof support are available to students and staff. For example, do students have access to alibrary, guidance counselors, psychologists, and health providers during school hours? Isthere administrative support for teachers? Other types of support include transportation andlunch programs, federally funded programs, and community resources. Possible Indicators 1. Number of students by support service type 2. Percentage of students receiving transportation (including contracted service arrangements)A-6Student Outcomes Statistics \"How are students doing?\" is the most important question asked by educators, parents, leaders of industry and business, and policymakers. Citizens are interested in knowing the resultsof the tax dollars they spend on education. Such concern focuses on the following key questions: \u0001 Do students complete their schooling? We need to know how many students graduate and how many of them drop out of schools. In addition, it would be helpful to know the types ofcredentials graduates hold, whether for entering the work force or receiving postsecondaryeducation. Possible Indicators 1. Percentage of students receiving a regular high school or advanced high school diploma 2. Percentage of students graduating with a certificate of completion3. Percentage of students completing high school equivalency requirements4. Percentage of students who dropped out of school \u0001 What did students learn? This is a key question that is asked by everyone\u2014parents, legislators, governors, and leaders of both the private and public sectors. We are concernedwith what our students know and how much they know in comparison to students in otherstates and countries. A series of questions can be asked to reflect what students learned inschools. For example, are high school students achieving high learning standards forchallenging courses? How many students are participating in AP courses? How many APstudents score high enough to get college credit for the course? Are students scoring high onstandardized achievement tests? How many courses and what types of courses are taken byhigh school students? Possible Indicators 1. Percentage of students taking AP courses by subject area 2. Average subject area proficiencies by grade level (e.g., state or local tests) 3. Percentage of students meeting state and local achievement standards by school, family income, grade level, etc. 4. Percentage of students taking specified core curriculums (including 4 Math, 3 Science, 4 English, 3 Social Studies, 0.5 Computer) \u0001 Are students prepared for further education? In this information age and global economy, more jobs require postsecondary education or training and skills beyond the high schoollevel. Several questions can be asked to reflect students' readiness for postsecondaryeducation. For example, how many students are going to postsecondary institutions aftergraduation? How many of them are taking college preparatory examinations, and what aretheir scores? Do students complete their postsecondary educations? Possible Indicators 1. Percentage of students taking college entrance examinationsA-7Table A.\u2014List of key questions, indicators, and constituent student/staff data elements Domain: Student and Community Background Statistics Key Data Element1Information Needed in Individual Student Questions Indicator No.Name Entity Uses or Staff Records to Compute the Indicator2 Are children ready to learnwhen they enterschool?Percent of children entering school with limited or noEnglish proficiency027 080English proficiency Entry dateStudent StudentEnglish proficiency level of a child at the time when that child enters school Percent of children who receiveddifferent types of earlychildhood learning experiences307 308311Caregiver/early childhood program provider Caregiver/early childhood program location Early childhood program sponsorshipProgram/Service Program/ServiceProgram/ServiceDifferent types of early childhood learning experiences include who took care of the child(parent/guardian, or relative, or non-relative),what the setting or location of the care/learningenvironment was (child's home, or a homeother than the child's, or school, or communityfacility other than school), and/or what type ofearly childhood program a child participated in(school sponsored program, or publiclysponsored program, or non-profit privatelysponsored program, or for-profit program 1 A data element is the lowest level of information contained in an individual student or staff record. For definitions of the \"data elements\" and \"entity uses\" listed in this table, please refer to Section V and VI of this report. For identification purposes, each data element is numbered according to the Student Data Handbook: Elementary, Secondary and Early Childhood Education (National Center for Education Statistics, 1994) and the Staff Data Handbook: Elementary, Secondary and Early Childhood Education (National Center for Education Statistics, 1995). A three-digit number is for a student data element, while staff data elements have a f our-digit numbering system. To assist the design of a record system, most of the data elements in the Handbooks are illustrated with recommended options of alternatives/responses for the data elements. For instance, the data element \"Race/Ethnicity\" has five general options for responding to an individual's racial or ethnic heritage category. 2 Indicators are often expressed in percentages, averages, and totals. It is assumed that total enrollment counts are available for computing percentages and averages. An indicator statistic is computed from compilations of individual data on a specific topic of concern/interest. A computed statistic for an indicator, therefore, should not contain individual identifiable information.A-8Key Data Element Information Needed in Individual Student Questions Indicator No.Name Entity Uses or Staff Records to Compute the Indicator Are children ready to learnwhen theyenter school?Percent of children with dateImmunization status codeEmergency factorStudent StudentStudentStudentSchool or teachers need to know whether a student has any physical or medical conditionof potential significance (e.g., allergy andasthma) during an emergency treatment.Another major area concerning children'shealth needs is whether a child has receivedthe recommended immunization as scheduled.
