We also revisitone 'old chestnut' - namely the rich vein of inno-vation that runs through our sector. Use of the word 'sustainability' in an emer- gency context always needs qualification andnuancing. Are we talking about sustainability ofcapacity, resources, demand for services, a prod-uct or institutional sustainability? In the mostacute crisis, where high levels of external inter-national support are needed immediately, itmay be really difficult to think about and imple-ment activities that can be sustained post-emer-gency. In slower onset crisis or chronic emergen-cies, it should be more feasible. However, thedonor environment may be such that with allthe will in the world, implementing agencies canonly undertake activities and projects withinpredefined time lines and budget cycles. Notonly does this mean that projects are imple-mented over too short a period to achievesustainable outcomes, but there is little under-standing or knowledge of how long theseoutcomes or achievements can be maintainedonce the 'externally' implemented interventionis over. A number of pieces in this issue relate to sustainability of interventions. The 2008Humanitarian Response Index (HRI) reportrecently published by DARA (see researchsection) confirms a perennial challenge in thehumanitarian sector - how better to link relief torecovery and long term development, andstrengthen the resilience of populationsaffected by crises. The report states that human-itarian agencies often struggle to find appropri-ate means to achieve a balance between meet-ing short term needs and laying the foundationfor recovery and development. The HRI findingsshow that some donor policies and procedurescan accentuate the gap between relief, recoveryand development, rather than facilitating moreintegrated and harmonised efforts. Similarly,donor procedures can facilitate or impedeefforts effectively to engage local communitiesin defining and implementing programmes thatmeet their needs. The field article written by Gwyneth Hogley Cotes describes efforts to scale up and integratecommunity therapeutic care (CTC) serviceswithin existing health services in Malawi. Theauthors describe numerous challenges and thekey role played by the CTC advisory service that,once established, provided the institutionalsupport and constancy necessary to ensure adegree of success. A Food and AgriculturalOrganisation (FAO) evaluation of the FoodSecurity Assessment Unit and NutritionInformation Project in Somalia found thatsustainability of the project (that is now in itsfifth phase) is vulnerable, given the substantialresources required to maintain the systems. Theevaluation concluded that an exit strategy isneeded that foresees the handover of at leastsome of the activities to local stakeholders in themid to long term. Recommendations for achiev-ing this include giving more voice to the differ-ent Somali actors in the project steeringcommittee, giving preference to partnershipwith Somali national or sub-national entitieseven if these are weak compared to interna-tional non-governmental organisations, andreducing costs as much as possible so that even-tual transfer is eased. Sustainability is also an important issue for the private sector. A field article by Nutrisetexplores their experience of 'social marketing' ofa ready to use micronutrient supplement inNiamey, Niger. Sale price must cover direct andFrom the Editor Contents indirect costs if the product is to be manufac- tured locally. Nutriset has financed the settingup of the distribution network, training and thelarge awareness communication campaign. Thisexpenditure has been vital for kick-starting theprocess - however it is not known whetherdemand can be sustained without this type ofexpenditure and whether private producers canabsorb these costs or will need to pass them ontothe urban poor who are the main target group. A news piece on the recent World Health Organisation expert collaboration on manage-ment of moderate malnutrition in childrenunder five years of age highlights the funda-mental issue of the affordability of new productscoming onto the market. While many of thesenew products may have considerable nutritionaladvantages compared to the types of fortifiedblended foods used in the past, their cost andtherefore the sustainability of their provision, isan unknown - especially in relation to govern-ment spending capacity and priorities. Similarissues apply to the role of ready to use therapeu-tic foods in community-based management ofacute malnutrition and scaling up theseprogrammes. It is notable that there has been nomodelling of least developed countries govern-ment capacities to support provision of thesetypes of product on a large scale over the longterm, or discussion of whether the internationalaid community would be prepared to subsidisesuch interventions indefinitely. While previous editorials have highlighted the importance of understanding market behav-iour from an early warning perspective, we havenever turned the spotlight on the role of themarket in creating nutritional crises and howmarkets may be used to respond to crisis. Thisissue of Field Exchange carries a number ofpieces about the cause and effect of the currentfood price crisis, as well as possible responses. According to a recently published ALNAP paper, summarised in this issue, food prices haveincreased by an average of 52% between 2007and 2008. The ALNAP paper aims to assist thoseagencies undertaking operational relief andrecovery work in the context of high food prices.It provides a framework for analysing the prob-lem and designing a response. The Centre forStrategic and International Studies (CSIS)launched a task force on the current food crisis.Its report cites a number of root causes of thecrisis. These include soaring global energyprices, rise in the production of bio-fuels basedon food grains, demand for cereal grainsoutstripping supply, bad weather, and grossunder-investment in agricultural production andtechnology in the developing world. Otherfactors singled out for blame are the agriculturaland trading subsidies and tariffs that creategrave distortions, disadvantaging producers inpoor developing countries, and an antiquatedinternational system of mobilising and deploy-ing food relief that slows the response to emer-gencies and imposes unacceptable costs andinefficiencies. The report contains a number ofrecommendations to address the crisis, includinga modernisation of emergency assistance and are-focusing of US trade policy on promotingdeveloping country agriculture. A paper by FANTA deals with the under- served area of humanitarian interventionsamongst urban populations. The authors exam-ine the growing trend in urban crisis - which isoften mediated through market distortion andhyper-inflation and the various urban specificinterventions to address food and nutritionalcrisis. Two key highlighted interventions involvemarket channels - market assistance programmes and support to national strategic grainreserves.

The tool allowed for sophisti-cated analysis of market conditions leading tohighly nuanced recommendations regardinginterventions in timber and bean markets. Thetool can be used by non-specialists and canhelp determine the appropriateness and opti-mal design for a broad range of responseoptions including cash transfers. This issue of Field Exchange has its usual fair share of new and cutting edge programminginitiatives. At a time of deepening gloom overthe global economic downturn and our sleep-walking into environmental catastrophe,successful innovation and problem solving inour sector serves to maintain some degree ofoptimism and sense of progress. A field article by Action Contre la Faim (ACF) describes their experience of implementing anew survey method for assessing acute malnu-trition in nomadic pastoralist populations. Thesampling method can be used for collectinginformation on many different variables in addi-tion to malnutrition. In particular, it gets aroundproblems of selecting a sample in an area with amobile, low density population for whom thereare few reliable data on population size at thecommunity level. The Italian NGO COOPI (Cooperazione Internazionale) has contributed a field articlefrom the Democratic Republic of the Congo(DRC), which describes another take on estimat-ing coverage of CTC programmes. Having foundthe centric systematic area sampling (CSAS)approach to be too time consuming and biasedwhen there is poor mapping detail availableand recent population movement - both prob-lems they encountered - COOPI developed amodified approach involving GPS, which theyemployed in Goma. This approach appears tobe quicker and more accurate as the first'mapping' phase freed up the survey team,allowing them to focus their energies on actu-ally collecting the data. A paper by the Alchemy project summarises lessons learnt in implementing micro-creditand other loan programmes for long termrefugee and displaced populations. Such inter-ventions have not been widely applied but mayhave an important role in certain refugeecontexts. Finally, a word on our own piece of innova- tion. We would like to announce the launch ofthe ENNs online forum, en-net, funded byUSAID/OFDA. It will enable field practitioners topose urgent and challenging questions theyface on emergency nutrition/food securityprogramming, and so access a wide range ofexperience-based and expert advice that is notreflected in standard guidelines - a sort of inter-active Field Exchange. As we launch this initia-tive, we welcome feedback on the facility andlook forward to the questions and debate thatmaterialise and that may well feature in futureissues of Field Exchange. Jeremy Shoham Editor This article describes a work in progress by Oxfam GB in developing a new tool to enableemergency practitioners to map and analysemarkets in emergencies Good practice standards1, guidelines and evaluations, all emphasise theimportance of including markets inemergency situation and response analysis. However, in practice, emergencypractitioners have often overlooked the poten-tial and actual role of markets in emergencyand early recovery responses. This is mainlydue to uncertainty of how to understand orwork with traders and other market actors inan emergency setting, and unfamiliarity withthe private sector. Commonly cited challengesinclude not knowing what data to gather andfrom where (macro versus micro levels), howto interpret basic information collected, suchas prices, or how to translate analysis intoprogramme decisions. Recent trends in humanitarian responses indicate an increase in agency use of cash-based initiatives alongside or in place ofconventional relief distributions of food andnon-food items and local procurement. Someof these cash interventions are also imple-mented without proper assessment of marketactors' capacity to respond to householdsincreased purchasing power, or analysis of therisks of abuse of market-power (uncompeti-tive behaviour). These analytical challenges and implemen- tation trends indicate the need for bettermarket analysis capacity. The EMMA(Emergency Market Mapping and Analysis)tool has been developed for Oxfam GB andInternational Rescue Committee UK (IRC) byPractical Action Consulting to enable moreappropriate emergency and early recoveryresponses by enabling agencies to undertakeessential market analysis.Emergency Market Mapping and Analysis(EMMA) tool By Lili Mohiddin and Mike Albu Lili Mohiddin has been an Emergency Food Security andLivelihoods Advisor with OXFAMGB since September 2005, basedin the UK.Mike Albu is an international proj- ects manager with the Markets &Livelihoods programme ofPractical Action since 1999, basedin the UK Many thanks to the agencies, especially IRC-UK, that have made this work possible in Haiti, Myanmar, Kenya and in UK and via USA-based discussions and forums. In Haiti, the collaboration of Red Cross (Haiti andCanada), Oxfam (GB, Intermon and Quebec) and ACDI/ VOCA was vital. Our gratitude goes to Emmet Murphyand Anita Auerbach who contributed hugely to both the development of EMMA and the pilot in Haiti. Thanksalso to the project donors that include OFDA, Waterloo Foundation and Oxfam GB . 1Sphere Project 2004 editionBanana plantation in Cabaret, 35 km north of Port-au-Prince. The area's key crop, destroyed by the hurricane. Diana Hernandez Cordero/Oxfam, Haiti, 20083Field Article The rationale for EMMA is that better under- standing of the key market-systems in anygiven situation could enable humanitarianagencies to consider a broader range ofresponses. These responses might include cash-based interventions, local procurement andother innovative forms of support to marketactors (e.g. traders) that enable programmes tomake better use of existing market-systemcapabilities. This could lead to more efficientuse of humanitarian resources, as well asencouraging recovery and reducing depend-ency on outside assistance. With few exceptions, crisis-affected house- holds use markets or other forms of exchangefor acquiring food, hygienic items and services, or for selling products and labour to others.There is a growing realisation that unless ourresponses are designed with a good under-standing of key market-systems, they mayinadvertently damage livelihoods, jobs andbusinesses; thus undermine recovery andprolong dependence on outside assistance. EMMA - What is it? The EMMA toolkit is a set of tools and guidancenotes, designed to encourage and assist front-line humanitarian staff in sudden-onset emer-gencies to better understand and make use ofmarket-systems. EMMA aims to provide accessible, relevant guidance to staff who are not already specialistsin market analysis. The EMMA toolkit isintended to complement established humani-tarian practices in diverse contexts, so that theEMMA process can be integrated flexibly intodifferent organisations' emergency assessmentsand response planning. Above all, the EMMAtools are adaptable, 'rough-and-ready', speed-orientated processes, designed to reflect theinformation constraints and urgency of deci-sion-making required in the first few weeks of asudden-onset emergency. Four 'strands' run throughout EMMA. At the start, they may be relatively separate, butlike the strands of a rope, as EMMA proceedsthey (should) come together to provide a strongand coherent rationale for the final recommen-dations to hang upon (see diagram). The fourstrands are: 1. Gap Analysis: to understand the needs, livelihood strategies, emergency situation and preferences of the target population. 2. Baseline Mapping: to develop a profile of the 'normal' pre-crisis market-system. Seasonal analysis is included. 3. Emergency Mapping: to understand the crisis situation, the impacts on market-system, its constraints and capabilities to play a role in humanitarian response. 4. Response Analysis: to explore different opportunities for humanitarian assistance: their respective feasibility, likely outcomes, benefits and risks. EMMA helps humanitarian agencies to under- stand the important market aspects of an emer- gency situation and communicate this knowl- edge promptly and effectively into programmedecision-making processes. Understanding market-related aspects of an emergency situation means knowing: How did affected populations engage with and use markets as part of their livelihoods before the crisis, and how they are doing so now? What has been the impact of the emergency on the most critical market-systems that people depended upon before the crisis? What capacity do these market-systems now have to supply priority goods and services topeople if the affected population had purchasing power (i.e. cash to spend)? What would be the impact on these market systems if essential services were brought infrom outside the market area (i.e. in-kind assistance)? How might key market-systems be quickly assisted to recover or function better so theycontribute more effectively to meeting affected population's emergency needs? Answers to these questions are relevant to agencies considering the use of cash-basedinterventions or prolonged in-kind responses.They are also important for thinking about howany response might either encourage subse-quent recovery or prolong dependence onoutside assistance. Communicating this knowledge means ensuring analysis results feed into the key deci-sion-making processes of the organisation. Thetoolkit emphasizes succinct, accessible, non-technical formats targeted at the analysis users:programme managers responsible for planninginitial and early responses to crisis. Why market-systems matter in designing early responses For ensuring survivalFor protecting Market-systems where fast-moving events mean agencies have little advance knowledge of markets and limited resources to investigate. A Broad Range of Needs: any market system that may be critical in addressing priority needs, including food, non-food items and supporting services. Rapid Assessment and Decision-making: supporting humanitarian teams to take urgent response decisions faced in the first few weeks. 2Market Analysis Tools in Rapid-Onset Emergencies - Phase 1 report. Albu and Murphy. July 2007 Practical ActionConsulting 3Market-systems involve a web of people, structures and rules. Their interactions together determine how any givenitem, product or service is produced, exchanged and accessedby different people. The market-system concept includesaspects (infrastructure, services, policy, rules and institutions)that are not always emphasized in value-chain analysis. Prior to initiating the development of EMMA, a review was undertaken better tounderstand the need for such a tool in rapidonset emergency settings 2. The review sought to better understand market analysis needs, deci-sion maker information requirements, identifyexisting market analysis tools, and get a betterunderstanding of the capacity of field level staffwho would undertake such analysis.Conclusions underlined the need for a user-friendly non-specialist analytical tool, as manyexisting market analysis tools were too special-ist or development orientated and therefore notsuitable to emergency settings where specialistsare hard to locate. Why is market analysis in emergencies important? During the early phase of a rapid onset disaster, humanitarian priorities are essentiallyconcerned with ensuring survival and protect-ing livelihoods rather than the assessment ofmarket-systems 3, even if the need for this kind of analysis is increasingly recognised. Two men stand on the roof of their flooded home in Gonaives, thefourth largest city in Haiti, followingtropical storm Hanna. Oxfam GB, Haiti, 20084Field Article Market-System Map A main tool in EMMA is the Market-SystemMap (examples given in case studies). The mapsand other data make comparisons between thebaseline and emergency situation. As they givea brief visual representation of the impact of ashock on a market system, the maps are a keycommunication tool for busy decision-makers. As market-systems are different and particu- lar to every good, crop, non-food item or service,EMMA has to independently analyse the market-systems for different items (e.g. sorghum, cloth-ing, transport services). Prior to using EMMAand using their needs and gap analysis, practi-tioners select which market-systems (i.e. whichitem, crops, product) are critical from the human-itarian emergency perspective. Mapping requires research and interviews with different market actors and other inform-ants. The aim is to rapidly draw up compre-hensive baseline and emergency-affectedpictures of the system, which capture the mostrelevant available information about the situa-tion before and since crisis onset. Why use EMMA? To make early decisions about which form/s and/or combinations of different direct response (such as cash-based and/or in-kind response) options is the most appro-priate in meeting immediate needs. EMMA helps you compare the likely outcomes and relative risks of different interventions. To assess opportunities for complementary 'indirect' actions. EMMA explores opportu-nities for alternative forms of market-system support that could rehabilitate or assist recovery of critical market-systems, i.e. thosethat are most critical for ensuring survival and protecting livelihoods. In doing so, inter-ventions ensure more long-term stability andsupply within the affected area or region. To track the continuing impact of the crisis - and of our own humanitarian responses - thereby reducing the risk of 'doing harm'. As EMMA increases awareness of the potential for harm to businesses and house-holds in critical market-systems, it contributes to reduce aid dependency, promote long-term recovery and increase the stability of key local markets. To assist in monitoring performance and accessibility of market-systems, aiding changes in programme implementation An indirect response is any action working with other actors - traders, officials, suppliers - to indirectly help target households, such as:Rehabilitation of key infrastructure, transport links. Grants (or loan guarantees) for local businesses to restore stocks, rehabilitate premises or transport assets. Provision of technical expertise, business services. Emergencies often cause temporary damage to market functions and trade networks. These problemscan be made worse by inappropriate humanitarianresponses, for example:The depression of a local economy due to loss of income may be aggravated by prolonged in-kind relief. Inflationary price rises due to local shortages of essential goods can be intensified by ill-considered cash-transfers. decisions. EMMA includes a monitoring tool that can help agencies track both the continuing impact of a crisis, and the outcomes of humanita rian actions, on critical ma rketsystems. To reveal and define the requirements for more detailed market analysis. Where infor-mation is poor, time is short or skills to interpret market data are lacking, EMMA can help define Terms of Reference for morethorough research. To improve the quality of disaster prepared- ness and planning. In contexts of frequent shock, EMMA market mapping and profilescan provide necessary knowledge of how critical market-systems work, their potentialand vulnerabilities. Advocacy and influencing NGOS and donors. EMMA can provide agencies with information needed to influence donor funding decisions and agency implementa-tion choices, improving intra-agency coordi-nation and consistency. When can EMMA be used? EMMA has been conceived to help address thelimited capacity and confidence for doing rapid'rough-and-ready' market-system analysisduring the first few weeks of a sudden onsetemergency situation, when staff time isprecious and expert market analysis capabili-ties are not yet available to agencies. In principle, EMMA can be used as soon as an emergency situation has stabilised suffi-ciently that the findings are not in danger ofbecoming immediately out-of-date due tofurther changes. Typically, this means thatabsolute priority needs are being addressed,any displaced people will have settled, andmarket-system actors (producers, retailers,traders) will have had a chance to assess theirown situation and begin devising coping strate-gies. This could be within two weeks of anemergency, if staff and resources are available. Equally, EMMA may continue to be useful for many weeks (or even months) into a crisis, iffor whatever reasons humanitarian agencies'understanding of key market-systems thatrelate to emergency needs remains sketchy. Who is EMMA for? EMMA is intended for humanitarian staff doingearly assessments on the frontline duringsudden-onset emergencies, and by extension,for their managers and decision-makers respon-sible for planning initial and early responses tocrisis. EMMA is designed for generalists, as well as staff working in food security, shelter, waterand sanitation, who have little or no previousexperience of economic or market analysisspecifically. For this reason, EMMA tries toavoid technical language, or tools whichrequire detailed quantitative skills. Time and human resources needed It is difficult to predict how long EMMA takesto implement. There are many variables, suchas context, scale of the emergency and traveldistances. Two scenarios are envisaged: Single-handed EMMA process EMMA is conducted by an experienced loneEMMA practitioner, with assistance from one or two colleagues with local knowledgeof the crisis area. This is quicker (estimated at 9-16 days including background reading, field work, travel, analysis and report writ-ing), but the amount of territory that can be covered is limited. Team-based EMMA process EMMA is conducted by a team, led by an experienced EMMA leader who is responsi-ble for training a small team of local interviewers/assessors. This takes longer, and is more uncertain (quality of team) but poten-tially can cover a lot more territory (depending on the size of the team). The time required for this process is estimated atan additional 8-10 days to include staff recruitment and training, etc. A guide, 'Training an EMMA Team in Emergencies', is included in the EMMA reference manual. Work in progress - EMMA to date and next steps Following the development of a draft toolkit and manual, EMMA has been piloted in threelocations, (Haiti, Myanmar and Kenya), withthe last and fourth pilot planned for Pakistan inJanuary/February 2009. To ensure toolkit suit-ability and effectiveness, modifications aremade after each pilot using lessons learned andreflections from pilot teams and the pilotconsultant. To facilitate tool relevance and adoption once completed, from inception the develop-ment of EMMA has aimed to involve as manyinternational agencies as possible. This hasincluded the establishment of a common infor-mation and discussion website (details below)and multi agency piloting and updates. With the toolkit and technical manual planned for completion in early 2009, EMMAtraining materials will be developed andpiloted over the next 6-9 months. All EMMAoutputs (toolkit, manual and training materials)will be made available to agencies for theirown/ combined coordinated use in rapid onsetdisasters.Selling sugar on Carrefour-Feuilles Market - with prices rising, thesetraders are selling 3 sacks a weekcompared to 2 per day previously.Diana Hernandez Cordero/Oxfam GB, Haiti, 20085Field Article EMMA was piloted in Haiti in September/ October 2008 by three agencies, the RedCross 5(Haitian, Canadian), ACDI/VOCA6 and Oxfam (GB, Intermon, Quebec)responding to the tropical storms (Fay,Gustav, Hanna and Ike) 7that struck last summer. Each organisation was involved inemergency response activities to addressbasic needs or protect livelihoods and in thephase of designing future programme activ-ities based on assessments. EMMA was usedto understand the market systems as part ofa process of ascertaining appropriateresponse modalities. Two market systems -timber for construction and beans - wereanalysed. The timber market system The Red Cross identified shelter as a priorityneed in their implementation areas of St.Marc, Desdunes and Grande Saline. As themajority of households use timber forconstruction, they decided to analyse thetimber market. EMMA was used to identifythe most appropriate intervention modality.Some specific programme questions thatneeded answering included: What is the market capacity to supply timber (for reconstruction) to the affected population? Can cash be used or direct purchase? EMMA analysis enabled the teams to answer these questions but also considerthe timing and organisation of a potentialresponse. Findings included: Imported timber market system had to be analysed in detail as target households previously relied on locally grown timber,thus contributing to unacceptably high levels of environmental degradation. The timber supply chain is normally stable and was functioning well in both the non-affected and affected areas (see market map in Figure 1). As traders were importing more than double the whole target population timber needs in one week, the market system had the capacity to respond to the predicted population household timber demand at every level of the chain. Timber suppliers would only require one month notification. Recommendations included: Using basic seasonal calendar analysis in the target area, the reconstruction period was planned not to coincide with peak labour/agricultural activities. As weak competition was identified in one implementation area (Saint Marc), addi-tional care and attention to agreements and contracts was warranted. The intervention should try, where possible, to source timber from the nearest available supplier to inject cash into the local economyand affected area. Although most cash preconditions were favourable and traders would have been compliant, households expressed a prefer-ence for an in-kind response. This was due to concerns regarding trader corruption andtheir financial and logistical inability to transport the timber to their household. These constraints could be overcome and cash/vouchers used, with further investiga-tion and discussion with communities, traders and transport agencies and through establishing a monitoring and accountabilitysystem. Additional analysis is required to ascertain other factors, including the availability of other shelter materials, the willingness of communities to participate, local labour skill levels to guarantee minimum standards in construction and land tenure agreements. The beans (haricots) market system This market system was analysed byACDI/VOCA and Oxfam teams because it wasconsidered an essential component of theHaitian diet and a good indicator of the overallfunctioning of the national food market.EMMA analysis was undertaken in two areas -Artibonite (Gonaives) and the South East (SE)(Jacmel, La Vallee and Bainet). At the time of analysis, imported food aid was being delivered to most affected house-holds and many non-governmental organisa- tions (NGOs) were curious as to how the hurri-canes had affected bean farmers and traders.EMMA was used to understand better theimplementation context and investigate poten-tial response decisions. The following questionswere of particular interest: How the crisis has affected farmers' access to bean markets (to sell produce)? What is the availability of bean supplies (for purchase/consumption)? How has the crisis affected bean market chain actors and how are they coping? When should food aid be stopped, and how? Findings included: Due to the timing and impact locations of the hurricanes and storms, bean prices varied significantly across Haiti. With the hurricane season being more destructive than usual, bean crop losses were high (50-90%), which heavily affected the local economy and diet. Agricultural land was damaged and varying levels of rehabilitation required. The relationships between principal market system actors (see market map) were affected, especially in the case of whole-salers and small farmers. The local markets and economy seemed robust enough to respond to an increased bean demand with advance notification. Local and preferred varieties may have to be replaced by cheaper less popular imported varieties. Traders were able to access further supplies and many said they only needed consumer demand to initiate this. Although rural market sellers were fewer than seasonally expected, they mentioned higher than normal surpluses. This could have been due to food aid and lower local purchasing power. The conditions of secondary and tertiary roads were improving gradually, facilitatingtransportation of commodities to and from markets. Destruction of trader stocks and storage facilities and the breakdown of the informalcredit systems would affect the early Haiti case study The case study below outlines a recent use of EMMA in a post emergency situation and response analysis4. More information and details are available on request. Figure 2: Bean market system in Haiti after 2008 hurricane Figure 1: Timber Market System after the cyclones in 20086Research recovery of market system actors in the affected areas. Therefore it was likely that prices would take time to decrease to pre-crisis levels as traders tried to compensate for their losses. The decrease in bean demand due to lack of cash or food aid reduced trader incen-tive to rehabilitate and recover their activities. This was especially worrying in Gonaives, where the rehabilitation process would take longer due to enor-mous amounts of mud clogging the streets and a large number of poorly coordinated responses between agencies. Poor households (including producers) rely heavily on cash to purchase more than half of the food consumed. Higher prices mean that many are forced to consume less and risk nutritional deteri-oration. Although food aid filled the gap for some households, targeting was diffi-cult and many were not included. Recommendations included: Increase the purchasing power of target beneficiaries by injecting cash into the local economy via cash transfer programmes. Provide support to some traders that may need access to credit in order to re-stock (particularly in Gonaives) or to rebuild storage facilities (wholesalers in Gonaives). Provide bean seeds and agricultural inputs to farmers to ensure planting of the subsequent crop. Stopping food aid by the time the next harvest begins. Food for Work and Cash for Work activity timing should consider seasonal liveli-hood activities/opportunities to ensure labour availability. Stagger implementation periods based recovery capacities. In La Vallee and Bainet, targeted distributions may only be necessary until the next harvest if farmers are assisted to recover through targeted agricultural inputs. As households frequent markets 3 - 5 times/week, buying in small quantities (due to lack of cash, storage facilities andrefrigeration), organisations should consider these aspects and security risks for those receiving large amounts of assistance. During harvest months, agencies should complement the local availability of foodby implementing interventions that harness local production.

However, the accuracy of such publicstatements is rarely scrutinised. A recent articlein the Lancet challenges the technical basis ofsuch claims. The above figure and indicator most frequently cited for the magnitude and severityof hunger is the Food and AgricultureOrganisation's (FAO) proportion of the popula-tion undernourished. The indicator is also usedto monitor the progress towards MillenniumDevelopment Goal 1 (MDG1). The figure hasbeen questioned in terms of inadequacy ofadjustments for calorie requirements.However, the Lancet article levels more seriouscriticisms at the estimate. The fact that the dataare derived from food availability data is themain problem. This is a macro-economic indi-cator based on national food balance sheetanalysis and therefore tells us nothing aboutthe hungry, e.g. who they are, where they areand how they look. Another frequently cited indicator is the prevalence of underweight children under 5years of age, which is also used for monitoringthe progress towards MDG1. The authoracknowledges that this is more meaningful inthat it is derived from actual measurements ofindividuals. However, there are still three typesof limitation. First, malnutrition is not causedexclusively by household food security but alsoby other factors, e.g. disease, inappropriatefeeding practices. Therefore, there may be false 1Aiga. H (2008).

Second, since there isan obvious lag between becoming hungry andthen becoming underweight, the indicator lackstime-sensitivity. Third, the indicator overlooksa parental behaviour common across countries:parents tend to ensure food for their children byreducing their own portions. The prevalence ofunderweight children cannot be extrapolated toan estimation of hunger in older age groupsbecause of this risk of underestimation. According to the author, the proportion of the population below the national poverty linefor food can also be used as a proxy indicatorfor hungry people. This is generally defined asthe expenditure needed to purchase the foodbasket that meets the country-specific mini-mum calorie requirements for an individual.However, the indicator is not readily availableacross countries, probably because of the lack ofstandardisation in defining the food basket. The author also points out weaknesses in definitions of food security and the lack of athreshold and concludes that hunger willcontinue to be relevant after 2015 (the targetyear of the MDGs) and that appropriate indica-tors for hunger need urgent reconsideration. Asthe author puts it \"the moment this is beingread, someone, somewhere in the world isbecoming hungry and that person must becounted.\" Emergency food distribution in Agok, Sudan. UNMIS/Tim McKulca, Sudan, 20087Research In May 2008, in response to the growing global food crisis, the Centre for Strategic andInternational Studies (CSIS) launched a taskforce to assess the rising humanitarian, security,developmental, and market impacts of risingfood costs and shortages. The task forceconvened two high level meetings withmembers of the United States (US) governmentand experts in the fields of food supply, energy,bio-fuels, trade, relief efforts and agriculture.The resulting report reflected a strong majorityconsensus on ways forward. The authors of the report assert that the crisis poses three fundamental threats: a moral andhumanitarian threat, a developmental threatthat is endangering the economic gains of thepast decades, and a strategic threat resulting infood-related riots and unrest with heavilyurbanised nations most at risk. The report cites a number of root causes of the crisis: Soaring global energy prices contributing to cost increases in agricultural production and transportation. Rise in the production of bio-fuels based on food grains. Demand for cereal grains has outstripped supply over the past several years. Bad weather, linked possibly to global climate change. In past decades, a gross under investment in agricultural production and technology in the developing world. The present global agricultural production and trading system, built on subsidies and tariffs, creates grave distortions, disadvantag-ing producers in poor developing countries. An antiquated international system of mobilising and deploying food relief slows the response to emergencies and imposes unacceptable costs and inefficiencies. Under the current US system, US-procuredcommodities (mandated by law, and accounting for over 40 percent of the World Food Programme's (WFP) supplies) can takeup to six months to reach intended benefici-aries. Shipping, handling, and other management costs were consuming 65 percent of budgets as of early 2007, with the percentage continuing to rise. US-origin grain often arrives late and dampens rural grain prices. The CSIS Task Force argued that urgent action is needed on two fronts - emergency relief andrelated safety net programmes, and longer-termefforts to reduce poverty and hunger. Thefollowing recommendations were made:Modernise emergency assistance. - Increase the scale of US commitment and significantly improve the speed, agility, liquidity, and flexibility of the US response. - Double the US level of annual commitment to emergency food relief from $1.6 billion to$3.2 billion. - Require that no less than 25 percent and as much as 50 percent of these expanded emergency funds be available for local andregional purchases. The targets for local and regional purchases should be raised over a five-year period, so that ultimately at least 50 percent and as much as 75 percent of emergency funds are available for local and regional purchases. - Pursue a robust multilateral approach: reconstitute the Food Aid Convention to reflect better current tonnage and nutri-tional needs and reinvigorate donor commitments. R enew regular international consultations on emergency food relief response and actively test the feasibility of emergency regional food stocks and the capacity for rapid regional purchases. - Intensify US food security diplomacy: encourage major oil-producing countries tocontribute more to food relief. Press for more stable and predicable international financing mechanisms for supporting the WFP and its implementing partners. - Enlarge, bilaterally and multilaterally, emergency social safety net programmes such as budget support, school feeding, and food for work. Pursue innovative financial and risk management tools such as vouchers and insurance schemes. Expand nutritional assistance programmes to pregnant and lactating women. Make rural development and agricultural productivity US foreign policy priorities.For example, elevate agriculture to be a top priority of US foreign assistance strategy. Set an official target to increase significantly productivity in the developing world in the next decade, support the doubling of agricul-tural programming by multilateral institu-tions such as the World Bank, and better coor-dinate and integrate US foreign assistance programmes. Revise the US approach to bio-fuels. For example, issue an official policy statementthat outlines the steps the US will take to expand food crops for consumption purposesand to decouple food and energy issues so that the debate progresses from one of fuel versus food to fuel and food security. Focus US trade policy on promoting developing country agriculture.For example, press on an urgent basis for a successful conclusion on the Doha Development Round that promotes invest-ment and trade in developing country agri-culture and reduces long-standing subsidy and tariff barriers. Also, take deliberate and bilateral and multilateral diplomatic action toease export bans and restrictions that have contributed to higher food prices including strengthening World Trade Organisation rules on export restrictions. Strengthen US organisational capacities. For example, create a White House-led stand-ing interagency mechanism on global food security and a Food, Agriculture and Nutrition Bureau at the US Agency for International Development (USAID). The report concludes that the current crisis is unlike any food emergency the world has facedin the past. It is caused by a web of intercon-nected forces involving agriculture, energy,climate change, trade, and new marketdemands from emerging markets. The authorscaution that time is of the essence in formulat-ing a response and that the Bush administra-tion, the presidential campaigns, the congres-sional leadership and the next administrationall have a responsibility to move US leadershipforward. Following the CSIS Task Force report, US Senators introduced a bill (S3529) to the US Senatefor a Global Food Security Act of 2008. The five yearappropriation is asking for over US$ 7.5 billion foractions to address food insecurity, $2 billion for theCGIAR (Consultative Group on InternationalAgricultural Research) system for research and $1.5billion for a permanent Board for agricultural educa-tion. There is also a $500 million fund for anEmergency Food Assistance Account which canmake local and regional purchases of food whereappropriate. The legislation would provide USAIDwith the flexibility to respond to emergencies morequickly, without supplanting other foodprogrammes. The legislation still requires approval and financ- ing. It will complement the existing US support forfood and nutrition programmes from the Farm Bill(Title 11 food aid), PEPFAR (President's EmergencyPlan for AIDS Relief) and the Foreign Assistance Bill.

ALNAP2has recently published a paper which aims to assist thoseagencies undertaking operational relief andrecovery work in the context of high food prices. The key areas affected by the food price crisis are said to be Asia, sub-Saharan Africa andCentral America. Experts do not agree on howlong the price crisis will continue. However,most analyses suggest that within 15 months,most of the price spike will disappear. The possi-ble exception is maize prices where the impact ofUnited States (US) ethanol production may stillkeep prices high. In the medium term, staplefood prices are expected to be 20-40% higher in10 years than they were in 2002 in real terms,owing largely to increased real costs of oil andbio-fuel production. The impact of rising foodprices can be seen in places like Kenya. Here theKenya Food Security Steering Group (KFSSG)has identified a number of effects. Theseincluded increased population below thepoverty line, diet changes and reduction in mealfrequency, informal wage rates declining due toincreased demand for casual jobs, rise in schooldrop outs, civil unrest, distress livestock salesamongst pastoralists, and livelihood crises inurban slums and amongst pastoral, agro-pastoraland marginal agricultural farmers. A detailed set of policy prescriptions has been laid out in the Comprehensive Framework forAction, developed by the High Level Task Forceon the Global Food Crisis 3. A number of stake- holders have already begun to address the conse-quences of the crisis. Actions include reallocationof resources, mobilisation of new funds, nutri-tional care and support, supporting social safetynets for the most vulnerable, and supply ofseeds, fertilisers and other basic inputs to small-holders. In addition, major pledges of supportfor agriculture have been made by the African,Asian, Islamic and Inter-American DevelopmentBanks, as well as bilateral donors and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Given allthe above, relief managers and planners arefaced with a range of challenges, problems andquestions and will need to adapt and/or expandhumanitarian aid programming to food insecurepeople. There has already been some evidence ofaction, in Kenya for example (see Box 1).Ideas and lessons The ALNAP paper suggests a number of ideasand lessons:Food price rises call for stronger analysis andmonitoring of food and other basic commodityprices and markets and their impact on the needsand vulnerabilities of different livelihoodgroups. Such analysis is necessary to understandwhat type of assistance is appropriate in whichcontext - food, seeds or cash, for example.However, analysis alone is not sufficient. It isalso important to anticipate how the situationmight change over time and to build in contin-gency measures to ensure that a programme canbe adapted in response, to undertake evidence-based advocacy and to coordinate efforts. Thelivelihoods framework provides a tool foranalysing people's livelihoods and the impact ofspecific threats or shocks on livelihood vulnera-bility. In the context of livelihoods, it is especially important to develop integrated informationstrategies that bring together early warning,assessment, targeting and monitoring and evalu-ation. Here, the Integrated Phase Classification(IPC) work provides invaluable lessons, wherebringing together information specialists,managers and local partners has ensured that thebenefits of an integrated information strategyhave been realised across regions and countriesfacing high food prices. In the context of high food prices, it is espe- cially important to analyse the specific vulnera-bilities of particular household groups, e.g. agri-cultural, agro-pastoral, pastoralist and urbanpoor households. There are also many reasons why it is valu- able for humanitarian agencies to assess andunderstand markets rapidly in emergency situa-tions, all of which are relevant to food-price rises: Markets may offer a fast, cost-effective and empowering way to respond to people's priority needs. Inappropriate relief responses can do further damage to market systems. The way markets respond to interventions can indicate whether the response is workingas intended. Market recovery is a necessary aspect of livelihood rehabilitation and food security.Global food price crisis: lessons and ideas for relief planners and managers Summary of published research1 According to the KFSSG meeting report, FAO, WFP , UNDP , UNICEF and OCHA4 agreed five priority areas of activity in Kenya in response to rising food prices: 1. An integrated joint programme between WFP and FAO on cash/food for work transfers where appropriate, but focusing on marginalised farmers along river valleys who can improve their productivity from small-scale irrigation projects. 2. UNICEF/WFP/WHO have agreed to consult around the issue of surveillance and management of both moderate and acute malnutrition through therapeutic and supplementary feeding, with focus on urban/peri-urban poor and pastoralists. 3. FAO is to consult with partners on urban agriculture projects, including with Solidarites 5, on the expansion of their pilot project on vegetable production in slum areas. These activities are proposed for other towns such as Kisumu, Mombassa and Nakuru. 4. FAO is to consult with other stakeholders and develop a proposal on emergency response to the PPR 6outbreak among small ruminants in pastoral districts. 5. Provision of assistance to pastoralists who have already been, or are close to being, forced to drop out of pastoralism. Box 1: United Nations (UN) priority areas in Kenya Crises in market systems can also be oppor- tunities for reconstruction and addressing issues of market power, equity and access. Market analysis by institutions such as CILSS 7, FEWS NET8, SIMA9and the WFP have generated important lessons, e.g. a sub-regional approach ispreferable to a purely national approach andassessments should devote more attention todemand factors at the micro-level. Also, marketmonitoring should be conducted on the basis ofan agreed understanding of market structures,conduct and performance, and the analysisshould cover flow information as well as prices. Once analysis of the current situation is complete, it is important to extend it into thefuture and consider different scenarios (see Table1). There are several different methods ofscenario development, e.g. best to worstapproach (self-explanatory), and augmentationor step scenarios that try to set levels at whichadditional action and response capacity isrequired. A 'time' approach defines conditions atset points in time starting with the onset of theemergency, while the 'operational resource'approach is based on understanding the types ofoperation required under different circum-stances. Contingency planning can make a significant contribution to improving operational anticipa-tion and flexibility (see example in Box 2). Itprovides an opportunity to identify constraintsand focus on operational issues prior to the onsetof a crisis, enables individuals, teams and organ-isations to establish working relationships, helps Table 1: Advantages and uses of different approaches to scenario development Scenario/ approachAdvantages Best use Best, most likely,and worst case Provides a basis for planning for different scales of problems Easy to understandPlanning for a single situation When scenario development involves many actors Augmentation Good for planning for situations which increase in magnitude over time Easy to build plans which allow for expansion of operationsDisplacement situations (internally displaced populations and refugees) Timeline Allows planners to adapt operations over time while a crisis evolvesWhen rapid-onset disasters occur, response needs can change very rapidly in the initial days and weeks Operationally representative Allows for a greater focus on operations Can be used to develop more flexible plans Can be used to identify preparedness actions that help in multiple situations Situations that are 1ALNAP (2008): The global food price crisis: Lessons and ideas for relief planners and managers.

This is the Livelihood Protection Cost Index(LPCI), a weather-based index aimed at providing anobjective, independently verifiable and replicableindicator of livelihood loss. The index is developed byevaluating historical weather data and determiningits correlation to crop yields and revenues. One possi-ble application of the LPCI to pastoral areas is beingdiscussed, whereby weather data could be correlatedto grass cover and forage conditions using theLivestock Early Warning System methodology. Similarapproaches might usefully be explored in the contextof rising food prices. reinforce coordination mechanisms by keeping them alive and allows organisations to put inplace measures that enhance preparedness. Goodcontingency planning will include appropriateprogramming options and triggers for action, aswell as predetermined roles and responsibilitiesamongst different actors. There are two broadapproaches in humanitarian contingency plan-ning: Needs-based planning, where planners must analyse existing operational capacity to determine how much strengthening will be needed to meet anticipated needs. Capacity-based planning, which uses avail- able capacity as a basis for planning, regard-less of anticipated needs. This approach can be used to plan for the initial phase of a crisiswhere external resources are not readily available. Coordination and partnerships between human- itarian organisations, development organisa-tions, national and local governments andprivate firms are vital to an effective response.Coordinated advocacy is especially important inthe face of rising food prices, to ensure that theconditions faced by the most vulnerable areaddressed in timely and effective manners. To counteract dramatic increases in costs and demand and bring food prices back to levels thatthe poor can afford, agriculture needs to makebig leaps in productivity. Investments are there-fore needed by the private sector. Equally impor-tant are good seeds, improved crop varieties andsupport systems. Water harvesting and waterstorage systems are needed to reduce stresscaused by dry spells and pastoralists needsupport. It is also important to ensure that finan-cial services, such as insurance and credit, areavailable to poor farmers. Careful decisions also have to be made over whether cash or food or a combination of both isneeded to support the worst affected. The decision should not be resource driven. Recent experienceswith cash programmes have shown that: Where markets can provide enough food, and food insecurity is a result of lack of purchasing power, cash can work. The combination of food plus cash can provide all the benefits of both while avoiding the limitations of each. Cash may be more appropriate for certain groups, such as pastoralists. Key points to consider when deliberating over a cash-based response are: Accurate market analysis and monitoring is crucial. There must be realistic assessment of the capacity to distribute cash and sufficient funds for capacity building. Monitoring the impact of cash distributions requires gender sensitivity. Social protection is an umbrella term used to describe a broad range of initiatives and transfersintended to reduce the economic and socialvulnerability of the poor and food insecure.Instruments that provide a seasonal safety net,coupled with other options, can offer a livelihoodpackage that can meet immediate needs, whilebuilding a buffer for the future. Instruments tooffer a safety net include employment-guaranteeschemes or conditional cash transfers, micro-credit, food for work or cash for work, asset trans-fer or production support. Governments, rather than the humanitarian community, should manage and implementsocial protection. NGO involvement should begeared towards facilitation rather than directimplementation and look to increasing their rolein lobbying, advocacy, and capacity building.There is also a role for NGOs to participate insocial mobilisation by engaging with civil societyto hold states accountable to their social contractsand monitor the extent to which social transfersare carried out and who these are serving. Different social protection instruments are appropriate for different sources of vulnerability.A mix of different approaches will be needed indifferent settings (see Table 2). There is growing concern about the implica- tions of rising food prices for cash-based socialprotection, given the eroding value of cash trans-fers in the face of food price inflation. Someargue that this makes the case for index-linkingtransfers. However, this requires governments ordonors to take on the price risk that poor peopleface all the time and demands a degree of flexi-bility in planning and budgeting that govern-ments and donors may find daunting.

The authors assert that the absence of universal benchmarks or criteria to identifyfamine conditions creates uncertainty aboutthe magnitude of the crisis, resulting indelays and inappropriate responses. In thecontext of the current global food crisis,with dramatic price increases and reducedaccessibility to food in already food insecurepopulations, it may become even more crit-ical to develop an internationally accepteddefinition of famine to guide humanitarianresponse and funding and to enforceaccountability. The famine scale proposed by Howe and Devereux is based on scales of intensity andmagnitude. The intensity level in a givenpopulation is based on a combination ofanthropometric and mortality indicatorsand on descriptors of food security. Thesedescriptors include coping strategies andstability of the market and food prices. Theintensity scale is used to assign populationareas within a country to a level, from 0(food secure conditions) to 5 (extremefamine conditions). Intensity levels of 3(famine conditions) or above register as afamine on the magnitude scale, whichranges from minor famine to catastrophicfamine. The magnitude scale is determinedretrospectively by measuring excess mortal-ity caused by the crisis. International agencies raised concerns about the increasing admission rates ofmalnourished children in therapeutic feed-ing centres in the Maradi region betweenFebruary and April 2005. Local surveys inthe Maradi and Taboua regions betweenApril and May 2005 showed that the preva-lence of global acute malnutrition amongchildren aged 6-59 months exceeded the15% critical threshold established by theWorld Health Organisation (WHO). It wasunclear whether these reports represented alocalised event or if the crisis extended toregional and even national levels; the ques-tion of a current or imminent famine wasalso uncertain. Thus the scale and severityof the food crisis in Niger remained indispute. The researchers applied the famine scale to the situation in Niger in 2005 by assessingmortality and household coping strategiesSummary of published research 1Retrospective determination ofwhether famineexisted in NigerAnthony Niger10Research with rates malnutrition, to determine retro- spectively whether famine existed. Surveyswere carried out in eight regions, using strati-fied two stage cluster survey design.Pastoralists (estimated at 5%) were excludedfrom the survey, given the complexity ofsampling this mobile population. Copingstrategies for dealing with insufficient foodneeds since the beginning of the last hungryseason in 2005 were stratified into four mutu-ally exclusive categories: no coping strategies,reversible adaptive strategies that should notharm future livelihoods, irreversible copingstrategies that threatened future livelihoods,and survival strategies involving disengage-ment from any normal livelihoods systems andfocusing purely on survival. Findings The estimated national crude mortality rate was0.4 (0.4-0.5) deaths per 10,000 per day and theunder five mortality rate was 1.7 (1.4-1.9)deaths per 10,000 per day. Nationally, 22.3%(95% confidence interval 19.9%-24.8%) of care-givers of under 5 year olds did not resort to anycoping strategies to deal with insufficient foodneeds. Reversible coping strategies were,however, used by 5.8% (4.7-7.0%) of and 22.6% (20.0% to25.4%) on survival strategies. On the basis of the famine scale, most regions in Niger 2005 experienced food crisisconditions and some areas approached famineproportions. The absence of a universallyaccepted definition of famine contributed todisagreements about the magnitude and sever-ity of the problem. This highlights the need foran internationally agreed definition of famineand for clear guidelines on the timing andmagnitude of a response. Although the utility of the famine scale by Howe and Devereux needs rigorous assess-ments, it does provide more objective criteriathan previous approaches. It also moves from abinary concept of 'famine or no famine' to agraduated approach that captures a range offood insecurity situations. The authors conclude that nutrition surveys such as these, with data collected on malnutri-tion and mortality as well as on coping strate-gies, improves the ability to triangulate differ-ent types of information to determine the truemagnitude of a crisis. 1Reza.A (2008).

A recent studyused a large data set of Bangladeshi children'sheights and weights to explore whetheranthropometry can be used as a tool to exam-ine gender discrimination. In the past, anthro-pometric data from nutritional surveys inBangladesh have not reflected the patterns ofgender discrimination shown in mortalityand demography data. This apparent discrep-ancy may be explained by the growth refer-ences used to calculate standardised nutri-tional indices. The study analysed the linear growth of a large sample of Bangladeshi children (>500,000) aged 6-59 months using the newWorld Health Organisation (WHO) growthstandards and, for comparison, the NationalCentre for Health Statistics (NCHS) and 1990British growth references. Height-for-age wasexamined on the basis that this may be themost sensitive indicator of longer-termdiscrimination in health care and feeding.Trends in stunting were examined from 1990-1999, a decade during which gender discrim-ination in Bangladesh is thought to havediminished. The focus of the analysis was onthe group aged 6-23 months, as this is the ageat which gender differences in health andnutrition have been shown to emerge due toan increased reliance on non-breast milkintakes and vulnerability to diseases. Thedata were collected by the NutritionSurveillance Project (NSP) of the Helen KellerInstitute (HKI) and the Institute of PublicHealth Nutrition. The NSP collected dataevery two months on randomly selectedsamples of children in rural Bangladesh. Three key findings emerge from the study. First, conclusions on sex differences in growthof Bangladeshi children depend on the normused. The three sets of growth curves presentconflicting pictures of the relative growth ofgirls and boys, in relation to both age andtime. Second, conclusions also depend on themethod of analysis used to examine thegrowth curves, whether in relation to theirshape (i.e. an assessment of growth falteringor catch-up with age that captures cumulativeand gradual sex differences) or their relativeposition (i.e. a simple comparison of averageZ-scores or stunting prevalence at a specificage). Finally, there is value in using a largetest population to explore a specific applica-tion of a growth norm. This may also serve toexpose other important issues, such as thecontinued problem of age determination anddigit preference in nutrition surveys. The author asserts that it is encouraging to find that the WHO standards uniquely pres-ent Bangladeshi girls as faltering faster or catching up slower than boys throughouttheir pre-school years, a finding consistentwith the literature on gender discriminationin Bangladesh. Yet, confusion arises if Z-scoreaverages for a specific age group arecompared. For example, use of the WHOstandards for children 6-23 months of agegives girls higher average Z-scores than boys.The author concludes that there a number oftechnical and practical implications of thesefindings. There is a need for further research to examine the causes behind the differences inthe growth curves produced using the threenorms, bearing in mind that differencesreflect variations not only in the referencepopulations used but also the methodologiesapplied to construct the growth curves. Suchresearch should also examine sex differencesin growth in infants under 6 months of age.Practical implications relate to the fact thatanthropometric data are routinely collectedand analysed throughout the world and thatthis affords the opportunity to ensure thatgender discrimination is monitored andreported upon as a matter of course. Furtherresearch and debate are needed to determinewhether and how this can be achieved. Finally, the ongoing global process of implementing the new WHO internationalgrowth standards presents an opportunity toexplore the role of anthropometry for genderanalysis. At the same time, research is neededto corroborate or dispute the study findingsand to help establish whether and how theWHO international standards can most mean-ingfully be used to measure and monitorgender discrimination.

Livestock and in-kind loanscan support a variety of people, including newarrivals or so-called 'vulnerables' such as child-headed households and the disabled. The provision of small stocks (goats, sheep, chickens, ducks, etc) either for breeding or trad-ing purposes can help launch livelihoods andare good starter programmes. Successfulcompletion of an in-kind loan programme canprepare the client for participation in a micro-credit programme. In refugee settings it is best to be conserva- tive about using micro-credit and to wait untilthe agency is familiar with the displacedcommunity, and is working productively withrelief organisations, groups and leaders. Good programme design Before designing and implementing a creditprogramme, NGOs should conduct a marketstudy, identifying market constraints and possi-bilities for clients as well as risk. Good loanappraisal or well designed group loan method-ology will prevent problems arising from repos-session, and is a first step in identifying clientswho might eventually be unable to make repay-ments. In refugee situations, various loanconditions, including legal documentation andcollateral are missing or compromised. But thisneed not necessarily prevent the loan, if appro-priate alternatives can be identified. It might bepossible to waive documentation requirementsonce the implementing agency is familiar withthe community and has the cooperation of keymembers and leaders who can help detect loanrisks. Alternative forms of collateral can beidentified. For example, where refugees haveaccess to farmland, collateral can take the formof vegetables produced by the refugees that areassessed for their market value. In certain situations, refugees may lack any form of collateral and other ways to ensurerepayment, such as group pressure, are absent.Under these circumstances, some agencies haveprovided micro-credit using controversialrepayment strategies. These include workingwith the government so that refugees who didnot repay their loans were not permitted torenew their documents. Given the existence of a grant mentality amongst many refugee populations, it is bestnot to associate micro-credit programmes withUNHCR or relief organisations that have tradi-tionally handed out grants. Furthermore,micro-credit programmes should never beattempted by untrained relief agencies. Theskills and mindset needed to manage andadminister micro-credit programmes are rarelyfound in traditional relief programmes. Loan size, interest rates and repayment frequencyLoan size should be appropriate for the client'senterprise. For refugees it is important that loanamounts are appropriately sized to meet thespecial marketing needs of refugees which mayinclude transport and marketing costs. Theseshould be based on institutional cost assess-ment, inflation, market rates, risk and clientcapacity. Interest is the way in which aprogramme is made sustainable by creating additional income beyond repayments thatcover administrative costs. In Islamic areas,where interest cannot be charged, servicecharges on the loan can be imposed instead.Interest rates can be problematic amongst poorrefugees. Some experts have suggested thatsince refugee programmes are not meant to besustainable, charging nominal interest can be away to create a good credit culture. Provision of a mix of services For refugees with no in-country business expe-rience, marketing assistance can help busi-nesses. Refugees often cannot access marketsand cash economies either because they live inisolated and remote border areas, or because thegovernment's policy requires refugees to stay incamps or restricts freedom of movement. Training of individuals, loan groups and loan committees before loan disbursement ishighly valued by group members, andincreases the success of programmes. The exis-tence of organised groups in the community isan asset in loan programmes, as these createstrong pressures to repay, groups can combinefunds to finance larger businesses and groupsare self-monitoring. Group loan schemes onlywork in environments of trust. Group lendingis inappropriate if clients are unwilling orunable to take responsibility for each other'sdebts. In many refugee and urban contexts,there is a lack of trust and it may be preferableto work with individuals, and put in place othersafeguards to reduce the risk of absconding andnon-payment. In some camps, traditional rotat-ing credit schemes familiar from the homecountry are re-started by the refugees them-selves. It is best to work with existing groups. Resettlement and repatriation All parties involved with the refugees, includ-ing the host government, refugee leaders, reset-tlement organisations and UNHCR, must buildan understanding about how repatriation orresettlement will be managed in the loanprogramme. When UNHCR initiates voluntaryrepatriation or resettlement, agencies can planrepayment schedules accordingly. It might benecessary to make loan periods shorter toreduce repatriation risk in general. Loan cyclesshould be shorter than in non-refugee situa-tions. Credit programmes and refugee livelihoods are supported when governments allowrefugees to work outside of camps, anddisabled when there are government restric-tions on refugee movement. In some cases,governments impose different requirementsand restrictions on different refugee nationali-ties. The biggest challenge remains for NGOsand UNHCR to advocate on behalf of economicfreedom for refugees and the protection of theirrights to pursue a livelihood as set out in the1951 Refugee Convention. The economic contribution of refugee entre- preneurs can be a potential win-win situationfor both host countries and refugee communi-ties. Their economic contribution can bemaximised by agencies advocating for theirrights to work and freedom of movement. 1Jacobsen. K (2004). Micro-credit and other loan programmes in protracted refugee situations: Lessons fromthe Alchemy Project. Feinstein International Centre.http://nutrition.tufts.edu/ 2The Alchemy Project is an experimental project aimed at supporting displaced people's livelihoods by providing accessto a variety of forms of credit. Micro-credit and other types of loan programmes have not been widely attemptedwithin refugee and internally displaced popula-tion (IDP) contexts largely due to the fact thatrepatriation, resettlement or further displace-ment may prevent repayment of loans.However, an increasing number of refugees andIDPs remain 'stuck' in protracted situations,creating potential for using credit-based inter-ventions to support their livelihoods. A recentpaper based on a compilation of best practicesand lessons learned from the 'Alchemy Project' 2 has been made available by the FeinsteinInternational Centre. The paper identifies the main problems affect- ing loan programmes in refugee situations as:i)The difficulties around repatriation, resettle- ment and onward migrations, which createsinstability and problems with repayment. ii)Isolated camps and restrictions on move- ment that create market access problems andtransportation constraints. The main lessons are: Micro-credit is not for everyone. There is a need to make loan size and type appropriate for clients, markets and commu-nity. Do not accept low repayment rates. Include training, monitoring and evaluation in programme design. Micro-credit is not for everyone So called 'vulnerables' are seldom the mostappropriate candidates for micro-credit andtheir presence in a programme can both under-mine the programme and increase the client'svulnerability by exposing them to debt. Micro-credit should be provided only to stable,economically active refugees who have demon-strated their own initiative in starting a busi-ness. Good candidates might also be refugeeswith prior micro-credit experience or experi-ence with formal credit institutions like banks. Bad practices by unqualified agencies trying to do micro-credit include: accepting poor repayment rates doing nothing about absconders or defaulters charging inappropriate or unsustainable interest rates calling a 'grant' a 'loan' allowing loans to be used for consumption purposes targeting micro-credit at vulnerable populations. There are often contradictions between the target group that a non-governmental organisa-tion (NGO) is mandated to support in a refugeecamp context, and whether that group can besupported with credit. Donors and UNHCRoften require that assistance programmes aretargeted at the most vulnerable in the refugeepopulation. The authors argue that livestock and in-kind loans should be used to support those not readyfor micro-credit. Refugees who are not appro-priate candidates can best be helped with tradi-tional relief, or less onerous in-kind loans orsmall livestock programmes. In-kind loanprogrammes have less demanding repaymentMicro-credit in refugee situations Summary of published research11212Research The World Food Programme (WFP) recently commissioned research to investigate theparticipation of recipient communities in thetargeting and management of humanitarianfood assistance in complex emergencies. Fourcase studies were carried out involving deskreviews and field visits. The purpose of theresearch was to understand the ways in whichparticipatory or community-based approachesto targeting (CBTD) have been attemptedwithin the definition of community-basedtargeting suggested by WFP . This definitionincludes the notion of working through local ortraditional leaders to target food to the mostvulnerable. Two of the country case studies aresummarised here. Somalia case study The Somalia case study looked at CBTD underthe ongoing WFP Protracted Relief andRehabilitation Operation (PRRO). The majorityof food aid is targeted to the south-central partof the country where political stability has beenmost problematic. The largest single category ofassistance has been general food distributionfor food insecure rural populations as well asfor internally displaced populations (IDPs).However there is now a substantial amount offood assistance going to urban populations aswell. According to the review, targeting at the geographic level of district and livelihood iswell informed by analysis but less informed byadequate assessment at village and householdlevel. Security considerations, limited staffnumbers and other constraints have long meantthat the actual oversight of what happens to thedelivered food must be left in the hands of localleaders at the village or IDP camp level. Underthese circumstances, there have been allega-tions of widespread diversion of food aid bymilitias and other powerful actors before itreaches the community level, and widespreadpractices of the redistribution of food aidbeyond the WFP-targeted recipients at thecommunity level. The limited access for followup and monitoring means that the real impactof redistribution is not known. In Somalia, the WFP relies to some extent on local leadership to oversee and target food aidwithin the community. However, there are largedifferences in the accountability and legitimacyof local leadership in different locations. Theserange from a reasonable degree of accountabil-ity of leadership in rural communities (wherethe presence of clan elders and religious leadersallowed for some checks and balances andsome redress mechanisms) to populations effec-tively kept in check by 'gate-keepers' whocontrol information, access, and resources. Thelatter type of local leadership tends to predom-inate in IDP camp situations. Although commit-tees of local leaders exist in both situations, thedegree to which leaders actually represent thecommunity differs enormously and most of theevidence about diversion of assistance comesfrom situations in which representation is thelowest. The practice of redistribution limits the number of people in any recipient communitywho are excluded from food assistance, but also ends up ensuring that no one receives verymuch. Strong views were expressed virtuallyeverywhere the study team visited that externalassistance in the form of food should be sharedequally within communities. Much of the process of food aid targeting remains opaque to recipients. They are oftennot aware of their entitlements or the process ofdetermining who is entitled. Redistributionrarely takes place in an organised or supervisedway, and is often so ad hoc and disorganisedthat it results in fighting or even loss to looting. The authors of the Somalia case study conclude that improved targeting would bepromoted by an improved analysis of context,increasing the capacity of staff and partners totarget at the village level, and a willingness towork with the reality of sharing and redistribu-tion. Other means of improving the participa-tion in targeting include identifying andbolstering appropriate checks and balances,involving all stakeholders in planning, improv-ing transparency through informing thecommunity of overall food aid being deliveredand making better use of localised complaintsmechanisms. Columbia case study Columbia has one of the largest displacedcommunities in the world - between 1.8 millionto 3.7 million people. Women and children andmarginalised ethnic minority groups such asthe indigenous and the Afro-Columbian peopleare over-represented among the IDP popula-tions. There are currently 2,000 communitiesassisted under nearly 3,000 projects in PRRO10366. Approximately 499,000 beneficiaries areserved by the PRRO. The case study involved visits to five very different geographic regions. In this case,targeting involves two distinct steps. The firststep involves the use of geographical andadministrative targeting methods, based on geography, population and institutional criteriausing a vast network of informal partners, aswell as a formal agreement with twoGovernment of Columbia (GoC) institutions.The second step involves choosing betweenseven possible food assistance modalities(relief, food for work, food for training, nutri-tional risk, mother and child, pre-school feed-ing and school feeding), each with their ownspecific beneficiary profile and food assistancepackage delivered by a chosen implementingpartners. Both steps involve various decision-making processes. There is ample scope for direct community participation in Columbia because about onethird of WFP implementing partners arecommunity based organisations. Communitybased participation begins after the second stepof targeting and revolves more aroundprogramme implementation than programmedesign and setting selection criteria. The studyfound that some communities can influence theimplementing partners' negotiation processwith WFP to implement a food assistance proj-ect and hence can be said to participate success-fully in the targeting strategy through advo-cacy. This is much more likely to happen incommunities with strong cohesion and withleadership styles that encourage good workingrelations with outsiders wishing to support thatparticular community. In some cases, the bene-ficiary community itself approaches WFP toimplement the project - this was seen to bemore likely to be led by women in urbansettings, where perhaps traditional leadershipstyles had somewhat broken down.Targeting in complex emergencies: the cases of Somalia and Columbia Summary of case studies1,2 1Jaspars.

Columbia country case study. Feinstein International Centre,July 2008. An IDP camp in Somalia where the evaluation was undertaken.Feinstein Famine Centre, Somalia, April, 200813Research The Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance 11 (FANTA-2) Project has recently published apaper to provide technical information andlessons learned to support USAID and its part-ners to design effectively and implement emer-gency food assistance programmes in urbanand peri-urban settings. The USAID Office ofFood for Peace (FFP) food assistanceprogrammes have traditionally focused largelyon rural areas, offering a large body of literatureon best practice. Similar information on urbanfood assistance programming has been limited,particularly in emergencies. The paper sets out a number of factors that may differentiate urban and rural crises result-ing in a different set of response criteria andmechanisms. These include: Urban-rural differences in food security. Food consumption and access - food is generally the largest expense category in the budget of the urban poor and the main source of food insecurity amongst urban populations is food access. Labour market - the urban poor mostly earn cash from low-paying unstable jobs in the informal and formal sectors, with popu-lations displaying a higher degree of economic inequality than rural areas. Social networks and gender - urban social networks are based on political, religious and economic, as well as ethnic, affiliations. Although ethnicity is the dominant factor indetermining residence and settlement in some cities, as a general rule, groups tied together by these factors are less geographi-cally circumscribed in urban than in rural settings. Public health and care practices - urban populations as a whole make greater use of health services than rural populations. Institutional and stakeholder environment - there is a broader range of stakeholders thatcan serve as partners in urban areas than in rural areas. Socioeconomic status - a given population's socioeconomic status is usually higher but more variable in urban areas, with remit-tances a critical source of income. Property issues - urban areas in low-income countries often include unplanned settle-ments or slums, whose residents are frequently at high risk of food insecurity. Rural-to-urban migration and connections - urban and especially peri-urban residents often retain active economic and social linkswith rural areas. Health care in cities may also be a draw for rural to urban migration, particularly for HIV services. Planning food assistance in urban emergencies The paper sets out how to plan food assistance in urban emergencies and specific issues thatrelate to the urban environment. Assessment There is no internationally accepted standardguide or instrument for urban emergency needsassessment. The authors suggest that time andresources permitting, a rapid nutrition survey can be conducted to help provide a representa-tive picture of groups of concern. However,urban under-nutrition prevalence estimatesoften mask significant variation among socioe-conomic groups. Assessing food security inurban contexts is also a challenge. Assessmentsshould aim to capture impact of the crisis onexpenditure on basic needs and householdincome because urban populations tend toaccess most of their food from the market.There are key contextual issues to consider.Population density and poor sanitation elevatethe risk of communicable disease epidemics,including acute diarrhoeal disease. HIV is alsomore prevalent in urban populations, increas-ing nutritional requirements and morbidityrisks during a crisis. Exclusive breastfeedingrates are lower in urban than rural settings, sothe risk of contamination of food and water iselevated in urban emergencies. Targeting Deciding what targeting approach to useusually depends on the proportion of the popu-lation that needs assistance, the type ofprogramme contemplated, trade-offs betweentargeting cost and targeting accuracy, and thefeasibility of targeting options. Considerationsinclude: Proportion of population to receive assis- tance - if the large majority need assistance and resources support a large scale response, then it is not cost-effective to select households and individuals. Type of programme - some programmes require targeting eligible institutions and providing assistance to all individuals at those institutions. Others, like targeted distribution of 'take home' rations, require identifying households that meet certain social or economic criteria. Targeting costs and accuracy - targeting generally entails a trade-off between costs and accuracy. Feasibility of targeting approach - commu- nity based targeting requires accountable and strong community structures, trans-parency and high community engagement. Exit strategies Although most urban emergency food assis-tance programmes will aim to address transi-tory food insecurity within a short (e.g. oneyear) time frame, exit strategies must still beidentified from the outset. Many of the factorscontributing to urban food insecurity - includ-ing rising food prices and climate change-related shocks - are expected to be medium tolong term. This underscores the need to addressunderlying causes, as well as to establish waysto support these populations through nationalstructures (e.g. social safety nets) whereverpossible. An urban emergency food assistanceprogramme's exit strategy should includeEmergency food-based programming in urban settings Summary of published research1 1Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance II Project (FANTA- 2). Emergencies in Urban Settings: A Technical Review ofFood-based Program Options. Washington, DC: FANTA-2,Academy for Educational Development, 2008. Available atwww.fantaproject.orgParticipative methods are encouraged by WFP for all its implementing partners andset out in the Columbia PRRO 10366 opera-tions manual. Important examples includeencouraging meetings with beneficiaries(especially women), explaining the originsof food assistance, and creating a FoodCommittee or equivalent. Close and regularcontact with the communities and imple-menting partners was found to be an essen-tial ingredient for participative and repre-sentative approaches. The WFP has success-fully achieved this in many of the projects itsupports. The creation of representativefood committees in the community to runfood assistance projects was seen to be oneof the most successful ways of balancing outleadership roles and introducing checks tomitigate against corrupt leadership styles.In addition, the food committees were seento have successfully empowered femalecommunity members to advocate for thestrict adherence of the programme selectioncriteria and gain networking and resourcemobilisation skills. Where the food commit-tee was made up of hand-picked friends ofcorrupt community leaders, the scope forcommunity participation was seen to begreatly diminished. Participative consulta-tion techniques were also observed amongrepresentatives of IDPs who had accumu-lated years of experience representing theircommunity and had gained their trust. The main exception to this observation was the mechanism of working with target-ing practices already in place through estab-lished community leadership mechanismsset up for other purposes. This proved to bethe mechanism that was most prone toabuse in terms of promoting participation,especially when associated with the selec-tion criteria under GoC food for workprogrammes. Corrupt leadership is some-thing for which WFP's current targetingstrategy has few checks and balances. Main enabling factors for participatory targeting included: Proximity and trust between community and implementing partners. A targeting strategy that allows for changing needs. Strong community leadership. Urban populations that come together for collective action. Constraining factors included: Inadvertent support for existing systems of selection that are unfair and benefit the elite. Insufficient time spent with beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries to explain targetingcriteria. Implemeting partners having a tendency to work with communities with a higherdegree of cohesion. The case study authors concluded that CBTD is an approach that needs to bejudged for its contribution to more effectivetargeting, as well as for its contribution tomore participatory programming methods.In the case of Columbia, CBTD achievesboth of these objectives when it empowerscommunity members to gain new skills anddoes the opposite when communities causefurther exclusion through unfair systems oftargeting. 14components such as graduation and exit crite- ria, an exit timeline, benchmarks and activitiesrequired to meet those benchmarks, a monitor-ing and evaluation strategy, and a sustainabilitystrategy. Security Population density in urban areas heightens theneed for security and crowd management atsites where food is distributed. Institutional partners and stakeholders Urban settings offer several opportunities topartner with local institutions and stakehold-ers. Two types of stakeholder are more promi-nent in urban settings: central level public serv-ice delivery institutions (e.g. health, education,nutrition extension) and private sector actors.This is important to consider when developingan exit strategy and the handover ofprogramme services. Urban authorities aremore able to monitor and influence programmeactivities in urban settings, underscoring theneed for an active partnership, trans-parency and even legal agreementsto document plans, roles and respon-sibilities related to the programme.Unless urban food assistanceprogrammes work solely throughnational systems, e.g. school feeding,MCHN (Mother, Child Health andNutrition) clinics, they frequentlyrequire negotiating with the urbanprivate sector. For example, access toland is required for wet or dry rationdistribution sites, while access toinfrastructure is required for food forwork. Urban food assistance programme options The remainder of the FANTA-2 report describes and analyses eleventypes of urban food assistanceprogramme options. These are: Targeted household food distribution Food for work Food for training Wet feeding programmes Community-based management of acute malnutrition programmes Supplementary feeding in MCHN programmes Institutional feeding for street children, orphans and other vulnerable children and other vulnerable groups School feeding programmes Food support to child care facilities Market assistance programmes Support to national strategic food reserves For each of these interventions, advantages, disadvantages and programming issues in anurban context are considered. Programmingissues include targeting, long-term develop-mental considerations, specific programmerequirements, risks and potential pitfalls, moni-toring and evaluation considerations and exitstrategies. Urban country examples of eachtype of intervention are also given. For the purposes of this summary, we only highlight key points raised in the paper rele-vant to implementing these interventions in anurban context. We also select one case examplefor each type of intervention. Targeted household food distribution This involves the direct distribution of dry take-home food commodities, usually to pre-identi-fied target groups. It typically targets a largerpopulation than just the traditional category ofvulnerable individuals, e.g. elderly or femaleheaded households. Objectives include meetingimmediate food needs of households unable toaccess their normal sources of food, preventingfamine, protecting livelihoods and/or support-ing livelihood recovery and freeing up incomefor other household needs. Urban targetedhousehold food distribution poses a number ofchallenges, including defining target groupsand identifying eligible beneficiaries (the risk ofinclusion error can be high especially withurban political and social elites), exclusion ofnon-beneficiaries in densely populated areas,defining household in a way that encompassesthe diversity of household compositions seen inurban settings and assisting a large and rela-tively mobile population. Ration planning should consider what staple foods are most appropriate for urban popula-tions. These populations often have diversediets, less time to prepare distributed commodi-ties, and may show higher rates of specificchronic illness, e.g. HIV . Urban households arealso heavily cash dependent and some degreeof monetisation of take-home rations should beexpected to pay for other household necessitieslike rent and fuel. The exit strategy of an urbantargeted household food distribution is particu-larly challenging, given the inequality andstructural poverty in urban centres. Wherepossible, phase-out will be contingent upon there-establishment or expansion of income andfood sources among beneficiaries and afford-ability of local staples, rather than production and the agricultural calendar as in ruralsettings. Finally, it is important to be aware thatdistribution sites can help link beneficiaries upwith other social or economic services to whichmarginalised groups may have had poor access. In 2008, the World Food Programme (WFP) distributed targeted household rations (wheat)to urban and semi-urban households mostaffected by rising wheat flour prices inAfghanistan. The programme targeted1,147,000 chronically poor people, especiallyfemale-headed households, disabled heads ofhouseholds with unreliable income, poorhouseholds with more than 9 family membersand only one income earner, and some recentlydeported poor households from Iran.Beneficiaries were selected by non-governmen-tal organisations (NGOs), government institu-tions and community councils. Food for Work (FFW) Urban FFW programmes are publicworks programmes that pay work-ers with food rather than cash.Given the highly monetised urbaneconomy, such schemes naturallytend to favour the most food inse-cure who will self-select into them.Projects normally focus on urbaninfrastructure - most notably publicwater, sanitation and hygiene serv-ices - thus providing importantpublic benefits. There are numerous challenges to urban FFW. Activities usuallyinvolve issues of private propertyand civil planning before and afterthe project, requiring complexconsultations and arrangementswith a range of stakeholders.Speculation can follow infrastruc-ture improvements, leading to theeviction of the very people the proj-ect aims to assist. Special attention isrequired to protect beneficiariesfrom possible effects of raised rentsand property values followinginfrastructure improvement.Working through municipalgovernment structures is essentialto clearly delimit areas in which theproject will take place, where bene-fits will be expected and whatcommunity support is required.Targeting residents of informalsettlements and slums can be sensi-tive politically, especially whereconstruction in those areas is inviolation of municipal regulations. CARE implemented an urban food for work programme in 25 urban slumcommunities (kabeles) of Addis Ababa from1997-2001. The project focused on road andsanitation infrastructure and the majority ofparticipants were women. Food for Training (FFT) In FFT, beneficiaries are given a food ration inexchange for their participation in an activitydesigned to impart knowledge or skills that cangenerate income. Food can be provided as takehome or on-site feeding or a combination of thetwo. Food is used to compensate for the timespent in training and the opportunity cost ofother economic activities forgone. FFT cansupport recovery of Nairobi,that receives WFPfood support.WFP/S37, Kenya, 200815Research In urban areas, referral centres may be urban tertiary hospitals, which are frequently over-whelmed with cases of SAM. Because urbanpopulations often seek health and nutritionrelated services from a large variety of sources,e.g. traditional healers, private and publicsector, it is especially important to establishcollaboration with these providers and ensurethat core messages related to nutrition areconsistent among these actors. Since incomeinsecurity in urban areas is more related toeconomic volatility than agro-climatic seasonal-ity, predicting and planning for increases incase load can be more challenging. Anotherpotential issue is that because paid outreachworkers and community volunteers are morelikely to come from the same community inurban settings and may be social peers, it mightbe more problematic to have both categories ofworkers within the same programme (one ofwhich is paid and the other unpaid). Valid International (with Concern support) implemented the scale-up of CMAM in Lusaka,Zambia in partnership with the Ministry ofHealth. Supplementary Feeding in Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition Programmes (MCHN)Food can be distributed through MCHNprogrammes to meet a number of objectives:prevention of malnutrition in at-risk groups,recuperation from malnutrition of beneficiariesdetermined to be malnourished, and as anincentive to participate in programme services.Targeting of beneficiaries for food supportthrough MCHN programmes in an urban emer-gency would include preventive models target-ing pregnant and lactating women and children0-24 months of age. A risk factor may be that ifrural areas are underserved, urbanprogrammes could become a magnet. A 2006-9 WFP programme in Angola includes supplementary feeding for about15,000 pregnant and lactating women throughhealth centres in food-insecure areas. Institutional Feeding for Street Children, Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) andother Vulnerable GroupsThis refers to a broad range of interventions allcharacterised by provision of food resources tourban institutions that provide services to streetchildren, OVCs and other vulnerable groups.Facilities may include orphanages, drop-incentres for street children where they receivebasic services, hospitals, long-term care facili-ties/hospices. Food can be given to support foodsecurity and vocational and life-skill training. In emergency situations, these sites can be used to expand rapidly food support to vulner-able groups and also offer the opportunity tolink beneficiaries with other services. However,programmes can become quickly overwhelmedby rapid increases in demand and like all wetfeeding, appropriate sources of cooking fueland safe water must be found. Long-termdevelopment impacts are few unless thesupport is linked to other capacity strengthen-ing initiatives. A potential undesirable conse-quence of programmes is to act as incentive forpoor or food insecure families to place childrenwho are not orphans in orphanages. It also risksundermining traditional community basedmechanisms for supporting OVCs. Also, in low-income countries, these facilities frequentlyreceive no government funding so alternativefunding is required. This is a key issue to consider at the outset of the programme toavoid building institutional dependency onfood assistance. CRS has provided food to orphanages and other OVC facilities in Haiti. CRS provides thedry commodities which are then prepared forwet feeding by facility staff. School feeding programmes These programmes distribute food to schoolsfor on-site wet feeding. They aim principally tosupport food access and prevent deteriorationof nutritional status in children of primaryschool age, and also to boost school attendanceand attainment. School selection in urban areas is challenging because the schools are frequently in close prox-imity. Selection must be justified in a clear andtransparent manner to minimise conflict withneighbouring schools that are not covered. From 2004-8, WFP implemented a school feeding programme in the peri-urban slumsaround Nairobi to provide a dietary support forall children attending school to combat shortterm hunger, improve attention span and cogni-tive ability and provide an incentive to girls andorphans to enrol in, attend and remain at school.The daily food basket consists of 150g of maize,40g of pulses and 5g of vegetable oil per child. Food support to child care centres These programmes aim to alleviate poverty byproviding working parents with low-cost childcare to facilitate the development of their youngchildren and to promote community participa-tion in the overall development of children. Aswith school feeding programmes in urbanemergencies, child care feeding may be imple-mented where there is an existing and wellestablished institution already in place andwhere additional support in the form of foodprovision for the crisis-affected community hasbeen determined to be feasible and appropriate.Lack of child care options may represent amajor obstacle to achieving household liveli-hood and food security among urban women,especially women heads of households. Thecost per child is relatively low, ranging fromUS$ 0.58 per child per day in Columbia toUS$2.15 in Bolivia. Disadvantages include thefact that each child care centre can only serve alimited number of children to be effective, sothat many centres are needed to reach scaleincreasing logistical complexity. Another diffi-culty may be that women who often spend verylong hours away from home between commut-ing and work may have difficulty complyingwith programme participation requirements. In Guatemala, the Hogares Communiatarios began with donated food (including Title 11food aid through Catholic Relief Services).Positive results were obtained on householdincome, child nutrition and psychosocial devel-opment. The value of the programme and itspopularity among the urban poor has moti-vated subsequent governments to maintain theprogramme since its inception in 1998. Market Assistance Programmes (MAP) This programme provides food to food insecurehouseholds through targeted market sales atsubsidised prices. MAPs distribute food throughretail outlets and existing traders and use lesspreferred commodities to assist in self-targeting.Subsidised staple commodities can also be soldthrough a set of programme vendors to benefici-ties, such as for ex-combatants newly inte- grated into urban and peri-urban communities.It can also promote community self-manage-ment, although government systems shouldnot be duplicated. FFT projects in urban areascan build capacity of small-scale traders andinformal entrepreneurs. However, effects ofFFT on rural-to-urban migration should beassessed. World Vision's Food Aid Supporting Transformation in Urban Populationprogramme ended in 2008. It focused heavilyon FFT with an emphasis on health, nutrition,water and sanitation in East Jakarta andSurbaya. The programme had about 4,300 FFTbeneficiaries in 2007. Wet feeding programmes These programmes distribute prepared, cookedfoods to beneficiaries for on-site consumption.They may be appropriate under very specificcircumstances, such as where a distribution oftake-home rations is not feasible due to physi-cal insecurity. It will be necessary to situate wetfeeding sites throughout the urban area tominimise the risks of over-crowding or violenceand other antisocial behaviours, as well as toreduce the distance that programme beneficiar-ies have to travel for meals. As urban wet feed-ing is management intensive, it requires work-ing through local partners. This can mean alonger start-up time if their capacity is notalready strong. In densely populated urbanareas, wet feeding can encourage overcrowdingaround the distribution site, requiring crowdcontrol and management of hygiene and sanita-tion risks. Wet feeding can induce rural-to-urban migration if services are not in place toaddress acute food insecurity in surroundingrural areas. Working with highly mobile urbanpopulations can be a challenge for monitoringand evaluation. SAACID, a Somali NGO, worked with the Danish Refugee Council to run a WFP-supported blanket wet feeding programme ingreater Mogadishu in 2008. The programmeaimed to help the most marginalised andvulnerable internally displaced people withinthe city, as well as the urban poor who lostaccess to work due to conflict. The projectexpanded from 10 to 16 sites and from 50,000 to80,000 meals per day in Mogadishu.Beneficiaries were self-selected. Community-Based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM)These programmes address acute malnutritionthrough inpatient care (for children with severeacute malnutrition (SAM) with complicationsand infants below six months of age with visi-ble SAM), outpatient care (for children withuncomplicated SAM), and communityoutreach. For urban families with economically active adults, CMAM reduces the time that caregiversmust spend in inpatient facilities during stabil-isation and recovery. Referral for health andother services from a CMAM programme,when necessary, is generally easier in urbanthan rural settings due to proximity of healthcentres. However, CMAM requires a strongcommunity outreach system to support timelyreferral and coverage that can be challenging inurban environments - especially in unplannedsettlements. In order to minimise the risk ofoverburdening the existing system, additionalnutritional centres may need to be constructed.16Research ary households identified to be eligible, i.e. where the programme is not self-targeted. There are many advantages of these programmes. They can stabilise volatile foodprices by infusing cheaper foods into the urbanmarkets. If food insecure households tend touse identifiable vendors, these types of vendorscan be specifically enrolled in the programme.Because MAPs work through existing markets,they are easier to undertake than direct distri-bution which usually requires setting up a sepa-rate distribution system. Furthermore, MAPsare usually self-targeting and may be more cost-effective than FFW or targeted household distri-bution because of the reduced cost of distribu-tion and the possibility of earning revenue thatcan help cover costs. MAPs do pose a number of potential risks and pitfalls. Subsidies may stimulate rent seek-ing behaviours among politically and economi-cally advantaged groups, such as traders andgovernment employees. Existing market stocks,purchased earlier at higher prices by retailers,will dampen the initial effect of the subsidy astraders will want to reduce their loss by passingit progressively to consumers. Subsidies require market monitoring to detect market distortion, while the implement-ing agency must have the capacity to monitorthe target population to determine if the targetbeneficiaries are being reached. There are alsoexit strategy issues. The main obstacle to phas-ing out food subsidies are political resistance aspeople begin to feel entitled, particularly wherethere is concern that the poor will not be able topurchase the staple food at free market prices. Since 2003, the C-Safe Market Assistance Programme has provided milled sorghum tothe working poor via subsidised sale throughsmall retailers in targeted neighbourhoods inselected urban areas in Zimbabwe. It has used'desirability' and geography as the means totarget beneficiaries, e.g. self-selection, as thosewith sufficient income prefer milled corn whereavailable. Support to National Strategic Food Reserves These programmes typically entail the transferof grain by donors to a national strategic grainreserve or food security reserve. The mainobjectives of increasing national strategic grainreserves are to ensure stocks are sufficient forlarge-scale direct distribution in the event of anacute food crisis. This includes lending tohumanitarian agencies to expedite response,and enabling the government to manipulatefood markets by injecting food commoditiesinto those markets. This type of intervention is suited to an urban population that still has access to incometo purchase food. This intervention worksthrough national grain storage and distribu-tions systems, thereby building capacity ratherthan setting up a parallel system. Ethiopia's Emergency Food Security Reserve (EFSR) holds more than 400,000 MT of food as areserve for distribution by the Government orto lend to humanitarian agencies in case ofcrisis. Via a parastatal organisation, theGovernment of Ethiopia began urban distribu-tions of grain in 2008 as price inflationoutstripped the capacity of poor urban dwellersto purchase staple grains. A recent study set out to assess the impact of adopting the World Health Organisation(WHO) growth standards and weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) criterion on theresponse to treatment of severe acutemalnutrition in children compared with theuse of the National Centre for HealthStatistics (NCHS) growth reference. The study used data from children aged 6-59 months with acute malnutrition whowere admitted to the Medecins sansFrontieres (MSF) nutrition programme inMaradi, Niger, during 2006 (N= 56,216).Differences in weight gain, duration oftreatment, recovery from malnutrition,mortality, loss to follow-up and need forinpatient care were compared for severelymalnourished children identified accordingto the NCHS reference and weight-for-height <70% of the median (WHM) criterionversus the WHO standards and the WHZ<-3 criterion. A total of eight times more children (n=25,754) were classified as severelymalnourished according to the WHO stan-dards compared to the NCHS reference(n=2,989). Children included according tothe WHO standards had shorter durationsof treatment, greater rates of recovery, fewerdeaths, and less loss to follow-up or needfor inpatient care. Previous estimates of thechange in the prevalence of severe acutemalnutrition range from increases of 1.5 to2.5 times and 1.7 to 4.2 times, when apply-ing the same WHZ of <-3 to both the NCHSreference and the WHO standards.Differences among estimates are likely because of the criterion used for comparison and willdepend on the age, weight, and height profilesof the population. The authors concluded that the introduction of the WHO standards with the z-score crite-rion to identify children for admission intosevere acute malnutrition treatmentprogrammes would imply the inclusion of chil-dren who are younger but have relativelyhigher weight for height on admissioncompared with the NCHS reference. These chil-dren have fewer medical complications requir-ing inpatient care and are more likely to experi-ence shorter durations of treatment and lowermortality rates. The WHO standards with the z-score crite- rion might become a useful tool for the earlydetection of acute malnutrition in children,although additional research on the resourceimplications of this transition is required.

The 2008 HumanitarianResponse Index (HRI) Report has been releasedby DARA (Development Assistance ResearchAssociates) 2. The top five ranked donors (of good practice, based on Good HumanitarianDonorship) were Sweden, Norway, Denmark,Ireland and the European Commission (EC). TheUS, which is the largest provider of aid byvolume, ranked 15 out of 23. The US was onlyabove average in terms of learning and accounta-bility. The findings from the HRI 2008 point to five key inter-related areas where wealthy countriescan work to improve the quality, effectivenessand impact of humanitarian action: 1) Wealthy countries could do more to strengthen their commitments to provide aid in an impartial,neutral and independent manner, not based on otherpriorities or objectives. The HRI 2008 findings show that donors are not always providing aid in an impartial, neutral andindependent manner, or where it is most needed.Many donors are still biased and influenced byother factors when it comes to allocatingresources. Too many crises around the worldcontinue to be a showcase for poor practice,despite all of the lessons from the past. In manyplaces, humanitarian assistance continues to becompromised by wealthy countries' political,economic, or security agendas, while elsewhereother crises are forgotten and neglected. 2) Wealthy countries should contribute to efforts to improve the quality and use of needs assessments todetermine who needs assistance, where, and of whatkind. The HRI 2008 findings also suggest that there are gaps in the area of needs assessments that shouldbe addressed to ensure that humanitarian assis-tance is provided in accordance with needs. Thefindings show that there are disparities in thequality and consistent use of needs assessments.If humanitarian donorship is truly to be needsbased, donors could contribute to improvingglobal needs assessments tools with clear trans-parent criteria on how to allocate resources atglobal level for a more equitable responsebetween crises. Donors could support theirhumanitarian partners in funding and improvingharmonised needs assessments at the countrylevel. Promoting a continual process of monitor-ing the evolving context and assessing howneeds change, as well as making available thenecessary flexible funding to adapt responsesaccordingly, are also suggested. Donors couldtherefore help promote a more nuanced positionthat balances the need for rapid assessments withthe time needed to engage affected populationsin identifying their evolving needs. 3) Wealthy countries could do much more to harmonise and link relief efforts to early recovery andlonger term development strategies. The HRI 2008 findings confirm a perennial chal- lenge in the humanitarian sector - how better tolink relief to recovery and long term develop-ment, and strengthen the resilience of popula-tions affected by crises. Humanitarian agencies often struggle to find appropriate means toachieve a balance between meeting short termneeds and laying the foundation for recovery anddevelopment. The HRI findings show that somedonor policies and procedures can accentuate thegap between relief, recovery and development,rather than facilitating more integrated andharmonised efforts. Similarly donor procedurescan facilitate or impede efforts to engage effec-tively local communities in defining and imple-menting programmes that meet their needs. 4) Wealthy countries should invest more resources to strengthen the humanitarian system's capacity at alllevels. The HRI 2008 findings indicate that in general, donors could do much more to prioritise capacitybuilding in the humanitarian system as an inte-gral part of their assistance. For example, donorscan do more to fund and prioritise efforts tostrengthen community level and governmentcapacity to reduce risks, and prepare for andrespond to a crisis. At the same time, there is adeficit in donor support for strengthening thecapacity of humanitarian organisations that makeup the system. Without investing in areas such ascontingency planning and standing operationalcapacity, the system will be hard pressed to dealwith the increasing demands placed on it. Donorsneed to approach this issue strategically, andconsider the benefits of investing in building thecapacity of the whole system - not just parts of it- and do so in a holistic way that encouragesharmonisation and coordination among differentlevels. This might include increased support forthe United Nations (UN) humanitarian reformprocess to ensure that it is strengthened andexpanded to include other components of thehumanitarian system - including means to inte-grate more closely with existing capacities at thenational and local level. 5) Wealthy countries should assume more responsibil- ity for ensuring implementation of international stan-dards and good practice, and for improving accounta-bility and performance in humanitarian action. Donors could take a more active leadership role in promoting a shared understanding of goodpractice in humanitarian action. The HRI findingsshow that there is inconsistent application of theinternational laws, principles and standards thatguide and inform effective humanitarian action,especially those that attempt to ensure thatpeople affected by crisis receive the support,protection and assistance they require.Collectively donors need to renew efforts toensure these tools are used consistently, particu-larly in conflict situations, where such laws areoften needed most, but most frequently ignoredby some donors themselves.

Itayi Nkhono of CAS conducts an interview to investigate reasons for default. Gwyneth Cotes, Malawi, 2007 18In response to a food shortage in 2002, Concern Worldwide and ValidInternational piloted a Community-basedTherapeutic Care (CTC) project in two districts in Malawi. The two pilot projects werelargely considered a success based on coverage,community acceptance, and treatmentoutcomes. In 2004, the Malawi Ministry ofHealth (MoH) agreed to expand CTC to addi-tional districts in order to assess differentapproaches to implementing the programme. When a second food shortage occurred in 2005, the MoH encouraged other organisationswanting to contribute to the emergencyresponse to use the CTC approach. Four organ-isations responded, setting up CTCprogrammes in 10 additional districts. At the beginning of 2006, a national stake- holder workshop was held to share experiencesfrom all CTC programmes in Malawi and toreview the evidence in support of scaling upCTC in a non-emergency context. The reviewfound that CTC programmes achieved rates forcure, death, and default that were withinSphere standards and that CTC had the poten-tial to reach more children than the traditionalinpatient therapeutic feeding approach.Although CTC programmes had been solelyimplemented by non-governmental organisa-tions (NGOs) up to that point, the review foundthat there were favourable conditions for scal-ing up CTC nationally, including local produc-tion of Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF)and existing community outreach structures. As a result of this workshop, in April 2006 the MoH publicly confirmed its intention toscale up CTC to all 28 districts in Malawi, andto integrate CTC into the Malawi health systemto make it more sustainable. The Challenge: National Scale-Up Although the MoH had endorsed the scale-upof CTC, a number of challenges were evident.Key among those was the wide variety ofapproaches being used by different organisa-tions, poor communication among stakehold-ers, and a lack of involvement of governmentstaff at the district level. Stakeholders anddonors also had serious concerns about thesustainability of the programme, given the highcost of RUTF. It became clear that a number of things had to happen for CTC to be effectively scaled up inMalawi: 1. A standardised approach, including clear protocols, national guidelines and a moni-toring and evaluation system, was needed across all districts. 2. Extensive technical support and capacity building was needed at the national and district levels to support government staff to take up CTC services and maintain quality . 3. A national system for monitoring and eval- uating nutrition programmes was needed for planning and to ensure the quality of CTC. 4. Coordination and communication among all stakeholders needed to be improved to promote learning and programme effectiveness. 5. Strategic planning and advocacy within the MoH and among partners was required to integrate CTC into the health system func-tionally, in order to ensure future funding and improve cost-effectiveness, and therebymake CTC more sustainable for the govern-ment to manage. MoH has taken on responsibility for collecting CTC programme data, but CAS still supportswith analysis and reporting. Districts that showpoor performance are prioritised for CASsupport. Another achievement is the development of a team of national CTC trainers, along with adraft training manual for CTC. A total of 46health staff from throughout the country hasbeen trained to provide training and technicalsupport on CTC. This is an important step inensuring that the work of CAS can be continuedby the government once the project ends. WhileCAS continues to monitor training quality andmentor the national trainers, all district-leveltrainings are now conducted by MoH staff. Finally, CAS has played an important role in coordinating CTC activities and facilitatingbetter communication among stakeholders. TheCTC Learning Forum, which brings togetherpeople involved in CTC several times a year,has been an effective tool for sharing and repli-cating best practices and lessons learned. Challenges Although a great deal of progress has beenmade over the last two years, there is still muchwork to be done before CTC is fully scaled upand integrated into the health system. There was no initial strategy developed to guide the scale-up process, and as a result scale-up has occurred rapidly and haphazardly.Scale-up and support from CAS has been reac-tive, driven largely by demand from districthealth offices and supporting NGOs. CASrecently developed criteria for prioritisingdistricts for support visits, but no such criteriawere used to guide the scale-up process. CAS iscurrently facilitating the development of anational plan of action for carrying out thework that is remaining, focusing on integratingCTC into the Malawi health system. The planwill include specific actions for achieving theplan, and will specify the roles and responsibil-ities of all stakeholders. From the outset, there has been confusion over the role of CAS. CAS's mandate was notclearly communicated to districts, and initiallysome NGOs did not welcome CAS involvementThe Approach: CTC Advisory Service A recent article on how to achieve wide-spreadchange in global health emphasised that simplyspreading information on the success of a newapproach is not enough to ensure it is scaled-upeffectively. The authors noted that \"Even whenhealth care systems leaders or clinicians becomeaware of a promising innovation, their ability tointroduce it is often severely constrained bylimitations of time, resources, and skill.\" Theauthors concluded that \"most innovative tech-nologies...must be actively, not passively,spread, or they may not spread at all.\" 1 This was certainly the case in Malawi - although the MoH took on primary responsibil-ity for scaling up CTC, it was obvious thatlimited resources, time, staff and expertisewithin the MoH would be a major barrier.Recognizing these limitations, the MoH choseto take an active approach to scaling up CTCand in 2006, formed the CTC Advisory Service(CAS) in partnership with Concern Worldwide. CAS was conceived as a 5-year project, with a team of experienced nutritionand monitoring and evaluation(M&E) officers who act as a tech-nical arm of the Ministry ofHealth's Nutrition Unit to facili-tate the scale-up of CTC, whilebuilding the capacity of thegovernment to take on CTCmanagement. Under a simple Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) withthe government, CAS was giventhe mandate to coordinate, moni-tor, and evaluate CTC activities,provide technical support andcapacity building for CTC at thenational and district level, stan-dardise tools and materials usedfor CTC in the country, andcontinuously advocate for thescale-up and integration of CTCinto the health system. The MoH provides leadership and direction for CAS activities, while Concern Worldwide isresponsible for the day-to-day managementand administration of activities. The project hasbeen funded by several donors, includingUSAID, UNICEF, and Irish Aid. Main achievements In the last two years, CTC has spread morerapidly than was originally expected. SinceCAS began operating, it has provided supportto 25 districts to initiate and carry out CTC. Asof November 2008, 21 districts, out of 28 in thecountry, have started CTC and six more are inthe stages of training or planning. CAS has been instrumental in facilitating the development of national CTC guidelines, alongwith standardised reporting forms and job aids,which have been printed and disseminated toall districts by UNICEF. These tools are nowbeing used by all districts. CAS has also taken the lead on developing a national monitoring and evaluation system.District HMIS (Health ManagementInformation System) officers have been trainedto compile monthly health centre data using anational database that incorporates reportsfrom Outpatient Therapeutic Programmes(OTP), Nutritional Rehabilitation Units (NRU),and supplementary The Berwick, D.M., Journal ofthe American Medical Association, October 24/31, 2007. Vol298, No 16.Field Article Elizabeth Jordan-Bell, Malawi, 2008 Attendees of the 7th CTC Learning Forum practice conducting supervisionat an OTP session. 19in the CTC programmes that they supported. The MOU developed with the Ministry listsgeneral areas where CAS is supposed to takethe lead, but does not specify how roles andresponsibilities should be divided betweenMoH and CAS. Also, CAS is not the onlyagency providing technical support on nutri-tion programmes in Malawi and roles some-times overlap. In particular, there is a need forbetter coordination of programme monitoringand support by CAS, WFP and UNICEF. Supervision of nutrition activities has been a particular challenge due to a lack of time andstaff at the national level, and a consequent lackof accountability at the district level. AlthoughMalawi now has a team of national CTC train-ers, these trainers need ongoing support andmentoring to ensure that they are ready to takeover training and technical support activities. As a result of poor supervision, the quality of service provision remains a problem in manydistricts. Although cure, default, and deathrates have stayed within Sphere standards inmost districts, there are issues with childrenbeing admitted even though they do not meetcriteria, or not being discharged properly. Theshortage of nurses and clinicians in the countrymean that children are frequently not assessedby a clinically trained health worker. Finally, there remain significant obstacles to direct management by the MoH. Among thoseare the cost of RUTF and other supplies and theavailability of human resources. In 2007, about400 MT of RUTF was used for CTCprogrammes in Malawi, costing about 1.6million dollars. This covered 35,724 childrentreated in OTPs and NRUs. However, the priceof locally produced RUTF increased in 2008,and the CTC caseload is expected to rise byabout 30%, once CTC is fully scaled up. Then,the projected cost of RUTF provision alone willbe about 2.6 million dollars a year. There willlikely be a need for external support for thepurchase of RUTF for some time. CTC servicesneed to be better streamlined and incorporatedinto existing health services - such as drugprocurement systems and pre-service training for health staff - to make it affordable for thegovernment to manage. CAS is currently work-ing with the MoH to advocate for inclusion ofRUTF funding into the national SWAp fundingsystem (Sector-Wide Approach). Lessons Learned Having a separate support unit within the MoHto focus on issues of scale-up has been essentialto the rapid progress achieved in Malawi, as thedemands of scaling up generally exceed exist-ing resources. However, there are several thingsthat could be improved on if the approach werereplicated in another country. A clear strategic plan for scaling up and inte- grating CTC into the health system is neededright from the beginning. This plan shouldprioritise districts in order of when they shouldstart CTC, determine how resources will beprocured, and should clarify roles and respon-sibilities of all stakeholders. The terms of reference for the support unit need to be very clear and specific. They shouldlay out how the responsibilities of CTCmanagement will be divided between the MoHand the support unit. Once the agreement isfinalised, the MoH should disseminate theagreement to all district health officers andsupporting NGOs so that they are familiar withthe support unit and know how to accesssupport. In the second year of the project, theCAS unit was provided office space by theMoH, which has led to greater acceptance ofCAS support. It is important that the support unit empha- sises capacity building of local and nationalpartners in all its activities. Although it is ofteneasier and quicker to use NGO resources tomanage and coordinate CTC activities, it is crit-ical that the government is involved in allaspects of the programme right from the begin-ning, to ensure a sustainable handover of theprogramme. District health offices have also expressed a need for better tools and support on planningand budgeting CTC activities. Capacity build-ing needs to focus on issues of logistics, budget-ing, and monitoring and evaluation, not justtraining and technical support. Tools such as astandard budget template and guidance on esti-mating costs and caseloads for CTC would bevery valuable. The CAS approach has been working well in Malawi, despite the challenges, and continuesto refine and improve its approach. Theapproach could be appropriate for other coun-tries wanting to scale up and integrate CTC, butwill need to be adapted. In emergencies, forexample, the rate of scale up may need to beaccelerated and more logistical and staffingsupport provided. In about half of all districts in Malawi, CTC is now managed entirely by the district healthoffice, using the existing health systems. Whilesome issues of quality remain, these districtshave shown that they are capable of managingCTC activities largely on their own, providedthey have initial technical support and training,good ongoing supervision from the nationallevel, and funding support for RUTF and othersupplies.

The workshop brought together universi-ties, training institutions, humanitarianagencies and government staff with thecommon goal of improving training inemergency nutrition in developing coun-tries. The main objectives of the workshopwere to: Create awareness of the new nutrition in emergencies Harmonised Training Package (HTP), developed by NutritionWorks 3under the auspices of the Global Nutrition Cluster (see Box 1). Identify opportunities for the academic accreditation of nutrition in emergenciestraining courses. Explore approaches for better integrating academic training courses with field andon-the-job training and other types of sustainable training initiatives through partnerships. A background paper was presented, as well as country and agency experiences of nutri-tion in emergencies training 4. A key output of the workshop was a consensus statementfor future nutrition in emergencies training(see Box 2). In addition, nine core principles upon which future training in nutrition in emer-gencies is based were also agreed: 1. Prioritising national and regional capacityEmergency nutrition training is required bya number of target groups. The prioritygroup is 'national' staff so that in emer-gency contexts, there are a sufficientnumber of adequately trained staff withemergency nutrition skills who can bequickly and easily deployed. 2. Focus on nutrition literacy 'Nutrition literacy' refers to an understand-ing of nutrition concepts and issues.'Nutrition literacy' is required by a broadrange of actors involved in emergencies,and not confined to nutritionists alone.'Nutrition literacy' needs to be raised at alllevels, from field staff to senior managers. 3. Range of training These will include training, for example, forgraduate and undergraduate students,humanitarian agency staff and governmentstaff. 4. Institutionalisation and accreditation/ certificationIt is important to embed training withinexisting institutions and structures in orderImproving Training inNutrition inEmergencies Summary of workshop report1 Nutrition Works Elizabeth Jordan-Bell, Malawi, 2008 Participants of a CAS-supported training give their feedback aftera practical field session. 20News &Views to sustain initiatives. A system of certification for nutrition in emergency training coursesrecognised by both academic institutions andoperational agencies would help to keep thequality of training high. 5. Practical experience and internships Linking classroom-based learning with practi-cal experience was agreed to be essential inemergency nutrition training. 6. Trainers A cadre of good trainers in nutrition in emer-gencies is essential. Trainers may not necessar-ily be technical experts. However, it will behugely advantageous if trainers have somelevel of practical experience and understand therealities of emergency contexts. 7. Sustainability Many training initiatives have failed in the pastbecause they were not sustained. In some casesthis was due to lack of funding but morecommonly, it was due to a lack of appropriatetrainers on hand to do the training and a lack ofcommitment by participating agencies. Oneway of ensuring financial and political sustain-ability will be through developing businessmodels that are able to ensure adequate incomefrom funding and/or student fees, while main-taining commitment from within the traininginstitution. 8. Advocacy Good advocacy was viewed as the essentialelement to successful nutrition in emergenciestraining. Advocacy is needed at global level,regional and national level. A series of stepsshould be followed to develop a successfuladvocacy plan, the first of which is document-ing the evidence. For example, there is acommon view that there are not enough peoplewith emergency nutrition and related skillsavailable, especially 'national' staff, but therehas been no attempt to document and analysethis gap. An 'audit' of staff that could bedeployed in an emergency with nutrition-related skills would be useful. In addition to thisquantitative evidence, qualitative information,such as case studies of particular emergenciesand real-time evaluations, would be useful inunderstanding where the gaps in capacity are. An urgent need was identified for the creation of a web based searchable register ofstaff with relevant skills. Creation of this regis-ter would also contribute to the audit of the'capacity gap'. This type of analysis fits withinthe Global Nutrition Cluster capacity develop-ment strategy objectives. 9. Evaluation/quality control Evaluating the process and outputs achieved bytraining initiatives will be very important inorder to ensure that the quality achieved isgood enough to meet the needs for professionalcompetence identified by employers andothers.The way forward Global Nutrition Cluster is currently looking at the appropriate institution for hosting an inter-active website for the HTP . Once established,this will provide an ideal opportunity toexpand and obtain feedback on the HTP andinstitutionalise monitoring of the HTP . Specificrecommendations were made by the workshopparticipants in relation to dissemination of theHTP as follows:1.There is a need to translate the HTP if wide spread use is to be achieved. The Global Nutrition Cluster Capacity Development Working Group (CDWG) has committed to translating the HTP into French and Arabic.Portuguese was identified as another priority language. 2.To help ensure widespread use, the HTP needs graphic layout to be completed for allmodules. 3. Some paper copies of the HTP may be needed because of difficulties with internet access and downloading large files. Proposal for a Nutrition in Emergencies Training Network There was discussion around the concept of a Nutrition in Emergencies Training Network(NIETN) and how it would look (See Figure 1).It was suggested that the network was an affili-ation of four key partners encompassinguniversities and training institutions, humani-tarian agencies, government bodies and otherinterested agencies, including the GlobalNutrition Cluster and donors. The overall goalof the network would be to improve training innutrition in emergencies. The network wouldbe managed by a coordinating group thatwould initially be tasked with developing fund-ing proposals to carry out key activities. Aproposal for the Network has been written byNutritionWorks. It is envisaged that in early2009, a first meeting of the network will be heldand proposals will be produced for networkactivities. The HTP was produced over a 1.5 year period by NutritionWorks and a number of authors and is aunique and comprehensive set of materials on nutri-tion in emergencies comprising 21 modules, whichcover different technical areas. The HTP is a packageof training materials but is not a ready to use course.Adaptation is required to create courses targeted atdifferent audiences in different countries. Themodules are designed to be used to develop standalone, focused short courses and comprehensivenutrition in emergencies training courses and canalso be used for advocacy. The HTP has been piloted and evaluated by Valid International and is now in the public domain. It canbe used by any agency or institution. To downloadthe HTP , go to: http://www.humanitarianreform.org,click on Nutrition, and see under 'Nutrition ClusterProducts' .The focus needs to be on improving 'nutrition literacy' ina broad range of professions from nutrition to foodsecurity specialists, and agricultural staff social sectorworkers. \"We're finding it increasingly difficult to recruit goodquality emergency food security and livelihoods peopleand I'm not sure if there are less people with a publicnutrition background out there or whether they don'twant to work for our organisation!\" Humanitarian agency staff member, November 2008Box 1: The Harmonised Training Package (HTP)Figure 1: Proposed structure for the Nutrition in Emergencies Training Network (NIETN) The participants of this workshop agree that: 1.Capacity to respond to nutrition problems arising in emergencies is currently inadequate. 2.There are very few nutrition in emergencies training opportunities, notably in developing countries. 3.There is an imperative to improve nutrition in emergencies training in order to fill the gap in capacity to respond effectively to nutrition problems that arise in emergencies. 4.The harmonised training package (HTP), developed by NutritionWorks under the auspices of the IASC Global Nutrition Cluster, represents a significant step forward in facilitating improved training. The workshop participants encourage its widespread use. 5.There are immediate opportunities to improve nutrition in emergency training at international, regional and national level, using the materials of the HTP , through:a. training networks (such as the Public Health in Complex Emergency network) that can intro-duce emergency nutrition training short courses. b. university nutrition and public health degree courses c. diploma level training run by technical colleges d. in-service training. 6.A new Nutrition in Emergencies Training Network should be formed with the objective of increasing capacity to provide effective response to the nutritional problems arising in emergencies. 7.The Secretariat (contingent on seed funding) will develop a number of concept notes focusing on advocacy, and developing and implementing courses in emergency nutrition training.Box 2: Consensus statement 1The full report is available from: http://www.humanitarianreform.org, click Nutrition 2The workshop was the initiative of the UNICEF-led Global Nutrition Cluster and was organised on their behalf byNutritionWorks, in association with the Centre forInternational Health and Development, University CollegeLondon.

The National Workshop on Infant Feeding in Emergencies (IFE) was held on the 16th and 17thof June 2008 in Colombo, under the auspices ofthe Nutrition Cluster in Sri Lanka in collabora-tion with the Family Health Bureau (FHB). Thetwo day workshop consisted of a series ofpresentations, each with questions and answersopportunities and panel discussions. The work-shop focused on developing an understanding ofthe importance of IFE. The specific objectiveswere to understand why IFE is important inemergencies, appreciate the advantages ofbreastfeeding and the risks of artificial feedingand how best to protect and support safe andappropriate IFE. The workshop was attended by 35 partici- pants from United Nations (UN) agencies, proj-ect coordinators from international non-govern-mental organisations (NGOs), District MedicalOfficers and Medical officers from the Maternaland Child Health (MCH) Unit. The workshop started with a welcome address from the Director of MCH, the FHB andUNICEF. The first day consisted of four presen-tations and group work. Dr. SM Hossain(UNICEF Sri Lanka) opened the workshop andintroduced the importance of IFE, theOperational Guidance on IFE and theInternational Code of Marketing of BreastmilkSubstitutes. Dr. Anoma Jayatilake gave a verycomprehensive account on breastfeeding andappropriate counselling skills and Dr. RenukaJayatissa gave a brief overview on rapid assess-ments. After each presentation, workshop partic-ipants were given practice exercises to test theirgrasp of the topic just covered - all showed agood understanding. The emphasis on the second day of the work- shop was sharing the experiences of the Bali IFEworkshop , presented by Dr. Renuka Jayatissa.She concluded her report by sharing the pledgefor action issued by the workshop participants topromote, protect and support breastfeedingduring emergencies, to prevent the inappropriateuse of breast-milk substitutes and to supportinfant and young child feeding in general. Dr. Lalith Chadradasa followed with a presen- tation on IFE media exposure in emergencies. Heexplained that the media can play a major role inemergencies - not only in highlighting problemsbut also providing an opportunity for interven-tion through communication. However, often themedia delivers the wrong messages duringemergencies, either because the mediawriter/source is ignorant of the issues or thereceiver misunderstands the information or hasmisconceptions around IFE. The final presentation of the workshop was on preventing and controlling micronutrient defi-ciencies in populations affected by emergencies, by Ms.Vishaka Thilakeratne. The major deficien-cies include Vitamin A, Iron, Zinc and Iodine.She emphasised that in order to meet themicronutrient requirements during emergencies,foods fortified with micronutrients should beprovided, e.g. corn-soya blend, biscuits,vegetable oil enriched with vitamin A, andiodised salt. It was pointed out that these foodsmust be appropriately fortified, taking intoaccount that other unfortified foods will meet ashare of micronutrient needs. It was also high-lighted that fortified foods may not meet therequirements of pregnant women, lactatingwomen and young children. In these cases,supplementation is warranted and UNICEF andthe World Health Organisation (WHO) havedeveloped a daily multiple micronutrientformula to meet the recommended nutrientintake (RNI). Ms. Thilakaratne elaborated on micronutrient supplementation programmes in the context ofSri Lanka, where a supplementation programmeis already in place for mothers and young chil-dren. She considered the current increase in foodprices would have an impact on nutritionalstatus and considered it timely to intervene withsupplementation. She concluded by emphasisingthat supplementation should not be a long termintervention strategy. The participants then broke up into groups and were asked to consider two scenarios:Aftermath of the Pakistan earthquake andRefugees in Tanzania. The four groups weretasked to select the criteria they would use toidentify best practices and then select best prac-tice interventions. The final item of the workshop was the draft- ing of a national policy on IFE (modelled on aprocess used at the Bali workshop to generate aJoint Statement), which was facilitated by DrsShudharshini Fernandopulle and S.M Hossain.Inputs were received from participants and itwas agreed that during emergencies, the keyareas to concentrate on are to protect, promoteand support breastfeeding, to prevent donationsof breastmilk substitutes and powdered milks, toensure availability of age appropriate comple-mentary foods and supplements and in onlyexceptional circumstances, support replace-ment/artificial feeding. Following the work-shop, the national policy directive to Supportand Ensure Appropriate and Adequate InfantFeeding during Emergencies was finalised and ispending approval by the Director General ofHealth Services, Ministry of Health Care andNutrition, Government of Sri Lanka. The wholeworkshop was facilitated and coordinated by Dr.Sudharshini Fernandopulle from MoH FHB,who attended the regional IFE workshop in Balito represent the Government of Sri Lanka.

The aim of the forum is to enable field prac- titioners to have access to prompt technicaladvice for operational challenges for whichanswers are not readily accessible incurrent guidelines. en-net has been devel-oped at the request of many agencies andindividuals and hopes to build on the expe-riences of earlier fora such as NGONut andNutritionNet. A simple online interface has been devel- oped where users can submit questions orcontribute to the answers to questionsposed by others. Questions and answershave been organised into seven thematicareas:prevention and treatment of severe acute malnutrition prevention and treatment of moderate acute malnutrition assessment infant and young child feeding inter- ventions general food distribution livelihood interventions (including cash) humanitarian systems A panel of technical moderators has been created, each assigned to their expert'theme' .

The general objectives of the meeting were: i) to identify areas of consensus on the nutrient needs and dietary management of moderate malnutrition (MM) in childr en that can be translated into evidence-based global guidelines and ii) to identify knowledge gaps that should be addr essed by research, both in the area of dietary management and the modal- ities for providing that diet. Moderate malnutrition (or moderate wast- ing) includes all childr en with a weight-for - height between -3 and -2 z-scor esc. Moderate stunting is defined by a height-for -age between -3 and -2 z-scor es. Most of these childr en will be moderately underweight (weight-for-age between -3 and -2 z-scor es). Four background papers were commis- sioned by the WHO in advance of the meeting and circulated among participants. Presentations of these and other papers were followed by discussions and working group sessions to develop consensus statements and identify areas for research on the impr oved dietary management of MM. Nutrient requirements of moderately malnourished children A backgr ound paper (prepar ed by Prof Mike Golden, Emeritus Professor, Aberdeen University) provided tentative recommenda- tions for diets suitable for feeding MM childr en. Nigel Rollins's (WHO) presentation on manag- ing the needs of HIV-infected childr en empha- sised how little is known about the r elationship between HIV and MM in infected childr en and how there is currently no basis for recommend- ing different nutritional management, apart from increased ener gy intake, compar ed to non-HIV infected childr presentation by Mark Manary (St. Louis Childr en's Hospital) on recent attempts to supplement the diet of MM childr en to prevent kwashiorkor in Malawi, highlighted the lack of an evidence base to make specific recommendations for the dietary management of MM childr en in areas of high kwashiorkor prevalence. Consensus statements The nutritional requir ements of moderately malnourished childr en probably fall some- wher e between the nutritional requir ements for healthy childr en and those of childr en with sever e acute malnutrition during the catch up growth phase. The nutrient intakes of moderately malnourished childr en need to be adequate to allow wasted childr en to synthesise the lean tissue deficits and to allow stunted childr en to achieve both accelerated linear growth and associated accrual of lean tissue. Diets with a nutrient density equivalent to F100 and a low anti-nutrient content, provided at an ener gy intake to support the desir ed rate of weight gain, are adequate to promote height and weight gain. Such diets may also be effective at restoring functional outcomes, including physiological and immunological function towar ds normal, in moderately wasted childr en. Ther e is evidence that growth deficits can be treated (i.e. that catch up growth for height can occur) in childr en far beyond two years of age, and even in adolescents, provided that a high quality diet is sustained.Though there is no evidence of similarrecovery of other deficits associated with stunting, such as cognitive deficits. However , the prevention of stunting should always be directed at the 'window of opportunity' from conception to the first 24 months of life, when most growth faltering occurs and impacts on health and brain development are greatest. Proteins used to feed moderately malnour - ished childr en should have a PDCAAS of at least 70%. Giving lower amounts of proteins with higher PDCAASdmay be advantageous. The diets of childr en recovering from moderate wasting should provide at least 30% of their ener gy as fat. A higher percent- age of ener gy derived from fat (35 to 45 %) might have advantages provided the density of nutrients is adequate. It is recommended that diets for moderately malnourished childr en contain at least 4.5% of their total ener gy content from n-6 polyunsaturated of their total ener gy content from n-3 PUFA. It is advised that the ratio of linoleic/_-linolenic acid remains in the range of 5-15. A ratio within the range of 5- 9, however , may be preferable. When large quantities of nutrients known to have an effect on acid-base metabolism are added to foods, their potential effect on the acid-base balance of the body after being ab- sorbed and metabolised should be estimated. Their overall effect should remain neutral. Ener gy needs of moderately malnourished HIV-infected childr en are by 20- 30% compar ed to non HIV-infected childr en who are growing well. Ther e is no evidence for an increased protein requir ement in relation to ener gy, i.e. 10-15% total ener gy intake is sufficient. Resear ch needs It is unclear whether a diet adequate for treat- ing a moderately wasted child will also be adequate to treat a stunted child. The length of time requir ed for catch up growth is also not known. Further studies are needed to clarify the effect of the diet on the timing of linear growth in relation to weight gain. Resear ch is also needed on safe upper limits of different nutrients at different ages, as well as the requir ements and importance of specific and often 'forgotten' nutrients like potassium, sulfur , phosphor us and selenium. More field friendly techniques (like blood spot technology) for assessing deficiency of certain Type I nutrients are needed. Resear ch is requir ed to understand better the pathophysiology of how HIV causes under - nutrition, how HIV-related undernutrition differs from undernutrition due to other causes and how to distinguish between the different aetiologies. Fundamental research is needed to obtain a better understanding of the pathophysiology of kwashiorkor . Curr ently , none of the proposed mechanisms for how kwashiorkor develops are supported by strong evidence that can be trans- lated into preventive programming. Foods and ingredients suitable for use in moderately malnourished children A backgr ound paper (prepar ed by Prof Kim Michaelsen and colleagues from the University of Copenhagen, and Prof Tsinuel Girma, from the University of Jimma, Ethiopia) provided anWHO/UNICEF/WFP/UNHCR informal consultation on moderate malnutrition management in U5's Summary of meetinga 1WHO (2008).

Consensus statements The addition of animal source foods to a plant-based diet promotes the recovery of moderately malnourished children. Diets based exclusively on plant foods need to be fortified and processed in such a way to remove anti-nutrients. Diets with low anti-nutrient and fibre content are beneficial for promoting the recovery of malnourished children. Phytate may seriously limit the efficacy of plant based foods. The possibility of safely reducing its content by the use of phytase and/or food processing should be explored. Highly refined cereal flours (those with low extraction rates) have lower levels of anti-nutrients and dietary fibre than less refined flours. Highly refined flours cost more and have lower vitamin and mineral levels - although these vitamins and minerals are more bioavailable. Blended flours prepared with de-hulled legumes are preferable to those prepared with whole legume flour. Food processing techniques, including home -based processing techniques such as ferm- entation and soaking, can improve food quality, specifically nutrient bioavailability. The effect of anti-nutrients in complemen-tary foods based on the family diet can be decreased by various traditional food processing methods such as malting or soaking. The feasibility and efficacy of theseprocessing techniques for the management of moderate malnutrition should be assessed. The energy density of semi-solid foods can be increased by reducing the water content or by adding fat or sugar. Adding fat and sugar, however, decreases the nutrient density in relation to energy and is acceptable only if the overall density of each and every essential nutrient is sustained at a level that supports normal balanced tissue synthesis. The increase in viscosity resulting from the reduced water content can be limited by using amylase or amylase rich flours. Foods with a high energy density often have a high renal solute load and may not provideenough water for recovering children. Children fed diets with a high solute load in relation to their water content may need additional water during and between meals.Breastfeeding provides large quantities of water in addition to a full range of nutri-ents. It has a low solute load and should always be encouraged before potable water when energy dense foods are provided. As most diets in poor countries have a low level of n-3 (omega-3) fatty acids and an inappropriately high ratio of n-6 fatty acids in relation to the n-3 fatty acids, foods with high n-3 fatty acid content should be promoted. These include soybean and rapeseed oil, and fatty fish or its products. This is especially important for non breastfed children. Research needs There is uncertainty about the minimum quan-tity or type of animal source foods that areneeded in the diets of MM children. Milk, andpotentially eggs, seem to have advantages overmeat and fish in terms of growth, but not interms of improving micronutrient status. It isunclear whether children who are stunted butnot wasted may benefit from different propor-tions of animal v plant protein in their diets, ascompared to diets designed to treat wasting. Research is also needed to assess whether dairy/ whey stimulates linear growth and / orreverses wasting in comparison to plant basedfoods (e.g. soy) with a high PDCAAS, lowlevels of anti-nutrients and low fibre content inmalnourished children. The extent to whichcooking/heat treatment denatures bioactivecomponents of dairy products should also beinvestigated. Data are needed on the maximum acceptable levels of intake of the most important anti-nutrients and of different types of fibres for MMchildren. There is also a need to establish upperacceptable limits for sodium and iron content offoods for MM children. Dietary counselling for moderately malnourished children This background paper (prepared by Prof Ann Ashworth, London School of Hygiene andTropical Medicine) concluded that mothers ofMM children are usually given the samegeneral dietary advice as mothers of well-nour-ished children. The paper suggests that genericdietary recommendations developed by theWHO and Food and Agricultural Organisation(FAO) for well-nourished children may meetrequirements of MM children if the recommen-dations are made more specific and contextappropriate. To date, there have been few studies of the efficacy of dietary counselling in treating MM.Studies looking at dietary counselling for MMreport very different weight gains. Little infor-mation is available on other outcomes. Evenheight gains are rarely reported. Differences in reported weight gain are probably due to differ-ences in initial nutritional status (stunted vswasted). It was noted that one of the most effec-tive pilot nutrition counselling programmesimplemented in Bangladesh provided micronu-trient supplements that may have increased itsefficacy. Save the Children US presented datashowing that large scale positive devianceprogrammes in Vietnam and other countrieshave not had a significant impact on reducingMM. Consensus Statements Dietary counselling for the prevention and management of malnutrition in general is often weak or absent and should be strengthened for all caregivers, especially those of children aged less than 24 months. Dietary counselling, breastfeeding coun selling and improving feeding practices should always be part of the management of MM. This is essential even when food supplements are given. Formative research should always be carried out before formulating dietary recommendations. Only foods and feeding practices that are affordable, feasible and acceptable to families should be recom-mended. Where prior assessment indicates that it is not possible to provide all nutrients needed by the child using the accessible family foods, other approaches, (including the use of fortified foods, food supplements, or micronutrient supplements) should be recommended. Research needs One of the key research questions is whether toalways to aim to maximise the rate of catch-upin wasted children and what the most appropri-ate delivery channels for dietary counsellingare. Research into the effectiveness of a combi-nation of approaches for addressing MM is alsoneeded, e.g. infection control and nutritionalsupport and the combined and separate impactof food supplements and dietary counselling. In order to inform this research agenda, researchers need to report weight gain asg/kg/d (as well as % moving between differentweight-for-height and height-for-age cate-gories), disaggregate weight gain amongwasted and and broadenthe number of outcomes (e.g. body composi-tion, height gain, immune function, morbidity).Overall, we need a better understanding of howto provide and deliver effective dietary coun-selling. Food supplements used to treat moderate malnutrition in children This background paper (prepared by Dr Saskia de Pee and Dr Martin Bloem, WFP) reviewedspecialised food supplements that are currentlyused to treat MM children in different contexts.This includes fortified blended foods preparedwith cereals and legumes as major ingredients,complementary food supplements providingnutrients and energy missing in the family diet,and micronutrient powders. Dr de Pee and Dr Bloem reiterated that most supplementary feeding programmes (SFPs) formoderately malnourished children supplyfortified blended foods (FBFs), such as corn soyblend (CSB) and wheat soy blend (WSB), inNews &Views Saskia de Pee/WFP Local production of foritfied blended food25combination with oil and sugar. However, there are a number of shortcomings with FBFs suchthat they are not optimal for feeding moder-ately malnourished children and need to beimproved and/or replaced by foods that bettermeet their nutritional needs. Presentations from WFP , UNICEF and USAID described the various improvementsthe agencies all plan to make to their fortifiedblended flour products, e.g. increasing theenergy density, adding dairy products,dehulling soybeans, possibly removing cerealgerm, changing the proportion of energy fromfat, improving the EFA and micronutrientprofiles. Improvements and adaptations to lipid- based nutrient supplements (LNS) and ready-to-use foods (RUFs) are also being made by themembers of the LNS Research Network(supported by grants from the Bill and MelindaGates Foundation and with support of theUSAID- funded FANTA-2 Project) and ValidInternational. Papers on field research from Malawi (Prof Ken Maleta, Blantyre College of Medicine),China (Prof Chen Chunming, International Niger and Sierra Leone (DrSusan Shepherd, MSF-Nutrition WorkingGroup) and Ghana (Prof Kathryn Dewey,University of California, Davis) presented dataon the impact and outcomes of usingspecialised products to treat and prevent MM indifferent contexts. For example, in Malawi,supplementary feeding of milk/peanut andsoy/peanut fortified spreads to treat moder-ately wasted children resulted in slightly higherrecovery rates than feeding with CSB. In Niger,a targeted MSF supplementary feedingprogramme for moderately wasted childrenusing RUF had a 95% recovery rate. In SierraLeone, soy peanut fortified spread resulted inhigher weight gain and shorter treatment thanpremix CSB-oil. Consensus statements There is an urgent need to develop clear terminology for the different specialised foods used to treat moderate malnutrition. When it is expected that a new food product will have at least equal impact on growth, morbidity and micronutrient status compared to an existing product (often a FBF such as CSB or WSB), then it is permis-sible to use this product in programmes for feeding moderately malnourished children provided that the product is acceptable to the beneficiaries. In that case, it is importantto collect programme data to monitor the impact of this new product on the time needed for recovery of MM children, when the product is used for treatment, or on the occurrence of new cases of malnutrition if itis used for prevention. Concurrently, the efficacy of the new product should also be assessed under carefully controlled circumstances in the same or another area or coun-try, depending on local possibilities. Such efficacy testing should include measures of physiological, immunological, cognitive andbody compositional recovery as well as simple weight gain. It is very likely that different types of specialised foods and programme formats (e.g. blanket or targeted, dietary counselling) will be used to treat, or prevent, moderate malnutrition in the future, depending on the context (security, preva-lence of malnutrition, general food security conditions, etc). The next WHO meeting on moderate malnutrition, which will focus on programming issues, should endeavour to develop algorithms for determining what programme type and product to use in different situations. Research needs Areas of uncertainty still exist with respect toimproving FBFs. These include: the impact ofdehulling and degerming andwheat, addition of phytase and/or amylase toimprove nutrient availability and food accept-ability, maximum tolerable fibre content, theminimal quantity of energy provided by fat toensure adequate energy intake, theamount/proportion of milk required in theformula, the possibility and efficacy of usingplant protein isolates, especially soy proteinisolates, as a possible substitute for dairy prod-ucts. There is also a question regarding whetherthe anti-nutrient content of FBFs can be signifi-cantly reduced by encouraging farmers toproduce crop types that have naturally lowerconcentrations of anti-nutrients. Agencies urgently need to collect impact assessment data from the different products(FBF, RUF, LNS, micronutrient powders) beingused to treat and prevent MM in differentcontexts so that field agencies/governmentsknow which product to use in a given context. The impact and outcome data for new prod- ucts need to be comparable across studies andprogramme evaluation. Information on non-food context factors should also be collected(e.g. programme incentives). The operationaladvantages of some products/programmetypes should be recorded (e.g. blanket distribu-tions may be easier in food insecure areas). It is essential to collect information on the costs of providing different types of specialisedproducts, complementary interventions, andthe means of distribution. Recommendations of the meeting - Next steps The meeting made a number of recommenda- tions to move forward and to continue toimprove current programmes in the next fewyears. Establishment of a process to develop specifi- cations for food categories for moderatelymalnourished children and validation of newproducts for prevention and treatment ofmoderate malnutrition in children.Dr. Carlos Navarro-Colorado (EmergencyNutrition Network) presented a description of ageneric approach to validate the efficacy of newfoods for moderate malnutrition. This wouldneed to be based upon clear classification ofdifferent types of food supplements requiredand the nutrient specifications for each categoryof food supplement. Four stages of validationwere proposed: (i) analysis of composition andprocessing, (ii) small scale clinical pilot, (iii)field efficacy trial, and (iv) post-validationmonitoring. It would not be necessary toconduct all four stages for all products. The design of studies and validation of prod- ucts will face a number of challenges. Theseinclude lack of baseline dietary information,accounting for differences in the quality ofprogramme implementation, the need tobroaden and define outcome indicators beyond anthropometry, and accounting for the fact thatan unknown proportion of moderatelymalnourished children will recover sponta-neously. Another significant challenge will behow to establish an institutional mechanismand identify a lead agency for ensuring coordi-nated validation of products. A working group then examined how to move forward and to set up a process ofimproving existing food supplements andensure their efficacy is adequately evaluated. Consensus statements A standing task force should be established and led by WHO with appropriate UN agencies and other technical experts to develop specifications for specialised prod-ucts, in particular for moderately wasted children, in a first step. A separate expert group should be estab- lished to examine different endogenous foodcomponents that have potential negative effects and develop upper limits for these anti-nutrients and toxins. One of the tasks of this group would be to determine the maximum acceptable level of different typesof dietary fibres and other potentially dele-terious natural constituents that can be present in food supplements. There is a need for an independent standing working group to assist national govern-ments and agencies to determine if newly available products that are put onto the market are appropriate and whether (a) particular type(s) of product testing are required before granting approval for their use among specific target groups. The meeting recommended that this set of activities should be initiated within the nextsix months. Research Needs In the discussions, the meeting also identifiedthe need to estimate the level at which recoveryfrom moderate malnutrition occurs in absenceof supplementation so that this can beaccounted for in trials involving new products.This can be achieved either by examining datafrom previous studies where some children didnot receive any supplement or by taking as thecontrol group in intervention studies a groupreceiving adequate dietary counselling but nofood supplement. There is also a need to elaborate specific non- anthropometric measures that can be used tocompare outcomes and product efficacy. Thiswill involve developing and strengthening fieldfriendly techniques for measuring outcomessuch as body composition, immunocompe-tence, micronutrient status, renal concentratingability, physical activity level, sodium pumpfunction, intellectual development, etc. Organisation of a second meeting on improving programmes addressing themanagement of moderate malnutritionThe focus of this technical meeting was dietaryrequirements of MM children, so that program-matic issues were not substantively addressed.The WHO is planning a further technical meet-ing on programming for MM children.

The Sphere handbook forms akey tool of the project and has become oneof the most recognised tools for improvinghumanitarian response for NGOs, UnitedNations (UN) agencies, donor governmentsand other actors. The first edition of the handbook was published in 2000, and then following arevision was republished in 2004. Since thelast revision, significant changes havetaken place in the humanitarian sector -especially with regard to technical andcross cutting issues and humanitarianreform. There have been considerabledevelopments and change in the field ofnutrition in terms of the prevention andtreatment of malnutrition and how it isdefined. Sphere revision underway For this reason, the handbook is now under-going revision to produce an updated versionby 2010.

Methodology The research methodology was based on social marketing techniques5, i.e. using commercial marketing techniques to address social orpublic health challenges. According to the liter-ature 6, there are important differences between social and commercial marketing approaches. Commercial marketing seeks to persuade people to purchase specific goods or services, whereas social marketing prioritises and seeks the well being of indi- viduals and of society. In the latter case, needs are not artificially created. The research methodology was validated by market- ing specialists from Ferrero7, France. Qualitative and quantitative questionnaires were administered to moth- ers and children in low-income urban neigh-bourhoods and in Niamey's suburban ruralvillages. A random sample of 80 people partic-ipated in the questionnaire surveys and a totalof 144 adults and 382 children participated inthe organoleptic tests held in Niamey and onerural village. The study comprised four phases, with each phase lasting 6-8 months. An assessment wasmade at the end of each phase before movingon to the next one. The four were:Phase 1: Market study and evaluation of needand feasibility.Phase 2: Establishing the marketing mix (prod-uct, price, distribution and communicationmechanisms). Phase 3: Optimising the marketing mix and vali-dation (this includes industrial production).This article shares some experiences of the company, Nutriset, in applying a socialmarketing approach to assess the affordabilityof a micronutrient supplement for 1-5 year oldsto low income mothers in Niamey, Niger. This article presents the first results of a feasibility study (part of ongoingresearch) conducted byNutriset 1and its partner STA2, in Niamey, Niger, since May 2006. Niger waschosen as the pilot countrysince it is one of the poor-est and least developedcountries in the world 3. Here, 1,120,000 childrenbetween the ages of 1 and 5years are at risk of malnutri-tion 4and 50,000 of these children live in Niamey. Moreover, Nigerpresented favourable political, economic,social, technological, environmental and legal(PESTEL) conditions for setting up the project. The objective of this study was to determine if the distribution of a nutritional supplementfor vulnerable low-income populations inurban Niger was viable. Social marketing tech-niques were applied throughout the project togather qualitative and quantitative data and toevaluate the sustainability of such an approachto prevent malnutrition among at-risk popula-tions. The nutritional supplement is manufac-tured locally by STA. It is hoped that throughlocal production, nutritional capacity develop-ment will increase. If Nutriset's social market-ing experience in Niger is positive, the method-ology may be used to develop similar projectsin other developing countries. Nutriset, Niamey, Mali, 2006 Participants in the organoleptic study.28Field Article Price setting was the most challenging part of the marketing mix. The product had to beaffordable and at the same time not displaceother foods normally consumed in the diet. Thecalculation was based on the fact that on aver-age the daily dietary expenses of low incomefamilies are about 250 CFA franc 9per person. Data gathered in the field in 2007 showed that over a two week period, the target popula-tion of Niamey (less well off) are able to spendabout 200 CFA franc (0.3\u20ac) to complement thediets of their children. With this in mind, 200CFA franc (0.3\u20ac)/70g pot and 350 CFA franc(0.52\u20ac)/140g pot of Grandibien, was consid-ered to be affordable. Both are fixed prices andretailers are regularly checked to ensure thatthey are selling at these prices. These retailprices just about cover the industrial costs ofproduction but cannot absorb the othermarketing costs associated with the productlaunch (e.g. communication, distribution, etc.)that are currently covered by Nutriset. Afterlaunch, the costs should be covered bysales volume. At present, Grandibien is distributed by pharmaceutical wholesalers and by41 groceries in Niamey. The distributionchannel is about to be extended toinclude grocery wholesalers, a networkof motorcycle delivery men, women'sgroups recruited through health carecentres and micro-credit organisations. The public information campaign focuses on explaining the use and thebenefits of Grandibien. Radio and televi-sion appear to be effective media forpublicising the product. An instructiveTV advertisement that had previouslybeen tested on mothers was made by aNiger agency in the three main locallanguages. Mothers, health workers, midwives, and community leaders are directlyinformed through meetings organised inhealth care c entres. Mothers are also informed by retailers who have partici-pated in training on the product. Although a further study (to be conducted in early 2009) is needed toincrease understanding of the profile ofthe populations currently consuming'Grandibien', the product has beenmarketed and distributed mainly inpoor areas of Niamey. It is stocked inshops that are located close to the healthcare centres (initially the product wassold at the health centres with the autho-eracy, simple graphic messages are used to advertise and promote the product. The graph-ics were designed by ZigZag 8and tested by a selection of mothers. Table 1: Example of the cost of a daily menu in the target population (per person) Purchased food Paid price Morning Local flat cakes madeof puff pastry, ordoughnuts. 50 CFA franc(0.075\u20ac) Noon Rice with plain sauce 100 CFA franc(0.15\u20ac) Evening Millet balls with sauce 100 CFA franc(0.15\u20ac)risation of the Ministry, but this caused confu- sion as treatments for children under five athealth centres are free.) Also the product is soldby women in those areas (i.e. women whochoose to make the distribution of Grandibientheir money-making/small business activity).It is therefore expected that, in the main, thoseconsuming Grandibien are from the poorestsections of society. Evaluation and lessons learnt In February 2008, 172 mothers with children inthe target age range were interviewed to evalu-ate their views on Grandibien. Of these, 92mothers had bought Grandibien and 80 moth-ers had not. Ninety eight per cent of motherswho had bought Grandibien were satisfiedwith the product, while the 'loyalty index' ofpeople who had bought the product was 68%.Surprisingly, over 67 % declared thatGrandibien had improved the appetite of theirchildren. However, only 14.3% stated thatGrandibien brought extra vitamins and miner-als to their children, while 13.1% said thatGrandibien gave energy to their children. Positive findings included: The social marketing methodology used in Niger can easily be adapted to new projects. Ferrero considered that the survey results clearly demonstrated a successful and coherent marketing approach. Families appreciated participating in the survey and having the opportunity to express what they thought. The interviews and surveys provided practical and usable information. Mothers became increasingly aware of the benefits of nutriti on supplementation. Limitations of the study included: The territory covered by the feasibility study (Niamey's urban territory) is not representative of Niger's rural society. Local dialects may constitute a communica- tion barrier. Having the support of local health care agents and of the Niger Ministry of Health was a key factor in the development of the project. However, administrative procedurestake a long time and led to delays in the project schedule. Sustainability is a key challenge for this type of initiative. Sale price must cover direct and indi-rect costs if the product is to be manufacturedlocally. Nutriset has financed the setting up ofthe distribution network, training and the largeawareness communication campaign. Thisexpenditure has been vital for kick-starting theprocess. The product is now well known andwidely distributed in Niamey. Promotionexpenditures will therefore decrease signifi-cantly and distribution costs should beabsorbed by sales volumes. Establishingsustainable local level production capacity willhelp build in-country nutritional autonomy. Atthe producer level, this will also help balancethe financial risks of manufacturing nutritionalproducts for humanitarian programmes. A follow up study is being planned for the start of 2009. This study will have a number ofobjectives: To determine the proportion of the target population that is consuming the product and their socio-economic profile. To determine the nutritional impact of Grandibien at individual and population level. To determine whether and how the productdisplaces other family expenditures. Nutriset plan to make the product more widely available, especially to rural peoplewith lower purchasing power. To thisend, Nutriset are exploring the potentialfor selling a daily quantity ofGrandibien and will conduct tests inNiamey city and the suburbs withdistribution partners (such as womengroups and shopkeepers) over a threemonth period, starting from April 2009.With new packaging, the productshould be more affordable for localproducers. Nutriset are also planning toinvolve non-governmental organisa-tions (NGOs) in distribution and train-ing in the future, especially in rural andremoter areas. Conclusions Today Grandibien is well known andcorrectly distributed in Niamey.Mothers value the product, are aware ofits beneficial effects on children andregularly purchase it. The scaling-up ofdistribution outside of Niamey iscurrently being considered and evalu-ated. If it goes ahead it will probably beorganised through existing distributionchannels and in collaboration withhealth centres and local organisations.

The cyclone also killed livestock anddestroyed crops, farming equipment, and fish-ing boats. Planning for the emergency wasalready well underway before the cyclone hitland. Early warning systems and disasterpreparedness measures allowed a reported 3million people to evacuate low-lying coastalareas and local government officials and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) rapidly tomove contingency stocks from neighbouringdistricts into the areas of anticipated impact.Following the cyclone's landfall, the govern-ment, armed forces, local civil society organisa-tions and volunteers moved quickly to mountsearch and rescue operations and to distributefood, water, logging and other emergency itemsto survivors. The reduced death toll comparedto previous cyclones is a testament to improvedcommunity preparedness measures and a creditto the 43,000 volunteers working under thegovernment funded Cyclone PreparednessProgramme. While the immediate response to the disaster was both prompt and vigorous, Oxfam believesthat some actors could and should have donemore effectively to meet emergency needs.While coordination at local level was reasonablyeffective, gaps were visible in coordinationbetween local and national actors, resulting inpoor quality humanitarian response. Since fieldbased staff and officials within national NGOsand institutions were rarely empowered tomake programmatic and policy decisions - forexample, regarding numbers of households totarget or types of items to distribute - large partsof the response remained resource-driven and'top-down', rather than needs based. Above all, coordination at both the national and local level appears to have been hamperedby a lack of strategic focus. While the informalactivation of the United Nations (UN) 'clusterapproach' to humanitarian coordination didallow those involved in the response to meetmore regularly at Dhaka level, the clustersthemselves were not utilised by either thegovernment or UN agencies as a space forgenuine policy discussions around actual needson the ground. With regard to the UN system,the absence of a clearly identifiable, inclusiveinter-agency coordination forum, as well as adedicated Humanitarian Coordinator (HC) orother high-level UN official, also resulted inmissed opportunities in terms of joint planningand preparedness. Cross-cutting issues like gender and protec- tion appear to have fallen through the cracks asclusters were limited to discussing the moretechnical and practical aspects of the response. Many multilateral and bilateral donors gave generously during the first phase of theresponse but struggled to coordinate assistanceboth with each other and with government. In part, this appears to be the result of the poorsharing of information and a lack of establishedcommunication channels between donorsbelonging to the Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development's DevelopmentAssistance Committee (OECD-DEC) and othercountries who fall outside this group.Government officials and Dhaka-based donorsappear to have had little or no information onthe timeframe within which substantial bilateralpledges were being spent or which activitiesthey were funding. Targeting the right people for relief was another major challenge in the emergencyresponse. Relief distributions did not alwaysbenefit the most vulnerable, such as female andchild-headed households or elderly anddisabled people. In part this may have been theresult of people's needs outstripping availableresources. However, due to the information gapbetween national policy-makers and field staff,those leading the response did not pick up onadditional needs early enough to allow donorsto respond with more assistance. In light offinancial and material constraints, NGOs deliv-ering the assistance often found it difficult toselect beneficiaries. This seems to have been aparticular challenge for NGOs who had previ-ously carried out development work in the samevillages. A strong developmental approachmeant that staff sometimes struggled to developand explain to communities the new selectioncriteria required for an equitable emergencyresponse. Considering the fact that the vast majority of assistance programmes in Bangladesh areimplemented by local actors, internationaldonors and aid agencies have not investedadequately in strengthening these frontlineresponders in disaster-prone areas. More effortsare needed to build these organisations' capac-ity, especially in terms of beneficiary selection,the application of international quality stan-dards such as Sphere standards and effectivecontingency planning. In terms of recovery there are still two massive gaps - the repair and reconstruction ofhomes and the rehabilitation of people's liveli-hoods. Nearly 1.5 million homes were destroyed or damaged due to the cyclone and subsequentstorm surge. Damage assessments estimates are800 million dollars. To its credit, the governmentof Bangladesh acted immediately after the disas-ter to provide families whose homes were fullydestroyed in the worst affected areas with a one-off housing grant. Carried out with remarkablespeed and efficiency, this distribution proved tobe an innovative way of supporting extremelyvulnerable families. It was clear, however, thatthe amount was insufficient to allow families to actually rebuild their homes. Most people inter-viewed by Oxfam reported having spent theircash on other emergency needs, such as foods orwinter clothing for children, as well as tosupport recovery of livelihoods. The cyclone killed over 1.2 million livestock and destroyed nearly 2.5 million acres of crops.Damage and losses were estimated at 500million dollars, with large numbers of commu-nities that were previously reliant on agricul-ture, fishing and casual labour having lost boththeir incomes and assets. Food security needswere significant. The World Food Programme(WFP) led the food security cluster in calling forrelief distributions to continue for more than 2.2million people until at least May 2008. However,Oxfam feel that the clusters, by not advocatingfor more seed distribution, missed an opportu-nity for improving some people's food security.Also, the fact that 95% of local markets func-tioned again suggested that some cash-basedresponses may have been appropriate. Loans and credit are a major source of income for many rural families in Bangladesh. Mostfamilies were already carrying debt loads beforethe cyclone. Following the cyclone, some micro-finance institutions took decisions to temporarilysuspend repayment of loans but communitiesexpressed fears that current grace periods of 3-6months were not long enough. These institutionsmust follow government advice and be moreflexible, as well as write-off loans in cycloneaffected areas as much as possible. There has alsobeen unscrupulous lending at very high interestrates for new loans. Special efforts will beneeded to ensure that sufficient amounts ofcredit are offered by micro-finance institutionsand banks at low or no interest rates to facilitaterecovery of those affected by the cyclone. Considering the country's high level of vulnerability to natural disasters, the govern-ment and international donors must commit tobetter rebuilding and so improve futureresilience to disasters. Scientists concur that theferocity and frequency of hazard events such ascyclones, hurricanes, and earthquakes haveincreased. Few countries are at higher risk ofclimate change than Bangladesh where expertsestimate that more than 50 million people couldbe made homeless by rising temperatures andsea levels. Climate migrants already account forat least one third of the impoverished peoplewho are flooding from rural areas to seek workin the city of Dhaka. Cyclone survivors have demonstrated a remarkable resilience in the face of disaster buttheir capacity to cope with the enormous chal-lenge of rebuilding their lives must not be over-estimated. The government of Bangladesh andthe international community have a legal andmoral responsibility for ensuring that theirneeds do not fall off a crowded humanitarianand development agenda.

The work presented here was commissioned by Action Contre la Faim-InternationalNetwork (ACF-IN) and took place betweenMay 2007 and June 2008. The research aimed to identify a novel method to assess the nutri- tion condition of pastoralist communities in coun-tries where ACF o perates: Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Chad, Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia,Uganda, and Kenya. Pastoralist populations arevulnerable to shocks that result in nutrition risks, e.g.drought, animal disease, market disruption andclosure of borders. However, the lack of a suitablesampling method for pastoralist surveys hascontributed to the omission of pastoralist popula-tions in emergency response and developmentprogrammes. The two main challenges in surveying pastoral- ist populations are: Case definition for wasting (the usual weight -for-height (WH) based case definition has returned higher prevalence's of malnutrition than Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)in pastoralist children over 24 months of age) 1. Selecting a representative sample in an area with a mobile, low density population for whom there are few reliable data on popu-lation size at the community level. Existing survey methods and their limitations in pastoralist settings Most surveys use a two-stage cluster sampling method, e.g. 30 by 30 cluster surveys andSMART surveys 2. Both methods use primary sampling units (PSUs) selected usingProbability Proportion to Size (PPS). Thisweights the sample according to communitysize, favouring large communities but does notensure a geographically representative sample.In pastoralist areas, community-level popula-tion data are not available and hence the PPSmethod does not work. Furthermore, mobilecommunities (troupes) change size and compo-sition throughout the year and may get smallerin crisis conditions as troupes disperse in searchof scant grazing resources. Any official informa-tion is likely, therefore, to be out-of-date at thetime of the survey. The Centric Systematic Area Sampling (CSAS)3approach has been used in estimating the coverage of feeding programmes4and for wide-area mapping of trachoma prevalence5.

The authors also acknowledge the surve y team and ACF administration in Kidal, Mali and the communities of Kidal for participating in the survey. The follow requirements were considered essential to define a new method:1. It should be a general method that can be adapted to the field situation using information gathered locally. 2. The sampling method should not require popula- tion data at the start and should not require knowledge of the location of populations ahead ofthe survey. 3. The method should be straightforward and effi- cient to conduct in the field. 4. It should be representative of the whole popula- tion - even remote communities. 5. An unbiased estimator should be used. 6. The precision should be predictable across differ- ent sample sizes and be similar to that obtained byconventional cluster sampled surveys in sedentary rural populations. 7. The case definition used should be appropriate for pastoralists and a good predictor of nutrition-associated mortality.Box 1: What are the requirements for a new method? 1Myatt, M, Duffield, A, Seal, A, and Pasteur, F.

The CSAS method has beenadapted for nutrition surveys in pastoralistareas, for example in Mali in the same location asthis field test 6,7. Although addressing some of the problems of PPS methods, the main problemwith CSAS is that it does not help the surveyteams locate the mobile population and hence alot of time is spent locating troupes.

Existing methods, advice from peer reviewers, nutrition assessment guidelines andthe experience of the consultants were used todesign the method. Computer-based simulationwas used to test the design statistically. Themethod was then field tested in Kidal, Mali withACH. Description of new method (Pastoralist Survey Method - PSM) An appropriate case-definition for malnutrition in pastoralists was developed based on MUAC forseveral reasons. Pastoralists tend to have differ-ent body shapes; compared to sedentary agrar-ian populations their sitting height to standingheight ratio is small. The body shape of pastoral-ists tends to produce inflated estimates of theprevalence of wasting using a WH based case-definition 8. MUAC gives more consistent esti- mates of malnutrition across different bodyshapes 9and is a better predictor of mortality than WH10, which is only weakly associated with nutrient reserves, nutrient requirements, andmortality. Compared to WH, MUAC measure-ment is quicker and more straightforward andrequires no heavy field equipment to carry. The sampling design makes use of local knowledge to construct the sampling frameusing qualitative methods. This information iscollected primarily from central locations inorder to:1.Define the organising factors (factors that define the way the population is socially and/or geographically organized) and the troupe (group of pastoralists who move through the territory (survey area) together. 2.Produce a detailed organisational tree (organogram ) of the troupes for each organ- ising factor. This organogram forms the basis of the sampling frame (Figure 1). 3.Estimate the average size of the troupe, i.e. the number of eligible children in the troupes. The statistical design of the method was tested by computer-based simulation using simulatedpopulations of pastoralists with data providedby peer reviewers. The simulation exerciseproduced nomograms that can be used to estimate the required sample size using the estimated sizeof troupe , precision required and estimated prevalence of malnutrition (see Figure 2). The method uses an exhaustive sample of children from each PSU ( troupe ). This way there is no need to 'spin a bottle' to select householdsto be sampled; all eligible children from selectedPSUs ( troupes ) are included in the sample. The use of MUAC facilitates the collection of anexhaustive sample. In the unlikely event that thetroupes are too large to include all eligible chil-dren in the sample, a second level of samplingmay be introduced. This eventuality has not sofar occurred and hence a method has not beendeveloped for it, although techniques such asmap-segment-sample that have been used toimprove the accuracy of cluster sampled surveyand in community level assessments oftrachoma prevalence are likely to prove suitable. Computer-based simulations found the method, when used with a bootstrap estimator,to be accurate (i.e. unbiased) and capable ofreturning estimates with useful precision (i.e.comparable to conventional designs) with read-ily achievable sample sizes. Particulars of the survey design The quantitative survey is designed using infor-mation gathered in the foregoing steps (i.e. theorganogram and the average troupe size). One or more troupes are combined (for the purposes of sampling) to form a PrimarySampling Unit (PSU). This is done if the averagetroupe size is less than about 10 children. Thenumber of PSUs to be sampled is then read fromthe nomogram and a systematic sample drawnfrom the sampling frame (constructed asdescribed above using the organogram). Onlywhen the PSUs (troupes) to be sampled havebeen chosen will it be necessary to locate them inthe field. Qualitative methods are used to findthe identified troupes. Information will comefrom the initial qualitative methods and by usingobservation and information from key inform-ants as you get closer to the selected PSUs(troupes). The nutrition assessment is carried out by measuring/assessing alleligible children in the sampled troupes. Data may be collated at thelevel of troupe or PSU and computerised usingspecially designed software. Test versions of thesoftware are available from: http://www.brixtonhealth.com/psm.html Data may be collected using simple tally sheets and the data-entry and data-managementcosts are considerably lower than required for acluster-sampled design using WH. How these design features meet the requirements The PSM is a general method that is adapted to the field situation when the organising factorand troupes can be defined. It is adaptable to different sized populations, sub-groupings andlocations. This is important as these may changeseasonally or in response to shocks such asdrought. The method was shown to be straight-forward and efficient to conduct in the field (seebelow). The results should be representative of the whole population, even remote communities, ifthe qualitative assessments are carried out thor-oughly and no sections of society are excluded.The PSM does not require population data at thestart and does not require knowledge of the loca-tion of populations ahead of the survey. Onlyonce troupes have been identified for samplingis it necessary to find them. At this stage youshould already have a good idea of their loca-tion. The sampling method has been tested statisti- cally using computer-based simulation and hasalso been field tested, as reported below.Computer-based simulations showed that theestimator was unbiased and precisionpredictable across a range of prevalences andsample sizes. The method may also be used tomeasure many other parameters, such as preva-lence of diarrhoea and vaccine coverage Use-study in Mali The survey took place in Kidal commune ofKidal district, eastern Mali in collaboration withACH. The population is approximately 30,000 ofwhom about 6,000 reside in Kidal town at anyone time. The area of the commune is approxi-mately 100,000 square kilometres. The popula-tion is largely nomadic pastoralist. The surveywas conducted during the cooler dry seasonbetween January-March 2008. This was not afood insecure season or a season with high riskof malnutrition.

Food and Nutrition Bulletin:SCN Nutrition Policy Paper 21, S7The example nomogram is for an estimated 10% prevalence of malnu- trition. To determine the required sample size (expressed as the requirednumber of PSUs), it is necessary to read the number of PSUs on the x-axis for different required precision on the y-axis. Here, the example isfor PSU size 15 and precision 3%. The PSU size of 15 lies half waybetween the lines for 10 and 20 on the graph. The arrow shows thesample size of 42 troupes is necessary with troupe size 15, prevalence10%, and precision 3%. A margin of error should be added to this; say15% giving sample size of 48 PSUs. Another way of doing this is to average the sample sizes read from the nomogram for PSU size 10 (48) and PSU size 20 (38) which is 43. At present, sample size 'calculations' are performed using a series of nomograms generated by computer-based sampling simulations.Further work will be directed towards producing a simple to use samplesize calculator.

This survey reported a prevalence of acute malnutritionof 5.0% (95% CI 3.8-6.2) of children WH z-score, with 1.9% inthe rural areas and 6.8% in the town. The rate of severe acute malnutrition was 0.3%(95% CI 0.1-0.7). Using MUAC, 0.8% were moderately wasted (defined as MUAC < 120mm & > 110 mm) and no children were severely wasted (defined as MUAC < 110mm) 12. No children in the rural areas were wasted. Application of the design to Kidal, Mali context Information was gathered and assembled with the help of key informants. The organising factor was identified as 'water point' because most troupes were located close to water points13. The water points were divided into small medium and large categories by key informants (with respect to the number of troupes using the waterpoint at that time). Troupe was identified as 'campement'; a group of pastoralists moving together. The average (mean) number of eligible children in each troupe was estimated to be seven,using information from key informants, local reports and observation. For the purposeof sampling, two neighbouring troupes were combined to form one PSU. Thecombined troupes would therefore include approximately 15 children. This was doneto make the field work easier - it is more straightforward to locate two neighbouringtroupes than two independently sampled troupes. The approach of combining troupesis valid statistically as long as the number of sampled PSUs is not less than about 25. An organogram was constructed with the relative size of each water point with respect to the number of troupes that were using the water point at the time of the survey. Theorganogram was used to produce a sampling frame of troupe-pairs by wa ter point and a systematic sample was taken to achieve the target sample size (Figure 3). The target sample size was read off the appropriate nomogram assuming 10% prevalence, PSU size of 15 and a required precision of 3% (Figure 2). This gives thetarget sample size of 42 troupe-pairs. A margin of error should be added to this of 10-15% to allow for overestimation of troupe size. In the Kidal survey our target samplesize was only 40 troupes (this was lower than recommended due to an error in readingthe nomogram and not adding the 10-15% for margin of error). On each day of the field assessment, information was collected from a group of pastoralists at each water point. A simple map was drawn of all the troupes using thewater point and their locations. The target number of troupe-pairs was selectedrandomly using this map to locate them (Figure 4). Each selected troupe was visitedand all eligible children measured. MUAC case definition was used along with oedemaassessment (Global Acute Malnutrition MUAC 125 mm or oedema and Severe AcuteMalnutrition MUAC <110 mm or oedema). This made the measurements on childrenvery rapid. The amount of time spent at each troupe was not greatly increased by thenumber of eligible children within each troupe. Most time was spent in travelling. Data were computerised using an excel spreadsheet and analysed using purpose- written software (Figure 5). No children were found with bipedal pitting oedema. The prevalence of global acute malnutrition by MUAC was 1.64% (95% CI 0.21-4.26%) and severe acute malnu-trition 0.43% (95% CI 0.01-1.12%). All cases of malnutrition were recorded in childrenheight 65-85cm (a proxy for age less than 24 months). Validation of the method Qualitative data were validated by comparing information collected through qualita-tive methods at the central location (Kidal town), from informants at the water pointsand observations from the field. This resulted in the following observations: Troupes were found within daily reach of water points and in locations predicted by key informants (within approximately 25 km of water points). Locations corresponded to the 'zones of occupation' available through local food security maps (Figure 6). Relative size of the water points (in terms of the number of troupes using each) corresponded well (Cohen's kappa test showed 'moderate inter-observer agreement'). For this test we compared information given by key informants in town and key informants at the water point. The mean number of eligible children found in each troupe was similar to the number predicted by key informants (7 predicted, 5.4 observed) Quantitative data were validated by comparing the precision of the estimates obtained in the field-trial to precision predicted by computer-based simulation. The prevalenceof wasting was low at the time of the survey, so to test the method, we varied case-defining MUAC cut-points to produce a series of testable prevalences. This resulted inthe following observations: Precision of the estimate of wasting from the field test was very similar to the precision predicted by computer-based simulations: 3.7% (actual) vs. 3.4% (predicted) testable prevalence of 9.9%wasting. Using different cut-points of MUAC to simulate different prevalences of wasting, the predicted and observed precision were strongly related over the entire range of prevalences between 5% and 50% (Figure 7).Figure 4: Example of a simple map drawn at each water point used to both enumerate and locate troupes (campements)Water Point Relative SizeAssignedPSUs CumulativePSUs PSUs chosenNo ofPSUs Inthagarene Small 5 0 Inkouf\u00e9 Small 5 10 6 1 Sendimane Medium 10 20 15 1 Ebelel Large 25 45 24, 33, 42 3 Taghararat Medium 10 55 51 1 Ighoras Medium 10 65 60 1 Intadeini Medium 10 75 69 1 Tanainait Medium 10 85 78 1 Igouzar Large 25 110 87, 96, 10 3 Tintersen Small 5 115 114 1 Tada\u00eft Small 5 120 0 Aghilhek Small 5 125 123 1 Djounhan Large 25 150 132, 141, 150 3 Djench\u00e9ch\u00e9 Large 25 175 159, 168 2 Tindamane Small 5 180 177 1 Takalot Large 25 205 186, 195, 204 3 Koniba Medium 10 215 213 1 Tafiliante Medium 10 225 222 1 Inf\u00e9l\u00e9f\u00e9l\u00e9 Small 5 230 0 Tassik Large 25 255 231, 240, 249 3 Aghabo Medium 10 265 258 1 Tinsinanane Medium 10 275 267 1 AgharousAlkit Large 25 300 276, 285, 294 3 Tahadjante Large 25 325 303, 312, 321 3 Kanaye Medium 10 335 330 1 Amassine Large 25 360 339, 348, 357 3 Intibzaz Large 25 385 366, 375, 384 3 TOTAL 385 43 Small water points were assigned 5 PSUs, medium water points were assigned 10 PSUs, large water points were assigned 25 PSUs based on information providedby key informants. A sampling interval of 9 was used with an initial starting value taken at randomfrom the range 1 to 9. In this example the 'organising factor' was water-point and the 'troupe' was campement. 27 water points were identified and 385 campement-pairs (PSUs)assigned to the water points. Water points described as 'small' were assigned 5pairs, 'medium' water points 10 and 'large' water points 25. These assignmentswere decided upon after qualitative data collection and were found to bereasonably accurate during the field trial. The target sample size was 40 PSUs, hence the sampling interval 385/40, rounded down to 9. Random number chosen was 6. The systematic samplingmethod increased the sample to 43, and all 43 PSUs were included in thesurvey. The sample size of 40 was actually chosen in error. It should have beencloser to 48 (see figure 2). The numbered diamonds represent the relative position of troupes. These data, collected from key informants at water-points were generally found to be accu-rate during the field trial.

PresidentClinton visited a number of national leadersfrom the developing world to ascertainviews on priority areas for intervention thatthe Foundation might support. A prevailingview was that poverty alleviation strategieswould be less effective for many countrieswithout simultaneously addressing thesupply and roll out of anti-retroviral (ARV)drugs for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. TheClinton Foundation therefore initiallyfocused on strengthening the market forARVs through working in parallel with bothdrug manufacturers and national treatmentprogrammes. The Foundation's recentinvolvement in the procurement of Ready toUse Therapeutic Foods (RUTF) has sinceraised its profile with agencies working inthe nutrition sector. The ENN thereforeinvited the Clinton Foundation to be thesubject of this issue's agency profile slot. Phone interviews were conducted with Rebecca Egan - clinical programme managerfor the 'Nutrition Access Team' and SeemaArora - the market development managerfor the team. Rebecca has spent a year and ahalf working with the Clinton Foundation'scountry teams on CMAM (communitymanagement of acute malnutrition) roll out,providing technical assistance and liaisingclosely with partners. Seema initially startedwork with the Foundation in the DrugAccess Team but has been working on theNutrition Access Team for approximatelyone year, focused on the supply-side. Thereare two other team members - Erika Wagner,the director based in London and SamMayer, a senior analyst based in New York.In addition, there are a number of ClintonFoundation staff working in the nutritionsector in countries where the Foundation isactive. For example, there is a group dedi-cated to nutrition and CMAM implementa-tion in Malawi. Although the Clinton Foundation initially began work in the HIV/AIDS sector, theFoundation swiftly grew to include otherglobal initiatives in areas like climate change,as well as more domestic focused work insmall business development, problems ofpoor nutrition and childhood obesity, andsustainable growth initiatives based domesti-cally and abroad. The objective of the ClintonDiscussion and Conclusions The method is practical for use in pastoral populations; it is valid and issimple to apply. The quantitative datacollection and data entry should presentno difficulties for staff that are already familiar with cluster surveys. Many staffwill be unfamiliar with collecting andanalysing qualitative data and willrequire some training in the methods.Experienced staff may be needed duringthe early stages to advise on the choice of'organising factor', for example. Thedelay between qualitative data andquantitative data collection needs to beas short as possible because seasonalchanges and other movements of peopleaffect the validity of the qualitative data. The method could be used for any zone where population data are not wellknown in advance/ a population ismoving, e.g. to escape conflict (althoughit may prove difficult to identify usefulkey informants to describe and locate'communities' in such settings). The method of sampling can be used for collecting information on manydifferent variables in addition to malnu-trition. Good relations, both within the popu- lation and between the population andthe agency carrying out the survey, arerequired because reliable informationmust be gathered from the people in thearea to be surveyed. In situations ofconflict or other social divisions, it maybe difficult or impossible to get unbiasedinformation. As a general principle, thereshould be no survey without the provi-sion of services to the community. The urban and rural areas both need to be included to allow for migrationsbetween the two zones. Each requiresdifferent methods of sampling. Duringthe harsh season, the children oftenmove to urban areas where prevalence ofmalnutrition may be much higher thanin the rural areas. This was shown in theprevious survey in Kidal 14. Further testing is necessary, especially in different pastoralist settings, and read-ers are invited to communicate with ACFabout further trials. A field manual isbeing developed to assist the futuredevelopment of the method.

The figure shows the data input screen (left) and the results screen (right) with an explanatory pop-up (centre). The shaded area shows Kidal Commune, the administrative zone for the study.Most campements were staying within the 'zones of occupation' at the time of thesurvey. The zones of occupation were identified by satellite imaging by theBamako-based ACH team. Some waterpoints and campements were sampledoutside this administrative area; this is inevitable in this terrain where borders arenot apparent on the ground. The different prevalences from 5 to 50% represent different case-defining MUAC cut-off points to give the chosen prevalence. The graph shows that between 5 and40% prevalence of wasting, the observed precision from the field test was veryclose to the precision predicted by computer-based simulation. At prevalenceshigher than 40%, the observed precision deviates slightly from the precision thatwas predicted using computer-based simulations.Field Article Figure 6: Waterpoints and selected survey in Kidal Commune, Kidal Cercle camp waterfrontzone of occupation Kidal 3 4 5 6 73 4 5 6 7Predicted Precsion (%) Observed Precsion (%) Pastoralist key informant at water point in Kidal.Anne Marie Mayer, Mali, 2008 Seema Arora, Ethiopia, 200834Name: Clinton Foundation Address: 55 West CEO No. of HQ staff No of staff world- wide (40 countries):4 1,100 staff and volunteersAgency Profile Foundation HIV/AIDS Initiative (CHAI) is to increase access for HIV/AIDS care and treat-ment in the developing world through loweringprices for drugs, diagnostics and othercommodities. When CHAI began in 2003, theARV market was fragmented and suppliers wereunable to take advantage of economies of scaleand therefore, unable to lower the price of drugs.To address this, CHAI has worked to increasecoordination between the demand and supplysides of the AIDS treatment market in order tocatalyze significant price reductions for ARVs. Because ARV access for children has histori- cally lagged far behind that of adults, CHAIbegan to focus on paediatric HIV treatmentwith the launch of its Paediatric Initiative in2005. This was effectively the entry point forCHAI's work in nutrition, as the relationshipbetween HIV and severe acute malnutrition(SAM) is so pronounced in many developingcountries. The Foundation quickly came torealise that there are many strong linkagesbetween SAM and HIV , and that in addressingSAM the quality of care for HIV treatmentcould be significantly improved. CHAI wassubsequently chosen by UNITAID (a donororganisation supported by many nationalgovernments and seated within the WorldHealth Organisation (WHO)) to be an imple-menting partner for a large scale donation ofpaediatric commodities. At CHAI's request,RUTF was included in this donation with 25countries eligible to receive it. Since the incep-tion of the UNITAID programme, CHAI hasbecome the third largest purchaser of RUTFglobally (behind UNICEF and Medecins sansFrontieres). CHAI has established memoranda of under- standing (MOUs) with a number of govern-ments to provide RUTF. Programme implemen-tation support is offered via national govern-ments in select countries where local partnersare strong. CHAI-procured RUTF is used totreat SAM-affected children whether HIV posi-tive or not. In countries where CHAI is offeringprogrammatic support in addition to the dona-tion of the product, this can include assistancewith development of treatment protocols, offer-ing forecasting and supply chain managementsupport, supporting trainings and secondingstaff, or clinical mentors for paediatric andCMAM facilities. The significant growth seen in the past year in RUTF production capacity has reduced thesupply-side bottlenecks associated with thescale up of CMAM programmes. In CHAI'sexperience, the stumbling block is now on the programmatic side, with a lack of capacity toimplement CMAM. CHAI has been workingclosely with UNICEF and governments to iden-tify implementing partners for CMAM and hasbeen strongly advocating to get more fundingfor CMAM implementation and roll out. Another focus of CHAI's work in RUTF has been in looking at whether price reductions forRUTF are possible. CHAI has conducted signif-icant analyses of supplier cost structures todetermine if there are areas where costs can becut. These analyses have revealed that ingeneral, RUTF suppliers are operating withslim margins and there is minimal potential forprice reduction if the RUTF formulationremains unchanged. To address this, CHAI isworking to generate funds for research intoalternative formulations involving industrypartners. Other supply side initiatives arecentred on addressing concerns of new regionaland local suppliers. CHAI have worked to forma consortium for purchasing milk powder,thereby cutting out intermediaries and extracosts, and has also mapped out solutions toother commonly faced barriers to market entry.CHAI is optimistic that as new products andnew suppliers enter the market, prices willcome down to a level that governments caneventually afford so that programmes becomedomestically sustainable. CHAI have endeavoured to strengthen government capacity to actually implementCMAM although with a growing evidence baseof success in some countries, the political buy inis likely to increase demand and create sustain-able resources and capacity for implementation.CHAI believe that decentralisation of CMAM tocommunity level may be more challenging atthis stage, but that with greater funding for HIVprogramming and home based careprogrammes, there is the potential for CMAM topiggy-back onto these existing programmes.This is already occurring in countries likeCameroon and Nigeria. Greater integration withIntegrated Management of Childhood Illness(IMCI) will also help with decentralisation. The Clinton Foundation obtains funds from a number of foundations, private donors, andgovernments. President Clinton is still veryinvolved in fund-raising and is an excellentspokesperson for the Foundation. As UNITADfunding for RUTF winds down over the comingyears, CHAI has been working with agencieslike PEPFAR, the Global Fund and others toensure a smooth transition of CHAI RUTFprocurements beyond the UNITAID programme. The Global Fund has begun toconsider RUTF procurement in their grants, sofunding for the commodity could becomesecure in the short-term. The Foundation isvery aware of issues around RUTF supplysustainability and transition funding. For exam-ple, in Malawi where government is signifi-cantly decentralised and CMAM is being rolledout nationally, an agreement has been reachedfor each district to provide a certain percentageof resources for RUTF procurement. Thispercentage should increase each year by thatpercentage annually until most, if not all costs,are ultimately paid for by the districts. Both Seema and Rebecca see CHAI as unique in that it works on both the demand andsupply sides of commodity marketplaces.Although CHAI began its work in RUTF as aprocurement body with little intention of being'hands-on', it has had to roll up its sleeves andget involved in overseeing programme imple-mentation in certain countries. This has necessi-tated forging strong relationships with govern-ment and often providing consultants andspecialists seconded to government. CHAI hasalso supported government proposal writing tothe Global Fund so that some programmes arenow successfully funded. When asked about major gaps and chal- lenges in the nutrition sector from a ClintonFoundation perspective, Seema and Rebeccacited a number of areas. The lack of compre-hensive care for SAM children leading to frac-tured programme implementation is a bigworry. This is caused by lack of funding for keyimplementation components, with the problemmost pronounced in development rather thanemergency settings. They also expressedconcern about high default rates in outpatienttherapeutic programme and supplementaryfeeding centre facilities, especially in urbanareas, as well as weak monitoring and evalua-tion of these phenomena. In connection withthis they wondered about the appropriatenessof SPHERE standards in some contexts andwhether there may be a need to re-think these. The Clinton Foundation has now grown into a global non-governmental organisation with1,100 staff and volunteers in more than 40 coun-tries. Its rapid expansion and diverse fundingsources suggests that the Foundation willcontinue to grow in scope and engagement. Itwill be fascinating to see how the Foundationchooses to engage with the humanitariancommunity, as well as how big a player itbecomes.

COOPI is an Italian non-governmentalorganisation (NGO) that has worked inthe Democratic Republic of the Congo(DRC) since 1970. Its main sectors of intervention nowadays are health, nutrition,psychosocial care and water/sanitation. As aleading NGO in the nutrition sector in easternDRC, COOPI was asked by the Ministry ofHealth and UNICEF to run a pilot phase of aCommunity-based Therapeutic Care (CTC)programme in Bunia (Ituri) and to provide tech-nical assistance in the preparation of the nationalCTC protocol. In late 2007, ECHO (European Commission Humanitarian Office) funded COOPI to providenutritional care (or support) to Binza's popula-tion (over 100,000 people) in North Kivuprovince. The target population included manyreturnees who were subject to a high degree ofinsecurity, due to national army and rebelgroups' dispute and conflict over the area.Displacements were frequent due to continuousattacks and pillaging by the warring factions. Theintervention goals were to: Provide technical, logistic and financial assistance to a local NGO (BDOM 1) who was already running two therapeutic feedingcentres (TFC) and ten SFC Supplementary Feeding Centres Set up a CTC programme to replace the classical centre-based approach, This would involve training of BDOM and provincial health personnel, rehabilitation of SFC tents, and establish Stabilisation Centres (SC) in two hospitals, transport of food and no n-food items and supervisio n of act ivities until the programme was fully integrated into existingservices. By January 2009, the traditional inpatient thera- peutic programmes have progressively beenreplaced by CTC programmes throughout thecountry. In 2008, the national CTC protocol hadbeen validated by health authorities, interna-tional organisations and NGOs, and was await-ing final approval and publication. The COOPICTC programme in Binza started in January 2008and included two SC and ten SFC/OTP(Outpatient Therapeutic Programmes). All thehealth centres in the zone hosted a SFC/OTPproviding good geographical coverage of thezone. After seven months, 652 severely malnour-ished children had been admitted (averaging 93per month); the cure rate was above 90% andmortality less than 2%. An anthropometric andcoverage survey was undertaken at this point tomonitor the progress of malnutrition rates andprogramme coverage. The anthropometricsurvey showed a significant fall in most indica-tors of malnutrition (see Table 1) compared to theprevious survey conducted in November 2007.However, it was not possible to infer that thiswas due to the COOPI intervention or the newCTC approach: seasonality effect, improvementin security, food aid and better crops were likelyto have been at least partly responsible for thispositive trend. There were no baseline data available on coverage of the therapeutic feeding programmeso that the CTC programme coverage surveywas, to the best of our knowledge, the firstassessment of this type in the whole province.Coverage survey methodology and constraints The coverage survey was undertaken in July 2008. The CSAS methodology (centric system-atic area sampling), which is based on activecase-finding, was used 2. The first step in the implementation of this methodology consistedof drawing or overlaying a grid on a map of thearea under investigation. The communitiesclosest to the centre of each square were thenthe first to be surveyed. Constraint 1: Lack of a detailed map of villagesNo detailed map of the health zone was avail-able for Binza and recent population move-ment had resulted in many villages being aban-doned. When this problem occurred in previ-ous surveys, a 'blank' map had been given toall the field teams so that on the day of datacollection, they could locate the village closestto the centre of the square by means of a land-mark shown on the map, e.g. river, hills,villages, etc. This method proved to be verytime consuming, inaccurate and ultimately,prone to bias; the teams would hurry throughthis first phase in order to maximise time forthe data collection itself. Moreover, wheremaps didn't show any physical landmarks orno landmarks were present, the task provedeven more difficult. Constraint 2: Absentees at the time of measurementIn previous coverage surveys, another problemwas that many children were absent when theteam visited the household. Children under 5years of age are usually taken to the field withtheir mothers early in the morning and comeback at sunset. Where this occurred, anappointment, whenever possible, would bemade and a second visit arranged to measurethe absent children at a later stage. Moreover, the active case-finding approach needs the assistance of carers, key informantsand local authorities to identify suspectedmalnourished children and those childrenenrolled in a programme. However, whenthose people were contacted on the day of datacollection, many complained about not havinghad sufficient notice to think about the childrento include in the survey (and to inform them).This process further reduced the time thatCOOPI field teams had for data collection. A new strategy A two-phase modified methodology was there-fore designed to address these problems. In thefirst phase, Global Positioning System (GPS)receivers were used to select the target villagesand key informants were informed about thesurvey and asked to assist in case finding. Inthe second phase, the teams focused solely onanthropometric data collection.

An updated list ofvillages and populations of the interventionarea was obtained at the Central Health Officeof the Binza's Health Zone ( Bureau Central de la Zone de Sant\u00e9 ). The provincial doctor, nurses and community health workers were asked toposition all the villages from the list onto themap. A provisional, partially hand-drawn, mapwas then available for the survey. A grid was drawn on the map, and 23 out of 30 squares were selected on the basis of havingat least 50% of their area in the health zone. Thecentre of each of these squares was found (trac-ing diagonals) and its latitude and longitudecalculated from the data on the sidebars. Thiswas subsequently recorded on four GPSreceivers (again kindly provided by OCHA). woods or being far from any road). In these cases, with the aid of local people, the team hadto estimate the location and find the nearestvillage. Once the village or community closest to the centre was identified, local authorities, healthcommunity workers and other key informantswere met and informed about the objectives,sample and timetable of the survey. They werealso asked to think about children to include, toestablish a list with their names and to askthem to stay at home on the day of the datacollection. These actions were repeated in thenext nearest villages until five villages werevisited within one square. Given the averagesize of the villages, the anticipated number ofchildren to assess and the time available, weestimated that no more than five villages couldbe visited in one day. The time lag between thefirst visit to a village and the data collectionwas seven days, on average. Each team wasable to work on two squares per day therebyvisiting a maximum of ten villages. The first-phase teams recorded the names of each village, their relative position within onesquare (1 being the nearest to the centre and 5the last visited village) and the name of themost significant authority met. Coordinates ofall visited villages were also recorded on GPS. It had been hoped that a more accurate mapwould be produced once the GPS coordinatesof the villages had been handed over to OCHAand that a re-allocation of villages into the 23squares based on the updated map would havebeen possible. However, due to technical prob-lems with the large format printer, this was notpossible and the provisional map was useduntil the end of the survey. Phase 2: Data collection In the second part of the fieldwork, the fullsurvey team (20 people divided into fivegroups) visited the survey area. No GPS ormaps were needed during this stage. Eachteam was handed the list of villages to visit ineach square (until 3 p.m. or until the comple-tion of the five villages) and the person tocontact. The list of suspected malnourished orin-programme children was also given to themso that they could focus exclusively on datacollection. As expected, the vast majority of thechildren's caretakers were aware of the surveyand present. Results The coverage rates were worked out for boththe OTPs and the SFPs. The results are set outin Table 2. Given the relatively short duration of the CTC programme, and the upward trend inadmissions at the OTP and SFP , we considerthese results to be acceptable, althoughAny GPS receiver, including non-carto- graphic ones, can perform the tasks demandedfor this survey. However, it is important toconfigure the devices so that they all have thesame coordinate system as the map.Furthermore the longitude and latitude datafrom the map had to be converted fromdegrees/minutes/seconds into decimaldegrees, as used by the GPS 3. At this point a first field visit with the follow- ing objectives was planned: Locating the waypoints recorded on the GPS (square's centre) and the closest village to that point. Inform the authorities and health workers of the villages about the survey. Four teams (of two people each) were trained on GPS usage, people to contact and messagesto convey. They were also given a list ofvillages within each square. The GPS receivers were set on the 'go to' mode, which shows the direction and thedistance to a given waypoint. These activities largely ran smoothly. However there were some reported problemswith estimating the GPS waypoint locationwhen these were not reachable (due to thick improvement is possible. The rise in programme admission in spite of a lowerprevalence of moderate and severe malnutri-tion (a 53% reduction since the last nutritionsurvey) is probably partly due to better cover-age. Further investigation into programmecoverage and anthropometric status of thepopulation in 4-6 months time has been recom-mended, to achieve better understanding ofprogramme performance and its evolution. Conclusions The two-phase coverage survey methodology,based on the CSAS procedure, was developedto get around the problem of lack of a detailedmap of the area under investigation, as well asother constraints, e.g. lack of notice to keyinformants and population. This method facili-tates identification of the villages to survey bymeans of GPS devices. Other advantagesinclude less bias in village selection, a lowerabsentee rate, a reduced number of missed chil-dren (suspected malnourished children or in-programme who are not referred to the surveyteam), more time (and energy) available for theteams for the data collection. However, thismethodology does require some additionalresources, i.e. the first-phase necessitated eightpeople working for four days. A normal cover-age survey on average involves 20 peopleworking for 7-10 days for the entire data collec-tion process. Other extra costs for the newmethod were only incurred for vehiclesrunning costs, as GPS devices were borrowedfrom OCHA. Although not achieved in this case due to technical problems, the use of GPS to recordvillage coordinates at the time of the visitshould allow the production of more detailedmaps for future use and a more accurate calcu-lation of coverage in each square.
