Here are some basics. First things first - some notes on how we use words. Then we explain how your plan works so you can get the most out of your coverage. But for all the details - this is very important - you need to read this entire booklet -certificate and the schedule of benefits. And if you need h elp or more information, we tell you how to reach us. Some notes on how we use words When we say \"you\" and \"your\", we mean both you and any covered dependents, if dependent coverage is available under your plan. When we say \"us\", \"we\", and \"our\", we mean Aetna . Some words appear in bold type. We define them in the Glossary section. Sometimes we use technical medical language that is familiar to medical providers . What your plan does - providing covered benefits Your plan provides covered benefits . These are eligible health services . Your plan has an obligation to pay for eligible health services . How your plan works - starting and stopping coverage Your coverage under the plan has a start and an end. You start coverage after you complete the elig ibility and enrollment process. To learn more see the Who the plan covers section. Your coverage typically ends when you leave your job. Family members can lose coverage for many reasons, such as growing up and leaving home. To learn more see the When cov erage ends section. Ending coverage under the plan doesn't necessarily mean you lose coverage with us. See the Special coverage options after your plan coverage ends section. How your plan works while you are covered in -network Your in -network coverage helps you : Get and pay for a lot of - but not all - health care services. These are eligible health services . Pay less cost share when you use a network provider . 1. Eligible health services Doctor and hospital services are the base for many other services. You'll probably find the preventive care and wellness, emergency services and urgent condition coverage especially important. But the plan won't always cover the services you want. Sometimes it doesn't cover health care services your doctor will want you to have. So what are eligible health services ? They are health care services that meet these three requirements: They appear in the Eligible health services under your plan section. They are not listed in the What your plan doesn't cover -eligible health service exceptions and exclusions section. (We will refer to this section as the \" exceptions \" section in the rest of this booklet -certificate.) They are not beyond any limits in the schedule of benefits. 2. Providers Our network of doctors, hospitals and other health care providers are there to give you the care you need. You can find network providers and see important information about them most easily on our online provider directory . Just log into your Aetna Navigator\u00ae secure member website at www.aetna.com. AL SG HCOC -2017 -PPO 01 OFF -HIX 5 NV 2017 You may choose a primary care physician (we call that doctor your PCP) to oversee your care. Your PCP will provide your routine care, and send you to other providers when you need specialized care. You don't have to access care through your PCP. You may go directly to network specialists and providers for eligible health services . Your plan often will pay a bigger share for eligible health services that you get through your PCP, so choose a PCP as soon as you can. For more information about the provider directory and the role of your PCP, see the Who provides the care section. 3. Paying for eligible health services - the general requirements There are several general requirements for the plan to pay any part of the expense for an eligible health service . They are: The eligible health service is medically necessary You get the eligible health service from a network or out-of-network provider You or your provider precertifies the eligible health service when required You will find details on medical necessity and precertification requirements in the Medical necessity and precertification requirements section. You will find the requirement to use a network provider and any exceptions in the Who provides the care section. 4. Paying for eligible health services - sharing the expense Generally your plan and you will share the expense of your eligible health services when you meet the general requirements for paying. But sometimes your plan will pay the entire expense; and sometimes you will. For more information see the What the plan pays and what you pay section, and see the schedule of benefits. 5. Disagreements We know that people sometim es see things differently. The plan tells you how we will work through our differences. And if we still disagree, an independent group of experts called an \"external review organization\" or ERO for short will sometimes make the final decision for us. For more information see the When you disagree - claim decisions and appeals procedures section. How your plan works while you are covered out -of-network You have coverage when you want to get your care from providers who are not part of the Aetna network , network providers without a primary care physician (PCP) referral and from non-designated network providers under your plan. It's called out -of-network coverage. Your out -of-network coverage: Means you may have to pay for services at the time they are p rovided. You may be required to pay the full charges and submit a claim for reimbursement to us. You are responsible for completing and submitting claim forms for reimbursement of eligible health services that you paid directly to a provider . Means that wh en you use out -of-network coverage, it is your responsibility to start the precertification process with providers . Means you will pay a higher cost share when you use an out-of-network provider . AL SG HCOC -2017 -PPO 01 OFF 6 NV 2017 You will find details on: Precertification requirements in the Medical necessity and precertification requirements section.

AL SG HCOC -2017 -PPO 01 OFF -HIX 10 NV 2017 Medical necessity and precertification requirements The starting point for covered benefits under your plan is whether the services and supplies are eligible health services. See the Eligible health services under your plan and Exceptions sections plus the schedule of benefits. Your plan pays for its share of the expense for eligible health services only if the general requirements are met. They are: The eligible health service is medically necessary . You or your provider precer tifies the eligible health service when required. This section addresses the medical necessity and precertification requirements. You will find the requirement to use a network provider and any exceptions in the Who provides the care section. Medically necessary; medical necessity As we said in the Let's get started! section, medical necessity is a requirement for you to receive eligible health services under this plan. The medical necessity requirements are in the Glossary section, where we define \"medically necessary, medical necessity \". That's where we also explain what our medical directors or a physician they assign consider when determining if an eligible health service is medically necessary . Precertification You need pre -approval from us for some eligible health services . Pre -approval is also called precertification . In-network : Your physician or PCP is responsible for obtaining any necessary precertification before you get the care. If your physician or PCP doesn't get a required precertification , we won't pay the provider who gives you the care. You won't have to pay either if your physician or PCP fails to ask us for precertification . If your physician requests precertification and we refuse it, you can s till get the care but the plan won't pay for it. You will find details on requirements in the What the plan pays and what you pay - Important exceptions - when you pay all section. Out-of-network: When you go to an out-of-network provider , you are responsible to obtain precertification from us for any services and supplies on the precertification list. If you do not precertify , your benefits may be reduced, or the plan may not pay. See your schedule of benefits for this information. The li st of services and supplies that require precertification appears later in this section.

If precertification determines that the stay or services and supplies are not covered benefits , we will explain why and how our decision can be appealed. You or your provider may request a review of the precertification decision. See the When you disagree - claim decisions and appeals procedures section. What if you don't obtain the required precertification? If you don't obtain the required precertification : Your benefits may be reduced, or the plan may not pay any benefits.

AL SG HCOC -2017 -PPO 01 OFF -HIX 55 NV 2017 Who provides the care Just as the starting point for coverage under your plan is whether the services and supplies are eligible health services , the foundation for getting covered care is the network. This section tells you about network and out-of- network providers . Network providers We have contracted with providers to provide eligible health services to you. These providers make up the network for your plan. For you to receive the network level of benefits you must use network providers for eligible health services . There a re some exceptions: Emergency services - refer to the description of emergency services and urgent care in the Eligible health services under your plan section. Urgent care - refer to the description of emergency services and urgent cares in the Eligible health services under your plan section. You may select a network provider from the directory or by logging on to our website at www.aetna.com. You can search our online directory , DocFind\u00ae, for names and locations of providers . You will not have to submit claims for treatment received from network providers . Your network provider will take care of that for you. And we will directly pay the network provider for what the plan owes. Your PCP We encourage you to access eligible health services through a PCP. They will provide you with primary care. A PCP can be any of the following providers available under your plan: General practitioner Family physician Internist Pediatrician OB, GYN, and OB/GYN How do you choose your PCP? You can choose a PCP from the list of PCPs in our directory . Each covered family member is encouraged to select a PCP. You may each select a different PCP.

Your PCP will coordinate your medical care or may provide treatment. They may send you to other network providers . Your PCP can also: Order lab tests and radiological services Prescribe medicine or therapy Arrange a hospital stay or a stay in another facility How do I change my PCP? You may change your PCP at any time. You can call us at the toll -free number on your ID card or log on to your Aetna Navigator\u00ae secure member website at www.aetna.com to make a change. AL SG HCOC -2017 -PPO 01 OFF -HIX 56 NV 2017 Out-of-network providers You also have access to out-of-network providers. This means you can receive eligible health services from an out-of-network provider . If you use an out-of-network provider to receive eligible h ealth services , you are subject to a higher out -of-pocket expense and are responsible for: Paying your out -of-network deductible Your out -of-network coinsurance Any charges over our recognized charge Submitting your own claims and getting precertification when required Keeping a provider you go to now (c ontinuity of care) You may have to find a new provider when: You join the plan and the provider you have now is not in the network You are already a member of Aetna and your provider stops being in our network However, in some cases, you may be able to keep going to your current provider to complete a treatment or to have treatment that was already scheduled. This is called continuity of care. If you are a new enrollee and your provider is a non -designated network provider When your non -designated network provider stops participation with us Request for approval You need to complete a Transition of Coverage Request form and send it to us. Call Member Services at the numb er on the back of your ID card to get the form. You or your provider should call us for approval to continue any care.

We will authorize coverage for the transitional period only if the provider agrees to our usual terms and conditions for contracting providers . AL SG HCOC -2017 -PPO 01 OFF -HIX 57 NV 2017 What the plan pays and what you pay Who pays for your eligible health services - this plan, both of us, or just you? That depends. This section gives the general rule and explains these key terms: Your deductible Your copayments/coinsurance Your maximum out -of-pocket limit We also remind you that sometimes you will be responsible for paying the entire bill - for example, if you get care that is not an eligible health servi ce. The general rule When you get eligible health services : You pay for the entire expense up to any deductible limit. And then The plan and you share the expense up to any maximum out -of-pocket limit . The schedule of benefits lists how much your plan pays and how much you pay for each type of health care service. Your share is called a copayment/coinsurance . And then The plan pays the entire expense after you reach your maximum out -of-pocket limit . When we say \"expense\" in this general rule, we mean negotiated charge for a network provider , and recognized charge for an out-of-network provider . See the Glossary section for what these terms mean. Important note - when your plan pays all Your plan pay s the entire expense for all in -network eligible health services under the preventive care and wellness benefit. Important note - when you pay all You pay the entire expense for an eligible health service : When you get a health care service or supply that is not medically necessary . See the Medical necessity and precertification requirements section. When your plan requires precertification , it was requested, we refused it, and you get an eligible health service without precertification . See the Medical nec essity and precertification requirements section. In all these cases, the provider may require you to pay the entire charge. And any amount you pay will not count towards your deductible or towards your maximum out -of-pocket limit . AL SG HCOC -2017 -PPO 01 OFF -HIX 58 NV 2017 Special financial responsibility You are responsible for the entire expense of: Cancelled or missed appointments Neither you nor we are responsible for: Charges for which you have no legal obligation to pay Charges that would not be made if you did not have coverage Charg es, expenses or costs in excess of the negotiated charge for in -network covered benefits . Where your schedule of benefits fits in How your medical plan deductible works The deductible is the amount you need to pay for eligible health services before you r plan begins to pay for eligible health services . Your schedule of benefits shows the deductible amounts for your plan. Your schedule of benefits shows the deductible amounts that apply to your plan. Once you have met your deductible , we will start sharing the cost when you get eligible health services . You will continue to pay copayments/coinsurance for covered benefits after you meet any applicable deductible . How your copayment /coinsurance works Your copayment /coinsurance is the a mount you pay for eligible health services after you have paid your deductible . Your schedule of benefits shows you what copayments /coinsurance you will pay for specific eligible health services . We can change your copayments if we give the policyholder 30 days written notice. You will pay the PCP copayment /coinsurance when you receive eligible health services from any PCP. You will pay less cost sharing when you use a designated network provider for eligible health services . Your cost sharing will be generally higher when non-designated network providers are used. How your maximum out -of-pocket limit works You will pay your deductible and copayments /coinsurance up to the maximum out -of-pocket limit for your plan. Your schedule of benefits shows the maximum out -of-pocket limits that apply to your plan. Once you reach your maximum out -of-pocket limit , your plan will pay for covered benefits for the remainder of that calendar year . Important note: See the schedule of benefits for any deductibles, copayments /coinsurance , maximum out -of-pocket limit and maximum age, visits, days, hours, admissions and other limitations that may apply. AL SG HCOC -2017 -PPO 01 OFF -HIX 59 NV 2017 When you disagree - claim decisions and appeal procedures In the previous section, we explained how you and we share responsibility for paying for your eligible health services . When a claim comes in, we review it, make a decision and tell you how you and we will split the expense. We also explain what you can do if you think we got it wrong. Claim procedures For claims involving out-of-network providers : Notice Requirement Deadline Submit a claim You should notify and request a claim form from us. The claim form will provide instructions on how to complete and where to send the form(s). You must send us notice and proof as soon as reasonably possible. If you are unable to complete a claim form, you may send us: A description of services Bill of charges Any medical documentation you received from your provi der Proof of loss (claim) When you have received a service from an eligible provider, you will be charged. The information you receive for that service is your proof of loss. A completed claim form and any additional information required by us. You must send us notice and proof as soon as reasonably possible. Benefit payment Written proof must be provided for all benefits. If any portion of a claim is contested by us, the uncontested portion of the claim will be paid promptly after the receipt of proof of loss. Benefits will be paid as soon as the necessary proof to support the claim is received. AL SG HCOC -2017 -PPO 01 OFF -HIX 60 NV 2017 Types of claims and communicating our claim decisions You or your provider are required to send us a claim in writing. You can request a claim form from us. We will review that claim for payment to the provider or to you as appropriate. There are different types of claims. The amount of time that we have to tell you about our d ecision on a claim depends on the type of claim. The section below will tell you about the different types of claims. Urgent care claim An urgent claim is one for which delay in getting medical care could put your life or health at risk. Or a delay might put your ability to regain maximum function at risk. Or it could be a situation in which you need care to avoid severe pain. If you are pregnant, an urgent claim also includes a situation that can cause serious risk to the health of your unborn baby. Pre-service claim A pre -service claim is a claim that involves services you have not yet received and which we will pay for only if we precertify them. Post -service claim A post service claim is a claim that involves health care services you have already received. Concurrent care claim extension A concurrent care claim extension happens when you ask us to approve more services than we already have approved. Examples are e xtending a hospital stay or adding a number of visits to a provider . Concurrent care claim reduction or termination A concurrent care claim reduction or termination happens when we decide to reduce or stop payment for an already approved course of treatm ent. We will tell you when we make that decision. You will have enough time to file an appeal. Your coverage for the service or supply will continue until you receive a final appeal decision from us or an external review organization if the situation is el igible for external review. During this continuation period, you are still responsible for your share of the costs, such as copayments /coinsurance and deductibles that apply to the service or supply. If we support our decision at the final internal appeal , you will be responsible for all of the expenses for the service or supply received during the continuation period. The chart below shows the different types of claims and how much time we have to tell you about our decision. We may need to tell your physician about our decision on some types of claims, such as a concurrent care claim, or a claim when you are already receiving the health care services or are in the hospital . AL SG HCOC -2017 -PPO 01 OFF -HIX 61 NV 2017 Type of notice Urgent care claim Pre-service claim Post -service claim Concurrent care claim Initial decision by us 72 hours 15 days 30 days 24 hours for urgent request*, or 72 hours if clinical information is required and received more than 24 hours after request * Extensions Not applicable 15 days 15 days If we request more information Not applicable 15 days 15 days Time you have to send us additional information 48 hours 45 days 45 days *We have to receive the request at least 24 hours before the previously approved health care services end. Adverse benefit determinations We pay many claims at the full rate negotiated charge with a network provider and the recognized charge with an out-of-network provider , except for your share of the costs. But sometimes we pay only some of the claim. And sometimes we don't pay at all. Any time we don't pay even part of the claim that is an \"adverse benefit determination\" or \"adverse decision\". It is also an \"adverse benefit determination\" if we rescind your coverage entirely. Rescission means you lose coverage going forwa rd and going backward. If we paid claims for your past coverage, we will want the money back. If we make an adverse benefit determination, we will tell you in writing. The difference between a complaint and an appeal A complaint You may not be happy abou t a provider or an operational issue, and you may want to complain. You can call or write Member Services. Your complaint should include a description of the issue. You should include copies of any records or documents that you think are important. We will review the information and provide you with a written response within 30 calendar days of receiving the complaint . We will let you know if we need more information to make a decision. An appeal You can ask us to re -review an adverse benefit determination . This is called an appeal. You can appeal to us verbally or in writing. Appeals of adverse benefit determinations You can appeal our adverse benefit determination. We will assign your appeal to someone who was not involved in making the original decision. You must file an appeal within 180 calendar days from the time you receive the notice of an adverse benefit determ ination. You can appeal by sending a written appeal to the address on the notice of adverse benefit determination. Or you can call Member Services at the number on your ID card.

You can use an authorized representative at any level of appeal. You can appeal two times under this plan. If you appeal a second time you must present your appeal within 60 calendar days from the date you receive the notice of the first appeal decision. Urgent care or pre -service claim appeals If your claim is an urgent claim or a pre -service claim, your provider may appeal for you without having to fill out a form. We will provide you with any new o r additional information that we used or that was developed by us to review your claim.

AL SG HCOC -2017 -PPO 01 OFF -HIX 65 NV 2017 Coordination of benefits Some people have health coverage under more than one health plan. If you do, we will work together with your other plan(s) to decide how much each plan pays. This is called coordination of benefits (COB). Key terms Here are some key terms we use in this section. These terms will help you understand this section. Allowable expense means: A health care expense that any of your health plans cover to any degree. If the health care service is not covered by any of the plans, it is not an allowable expense. For example, cosmetic surgery generally is not an allowable expense under this plan. In this section when we talk about a \"plan\" through which you may have other coverage for health care expenses, we mean: Group or non -group, blanket, or franchise health insurance policies issued by insurers, HMOs, or health care service contractors Labor -management trustee plans, labor organization plans, employer organization plans, or employee benefit organization plans An automobile insuran ce policy Medicare or other governmental benefits Any contract that you can obtain or maintain only because of membership in or connection with a particular organization or group Here's how COB works The primary plan pays first. When this is the prima ry plan, we will pay your claims first as if the other plan does not exist. The secondary plan pays after the primary plan. When this is the secondary plan, we will pay benefits after the primary plan and will reduce the payment based on any amount the pri mary plan paid. We will never pay an amount that, when combined with payments from your other coverage, add up to more than 100% of the allowable expenses. Determining who pays Reading from top to bottom the first rule that applies will determine which p lan is primary and which is secondary. A plan that does not contain a COB provision is always the primary plan. If you are: Primary plan Secondary plan Covered under the plan as an employee, retired employee or dependent The plan covering you as an employee or retired employee. The plan covering you as a dependent. Eligible for Medicare If you or a dependent have Medicare coverage, the rule above may be reversed. See the How to contact us for help section if you have questions. AL SG HCOC -2017 -PPO 01 OFF -HIX 66 NV 2017 COB rules for dependent children Child of: Parents who are married or living together The \"birthday rule\" applies. The plan of the parent whose birthday+ (month and day only) falls earlier in the calendar year . +Same birthdays --the plan that has covered a parent longer is primary The plan of the parent born later in the year (month and day only)+. +Same birthdays --the plan that has covered a parent longer is primary Child of: Parents separated or divorced or not living together With court -order The plan of the parent whom the court said is responsible for health coverage. But if that parent has no coverage then the other spouse's plan. The plan of the other parent. But if that parent has no coverage, then his/her spouse's plan is primary. Child of: Parents separated or divorced or not living together - court -order states both parents are responsible for coverage or have joint custody Primary and secondary coverage is based on the birthday rule. Child of: Parents separated or divorced or not living together and there is no court -order The order of benefit payments is: The plan of the custodial parent pays first The plan of the spouse of the custodial parent (if any) pays second The plan of the noncustodial parent pays next The plan of the spouse of the noncustodial parent (if any) pays last Active or inactive employee The plan covering you as an active employee (or as a dependent of an active employee) is primary to a plan covering you as a laid off or retired employee (or as a dependent of a former employee). A plan that covers the person as a laid off or retired employee (or as a dependent of a former employee) is secondary to a plan that covers the person as an active employee (or as a dependent of an active employee). COBRA or state continuation The plan covering you as an employee or retiree, or the dependent of an employee or retiree, is primary to COBRA or state continuation coverage. COBRA or state continuation coverage is secondary to the plan that covers the person as an employee or retiree, or the dependent of an employee or retiree. Longer or shorter length of coverage If none of the above rules determine the order of payment, the plan that has covered the person longer is primary. Other rules do not apply If none of the above rules apply, the plans share expenses equally. AL SG HCOC -2017 -PPO 01 OFF -HIX 67 NV 2017 How are benefits paid? Primary plan The primary plan pays your claims as if there is no other health plan involved. Secondary plan The secondary plan calculates payment as if the primary plan did not exist and then applies that amount to any allowable expenses under the secondary plan that were not covered by the primary plan. The secondary plan will reduce payments so the total paym ents do not exceed 100% of the total allowable expense. Benefit reserve each family member has a separate benefit reserve for each calendar year The benefit reserve: Is made up of the amount that the secondary plan saved due to COB Is used to cover any unpaid allowable expenses Balance is erased at the end of each year How COB works with Medicare This section explains how the benefits under this plan work with benefits available under Medicare. When we say Medicare, we mean the health insurance provided by Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, as amended. It also includes Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) or similar coverage that is an authorized alternative to Parts A and B of Medicare. You are eligible for Medicare when you meet the crit eria for coverage because of: Your age A disability End stage renal disease (ESRD) You are also eligible for Medicare even if you are not enrolled because you: Refused it Dropped it Did not make a proper request for it When you are eligible for Medicare, the plan coordinates the benefits it pays with the benefits that Medicare pays. In the case of someone who is eligible but not covered, the plan may pay as if you are covered by Medicare and coordinate benefits with the benefits Medicare would have paid had you enrolled in Medicare. Sometimes, this plan is the primary plan, which means that the plan pays benefits before Medicare pays benefits. Sometimes, this plan is the secondary plan, and pays benefits after Medicare or after an amount that Medicare would have paid if you were covered. AL SG HCOC -2017 -PPO 01 OFF -HIX 68 NV 2017 Who pays first? If you are eligible due to age and have group health plan coverage based on your or your spouse's current employment and: Primary plan Secondary plan The employer has 20 or more employees Your plan Medicare You are retired Medicare Your plan If you have Medicare because of: End stage renal disease (ESRD) Your plan will pay first for the first 30 months. Medicare will pay first after this 30 month period. Medicare Your plan A disability other than ESRD and your employer has more than 100 employees Your plan Medicare Note regarding ESRD: If you were already eligible for Medicare due to age and then became eligible due to ESRD, Medicare will remain your primary plan and this plan will be secondary. This plan is secondary to Medicare in all other circumstances. How are benefits paid? We are primary We pay your claims as if there is no Medicare coverage. Medicare is Primary We calculate our benefit as if there were no Medicare coverage and reduce our benefit so that when combined with the Medicare payment, the total payment is no more than 100% of the allowable expense. Charges that satisfy your Part B deductible will be applied in the order received. We will apply the largest charge first when two or more charges are received at the same time. Other health coverage updates - contact information You should contact us if you have any changes to your other coverage. We want to be sure our records are accurate so your claims are processed correctly. See the How to contact us for help section for details. Right to receive and release needed information We have the right to release or obtain any information we need for COB purposes. That includes information we need to recover any payments from your other health plans. Right to pay another carrier Sometimes another plan pays something we would have paid under your plan. When that happens, we will pay your plan benefit to the other plan. Right of recovery If we pay more than we should have under the COB rules, we may recover the excess from: Any person we paid or for whom we paid Any other plan that is responsible under these COB rules AL SG HCOC -2017 -PPO 01 OFF -HIX 69 NV 2017 When coverage ends Coverage can end for a number of reasons.

In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay up to $ 110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were n ot sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Administrator. If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal cou rt. In addition, if you disagree with the Plan's decision or lack thereof concerning the status of a domestic relations order or a medical child support order, you may file suit in a federal court. If it should happen that plan fiduciaries misuse the Plan's money or if you are discriminated against for asserting your righ ts, you may seek assi stance from the U.S. Department of Labor or you may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous. Assistance with Your Questions If you have any questions about your Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, you should contact: the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory; or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington D.C. 20210. You may also obtain certain publications about your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hotline of t he Employee Benefits Security Administration. Statement of Rights under the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act Under federal law, group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group health insurance coverage generally may not restrict benefits for any hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth for the mother or newborn child to less t han 48 hours following a vaginal delivery, or less than 96 hours following a delivery by cesarean section. However, the plan or issuer may pay for a shorter stay if the attending provider (e.g., your physician, nurse midwife, or physician assistant), af ter consultation with the mother, discharges the mother or newborn earlier. Also, under federal law, plans and issuers may not se t the level of benefits or out -of-pocket costs so that any later portion of the 48 -hour (or 96 -hour) stay is treated in a manner less favorable to the mother or newborn than any earlier portion of the stay. In addition, a plan or issuer may not, under fed eral law, require that you, your physician, or other health care provider obtain authorization for prescribing a length of stay of up to 48 hours (or 96 hours). However, you may be required to obtain precertification for any days of confinement that exceed 48 hours (or 96 hours). For information on precertification, contact your plan administrator.

IMPORTANT HEALTH CARE REFORM NOTICES CHOICE OF PROVIDER If your Aetna plan generally requires or allows the designation of a primary care provider, you have the right to designate a ny primary care provider who participates in our network and who is available to accept you or your family members. If the plan or health insurance coverage designates a primary care provider automatically, then until you make this designation, Aetna designates one for you. For information on how to select a primary c are provider, and for a list of the participating primary care providers, contact your Employer or, if you are a current member, your Aetna contact number on the back of your ID card. If your Aetna plan allows for the designation of a primary care provide r for a child, you may designate a pediatrician as the primary care provider. If your Aetna plan provides coverage for obstetric or gynecological care and requires the designation of a primary care provider then you do not need prior authorization from Aetna or from any other person (including a primary care provider) in order to obtain access to obstetrical or gynecological care from a health care professional in our network who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology. The health care professional, how ever, may be required to comply with certain procedures, including obtaining prior authorization for certain services, following a pre -approved treatment plan, or procedures for making referrals. For a list of participating health care professionals who s pecialize in obstetrics or gynecology, contact your Employer or, if you are a current member, your Aetna contact number on the back of your ID card. Important Information about the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Non -discrimination Rule The Office of Civil Rights recently issued a Non -discrimination Rule in response to Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Section 1557 prohibits discrimination because of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability in health -related insurance or other health -related coverage. This applies to Aetna. Changes to health insurance plans are effective on the first day of the policy or plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2017. Some language changes may not be in the enclosed certificate of co verage or policy. This may be because the language is still under official review for approval. See the Important note below for how this affects your policy or plan. Important note: We will comply with the requirements of the Rule for all new and renewi ng policies or plans with an effective date on or after January 1, 2017. Below is a summary of some of the recent Non -discrimination Rule changes. An insurer covered by the Rule that provides or administers health -related insurance or other health -related coverage: Shall not: o Cancel, limit or refuse to issue or renew a policy or plan o Deny or limit coverage of a claim o Apply additional cost sharing to a person because of race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability. Shall not: o Deny or limit coverage o Deny or limit coverage of a claim o Apply additional cost sharing to a transgender person, if it results in discrimination against that person. Shall not exclude or limit health services related to gender transition. Aetna is the brand name used for products and services provided by one or more of the Aetna group of subsidiary companies, including Aetna Life Insurance Company, Coventry Health Care plans and their affiliates. Aetna companies that receive funds from the federal Department of Health and Human Services are subject to the Rule. Continuation of Coverage During an Approved Leave of Absence Granted to Comply With Federal Law Note: This sub -section applies to the Plan if your Employer employs 50 or more employees as determined by a formula defined by federal law. Check with your Employer to determine if FMLA applies to the Plan. This continuation of coverage section applies only for the period of any approved family or medical leave (approved FMLA leave) required by Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA). If your Employer grants you an approved FMLA leave for a period in excess of the period required by FMLA, any continuation of coverage during that excess period will be subject to prior written agreement between Aetna and your Employer. If your Employer grants you an approved FMLA leave in accordance with FMLA, you may, during the continuance of such approved FMLA leave, continue Health Expense Benefits for you and your eligible dependents. At the time you request the le ave, you must agree to make any contributions required by your Employer to continue coverage. Your Employer must continue to make premium payments. If Health Expense Benefits has reduction rules applicable by reason of age or retirement, Health Expense Be nefits will be subject to such rules while you are on FMLA leave. Coverage will not be continued beyond the first to occur of: The date you are required to make any contribution and you fail to do so. The date your Employer determines your approved FMLA leave is terminated. The date the coverage involved discontinues as to your eligible class. However, coverage for health expenses may be available to you under another plan sponsored by your Employer. Any coverage being continued for a dependent will not be continued beyond the date it would otherwise terminate. If Health Expense Benefits terminate because your approved FMLA leave is deemed terminated by your Employer, you may, on the date of such termination, be eligible for Continuation Under Federal L aw on the same terms as though your employment terminated, other than for gross misconduct, on such date. If the group contract provides any other continuation of coverage (for example, upon termination of employment, death, divorce or ceasing to be a defi ned dependent), you (or your eligible dependents) may be eligible for such continuation on the date your Employer determines your approved FMLA leave is terminated or the date of the event for which the continuation is available. If you acquire a new depe ndent while your coverage is continued during an approved FMLA leave, the dependent will be eligible for the continued coverage on the same terms as would be applicable if you were actively at work, not on an approved FMLA leave. If you return to work for your Employer following the date your Employer determines the approved FMLA leave is terminated, your coverage under the group contract will be in force as though you had continued in active employment rather than going on an approved FMLA leave provided you make request for such coverage within 31 days of the date your Employer determines the approved FMLA leave to be terminated. If you do not make such request within 31 days, coverage will again be effective under the group contract only if and when Aetn a gives its written consent. If any coverage being continued terminates because your Employer determines the approved FMLA leave is terminated, any Conversion Privilege will be available on the same terms as though your employment had terminated on the da te your Employer determines the approved FMLA leave is terminated.
