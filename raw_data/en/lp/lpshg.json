Insulin is a hormone that aids the movement of glucose from meals into your cells for energy. The body's production of insulin or its use of insulin might be insufficient at times. Glucose is able to get into cells and remain in the blood as a result. Blood sugar levels rise as a consequence. There are three primary types of diabetes: Type 1, Type 2, and gestational diabetes. [Type 1 diabetes](https://diabetesmantra.com/type-1-diabetes/) is caused by the immune system's attack on the cells that manufacture insulin, a hormone that aids in the utilization and storage of glucose. [Type 2 diabetes](https://diabetesmantra.com/type-2-diabetes/) occurs when the body's ability to use insulin is lost. [Gestational diabetes](https://diabetesmantra.com/gestational-diabetes/) is a disease that pregnant women get when their bodies aren't able to create and utilize insulin properly during pregnancy.
