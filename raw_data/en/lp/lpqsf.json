Vaidya Parla Jayagopal is one of the most gifted and beautiful spirited ayurvedic doctors and teacher I have met and worked with. Not only does he successfully treat my health issues but I truly feel it is his greatest passion, intention and talent to make you believe in your own power to heal oneself and to inspire you to further participate in making positive change out there. I can only highly recommend his professional expertise, insight and highly intuitive treatment. Namaste Hace tres anos fui diagnosticada de mama por lo que me reliazaron 10 radiaciones mas. I initially went to see Vaidya Jay at the request of my daughter. She had been to him and couldn't say enough good things about him. I was apprehensive at first. I'm a middle aged woman who was overweight, high cholesterol, and heading toward pre diabetes. Upon meeting Vaidya Jay, he puts you at ease right away. He listens very patiently, and has a way that I've never encountered with any other Vaidya of breaking everything down for you. He gets to the root of the problem which in return everything begins to make sense and falls into place.
