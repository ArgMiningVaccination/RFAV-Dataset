So here I am to clear the doubts and myths flying around. The answer is simply a Yes. In fact, one should even try to do acupuncture more after the vaccination. Here's why. Side effects of vaccination are 'heaty' in nature The side effects of vaccination are mostly high fever and many also claim that they experience cramps, headaches, aches and pains at many body parts. These are more towards the signs that inflammation are rampant in the body. And it does make sense as the body is creating antibodies against the pseudo virus injected into our body. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the nature of such inflammatory symptoms is Yang and heaty in nature. The heatiness resulted from the inflammation can dry many tissues in the body, causing cramps and aches and pains as the tissues get dehydrated and blood flow is blocked. Side effects of vaccination affect the Heart more Many people also claim that they feel more heart palpitations and anxiety after the vaccination. This is usually the case especially when something foreign enters the body as the body goes into a fight response, which is needed to manufacture the antibodies against whatever we are defending against. Definitely and obviously, this will have burden on the Heart organ. Acupuncture can help to clear the Heaty side effects after vaccination There are acupoints on the body that when combined correctly can help to cool the body down. Hence alleviating the side effects of Heatiness after vaccination. Also, with the right techniques, Acupuncture can either warm or cool the body. This is through years of practice and really is dependent on who your doctor is. In Chinese we have a term of the cooling technique called which literally means Cooling Through the Heavens. Acupuncture can calm the Heart It is well known that Acupuncture can calm the nerves. In TCM terms, nerves involve the Heart and the mind. So if there are any symptoms of heart palpitations or [anxiety](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-anxiety), acupuncture with the right doctor is definitely the one thing to go for.
