The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 6 By Madeline Strong Diehl I think most people would agree that the pandemic has made a lot of things that we used to take for granted much more complicated. For example: every time I go grocery shopping now, I feel I am putting my health at risk. Because of staffing shortages, I know I'm probably going to have to wait in line for a long time and end up in a DIY check-out lane\u2014and those machines, for whatever reason, hate me. They spew out a constant stream of commands and demands that I can never understand. If I had any feelings of peace and harmony when I entered the store, I know they will be gone by the time I leave. Except, more recently, I have discovered a way to maintain my composure (and dare I say my humanity?) no matter how much the machines revile and abuse me. That is what I am going to share with you today. First, let's review what we all are up against in this situation. We are dealing with machines known in the business as \"kiosks.\" To me, the word sounds vaguely Scandinavian, like \"Ikea,\" or \"solkatt.\" (I just picked that one out of the dictionary; it's Swedish for \"when the sun reflects off your watch\". No, I am not kidding. You can look it up yourself, in fact; I think it's a handy word that all of us should incorporate into our vocabulary.) If you're like me, you've been socialized to believe that everything Scandanavian is cool. But, in the case of \"kiosks,\" they are not Scandanavian, and they are not cool. If you fall into the trap of believing they are cool, you should be aware that you have been deceived, because using a kiosk means that you are the one having to do all the work! When you are working with kiosks, you must remember that they are machines that are completely unperturbed by anything you might say or do to them to make them stop their rude and insulting behavior. You can beg, plead, curse, or bargain, and none of this will have any effect. They are not scared by threats and they're impervious to bribes. Now let's examine the language they use to gain power over us. (For the purposes of this story, I will call the kiosk \"Stan.\") After waiting in line for a long, long time, when I finally reach Stan, he greets me with false AI friendliness and enthusiasm, and says: \"Welcome valued customer!!! Please scan your membership card. Now scan your items and put them in the bag. Sorry. I didn't see that. Please take the item out of the bag and scan it again. I said scan your item and put it in the bag. Now take the item out of the bag and scan it. What was that? I couldn't see it. Please place the item on the scanner and type in the name of the item. What? There's no such thing as that, dummy! Try again! Obviously, you flunked spelling. Please select a picture of the item. What? You still can't get this right? Why are you taking so long? What's the matter? Are you finished? Now choose your method of payment. You're not done? Then call the cashier for help. What? There is no cashier? Then I suggest you run out of the store screaming so I can berate and frustrate the next customer in line. GOOD BYE! ... \"Welcome valued customer!\" So, now I know you're probably asking, what does this all have to do with kindness? Well, our ability to be resilient and maintain our composure when dealing with the Stans of this world is directly related to: (a) how much sleep we had the night before, (b) how long we have been waiting in line, and (c) our experience while waiting in line. By the time we get to Stan, we have zero control over factors (a) and (b), but I have learned that we have a lot of control over (c), our experience in line. If we learn how to be kind in the face of adversity in the grocery store, I believe it's possible we can be part of a revolution of kindness that can have a much greater impact. In fact, I know that there are tens of thousands of people all around the world who also believe this! They are all members of the Random Acts of Kindness Foundation, which is based on the belief that kindness is a skill that can be taught and developed. On its website, randomactsofkindness.org, it provides numerous suggestions for how to become a \"raktivist\"\u2014someone who is constantly on the lookout for ways to be kind and thereby help to bring about a revolution of kindness. According to the website, scientists have determined that acts of kindness confer increased physical, emotional, and psychological wellbeing not just to the recipient, but also to the \"raktivist.\" Kindness is also contagious; observing acts of kindness also sets off a domino effect that causes observers to participate in kindness and benefit from kindness, too. And participating in o r observing acts of kindness set off a cascade of happiness drugs in the brain such as oxytocin and endorphins. Here is the story of what happened during my first experiment with kindness, before I discovered the international social movement established to promote it. (It's also the story of how I discovered how much I had let the pandemic compromise my sense of humanity, and I am embarrassed to tell it for that reason!) I was in line at my local grocery store feeling my usual ambivalence because each step forward brought me closer to home, but also one step closer to having to deal with Stan. And on this particular night there was a woman in her late 20s directly behind me who was trying, unsuccessfully, to comfort a baby and a toddler who were both crying inconsolably. And as their crying reached a crescendo, I found myself turning into my version of the CRABBY QUEEN, and wondering Why can't this woman get her children to stop crying? Doesn't she realize that she's inconveniencing all the rest of us and putting us all on edge while we're all standing less than six feet away from each other? If this were a movie theater, or church, wouldn't she have to leave? I looked around and everyone else's faces looked angry and impatient, too. Suddenly, it struck me how much I have allowed my survival instinct, my reptilian brain, to take over during the pandemic. I remembered what it was like to have to take a baby and a toddler shopping with me, hoping against hope that I could make it in and out the door before they both melted down completely. I remembered that I used to be a very different person\u2014and I vowed to become that person again. I remembered a quote from my hero, the Dalai Lama XIV: \"Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible. And be kinder than necessary.\" So, I turned around and said to the woman: \"Please. I remember what that's like! Why don't you go ahead of me in line?\" At first she looked incredulous, then hopeful, then relieved, and she moved forward with a bounce in her step, and then I saw the miracle happen. Because the face of the next person in front of me softened, and he told the young mother to go ahead of him, and the next person did, too, and the next, and lo and behold, the woman got to the front of the line within about five minutes total. And if that wasn't proof enough that kindness was still alive and well in the world, the woman in the very front of the line let the mother go ahead of her, too, and even scanned all of the mom's groceries for her, and the mom was out the door within about eight minutes total. Eureka! What I witnessed that night was the scientifically proven domino effect of kindness. I felt delirious with happiness and joy! When I looked at my fellow customers now, they were all chatting and joking with each other with smiles on their faces! (For science has proven that kindness is contagious.) It still took me a long time to reach Stan, but when he treated me with the usual sadistic scorn and abuse, I just let it roll right off my back and told him, \"Have a nice day!\" That night I discovered the Random Acts of Kindness Foundation, and now I just need to help persuade millions of other people to become raktivists. The Foundation doesn't want your money; it just wants to help you celebrate kindness in everyday life. The best part of all\u2014it's for your own benefit. As the website says, \"When you are kind to another person, your brain's pleasure and reward centers light up, as if you were the recipient of the good deed\u2014not the giver. This phenomenon is called the 'helper's high.'\" World Kindness Day is November 13 th, but don't wait until then to give it a try!

Despite the many crises that Americans and people throughout the world are confronting, it seemed clear to me that climate change dwarfed them all. It is, ultimately, perhaps the only genuinely global existential crisis, impacting every living being on the planet. Nevertheless, I felt I could not ignore the other emergencies, catastrophes, and calamities that we are also facing, because many of them either directly affect climate change, are affected by it, impair our efforts to mitigate it, or all of the above. I began writing this essay on July 11. As you read it now, it's a couple of months later. Do you recall the three weeks and some of the crises-du-jour preceding that date? Permit me, dear reader, to refresh your memory. There were the Supreme Court's rulings on gun rights, abortion, and limiting the EPA's power to reduce power plant emissions. Additionally, some of the Justices made thinly veiled threats of perhaps even more draconian decisions to come. Then there was the July 4th Highland Park shootings, triggering excruciating memories of the Uvalde and Buffalo massacres, and all the others before them. The Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the US Capitol was exhuming and examining the sordid and by now almost buried details of that traumatic day. The war in Ukraine was still raging, the threat of it exploding into a worldwide conflagration still looming, and its damaging effects on energy shortages and hunger in many parts of the world still unresolved. The pandemic, depending on which expert's crystal ball was Windexed the clearest, had either eased, entered an endemic stage or, with the recent advent of the most contagious variants yet, about to flare into its maximally dangerous phase to date. High inflation in the US and throughout the world was further squeezing many people already in the grip of poverty. What a dismaying, disheartening list. And a tragically abbreviated one at that. Oh yes, and don't forget climate change. After I finished writing the first draft of the previous paragraphs, I felt thoroughly enervated. I looked at that list and thought, \"No one will want to read this. And especially, no one will want to read that climate change may be even more daunting than all of these issues, and that all of these are likely to make addressing climate change even more difficult.\" And then, unexpectedly, I heard a little voice singing a brief blues lyric in the back of my head. \"A thimbleful of good news, a bucketful of bad.\" Thinking that a line that good likely did not originate with me, I immediately Googled it. And found to my happy surprise, that in fact it had. The closest one that I found to it was by Henri Matisse who supposedly said, \"A thimbleful of red is redder than a bucketful.\" Which is, I'm sure, good advice for painters but seemed, at first, not at all what my inner lyricist was singin' about. So, I asked my interior songsmith-in-residence for an encore and he doubled down with this. \"A bucketful of bad news, a barrelful of worse.\" \"That's more like it,\" I thought sourly. The original line had seemed, in my mood of the moment, Pollyannic, too good to be true. I couldn't see, \"A thimbleful of good,\" on that list\u2014or on any other I could conjure. I only saw buckets and barrels. And then, as if on que, a notification popped up on my laptop screen. \"Breaking News from the Washington Post.\" Glad for the distraction, I opened the email. And immediately felt\u2014literally, physically felt\u2014different. My mood, my state, suddenly reoriented 180 degrees. All because I found myself looking at the first picture the James Webb Space Telescope had sent back from its parking spot a million miles from Earth.It was breathtaking! A Jackson Pollack style spattering of innumerable galaxies on a black field\u2014an absolutely jam packed view of an infinitesimally tiny fraction of the universe, a magnificent postcard from the edge of time. I was gobsmacked. I stared at the screen through wet eyes. It literally took me out of this world. As Dante wrote at the end of The Inferno, \"We beheld through a round aperture/Some of the beauteous things that Heaven doth bear;/Thence we came forth to behold the stars again.\" None of the items on the crises list I'd just compiled had changed. None of the issues were clarified, mended, or resolved by the sight of that picture. Nothing in the world had changed. But I had.I got up from my desk and headed outside for a walk. My neighbor was gathering daisies from her garden to bring into her house. The daisies looked especially lovely in the sunset's fading light. I remarked on them and she said, \"Yeah, I need something cheerful to bring inside.\" I nodded, \"I know what you mean.\" And told her about the Webb photo I'd just seen, how beautiful it was, how it had uplifted me. She said she'd look for it as soon as she went inside. A single picture, a handful of daisies. Maybe Matisse's maxim, \"A thimbleful of red is redder than a bucketful\" applied in this respect also. Maybe a thimbleful of good can be more powerful than a bucketful, or even a barrelful of bad. Maybe Webb's shining example of international cooperation, of technological miracle-making (scientists from many parts of the world contributed to Webb, and of course the accumulation of thousands of years of human wisdom underpinned the entire endeavor), might help inspire us in solving our difficulties closer to home. The next day there were more pictures from Webb, each one more spectacular, more glorious than the next. One of them was a side-by-side comparison of pictures taken of the same speck of sky by the Hubble telescope and by Webb. By looking deeper, Webb had been able to see so much more, and so much clearer; had uncovered what had not been visible before. Perhaps that's also what is needed here on Earth. Maybe it will help if we try to look deeper and try to understand more about each other and the challenges we face. We, the planet, and everything living on it will, I sadly fear, sink deeper into the inferno that is climate change before we rise from that hell and heal. (I am not willing to entertain the possibility that we won't.) Of course, I am by no means suggesting that simply feeling uplifted and energized by Webb's astounding accomplishments\u2014or by any other joyful experience\u2014will alleviate climate change. I know that I must continue, and even increase my efforts to be mindful of my actions, to do my small part to tread lightly on the Earth, to advocate on her behalf, to value her gifts. I respectfully submit that we all must. But my experience with the Webb photo on July 11 reminded me that it is in touching joy\u2014even just a thimbleful of joy, in the myriad and unique ways we all have\u2014that we will find the strength to do those things. By Sandor SlomovitsA Moment of JoyA Moment of Joy What a dismaying, disheartening list. And a tragically abbreviated one at that. Oh yes, and don't forget climate change. And then, unexpectedly, I heard a little voice singing brief blues lyric in the back of my head. \"A thimbleful of good news, a bucketful of bad.\"My mood, my state, suddenly reoriented 180 degrees. All because I found myself looking at the first picture the James Webb Space Telescope had sent back from its parking spot a million miles from Earth. But my experience with the Webb photo on July 11 reminded me that it is in touching joy\u2014 even just a thimbleful of joy, in the myriad and unique ways we all have\u2014 that we will find the strength to do those things. July 11, 2017. Yesterday we went to the home of Jackie Whisperstep to help clear about a quarter acre of the land surrounding her house. It is filled with tightly packed Amazon weeds, each one 10' tall. Their stalks are like hard bamboo, about 3\" in diameter. It is 103 degrees. I drag bundles of these weeds out of the area all day, taking long breaks for water and lunch. The youth work endlessly with few breaks, by choice. The skin on my hands looks like that of a Native American elder. I look at them and think, \"these are getting to be the kinds of hands I would want to photograph for the stories they hold. But now that they are my own, I don't want to photograph them.\" I spend quite a bit of time talking with Jackie. She brings me a cup of hot coffee when she sees me panting, my face ablaze from the heat. \"Drink it, she said,\" it will cool you off. I did, so as not to offend. I instantly felt revived. \"What kind of magic coffee is this?\" I asked. \"Dunkin Donuts,\" she said. \"With some Hazelnut Coffeemate in it.\"Jackie Whisperstep has her master's in social work from Walla-Walla University in Washington. She is retired, slightly younger than me. Her husband died last year; his hat remains on the table next to his worn leather recliner. Her dog and cat, Milo and Otis, wander reluctantly outside as we work, moving to stay in the ever-moving shade. I asked her what she planned to do with the land once it was cleared. She told me we were not clearing the land to build or plant; the fires that come in the late summer will ignite her house if they are not removed.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 8 By Marie Noelle Duquette In 1994, I watched A River Runs Through It while I was nine months pregnant. It was filmed in Montana. As the credits rolled, I thought, \"That is one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen.\" I named the baby I was carrying, Chase Montana. He wrote an essay in college that began: \"My mother named me after a place she had never been. She said I would go there someday.\" In 2017, Chase and I both went to Montana, on separate trips. I accompanied four youth from our church and their two young adult leaders. We stayed on the reservation with seventy high school youth, their chaperones, and Crow leaders who acted as hosts. What follows are excerpts from my journal during that time. July 9, 2017 \"I am the oldest one here. This is new to me. I will need to remember my role if I am to survive this heat. I am the one who captures stories and weaves them together for the telling\u2014I couldn't force myself to work harder than I was able and pass out or get heat stroke. Earlier this evening, we gathered with other church groups in a small classroom in the elementary school where we are staying to engage in The Blanket Exercise, a participatory history lesson developed in collaboration with Indigenous Elders and educators. Its purpose is to foster truth, understanding, respect, and reconciliation among Indigenous and non-indigenous peoples.July 10, 2017. Chase, the part of the Crow reservation on which we are staying is exactly what you prepared me for\u2014abject poverty. Our base camp is an elementary school which many communities we are accustomed to living in would likely demolish without so much as a vote. I think of the well-coiffed communities of our country with typical incremental increases in taxes for things like new turf on the football field or new technology in the library\u2014how they are often disputed, but nearly always passed. This school needs paint, new toilets, and a mirror in the bathroom would be nice. On the doors of the main entrance is a black bumper sticker with block white letters spelling out: METH IS DEATH / NOT EVEN ONCE. Johnny is the security guard on hand. He is all Crow: skin that looks like weathered leather with a thick head of hair three inches tall. I got locked out of the building last night and Johnny was the one to open the steel door after my muted knocks. I thanked him. His reply, \"I saw you go to your car to get your water bottle.\" I didn't see him see me . Pulling Weeds in Crow, Montana He wrote an essay in college that began: \"My mother named me after a place she had never been. She said I would go there someday.\" In 2017, Chase and I both went to Montana, on separate trips. A leader randomly walked through the middle, giving out colored index cards. I was handed a yellow card which meant I was killed by smallpox. I felt indignant when they handed me the card; I had only just begun to play the game.o oo o First, we were instructed to stand somewhere on one of the old blankets that covered the floor . The blankets represented land. Once assembled, community elders read as voices of the Native Americans; leaders from Youthworks, the group who had organized the trip, read the parts written for the U.S. Government. The Native American voices spoke far less. As these narrators moved us through the story, they picked up blankets so that we had to move closer and closer to one another to share the small amount of \"land\" that was left. A leader randomly walked through the middle, giving out colored index cards. I was handed a yellow card which meant I was killed by smallpox. I felt indignant when they handed me the card; I had only just begun to play the game. How could I die so soon from a disease for which we now have vaccines? When the game was over, a Lakota elder lead a discussion about the experience. He began by quoting a character in the book, The Wolf at Twilight. \"I'm not saying any of this is your fault or even that your grandparents did any of it. I'm saying it happened, and it happened on your people's watch. You're the one who benefited from it. It doesn't matter that you're way downstream from the actual events. You're still drinking the water. I don't care if you feel guilty. I just care that you take some responsibility. Responsibility is about what you do now, not about feeling bad about what happened in the past. You can't erase the footprints that have already been made. What you've got to do is take a close look at those footprints and make sure you're more careful where you walk in the future.\" It w as hard not to feel ashamed of our history; it was hard to look directly at him or at one another. \"So,\" the elder said. \"Let's talk about what it means to be careful about where we walk in the future.\" Photo by Marie Noelle DuquettteOn the night of each new moon and each full moon, Wrex and nine to eleven other men in his tribe enter the lodge to pray and experience the cleansing of impurities from their bodies. Wrex explained that this detoxifying process gives the men clarity of vision and insight. \"In this way,\" he said, \"We pray in community and as individuals. And we pray simultaneously with our bodies, our minds, and our spirit. If you do not pray in this way,\" he cautioned, \"you will not live in balance.\" Wrex said that the sweat lodge ceremony is not to be taken lightly. \"It is transformative,\" he said. \"Those who arrive angry, find calm. Those who are lazy, become energized. Those who are without direction, may be given guidance. Those who are weak, gain strength. The wisdom we receive in the Sweat Ceremony, comes from the words we say to one another. That is why even those who do not receive a specific answer must still come; it may be that they will be the one who receives the words to speak to another in need.\" We left the beaten path that others in our group followed, winding our way through the mountains at dusk, listening to playlists the youth took turns offering. During \"The Dark Side of The Moon,\" we happened on a lake so calm it commanded us to be still.We sip our coffee in silence, watching the youth make their way in and out of the Amazon weeds, work gloves covering strong hands that carry bundle after heavy bundle to the truck bed so we can drive them to a far corner of the reservation. \"I prayed every day that God would send people to help clear the weeds,\" she said. \"Thank you.\" Later that afternoon, we gathered to hear Wrex, an elder, explain the process of a Sweat Ceremony. He introduced himself, \"W-R-E-X, the W is silent.\" He chuckled, clearly pleased with his joke. We were sitting in a large circle facing his sweat lodge. We were outdoors, but inside a fence-wall that was constructed of long birch branches, upon which thick blankets, animal hides, and bundles of sage and chokecherry leaves hung. The effect was to be enclosed in an open-air fortress, hidden in plain sight. We had passed by this sweat lodge many times during the week while clearing Jackie's land. We had looked at it from a treeline above when we carried truckloads of weeds to a dump. We never saw it. The lodge itself, like the fence-wall surrounding it, was made of long sturdy branches that were bent to form the skeleton of a tent shaped like an eagle. Wrex reached down and grabbed the corner of an animal pelt, flipping it up on to the top of the lodge to show the doorway. A twin doorway was on the other side so that one could have crawled into and through the lodge, right out the back door. Just inside to the right of the doorway was a pit about three feet deep and three feet wide, filled with pieces of fist-sized sandstone. Sage and sweetgrass were scattered on the limbs to form the roof. Wrex said, \"During the ceremony, participants take turns pouring ladles of water onto these rocks, adding steam to the heat of the lodge.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 9 The skin on my hands looks like that of a Native American elder. I look at them and think, \"these are getting to be the kinds of hands I would want to photograph for the stories they hold. But now that they are my own, I don't want to photograph them.\" I think about Jackie Whisperstep and the fragility of her house given the heartiness of the weeds that grow too near it. And I long to go back, to stand with those to whom we made promises we did not keep.o oo o I was viscerally aware, that the United States of America, with the help of the Supreme Court, has broken every single treaty it signed with our indigenous siblings. The Supreme Court recently has upended environmental law. Fire season in the dry, western states has begun. I think about Jackie Whisperstep and the fragility of her house given the heartiness of the weeds that grow too near it. And I long to go back, to stand with those to whom we made promises we did not keep. The definition of faith is being sure of what we hope for, and certain of things we cannot see. When I apply this definition, I realize my faith remains because I hope for a world bigger than I can see or understand; a world where justice is proactive. And I am certain that we were gifted by the stories we experienced in the Crow community, which invite us to consider more carefully where we walk. And why.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 10 As I write this the days are lengthening, the sun riding high in the sky, and the expansiveness of summer stretches before me\u2014though the days seem to be filling fast. So much to cram in here, in Michigan, where summer is the fleetest season: lake time, picnics, parties, peony blooms, and cicada chirps, fireflies and star showers, light until late in the evening and 4 a.m. birdsong. Long, hot, humid-filled days and hopefully, lots of water play. But you will be reading this after all that has passed, and the days shorten. I am always surprised how soon the dark comes in late August, how quickly the dusk rises, how the trees begin their color change, their leaf drop. We turn on the lights and leave them on longer but keep rising at the same time\u2014or perhaps even earlier now that school routines are back in place. Though my business is not on the school cycle, in our community of three universities, a community college, and numerous public, private, and charter schools, the academic calendar creates the rhythmic foundation. Its ebb and flow grounds the cycles of traffic, society, culture, and even health access. This river flows greater in the fall and winter than in summer, in stark contrast to the natural world and our bodies natural rhythm. It's an almost perfect opposition\u2014the warm sun-filled days coincide with the rousing of birds and nature while the arrival of winter coincides with the rising of the window blinds, the glowing flash of artificial light, and pulling ourselves from the cozy nest of blankets and darkness. But ma ybe we shouldn't be so hasty. We live in a culture that's all about constant pushing, striving, reaching, accelerating, and growing. Nothing in the natural world does this. Plants leaf out, form flowers, bloom, fruit, and fade with the sunlight. Birds, bees, mammals, and amphibians all have their cycles of activity, fertility, and rest appropriate to their climate: times of slowness, times of busyness. Wh y don't we ? This question tugs my heart, particularly in 2022, as we look back at the past two years. There has been a lot written about the coronavirus pandemic by all types of talking heads: what does it mean, what do we do with it, how do we move beyond it? I'd like to offer a framing of it that comes from my love of mythology and story. Stories can aid us in times of struggle. We make meaning through story, but as Carl Jung pointed out, is that story a healing fiction, or a debilitating one? What story are you telling about the pandemic, about the last two years? I invite you to think of them as an initiation. Initiation is a threshold crossing: a ritual and ceremonial process that humanity uses constantly. Our long-ago ancestors initiated youth into adulthood through ceremony. Youth were prepared for months to survive the ritual, to leave their childhood behind, and return with the seeds of their adult self. Graduation, communion, bat/bar mitzvahs, baby and wedding showers all derive from this tradition. That nascent adult over time would become an elder to the next generation of youth. Initiation has three psychological and psychic components (I use psychic in the sense of soul, and psychological in the sense of our thoughts). First, it is a break from the world you knew before the initiatory event. Second, it is an alteration of your sense of self, and finally, you can never return to the world you left behind. It is meant to be a contained encounter with death.While historically initiation is a planned and prepared for event, there are also those that are not. Psychologist Francis Weller calls these \"rough initiations; when the bough breaks.\" The key difference between planned initiation and unplanned\u2014 there is no containment. When the bough breaks the cradle falls and you have no idea how to respond. Your spouse asks for a divorce. You lose your job. You receive a cancer diagnosis. You lose a loved one. You've been pushed off a cliff you didn't know was there, weren't told about, couldn't prepare for, nor even had an inkling it existed. Unlike prepared initiations, where there is planning, education, skills, and practices in place, your hands are empty. You find yourself away from the known world and dropped into....what? Think about these in the context of the coronavirus. Almost all of us were caught unaware, our lives overturned within weeks. Many of us were desperate for news and guidance to keep ourselves safe. Talk quickly turned to \"getting back to normal\" without any recognition that \"normal\" was gone. There is no longer a world where we don't know what it is like to have a global pandemic, where we don't know how it feels to have a novel disease upend our lives, where we don't see how differently we each respond to uncertainty, mystery, and stress. Whether we were ready or not, willing or not, initiation occurred. We broke away from the world \"before\" and can never return. Our culture, particularly our spiritual culture, focuses on ascension. \"Rise up!\" we hear. Meditate to leave your body and suffering behind, sweat out those difficult emotions, keep running, reach out. Our spirits rise, which is all well and good, but what about our soul? Do we have roots beneath that rising? Soul is earth. It is our bodies, it is the physical world we live in, our loved ones, our pets, all that is tangible and touchable. Soil on our palms, our gliding joints as we plant flowers to smell or vegetables to harvest, the taste of mint on the tongue, the soft brush of rose petals against our lips, the warm weight of a beloved's hand in ours, the silky fur of our cat, the delicious taste of our favorite food. Soul is interior, it is reaching in rather than out, it is paying attention to what arises from our guts, our passions, our hearts. Ancient Western philosophers placed sensation in the heart. Our aesthetic response, our response to physical beauty feeds our heart. Soul tracks our attention into the cave of ourselves, and if we go deep enough, we find the cave of memory. Soul takes us to places like Lascaux, the darkness where art and beauty were painted on the walls, celebrations and kinship with Others who share our planet. Soul asks us to face our bodies, befriend our physicality, our immanence, our being, and ultimately, our mortality. After over twenty years working with bodies, I know well how our culture of ascension works: it asks us to leave our bodies behind, to forget them, discipline them, or anesthetize them. Yet it is only through turning toward and attending to the body, and therefore the soul, that we can meet our needs, meet ourselves, be present in our lives and express our aliveness. Biologically, we have more receptors within our bodies than without, more nervous system connections below the skin than on top. I interpret this to mean that what happens within might just be as important as what happens without. One of the most difficult parts of turning our attention inward is noticing all the places we have neglected. It's like waking up from an illness only to find the house in disarray: dirty laundry everywhere, dishes stacked in the sink, and mail piled up. Feelings are often right at the door when we turn within, or exhaustion, pain, or loneliness. If we can stay with our discomfort and befriend what greets us, we return to the ability to choose our response. Take a moment right now to stop reading this and breathe. Sense what is within you from these words. Is your breathing fast or slow? Do you feel the support (chair, floor, bed) that is beneath your body? How much of your weight is resting there? Are you settled or are you lifting, ready to move? Breathe. Notice. Breathe. Notice. Breath. Notice. Wintering Within I am always surprised how soon the dark comes in late August, how quickly the dusk rises, how the trees begin their color change, their leaf drop. We live in a culture that's all about constant pushing, striving, reaching, accelerating, and growing. Nothing in the natural world does this. While historically initiation is a planned and prepared for event, there are also those that are not. After over twenty years working with bodies, I know well how our culture of ascension works: it asks us to leave our bodies behind, to forget them, discipline them, or anesthetize them. Yet it is only through turning toward and attending to the body, and therefore the soul, that we can meet our needs, meet ourselves, be present in our lives and express our aliveness. By Kirsten MowreyThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 11 As I wrote that, I felt my butt widen on the chair below me. I felt my ribcage expand more with each breath. I felt more weighted, present, and real. Bringing safety and connection to ourselves allows us to feel more alive. Being more alive not only enriches our experience of life\u2014it allows us the choice to respond to what happens in our lives. Joanna Macy, in her book Active Hope, writes of how we need two essential movement directions. One is to oppose those events in the world that are harmful, that don't enhance life, to say \"no\" to violence, pollution, or oppression, for example. But more of our psychic and psychological energy needs to be directed toward what we say \"yes\" to\u2014to life-nourishing and life-enhancing activities. It takes reflection and choice to actively move toward life. We cannot know the where or the what if we do not take the time for pausing, evaluating, weighing our energy levels and abilities, and then creating our intention. This is what winter is for. Autumn is the time of harvest, where we gather all that grew over the past year. Winter was traditionally about rest, repair, and pause. In settler communities you ate the food you had preserved in the autumn. Christian families and communities would gather for the great feast of Advent, while Pagans would celebrate the Winter Solstice, gathering close in the darkness. Indigenous communities would tell the winter stories, told only at the dark time of the year to feed the community in the cold. Life was slower. Where is our pause, our rest, our time in the dark now? Where is the time of inhaling, pausing, letting the body be heavy and slow? Where is the psychic soul space of moving into mystery, chaos, and the unknown of darkness to create anew for spring? We have left rest behind in the belief that we are unattached to nature. Rather than turning inward, we seek the anesthesia of constant doing, or the amnesia of distraction and exhaustion. Neither satisfies our craving within, the emptiness we feel in our souls. Getting present with winter also gives us a contained experience with a death not our own. We know winter will end, that the days will get longer. Can we allow ourselves to experience the death of the natural world around us as a model to become more comfortable with death itself? We all lost a part of ourselves in this Covid initiation, but death is only a part of the cycle. The tree in the park will lose its leaves and flush with green again in the spring. The riverside will turn brown and decay, and the ducks and geese will return to nest in the grasses. To show up in these times, in the world beyond the threshold of the coronavirus pandemic, we must be willing to be present with all that we are\u2014leaving no part behind on the trail we walked. Acting from our soul with our spirit, our darkness, and our light, welcoming in the rejected outcasts, we need everyone, and as much of ourselves as we can gather. What, when, and where brings you a sense of safety and connection? Is there a place, a person, or a time of day where you feel a safe harbor and ability to rest? Let the seasons guide our soulful journeys, let us harvest and then slow down, turn inward, and re-introduce us to ourselves. Who are you now, after these two, ground rumbling, culture tossing years? What surprised you about yourself, your friends, your relationships? What rose to sustain you, anchor you, and nourish you?

Ready for your next step?The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 12 Story and Photos By Hilary Nichols Where does music begin? When you're a musician, the search is inward. David Magumba realized that, \"Beyond inspiration, you do the work. You make it happen. As a songwriter, that is the effort I am making right now.\" When Magumba writes a piece, he sees the science of it. \"I line up as many of the parameters as I can before I dive in\u2014How do I want the lyrics to hit, the melodies to harmonize, and what instruments and why?\u2014until the voice of the piece begins to emerge.\" With a temperament for detail work, he is suited for the long hours alone, crafting a song into being. The devotion is worth it. It is undeniable. Music is his world. Magumba has been told, \"you have a gift,\" ever since he was small. He was advanced to primary in the church choir by age six at his Catholic school in Price Hill, near Cincinnati, Ohio. The area was tough, but his parents, having escaped Ida Amin's Uganda, found each other there, and the church became their safe haven. He followed his sisters into the choir, \"'cause that's what the cool kids did.\" The first time he opened his mouth and started singing, he found the response was bizarre. All he knew was that he was making people happy. He knows he was lucky to find music. Quickly, he became a professional, singing at weddings and funerals as early as first grade. \"Beyond inspiration, you do the work. You make it happen. As a songwriter, that is the effort I am making right now.\" -David MagumbaWe are lucky that his love of music remains local before his undeniable talent takes him to a bigger stage. He and I are sitting at Black Diesel Coffee House on a Tuesday morning, when he shares his performance schedule. He is keeping busy as an artist these days. He completed his roles in Dead Man Walking (U of M), La Boheme with the Detroit Opera House, Smokey Joe's Cafe with the Encore Musical Theater, and contributed to recordings with Emma McDermott and Hannah Baiardi, and S.N.O.T. chamber orchestra, (youtube.com/watch?v=Nj2rmvXYM-U) all while continuing to pursue his solo career. Kindred ConversationsKindred Conversations with Hilary Nichols David Magumba is a Singer-Songwriter, U-M Graduate, and an opera vocalist. Being a professional musician can be slow, methodical, and agonizing work. He entered the Vocal Performance major at the University of Michigan school of Theater and Dance after some false starts. Originally, he entered college in the business management department at Michigan State, which \"didn't work out at all.\" It was a job at Zingerman's that brought him to Ann Arbor where he enrolled initially at WCC. Still not it. The aha moment came with a realization that he should audition for the opera department at U-M, in order to fully develop his singing voice, which would take more training, which would take more funding. Once he auditioned, the school agreed, he was meant for the program, and did provide some support, though he paid his own way through most of his college career. But that doesn't mean this career comes easily. Being a professional musician can be slow, methodical, and agonizing work. \"I want to put my message in the best light that I can.\" To get the work out of his head, Magumba has had to learn to share the process. From the Amazin' Blue Acapella group, and theater and music writing workshops, he has finally found his home and family of fellow creatives. By creating this microcosm to collaborate with, the creation begins to flourish\u2014it grows and takes on a life of its own. \"It enlightens me to dig deeper and to be able to evaluate how I actually want to say what I mean in different ways. With these respected reflections the work is honed until it really hums,\" Magumba muses. So, it was at his standing Tuesday night gig at the Ypsilanti Cocktail Club where I first hear Magumba's voice. Even before we open the heavy doors and step into the stylish new club, I am struck by the strength of his tenor tone. He sits unassumingly behind his keyboard and fills the room with the contained power of a beautifully trained voice. Both effortless and all-enveloping, the elegant sound captivates the room. The audience, made up of many of Magumba's friends from the music department, hangs on every word. The support is palpable, but he doesn't take that for granted. Though his goal will take him to another city someday, he designs that his \"goal in Ann Arbor is to build my army of support to collaborate with.\" When the set ends, the microphone is unexpectedly, yet quickly, reattached to a karaoke set up and everyone steps up to join Magumba in a duet. With so much talent in this room, it is clear, Magumba's army is fully formed and unstoppable. And for now, we are lucky that his love of music remains local before his undeniable talent takes him to a bigger stage.

Our way of being, our common sense and social norms, the way we dream and scheme in sequence are all from story. This source, from our fables and fairytales read while tucked into bed, becomes our common thread. Much of the mythos that unifies a culture comes from a book, written by a writer, before it creeps into our shared psyche to become the substructure of society. We owe our very way of being to a writer. But where did the writers summon the stuff to scribe these sacred texts that we now trust to be our veritable lifeblood? For Alexander Weinstein, the visions that fill his pages come through the heart. The characters aren't recycled through a telescope to retell the details of our earthly life. These visitors enter through a portal from another realm. With his deft craft he makes them a home here, so that we can all meet the face of fantasy like a new friend or family member. Each story opens us to his unique world within a few words and we are swiftly enveloped into this new truth. It is in this cajoled familiarity that these characters can do their important work of influencing our perspectives effectively. Through the singular mind of the maker, all of our imaginations are made greater. Weinstein does not take that responsibility lightly. He shared, \"I find the spiritual in my present work is in the hearts of my characters, and in the aim of transcendence that underlines the characters and the plots of the stories.\" After years of deep work, studying with the Tepehu\u00e1n of the Sinaloa region of Mexico, and traveling with the Huichol Indians to their sacred Wirikuta, birthplace of their Gods, alongside his more current pursuits in Lakota ceremonies and loving kindness Buddhist practices, Weinstein delves the depths of consciousness to populate his landscapes. This time of introspection has clearly been precious work to meet the many wild wonderings. His theory might seem far out, but he posits that a writer must spend the time in the quiet groves and fairy forests listening \"in hopes that the unseen might decide to enchant and whisper tales of the sacred into the storyteller's slumbering ear.\" Some stories are made up and others are a gift from the \"shared consciousness from an unseen world.\" Weinstein has been listening for a long time. He has been writing since third grade. Handwriting reams of pages with his first drafts, before the countless hours spent honing that brilliant initial blast, through the miasma of doubts and drudgery until eventually it shines again, with that initial sense of assuredness. Now a full professor of Creative Writing at Siena Heights University, and the founding director of the Martha's Vineyard Institute of Creative Writing, Weinstein is a youthful spirit, handsome in his middle years with a well-earned gravitas. He has been living in Ann Arbor for 12 years, in a current cabin-styled home with his new wife and their blended family for a few years. I joined him there on the back porch, at the last house on a dead end, not far from downtown. The yard is surrounded by wild woods, with a slope that leads to a small swimming lake. Spending time in this nature is now a big part of the spiritual practice that fuels his fiction. His first short story collection, Children of the New World , was named notable literature by NPR, NY Times, and Electric Literature . He is a recipient of the The stories in his newest collection, Universal Love, summon surprising worlds in an instant. Each might seem bleak at first in this style of science fiction or, more aptly, speculative fiction, but on a deeper read the stories are filled with heart and hope. The other worldly characters encounter unfamiliar conflicts but transcend their troubled souls in the same ways we might. Cautionary tales, it could be called, and I do hope we take heed before our current trends collide with these fuzzy future tellings. \"It is realism but just a little further than we are right now. Holographic parenting is happening. The dystopia world is mirroring my stories, in some unsettling ways it seems.\" As the author taps into the gestalt of the moment, does fiction report on or determine our reality? That is the query. I for one hope to steer away from a virtual world where our oxygen comes from tanks, and our bots struggle with addictions, too. Lately, Alexander Weinstein is exploring a more utopic vision, and with his powerful force of fiction, our future just might be bettered by his far out and outstanding imaginings. KKCCThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 14 Living Outside My Comfort Zone By Julie Kouyate Photos by Hilary Nichols Upon reflecting on \"a single time\" that I have moved outside of my zone of comfort, I am somewhat stumped. I realized while considering this topic that I virtually live outside of my comfort zone. My life is what I call \"living on a prayer.\" I work in the healing industry and have been a self-employed woman for well over 20 years of my 23 years of healing service. I don't know where my next clients will come from, or how my week of work will look until I'm living that week. I don't have a salary. I have had my babies at home despite the well-wishers making sure I knew how close to death I could be (both myself and my babies). I un-traditionally had five children as a self-employed woman with no paid maternity leave. All the while I say \"thank you\" to the universe and all that is for providing, even when the outcome falls short of my hopes. I say thank you for the flow of life itself for continuing to provide each day on some level. I married a man from Africa who was not yet proficient in English, but the language of love proved to be real, as our marriage is still healthy and alive today, 20 years later. A mixed-race marriage in the 90's was still very controversial in so many ways. This is just a beginning \"short story\" of the times I truly lived my life as I felt fit, which most times is uncomfortably perfect. If I have to choose one outrageous and inspiring story to tell of a time I went outside of my comfort zone, then I'd like to tell you the story of how I became a healing somatic practitioner/sacred living coach and retreat leader! I was, like everyone in my generation, placed in a suggested pool of interest at high school for which career I would thrive in based on a short quiz. The quiz suggested physical therapy as a good match. Okay, sounds fine, I didn't know what that was really, but I went for it! I enrolled in Eastern Michigan university in 1996 to begin my four-year physical therapy program. One day while I was walking on campus in the last weeks of my first year of school, I had a deep feeling wash over me. \"What was I doing? It's like we are all cattle feeding from the same trough. I don't want to know what everyone else wants to know. I am outta here.\" Boy, my parents were devastated that I quit college and even more freaked out when I told them I was moving to Hawaii to \"just figure it out.\" I had gotten a photocopied paper from my grateful dead, rainbow-gathering, traveling big sister, that showed two farms in the middle of the jungle. Her hand-written note gave the names of the farms that had a work trade program and I thought, \"Okay, why not?\" The pushback from my parents was expected but, everyone\u2014even my young friends\u2014had severe warnings for me. I was not to move outside of the matrix and they were \"helping to keep me safe\" by telling me horror COMFORT ZONEOut of My stories about how something could go wrong. I just knew in my heart it was the move to make and realized there was something very wrong with nobody agreeing to an adventure because of fear! I packed a hiking backpack, took my new hand drum, and off I went into the jungle with my close friend Shawn. We had no money and no plans except for the handwritten work trade addresses. It was the best decision I ever made. We landed on the big island in the middle of nowhere (it seemed). We had no car and there were no taxis to be found. There was hardly a person in the airport and Julie Kouyate is a BodyMind coach and a licensed massage therapist. She lives in Ann Arbor with her husband, Mady Kouyate Griot, daughter Koro (19), and four sons, Djimo (17), Amadou (14), Mahamadou (12), and Soriba (9). Y ou can learn more about her offerings, including bodymind coaching, somatic healing sessions, \"playshops,\" retreats, and dance classes with live drumming, at kouyatehealingarts.com, or call (734) 330-7903.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal asked a number of leaders in southeastern Michigan's conscious living community to reflect upon times in their lives that they've left their comfot zones to venture out in new ways. In the distant past or much more recently, we asked, what did you do, what inspired you, did it change you, inside or outside, big or little? Did you attend a new class, take an adventurous trip, go skydiving, stretch beyond a long entrenched boundary, start a new relationsip or end an old one, take a leap, retire, join the Peace Corps, go on a night trek in the wilderness, or just do something way out of the ordinary? Upon reflecting on \"a single time\" that I have moved outside of my zone of comfort, I am somewhat stumped. I realized while considering this topic that I virtually live outside of my comfort zone. I was, like everyone in my generation, placed in a suggested pool of interest at high school for which career I would thrive in based on a short quiz.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 15 it was getting dark. We didn't know what to do. A few hours later, as we sat on our luggage at the airport, a huge group of hippie folk our age, packed to the gills in their small car, asked if we saw a man and women get off the plane. We said no but asked about how to get to the farms. They said, \"Hey, our friends aren't here, so hop in and you can stay at our place. We have a room for ya!\" What?!! To boot, the farms were close to their place. We found ourselves in a nice little jungle home that they were squatting at. The nearby trees were full of food. Mangos, bananas, guava, avo, liliquoi, star fruit, and jackfruit. Wow! We had a bed and food in the middle of the jungle. Just. Like. That. Turns out the farms didn't have any openings, and we couldn't stay at that house so, we lived on the beaches for over six months. There were makeshift shelters for storms that others had built over time, and we utilized these at so many secret beaches away from the tourists. Jackfruit is a great source of protein, and you can throw it on an open fire and eat it warmed. We had plentiful cocos that were young with lots of water in them, and of course we hitchhiked to the local co-op where we could fill up water jugs. One day as I was coming back in from swimming in circles with 15 other folks to call the dolphins to us (yes, we joined hands and swam in circles, which is known to attract the dolphins) I had a woman approach me. She said she needed to practice her massage techniques and her friend never showed, could she practice on me? Uh... yes, please. It was pure bliss, and I asked where she was studying. She told me she studied at the massage school in Hilo, clear across the other side of the island. I asked if I could go with her, and of course she said yes. We hitched on motorcycles the next day to the school. I literally walked into what felt like home. The music, smells, and energy was it! I came home to Michigan and within three weeks I was enrolled into Irene's Myomassology Institute in Southfield and became a massage therapist about a year later. I wouldn't change this experience for the world. I am forever grateful for my urge to see something different and the courage to be open to the unknown. Each of my experiences in life that took me into the unknown have been chances for me to rely on my creator and my trust to move more frutifully into the true expression of my life's potential. To be uncomfortable is a gift to move into what was once thought to be impossible, and to provide evidence for the trust of the ever-giving universe that continues to move us into our future. From there, my continued effort to move out of my comfort zone has taken my career into so many new paths of healing. If I was concerned about staying comfortable, I would not be able to share these offerings with my community. The unknown is a playground where we get to imagine what we desire, feel the true possibility of doing anything that we have the courage to open up to, and most importantly to play. Each of my experiences in life that took me into the unknown have been chances for me to rely on my creator and move more fruitfully into the true expression of my life's potential. To be uncomfortable is a gift to move into what was once thought to be impossible.

Namaste Katie,There is a co-worker that has remained remote this entire time, which I realize is a choice, and an opportunity. I am really struggling with this, as it feels like I am stuck with resentment and anger every time we are in a Zoom meeting. Are there any strategies to let go of this emotional weight? Eric, Ann ArborNamaste Eric, This is a tough emotional space to be in, and I am sorry that you are there. Globally, there is much unrest around issues of equity and inclusion, while at the same time a feeling of isolation and separation. Contained within the Eight Limbs of Yoga are the Yamas and the Niyamas, often described as the moral tenets of the practice. These guideposts set us up for living yoga through these difficult times, whether an instance is momentary in nature or our lifetime. One of the Yama is Aparigraha, which is translated as non-grasping or non-attachment. I often visualize this Yama as a tightly clenched fist, and with a tightly clenched fist, it is hard to receive, challenging to accept. All of us hold on, and often hold on tightly, to thoughts, feelings, and situations that are not ours to hold. When we are looking at Aparigraha we are asking ourselves through these situations, how does this serve me? What purpose does this holding have on my growth? On my emotional well-being? These are often uncomfortable explorations. Meditation can be a safe place to get next to and sit with discomfort. In explorations of Aparigraha, rarely do we release all at once, like in a game of tug-of-war. Rather, there is a slow softening and opening that comes with building our own awareness. With all the external stressors occurring, practicing self-compassion and softening (wherever we can) has the potential to bring relief to our mental and emotional spaces. Namaste, Katie... Whether you're a seasoned yogi or getting ready to roll out your mat for the first time, here you'll find a variety of useful tips from local yoga instructor, Katie Hoener. YOGA COLUMN Namaste Katie, I love breathing techniques. They are a tool that I can take anywhere, and I have been using them more and more. I am hoping to find a breath practice that is efficient and grounding. In my high-pressure job, I need something I can incorporate quickly (I know, not the most mindful attitude). Annie, Scio TownshipDear Annie,We are all working in the spaces we have available right now, and if you have a minute, that is a wonderful space to build a practice! Recently I have been playing with kumbhaka, breath retention, as an amazing way to come back into the body. This practice develops focus and mindfulness in an efficient and purposeful way and grounds us through the breath. One beautiful kumbhaka practice is to take a nice full inhale, knowing that fullness will depend on the moment. Take a pause at the top of the inhale. Purse the lips and start to exhale slowly and forcefully, as though you were blowing out the candles on a birthday cake. Try as you are completing this exhale to not inflate the cheeks. About a third of the way into the exhale, take another brief pause for a moment or two. Exhale again through pursed lips, pause and hold, then complete the exhale. If you are comfortable with a brief retention at the bottom of the exhale, take a brief pause prior to inhaling. Take two full breaths in a soft and comfortable way, and then try this kumbhaka practice one more time. When you have finished your two rounds of kumbhaka, take a moment to notice how the body feels, how the mind feels, and the sensations surrounding the breath spaces. Each time you practice Exhale forcefully.Namaste Katie, I have spent way too much time on my couch watching TV, working, things that have made my posture less than ideal. I am hoping to spend a little time each day on something to open the front side of my body, as I feel like I am getting contracted. Sumner, YpsilantiDear Sumner,That feeling is quite relatable! I too, have spent more time collapsing on the couch than I would like to admit, and it feels like a collapse\u2014no orientation of my body into any sort of alignment. There are certainly ways to be more mindful in our rest, which I think most of us logically know, and is harder to put into practice. There are also ways to counteract these impacts through our yoga practice. One such posture is a Sphinx Pose. Sphinx Pose is a posture that we come into from our abdomen. It can be nice, though not necessary, to come in from a Crocodile Pose, where we lay down, crossing the arms, stacking the forearms on top of one another, and resting the forehead on the arms. This allows the back to start to lengthen in a neutral way. When we've been slouched for a long period of time, this neutrality can be a helpful way to start, and can prevent the muscles in the spine from reacting to the backbend/heart opener we are about to practice. From this space, walk the palms out in front of the body and engage the muscles of the back in order to lift the heart off the floor/mat. Simultaneously, press into the palms, and maybe the forearms. As everyone's arms are proportioned different, this may feel slightly different as to where the contact feels most grounding. You'd like to feel the shoulder blades moving toward one another and down the back to a degree that feels comfortable. When you first start a Sphinx Pose it can be intense, so find a place where you can sit with that intensity. Adjust the distance of the arms from the body as needed to adjust the amount of backbend you are engaging in. The gaze lands where it feels right, perhaps starting toward the floor, then directly in front, and maybe even slightly upturned. See how long you can hold without the back cramping or feeling over exerted. Come back to Crocodile, or another rest space. Repeat as it feels good. Katie Hoener is a RYT 500, receiving her 200 and 500 hour trainings. She is also a Licensed Master Social Worker and a partner at Verapose Yoga in Dexter (veraposeyoga.com).

Owners Cynthia Gabriel and Toni Auker both teach childbirth education and are experienced doulas. Nest & Nurture, a childbirth and parenting center, opened in Ann Arbor in May of 2022. See Listing on page #26 Photos by Joni StrickfadenThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 23 Ann Arbor and Detroit-based somatic movement therapist and educator Stefanie Cohen, MA, RSMT, will be offering somatic support groups for therapists and healers starting in September. The weekly in-person sessions will offer an opportunity for therapists and healing professionals to join with peers \"to discover practices of somatic movement as a means of healing, self-discovery, creative expression, and self-care.\" Cohen first offered this group experience in the spring as an eight-week session, but the fall sessions will meet for 12 weeks. There will be a group meeting on Monday evenings, and another on Saturday in the early afternoon-dates will be announced on her website as they are finalized. She said that the initial groups made good connections with one another and \"appreciated the opportunity to connect with and tend to their own bodies.\" Cohen said many in caring professions focus so much on others that they can become disconnected from themselves. \"The group sessions will allow us to both offer compassionate witness to others and to be seen and held, ourselves. To release what doesn't belong to us and to nourish and replenish our body and minds. To come together to tend ourselves in good company.\" The groups will be kept to around eight people. Cohen also works with people privately. She has been a somatic educator for 25 years and draws on multiple practices \"oriented toward contemplative movement, experiential anatomy, and somatic trauma therapies.\" She is passionate about the ideas of embodiment, contemplative practice, spiritual mystery, and creativity. With the support groups, as well as with her private sessions, she helps care providers explore somatic practices to \"consider how best we can listen and be in service to our own bodies, our patients and/or clients, and how to access the resources we need to do so.\" Stefanie Cohen can be reached by email at stefaniemovingstories@gmail.com and her website is somastories.com. Ann Arbor-based teacher Merilynne Rush will offer End-of-Life Doula training and Advance Care Planning Facilitator training this fall. Rush has been a pioneer in the end-of-life doula field and in the past year has built a team at her practice, The Dying Year. They offer training, counseling, and consulting related to death, home funeral and green burial, and end-of-life care. Christina Wall, who joined The Dying Year as an administrative assistant and teacher, said that this allows her the ability to provide more doula services, mentoring of other doulas, trainings, and more. There are now six people on staff at The Dying Year in addition to Rush. Rush is helping to spread awareness of end-of-life doulas as a profession and as a resource for families preparing for or dealing with the death of a loved one. Time Magazine and WebMD both published articles about end-of-life doulas this year, both quoting Rush. End-of-Life Doula training is for those looking to change their career, those already working in a related field who want to expand their skillset in assisting dying people and their loved ones, and those who simply want more knowledge to deal with deaths in their own lives and circles. Two trainings will be offered this fall: the first will be from September 9 to October 7, on Fridays at 12:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. The second will be from October 29 through December 3, on Saturdays at 1:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Scholarships and payment plans are available for those who are interested. An Advance Care Planning Facilitator class will be offered on November 14 from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. This class will prepare participants to assist healthy adults in choosing a healthcare advocate, examining their values and wishes, and documenting and sharing their preferences. The training is valuable for end-of-life doulas, medical providers, chaplains, social workers, hospice administrators, and really, everyone. This class is based in the Respecting Choices\u00ae model, which is internationally recognized and has been developed over 25 years. Both classes will be provided live online via Zoom and will include additional materials. The End-of-Life Doula training will prepare participants for certification through the National End-of-life Doula Alliance (NEDA). All trainings offered through The Dying Year \"pay special attention to addressing systemic racism and health disparities endemic in our culture\" (from the website). Said Wall, \"It's one of the many things that sets [Rush's] training apart.\" More information and registration for trainings is available on The Dying Year's website, thedyingyear.org. Merilynne Rush can be reached via email at thedyingyear@gmail.com or by phone at 734-395-9660.

She started the Circle shortly before the pandemic and kept it going via Zoom and outdoors in the Mill Pond Park in Saline while the church was closed to the public. She felt it was more important than ever to offer this type of support for people. As few as one person and as many as 10 have attended, she said. \"Anyone can participate as long as they are interested. It will change your life for the better,\" she added. The group is beginner-friendly; Kauer joked that it is \"kind of meditation and Reiki for dummies.\" After a long career of nursing and massage therapy, she is now retired and helps care for her two grandsons. She said she wishes she knew about energy healing modalities when she was raising her own children, as she finds it very helpful with the three- and seven-year-old boys. Anyone interested in joining can simply show up or can email Kauer with any questions. The only cost is a suggested love offering to the church. \"Don't be afraid if you're not a reiki practitioner, never meditated before, or have trouble meditating,\" said Kauer. Unity A2 Church is located at 4599 Carpenter Road, Ypsilanti, MI 48197. Joy Kauer can be reached by email at sacredcircleua2@unitya2.org, and Sacred Circle has a Facebook page at facebook.com/profile.php?id=100049295094522. Ann Arbor's Interfaith Center for Spiritual Growth has, like most organizations, gone through challenges and changes during the pandemic and had to learn to connect with people in new ways. The Center has risen to the challenge and is recovering. \"It's wonderful to see more life coming in person,\" said Associate Minister and Administrator Delyth Balmer. The Center's Sunday \"church alternative\" services are offered in a hybrid format now, with about 30 people generally attending in-person and about 25 via Zoom. Masks are suggested at the Center. Services draw from diverse spiritual traditions and practices, and include prayer, singing, guided meditation, spiritual readings, guest musicians, lessons by the Center's ministers, and an open mic time during which anyone can share questions, insights, or struggles in response to the day's lesson. Balmer said that the service format has evolved as the pandemic has progressed, going to Zoom-only in March 2020, then a small group of people meeting at the church to broadcast & record via Zoom, then a hybrid requiring people wishing to come in-person to sign up, and now an open in-person and Zoom format where people can attend remotely or physically according to their comfort level. What's New in the Community Continued from page 23 New Books by Area Authors Continued on page 26Ann Arbor resident Pauline Loewenhardt published her third book, a memoir titled Almost Lost: Detroit Kids Discover Holocaust Secrets and Family Survivors, in 2020 with Fifth Avenue Press. In it, she tells the story of finding her father's lost relatives in the Netherlands in 1996. Her parents came to the United States in the 1920s from Germany, and so she missed having an extended family growing up. Her parents met in the United States (though both had come from Germany), and eventually had four children. Her father would only say that he had come from a large family and spent part of his childhood in an orphanage, and he hid his Jewish heritage from his family. He was the youngest of 12 children, was drafted along with his eight brothers, and served in the German army during World War I. He was the only male of his family to come to the United States after that war following a sister who had come in 1910. Loewenhardt is not certain how much her father knew about what had happened to his siblings and other family members in the years leading up to World War II, but she believes he had some connections in Germany and later the Netherlands where his family lived, if only through his sister. Loewenhardt was raised with her three siblings in Detroit. In the mid-90s they sought out their European relatives and learned that many of them had died in the holocaust, but they found two living descendants, grandchildren of one of their father's brothers. In the 20 years since finding them, Loewenhardt has visited them in the Netherlands and hosted them in the United States, forming a \"close and loving relationship.\" She was thrilled to finally have extended family members, though that joy was dampened by learning of her father's family's plight. The Covid-19 pandemic prevented Loewenhardt from doing readings from the book as she had wanted to, but now that it has reached what she called a \"tenuous plateau,\" she is working to schedule events at the Ann Arbor District Library, at local bookstore Booksweet, and possibly at the Turner Geriatric Center. Dates will be listed on her website as they are finalized. Almost Lost can be purchased through Loewenhardt's website, and there are copies available at all of the Ann Arbor District Library's branches. Pauline Loewenhardt can be reached via email at paulineloewenhardt@gmail.com. Her website is paulineloewenhardt.com. Caf\u00e9 704 Coffeehouse Concerts have resumed, with limited in-person seating and Zoom broadcasting, said Balmer. These are musical performances that fall under the Center's commitment to host \"social events to create and inspire a vibrant and diverse spiritual community.\" Upcoming performances include folk band Path on September 10 th, folk singer Katie Geddes on October 8th, and jazz group Jean Wilson & Friends on November 12th. Balmer said the Center's Youth Education Program is ready to go, but almost no families have brought their children back to Sunday services yet. There has not been much interest in Zoom programming for children, she said, because the kids have felt \"Zoomed out.\" The program's teachers and assistant are attending services and are ready to resume teaching and caring for all ages from infants to teens during services whenever the need and desire arises. Prior to the pandemic, there used to be around six to 12 children of various ages at any given service, and the teachers and ministers look forward to being able to serve the children and families again. On November 19th, Ecuadoran shaman and sound healer Oscar Santillan will visit the Center, offering a sound healing ceremony with flute, drums, and other instruments. He will offer the Sunday Service lesson on November 20 th and will be available for one-on-one healing during the weekend. More information will be available online as the date approaches. The Interfaith Center for Spiritual Growth is located at 704 Airport Boulevard, Ann Arbor, MI 48108. Their website is interfaithspirit.org.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 26 What's New in the Community Continued from page 25 New Classes Reflective Meditation teacher and consultant Erica Dutton will offer a new class called Patience and Compassion starting October 2. The class will explore how to cultivate and maintain patience and compassion in a world and time that is overwhelmed with anger, rage, and hatred constantly compounded and reinforced by the 24-hour news cycle. Dutton will teach Reflective Meditation as part of the class, which she described as \"an open, gentle, receptive practice.\" She has been meditating for 30 years, and taught Vipassana Meditation for 12 years before shifting into Reflective Meditation about nine years ago, after encountering the work of Jason Siff, author of Unlearning Meditation and Thoughts Are Not the Enemy. Dutton said the concept of allowing and working with thoughts and emotions during meditation instead of attempting to eradicate them resonated strongly with her. This helped her \"undercut all of the pushing, striving, self-judgement,\" she said, and accept and work with whatever thoughts arose during meditation. This class will explore individuals' own definitions of patience and compassion and examine the benefits and drawbacks of practicing them: how they can help us and also hurt us. In her recent class on worrying, students explored both the positive and negative effects of worrying, which allowed a clearer view of why worrying is difficult to let go of. Similarly, concepts that seem on the surface strictly positive, can have negative aspects, and Dutton explained that it is helpful to understand both sides of this balance. The five-week class will offer teachings, meditation sittings, and opportunities to share and discuss what participants have learned. This will be done online via Zoom, on Sundays at 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. from October 2 through October 30. Beginners and experienced meditators are welcome, and anyone from late adolescence and older can participate. Dutton follows the principle of \"dna,\" which means that teachings are offered freely but donations are gladly accepted, creating a mutually reciprocal practice of generosity. Erica Dutton can be reached via email at eld306@yahoo.com,and more information is available at her website ericadutton.com. Continued on page 28 Upcoming Events The Kerrytown Book Fest will return to Ypsilanti on September 18 in a new location: Morris Lawrence building on Washtenaw Community College's campus. This all-day event celebrates books, authors, writing, and the art and craft of bookmaking. The 2022 Book Fest is the 18th, said current chairperson Mary McDonald. The last one was held in 2018. 2019 was a planned year off due to board turnover, and 2020 and 2021 were cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This year's event, due to being held at the large venue, will have several simultaneous activities and guests will be able to choose which to attend. Wade Rouse ( who also writes as Victoria Shipman) will discuss his new book Magic Season with Craig Calcaterra, author of the daily baseball newsletter \"Cup of Coffee.\" Rouse's book is a memoir about reconciling with his father through a shared love of baseball, while Calcaterra recently published his own book Rethinking Fandom: How to Beat the Sports-Industrial Complex at Its Own Game. Lev Raphael will talk about his latest mystery novel Assault with a Deadly Lie which is set at Michigan State University where Raphael received his PhD. Some of the 16 authors of The Ones Who Remember\u2014Second Generation Voices of the Holocaust will discuss the book and their experiences of growing up in the shadow of their parents' unimaginable experiences during the Holocaust. The book jacket states, \"This book offers a vision of a shared humanity against the background of inherited trauma.\" Poets Peter Markus, Christina Kallery, and Jess Kass will read from their works. Markus' latest book of poems (published by Wayne State University Press) is When Our Fathers Return to Us as Birds . Kallery currently lives in Ann Arbor and her work has appeared in numerous publications and anthologies. She has served as submissions editor for Absinthe: A Journal of World Literature in Translation and poetry editor for Failbetter . Kass founded the Literary Arts Program at Ann Arbor's teen center, The Neutral Zone, and has published several books including his poetry collection My Beautiful Hook-Nosed Beauty Queen Strut Wave. The Ann Arbor District Library's 5th Avenue Press will present a panel on Becoming an Author. McDonald said that the publishing program is unique and does great work for independent writers who live in Ann Arbor. The University of Michigan Library's Book Arts Studio will sponsor a hands-on maker craft for people interested in learning how books are made. Ann Arbor-based author and illustrator Randy Asplund will demonstrate the almost- lost art of medieval manuscript illumination, from the making of pigments from plants to the finished book. Local antique book experts will host an \"Antique Book Roadshow,\" allowing people to bring in their antique books for a better understanding, not only of their monetary value, but of their unique histories. The Emerging Writer's Group of the Ann Arbor District Library will put on a Writer's Meetup & Mini-Workshop, with mini-critiques and advice for those who bring their writing with them. Children's activities include a make-and-take project for kids in grades four and up by the Ann Arbor District Library and Story Times for young children provided by the AADL and The Michigan Chapter of the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators. A panel of children's specialists from the AADL will also share their favorite children's books. There will be a screening of The Bookstour, a short film by Mason Engel, who traveled around the country on a roadtrip visiting independent bookstores and talking to the owners and clients about the communities that form around them. The film was sponsored by the Book Industry Charitable Foundation (BINC), an Ann Arbor-based nonprofit organization that helps owners and employees in the bookselling industry. More activities include an English country dance tutorial (just like in a Jane Austin novel), a panel on writing one's personal memoirs and stories, stands from local independent bookstores including Nicola's and Booksweet, local authors selling their books, and more. Details and the schedule will be available on the Kerrytown Bookfest website ktbookfest.org as they are finalized. Any inquiries should be directed through the website portal on the contact page.

The firm deadline for submissions for the next issue (Jan. thru Apr. 2023) is November 1, 2022.New Practitioners and Businesses Nest & Nurture, a childbirth and parenting center, opened in Ann Arbor in May of 2022. Owners Cynthia Gabriel and Toni Auker both teach childbirth education and are experienced doulas. Gabriel said they saw a need in the community for a community center around childbirth and parenting after the Center for the Childbearing Year, headed up by Patty Brennan, closed in 2020. Gabriel explained that after the owner of the Center's space passed away, ownership was taken over by his daughter, who provided some much-needed renovations before she and Auker decided to use it. The space, said Gabriel, consists of a large room that can host up to about 24 people for workshops or classes, an office, and what they will use as a massage space in the future. The goal, said Gabriel, is to be a collaborative community space for families and birth workers. \"Ann Arbor has had a reputation as a great, natural-birth friendly area.... with a huge community of birth workers.\" She said the area has an abundance of doulas, home-birth midwives, support people at the two local hospitals, and one of the top Nurse-Midwifery programs in the country. Gabriel & Auker want to serve this community and help the area \"continue to carry the banner of the Southeast Michigan forward-thinking birth world.\" Currently, Nest & Nurture offers childbirth education and newborn care classes, drop-in play groups for families with small children, doula support groups and trainings, sleep workshops, Dancing for Birth classes, writing workshops, and has plans to offer prenatal yoga soon. They have an extensive collection of baby carriers for families to try out and decide what to buy (the center does not sell them; but only assists in decision-making). One of the doulas who partners with them is a lactation consultant, and the center hosts infant feeding support groups on Thursday evenings. Gabriel said they are very focused on inclusivity for \"all the different ways people make families and all the different ways of parenting.\" She mentioned she is passionate about parenting with disabilities, and the center supports adoptive families, same-sex couples, and trans parents. They will host a Dancing for Birth training workshop for birth workers, doctors, nurses, yoga and/ or fitness instructors on October 8 th and 9th; details and registration are available online. Nest & Nurture is located at 722 Brooks Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48103. Their website is www.nestandnurture.org and they can be contacted through the form on their site.

I had asked if she could share her experience as a new business owner offering holistic wellness services at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic. As I walked toward the building, I noticed rabbit footprints in the new snow, and several birds greeted me before Ryasam had a chance to open the door to introduce herself. There was no time wasted before Ryasam and I were excitedly sharing views on metaphysical spirituality and holistic wellbeing. She told her story of opening Arogyaveda in the fall of 2019, just as the virus began showing up outside of the United States. By the time it reached her own community, it was clear to Ryasam that she must continue teaching Ayurvedic science and yoga during the pandemic. I wanted to learn how Ryasam and her clientele adapted to challenges, such as teaching yoga from a distance. I also found it moving to hear how she discovered new ways that the pandemic unified her with those she counseled. After we said our goodbyes, I took my time walking to my car for the same reason the birds and rabbits frequent the grounds at Arogyaveda. I simply enjoyed how I felt in the energy there. The peaceful environment Ryasam created for herself, and her clients, helped me further understand her reasons for providing wellness knowledge at this time in particular. Now more than ever, we are seeking and applying practices that bring inner peace. Laurel Hogge: Were there any unexpected benefits to your business due to the pandemic? If so, what were they and why do you think it's unique to the pandemic? Pradeepa Ryasam: People started to realize prevention is better than cure and started to look for holistic wellness solutions to boost their immunity.

Because of this, I have seen an increase in the number of clients seeking consultation. I started consulting with my clients online. The one benefit of online consulting was that I could reach my clients anywhere on the globe from Australia to New Zealand. I also noticed people taking a huge interest in social media. So, I used Instagram and other social media to share creative content about Ayurveda and yoga. That has helped me gain new clients and students. Laurel Hogge: How have you adapted to the various mandates? Pradeepa Ryasam: For yoga, we practiced outdoors during summer with no masks. When we met indoors, we were socially distanced following CDC guidelines. During this time, online group yoga classes also worked well where clients practiced yoga from the comfort of their own homes. Laurel Hogge: What is the most useful personal skill or trait that you have implemented to keep the business going? Pradeepa Ryasam: It is important to understand that a lot of people also had emotional struggles during the pandemic, be it with the loss of loved ones, loss of a job, or even falling sick. Being empathetic to their concerns and listening to what my clients had to share was crucial. Laurel Hogge: Is there a memorable moment, good or bad, associated with having a business during such an uncertain time that you could share? Pradeepa Ryasam: Most of my offerings are on a one-on-one basis. I will work with all my clients in a very intimate setting and we both connect very well. Before I start my consultation, I chant a mantra and pray that we only exchange positive vibes and energies. In such unprecedented times, we all went through a turmoil of emotion, and it was nice to have someone to share how we felt and reciprocate the other's feelings.

I taught her some meditation and pranayama techniques and how to tune in the positive energy realm. I also reassured her and shared some of her concerns\u2014she was not alone in this journey. Working with people at this level really helped me to realize that we are all on the same path. Together we are praying and hoping together to see the end to this pandemic. Everything around us is energy, and it is in both animate and inanimate things around us. The confluence of these positive vibrations and healing is so potent,it can do miracles. Another memorable occasion was our outdoor Yoga class. Outdoor Yoga in nature just felt so refreshing. Almost all of us went into a deep state of meditation. Our yogashaala is tucked in a serene and peaceful corner of Ann Arbor surrounded by friendly wildlife and nature. If not for social distancing, we would have been indoors all the time. Laurel Hogge: Is there anything you would have changed about how you handled business during the pandemic? Pradeepa Ryasam: Offering group yoga lessons when I have people from different time zones was a challenge. I then opened one more online class that can accommodate people from different geographies. Online yoga classes, especially in a group setting, was not motivating for many as technical issues can pop up from time to time. I soon realized that I should only do private lessons, so I could focus on people individually. That worked very well, and I wish I had done that sooner rather than later. Mistakes, failures, and rejections allow us to push to the next level. Instead of dropping down with these, I try to appreciate them and quickly learn how to convert these to opportunities. The private online lessons were much more rewarding to me and my clients, so I ended all my group yoga lessons. Now that the rules have eased up a bit, I have my socially distanced group yoga lessons and they are going great once again. Laurel Hogge: Did you take any time away from operating as a business? Pradeepa Ryasam: No, we did not shut down the business. I knew at that time Ayurveda, yoga, and meditation were much needed for everyone. I thoroughly enjoy teaching yoga and Ayurveda especially because these can bring a direct impact on people's lives and lifestyles. I like to stay authentic in my practice and principles since both Ayurveda and yoga are highly spiritual practices. It was such a fulfilling experience to offer wellness during these tough times. I used to get notes from my clients saying how grateful they are, and notes like these would make me extremely humble and allow me to continue what I was doing. \"Mistakes, failures, and rejections allow us to push to the next level.

Brighton Light House (BLH) is three words. That's because, unlike a \"lighthouse,\" BLH is not a cautionary beacon on a rocky shoreline\u2014a vision that may have come to mind at first glance. Rather, the light radiating from BLH is one that beckons the community toward it with the sole purpose of providing space for individuals to find, nurture, and shine their own light. If you think that sounds incredibly idealistic for a business model, you're right again. Ultimately, it was the simple faith of husband-wife team Anna and Dan Oginsky that made it possible for this community gathering place to be built, and to surprisingly flourish, even as the global pandemic progressed. The Oginskys began planning their business in December of 2016 and opened the doors in February of 2021. While it's normal for a business of this scale to take years to be created and built, it is unusual to do such a thing during a worldwide pandemic. I visited BLH to find out some of the challenges that arose throughout the process and to learn how the couple overcame them. Anna Oginsky greeted me with a warm smile and a hug before we began our tour around the property. She showed me individual private offices, large gathering rooms, and expansive outdoor spaces while pointing out the Michigan-made details that are incorporated throughout the property. Her husband Dan, a history enthusiast, was especially involved with finding the perfect items to preserve the essence of the original 1860s Michigan home. So, how did Covid-19 affect their plans and progress? Imagine, as a first-time business owner, having your building under construction when you are told that building trades would soon be forced to cease operation for an unknown amount of time. Oginsky described it simply as \" a strange time.\" But she added, there were many gifts that appeared along with each challenge. Laurel Decker: Were there any unexpected benefits that came from opening during the pandemic? If so, what were they, and why do you think it's unique to the pandemic? Anna Oginsky: Our focus was on creating a unique space where people could come to work, learn, grow, and share their gifts. The pandemic created a situation where places people typically go to do those things were no longer available\u2014places like offices, restaurants, and classrooms.

We have a unique event space with garage doors that create an open-air vibe that people love and, as it turned out, was very covid-friendly for gathering people together. We were booked last summer and I'm not sure the word would have gotten out as quickly if the pandemic didn't create a need to find new, safe spaces to gather. Laurel Decker: How have you, your staff, and your clientele dealt with the various mandates, such as stay-at-home, social distancing, masks, no masks?Anna Oginsky: We followed all local and state mandates on when we could open to the public, masks, and social distancing, and CDC guidelines on how to handle exposure (we only had one). When masks were required, we also required them in common spaces. The nature of our business allowed us to also give people flexibility in determining their own level of comfort as well. We don't have crowds, and most people worked individually behind closed doors so they could take their masks off when alone and in rooms where there were several people, we have the capacity to spread out. We also use air purifiers, hand sanitizing stations, and deep cleaning. We were able to maintain a safe, clean, welcoming environment, I think. 734-604-6938Danielle Groth ENERGY HEALER REIKI CLINICAL EFT (TAPPING) VIBRATIONAL SOUND MEDITATION WONDER-TWINNING MENDINGENERGY MEDICINEMODALITIES: RETREATS ANDWORKSHOPS GUIDED MEDITATIONAND SOUND BATHSOTHER SERVICES: Angel Whispers Spiritual Spa & Boutique 7940 Ann Arbor St., Dexter, MI 48130Angel Whispers Spiritual Spa & Boutique www.angelwhispersspiritualspa.comMASSAGE CHAIR MIGUN MASSAGE TABLE SOUND & FREQUENCY HEALING TABLESPA ROOM: Our Offerings & Who We Are ARTISTIC CREATIONSFROM LOCAL ARTISTS DRUMS, SINGINGBOWLS AND TUNINGFORKS BOOKSBOUTIQUE ROOM: JEWELRY CRYSTALS AND STONES LOCAL ORGANICAPOTHECARY HOME GOODS ANDMORE!

Anna Oginsky: Staying open to what's possible and curious about what would best serve our members and guests. We are constantly looking for new ways to provide a high-quality experience and we're not afraid to pivot when what we're doing isn't working. Laurel Decker: Is there a memorable moment, good or bad, associated with having a business during such an uncertain time that you could share?Anna Oginsky: I'm struggling to find the right words to describe how it felt to be able to provide a safe space for people to gather after they had been unable to do so for so long. To witness the smiles, the hugs, the laughter, tears, and the palpable relief everyone shared in being in the same space again with loved ones was a gift and something I will never forget. Laurel Decker: Is there anything you would have changed about how you handled business during the pandemic? Anna Oginsky: When there were clear mandates, I felt confident in how we handled our business during the pandemic. It was much more difficult when there were no clear guidelines about what to do. We were constantly wondering if we were doing everything right to keep ourselves, our staff, our families, our members, and guests safe. I think we handled it well from where I sit now, but in the moment, I just never wanted to make the call that would cause someone to become ill. If anything, I guess I would have trusted myself more and not spent so much time worrying about the what-ifs. Laurel Decker: What keeps you motivated to persist through the challenges of business ownership?Anna Oginsky: In my heart of hearts, I know this business is about something bigger than day to day operations. It's a calling and having faith in that is what keeps me motivated. Owning a business is harder than I ever imagined it would be, but I guess it's a lot like parenting in that way. This path means I get to live the fullest possible life. It's a privilege I try not to take for granted. Before we wrapped up our tour and interview, Oginsky shared a little more about her business name's play on words. She explained that as the building neared completion, she was still having a hard time committing to a final name.

We stood looking at the physical manifestation of what started as an idea, and Oginsky added, \"We all have a light.

Something new means there is something old. The Earth is full of those old things; so full that we, as humans, are seeing the damage daily. One can almost never escape a day fully unscathed from the problem that is container waste. While we cannot eliminate the latter overnight, we can control how we approach the problem today. At BYOC Co. in Ann Arbor, owner Emma Hess strives to offer solutions. BYOC Co., short for Bring Your Own Container Company, was one of the small businesses that blossomed from the harrowing seed of the pandemic. What began as a pop-up shopping experience in August of 2020 turned into a brick-and-mortar store in downtown in April of 2021. Bring a refillable container downstairs in Liberty Square and discover a resourceful and reusable call to action in the face of waste. Pastel shampoo and conditioner bars stacked like macaroons are lined on a table. Body bars and cut-your-own-soaps fill the space with lavender, eucalyptus, mint, and other inviting aromas. Laundry detergent is scoop your own, pay by the ounce. There are eco-friendly pet toys and reusable oral care solutions. What BYOC Co. has built is a communal everyday living resource unique to Ann Arbor, in which the customer can contribute as well as benefit. It is a symbiotic relationship that has only flourished during the consistent threat of pandemic, generating repeat customers and regulars who Hess knows by name. How does one begin to shop in a store like BYOC Co.? \"At BYOC Co., we're aiming to reduce single use plastic consumption by allowing folks to refill containers that they already own, with ethically sourced and eco-friendly, plastic-free household cleaning and personal care products,\" said Hess. \"We're not trying to eradicate single use plastic. There are means for it, and you have to kind of think holistically when you think about zero-waste or low-waste.\" \"Containers that they already owned\" can mean an empty yogurt quart, an old kombucha bottle, or a worn-out beer growler. Hess has not seen a container she cannot refill, so long as it's \"clean and dry.\" Customers can also purchase a container in the store for $2.50 to $10, depending on size. Sometimes, smaller containers are available for free. \"I always say sustainable living has three big barriers to entry, and that's time, energy, and money,\" said Hess. \"They all kind of play their own role, but I think a lot of it is really getting yourself out of that convenience-culture mindset; not relying on Amazon for everything, and not just opening a trash bin and throwing anything in there without a thought to it.\" At just 22 years old, and two months shy of graduating with a sociology degree from the University of Michigan, Hess said BYOC Co. \"just sort of happened\" after Covid uprooted her from her college living situation and transplanted her into her brother's Royal Oak home. \"Once I moved in with my brother, I began taking the term \"low-waste lifestyle\" more seriously in my personal life. I didn't really have the restriction of a bunch of roommates, and my brother just said, 'Go for it. Do whatever you want to do at my house.' It gave me so much freedom to really experiment with that lifestyle and take it more seriously.\" While Hess notes that the term \"zero-waste\" is more commonly known and used in regard to utilizing reusable goods, she prefers the term \"low-waste lifestyle\" because it's more realistic to her personal journey.Bring Your Own Container, Leave with a New Way to Live Green Living \"At BYOC Co., we're aiming to reduce single use plastic consumption by allowing folks to refill containers that they already own, with ethically sourced and eco-friendly, plastic-free household cleaning and personal care products.\" \u2014 E mma Hess Something new means there is something old. The Earth is full of those old things; so full that we, as humans, are seeing the damage daily.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 35 \"I think when it comes to your own personal journey, we're all starting at different points, especially if you're living with other people. Even living with my partner there are certain things where he draws the line and says, 'I'm not personally going to do that,' so there are just things that I'll go and do on my own or we have to kind of meet in the middle. \"But to me, I think what constitutes a low-waste lifestyle is making the effort\u2014 picking and choosing what's going to be maintainable for your life. At the end of the day, if you go all in and it's just too much for your life and your priorities, then maybe that's not the most sustainable option for you, but it could be for someone else. It's definitely a balance. I like to meet people where they're at, and not make them feel like they're never doing good enough. We just need everyone making an effort.\" BYOC Co. aims to make that effort feel a little less daunting and a lot more accessible, while acknowledging that sustainable living can come with a literal price tag. \"There are products that come at a higher price point. If you're able to make those swaps and keep up with it and have the privilege to do so, I think it's a great thing to get on board with. If you're already shopping at the farmers market and you swing on by to us, even for a couple of items, I consider that a win. We really try to source as locally as possible, especially when we're looking at price points.\" \"There's a lot of things that go into the choices we make and what products we sell. And not everyone has access to those things, and not everyone can afford to go to the farmers market every week, for instance, so we approach our products the same way; if you have the ability to do so, we totally encourage you to come in and embrace this concept. If you don't have the means, or you can't get everything from us, even picking and choosing those few items that you can afford with us every month makes a big difference.\" Hess said that a good way to begin low-waste living is to start with swapping out traditional shampoo bottles with BYOC Co.'s shampoo bars, which eliminate the use for plastic containers and offer an average of 55 washes. Bring a refillable container downstairs in Liberty Square and discover a resourceful and reusable call to action in the face of waste.\"I had been doing little things here and there at the start of my journey, with shampoo bars and reusable makeup rounds, just to begin that swap from throw-aways to low-waste in a way that felt obtainable. But with a full rein on my brother's house, we were able to set up a composting system, and we started to garden. We ended up finishing our last roll of paper towels and switched all over to rags, and it was just kind of a step-by-step process. We used something up and we made the swap to something sustainable instead. And now I'm almost three years out, and there are still sustainability goals I'm striving for every day. But every bit counts.\" Hess said taking a step back and looking around all these big box stores was a wake-up call, too. \"We had all these bulk food stores available and that was really great, but I kept thinking... okay, but what about everything else that I don't have access to refill? Some bulk food stores have a shampoo refill, or they might have some castile soap, but they don't have everything. That really got me thinking. How could we solve this problem?\" Beyond offering refillable products, BYOC Co. also offers recycling on everyday items such as cosmetic containers, crayons, razors, oral care waste, and more. In one word, Hess describes BYOC Co. as \"innovative.\" \"Just looking at how consumers purchase goods now, I hope BYOC Co. can show the world a better direction to head into,\" said Hess. In the future, Hess said she hopes to incorporate other local businesses with the same sustainability goals as BYOC Co. 's into a partnership, in whatever form that may take. As an avid coffee drinker, she brings up sustainable and/or reusable local coffee options as an interesting venture but is open to all possibilities the future may offer her. Said Hess, \"In 100 years, I hope this is how we are all purchasing goods. We're always bringing our containers to the stores and refilling them, over and over. I hope that's what the future looks like.\" Visit BYOC Co. At 255 East Liberty Street # 215, in Ann Arbor, open Wednesday through Sunday. Check out BYOC Co.'s website at byocco.com for store hours.

You are likely to find beautiful stones that you did not even know existed on the plentiful shelves and tables. There is always something new to discover on a trip to World of Rocks, such as the innocuous-looking coprolite, also known as the fossilized feces from creatures that lived millions of years ago, or a shiny rainbow lattice sunstone, a distinctive and rare type of orthoclase feldspar that is unique to one small, specific area in northern Australia. The walls and tables are filled with all different kinds of captivating rocks and fossils, both polished and raw. In the back of the store is a microscope that you can use to check out the stones up close and personal. Children's faces light up when they receive a free stone on every visit. Who would have thought a store about rocks would be so educational and entertaining?World of Rocks is the perfect stop for people who love stones and crystals as well as those who create their own jewelry using stones, such as in wire wrapping. If jewelry is your thing, but you do not make it yourself, you can't miss the pieces made by local artists. You can even have a custom item made using your own stones or something you have purchased in the store. It is a beautiful way to wear your favorite crystal. If you have a rough stone you would like to have polished, World of Rocks can help you with that, too. And if you have your own rock that you need identified or would like appraised, bring that in as well. Large crystals and geodes make excellent conversation pieces when decorating one's home or office, and World of Rocks has just such treasures in spades.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 39 Around the corner from Ypsilanti's Diagon Alley and down only a couple of blocks, located right on Michigan Avenue, is the newly opened Conjure Goddess Botanica and Metaphysical Shop. The Conjure Goddess has an emphasis on \"Conjure, Hoodoo, Voodoo, African Traditional Religions (ATRs), Santeria, Wicca, and Witchcraft\" traditions. ATRs and African-based traditions are often underserved in the dominantly white neo-pagan community, making the Conjure Goddess a beautiful addition to Ypsilanti, a city where more than a third of residents are not white. Though, of course, all are welcome. When you open the door, the warm aromas embrace you and invite you inside. There is an uncountable mixture of herbs, spices, oils, teas, and candles to tantalize the nose. And you are guaranteed a warm greeting, too. Everyone on staff is friendly and happy to see you as well as answer any questions you might have. While headquartered in Ypsilanti, the Conjure Goddess \"also cater[s] to all of Washtenaw County and any and all neighboring cities and states.\" If you cannot make it to the brick and mortar store, there is also an extensive online shop that also includes handy instructions on using candles for magic and conjure oil. Owner Tanet Jordan-Casey explained, \"We sell an array of candles, from your 7-Day Candles, Chime Candles, Intentional Candles, and more. We also sell many other tools along the metaphysical side, such as incense, sage bundles, herbs, spiritual waters and colognes, spiritual floor washes, intentional colognes, intentional oils, Conjure Goddess Botanica and Metaphysical Shop intentional soaps, tarot and oracle decks, books, tumbled stones, raw crystals, and crystal points. There are also statues, teas, journals, feathered pens, parchment paper, and other miscellaneous items.\" The Conjure Goddess answers a plethora of magical needs from components to books to magical items and even whole rituals. If you are looking for a reading, the Conjure Goddess offers them in half hour and one hour increments. (These are bookable online at the website.) In the near future, they also hope to \"host classes, workshops, and our annual retreats.\" Jordan-Casey has \"been practicing for over 20 years.\" She said, \"I've known for a very long time (and more so since 2015) that I wanted to have my own metaphysical shop. I have had an online presence since 2017, but between doing that and working, the online thing felt more like a hobby than a business. In 2018, I had finally gotten the chance to pursue my business venture full-time.\" In the beginning, her husband worked full time while she grew the online business. But success after success brought him into the business too, and the brick and mortar store had its soft opening on October 20th, 2021. The Conjure Goddess Botanica and Metaphysical Shop is located at 226 West Michigan Avenue in Ypsilanti. For more information, head to theconjuregoddess.net or email theconjuregoddess@gmail.com. If you begin your journey at Huron Street and make your way down to and then along Michigan Avenue, perusing all of the shops in between, whether metaphysical or otherwise, could easily fill an afternoon\u2014or longer. (Don't worry. There are plenty of places to grab a snack along the way if you begin to feel peckish.) The majority of the establishments in downtown Ypsilanti are locally owned and operated, making them unique and guaranteeing you a singular, not to mention magical, experience. ### The Conjure Goddess answers a plethora of magical needs from components to books to magical items and even whole rituals.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 40 and TreeTown Muralsand TreeTown Murals Beautifying Ann Arbor &Beautifying Ann Arbor & BeyondBeyond Brush MonkeysBrush Monkeys Ann Arbor has long had a tradition of downtown businesses featuring window paintings on their store fronts during the holiday season. By Sandor Slomovits Photos By Susan Ayer and Hilary Nichols with additional photos provided by Brush Monkeys A nn Arbor has long had a tradition of downtown businesses featuring window paintings on their store fronts during the holiday season. When in 2006 local artist, John Copley noticed a break in that tradition, \"I mentioned to Jim Hart of Seyfried Jewelers, that I had enjoyed the holiday window painting that someone had been doing downtown for a while. That year it was not happening. I asked him why and he said, 'Well, he died. You want to do it?' And that is where it all began.\" Partnering with the Main Street Area Association, he decorated store windows for the 2006 holiday season. Soon, said Copley \"I was working solo seven days a week during November, mostly eight hours a day, trying to keep up with demand.\" It became clear that he needed an assistant. He asked Mary Thiefels, who he'd met through their mutual membership in Chelsea Painters, a collective of artists who organize an annual art show, share paintings, and critique each other's work. At first, \"It was just a seasonal thing,\" said Thiefels. \"It was meant to be about celebrating winter, the holiday spirit. It was never meant to feature any specific holiday, so November is when John would start. He came up with the name Novemberistas.\" Laughingly she added, \"For a number of years, we were the Novemberistas, and it was John's vision that we were like this guerilla group of painters that would jump out of a van and paint the whole downtown and then get back in....\" At some point, they were joined by Danijel Matanic, also a painter, and now Mary's husband and business partner. \"John started to take in others,\" said Thiefels, \"and the crew began to grow. He was just thrilled with how the art was changing now that there were different creative voices jumping in.\" Eventually, in 2016 Copley said to Thiefels, \"'It's all you and Danijel. You take it from here.' So, we sort of brought the company into the 21 st century. We started to actually advertise. It was then that we rebranded.\" They became the Brush Monkeys.John Copley, now in his mid-seventies, said, \"I'm a genuine townie, born and raised in Ann Arbor, and have lived almost all my life in Washtenaw County.\" He's also been an artist all his life. After attending U-M Art School he has, among other things, painted traffic signs for the City of Ann Arbor, founded Crow Quill Graphics (a graphic design studio), painted murals in U-M residence halls, and painted scenery backdrops for plays and operas. Mary Thiefels, now in her forties, was also born and raised in Ann Arbor. \"Until Danijel and I moved where we're living now, I've lived a mile from Main Street my whole life.\" She graduated with an art degree from Eastern Michigan University, \"But even before my degree was finished, I was doing murals for commission, improving my craft, and entering competitions. I started answering the call around the state of Michigan for public art, and that's when my interest in wanting to do murals for public enjoyment really kind of took off.\" She worked with teens at the Neutral Zone as a full-time visual arts manager, from 2013 to 2019 while also simultaneously running Brush Monkeys and her other business, TreeTown Murals. (TreeTown Murals creates large public murals and mosaics. You've probably seen one of their largest on the back of the Courthouse Condos, downtown near the corner of Main and Huron, pictured on the cover of this issue. See the feature about TreeTown Murals in the CW Kids in the Community Column in Issue #77 of The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal or online at https://tinyurl.com/kfsh3k7a). \"The Brush Monkeys was John's idea,\" said Matanic. \"He drew a sketch for it, and I took it and made it into the logo we use today\u2014a kind of levitating, meditating monkey with a brush for a tail.\" \"We had started to notice that our winter clients also wanted spring windows, and then they also wanted fall windows,\" said Thiefels. \"We thought that this would be more all-encompassing of our year-round services, as opposed to Novemberistas, which kind of just branded us as being winter painters. We created a flyer, a postcard and stickers, and we've been able to get the word out. We have ten artists that work with us. We have about six in our hardcore crew that work year-round with us, then seasonally we bring on about five new helpers.\" Matanic added, \"The hardcore crew, the two of us, plus John Copley, Narooz Soliman, Lavinia Hanachiuc, and Colin Wilson, are the artists that are constant and actively working\u2014doesn't matter what kind of weather or time of year.\"Danijel Matanic, also in his forties, is from Serbia and got his degree from the Academy of Arts Novi Sad there. \"I'm a painter and I've been doing art most of my life. The school was pretty competitive and back then the traditional media were taught. I did murals and paintings, and all sorts of media. After I moved here, I kind of continued doing the same thing,\" Matanic shared. When asked what made him decide to move to the US, he smiles and points to Thiefels. They've known each other for about ten years, been married for five, and run Brush Monkeys and TreeTown Murals together. \"Danijel and I met, and our combined love of art and business has blossomed into these two companies,\" added Thiefels.

Here's a partial list from A to Z: artistic, brilliant, creative, dazzling, humorous, ingenious, masterful, original, whimsical, quirky, and zany. Their works range from relatively simple projects to highly detailed and ornate ones and encompass a wide range of styles and subject matter. \"We really look at each window as if it's a composition, including the display that the store front owner is working with,\" said Thiefels. \"We compliment and try to accentuate.\" \"It depends who w e work with,\" added Matanic. \"Some people, they're really specific. They know what they want. Others are more relaxed. They're like, 'Oh, its Brush Monkeys, you guys will figure it out.' And most of the time we come up with something right there on the spot. In a group of creatives, that works, it's very nice. In our hard-core crew, everyone is creative. Everyone has their own ideas. We kind of chat or have coffee, look at the window together, and then all kinds of ideas start sparking right there between us. And then we gotta sometimes kind of pull back and control [ourselves] if we start going too wild.\" They laughed. John Copley still paints with the Brush Monkeys. \"I enjoyed doing the seasonal work, and especially when people walking by would remark how they liked seeing me painting\u2014how it made them happy that the holidays were coming and how it seemed to officially usher in the holiday season. Folks were very kind and supportive, and I truly enjoyed doing the work, even when it was bitter cold, or I was standing in an inch of slush. Thanks to Mary, I still make a cameo appearance every year, usually in partnership with my excellent nephew David Zinn. It is a young person's calling.\" \" These days we bring him to hang out with us. We don't want to put too much work on the old man,\" Matanic said jokingly. \"He works as much as he enjoys, and he likes to hang out with the crew. We love him. We love to have him around.\" \"He has an aes thetic and training different from ours, and he's really taught all of us the background of sign painting, of lettering,\" added Thiefels. \"He taught us all how to paint on glass. Even though we have experience painting, there's always a learning curve when\u2014\" \" The medium is totally different,\" Matanic finished her sentence. \"You have to think about how light reflects and what affects it. There's many things to it. Those basics we learned with John.\" Thiefels added, \"He's definitely still our teacher.\" You need a lot of adjectives to describe the Brush Monkeys' window paintings. Here's a partial list from A to Z: artistic, brilliant, creative, dazzling, humorous, Brush Monkeys continued. . . ingenious, masterful, original, whimsical, quirky, and zany. \"We have ritual parties before we start in November,\" continues Thiefels. \"B rushes up, glasses down is our kickoff party, and then brushes down, glasses up is our celebration party. The majority of our window clients are from November to mid-December. But we have about fifty businesses that are now wanting year-round services. Ann Arbor SPARK hires us every year\u2014we do about twenty store fronts that SPARK pays for\u2014to help get the word out about Tech Trek. We do all sorts of, 'coming soon,' 'opening now,' so it's become like a visual enhancement to store fronts, not just for decoration, but also for announcements.\" Thiefels continued, \"Brush Monkeys and the Neutral Zone, running the art department and working with teenagers, was an excellent pairing. I still have a lot of youth that I work with or that we have talked about bringing in as Brush Monkeys. We get a lot of inquiries from artists, 'Do you need help?' or, 'Are you looking for an apprentice?' We've been able to recruit young, emerging artists into Brush Monkeys that we've then nurtured and trained. And some of them help us on the murals as well.\" Every year we're looking for new talent, we've called it kind of a micro economy for artists. We've been able to keep artists busy with this Brush Monkey company. It's a chance for all of us to make money, but also to gift, and be of service. I feel like this line of work is in a way a service to the community.\" Neither Thiefels, nor Matanic grew up in artistic families, but both were encouraged in their chosen work. \"I'm the only painter that I'm aware of in my immediate family line, or even in my ancestral family line,\" said Thiefels. \"But the element of whatever you're doing, and supporting that, was very high and valued very much. I was never discouraged from following my passion of being an artist. Ever. It all just kind of escalated with my personal passion to be an artist. And to be of service. My family are all social workers, so maybe that's part of it, too. Somehow the social aspect and the community connection that Brush Monkeys and TreeTown Murals has is in a way similar to what the values that my family, my parents taught. \"I don't have any painters in my family,\" said Matanic. \"My mother used to paint and draw just for herself, as a side thing. But my grandparents were furriers. Everyone was always valuing craft or some kind of skill that you develop and nurture. Both my brother and I are kind of doing creative things in a different way. He's doing a lot of wood carving and is a carpenter, so both of us kind of do creative work. And as Mary said, just like in her family, it was always encouraged; whatever you commit to, kind of keep going at it, and do it as much as you can. I was always taught that we, all humans, are capable of creativity in a certain way. What's your drive? What field kind of grabs you? What are you interested to commit your time to, to get more creative and better at it over time?\" Brush Monkeys is continuing to grow and evolve as a business in a variety of ways. Among other things, they plan to open an online store for Brush Monkeys swag this year. \"Until now we've been giving it [swag] away,\" said Thiefels. \"We buy a bunch each year and we just give it away. It's fun. We get so much feedback, when people see that we're painting, we often have that whole fan thing happen. 'Whoa! Like the Brush Monkeys actually working! I've never seen you; I've only seen your art!' They go on and on. And so, we have stickers on hand that we give to our fans. But we're noticing that there's certain aspects of Brush Monkeys that can, and that just needs, to grow.

Even though Danijel and I manage the company, we really look to our crew of artists for ideas about how we can grow. One of our Brush Monkeys lives in Ferndale and is picking up a lot of work in his neighborhood in Detroit. He has a Brush Monkey kit, which has all the kind of signature supplies and the quality paint that we use, and he really has branched out on his own. What I would like to see is for more artists to learn from us, but have their own agency, to maybe develop this as a side hustle for themselves, use the Brush Monkey name and signature, stick to our core values and our high quality art. I think this is a potential tool for other artists to make a living. lot of pocket change to pay for it,\" said Thiefels. \"So, we did a lot of trade with restaurants and businesses in 2020. We just wanted to help, and this was our way. We also do a few pro bono stores. Every year we do the Delonis Center, no charge. We've talked about doing other nonprofits, no charge. It's fun for us to show up for an hour or two and do something really quick. And then the gift keeps giving for months and months.\" And, continuing to talk about the intangible rewards of doing the work that Brush Monkeys does, Thiefels concludes, \"It's absolutely a hoot to be a Brush Monkey. We work outside you know, so we buy a box of hand warmers in October. You bundle up and then you have this outfit that is just covered in paint. It becomes your uniform. [Laughter.] We are a sight to see when you find us on the street painting. We love interacting with people\u2014that's a big part of the joy of it. We engage with people that want to talk. You don't often get to see artists working, creating their craft. I know with the rise of Instagram and TikTok and all these videos, you do now see more painters, sign painters, and muralists working, but there's something so mesmerizing about being able to watch someone create a work of art in front of you. Or to walk by, and then come back an hour later and see it finished. I like that it's exposing people to a different kind of creativity watching us work, seeing it go down and what goes into it. I think that's really special.\" Learn more about Mary Thiefels and Danijel Matanic by visiting them at brushmonkeys.com or treetownmurals.com.

Why aren't there Brush Monkeys in cities across the country doing this service in their communities? The city of Midland is a really good example. The judge of their court came down to Ann Arbor, saw our work, called, and had me come up and paint her home. She then threw a party where she invited all of the decision makers of downtown Midland, and the next year, the city of Midland hired the Brush Monkeys to come up and paint their entire downtown\u2014at very little cost to the storefront owners. So, we now go to Midland with five artists. We stay for five days, and we paint almost 50 storefronts. It has become an attraction for the Bay City area, that whole tri city area. We're getting calls from towns across the state of Michigan, but it's hard for us to travel if we don't have incentive to maybe do more than one storefront. So, we're looking at developing little pockets....\" \"And training already skillful artists that will work with us maybe a season or two,\" added Matanic. \"[They can] figure out how we do our thing, and then maybe they can continue training other younger, upcoming artists. Make some money out of it for themselves and be proud of doing something for their community. Maybe we'll expand the business further. Maybe it's gonna take over the world!\" \"Well, we joke, but why not?\" added Thiefels. \"Why doesn't the hardcore crew stop (in Michigan) on December 1 st, and then go down to Miami and paint for two weeks during their holiday season? We do see the business growing. We've expanded beyond the Main Street area and even beyond Ann Arbor. Since the crew has grown, we've probably increased 25% every year. Last year we did 170 storefronts across Southeastern Michigan. It's no longer just Washtenaw County. I think we were more spread out across the state of Michigan this year than ever, and we were in Toledo this spring. So, I think it's just a matter of time before what happened in Midland happens in other cities.\" During the pandemic, Brush Monkeys offered reduced rates for some of their customers who were particularly hard hit by the lockdowns. \"They didn't have a \"I was always taught that we, all humans, are capable of creativity in a certain way.\" -Danijel Matanic The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 44 exclusivity, sexual intimacy, and lifelong companionship through both good and bad times.

What advice can you give someone in a committed relationship? Dr. Sabrina Black : For those who are in a committed relationship, my question would be how long will this commitment last? If it is until death do us part, then you should get married. If you are just having a good time and having fun\u2014that needs to have a limit. If after two or so years, you haven't figured out if he/she is right for you or not, it's time to rethink some things and get clear on what you really want in life. When people who are single date until infinity, they actually hold one another hostage from better relationships. After you've been dating for over one year, and you've had an opportunity to see your partner in various seasons of life (out with family, friends, alone time) you should be able to decide as to whether you want to be with that person for the rest of your life or not. When people are single, they are usually looking toward something. If your relationship as single individuals doesn't have a definite determination or future, then you need to ask yourself, \"How long do I want to linger here?\" There is no reason for you to date beyond two years. That is more than enough time to determine if you want someone or not. After two years, you should begin to discuss marriage and or separation. You should not still be dating this person six years later hoping that you were going to marry one day. If marriage is your end goal, then you need to find someone who has the same goal in mind. You will not find that person and that person will not find you if you continue to date that person. A single person with no plans in marriage in the end is pointless. Let's continue to make love make sense as we strive to stay committed, not only in a relationship, but to each other, in our families, and friendships. Love Wins!

By Janeen Morgan The world we live in today is filled is so many uncertainties. Social and civil unrest, uncontrolled gun violence, and the never-ending saga called the Coronavirus, are all changing the lives we knew. All these factors are changing nearly every day\u2014sometimes, by the minute. One thing we can guarantee won't change is love. No matter who your love partner is, knowing how to love and who to love is very important. More important than that is knowing how to stay committed to the one you love. Not long ago, I had a chance to gain some insight on this topic from a Detroit local\u2014 Dr. Sabrina Black, CEO of Abundant Life Counseling and Coaching, LLC. A professional counselor, minister, mother, and wife, Dr. Black has been married for over 30 years. Our world needs so much help and healing. The advice she gave me is timeless, not just in these perilous times, but forever. Love is and will always be. Staying the CourseStaying the Course Committing to Love for Life The world we live in today is filled is so many uncertainties. Social and civil unrest, uncontrolled gun violence, and the never-ending saga called the Coronavirus, are all changing the lives we knew. All these factors are changing nearly every day\u2014sometimes, by the minute. One thing we can guarantee won't change is love. Janeen Morgan: How has commitment played a role in your professional life as a counselor? Dr. Sabrina Black: Commitment is paramount. Not only as a professional counselor, but in life. Especially in relationships. Commitment is defined as being dedicated to a cause or activity that is important to you. When you are committed to something, you are willing to make sacrifices, and you are willing to stay the course to see change come about. As a professional counselor, I am committed to help my clients accomplish the goals and objectives for which they have sought help. As a counselor, I am choosing to enter into that person's world to help him/her navigate the course of their life. It could be easy to give up or give in when things get off course. But that is when we determine how committed we truly are. That is when people most need us to be committed. Just like in relationships. The commitment we make in marriage is until \"death do us part\u2014\" not until things get difficult. People seem to have lost clarity about what it means to be committed, to be faithful, to be loyal, to be steadfast. These are words that we need to define before we enter into a relationship. They [those definitions] will help us determine if we are truly ready. You may find that you know how to be committed, but only to yourself and not to another. Janeen Morgan: Do you believe a person is single until they are married?Dr. Sabrina Black: Single based on how society has defined it would mean a state of being where an individual is not in a committed relationship. Marriage is also a state of being. Many people classify their status online in various ways to indicate their availability and commitment to their current relationship. Many Christians consider themselves single yet married to Christ. Others consider themselves single yet available. Single has over time had a negative connotation. It has implied that you are alone, that no one wants you, or that you are difficult to please or be with. However, single being a solitary state, simply means that you are making a choice to not be in a relationship. When you are choosing to be single versus married, you are also indicating that you are willing to do without the privileges of marriage. Without sounding sanctimonious, some of the benefits of marriage are supposed to be \"People seem to have lost clarity about what it means to be committed, to be faithful, to be loyal, to be steadfast. These are words that we need to define before we enter into a relationship.\" -Dr. Sabrina Black Dr. Sabrina Black with her husband, Warren Jos\u00e9 Black. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 45 By Jennifer Lee Stein Photos by Linda Lawson Psychotherapy has undergone massive shifts and transformations since its inception in the early 20th century. By the 1980s, modalities such as cognitive, psychodynamic, and dialectical behavioral therapies were firmly planted as the gold-standard of the field. Meanwhile, out in the Midwest, a therapeutic model started to percolate that would, nearly 40 years later, undergo exponential growth and be considered the revolutionary paradigm shift in the world of psychotherapy. This model goes by the name of Internal Family Systems therapy (IFS) and it is popping up wherever you go. There are various reasons why IFS is exploding right now. One is that it works. The founder of IFS, Dr. Richard Schwartz, notes that he sees himself as a \"hope merchant,\" and that if you want to find relief, healing, and emotional freedom, this is a path that offers deliverance. There are two prominent aspects of IFS that are important to understand: First, the recognition of the multiplicity of the mind. People naturally speak this way, \"a part of me wants to stay, a part of me wants to go.\" If you've ever noticed your seemingly contradictory feelings, opinions, and behaviors, you're in the company of billions of people. Our minds are multiple! The other aspect that completely shifts the narrative is the concept of Self. Schwartz describes happening upon \"Self\" as he worked with clients at University of Illinois at Chicago in the 1980s. His clients were dealing with bulimia and self-harm, and they would, at times, talk about these \"parts\" inside that were often in direct conflict or allied with one another. Having been trained as a family therapist, he began to wonder if, internally, we all had a constellation of \"parts\" that, when out of balance, behaved like a dysfunctional external family. As Schwartz explains, he learned from his patients that their parts indeed formed internal networks that resembled family relationships, hence the name Internal Family Systems. Schwartz found that when clients were able to mindfully separate from, but remain in relationship with their parts, a state of being characterized by compassion, clarity, curiosity, and confidence emerged that he called Self, and that Self inherently could allow the spaciousness necessary for the healing of clients' parts to occur. As a basic roadmap of parts, there are two main camps: exiles and protectors. Exiles are parts of us that are usually very young and vulnerable, and often frozen in the past when trauma or other difficulties occurred. Because we don't know what to do with that distress, especially at a young age, our systems unconsciously banish these parts to the further reaches of our psyche so that we can operate and function without being overwhelmed by feelings of worthlessness, sadness, or shame. The guardians, or protective parts, develop to ensure that the system is not overwhelmed by the exile's emotions. There are two kinds of protective parts: managers are the parts that proactively look for ways to control external situations so that the exile does not get activated: these are usually anxious parts, obsessive parts, very organized parts that may need to clean, plan, control. Manager parts work to prevent further pain from entering the system and adding to the emotional \"load\" of the exiles that they protect. Inevitably, however, managers cannot control everything, and so the exile's deep pain gets activated, and a \"firefighter\" part may step in to put out the flames of emotion. Some firefighter activities include over drinking, sleeping or eating, binging (with food, television/video games and other substances), shopping, etc.; these parts are often seen to be impulsive but tend to do their jobs in more reactive ways. When any of our parts are unburdened from these roles, they have wonderful qualities that they aren't able to express until released from their duties. I spoke with Tanis Allen, a licensed clinical social worker and IFS therapist, about the modality. Allen was one of a handful of Michigan IFS therapists who started learning about the model in the 1990s and trained with Richard Schwartz. Jennifer Stein: How did you find IFS? Tanis Allen: I was a medical social worker at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital, and a local therapist by the name of Jane Fink, who was training directly with Dick Schwartz in Chicago at the time, had been invited by our social work department to provide a continuing education session. I became absolutely intrigued by the model after this introduction, and shortly after that, Jane also invited Dick Schwartz to come to Ann Arbor to do an introductory workshop and another in-depth workshop a year or so later. I attended those and was completely hooked after that. That was, I want to say, about 1995. At that point, nobody knew about IFS, it was in its infancy. IFS Therapy:IFS Therapy: More Than the Sum of Our Parts As a basic roadmap of parts, there are two main camps: exiles and protectors.There are various reasons why IFS is exploding right now. One is that it works. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 46 Jennifer Stein: What was it that hooked you? Tanis Allen: As many people say about this model now, it was that it just felt natural to me. It is very common for anyone to say: \"there's a part of me that feels like this and another part that feels completely differently.\" It just made a lot of sense to me. And it was totally intriguing. I held onto that. Jennifer Stein: Can you describe the process of IFS?Tanis Allen: The bottom line with IFS is that it's all about non-pathologizing whatever is presented to you as a therapist. It is about normalizing and validating all behaviors and feelings\u2014in IFS we call those parts. Whereas, in the regular medical model, or institutionalized ways of approaching behavior management or mental health care, the focus tends to be on the management of symptoms, particularly if we talk about something like an eating disorder, severe depression or anxiety, or other addictions. With an eating disorder, it's all about making sure the person eats if they are anorexic or doesn't purge if they are bulimic. So, IFS takes a completely different view of that process\u2014which is to actually invite the restrictor, in an eating disorder situation, to talk about what it feels like its job is. What it's trying to do for that person. It's a completely different perspective. Same with a binger, a purger, a depressed, anxious, obsessive, or highly critical part. All of these are considered to be parts that are doing something very important for the person. IFS is all about being open to what that's about and what might be underneath it. In the IFS community, the phrase \"all parts are welcome\" is used to illustrate the framework of the model as inviting and allowing all parts of us to speak their truth and to be our teachers in coming to understand the internal dynamics that are individual to each person and situation. JS: What happens to parts when you're open to them? TA: They're pretty surprised at first, actually, because generally they're not invited into the room. Typically, in other approaches to mental and behavioral health, it's all about managing them, and getting them to stop a target behavior if possible. So, it's pretty incredible to be with someone and say, \"let's get to know this part of you that feels that it's so important that you not eat or feels that it has to make you binge. Let's hang out with that. Let's see what we can understand from that one's point of view rather than saying, \"you can't be doing that.\" This is generally what people in that circumstance are met with in their families or out in the world. So, it's surprise and appreciation that some acknowledgement is being made that these parts are in fact trying to help...and when welcomed in this way these parts actually have incredible wisdom which they can share with us. JS: What is your experience and understanding of Self and Self-energy?TA: Usually I think about it in terms of being our \"best self,\" or the \"core\" of us that is not one of these parts that we were just talking about. The notion of Self is what really sets IFS apart from many other models that work with parts. Self is that within us that can be present to our parts in a loving, open, compassionate way\u2014that actually acts like an internal therapist and a loving, involved witness. This is the piece that really drew me to this work, because it takes the therapist out of the expert role and places the therapist very firmly in the facilitator or consultant role, which is incredibly empowering for people. Because once Self-energy can be tapped into, once that place or energy can be experienced, then deep healing can occur. It doesn't happen without that, really. JS: What has been a significant experience of Self for you?TA: There have been many of those. It feels to me that working with Self-energy is a practice of being in relationship with and present to your parts as consistently as possible. I would say for me and most other IFS therapists that I know, especially if they've been doing this for a long time, that Self is in everything that I do. It's very much about your connection spiritually as well\u2014the way I often describe Self to people, and this does tend to depend on their own spiritual approach to things, but for me it has always felt like Self is the \"divine spark\" within each of us and is that which connects us to the bigger Self-energy that's out there in whatever belief system that we might have. That has been my experience of Self...It kind of boils down to faith, and not faith in a religious sense, but faith that I know my Self is always there\u2014even if I (or my parts) can't see it or feel it in the moment\u2014I know it. And so having that kind of faith and trust in your internal workings is a really big deal. This is a way of life, and the way we find our way through, and it's just been an incredible gift to me in my life personally because of that. JS: How has IFS changed your relationships?TA: It has greatly impacted how I view and function in all of my relationships. In a relationship, what we often do, particularly when there is conflict, is to point at the other person and say (out loud or just to ourselves), \"Well, you're the problem.\" What's great about IFS is that, when you're looking at any relationship, but particularly in an intimate partnership, it's all about kind of doing this U-turn into yourself. You have to be with your own internal conflict: what's going on with Tanis Allen and her feline friend.The bottom line with IFS is that it's all about non-pathologizing whatever is presented to you as a therapist. It is about normalizing and validating all behaviors and feelings\u2014in IFS we call those parts. -Tanis AllenMore Than the Sum of Our Parts continued...

This isn't to say there aren't any fights, but it makes communication very different from what it otherwise might look like. This kind of turn-around can bring in much more compassion, true connection, curiosity, and for me, humor, which has been very healing in my own system and my relationships. It's an internal knowing that, \"okay, here's what's happening with me right now; what do I need to do to take care of my own parts and maybe communicate for them in some way? (Rather than from them, which usually never goes all that well.) JS: So, communicate for them and not from them? That seems key. TA: It's very, very important and is one of the foundational pieces of the model. JS: Because there's more Self there?TA: Yes, it's like Self is fielding the reaction first and can be the mouthpiece for our parts that need to express something important (to both ourselves and the other person). So, rather than saying something like, \"You are so messy, you're driving me crazy,\" it would be switching that around to, \"There's a part of me that gets so frustrated by the mess in the kitchen.\" It sounds like just a semantic shift, but when you're in the thick of it, it is very different. I've done a fair amount of couples' work with IFS, too. It's quite a turnaround for most people to be able to do that\u2014to really do that U-turn and look at what's going on inside of themselves first rather than what's wrong with their partner that may be causing trouble in the relationship. JS: What is the research being done on IFS right now? TA: There's a great deal of research happening since the Foundation for Self- Leadership was established for funding along with providing scholarship support. The first study that was run by a physician and a team of IFS therapists had such dramatic results that it helped IFS become recognized as an evidence-based modality. It was a study with rheumatoid arthritis patients and found that the participants who received IFS therapy actually reported a decrease in physical pain and depressive symptoms, and experienced increased physical functioning and self-compassion. They were blown away by these initial results, and it was really incredible. There have been many other research studies since then, several with adults suffering with PTSD. One of these was able to show that with IFS treatment, 92% of the participants no longer qualified for the PTSD diagnosis. There are IFS programs all over the world now which are bringing the model to students and teachers in schools, to the prison population, and to regions of major political unrest like the Middle East. The model really has taken wing, with its now thousands of dedicated IFS therapists, educators, and researchers, to become a healing force for our whole world which has always been Dick Schwartz's dream. JS: That's amazing.TA: Yes, it's incredible. You really see the power of Self energy as a healing force, and not just to address emotional issues. Isn't that something? Now the research is revealing that, when an exiled part has been unburdened, new neural pathways are being made. Things like that. The newest IFS research is proving that the brain is actually changing as a result of this work. JS: If you could describe this approach using only one or two words, what would they be? TA: Transformation and compassion...for our internal worlds, our relationships, for the groups and institutions, and even the countries in which we live, and ultimately, for our world. JS: Thank you so much for doing this interview. I've teared up a couple times.TA: Well, thank you! I am struck by the assertion by Richard Schwartz that Self is our birthright, and therefore love, compassion, and healing are as well. The therapeutic model that started with Schwartz's curiosity toward his clients has evolved into a path that intersects psychotherapy, spirituality, and neuroscience. In these times, this coalescence is the path forward, and the balm that takes us inward to none other than our Self.

Werthmann \"I don't think I've ever seen someone in chronic pain, myself, who doesn't have a history with trauma,\" Christi Bemister said as she opened up a weekend retreat on trauma and chronic pain. The retreat covered the work of healing the mind and body together through the Realization Process created by Judith Blackstone. \"They're very intricately related, because chronic pain is actually a brain issue versus simply a physiological one. It's a very complex issue,\" she added. Christi Bemister is an Ann Arbor-based psychologist and therapist also trained in holistic healing modalities, who works with people healing from trauma. She has co-hosted retreat weekends working with Judith Blackstone material on healing the mind and body with Marcia Haarer, whom I have previously interviewed for this column. Bemister's work fascinates me, because of my own history that can't seem to unhook chronic illness from trauma triggers. I have learned a lot over the years about the biological mechanisms of how trauma and chronic stress can alter your body's response to stress and trigger chronic illness in different ways. This means a lot to me because it helped me understand that there are very real physiological changes at work here and it isn't helpful to blame myself for being anxious or try to force myself to pretend to be okay when I don't have answers. Science has made great headway lately into understanding trauma and the brain, and how traumatic stress affects physical health. I believe work like Christi Bemister's will help many people. I run into people all the time who have a problem with chronic or sudden illness triggered by traumatic stress, so I wanted to learn more about what Bemister offers through these weekends to see if it might help some of the many people out there who may find relief through mind-body therapies. I hope that through learning about the Realization Process, you will find something that speaks to you as well and offers a way forward to a healthier and more pain-free life. Laura Cowan: So, Christi, tell me how you got into this work. What led you to working in mind-body healing therapies? Christi Bemister: I have my own long healing journey having been 60 percent burned when I was four years old. I was in the hospital for two months before returning home. [This] resulted in touch being very painful for me for many years. Additionally, I grew up in a home with an autistic brother who was verbally and physically abusive, yet he was the protected one. This did a number on my self-esteem and sense of identity. I often wondered what was wrong with me that I was not protected from his abuse. I was told I 'should' just be grateful that I was normal and that he can't help what he is doing. No one's fault... however to a kid, abuse is abuse, and this confused me. I learned I was not worth protecting. I learned to hate myself.Laura Cowan: How did this journey lead to the particular modalities you are working in now? How do these therapies help people? Christi Bemister: I work with individuals much the way I learned to recover from my own history of trauma. There is a path of very practical kinds of things that can help someone feel better right away while doing the deeper, more painful work. Laura Cowan: Tell me how the process works. Christi Bemister: I start out listening to why someone has come and the issues they'd like to work on. In the first session I ask them to touch something and to describe the sensation as best they can, then to check in with themselves about any emotional reaction\u2014like it, not like it, neutral? I suggest they do this with focus and purpose once or twice a day. Just to begin a practice of connecting and being present in their body. LC: That's interesting. We hear a lot about connecting and being present\u2014 mindfulness for chronic pain. Isn't that hard if you don't want to be aware of the pain you're in at the moment? Tell me about the process you work with to help clients through that. CB: So, here's what I do with people. It works in cycles, but a lot of it is linear. I emphasize that your body and life belong to you. We do sensory integration exercises\u2014using the senses to experience being in a body. First things first: boundary setting. Go through your closet/life to finish projects and clean closets. Practically speaking, how do you care for yourself and your personal environment? Do the colors on the wall reflect you, do you like the colors? Do the things you bring into the house reflect you, do you love them? All things hold good/bad energy. We feel best when things in our environment are in order and we love the things/colors in our environment. What small thing can you do to take something out that you don't love, or bring something in that you do love? I teach about choice: yes, no, maybe. Choose no matter what, then experience it. People will often say, \"I don't know,\" to questions. The question then is, \"What do you know?\" To have people begin to become aware of the many things they do know. This helps with self-validation. LC: I see, so you're helping people connect with the part of themselves that feels connected and empowered to make choices. CB: Yes. We're exploring: What's it like to make a clear choice? Structure is a good thing for safety and consistency, and we want to engage and learn something new to develop new resilience, clarity, self-satisfaction, and structure. Flexibility is a good thing for resolving anxiety. LC: You're helping people explore ways of being structured and safe. CB: It's also self-inquiry about ways of being that are rigid, inflexible, our expectations of others. We do a self-review of what life would be like if you were more relaxed. Then I work with people to resolve or stop the what ifs. Almost all of life's problems are solvable in the moment\u2014not in the future. LC: Okay, so if they get through that point in the process, how can they feel more comfortable in the choices they need to make? CB: The Realization Process I work with focuses on presence, emptiness, and groundedness. Build a dream of your best life and continue to think about it. Co-create with the universe. You have to teach your brain to create. This uses both sides of the brain and is an integrative healing process. LC: The visualization and planning process itself is part of the healing? CB: Yes, then we do exercises to unify and reconnect aspects of the brain to work together. We work with \"I know what I know, and it's okay.\" We can face pain, physical or mental, and talk through the hurts. LC: This is starting to make sense to me, because it involves both the visualization process and getting out of your head and trying new things. Healers of Ann Arbor Psychologist Christi Bemister Healing T rauma and Chronic Pain By Laura K. Cowan Science has made great headway lately into understanding trauma and the brain, and how traumatic stress affects physical health. I believe work like Christi Bemister's will help many people. \"I don't think I've ever seen someone in chronic pain, myself, who doesn't have a history with trauma,\" \u2014Christi Bemister The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 49 CB: All of this together works to help people clearly identify what is not working in their life and to create a way to be self-responsible to make choices that are healing. The work then opens a person up to experience and claim their body/mind/spirit as their own while resolving unhealthy adaptations they have made through life, often just to survive. LC: So, the process gets them out of the PTSD loop of survival mode and into a healthier way of being in the moment and taking action. CB: Yes, I help people with expressing emotions, teaching that those emotions are like waves and will resolve. The Realization Process is about learning to breathe into the core self, learning to be with pain by feeling it, breathing into it, in order for the body to relax. LC: Isn't that hard if it's chronic or severe pain or if we are choosing to take action others won't approve of? CB: We validate that bad or painful things happen, and they can be accepted. We also learn that it's okay to like what we like, even if no one else does. Learning that it's okay to be different or to experience and accept that you like what you like. We also learn to see red flags when one is being taken advantage of or being asked to adapt in some way that is not healthy, or when someone wants to merge and lose individuation. We learn how to recognize this as codependent and a relationship to say no to. LC: A core idea here seems to be that you are teaching people that they know what they want and what they need better than others do. CB: Yes, I know what's going on in my body better than you do. Many Realization Process practices are to get one connected to all aspects of their body, mind, and spirit, the experiences of their own unique qualities, and deepen their connection to themselves and thus to others. Through the weekend retreat, Bemister walked participants through several key points from the exercises above, to understanding what parts of the brain are at work in trauma and triggered chronic pain. Because of neuroplasticity, our brain can change. \"We have a thing called mirror neurons. They help us learn. We can watch somebody tie their shoe and learn by watching. Those are mirror neurons in action. It also means we're wired for connection. What we see and experience, we want to connect to that and have an experience in our own body.\" What happens in trauma is that we get rewired for protection, Bemister said. \"We lose that ability for connection, and now we are in a state of protection. We lose that ability to connect. But we can unlearn it. We can have lots of difficulty in relationships if we're not dealing with an open-hearted connection but are instead interacting defensively.\" Bemister and co-host Marcia Haarer ran participants through an exercise to become aware of the sensations in their body. I don't want to run you through the exercise without being able to support you through the followup, but I encourage you, if this sounds like a process that might help, to come try one of these retreats or work with Bemister in an individual session. The days are finally here when chronic pain doesn't have to be a life sentence. I do wish you well and hope that wherever you find answers for chronic pain and illness, you will remember to be proud of yourself for getting through the journey. You did this, you got yourself this far. You can do it. To connect with Christi Bemister PsyD PLLC, visit drchristibemister.com. Laura K.

T.E.A.L.\u00ae stands for Tell Every Amazing Lady about ovarian cancer. It is an organization (and national movement) started to help women identify signs and symptoms and urge them to seek medical help in its early stages, because ovarian cancer is often overlooked until it is too late. When it declares itself with debilitating symptoms, usually in stage III or IV, the prognosis is poor, so in an attempt to get the information out there, I share my cautionary tale. At 59 years old, cancer is my lived-experience. A lived-experience is having personal knowledge attained through first-hand involvement in events, and those perceptions become valuable narratives for phenomenological research. With an estimated 1.6M cancer cases in the U.S. in 2020, and with approximately 37.5% (600,000) fatalities, cancer is the second leading cause of death, and also a treasure trove of stories. While my knowledge is empirical, my husband has always expressed admiration for my ingenuity\u2014particularly with perseverance. Hence, I will share my survival secrets after being diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer. I endured radical debulking surgery, chemotherapy, Parp chemo maintenance medication, and conversations with two children in their early twenties about mortality. I was genuinely happy when undergoing the rigors of cancer treatment, in spite of social advocate and thespian, Anna Deavere Smith's description of chemotherapy in her one woman show, Let Me Down Easy. She states, \"Cancer therapy is like beating the dog with a stick to get rid of his fleas.\" It's rudimentary. Dr. Azra Raza concurs, the author of The First Cell , a memoir chronicling the treatment of her cancer patients. She wrote, \"Since 2005, 70 precent of approved drugs have shown zero improvement in survival rates while up to 70 percent have been actually harmful to patients.\" When close friends and family learned about my diagnosis, I thanked them for their concerns but, let them know I was good. Their remorse confused and inspired me to document the deeper journey of my joy, because ideas shape beliefs, and beliefs shape destinies. These lessons, or articles-of-faith, are for my children\u2014with the pulse of the Ella Fitzgerald song, \"Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered.\" Fitzgerald sings this song to a man, but in my mind, she sings to death, and so with the air of a jazz riff, I tried to recapture my lessons learned as if practicing the musical notes of a love song. Lesson number one: Believe in miracles. Our chaotic and stressful world doesn't offer us time or space to convalesce, but it is my testament, when honored, the healing journey is profound. I broach the phrase \"spontaneous remission\" cautiously, as it is unscientific and rare, defined by the cessation of a disease without any treatment or an unexpected cure with some treatment. In layman terms, it's about beating the odds. Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee, author of The Emperor of All Maladies , a cancer bible written in plain English and winner of the Pulitzer Prize, warns, \"I am not opposed to optimism, but I am fearful of the kind that comes from self-delusion.\" In concurrence, I say medicine saved my life, but spontaneous healing as a modality, if understood, works. Similar to Eckhart Tolle's spiritual definition of awakening, spontaneous healing must be experienced independent of thought to be realized. In an attempt to share my story, at times up-close-and-personal, I asked myself why this miracle befriended me. Oncologists frame their patient's survival rate against a five-year backdrop. I was diagnosed on January 8, 2020 with stage IV ovarian cancer and my chances of surviving until January 8, 2025 was 17 out of 100. This stat didn't factor in recurrence rate, only mortality; so in the next few years, it appeared I'd be negotiating for my life. I welcomed the challenge. My doctor said, \"Your attitude will benefit you greatly.\" Another physician friend explained that medicine doesn't talk about miracles\u2014everyday miracles\u2014because they can't be quantified. My instinct was to lighten my load and find humor in my unexpected and utterly terrifying diagnosis. You know the expression, \"If I don't laugh, I'll cry,\" and while cancer jokes aren't funny, it was vibrationally healing to enjoy a sick joke at my own expense. I felt better when laughing, like when I realized I lost all my hair before my balding husband which leads me to lesson number two: Find bliss. My go-to for healing aches and pains has always been a \"required reading list\" to help me find the appropriate words to articulate an experience. So, I did a deep-dive into cancer literature. In Cured, by Jeffrey Rediger, M.D., M. Div., he calls for clinical investigations to move beyond medical intervention and redress spontaneous healing which \"offers us a rare window into the root causes. We have a responsibility to study these cases and learn everything we can from them.\" He continues further down the page, \"I investigate just how interconnected radical healing is with our thoughts, beliefs, and even our most fundamental, often unexamined sense of self. I found myself asking the question: Can my identity, in some way, determine my ability to heal? The answer is both revelatory and complex.\" Honestly, spontaneous recovery wasn't even part of my discourse during treatment. I just kept laughing, smiling, and making snarky comments such that one nurse thought I was mentally unstable, when I just felt blessed. I spoke to my husband about these awkward moments, and he logically explained that cancer's high fatality rate requires reverence. In Dr. Mukherjee's cancer compendium, he states, \"Cancer was an all-consuming presence in our lives. It invaded our imaginations; it occupied our memories; it infiltrated every conversation, every thought. And if we as physicians, found ourselves immersed in cancer, then our patients found their lives virtually obliterated by the disease.\" Hence, my impetus was to turn-the-tables on death and rebalance the scales with joy and humor. A major hallmark in cancer treatment is a patient's one-year anniversary of living-cancer-free. Almost two years later, I am still in remission. Maybe I am one of the 17 in 100 who will survive. I don't want people to say I battled cancer. I want to be known for my joy, one moment after another, such indescribable experiences savored as memories. One of my favorite quotes from Esther Hicks, author and inspirational speaker is, \"When people say what are you doing? You say things that please me. And they say toward what end? You say pleasure. And they say but really what are you working on? And you say, having a good time. And they say, but what do you hope to accomplish? And you say, living happily ever after.\" Her teachings based on the Law of Attraction, focus on our positive vibrations, imagined or real, that reverberate and create a continued windfall of uplifting power. But, when enduring painful cancer treatment, finding bliss can seem impossible. Dr. Rediger in Cured seeks to identify a methodology toward wellness as explained, \"We need to place the extraordinary on the operating table so that we can dissect and learn from it, so that the possibilities for the extraordinary that exist within all of us are illuminated for everyone.\" I am by no means \"extraordinary,\" but I do think I should have been a comedian\u2014 except it's probably easier to survive cancer. My neighbor, concerned about my glib attitude, asked me if I ever cried during my treatment, and I said, \"Once.\" Soon after receiving my diagnosis, I read an essay that my youngest child wrote for an acting fellowship. The piece, which was about something I had taught her, was her way of saying, \"I love you, Mom.\" A real tearjerker. I made minor corrections and sent it back, commending her writing. I feigned exhaustion, but my daughter could read between the lines. Immediately, my older daughter called me to offer a pep talk. I relented and said I was afraid to leave them on this earth alone. My diagnosis was serious. I shouldn't make light of my circumstances. She agreed but articulated that my diagnosis can't preclude me from living a good life. She, as a cancer researcher, T ell Every Amazing Lady These Five Lessons By Carin Michaels While my knowledge is empirical, my husband has always expressed admiration for my ingenuity\u2014particularly with perseverance. Hence, I will share my survival secrets after being diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer. When close friends and family learned about my diagnosis, I thanked them for their concerns but, let them know I was good. Their remorse confused and inspired me to document the deeper journey of my joy, because ideas shape beliefs, and beliefs shape destinies. I broach the phrase \"spontaneous remission\" cautiously, as it is unscientific and rare, defined by the cessation of a disease without any treatment or an unexpected cure with some treatment. In layman terms, it's about beating the odds. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 51 has seen stage IV patients go on to live vibrant lives, including one who ran the NYC marathon. We laughed that night on the phone and determined that I had a choice: glass half-empty or glass half-full. Obviously, I chose the glass half-full, but decided to fill it with champagne. I never looked back once after receiving my daughter's permission to live my best life. It helped knowing she was happy and thriving. Prior to diagnosis, I led a very stressful life. I was a federal investigator raising two children with a husband who traveled for work and who had no family nearby. Regretfully, life's experiences also garnered me with another diagnosis of PTSD. I believe the aforementioned, along with my sugar highs, be it from Zingerman's Bakehouse or high-quality liquor, delivered me the cancer diagnosis, since cancer feeds on sugar and stress. There were no hereditary factors. At age 59, I awoke after an eight-hour surgery and was told my mass was malignant. My doctors performed a hysterectomy and resected my bowel and colon. I remember being unphased when learning this, probably because I was loaded up with drugs. During my stay in the post-op ICU, when the nurse tried to orient me to person, place, time, and situation, I answered, Carin Krishnan at St. Joseph Hospital on January 2020 with stage IV ovarian cancer, and that produced noticeable sadness in her. I wanted to say that my life wasn't sad. Instead, I asked her if there was a stage V cancer. Her eyes bulged, because there isn't one, so I immediately said, \"Just joking. That's me wondering if things could get any worse.\" We both smiled. My cancer journey, unbeknownst to me, began approximately one-year prior. I thought it was food poisoning from a hotel sandwich purchased at a spiritual retreat. When I confessed to fellow devotees that I had to take the night off because I was ill, they said our guru can bring out cathartic repressed physical reactions in all of us. This resounded over the next year. I had weight loss, experienced fatigue, pelvic pain, change in bowel habits (appropriately termed), vaginal bleeding, nausea, vomiting, and I would obsessively document these maladies with an online symptom checker to determine an appropriate diagnosis. I used the app so many times one day that it banned me from the site and told me to seek medical help, which I did, multiple times, in multiple towns, and was discharged with multiple diagnoses, all plausible given the test results. In my final iteration with doctors in October 2019, I recall one scheduler telling me that I could only be seen after January 2020. I begged for a sooner appointment because I said, \"I'll be dead by then.\" My intake exam was customary with instructions and a follow-up in four weeks. Recent bloodwork had been done by two other doctors. Within ten days, I called my newest doctor back complaining of severe abdomen pain. I explained that I needed to go to emergency department because the 1000 mg of Motrin daily wasn't working. I asked him if he could intervene and help me. Dr. Andrew T. Catanzaro of Huron Gastro in Ypsilanti, MI, discovered a huge mass in my lower abdomen the size of two large fists, almost six centimeters in size. Specific blood tests, a colonoscopy, and multiple scans later brought me back to my gynecologist who referred me to an oncology surgeon. The mass I was carrying was too large and intricate for a gynecological surgeon, yet my GYN doc told me not to worry, because my CA-125, the cancer blood marker, was too low to be cancer. She was \"pleasantly surprised.\" While waiting for my scheduled surgery two weeks away because of the December holidays, I felt like I was going to die. My symptoms became severe. I share them here because very few women rebound from a stage IV ovarian diagnosis and live to talk about it; besides, I want to pay it forward and be T.E.A.L. redeemed. I was nauseous and tired all the time; I couldn't sit up or stand for very long; I bled from my vagina, had diarrhea with occasional vomiting, and lost 40 pounds (which I was very happy about), but I began to have blood in my stool. The cancer perforated other organs. Before these egregious symptoms, it was assumed many were menopausal with irritable bowel or celiac disease. Remember, my CA-125 was 50, with a normal range 0 to 35. It was considered very low and likely indicative of diverticulitis. Even a friend and fellow stage IV cancer patient, who is a physician, told me her CA-125 was over 400. Also, I was told that a mass that large can't be cancerous, because I'd be dead. Looking back, I was dying. Lesson number three: Always trust your instincts (or listen to your partner's complaints) which leads me to lesson number four: Cancer patients need an advocate. There were so many technical terms shot at us that when the doctors walked into my hospital room, they suddenly looked like Greek gods who appeared wearing white togas to pass down ominous oracles. Words like total abdominal hysterectomy bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy omentectomy radical tumor debulking, open low anterior resection with primary anastomosis and enbloc of tumor complicated by post-operative hypotension and oliguria , were beyond my pay-grade. I decided to keep it simple and live in bliss, and the painkillers, of course used judiciously, helped. My husband, Unni and I were shell-shocked from the trauma and relied on our older daughter to be my patient advocate, which she did long distance, because during Covid, I was only allowed one person at my bedside, per day. The doctors, my husband, and my daughter would FaceTime, as I listened, barely remembering anything except that my husband was nearby. Unni and I were inseparable because we didn't want to lose each other. I recall him staring at my frail naked body hunched over while sitting on a plastic hospital chair under the shower with fear in his eyes. My body had a high probability of rejecting the unplanned colorectal surgery, and I might require a colostomy bag. I don't favor using technical terms here because they miss the pulse of the human heart, unless we're talking about cardiology. Needless to say, my husband and I were too numb to advocate for me, especially with cancer markers like High Grade Serous Carcinoma, HGSC, and the corrupt TP53 gene--both death sentences. Upon discharge, Unni homeschooled himself in oncology and took over as my local patient advocate. He lived and breathed cancer. Doctors enjoyed the rigors of his technical discussions. Unni has his PhD in biophysics, specifically brain science, where he builds mathematical models and computer programs to mimic the human brain. He could read medical papers, books, and consult physician friends and previous coworkers. Before I visited my oncologist at St. Joseph Mercy Ann Arbor Hospital, my husband called his medical colleague in Chicago, who went through her grapevine to inquire about my Ann Arbor doc's reputation. Dr. Brandy Michaels checked out with flying colors,and she eventually saved my life. Doctors are in the business of saving lives, so they do not mind if you have a patient advocate. They actually encourage it as your questions keep them on their toes to ensure they are providing good patient care. www.victoriaschon.comSacred Sound Journey Cacao Ceremony Sacred Instruments Online Shop Another physician friend explained that medicine doesn't talk about miracles\u2014everyday miracles\u2014because they can't be quantified. Continued on next page The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 52 With Unni as my new patient advocate, I felt safe knowing he was working hard to ensure my longevity. It's important not to worry when healing. Hence, lesson number five: Find love. I have a list of family and friends who I've thanked repeatedly for their help. My husband and I didn't have to cook for six months. It is critical to have a support system for healing, which for me included Unni, my patient-advocate-ninja. He relied on two friends specifically: one who is a nurse practitioner and works in oncology; the other is the physician I mentioned earlier who has stage IV cancer. She is participating in her second clinical trial\u2014part of a research study that tests new approaches to treating her type of recurrent cancer. Unni also called in some favors having worked in hospital settings and medical schools. Our friends were impressed by his cleverness. Unni loves solving problems. He discovered through his contacts that my stage IV diagnosis qualified for extensive genome testing at University of Michigan's Center for Translational Pathology in The Rogel Cancer Center. My patient-advocate-ninja had more questions than answers as to why a healthy person such as myself who exercised, ate well, meditated, and did yoga, got cancer and he thought U-M's Oncology Sequencing project would offer us deeper insights. When my report came back, some details were confusing. Unni wanted to discuss the findings in a supportive environment, so he looked up the name of the cancer researcher who signed off on my report. Unni discovered that they both went to the same prestigious technical university in India. Somehow given Unni's cleverness, he gets an invitation for chai at this researcher's house to discuss mutual collegiate experiences. When he sees this guy is affable, Unni confesses his real reason for being at his home: to better understand my genome report. My husband was doing everything in his power to keep me alive. But these efforts made me feel guilty. I didn't want him to hurt if I died. Suleika Jaouad, author of the eloquently written New York Times Bestseller, Between Two Kingdoms, A Memoir of a Life Interrupted, talks about living in the cancer canyon, from illness to recovery, herself diagnosed with early onset acute myeloid leukemia. Her title comes from a famous quote by Susan Sontag often used in cancer literature. \"Illness is the night-side of life, a more onerous citizenship. Everyone who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick. Although we all prefer to use only the good passport, sooner or later each of us is obliged, at least for a spell, to identify ourselves as citizens of that other place.\" As I continued reading, I feared that I lacked the sophistication or courage to discuss \"that other place\" with its harbingers of natural selection. I was a jokester. My highest achievement, aside from boasting about having the most frequent flyer miles in the nearby hospital, is that my two beautiful daughters came out of that system. But Jaouad expressed a desire to interrogate her illness. She was not afraid. Jaouad shared with readers of her blog \"The Isolation Journals,\" that in December 2021 the cancer, which almost took her life, had returned. While I initially thought Jaouad whined too much, I came to understand that she was speaking as a Bodhisattva warrior striving for unimpeded enlightenment. She said, \"I thought with incredulity how I won't get to see or do things and then I realized that my loved ones would be living with that grief of my absence in their lives, so I decided to make the most of my moments with them.\" The operative words here for me were \"living with that grief,\" and while this rite of passage seems universal, it reminded me of my daughter's fellowship essay. She exposed a layer of her grief then, and the kicker was that she quoted me. I had no idea she was listening intently a few years back when I said, \"Once in love, always in love. Even after 35 years of a challenging marriage to your father, he still teaches me about love.\" Her thesis, if my ramblings were correct, argued that her heart felt like it was breaking, having just come off a long-term relationship, and expanding, because of what she learned. Her life pulsed with emotions, and she had the means as an actress, filmmaker, writer, singer, and producer to work through her feelings. I could let her go and trust the universe would be kind to her. With my glass half-filled, I took the bull by its horns and embraced my \"other world.\" I remember during treatment that there were many tests. They were constant. My hair fell out. My nauseousness required stillness. My bones felt like drill bits were boring holes in me and my body felt old. I almost itched myself to death. While being poked and prodded, I found comfort in the book, Cured. I abandoned using the term 'life-lessons' and used the word 'beliefs,' because I didn't want to be a liar. We are all so unique. We are not whiners; we are winners given the fact that we make it to another day. Dr. Rediger addresses spontaneous remission as, \"I knew that whatever was happening wasn't primarily caused by something external.

Unni and Carin. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 53 these people's recoveries, as tempting as it might be to believe in these simple and seemingly clear solutions. Something was happening within these individuals that made their recoveries possible.\" Personally, I had dealt with many of my emotional issues pre-diagnosis with the help of a psychiatrist. Perhaps my atman, or pure consciousness, that being beyond identification with phenomena, attained liberation, and in the process my immune system naturally held-the-fort and did what it was called to do: rescue me. \"Today, cases like these are 'miracles.' Tomorrow, we'll look back at them and see them for what they were: steps in the long, steep staircase toward knowledge.\" Dr. Rediger's words continue to provide comfort. A vortex swallowed me whole in the industrialized cancer complex of hospital medicine. I found myself staring into the abyss\u2014which forced me to re-examine my psyche. It was like a self-induced age regression hypnosis where my husband's unconditional love, which I felt deeply, channeled all previous loves who supported me: my grandmother, my grandfather, my gay aunts who are my surrogate mothers, my father, my best friends, my girls, my previous psychiatrist. Sadly, my mother didn't make the list, but I heard Dr. Rediger say, \"Could this powerful feeling of being loved have been broadcast into [my] immune system, revivifying something deep within [me]? Whether it comes from a therapeutic session, a loving relationship, deep meditation, or focused imagery, love touches and heals something that medication can't touch.\" As a schooled practitioner of life, I knew there were no clear-cut salves like love to treat cancer, metaphorically or literally. Dr. Raza's cancer memoir speaks to this because as an oncologist, she not only intimately documents her patient's experiences, but her friends', and husband's cancer stories, too. She states, \"Cancer is what I had been treating for two decades, yet until I shared a bed with a cancer patient, I had no idea how unbearably painful a disease it could be.\" After chemo, my next line of defense, recommended by my doctor, was a Parp inhibitor, given to certain stage III and IV breast and ovarian cancer patients after chemotherapy, used as maintenance chemo in pill form. We agreed to give it a try. I deserved the extra 12 months of life it was offering, or rather predicting. This daily maintenance pill cost my insurance company $45,000 a month and it was more brutal\u2014for me\u2014than the chemotherapy. I joked that robbers could gladly enter my house and steal the medicine for its street value, but there wasn't any. The weekly blood tests that were scheduled for the initial four weeks on the meds, to ensure I eventually stabilized, never stopped. My blood counts were so low that I officially classified myself as reptilian. The fatigue was crushing. I became a zombie. I aired my complaints aloud to my husband, so when I had the courage to stop, he would agree. We were a team. At that point, I missed having a few good days during treatment and couldn't even remember what they felt like. Life can be fragile, but if these pills were really going to offer a 12-month add-on to my life, I chose the time remaining that I had left on this earth to be filled with joy. I stopped the medicine and even my physician was empathetic. It was the first time I felt understood. She accepted my defeat. But I walked away with so much more. We all live with a little black box of unknowing, a kind of knowing by not thinking, and under that guise, I let go of fear, and embraced spontaneous healing. Source lives in us all, and when we stop resisting, it shines. My doctor reminded me that \"it is not if my cancer returns; it is when.\" I said, \"If it comes back, I'm okay with that, because we've become friends.\" I'm not afraid of death. Maybe that's the miracle: I was fearless in this major shift. In the whirlwind of impermanence, I learned that my children can balance it, and with that, I moved into daily joy without my knowing it. Every day I focus on my abundance. I have enough. I can't impart any lessons because life mystifies me. I'm blessed to be alive and to be greeted every morning by the wind, the waving trees, the smell of spring, the birds' symphonies, followed by the sound of the rain on the blacktop, voices of children playing in the street, and the memory of when my girls came home recently. We had champagne and giggled about how silly I was to believe in miracles. We had a ninja party.

Officially known as \"Post-Acute Sequelae of Covid-19 (PASC)\" or \"Post-Covid Conditions (PCC),\" this constellation of lingering symptoms is commonly known as \"Long Covid.\" Many people want help with Long Covid, but it's hard to find. Specialty clinics like the University of Michigan Post-Covid Clinic have wait lists of six months or more. Family doctors are overwhelmed with patients. Worse, very few practitioners are comfortable treating the condition because research is just getting started and there is little clear guidance about how to best help patients. In this article, I will share what I learned from some local practitioners about current insights into Long Covid relief, and what kinds of alternative and holistic healthcare seems to ease symptoms.To research this article, I talked to three local holistic health professionals. Dr. Dennis Chernin, MD/MPH, who is the public health director for Shiawassee, Jackson, and Lenawee counties. In addition to his private medical practice in Ann Arbor, he is also a yoga teacher and tai chi practitioner. Dr. James Neuenschwander, MD, founder of the Bio Energy Medical Center, an integrative medical practice in Ann Arbor. Dr. Maria L. Gahry, DNP , RN, FNP-BC, family nurse practitioner with a specialization in complementary and alternative medicine. I am deeply grateful for their willingness to meet with me. The facts and figures I share here come from their ongoing reviews of scientific publications and their own experience with Long Covid patients. What is Long Covid? It's a simple question, but the answer is not. Different organizations use different criteria to define Long Covid. The CDC defines Post-Covid Conditions (PCC) as the \"wide range of health consequences that are present four or more weeks after infection with SARS-CoV-2.\" In contrast, the World Health Organization (WHO) defines PCC as \"the illness that occurs in people who have a history of SARS-CoV2 infection ... with symptoms and effects that last for at least two months.\" This leads to differences in the way cases are counted. From a patient's perspective, what it boils down to is that you're still not feeling well months after you've had Covid. Dozens of symptoms have been attributed to Long Covid. Some of the most common are fatigue and \"post-exertional malaise\" (which means symptoms get worse after physical or mental effort); fever; shortness of breath or cough; heart palpitations (fast heartbeat); problems with concentration, memory, or thinking; sleep problems; and anxiety, depression, or PTSD-like issues. A person may experience a few major symptoms, or many of them. Symptoms may also vary over time, with old symptoms disappearing and new ones reappearing unpredictably. Who gets Long Covid? Most studies have found around 20-30% of people who have had Covid also develop Long Covid. The main risk factors for Long Covid are age (over 40), obesity, asthma, and other pre-existing conditions. People who had more severe Covid illness are more likely to have lingering symptoms, as are people affected by health care inequities and access issues. Long Covid symptoms can also affect people who had very mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. Vaccinated and unvaccinated people can all get Long Covid, but since vaccinated people get infected with Covid at a much lower rate overall, vaccinated people have a 50% lower risk of getting Long Covid. It is also possible to avoid Long Covid after an initial infection but develop symptoms after a second infection. Avoiding Covid is the only known prevention at this time.Current research into causes We still don't know what causes Long Covid. The information below is based on research that was current in the early summer of 2022, and the doctors I spoke with stressed that new research is coming out weekly and each new study adds to\u2014or can drastically change\u2014our understanding of what's going on. Theory 1: SARS-COV2 damages body tissues directly. The SARS-COV2 virus has been shown to damage nearly every body system. Different variants seem to \"specialize\" in different tissues of the body. For example, the original strain showed an affinity for the lungs, whereas the Omicron variants presented more symptoms in the nose and sinuses. All variants damage epithelial tissue\u2014the linings of our blood vessels, organ cavities, and glands. One theory is that Long Covid damages blood vessels and creates extensive inflammation throughout the body. Theory 2: SARS-COV2 damage causes internal changes that further damage the body. This follow-on damage is seen in a number of ways. First is blood clotting. People who have had Covid often have an increase in blood clots. Those clots can cause further damage when they become wedged in blood vessels, cutting off oxygen to various tissues. In the brain, blood clots cause strokes of varying magnitudes. It's also possible that the body responds to SARS-COV2 by producing autoantibodies. These antibodies attack the person's tissues instead of the virus, causing autoimmune problems. This would explain why many of the symptoms we see in Long Covid are similar to those seen in other autoimmune conditions such as lupus, multiple sclerosis, and some forms of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Having Covid is also incredibly stressful by itself because of the cascade of issues caused by being ill. People may have valid concerns about losing their jobs, not being able to pay for treatment, or not being able to take care of themselves and their loved ones. Being sick can also bring on or exacerbate existing depression, anxiety, PTSD, and other mental health issues. These cause chronic stress which is damaging to the body's systems. Theory 3: The SARS-COV2 virus may not leave the body. There are several reasons our bodies might not clear a virus completely after infection. We might have an ineffective immune response and be unable to clear the infection for weeks or months. Parts of the spike proteins of the virus may linger, triggering an immune response long after the active infection phase. Or SARS-CoV2 might simply be a type of virus that goes dormant but never really leaves the body. There are many viruses that never leave the body entirely once a person is infected. Chickenpox is perhaps the best-known. After recovering from the acute phase of the infection, a person likely won't show symptoms again unless the virus resurfaces as a case of shingles years later. We've known for many years that the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis, stays in the body, and recent evidence suggests that it may be a cause of multiple sclerosis. HIV is another example. We now have drugs that can encourage HIV to stay dormant, but if the drug therapies are stopped, it can flare into a highly symptomatic AIDS presentation. SARS-CoV2 might also stay in the body, occasionally flaring up into periods of Long Covid symptoms. Theory 4: It simply takes a long time to recover from a serious illness. There is no denying that having and treating acute Covid is really hard on the body. Even life-saving treatments, like intubation and steroid treatment, can cause damage that the body needs to recover from. Given most people's work and home responsibilities and the lack of paid time off and support care, many people feel the need to resume their normal activities as soon as possible. This can draw out the recovery phase, as the body doesn't get enough time to rest deeply and recover. \u2014 Sick of This \u2014 Understanding Long Covid and Local Resources for Recovery By Emily SpringfieldThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 55 How can Long Covid be treated? Since we don't yet know the cause or causes of Long Covid, we don't yet know if or how to cure it. Instead, current treatments focus on addressing the symptoms unique to each patient. With so many symptoms currently attributed to Long Covid, it can be hard to know which ones to treat first. There are blood tests to measure inflammation (interleukin 6 levels), blood clotting (SCD40L levels), and some other biomarkers, which can suggest medications and other treatments for the most prominent issues. But it can be hard to find a doctor to perform the tests, and those who do often have a months-long waiting list. One of the best ways to help yourself recover is to support your body in as many ways as possible so it can heal itself. Here are some specifics: Rest and limit exertion If you have Long Covid, you probably feel like you are tired all the time, even if you are less active and you are sleeping more than usual. You probably want to get up and move more than anything\u2014to get back to your \"normal\" life. So, when you have a good day, you do all the things you've missed doing, and then the next day, you feel more exhausted than before. This is called post-exertional malaise or exercise intolerance, and it's very serious. It's extremely difficult to heal if you are stuck in a cycle of overexertion and crashing. Finding your \"safe maximum\" amount of activity will help you break the cycle and start recovering more steadily. If you have been accustomed to a highly efficient, achievement-driven lifestyle, you may need to make some fundamental changes in your routine and mindset. You might try the following: Lie down mid-morning and mid-afternoon for 15 minutes - being horizontal gives your heart a break from pumping blood up from your feet and provides a huge energy boost. Track your daily activities and set a daily maximum effort. e.g., keep total steps below a certain number per day. Recognize that you can't \"do it all\" and investigate shortcuts to reduce effort for a while. This might require compromises with some of your other habits or values\u2014for example, buying pre-cut packaged vegetables or driving instead of walking for short trips. Reduce stress We hear all the time that we should reduce stress, but it's hard to prioritize that advice because stress and its effects seem so nebulous. However, the connection between stress and Long Covid symptoms can be very direct. Stress increases activity of the sympathetic nervous system (the \"fight or flight\" response) and decreases parasympathetic activity (which, among other things, regulates digestion and healing). This has direct negative impacts on your physical state. There are ways to reduce stress: Reduce news consumption and \"doom scrolling\" on social media Breathing exercises\u2014slow, smooth \"belly breathing\" is most beneficial Meditation, yoga, tai chi, qigong, and similar mind-calming practices Give yourself permission to prioritize your own healing over others' needs Reduce inflammation High blood levels of interleukin 6 (Il6) indicate high levels of inflammation have been found in many Long Covid patients. One common form of treatment is to reduce systemic inflammation as much as possible. That can include... Stress reduction Gentle exercise like stretching and slow walks Anti-inflammatory diets\u2014there are various types, but most emphasize eating a lot of fresh, organic vegetables and eliminating \"junk food\" like sugar and deep-fried foods. If you know a certain anti-inflammatory diet works for you (e.g., vegan, pescatarian, paleo, no-nightshade), this is a good time to follow it. Support your body's healing All the practitioners I spoke to, plus dozens of people in the Survivor Corps Long Covid community, said that common holistic practices like acupuncture, massage, and gentle yoga are helpful for recovering from Long Covid. They help reduce inflammation, increase flexibility, improve breathing, and reduce the stress related to coping with a chronic health condition. You might try the following practices: Tissue-related therapies\u2014chiropractic adjustments, massage, shiatsu, lymphatic drainage, myofascial release, and other direct physical adjustments of the body Energetic/meridian type therapies\u2014acupuncture, acupressure, reflexology, tai chi-based healing, and similar therapies focusing on the energy flowing through the body Nutrition, toxin cleansing, and basic resilience therapies, including supplements, homeopathy, and medications as indicated for specific symptomsResearch similar conditions You can also take some cues from other conditions with similar presentations, such as post-viral fatigue, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome strokes, post-intensive care syndrome, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). While Long Covid is not identical to any of the conditions listed above, the research into and lived experience of those with these conditions can give us some clues on how to treat Long Covid. Where to get help I called a dozen Washtenaw County holistic healthcare providers, hoping to come up with a list of practitioners who are currently accepting new Long Covid patients. However, most of these great healthcare providers are already overwhelmed with patients, and some feel Long Covid is out of their area of expertise. Here are a few specific clinics taking patients, albeit with a months-long waiting list: UM Covid Clinic - adult\u2014allopathic, but multidisciplinary - must have a positive PCR test and referral from your primary doctor UM Covid Clinic - pediatric\u2014allopathic, but multidisciplinary - must have a positive PCR test and referral from your primary doctor RIM Rehab\u2014traditional rehabilitation; requires doctor's prescription Bioenergy Medical Center\u2014Integrative medicine center - no referral or PCR test required (interviewed for this article) If you can't get into one of these clinics, or while you are waiting, the following types of practitioners can provide supportive care to help you feel better as your body heals: Holistic chiropractors Acupuncturists Herbalists Supportive care practitioners like massage therapists and other hands-on healers Be careful with athletic trainers\u2014they may push you too hard unless they have experience rehabilitating people after illness (as opposed to after injuries) Avoiding Long Covid The only way to be sure you won't get Long Covid is to not get Covid at all. Get vaccinated. Avoid unmasked crowds, especially when cases are high. Wear a K95/N95 mask when in buildings other than your house. Wash your hands. Open windows and run an air purifier rated to remove viruses. Eat well, avoid toxins and pesticides, exercise, and reduce stress\u2014the more resilient your body is in the first place, the less likely you are to develop Long Covid after a SARS-CoV2 infection. If you do get Covid, rest and give yourself plenty of time to recover before returning to your normal pace. Once you are no longer contagious, consider one of the clinics above and support your body with good food, rest, and hands-on healing like massage, chiropractic, acupuncture, or other modalities.

Herbs, saunas, activated charcoal, juicing, and body wraps are just a few of the ways practitioners and patients have sought to rid the body of toxins and waste more efficiently. These different approaches have gone in and out of fashion, and with the advent of social media you can find any number of people claiming they've got the perfect shake, supplement, or potion for everyone to achieve a cleaner body. Let's face it, some of them are scams, but the theory is sound\u2014help the body detoxify and you'll have more energy, clearer skin, better bowel elimination, and avoid chronic illness later in life. I've seen Western medical professionals claim that \"detox\" is not really a thing to be enhanced, but rather something the body does just fine on its own without intervention. It's true that we have multiple ways to neutralize and eliminate toxins via our liver, kidneys, skin, and lungs. In a perfect environment with a nutrient-rich diet these processes would work efficiently and perfectly. However, these processes are often compromised or made sluggish by our lifestyles and exposures, making it necessary to support and assist the organs. The main categories of offending substances include metals, chemicals, and pathogens (microbes). These are found in our air, water, and food supply thanks to modern industrial and farming practices, and our reliance on antibiotics in meat production. Additionally, in our households they are found in many everyday items\u2014cookware, carpets, plastic containers, cleaners, makeup, air fresheners, shampoos, and anti-bacterial soaps. With the amount of toxic items we are exposed to through breathing, eating, drinking, and through our skin, it's kind of amazing we are able to withstand the assault at all! Unfortunately, these concerns do contribute to chronic issues for many of us, including allergies, asthma, skin conditions, autoimmune problems, fatigue, and eventually can lead to changes in cellular function that we ultimately call cancer. The symptoms and conditions that can be attributed to toxin exposure are innumerable, and based on clinical practice for decades, can mostly be reversed if we help the body more effectively detoxify. The first and best way to enhance detoxification is to minimize your daily toxin exposure. Drinking filtered or distilled water is essential and switching to naturally derived cleaners and skin care are important as well. Choosing responsibly grown meat and produce is better for you and for the environment. Using glass containers to store your food, minimizing plastics in your kitchen, and upgrading to ceramic, glass, or cast iron cookware are also great ways to lessen your daily load. You won't be able to avoid toxins in the world at large, so making your home and your workspace more body-friendly is key. A good quality air purifier at home and at work is a great investment and positively impacts everyone who lives or works in the space. There are great option for water filtration, and even home distillation, that are also cost-effective when you consider the money you can save on purchasing water, and also the money potentially saved on medical bills in the future. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 56 Sweating is an excellent way to get more toxins out through your skin, the largest detoxification organ. Saunas and exercise are two ways to enhance elimination through sweating. Dry brushing the skin is also helpful to remove dead skin and assist in lymphatic drainage\u2014another inexpensive but impactful practice to help your body do its best. There are also benefits to fasting diets, purification shakes, supplements, and juicing to name a few. I recommend consulting with a practitioner that is well-versed in these before deciding which is best for you and your current condition. This will ensure that you get the most benefit for your efforts, and you'll also be less likely to experience unpleasant side effects or problems if you've got someone to guide you through the process. Of course, having a green smoothie or fasting for a day are safe practices for most anyone without serious illness. Currently, there are excellent technologies available to assist in detoxification, including red light therapy, ionic foot baths, and infrared saunas. Depending on your current health status and your health goals these may also be something to consider. Ultimately, it seems our environmental toxin load is only increasing, so to improve your health now, and enjoy vibrant health in the future, it's important to adopt as many of these practices as possible for you and your family.

Sustainable HealthThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 57 Over the years, I-94 has been my go-to route to destinations throughout southern Michigan, but this trip I got off the fast-track west of Jackson to see what I've been missing. On M-60 I passed through the campus of Spring Arbor University, and glimpsed local museums and farms. Bedroom communities like Concord, Tekonsha, and Union City offered local eateries and attractions missing from interstate rest stops. Accustomed to the relaxed vibe of those villages, the industrial scene of Three Rivers was an unexpected shift\u2014a change experienced by travelers willing to take the less conventional path to Three Rivers' GilChrist Retreat Center. My sense of relaxation was restored as I surveyed GilChrist's landscape. My eye was drawn to a man walking through high grasses. Gazing longer, I realized he was traversing a large prayer labyrinth. Having previously seen only ornately manicured options, the labyrinth's 1.5-mile path blended naturally with the property, a reflection of GilChrist's approach of embracing the surroundings. Two stocked ponds were added to the property in 2017 and seem ideal for swimming or perch fishing, but their role is to support ecosystem development. The ponds provide a focal point for land-based outdoor meditative practices and nature walks for guests. GilChrist's deference to nature was also evident in its approach to accommodations. Touring the property via golf cart, I noticed mature woods surrounded each cabin\u2014which were widely dispersed\u2014an ideal option for guests seeking a secluded setting. Without wifi, phones, or televisions, the modest cabins reinforce a low-tech respite with a focus on not only nature, but spirituality. Each cabin has a distinct theme with spiritual undertones such as Hinduism, Judaism, and naturalism. The cabins' intersection of nature and spirituality provide visitors a unique space for relaxation or reflection.I appreciated the aura of peace that resonated from the grounds and cabins, but felt a special connection with WindHill, the main house situated between the labyrinth and cabin areas. While exploring publications focused on well-being at the library, I reflected on my visits to the Crazy Wisdom Bookstore. Surveying WindHill's meditation loft, I was reminded of my introspective experiences enjoying refreshments in the Crazy Wisdom Tea Room. As a primary location for meetings, WindHill serves as a gathering space encouraging knowledge, sharing, and support akin to the Crazy Wisdom Community Room. WindHill amenities, including Wi-Fi service and additional lodging options, means the house is a focal point for many GilChrist activities, while the retreat center's 67 acres provides numerous outlets to support well-being. Visitors can traverse the woods and meadows on foot, yet golf carts are available for mobility support if needed. On the eastern end of GilChrist, guests can explore The Stone Chapel, a volunteer-constructed building particularly suited for solo or small group meditative activities. Although meals are not provided at GilChrist, guests are welcomed to peruse the vegetable garden on the western end of the property for items to use to prepare dishes. Alternatively, visitors can engage local catering and restaurant establishments for meal arrangements. The variety of accommodations and amenities available at GilChrist means the retreat center can accommodate a variety of guests including solo travelers, couples, families, groups, and service animals. The intrigue of GilChrist extends beyond the physical property. As part of the Fetzer Institute, the retreat center supports a philanthropic organization with a mission to \"build the spiritual foundation for a loving world.\" GilChrist's facilitated activities reinforces Fetzer's efforts to support people \"seeking to deepen their experience of the sacred in everyday life.\" As one of several retreat locations within Three Rivers, GilChrist resides within a \"thin space\"\u2014a Celtic Christian concept of a location where heaven and Earth are especially close. Described by Kevin Koch, author of The Thin Places: A Celtic Landscape from Ireland to the Driftless , they are \"locales where the veil between this world and the otherworld is porous, where there is mystery in the landscape. The earth takes on the hue of the sacred among peoples whose connection to place has remained unbroken through the ages.\" Three Rivers' character as a thin place was explored in the 2016 PBS program Three Rivers Spirituality ( pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/2016/11/11/three-rivers/33301/). GilChrist, along with St. Gregory's Abbey, Hermitage Community, and Apple Farm Community, provides a nexus of resources for persons to explore their spirituality, engage with nature and/or, renew one's body. Though not familiar with the concept of thin spaces prior to visiting GilChrist, I must concede that a sense of peace and self-awareness seemed to envelope me as I explored the grounds. The retreat center was large enough for me to have my own space, but also had a sense of intimacy to foster a feeling of oneness with nature. Modest and comfortable, GilChrist provides a welcomed escape from the external noise\u2014allowing one to focus on the internal. Learn more about GilChrist and its fall events at fetzer.org.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 58 A Jolly Old Elf By Jennifer Carson Bring a little magic into your holiday season with this jolly old elf. Made from scraps of wool felt and a bit of ribbon from your stash, he'll be adorable hanging from your Yule tree, decorating a package, or pinned to your lapel. Materials needed: Wool felt in colors: red and skin tone of choice Embroidery floss to match hat and skin tone, plus white and blackEmbroidery needleScissorsWool stuffing Two tiny, black seed beadsScrap of ribbon, lace, or other adornmentCurly mohair locks, or other fibers for hair, beard, and moustachePink colored pencil or blushPin back, buttons, jingle bells, or other adornment as desired To get started, trace the pattern pieces onto freezer paper. With a warm iron, press your pattern pieces onto the wool felt. Cut the pieces out of the wool felt, then repeat the process so that you have two head pieces, two ears, and two hat pieces. Mark the eye placement, noted by the dot on the pattern piece, lightly with a pencil. Match your head pieces together and pin in place. With your needle threaded with two strands of embroidery floss that matches your skin tone choice, stitch the pieces together with a tiny blanket stitch following the diagram. Knot your thread well, but don't cut it.Stuff your head with wool stuffing. If you don't have wool stuffing, regular fiberfill will work, too. Stuff his nose well! Gather the edge of the now stuffed head piece. Add more stuffing if needed to make the head full. Gently pull the gathers tight so that the head closes. Tie off and bury your thread end. We are going to give the face a little dimension by putting in a few stitches. Starting at the back of the head, push your needle through the head and exit at the right nostril. Reinsert your needle and exit out back of head, pull gently. Repeat if you need/want more indentation. Do the same for the left nostril. When both nostrils are indented, push your needle back into the nostril, and exit just a little above to make the side of the nose. Move your needle over just a bit toward the outside of the head and reinsert and exit out the nostril. Do this stitch 2 to 3 more times, then repeat for the other side. Knot your thread at back of head. To indent eyes, anchor your thread in the back of head, insert needle through back of head and exit at eye. Move your needle over just a bit (you want to keep your stitches very close together!) and exit out the back of head. Pull gently and repeat. When you are happy with the indentation, repeat for other eye. Knot your thread at back of head. Sew your eyes in the indentations you just made with two strands of black thread and tiny seed beads. Fold the top edge of the ear over just a bit to create a small \"fold.\" Pin ears to head and stitch in place with matching thread.With white embroidery floss, stitch eyebrows and sew pieces of curly locks under his nose. I also sewed a lock of hair onto the top of his head. Use your colored pencil, or some blush, to brighten his cheeks.Sew the hat with a tiny blanket stitch as shown on diagram below. Don't cut thread, yet. Place hat on your elf (over his ears). You'll need to cut a line from the edge of the hat to where the top of the ear is\u2014it might take a little trying on, snipping, and then trying on again to get it right. Pull his ears through, adjust the narrow strip in front of ears until you like the fit. At the bottom of the head, whipstitch the two pieces of the strips together. Then with a tiny blanket stitch, sew hat around face. Knot thread and bury end when finished. Sew on any embellishments you'd like! Add a pin to the back of his hat to make a wearable piece of art or put a hanging string in the curve of his hat to hang in your Yule tree. I hope you enjoyed making your very own jolly elf.

But there I was, standing in Lakeside Party Shoppe, located a stone's throw from the shores of glistening Whitmore Lake, waiting to pick up my order from Eli's Blazin Wings + Pizza. As the name implies, Eli's is not exclusively vegan, and yet it's so much more than just chicken wings and pizza. For such small square footage, they have an incredible menu that makes me feel like I'm at a neighborhood backyard barbecue party. Eli's uses only fresh ingredients to make their roughly fifteen original recipe sauces, spice blends, and dry rubs. Meat options include fried chicken, barbecued ribs, and seafood. You can also choose wings, sandwiches, pizza, and salads. The sides are downright homey with things like potato salad, coleslaw, baked beans, and brown sugar biscuits. For dessert, there's warm chocolate cobbler, salted chocolate chip cookie pizza, bourbon pecan pound cake, and strawberry lemon gooey butter cake. My mouth is watering just writing that. I don't think I have ever before been impressed or excited by a menu's salad options. But Eli's House Salad, made with fresh strawberries, candied pecans, and crumbled goat cheese on mixed greens and drizzled with an apple cider honey vinaigrette was unbelievably delicious, satisfying, and sang of summer. It was difficult to choose between that and the Boss Lady, kale topped with roasted cauliflower, sunflower seeds, toasted almonds, crumbled goat cheese, and dried cranberry with a lemon herb vinaigrette.The salads are not the only vegetarian or vegan option. You can also order vegan wings in the form of battered cauliflower or oyster mushrooms. There are vegan \"chicken\" sandwiches and burgers. You can also order vegan Italian sausage and vegan pepperoni on your pizza with vegan mozzarella. The pizzas also have a gluten-free crust option, and you can order crispy gluten-free wings. Having multiple food restrictions, I often have to tread lightly around barbecues. But at Eli's, I had so many options, I genuinely had a hard time narrowing them down. I was worried the cauliflower wings would be just an afterthought to satisfy the odd vegetarian customer, but they were packed with flavor. The coleslaw was fresh and crispy. I think I could eat the House Salad every day for lunch and not get sick of it. My husband loved the Sticky Honey Chicken sandwich, which I watched him eat with envy. It only took me 15 minutes to drive from downtown Ann Arbor, and it was worth the trip. This would be a great place to order buckets of food for a party, and there is enough variety to satisfy every palate. Eli's Blazin Wings + Pizza is located at 52 Barker Road in Whitmore Lake. They are closed Sunday and Monday, and open Tuesday through Thursday from 11a.m. to 9 p.m., Friday and Saturday from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. For more information visit elisblazinwings.com or call (734) 449-5252. What's In Your Cup? Juice And Smoothie Cafe Smoothies are a refreshing and satisfying treat, even when serving as a quick lunch. What's In Your Cup? Juice And Smoothie Cafe on Ypsilanti Township's south side is the perfect place to grab a delicious smoothie packed with fresh, healthy ingredients. They have amazing soups, wraps, and salads too, and everything on the menu is \"vegan, dairy free, and mostly organic\" (per their website). The raw juices are freshly made from real fruits and vegetables. They each have a fun name like Beet-It (beets, carrots, orange, apple, and lemon), Spin-Gin (spinach, cucumber, lemon, and ginger), and Cucumber Blast (cucumber, spinach, celery, lemon, and orange). The smoothies are just as well named with the Kale-Yeah (kale, spinach, orange and lime juice, mango, pineapple, banana, and coconut water), Mang, Tang, Bang A takeout counter in the back of a party store is not where I expected to find amazing vegan food. Eli, the owner of Eli's Blazin Wings and Pizza, and his daughter Jaiden.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 61 (mango, orange and lemon juice, and coconut water), and Yum-Me (strawberry, orange, pineapple, lime, banana, and coconut water). My hands down favorite, though, is the P&B Smoothie (peanut butter, banana, and almond milk), which is like the thickest, most delicious milkshake. The Best Southwest really was the best Southwest Salad that I have ever had. (It also comes as a wrap.) The vegan imitation chicken was really quite impressive. It was juicy and tasted just like grilled chicken. If I hadn't known it was vegan, I probably would not have guessed it. On my next trip, I will have to try the Asian Persuasion (cabbage, soy chicken, carrots, red peppers, sesame sticks, and peanut sauce). I'm a sucker for a good peanut sauce. For the especially health-minded, one ounce shots of fresh wheat grass are $2.96. You can also order house chips and dips to share with a group, a bowl of hearty soup, and a cupcake (vanilla, chocolate, or banana) in case you still need to satisfy that sweet tooth. The seating is casual and comfortable, and there is a fireplace to cozy up to when the weather turns cold. It's the perfect place to meet a friend, and the staff could not be friendlier or more passionate about eating healthier. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask! Located only a short distance south of the I-94 Huron Street exit, What's In Your Cup? is a much more gratifying, healthful, and, dare I say, delicious option than fast food. What's In Your Cup? Juice And Smoothie Cafe is located at 1816 Whittaker Road in Ypsilanti Township. They are closed Sunday and Monday, and open Tuesday through Saturday from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m. For more information visit whatsinyourcupcafe.com or call (734) 340-9097. Throughout the pandemic, First Bite remained committed to its vision of a healthier lifestyle. All packaging materials for take-out and delivery orders were made from compostable resources. In 2021, outdoor seating was increased. On weekends, there were ten tables outside, and greenhouses with heating were added for the chillier months. All attention was paid to their customers' safety and comfort. And the food has only gotten better and better. The omelets are fluffy and packed with vegetables. The toast is crisp, and the sandwiches are gratifying. Everything is fresh and bursting with flavor. When food is made with care, it shows. Everyone at First Bite clearly takes pride in their work and takes care of every customer. Dalela would also like to thank the taxpayers. \"Without the PPP loan,\" he told me, \"We never would have made it.\" Each of us can reap the rewards by stopping in for a cup of coffee, a smoothie, or a freshly made, nourishing meal that's good for the body and the soul. First Bite is located at 108 South Main Street in downtown Ann Arbor. They are open Monday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. For more information visit www.firstbitefoods.com or call (734) 369-4765. My hands down favorite, though, is the P&B Smoothie (peanut butter, banana, and almond milk), which is like the thickest, most delicious milkshake. First Bite We featured First Bite after it first opened five years ago in issue #68. Anyone who has been by for brunch on the weekends can attest that First Bite has become a beloved part of the downtown neighborhood. Owner Vivek Dalela was kind enough to speak to me about First Bite's success and its commitment to Food 4.0: positive food, positive life. \"We have been reasonably successful because we try to offer our customers more value,\" Dalela shared. \"[First Bite] is probably the most organic restaurant in town. We have organic maple syrup on the tables.\" And First Bite strives to do it all at a reasonable price. \"We never want customers to say it's too expensive.\" But high-quality food at a reasonable price isn't the only thing to which Dalela credits the restaurant's success. \"We have a like-minded team to execute that value,\" he said. \"The team is the key.\" 2020 was a desperate time for restaurants, especially independent ones, but the First Bite crew remained committed. \"They knew how serious the situation was,\" said Dalela. \"They never complained. We stayed open at all times because the team was available at all times.\" Sanitary conditions were immediately put in place, and First Bite signed up with DoorDash and GrubHub and offered take-out and delivery.When food is made with care, it shows. Everyone at First Bite clearly takes pride in their work and takes care of every customer.First Bite Owner, Vivek Dalela The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 62 By Angela Madaras Photos By Susan Ayer When the pandemic started in March 2020, restaurants had to close their doors for a bit of time to re-group. Most were able to provide delivery, no contact pickups, and take-out options. During this time, mobile food folks had an edge. It was truly amazing how food businesses, from farms to restaurants, figured out new ways of operating in a short period of time. York Food and Drink (and many other alternative eateries) made the change successfully and super-fast. This article is about York primarily, but also about some of the mobile cooks and chefs who have become extremely popular because of York's willingness to invite them into this new outdoor dining experience. Customers seemed happy to have many food options they may not have tried before. York inspired several food businesses to adapt to this new model of eating and drinking safely while creating a larger community based on sharing space and co-creating for everyone's benefit. I have been joyfully shopping and dining at York Food and Drink for many years. They offer a variety of sandwiches, salads, seasonal soup, and baked goods, as well as cured meats and cheeses so one can create their own nosh board. They will customize any order to fit the customer's dietary wishes. My favorite is the Cali sandwich filled with smoked turkey, avocado spread, smoked Gouda, red onion, tomato, and lemon basil aioli on toasted eight-grain bread. They make the best Americano I've had in the states. Additionally, I enjoy all of the richly diverse mobile food cooks and chefs who operate out of community kitchens, local food stores, food trucks, food carts, and gathering spaces. I have tried many while visiting York. The innovative folks from York have inspired many foodies from every walk of life in our area and beyond. Some of them collaborate, and many use locally-sourced ingredients to grow our regional economy. I had many questions for owner-manager and founder Tommy York and co-owner Sarah Okin about the business model that inspired many others. I am sharing just a part of what was shared, but it is enough to know that this business is about people and community. They feel it is their duty to create an indoor and outdoor space that brings people together in a safe and entertaining way. They give much to charities, while also bringing in DJs, food trucks, and artists to help them pay their bills. I was touched each time I visited and left feeling grateful for the food, drink, and camaraderie. Angela Madaras: When did it hit you that the pandemic called for a complete change in your business practices\u2014like online ordering, food truck courtyard, outdoor dining, and expanding the wine sales room? And what gave you the idea to offer heaters, a small fire pit, DJs, rotating food trucks, cocktails, and a family-friendly environment? And how did you make it happen? Tommy York: About a month or two after the pandemic hit in mid-March 2020, we had the funds and the people, a website ready for creating an online ordering platform, a supportive community, and lots of hard work. We worked up to ninety hours a week for a few months in order to accommodate our customers and our vision for the future. My degree in social work and seven years at Zingerman's, gave me the tools I needed to make a swift change. I always had a passion for helping people and supporting community. It took every single person involved. My neighbors, family, customers, and others left very large tips, sent us money to keep the doors open, and some folks bought gift certificates but never used them because the community wanted to see us succeed in serving the public. I was raised to volunteer as a child and help people in need. My parents instilled in me that \"you How York Helped Forge a New waY oF diNiNg out Tommy York inspired several food businesses to adapt to this new model of eating and drinking safely while creating a larger community based on sharing space and co-creating for everyone's benefit. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 63 are special, but not too special.\" These ideals, and patience, got me through it and keeps me going. I was fortunate that my wife Julie was so supportive\u2014I could not do it without her. Angela Madaras: What other major changes were made in the way you run your business as it relates to your community and its seemingly temporary needs? I assume you felt the pandemic would end and perhaps you could go back to \"normal\"? Tommy York: We created a place reminiscent of the \"good old day's neighborhood\" or family reunions. We were able to get an additional permit to serve alcohol in our outdoor food-entertainment area. We realized quickly that this model was here to stay, and we were lucky enough to have the space to expand and meet the needs of our staff and customers. Angela Madaras: How many owners, managers, and staff do you have? Tommy York: There are five of us \"owners.\" Each has his or her own focus. We make a great team. Our staff is fabulous and works hard to make customers happy. We could use more steady staff, but so can everyone. Staff counts change regularly. Angela Madaras: Are you aware of the impact you made on the food scene? There are now about a half dozen local food joints mirroring your model, with their own twist. Tommy York: I will let Sarah answer that question. She is a working partner who handles human relations, social media, and communication, plus many other tasks. The family-friendly party vibe in the courtyard was her and her husband's vision, so I'll let her explain. Sarah Okin: My husband and I lived in London for a number of years and would frequent pubs on the weekends. The Sunday Roast is an institution in England, and we wanted to create that atmosphere for our young family, our friends, and the broader community\u2014to create a space that was safe for kids to roam and fun for parents to enjoy food, drink, and conversation. We got the idea for the Sunday Spin from our days on Brick Lane\u2014live DJs and long hours spent in the sun with friends and kids over the afternoons. DJ Batz (Aaron Batzdorfer, our lead Sunday Spin DJ) was the one who suggested we add live art to the event, and of course it was perfectly on brand with the vision that all of York's partners share: creating a shared community space for art, music, quality food and drink, and positivity . Olivia Chadwick, events producer, was the one who decided to schedule two pop-ups:we host one that serves a meal and one that serves a dessert! This event is very special and is even being copied at other establishments locally. When the start of the pandemic forced so many of us to close our doors, we quickly shifted operations outside into our ample outdoor space. We gave all our tenants a generous break on the rent and invested the little cash we could scrape together into making the outdoor space beautiful and enjoyable. Contributing to the atmosphere were the fire pits, murals, colorful chairs, rocks, drink rail, plants, and kids play furniture, too! We had our biggest sales day ever in February 2021, outside, in a pandemic, in Michigan. People were starved for safe options to do what they love, and we provided them with a way to make it happen. We also decided it was our responsibility to be generous and share what we had--a safe space and a small but mightily loyal customer base. So, we began inviting pop ups to sell their food to our customers\u2014we felt that if we had found a way to survive the pandemic, we should share our good fortune with other small businesses who were struggling. This is my favorite part--lifting others up\u2014as one of my friends always says, 'A rising tide lifts all boats.' We invited any pop up who wanted an audience to sling their food at York. For the first two years we charged nothing, and our crew added work to their plates to ensure things went smoothly. Now we charge a nominal fee which we reinvest into the food truck/pop up program enhancing electricity, equipment, and advertising. We added DJs who were looking for new ways to make money to our weekend evenings. We reached out and lifted them up as well. Two of our crew members, Chelsea Koga and Lorena Ganser, launched an online art auction using York's Instagram account. They collected pieces from our crew members and others in the community and sold them on a donation-auction basis. It was extremely ingenious and helped bring in some extra cash during a time when cash was so tight for everyone in the industry. We got some cool press coverage on that, but most importantly, our crew and their friends got some much-needed income when businesses were shuttered. We are grateful and innovative. Angela Madaras: Tommy, what is your favorite part of the business? Aside from the incredibly satisfying Euro-style York fare for breakfast, lunch, and cocktail hour, they also serve up Ricewood BBQ's permanent, in-store window service for tasty BBQ. It was truly amazing how food businesses, from farms to restaurants, figured out new ways of operating in a short period of time. Ricewood BBQ located inside York. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 64 Tommy York: Making people happy and comfortable by creating a public space to hang out, to eat, drink, listen to live music, play games, participate in an art show, and so many other community events. I love the feeling of family within the entire business from owners to staff to customers. Our job is to create a space for all to enjoy...and we do. Angela Madaras Do you have any advice for food truck owners and mobile food people? Tommy York: Find good mentors and try it for a year. Be patient. Surround yourself with people who will tell you the truth whether you like it or not. And do not be afraid to accept help. Noah Kaplan is another invested partner in York. Kaplan's success in starting a successful speaker company, Leon Speakers, over twenty years ago in Ann Arbor, and being part owner of Mothfire Brewery, gave him the funds to invest in York. He acquired the building and remodeling the old space into what it is today. It includes the parking lot behind York, the large capacity courtyard where they are able to serve creative adult beverages and a wide variety of food for every taste bud. Aside from the incredibly satisfying Euro-style York fare for breakfast, lunch, and cocktail hour, they also serve up Ricewood BBQ's permanent, in-store window service for tasty BBQ. Plus, the permanent food truck called Boa Boys is parked outside at one end of the courtyard. Some nights they offer free music and entertainment or just some hip music to groove with food and drink. It is one of the best places to see, and be seen, any time of day or night as well as every season thanks to fire pits, heat lamps, and umbrellas for shade. Ricewood BBQ shares York's kitchen with a designated service window. The smoked BBQ offerings from Ricewood is an American-meets-Asian street food shining through in sandwiches, rice bowls, spicy wings, brisket, Szechwan chicken, burritos, tacos, and hamburgers (depending on the day's specials). You can buy BBQ by the pound until they sell out. I love their rice bowls with Szechuan chicken or pulled pork. I also love the smell of wood coals cooking meat. It draws one to the flame like a moth. Bao (bow) Boys have a permanent food truck parked out back of the courtyard featuring Asian-style steamed dumplings called \"Bao Buns\" filled with a variety of Asian fusion fillings from vegetarian mushrooms to spicy pork to one that elevates Spam! The pillowy soft buns cost around $5.00. I suggest three per person. They also offer a rice bowl featuring pork belly, Japanese-style poached egg, and vegetables in a dashi broth. York sells all sorts of healthy food options in the grab-n-go case with a Euro-Spanish twist like the spicy Italian bocata or Caprese salad. They have a daily frittata, bagels, toasts, a seasonal soup, crisp green salads, deli classic sandwiches, Spanish bocatas (sandies on a baguette), baked sweets, and a kids' menu. On top of that, they offer cheese boards served with olives, meat if desired, and a baguette. They also sport a beautiful full bar serving craft brews, handpicked wine options, inspired cocktails, classic cocktails, and neat pours, thus providing an experience inspired by European markets, bars, and caf\u00e9s. You can take advantage of a small bar outside and in the evenings a bar tender-server will help keep your drink topped off. The expansive wine room sells small estate wines with regular tastings and specials. Tommy York does not care if you bring food from Anthony's Pizza next door as long as you purchase your beverage at York. He wants all businesses to thrive. This type of goodness gives York good karma and a loyal customer base. Check their website for events, guest food trucks, and pop-ups. Visit York Food & Drink at 1928 Packard Street in Ann Arbor.

Another location inspired by the York business model is Homes Brewpub, also in west Ann Arbor. They provided year-round indoor-outdoor seating before the pandemic and later, they opened a second location at 112 Jackson Plaza along with Dozer Coffee, The Can Shop, and Smooj Lab (beverage bar) where Homes beers and Smooj canned hard smoothies (adult beverages) are the main focus. They have a brewery production facility plus a large community kitchen and gallery that has more than ample seating. They bring in mobile food businesses as well on a regular basis so check their events page for updates. Their website states that, \"Homes Campus is a look at tHe local mobile Food busiNess a N ew waY oF diNiNg out continued .......... a creative community of businesses centered around the Homes Brewery production facility, just down the road from the brewpub. Come hang with us.\" My first visit to Homes Campus was to taste Brava Empanadas after I had a text conversation with owner and cook, Silvia Parra McCarthy. I asked her if she could prepare a good sample of her Argentinean Empanadas that were either frozen, or partially cooked, so I could sample at home. She said she could and included heating directions for each type of empanada. Sadly, I did not meet her when I picked them up, but I enjoyed meeting her sons and sharing information about their extremely popular business. The authentic empanadas were each perfectly created with a crust that crunched a little around the edges then melted into a buttery-savory morsel. There were fillings such as ham and cheese (an Argentinean favorite), spinach and cheese with a creamy b\u00e9chamel sauce, chicken Portuguese, ground beef with onions and hardboiled egg, mushroom with mozzarella cheese, caramelized onions and seasonings, and corn with Spanish and green onion, red and green pepper. If you like Central and South American cooking, then food trucks are for you and Brava is currently the only Argentinean food truck in our region. A popular African food truck in the USA, Fork in Nigeria, happened to be at the Ann Arbor Farmers' Market one Saturday. I was excited to try a few items from the menu! The owner and staff were warm and calm as the line started to snake around the truck. They suggested a juice called Zobo while we waited for our lunch to be cooked. I have no idea what the beverage was made of, but it was a cold, red, aromatic drink that was not too sweet and had a little sour pucker along with cinnamon undertones. We ordered small meat pies for appetizers with a flaky-buttery crust that did not fall apart while nibbling. We enjoyed a chicken and rice dish served with lightly cooked vegetables. The sauce on the chicken had a little fire kick. I was exceedingly happy with the food and the people who made it happen. In contrast to spicy African fare, I tasted from several excellent BBQ trucks: PB&J BBQ, Good Eats, and Baby Bear Burgers plus the Pierogi Queen, Sanich Union, Friendly Foods Vegan Kitchen, Moon Sky's Cheesesteaks and so many others cooking all kinds of good food. There was even one amazing fire-baked pizza truck called PizzaPazza that parked occasionally at Erratic Ale in Dexter. The authentic emanadas from Brava Empanadas were each perfectly created with a crust that crunched a little around the edges. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 65 Erratic Ale is another wonderful outdoor and indoor brewery with a small food menu and big hearts. They do a lot for the community and have events, musicians, and fun family nights that residents can bike and or walk to. Every time we have visited, they are packed, so get there early. I actually visited PizzaPazza food truck there twice because the first time blew my mind and I wanted to know if one could call in an order to bring home for reheating. The answer was a resounding yes! The Chef's name is Jeff Condit who was friendly and kind. They do parties and will park just about anywhere. When you find them, ask how in the world they can get a wood-fired pizza oven to cook pies in three minutes from a truck! We tried the Sausage and Peppers Margherita which was very saucy with a lot of fresh basil and fungi that rocked my mushroom-white pizza fantasies, and Vegetali with an abundance of Swiss chard, Kalamata olives, roasted tomato, garlic, EVO oil, mozzarella, and ricotta. Each pie was scrumptious with a perfectly baked crust and a tinge of burnt bits around the edges. They also have a larger catering menu from which to choose. I could write all day about every food truck or mobile chef-cook with whom I spent time. I was touched by each person's generosity and kind spirit. I usually struck up conversations while they cooked and helped other customers, yet I was never made to feel like I was being a bother. There are now many places where trucks park such as farmers' markets, White Lotus Farm, Ann Arbor Distillery, Erratic Ale, York, Homes Campus, and a few other spots listed in the directory (see sidebar). I encourage all our readers to support these folks and leave generous tips! I could write all day about every food truck or mobile chef-cook with whom I spent time.

I enjoy getting my hands dirty, the daily watering routine, and the weekly fertilizing. Early fall is the best time to receive the earth's bounty. Pumpkins, squash, and assorted herbs are plentiful. Depending upon the richness of the soil, and the amount of water the garden received over the summer months, the taste of the plants grown each year will be unique to that season. These distinctive flavors should be savored. I can think of no better way to show thankfulness for the harvest than to enjoy a cup of tea made from plants and herbs found in my own garden. Several herbs can easily be cultivated in the Michigan climate. Plants such as lemon balm, bergamot, chamomile, peppermint, spearmint, lavender, and anise can thrive with the right amount of sun, water, and patient tending. Dried fruits such as apples or cherries can also be added to make more interesting flavor blends. When making your own loose leaf herbal tea you should do a little research on the plants you intend to use. It is important to know which parts of the plants are edible and will give you the best quality of flavor. Some parts of the plant might have a more bitter taste. It is also important to harvest the plants at the peak of their growth to reap their nutritional benefits and enjoy their full robust taste. The plants can be dried for later use in a couple different ways. The herbs should be well washed and sorted into small manageable bundles. Then, you can hang the small bunches upside down in a warm, dry environment. Make sure to keep them out of the sunlight and that there is good airflow between the bundles. You can also dry the herbs in the oven on low heat. A dehydrator can also be used. Once dried, you need to keep the plants in an airtight container such as a glass mason jar with a snap lid. You should avoid plastic since it retains and can create moisture. Two of the easiest aromatics to grow and dry are chamomile and mint. Chamomile has a beautiful daisy- like appearance. The yellow center of the flower when dried can be used to make tea. The flavor is slightly floral and earthy. It pairs well with apple and peach. I like to add bits of dried apple when steeping for a sweeter taste. Mint grows where there is a lot of rain and sunshine. Once you plant it in your garden you will be hard pressed to get rid of it. Tea can be made from the leaves of spearmint or peppermint. Where spearmint has a nice fresh taste, peppermint tends to be stronger. Though mint mixes well with bourbon and rum, chamomile pairs well with gin. So, instead of a gin and tonic, why not try an iced chamomile tea with gin? Iced Chamomile Tea with GinSteep dried chamomile in 1 cup to 2 cups of boiling water for up to 5 minutes or the desired darkness you prefer. Chill for one hour, then add a half a cup to a full cup of ice and 1 shot of your favorite gin. Drink, relax and enjoy the spirits of fall. Peggy A.

Made possible by the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization Michigan Urban Farming Initiative (MUFI), the project, known as America's first sustainable urban agrihood, aims to combat challenges unique to urban communities such as Detroit. More than 120,000 pounds of food are grown from seed from this portion of Detroit's land, which was once abandoned. According to the all-volunteer organization's website, the MUFI utilizes the agricultural neighborhood, or agrihood, \"as a platform to promote education, sustainability, and community while simultaneously reducing socioeconomic disparity.\" Vacant, unutilized land, and a lack of food security are concerning issues that have led to a lost sense of empowerment within the surrounding community. The MUFI's adaptive use of the land on which it resides, and the existing environment, demonstrates sustainable urban farming practices and, in turn, is an effective strategy for increasing food security. A Model of Innovation & Sustainability The urban farm began as a humble community garden under an adopt-a-lot program in 2011. Now, the operation scales a much larger area spread over several acres near Brush and Custer, demonstrating creativity and innovation for the use of space. In 2011, anyone could relocate to Detroit due to the vacant land. \"You could take over a vacant lot, and as long as you kept it up and showed good stewardship, the deed was transferred to your name after ten years. In 2013, that changed,\" said long-time volunteer Michael Willard. Working on numerous parcels of land, the organization acquired additional lots from private owners and county foreclosure auctions. However, the early years saw some difficulty obtaining deeds to other properties due to the city's requirement for approval of larger-scale land use. Although the city seemingly recognized the agricultural efforts as positive, they cited higher priority items such as affordable housing opportunities as reasons for their resistance. The lots owned by the MUFI through adopt-a-lot went into a government organization, the Detroit Land Bank Authority. After raising the assessed taxable value for the eight lots, the nonprofit put forward the funds to purchase the lots. However, Willard said the city denied their proposal, citing that they had earmarked the land for mixed-use development. After years of negotiations, the organization finally purchased the lots in 2018. \"However, we aren't allowed to grow further until 2028 in the city of Detroit.\"Not only does the vacant land provide a foundation for various fresh foods to grow, but the existing structures also offer an opportunity for cost-competitive blight deconstruction that doesn't necessarily involve demolition. The historic North End of Detroit is one of the city's neighborhoods facing gentrification. While this process typically bestows negative impacts, including forced displacement, discriminatory behaviors by people in power, and exclusion of low-income individuals and people of color, this area of Detroit is embracing the process of changing the neighborhood's character through culturally rooted leadership and methodologies. The agrihood is a relevant, positive difference-maker in the majority black community. Innovations in blue and green infrastructure further demonstrate the intelligent use of space. For example, a fire dilapidated home adjacent to the plots where food is being grown serves as a water harvesting cistern. Since water and sewage are expensive in the area, using the property as a water collection system provides cost-effective farm irrigation and avoids stormwater run-off. \"One of our biggest challenges as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit is paying for the water. Our bills can be hundreds to thousands of dollars per month sometimes. So, we have the cistern to complement our water system.\" Additionally, plans for a long-vacant three-story apartment complex involve the collaboration of businesses to redevelop the space into a multi-functional community space. Several companies, including BASF, General Motors, PPG, and others, are partnering together, finding viable ways their materials and resources can assist in the building's transformation. According to a 2017 press release, MUFI president and founder Tyson Gersh said, \"We're emphasizing efficiency with some of the most sustainable, progressive building products and techniques available today. Our Community Center will serve as an example of how we must reinvent the way we plan our buildings, neighborhoods, and communities.\" The premise for these projects lies in Gersh's belief that Detroit presents the opportunity for sustainability and innovation in looking toward the city's future. Many speculate that this project, once finished, will be a showcase example\u2014one of the most sustainable, energy-efficient buildings in Detroit. Key Features MUFI's farm began in 2011 as a quest to enhance the neighborhood and provide a valuable resource to residents. In 2017, the agrihood was featured as a model for sustainable urban planning at Sustainable Brands 2017 global conference, held at the Cobo Convention Center in Detroit. Forged out of necessity and the urgency to relieve the plight of the surrounding community, the agricultural space boasts orchards, gardens, a hoop house, a seed container house, a community center, and a cistern. Willard said about ten total projects are occurring. \"They're all in different phases, but the most complete project is our farm.\" Detroit Nonprofit Paves the WayDetroit Nonprofit Paves the Way for Innovative Urban Agriculture Tucked into a three-acre section of Brush Street in Detroit's North End lies a utopia of freshly grown foods available to the surrounding communities at no cost ... More than 120,000 pounds of food are grown from seed from this portion of Detroit's land, which was once abandoned. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 70 Not all the projects are farm specific. For example, the community resource center, previously utilized as a three-story six-unit apartment complex, continues to undergo rehab and will house administrative space, multi-purpose space for meetings, training, workshops, yoga classes, and more, a production and packaging kitchen for value-added products, and a for-profit farm-themed marketplace. The brick-floored hoop house also has a neat location for rehearsal dinners and other gatherings. \"We're open to a lot of different things,\" said Willard. Key features of the farm include more than 300 vegetable varieties which provide about 20,000 lbs. of produce annually. The food grown on the land is free to over 2,000 households, food pantries, churches, and businesses surrounding the farm. Healthy, fresh-harvested foods picked by volunteers are available at the easily accessible, on-site produce stand, which is open every Saturday. Nothing goes to waste, as MUFI donates any leftover at the end of the day. The organic movement is woven into the grassroots farm and its processes. \"All our stuff here is organic, except the flowers,\" said Willard. \"We are a no-till farm, and we don't treat with pesticides. We use fertilizer, but it's all-natural, such as worm castings. We're all about organic here.\" \"We have over 350 varieties of produce including six types of lettuce, 22 varieties of peppers including 11 sweet and 11 hot, three varieties of cabbage, nine to 11 varieties of eggplant, 11 rows of collards, 22 varieties of tomatoes, nine to 11 varieties of each summer and winter squash, beets, radishes, onions, beans.\" There are herb and perennial sections as well. In addition, a century garden furnishes strawberries, blackberries, boysenberries, huckleberries, honeyberries, and champagne grapes. \"There's a big population from the South because of Detroit's automotive industry. When I first started volunteering here in 2015, we only had four rows of collards. But because of all the people here from the South, there was such a huge demand for them, so we increased the number of rows,\" said Willard. \"Also, no one knew what kale was, but everyone was requesting kale by the end of that season.\" The high-density fruit orchard boasts around 200 fruit tree varieties-Detroit's most diverse and dense urban orchard. Apple, pear, plum, peach, and cherry trees have taken root there; each selection fit for Michigan weather to ensure optimal productivity.A Need for Improved Food Security According to a 2022 report by Governor Gretchen Whitmer's Food Security Council (FCS), \"the social determinants of food insecurity have the greatest impact on the nature, scope, and causes of food insecurity. There is an interconnectedness between poverty, health, and food insecurity.\" Determinants include racial and ethnic inequality; health, age, and disability status; and poverty, income, and unemployment. The FSC was initiated to increase funding for fresh and culturally appropriate food through local and regional programs, expand childhood nutrition programs, improve food access, and improve access to resources, to name a few. The MUFI's agrihood addresses these issues. In the FSC's report, the finding that \"high food insecurity rates correlate with pronounced racial disparities...\" indicates several areas of Detroit as subpopulations vulnerable to food insecurity. For example, while statistics show that approximately 1.3 million Michiganders faced food insecurity in 2019, 2020 proved incredibly challenging, increasing to 1.90 million Michiganders facing food insecurity, including 552,000 children. In addition, 22% of black households and 17% of Hispanic households were food insecure in 2020-a stark contrast to the seven percent represented by white households. A 2019 food security report specific to Detroit showed that 39 percent of households were food insecure and that there was a $500M loss in retail grocery revenue. As shocking as they may be, the high food insecurity rates correlate with pronounced racial disparities, such as those found in urban areas with predominately black residents. Healthy food access and affordability are dominant factors, especially in low-income communities such as Detroit's North End and others under-resourced. Innovative Urban Agriculture continued... While food distribution methods and assistance programs adapted, the state still witnessed disproportionate access to food across the population. The Covid-19 pandemic placed a seemingly insurmountable hindrance on food insecurity in Michigan, as it led to unemployment, the loss of in-person learning, and a set of new economic challenges. While food distribution methods and assistance programs adapted, the state still witnessed disproportionate access to food across the population. The implications of food insecurity stretch beyond hunger. According to the CDC, four Michigan counties, including Wayne County, have over $100 million in healthcare costs associated with food insecurity. In addition, Bread for the World Institute research found additional costs related to food insecurity. These include educational expenses, costs incurred by students dropping out of school due to food insecurity, and those \"based on the value of poor educational outcomes and lower lifetime earnings due to hunger and food insecurity.\" Food Desert, Food Swamp, Food Apartheid?While some industry professionals argue that we can't classify Detroit as a food desert, there is no denying the lack of physical access to retailers that stock healthy, nutritious foods, let alone affordable foods, in many areas. Food initiatives such as urban and community gardens, independent retailers operating in areas of low food access, and charitable food programs, including mobile food markets and grocery recovery programs, are suggested targets for more significant investment from the State of Michigan. By the Department of Agriculture's definition of a food desert, about 10 percent of Detroit could be classified as a food desert, as there are small pockets without easy access to grocery stores organizing the city instead as a \"food grassland.\" Program manager of research and policy at the Detroit Food Policy Council, Amy Kuras, agrees that Detroit can't be labeled a food desert. Instead, it may be a food swamp, indicating difficulty finding fresh food if you don't know where to look. In January, Kuras told the Capital News Service, \"All the major thoroughfares, especially once you get out of the downtown areas, it's fast food, coneys everywhere.\" Where people have more economical needs, food swamps tend to cluster. Additionally, food apartheid refers to the idea that the lack of food isn't random; instead, it is a consequence of something else. Due to the amount of policy, planning, and racism in the area, people perceive Detroit negatively-as a place not to do business. These factors make residents rely heavily on party stores or convenience stores for food.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 71 Racist policies, the perception of crime, and Detroit's depopulation led to many grocery store chains closing. Around three percent of the area's food outlets are made up of supermarkets and large groceries, and fewer than half of the city's food outlets consist of fast-food restaurants, gas stations, and liquor and convenience stores. However, the food outlets such as MUFI and other urban farms, community and school gardens, and farmers' markets are often left out and unaccounted for due to these being unrecognized and unsupported by many policies. These outlets make a significant impact on food justice, and that leads to improved food access. According to Willard, \"The closest store to the Michigan Urban Farming Initiative is Whole Foods.\" However, how much does fresh, organic produce at stores such as Whole Foods cost? \"The neighborhood here is socioeconomically diverse. A lot of people in this neighborhood are renters. Even myself, I live in a suburb of Detroit and can't afford Whole Foods. People can come to the farm and get organic produce for free.\" The urban ag epicenter keeps data on where the food goes. \"We have the data backing, showing where the food is going and how it's utilized. I don't think many people realized how great of a need there was for what we are doing here. There are 1,500 urban gardens in Detroit, but to be an urban garden, you only need a couple of tires and a couple of plants.\" Some urban gardens closed due to the labor and time-intensive care required to manage them. Promotion of Inclusion and Diversity\"We are 100 percent volunteer-driven. Our foremost tenet is food insecurity,\" said Willard. \"We have people from the community come here; we were originally intended mainly for the North End. But, since we started in 2011, we've started getting people from other communities-Metro Detroit, Livingston, Macomb, Oakland, Wayne, and Washtenaw counties, all over. In addition, people come from all over the world in the summertime.\" Volunteer groups include local and suburban schools, outdoor gear and apparel store Moosejaw, churches, and corporations such as General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, and Henry Ford Academy, to name a few. According to Willard, MUFI is not religiously based; however, \"we welcome people from all walks of life. Everyone from toddlers all the way up to seniors come to help. We accommodate everyone and any ability.\" From Memorial Day through December, the farm is bustling with volunteers working the farm. Over 100,000 volunteers have contributed their time and efforts since 2011. Surrounding communities may not have a lot of exposure to farming and agriculture, so Gersh finds it important to teach best practices and to bring conversations on \" ...I don't think many people realized how great of a need there was for what we are doing here. There are 1,500 urban gardens in Detroit, but to be an urban garden, you only need a couple of tires and a couple of plants. \" \u2014Michael Willardagriculture and farming to the area. MUFI is establishing these connections for the community and bringing fresh food options to this Detroit neighborhood are a priority. While it requires year-round dedication, countless hours of manual labor, teamwork, innovation, careful planning, and behind-the-scenes strategic work, everyone benefits. The original vision was one of aesthetically pleasing and presentable land use. \"We are laid out like a production level farm, to maintain that aesthetic of looking like a farm, rather than utilizing the raised bed style gardens some community gardens use.\" However, vandalism has become prevalent in Detroit area farms such as this. \"Last year, we got broken into 11 times; this year, we've been vandalized three times as of a week ago and nine before.\" We've had tools stolen out of a volunteer-built woodshed. People have tried to break into every structure on our campus.\" Vandals broke the upcycled windows that compose the seed container house because they seemingly thought there were construction tools inside. Additionally, \"In 2016, we won a contest for $40,000 from Scott's Miracle Grow for our century garden. Another organization called Sit-On-It Detroit builds these benches to place at bus stops throughout Detroit. Well, we had it in our budget because of the money we won, so we purchased a couple of benches. Within six months, people snatched them up. It's constant,\" Willard said. \"What we really need right now is the community to come out and volunteer. It's great that we give away free food, but additional volunteers, especially from this community, would be really nice to see.\" Unfortunately, Covid-19 put a damper on volunteer turnout, as many still take precautions. Willard said he relocated back to his home state from California and quickly found his place with MUFI. \"The school I went to had alumni service day. One organization had 300 volunteers, and this one had three, so I showed up at this one. I liked it and kept showing up on Saturdays.\" MUFI's agrihood is more than beautiful floral blooms, plentiful fruit trees, and a produce-producing garden. Its underpinnings run deep in the space of inclusion and accessibility, and its processes are a platform for education and awareness in a time and place of diverse needs. The beauty of the gardens, orchards, and buildings is more than surface deep. It encompasses complex implications such as combating food injustice and repurposing otherwise dilapidated and vacant establishments. The efforts would not be possible without the help of volunteers, as well as donations and partnerships with community members and organizations. Ways to support programing costs include shopping through Amazon Smile, Kroger Community Rewards, and monetary and cryptocurrency donations.

Sustainable agriculture relies on Michigan communities to engage in projects such as this one. The future for food security has the potential to keep improving with generous people who continue to make a difference every day. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 72 The year was 2015. We pulled into Washtenaw Community College's Morris Lawrence Building in Ann Arbor. We arrived half an hour early not knowing what to expect of crowds or the venue as this was our first holistic psychic fair. (Yes, we were psychic fair virgins). Arriving early turned out to be a wise choice as an increasing stream of cars began pulling in. We walked to the entrance and waited, chatting casually with others in line. Anticipation, intrigue, and child-like joy bubbled throughout the line. Once inside, to the left of the admission line, were holistic practitioners setting up their mini treatment centers. Massage tables, foot baths, colored lights, and technologies unknown to us awaited visitors' trials. To the right of the line, vendors were tweaking their displays. Crystals, oils, books, artwork, and more stretched across the expanse. Posters on the wall touted that free lectures and psychic readers could be found down the hall. It evoked a something-for-everyone giddiness. I didn't know at the time that this entire event was primarily thanks to the efforts of intuitive Amy Garber and co-founder Christina DePugh. They had built upon a small group's vision in 2013 and steadily expanded the offerings each year until 2020 when the pandemic put in-person events on hold. The Ann Arbor Holistic Psychic Fair became the largest of its type in Michigan as it gave a common arena for holistic practitioners and psychic intuitives to assemble in a mutually respected village for one or two days. Many of the practitioners highlighted in Crazy Wisdom articles have had booths, done readings, or attended informative lectures through these fairs. Though Garber feels 2022 is too soon to risk creating a potential super-spreader event with an in-person fair, she has been far from lax in her continued nurturing, normalizing, and educating of the greater Ann Arbor area on holistic and psychic matters. In the interim, a prior psychic vision blossomed into a reality: she expanded The Enlightened Soul Center & Shop with a new location on Carpenter Road. Firmly based on Garber's passion, the \"goal is to provide great holistic programming for the community. This includes renting spaces to practitioners and groups to practice the holistic and intuitive arts.\" The new center hosts 2,674 square feet with a large event room, a small kitchen classroom, and individual rooms to rent. The variety and frequency of offerings is impressive. Just a few of their events include lunchtime yoga, sound baths, a queer magic seekers group, Reiki sharing, and channeling demonstrations. Classes offered also cover intuition development, divination, mediumship, nature spirits, tarot, and voice channeling. You can also book a session with one of the practitioners. In addition to Garber as a spiritual counselor, others offer visionary energy work, medical intuitive healing, art interpretation and oracle cards, psychic mediumship, oracle alchemy, and clairvoyant mediumship. Amy Garber \u2014 Promoting Holistic and Psychic Realms for a Quarter of a Century By Michelle McLemore Photography by Susan Ayer The Ann Arbor Holistic Psychic Fair became the largest of its type in Michigan as it gave a common arena for holistic practitioners and psychic intuitives to assemble in a mutually respected village for one or two days. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 73 Additionally, the center hosts online learning events. As other practitioners and holistic businesses had to close their doors during recent years, Garber was able to build a center for practitioners to continue their offerings and expand light working without the financial strain of owning or renting one's own physical business. She hopes to eventually add two mini fairs a month\u2014like a mini version of the psychic expos. She envisions vendors in the parking lot under tents with psychic readers and discussions inside. \"I am building on a hybrid model, not just a store. I want to be of help. That's what I'm in it for,\" Garber explains. How did Garber come to have the courage and passion to support holistic practices and psychic fairs on a grand scale when others had not? Her story: Garber grew up in Oak Park, a suburb of Detroit. She attended Berkley High School and then transferred to Southfield Lathrup High School after her parents' divorce in the mid-1970s. After high school, Garber earned a BA in Fine Arts and Literature and Language from Kalamazoo College. \"Though,\" she confides, \"if they would have had a journalism school, I would have done that.\" Instead of stepping from the waters of intuition into public life, as some life-long psychics may experience, Garber's was a different process. Growing up in a \"culturally Jewish\" family, there wasn't much discussion about intuition. Though she began doing informal readings for friends in 1993, it wouldn't be until years later, as an adult, when she met an uncle who had psychic abilities. \"He became my mentor. He ended up doing roughly 900 readings in life. The general family today still doesn't believe in it.\" Yet, as a child, Garber remembers being drawn to the 1970 movie On a Clear Day You Can See Forever . It was an American musical comedy-drama-fantasy in which Barbra Streisand plays a psychic. She also recalls frequently watching the night sky, waiting and hoping to see a UFO. \"I'd always had a peculiar interest in certain occult or paranormal things like the Shroud of Turin (which is odd because I'm Jewish). Edgar Cayce was also an early read.\" Garber explained, \"When I teach, I give people hope\u2014you didn't have to be a psychic child. We all wake up at different times.\" \"If you've ever shared information with someone and then said, 'I don't know where that came from!' then, you may have already gotten 'inspired' or 'channeled' messages! Each person has their own timing. It's our energy\u2014everyone has some type of intuition. It can help guide us and make choices.\"For Garber, intuition comes through the means of hearing (clairaudience) and seeing (clairvoyance). \"The challenge is to be aware of it and listen to it. When I am clear, I hear it. Sometimes I argue with them [guides/spirit]. But I am sorry for it later. I can't imagine living life without it.\" Metaphysical training for Garber started in 1993 with Spiritualist ministers Rev. Shala Kilmer, Revs. Edward and Annette Jones, and Rev. Ken Nowaciewski, among others. Eventually, Garber helped found the Center of Light Spirituality in Oxford, Michigan and later served on the Board of Trustees of the Interfaith Center for Spiritual Growth in Ann Arbor. In the 2000s, \"I took a freelance editor job for the Washtenaw Jewish News as a side job, copy editing. Also, I reached out to Bill Zirinsky at the Crazy Wisdom Community Journal. It was like an intuitive download\u2014I should get paid for reading something I'm interested in!\" Working at CWJ also created the opportunity to do readings in the Tea Room. Laughing, Garber reminisced, \"I don't know how I did it in the Tea Room. I would offer readings at night when the live music was going on just across the room.\" Her eyes twinkled admitting, \"It definitely helped me hone my focus. I never adapted to using any tools. That was too much work\u2014not my thing.\" So, what is a psychic reading like? \"I often work with my eyes closed when I am 'tuning in.' The reading is more of a conversation with you. The information comes in the form of feelings and pictures instead of a flow of words or thoughts. As always, however, I rely on Spirit to direct the form and function of the reading. I strive to translate the client without interpretation on my part.\" In an April 2021 Crazy Wisdom ezine article, (crazywisdomjournal.com/weekly-48) Garber also emphasized the importance of the client's participation. \"I understand clients may want to hear 'proof' and therefore may wish to withhold facts from the reader until the reader has confirmed these details. However, it is detrimental to the reading for the client to be passive and unresponsive throughout the entire reading. If the information doesn't sound right, it is important for the client to bring this up immediately, so the message can be re-worded, clarified, and explained if necessary. Usually, misinformation is just a misunderstanding, or a problem of semantics.\" In tracking Garber's intuitive and career development, she acknowledged one main theme: \"The universe finds ways to push me to get me to go where I need to go\u2014sometimes like Noah, like the Bill Cosby sketch.\" Garber's own facilitated group started with a grad student saying a metaphysical group, \"sounded like fun.\" They used Meetup.com. This led to renting the back room at Crazy Wisdom once a month. Then, two Sundays a month. The momentum kept building. In tracking Garber's intuitive and career development, she acknowledged one main theme: \"The Universe finds ways to push me to get me to go where I need to go\u2014sometimes like Noah, in the Bill Cosby sketch.\" \"When I teach, I give people hope\u2014you didn't have to be a psychic child. We all wake up at different times.\" \u2014Amy Garber The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 74 \"In January 2012, I co-founded a group named Intuitives Interactive for intuitives, adult indigos, empaths, and other lightworkers. (This group would eventually fold into the Enlightened Soul Center's offerings in 2018). Also in 2012, the HGTV show \"House Hunters\" contacted Crazy Wisdom Bookstore for a psychic that would be willing to participate for an Ann Arbor episode. Bookstore representatives chose Garber. She recounted, \"I accurately described the house that the client would ultimately choose, and it was confirmed when the show aired on April 8, 2013.\" However, they didn't tell her anything regarding her accuracy at the time of her interview nor up until the airing. Since that time, Garber has added home buying/selling consultation to her repertoire of services. \"People may know they have a feel for a new place, and I see a map in my mind of where they are being drawn to. It might be two places and Spirit tells the differences between them. Or, if local, it may feel in a certain geographical direction and looks blah, blah, blah. I can get colors, shapes of houses, and more.\" In tracing her rise as a holistic center director, Garber's eyes grew wider, and she gasped slightly. \"Wow, 2013 was a big year! I had the vision of the center in 2013. One of the regulars at the Interactive Sunday group said, 'I think you are going to be famous for something\u2014and it's not your readings.'\" They both laughed. The friend hadn't meant anything derogatory about Garber's psychic abilities. \"She said it was something else, so I sat and went within. I saw a center, like a director of a holistic center. That night I did a meditation and took notes. I drew out a schematic. Spirit was giving me this information. It would be a combination of readers and healers. They would work together and refer to each other. It would have a caf\u00e9, and events gathering space, and a gift shop.\" She beamed. \"That was the dream. I was led... and pushed.\" And the center today is bringing the dream to fulfillment. Garber's Intuitives Interactive group also helped nurture her to begin teaching. In 2015, after repeated requests, Garber began teaching intuition development classes. (Today, she offers three levels of such classes). She also founded her private business, Metafizzy LLC, at that time. Garber became certified in Medical Intuition through Living Aware Inc. with Tina Zion. Additional training came from Constance Joy Hart in Past-Life Healing. These can be done in person or over the phone. \"I love doing readings for individuals, couples or pairs, groups, and parties!\" Garber explained, \"I'm a skeptic. So, if I have direct experience and can validate it, then I can bring it in. I trust my own experience. Along the way, I had a profound experience, and so I remind everyone, Einstein proved it. Time is a continuum. We can go back and go forward.\" She shared one experience when past life healing made a world of difference to a client and her three-year-old daughter. The daughter was petrified of taking a bath. The mother knew instinctively the child had drowned in a prior life. So, during the mother's past life regression session, she witnessed the child (who was also a family member in the prior lifetime) begin to drown. This time, however, the present mother stepped in to save the daughter and reassure her, she was fine. Post session, that night when the client went home, the mother found her daughter was suddenly no longer afraid of the water. Not a bit. The universe kept prodding, and in the spring of 2016, Garber co- founded the Enlightened Soul Center for the Holistic & Intuitive Arts. Meanwhile, she continued training. Garber became certified to perform personal clearings and space clearings through Diana Burney of Earth Release . In 2016, she was ordained into the Priesthood of the Order of Melchizedek. In 2018, she would add graduating from the Shamanic Healing Program by Marjorie Farnsworth of Spirit Assist LLC, and Shamanic Practices with Kate Durda and Stephanie Tighe of Spirit Weavers to her repertoire. Certification as a Reiki Master teacher and Rahanni Celestial Healing (Pink Ray 5 th Dimensional Energy Healing for the New Age) soon followed. Garber wanted to clarify, \"I don't call myself a healer. I was more like a kid in a candy shop\u2014an attunement junkie.\" She was excited to learn about everything metaphysical. In addition to offering channeled readings, by 2017, Garber added classes for others to learn how to channel. Mediumship, to Garber, is different than channeling. \"During a mediumship reading, you may ask me to call in certain persons who have passed on, but I will not channel a deceased loved one by inviting them to share my body nor energy.\" One idea, or message, that kept coming up in our interview was a strong belief: \"There are no coincidences, we are never alone, and we are always loved.\" Garber said this underlines every reading. That being said, Garber doesn't believe in fate necessarily. \"Synchronicities occur by being aware and in the flow of the Universe, not by blocking things. I believe in reincarnation, recycling of souls, time as a Amy Garber \u2014 Promoting Holistic and Psychic Realms for a Quarter of a Century Posters on the wall touted that free lectures and psychic readers could be found down the hall.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 76 By Cashmere Morley At age five, Paula Hampton knew that there was something magical about art. The way her mother would hold a pencil to paper and make a face appear on a blank canvas, unaided by anything save her imagination, blossomed a world of possibility in Hampton's heart. It also sparked a question: Could she do that, too? Conjure something out of nothing? Like the pencil to canvas, Hampton's life unfolded before her into several avenues: figure artist, portraitist, and AT&T phone operator, to name a few. Today, she prefers the title \"wand maker.\" An Ypsilanti native her entire life, Hampton cut her artistic teeth working alongside figure artist John Lockhart, at Washtenaw Community College. Under his tutelage, she gained a profound understanding of the human body, a skill that would later help her unfurl forms in felled wood when wand making became her profession. \"You don't just draw,\" said Hampton, \"...You study the human form. You study anatomy, just like if you're going to school to become a physician. I had to learn all the human bones in order to understand structure. And how, when a human form moves this way , then the light changes across it that way. I had to translate that on the paper to shadow and form so it became a work of art.\" Translating the three-dimensional onto a two-dimensional piece became her early living. In the 80's, living in Depot Town, Hampton did not have to go far to find work. Literally outside of her apartment door, Depot Town landlords helped establish the Heritage Festival, where Hampton was asked to be a resident artist. Her studio was situated in one of the old AirTrain railroad cars, where Hampton would sketch portraits alongside of her friend, another resident artist, who was working as a basket weaver. Through her time as a portrait and figure artist, Hampton would often ask friends to sit for her. A pair of these friends\u2014a couple of local pagans, who lived on a farm on the outskirts of town\u2014invited Hampton over one afternoon where the couple were working on crafting a wand out of fallen wood. \"He had cut the wood for his wife, though she had chosen the wood herself because she had an interest in making her own wand. Watching them work\u2014I was instantly curious. I immediately wanted to try making my own [wand].\" Hampton had found the incorporation of wood in her artwork intriguing since she was a child. She would paint on the backs of found wooden objects, such as the back of a mirror, then incorporate those two-dimensional paintings into a table or an item that was more three-dimensional in finality. She was always, conceptually or physically, working between the two worlds. Paula Hampton knew, at age five, that there was something magical about art. \"If you are wanting to, in any way, shape, or form, move energy in your life, a wand is a powerful tool for that intention.\" Making Your Own MagicMagicMaking Your Own \"It was a combination of watching her make her own wand and seeing what her husband could do with carving and the textural elements of the wood that got me curious. Even when he wasn't at work, Ken would still always have something in his hands that he was working on. And I used to just watch him carve on pieces sometimes,\" said Hampton. It was not until the Harry Potter craze during the early 2000's, when wand woodworking would levitate its way into Hampton's creative brain once more. After attending a Halloween party dressed as a Hogwart's character, Hampton put her artistic talents back to work, crafting a wizard wand for her costume. Soon, her nephews took notice of the special piece, and it wasn't long before Hampton had family members calling upon her for a wand of their own. \"That's when I knew I had something really special here,\" said Hampton.Coincidentally, Hampton's career at AT&T was coming to a close around the same time. A new door was opening up, and, as if by a flick of a wand, the energy in Hampton's life was unexpectedly moving. Thus began Hampton's exploration in taking her wands wholesale to metaphysical stores and events such as Artes & Crafts in Hartford, and ConVocation in Dearborn. Hampton sold her handmade, one-of-a-kind wands from around 2004 up until 2017 through these outlets until she decided she wanted to scale back, get off the road, and sell more locally. Currently, Hampton is selling wands at Evenstar's Chalice in Ypsilanti. \"If you are wanting to, in any way, shape, or form, move energy in your life, a wand is a powerful tool for that intention,\" said Hampton. \"Many pagans and energy workers use my wands for this purpose. But kids love them, too, and parents love to buy my wands for the purpose of gift giving as well.\" For Hampton, the wand making process begins when Mother Nature decides.\"I do not purchase wood,\" said Hampton. \"All my wands are made entirely by hand, without the use of electric tools, except for a wood burner which I use to etch designs into the wands.\" This means that when a storm hits, Hampton is searching the woods of Ypsilanti and the surrounding area for felled wood such as birch, ash, and willow--whatever Mother Nature has in store. Or, Hampton sources wood from friends. Every branch she finds, Hampton takes to her barn to dry out in barrels. The wands stay that way for at least a year before she begins to work on them. This way, the moisture is out of the wood completely, and any splits or cracks in the bark are evident. Hampton works in cycles of the moon. Beginning a new batch of wands happens in the waning cycle, \"because the wood is dead. The way I see it, it's being resurrected into its next life as a working tool. During the waning phase, I'm cleaning off the cambium of the bark, [the part of the bark responsible for root and stem growth] and I sand the wands to get them nice and smooth.\" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 77 When Hampton's father passed, he left her boxes of amethyst and crystal tips, souvenirs of his \"amateur rockhound days\" sleuthing around the Upper Peninsula for gemstones. The incorporation of gemstones into her wooden wands felt like kismet to Hampton. \"Dad had seven kids. He worked full-time for Ford Motors, but he loved being around us when he was home. He would go out to quarries pretty frequently. There was always that week of being off at Ford, the week when there would be a changeover, and he would put all of his kids in the car and we'd go up to Grand Marais looking for Lake Superior agate, or we'd go to Petoskey and search for Petoskey stones... he had all of the jewelry making equipment in the basement: Tumblers. Tools for slicing. I had everything I needed. Almost everything I used [initially for the wands] was from his collection until probably about five or six years after he passed. Then I started going to rock shops. Sourcing materials for the wands ethically has always been important to me.\" Hampton said she's created between 1,200 - 1,500 wands since she began in 2004. \"My wands are playfully healing,\" said Hampton. \"They allow you to play, but they also help you heal your own inner desires.\" And just like in the Harry Potter series, Hampton reiterated, \"...the wand has a way of choosing the person. I've held onto wands for years, waiting for the right person to pick them up. Whatever combination of wood and crystals I've used, will draw the person best suited to work with that wand.\" During the final selection of a wand, Hampton said the tool should feel like part of the person holding it\u2014like an extension of the limb. Hampton recalls a time when a young man walked up to her booth. \"He must have picked up nearly every wand I had displayed,\" she recalled. \"I watched the gears turning in his head. He finally settled on two wands both made of white oak, but one had the Celtic infinity sign, where the other had symbols for financial success. I asked, 'what are you using the wand for?' he answered, 'I want to ask a girl to marry me. She's special to me but I'm not sure I'm special to her.'\" Hampton told the man to choose the wand with infinity knots, because \"you are asking for the energy of the infinite universe to work in your favor.\" Months later, in the summertime, the man came back to Hampton's booth, walking hand-in-hand with a beautiful blonde woman. \"I could tell, by the look on his face, that it had worked,\" Hampton said. \"He came up to me and said, 'I had to come back and let you know how you worked out in our story.' The wand gave him that boost of confidence that he needed to ask her the question. Customer satisfaction stories like that are my favorite.\" While Hampton hopes to one day get her hands on some ginkgo wood, or black willow, she is happy to craft her wands out of whatever nature provides. \"I've always known that if I ever lose my sense of that five-year-old wonder in myself, that part of myself who gets filled with wonderment and curiosity, that sense of wanting to observe and learn something more, that's when I've got one foot in the grave. That's what keeps me motivated, creatively. That's what keeps my spirit alive.\" \"I've held onto wands for years, waiting for the right person to pick them up. Whatever combination of wood and crystals I've used, will draw the person best suited to work with that wand.\" WALK-INS WELCOME for Readings & Healings Wednesday - Saturday 12:00 to 7:00 p.m. The Great Lakes are a precious gift and soon water will be sought everywhere. This story presents a strong message about the protection of water through the eyes of a young girl. She learns about the special gifts and responsibilities given to all living things. What is the sacred gift given to humans? What is the meaning of passing the feather in Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 78 The bright service-blue sign simply stating \"labyrinth\" caught my attention as I was driving by St. Barnabus in Chelsea, MI. It was on my literal path, thus destined to be part of my journey that day. Suffice it to say at the start of our walk together in this article, when I stood at the entrance of this 11 circuit, 40 foot labyrinth, I felt a mystical buzz. I was about to embark on a new spiritual entry point. The design's energy resonance blurred the already-low hum of vehicles passing by on Old-US 12. The energy seemed to pulse against the surrounding trees and flow back to me. I hesitated stepping into the labyrinth. Was there anything I needed to know about how to take this type of walk? I took a breath and like always, trusted to be led to what I was ready to learn at this time. Then, I stepped in. I invite you now to walk through several literary circuits of knowledge I gained exploring labyrinths in southeastern Michigan. Ever since my Moving Meditation article in Issue #79 of The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal , I knew I wanted to explore walking meditations. From walking or dancing in a clockwise fashion (either around a fire or statue or sacred rock) to walking miles for a pilgrimage or penance, the full body pacing of one's self has been used for thousands of years to connect with, and divine from, Spirit. However, when I first began mentioning I was visiting local labyrinths, people began making allusions to the Greco-Roman minotaur's lair, David Bowie in the movie Labyrinth, and JK Rowling's book Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. These stories show choices infused with dire consequences along convoluted tunnels of either towering shrub-lined walls or stone carved caverns. Though the words \"maze\" and \"labyrinth\" have, at times, been used interchangeably, a clear distinction can be seen when comparing the terms' etymologies and historical remains. Our Outer Circuit: History \"Maze\" is traced to Middle English and suggests delirium or delusion\u2014possibly a truncation of \"amaze.\" \"Labyrinth\" can be traced to the Greek term labyrinthos which is a large building with intricate passages\u2014not necessarily with misleading choices or dead ends. Similarly, per Doctor Julie E. Bounford's The Curious History of By Michelle McLemore It was on my literal path, thus destined to be part of my journey that day. Saint Barnabus Episcopal Church, Chelsea, Michigan From walking or dancing in a clockwise fashion (either around a fire or statue or sacred rock) to walking miles for a pilgrimage or penance, the full body pacing of one's self has been used for thousands of years to connect with, and divine from, Spirit. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 79 Mazes, the Greek word for the nautilus shell, for example, is laburinthoi. The nautilus shell reflects the Sacred Geometry principles of the Fibonacci Sequence and the spiral pattern of growth to perfection as (and when) it is needed\u2014spiraling in and out of itself. Though labyrinths may be square, oval, circular, and even random shapes, the oldest are oval and have been found in northwest Spain, carved in rock. The theory is they may have been traced with one's finger or eyes. Additional ancient labyrinths have been found on pottery, Roman floor mosaics, coins, the Nazca desert in Peru, and even tablets the world over. At some point, Christian institutions began designing them as part of their complexes\u2014either as outside gardens or indoor floor designs. It is believed they were used as a safe, cost-effective alternative to traveling to Holy sites on a full pilgrimage. The oldest Christian labyrinth is in the Basilica of Resparatus at Orleonsville, Algeria and is estimated to be from 324 CE. One of the most walked\u2014and most emulated\u2014medieval labyrinths is at Chartres Cathedral in France, dating circa 1205. The pattern can still be walked today by visitors. The First Turn: Circuit 2 Labyrinth construction is classified by shape, center design, and if a second path is present for a quick exit after reaching the center. Each type has \"circuits\" or one path that turns back and forth on itself before reaching the center. Classical style is circular in design with no central circle.Jericho-style from ninth century Italy is square with no central resting area. Concentric circular patterns range from five to eleven paths with a center circular area. Medieval style has a six-rosette center design with its path divided into four quadrants similar to the Native American medicine wheel. Battle Axes or horn-type turn-abouts separate the quadrants. Teeth, or jagged edging, face outward from the outer-most circle. The Baltic design has the long entrance and a secondary quick exit path, believed to assist ceremonial processions. Of the eighteen outdoor labyrinths I visited from March to June 2022, the Medieval style was the most commonly installed. I chose to focus on outdoor installations, but it is fun to note, there are numerous indoor labyrinths across Michigan as well as wall labyrinths, carpet labyrinths rolled out for special occasions, and labyrinths printed on paper to be followed with a finger for convenience. Turn Three Back at the entrance to the St. Barnabus Labyrinth (which came to be one of my favorites), I had missed the handout informing me of the three phases to a labyrinth walk: entering, centering, and exiting. The entrance and first half of the walk is dedicated to leaving the physical, daily \"real\" life to retreat into one's Self and the spiritual realm. By the time one reaches the center (where you may rest or dwell in contemplation) it is a typical experience to receive insight from your higher Self or Divine guidance. The third phase is walking the circuit back out the way you came in to integrate any insight gained and to prepare to re-enter the daily life more empowered. Had my experience been limited by not knowing what to expect or these phases? No, because my intention had been simply to be open to receive, to take the time to breathe, be mindful, and try to go with the flow. Reading the pamphlet afterward simply clarified what I had experienced. Fourth Ring and Forthwith Hesitation The first two observations while walking my first labyrinth, was that I had to slow my pace. Dizziness from looking down and tightness of turns depend upon the diameter of the full design, the number of circuits in the design, and the width of the actual path (which I came to discover ranged from one foot to riding lawnmower width). Okay. Breathe. Slow the pace and breath. It isn't about getting to a destination quickly. It is about the walk. The comfort in walking the design is knowing you don't have to think about where to go. Each path is outlined\u2014with brick pavers, wildflowers, grass, something. And that is another purposeful part of the design. A walk into a labyrinth is about yielding up conscious control. There is a comfort for your brain to let the borders in your peripheral vision guide your steps while the eyes watch for the turns. The combination provides the balance of easing out of the strain of directing your physical body and turning into yourself with each turn into a new circuit. Curiously, somewhere just past the half-way mark of my journey to the center, in almost every labyrinth I walked, I was suddenly pulled out of the nearing meditative daze with a sudden almost panic: Had I stepped off the path? Had I messed up the journey? Breathe. Let it go. Just continue. I did. And it did. Every time. Almost immediately I fell back into the comfort of the protected dimension of discovery. As I stepped into circuits closer to the center, a question or situation usually surfaced\u2014different than the common daily buzzing thoughts that had entered the pattern with me. And usually, as soon as the question clarified, I would find myself at the center of the labyrinth with an answer. St. Joseph's Mercy Hospital Ypsilanti, Michigan \"Labyrinth\" can be traced to the Greek term labyrinthos which is a large building with intricate passages\u2014not necessarily with misleading choices or dead ends. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 80 Reaching the Center and Culminating Insights With my first few labyrinths, facing the center would cause an intake of breath and brief hesitancy\u2014similar to what I felt before stepping into the first circuit at the beginning. As my experiences and visits to more labyrinths unfolded, reaching a center evolved into a release of joy and child-like energy. Visiting the perennial wildflower five-circuit labyrinth at SoulDig LLC in Jackson, MI, I looked back briefly at my sister Susan, along for her first experience, and then I jumped into the center with both feet...and giggled out loud. For a brief moment, we were young children again\u2014barefooted, tangled-hair in the sunshine. Then, I stepped further into the center circle to make room for her to arrive in her own time. At each labyrinth, I presented myself humbly, open to whatever insights or experiences I would be led to, trusting in Divine protection and wisdom. Without fail, each experience led to different insights. I'd like to share a few appropriate for wider audiences. Your Walk is Your Business.I talked my husband into a day date at Matthei Botanical Gardens in Ann Arbor. After a hike across the fields, past a pond, and a wildflower garden, we drew up to the labyrinth and he asked, \"Are you going to walk it?\" \"Absolutely. That's the point!\" I responded cheerfully. He took off. I bit my lip smiling at his speed, reminding myself we all \"walk\" a different journey. The path being barely 12\" of crushed stone, it was inevitable that we would pass several times. We did a high five each time his return loop came by my forward loop. (Be aware, this is not necessarily appropriate etiquette for all labyrinth situations. Most would suggest if you meet someone at the same point of the same circuit, one person simply steps aside to allow the other to continue. More serious environments would discourage any distractions of others in their meditation.) In the center, we sat on the two large rocks for a few breaths listening to the giggles carried on the wind of other park visitors in the woods beyond. I found myself pondering: How do we each walk our paths? What does our chosen pacing reveal? What is our purpose per walk? We can guess answers regarding others' and yet, then came the insight: It is none of our business. Our walk (physical, emotional, spiritual) is our own business. Similarly, you may have seen the meme, \"What others think of me is none of my business.\" Remind yourself as often as you need that it works both ways. Soul Dig Jackson, Michigan By the time one reaches the center (where you may rest or dwell in contemplation) it is a typical experience to receive insight from your higher Self or Divine guidance. Curiously, somewhere just past the half-way mark of my journey to the center, in almost every labyrinth I walked, I was suddenly pulled out of the nearing meditative daze with a sudden almost panic: Had I stepped off the path? Had I messed up the journey? Continued from previous page Lori Tate, OwnerThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 81 You will arrive. Regardless. To the right of the main entrance from parking lot B at Ypsilanti's Saint Joseph's Hospital, is a sign directing visitors to the labyrinth. Tucked into an alley, nestled under small trees, the stone and paver 28 foot Medieval, 11 circuit design was surprisingly compelling. Stepping into the labyrinth was like walking into a bubble of calm, despite the fear and apprehension breathed daily into the rooms of the surrounding hospital wings. Within a few moments of that thought and entering the labyrinth, a text message came in from Roxane Chan, a holistic nurse who installed a 45 foot, medieval seven-circuit labyrinth on plush grass outlined by pavers. The design was installed in the side yard of her home in Saline alongside a traditional bell to ring before and after using a labyrinth. Chan was checking in from a nurses' conference where she was about to participate in the dedication of a labyrinth to all the nurses lost during the Covid-19 pandemic. Timing. Wherever we are, we are connected in experience and energy. Pulling back to my immediate locale, I walked the hospital's one-foot-wide path and noted moss and tree debris were encroaching upon the outer circuit. I found myself mulling over what happens when someone's path is blocked out or obscured? In those less-clear moments, we acknowledge the situation. We try to look as far as we can down the road to decipher the path, but we have to continue on regardless. As I came to the rosette center, a breeze came up and sunlight shone through, coinciding with the thought\u2014You did arrive. You will arrive. Sometime. Somehow. Like GPS recalculating, if we encounter a roadblock, or challenge and must reroute, we still end up at a destination. Fear less...fearless. The former Saint Joseph's Hospital in Saline yielded similar thoughts. Just north of the utility shed by the old professional building (now a Montessori school), this abandoned labyrinth felt like I was discovering an archaeological treasure. Two young groundhogs were watching with interest as I walked toward the fieldstone. I chuckled to see a squirrel stretched out sunning itself on an overturned bench. The entrance to the 40-foot Medieval field stone design was blocked by a large burdock plant. I squeezed around it and continued. The use of heavier stones as the borders produced a grounding, mythical feel. And coming up on the nettle, prickers, and other wild plants creeping in somehow seemed appropriate in this rustic setting. (Though part of me at the same time wished I had brought my trowel and gloves so I could start clearing it.) How do we react when we encounter roadblocks? Do we give up? Do we step aside? Do we work to remove the block? Do we look for meaning in the moment? We carry on and we arrive. Faltering Walks Can Still Be Trusted.At the entrance of the Manresa Jesuit Retreat labyrinth, I paused and actually whispered, \"Wow!\" I took a deep breath and was delighted to feel the energy of the design actually pull my body forward and in. Mary Gresens, the main patron, has been involved at Manresa for over a decade on the Board of Directors, a graduate of its Spiritual Companions in the Ignatian tradition program, and as a Christian yoga instructor. The labyrinth was a three-year project, installed, blessed, and inaugurated in the summer of 2015. Gresens shared, \"It is based on the eleven-circuit design at Chartres Cathedral in France, but with a diameter of 62 feet it is almost 50% wider.\" A 62-foot labyrinth is impressive...visually Triple Crane Monastery is now TripleCraneRetreat.org | 7665 Chelsea MI 48118 Office@TripleCraneRetreat.org | 734.713.6163Donations gratefully acceptedRetreat and workshop space available.

Without fail, each experience led to different insights. Nativity Episcopal Church Bloomfield Township, Michigan The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 82 complex. My vision seemed to waver like a heat distortion as I stood at the entrance looking across the circuits weaving back and forth. Standing at its entrance, I could feel tears of emotion begin to well up. So many people had walked here in gratitude, concern, hope, grief\u2014all trusting answers and guidance would come. The two-foot diameter path underneath was subtle brown and gray stone. There were purposely no benches placed around the exterior to ensure no one sat and talked which might disturb a walker. What does each person want when they walk the path? Peace, clarity, forgiveness? Directive? Ironically, a labyrinth leads inward and, in every direction, geographically, mentally, and spiritually. Had I expected this labyrinth to provide the pinnacle of insight for this article? Is that why I saved it for nearly last? It would seem there are many expectations of religious sites throughout history. We, the people, laden them with pressure and a demand to perform... perhaps unfairly. Do we place as much demand and expectation upon ourselves\u2014our own spiritual relationship with the Divine? If not, why not? At that thought, my physical balance faltered. Ah. Because we struggle with spiritual balance and consistency? Is that our \"excuse\"? Suddenly, I pulled up. How had I arrived at the center already? Because it was time. It served as an exclamation point. Despite when, and how often we may falter, it is still the individual's responsibility to cultivate the relationship with the Divine\u2014to ask questions, to explore the nature of Nature, to listen for insight whispered on the breeze or directed to our minds. The Return Path Leaving the center, the return path usually feels quicker, though just as much processing and integration is occurring. I would caution that if one skips winding back through the circuits, you should do a brief grounding meditation or sit a few moments before driving. The labyrinth which yielded the most powerful return for me was in Jackson. Owner, designer, and maintainer Dr. Lori Tate is a spiritual life coach/spiritual director who invites everyone to walk her community-focused labyrinth next to the Northern entrance of the Dahlia Conservation Center. With a Judeo-Christian background, Tate enjoys \"helping people listen, notice, and discern what it is like hearing the Holy Spirit.\" The current labyrinth, open to the public, is \"version 3.0.\" Tate chuckled. The first was an 11-circuit field stone-edging grass walk in a medieval style. Version 2.0 saw her expand the paths to lawn mower width for ease of maintenance. Version 3.0 was a dramatic revision removing the stones and reworking it to a five-circuit path, a riding lawn mower-width plush grass path with borders of perennials donated, purchased, and lovingly transplanted. A Walk Within and Beyond ~ Labyrinths Lead the Way Continued from previous page Manresa Jesuit Retreat House Bloomfield Hills, Michigan Stepping into the labyrinth was like walking into a bubble of calm, despite the fear and apprehension breathed daily into the rooms of the surrounding hospital wings. My vision seemed to waver like a heat distortion as I stood at the entrance looking across the circuits weaving back and forth. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 83 Wild yarrow, iris, milkweed, allium, lambs' ear, lavender, along with other plants line the walk, promising a continuous changing experience of blooms. On my June visit, we had just missed the center's brilliant kick off encircling the visitors with daffodils. My sister, Susan and I discussed how the nature infusion supported this particular walk. There was space to breathe as the walk didn't make us feel confined by a tight structure. The mind was able to flow, and we were able to thoroughly immerse ourselves joyfully, appreciatively, in the diversity of the nature surrounding and guiding the steps. As I exited the labyrinth emotion welled up. Tears gently released as I hesitantly stepped out. Love. Joy. Gratitude. I could feel the love that had been\u2014and was\u2014 continuously intentionalized into this work of living art by its host. Manresa, Every Woman's Church, St. Barnabus, and Nativity Episcopal labyrinths all exuded similar energy. Works, such as these, will continue to be a spiritual gift and require physical maintenance. So, at each, I said a quiet prayer: Bless this home, this park, its purpose, and the work. Peace. It is done. It is done. It is done. In a sense, labyrinths invite us in\u2014into ourselves, where our past, potential future, and always present Self exists for a moment to breathe, talk to ourselves, and be in the eternal space inside \"reality\" and yet outside of it at the same moment. Stepping out Every labyrinth experience wasn't soul-shaking yet did offer something to ponder. I chose my sites from the World-Wide Labyrinth Locater online and 18 was as many in Southeastern Michigan as I could visit before my deadline. There are actually many more in the area and across the state. As I would discover, investing in a labyrinth is a long-term commitment (like raising children), and some organizations don't have the stamina to maintain them. Also, most I did not find to be wheelchair nor walker accessible due to narrow paths or uneven walking stones. Be sure to call before driving a long distance as some advertised labyrinths were under water or in varying stages of being overtaken by nature. A few were installed by well-meaning people with minimal skill (or perhaps care?) in executing the symmetry reminiscent of childhood chalk-drawn fantasies. If I found myself comparing designs too critically, I chided myself to remember each has its own design, purpose, and goal along with influences. What were the resources available? Who donated their time and effort to bring it to fruition? What caused the developers to part ways and have to entrust the care to someone who may not have even been around at the time of installation? Each is a work of art. Each installation is a beautiful journey in its own rite. I met some lovely people\u2014designers, caregivers, and walkers of these mystical paths. There are many more stories I could share. Still, you should walk your own path and see what experiences are brought to you on your own walk, in your own time. Michelle McLemore is an energy and stress-management therapist who also does freelance writing. The full specifics of McLemore's first labyrinth experience at St. Barnabus in Chelsea, MI can be found in The Crazy Wisdom Bi-Weekly, issue 87, \"Out of the Maze and Deeper Into the Path.\" Read about some other experiences on her blog at michellemclemore.com.

Since I was a child, I have felt God's presence and remember having Divine unitive experiences of awe of my existence and God's creation. I attended an all-girls school and thought I was going to be a nun. However, my vocation to be a mother was stronger and I was married young and had four daughters and a son. Raising them full time was a very fulfilling and holy experience for me. When my children left for college, my hands were empty, but my energy was very strong. It was a time to recreate myself. Coincidentally, my only sister and best friend Marta, died suddenly at the age of 38. In my profound grief I realized that I needed to create. More than the activities in the garden, more than my creations in the kitchen. Creativity was calling me to heal my soul. A t the same time, I felt I needed to rediscover God, so I enrolled at the Shalem Institute for Spiritual Formation where I earned several degrees and became a Spiritual Director and Group Formation Leader. It took me ten years, some of the best of my life. In Shalem, which is Ecumenical, I had the gift of sharing time and studies with people from different religions. It was a time of searching; I visited several temples, churches, and synagogues as my soul was so ready to soak in the many faiths that enriched mine. I discovered Rumi and Hazif. I studied with Rossi Joan Halifax and attended Mystery school with Jean Houston for a year. My soul was soaring, renewed, and refreshed.

I have no words to describe my emotion and gratitude. When his Holiness greeted me personally, my heart swelled in his loving presence. Pope Francis told me he liked the piece, and after giving me a hug, as we Argentinians do, he said \"Thank you for making me smile.\" I am f orever grateful for the grace of this gift. Never would I have imagined that my sculpture would be at The Vatican, in Pope Francis' collection. You can visit Estela Monjo Boudreau's virtual art gallery at galeriamariposa.net. To learn about the Windrise Retreat Center visit windrise.com.Following graduation, I created Women's prayer groups in my eagerness to share my discoveries. During this time, I also discovered an interest in sculpture, and it has been one of my greatest gifts from God. My sculptures have been expressions of grief, healing, realizations, discoveries, and longings. Creating these pieces brought a tremendous amount of empowerment, courage, and lots of joy. As my sculpting skills grew, I created classes for beginners and advanced students to share the healing I had received through creating art. In 1996, I founded the Windrise Retreat Center in Metamora, Michigan. For almost 30 years we have held retreats of many kinds. My husband Greg and I host people who find peace and serenity in a secluded 100-acre estate surrounded by forest and a softly singing river. We are Ecumenical in spirit\u2014all denominations are welcome at Windrise. Now I mainly host sculpture classes at my Windrise studio, Galeria Mariposa, as my way to explore the soul. In March 2013, Pope Francis was elected. The fact that he is Argentinian, as I am, and the first Jesuit and Latin American to be ordained brought tears of joy. He chose his name, Francis, to honor his spiritual connection with St. Francis of Assisi who cared for the poor and the underprivileged. He lives in a simple apartment in the Vatican and refuses the Papal palace and all the luxurious apparel. At night he wears simple Priest clothes as a disguise and visits the homeless. We can say he is like Christ, revolutionary (bringing changes where needed), humble, compassionate, and very wise. When he appeared on the balcony after his ordination at Piazza St. Peter, his first words were \"Pray for me.\" I cried as I experienced the humility in his words. It was those three words that inspired me to start working on a bust of him\u2014the work took a few months. Aft er two years of applying for an audience to gift the Pope with my sculpture, I was finally accepted for an audience on March 18, 2020. Just as my husband and I were ready to embark on this holy and extraordinary trip, Italy closed, and the Covid-19 pandemic crushed our plans. The Vatican coordinator for my audience with the Pope assured me that I would be first in line for an audience when the Vatican opened back up. So, as I surrendered to God's plans, I spent the Covid quarantine time sculpting portraits of other people I admire like Ruth Bader Ginsberg. In the summer of 2021, the Vatican scheduled another audience. With great excitement, we flew to Rome on the 5th of October for an audience with Pope Francis on the 6th. The bust was professionally packed, and we carried it to Rome with our luggage on Lufthansa Airlines. I had visited Rome and the Vatican several times since Pope Francis was ordained. During one visit I saw him in the balcony\u2014it was an unexpected surprise\u2014but it gave me the chance to take the photo I used to create his bust. The St. Peters Basilica has always made me marvel at its gilded beauty\u2014from Michelangelo's magnificent sculpture of The Piet\u00e0, to all the beautiful art adorning its walls. Being a sculptor, I have always been touched and inspired by my visits. This visit was different, though. The audience was held in a large auditorium in the In March 2013, Pope Francis was elected. The fact that he is Argentinian, as I am, and the first Jesuit and Latin American to be ordained brought tears of joy.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 88 Astrologically SpeakingAstrologically Speaking Beyond the Shadow\u2014Eclipses in T aurus & Scorpio Often the eclipses are partial and not observable, either because of our location, time of day, or cloud cover. Even if eclipses are not visible astronomically, they still have an effect astrologically. Eclipses are said to bring about great beginnings and great endings, but not every eclipse will be significant to you personally. The Solar and Lunar Eclipses of 2022 & 2023 By Catherine Carlson This fall season we will experience two eclipses: The first will be a partial solar eclipse on October 25th in the sign of Scorpio, followed by a total lunar eclipse on November 8th in the sign of Taurus. When we speak of eclipses, we might immediately imagine a total solar eclipse, such as the one in August of 2017. While that was a rare event to witness, both solar and lunar eclipses occur regularly in pairs roughly every six months. Occasionally there may be a third eclipse in a series. Often the eclipses are partial and not observable, either because of our location, time of day, or cloud cover. Even if eclipses are not visible astronomically, they still have an effect astrologically. To \"eclipse\" by definition means the total or partial obscuring of one celestial body by another, or to pass into the shadow of a celestial body. \"Eclipse\" generally speaking, means to obscure or darken. A solar eclipse occurs when a new moon passes between the sun and the earth. This can be a time of new beginnings. A lunar eclipse happens when the earth passes between the sun and a full moon. This can represent the completion of something. Eclipses happen due to the position of the north and south nodes of the moon. These are points where the moon's orbit intersects with the orbit of the sun.The lunar eclipse occurring on November 8th in the sign of Taurus has added significance in the United States because that happens to be election day. If that's not enough to make you take notice, the planet Uranus, known for surprises, is lining up with the eclipse at that exact same time as well. While nothing may actually happen on that day, I would expect the energy of the eclipse to reflect what is happening in our nation in a significant way. Eclipses typically occur between polar opposite astrological signs and they ping-pong between the two every six months for a duration of eighteen months to two years. The exception is when the polarity-point shifts for one sign before the other. For example, last November the Taurus eclipse series began while the previous eclipse series was still finishing out in the sign of Sagittarius. Eclipses are said to bring about great beginnings and great endings, but not every eclipse will be significant to you personally. It all depends on where the planets fall in your birth chart. If your sun is in the signs of either Taurus or Scorpio, the current sets of eclipses are likely to have a big effect on you. It's also worth noting that if an eclipse falls on or within days of your birthday, it's a sign to pay attention to your health. T aurus & Scorpio Taurus and Scorpio are opposite signs, six months apart, with a common thread. Taurus is an earth sign and represents mother nature and the material world. It has to do with what we value every day for our survival or what is worthy to us, such as basic needs like finances, food, and resources. It also reflects our self-worth, as well as beauty, since it is ruled by the planet Venus. The eclipses in Taurus indicates possible changes in these areas. While Taurus signifies basic survival, water sign Scorpio, on the opposite end of the spectrum, can represent survival against difficult odds with the potential for regeneration. Mars, Scorpio's traditional ruler and the opposite of Venus, gives us the drive and energy for such tasks. Scorpio also has to do with finances that are not our own and what we value at a deeper level. The solar eclipse occurring on October 25th aligns perfectly with the energy of Halloween, All Saints Day, All Souls Day, and Day of the Dead\u2014all holidays that fall in the week to follow. A perfect and powerful example of the Taurus-Scorpio eclipse energies playing out is the unprecedented rainfall and severe flooding Yellowstone National Park experienced within a month following the spring eclipses. Mother Nature produced an event that was historic, unexpected, and challenging, but all was not lost. Here lies the opportunity for survival in spite of a setback and an opportunity for transformation. Within a few weeks, the park was already re-opening in certain areas. Talking about what's happening in your life or hearing from others can illuminate how eclipses might affect people. A friend with her sun in the sign of Taurus ended up having major surgery in the weeks following the first eclipse in Taurus in November of 2021. The positive outcome of this was a previously unknown cancerous tumor was removed and she required no further treatment. This initiated a new path to health for her. Another friend with her sun in the sign of Scorpio made plans to move from Michigan, where she has lived for many years, to Tennessee during the pair of eclipses this past spring. It's something she had been planning to do eventually but the timing was finally right. For her this represented both a great ending of a chapter of her life and a great beginning in her new location. Eclipses cycle through the zodiac in reverse order and repeat in opposite nodes, but in the same signs every nine years or so. They also repeat with mathematical accuracy down to the degree and day every 19 years. An easy way for someone to see how the current eclipse series will affect them is to simply subtract 19 years from the present and reflect back on that year or time period. That would be the last time the current series would have passed and you may notice a theme.

Eclipses in Utero Another fascinating aspect of eclipses that is not often discussed are the eclipses we experience before we are born. The book Spiritual Astrology by the late Jan Spiller and Karen McCoy examines the eclipses experienced by all of us pre-natal. The solar eclipse sign signifies the lessons a person has come here to teach others and the lunar eclipse sign indicates what lessons are necessary for continued soul growth. Children yet to be born that experience Taurus and Scorpio eclipses will have the gift of showing the world the rightful use of power and energy for tremendous healing. The lessons will be around themes of spiritual principles, personal boundaries, as well as achieving material wealth through spiritual means and measuring self-worth in a new way. Aft er this current round of Taurus-Scorpio eclipses, the moon's nodes shift into Aries and Libra which will highlight our individuality and relationships. There will be one last lunar eclipse in Scorpio next spring and one final lunar eclipse in Taurus in October of 2023. Eclipses are dramatic and captivating to watch and they can reflect equally dramatic life events. The effects of eclipses can begin in the months beforehand and last up to 18 months following. Astrologer Chris Brennan of The Astrology Podcast says, \"Eclipses always act as catalysts for change and change sometimes can be good or more challenging. But the primary idea is to keep in mind they are catalysts for change in [a certain] area of your life.\" It's not easy to foresee what the change is going to look like because the light, which shows us what we can see, is always obscured in an eclipse. Once the light is no longer blocked, we may be surprised at what is revealed.

Crazy Wisdom KidsCrazy Wisdom Kids An ongoing section of The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal Articles, calendar listings, advertisements, music and book reviews, and other features that focus on raising conscious and spirited kids.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 90 By Christine MacIntyre Dr. Joshua Coleman visits a subject of vulnerability and sensitivity in nature in Rules of Estrangement: Why Adult Children Cut Ties & How to Heal the Conflict. His expertise as a trusted psychologist and his personal experience with the silent epidemic known as estrangement guide readers through this compelling book. While popular opinion typically sways to one side, favoring the estranged child, Dr. Coleman looks at each situation through an objective lens carefully drawing information from all sides. He touches on what estrangement looks like, how it might happen, coping strategies, and helpful information on reconciliation and healing. Gentle and sympathetic to both concerned parties, he offers professional and factual, evidence-based material for the reader wishing to dig deeper into the topic of estrangement. Through compassionate verbiage and thorough explanations, Dr. Coleman provides insights deeper than the typical one-sided story commonly told on this topic. Estrangement is a seemingly complex phenomenon in terms of the underpinnings and emotional turmoil it causes. As a result, the issue may feel intimidating to some, especially those living through it. However, Dr. Coleman's well-thought-out narrative gives readers a sense of reassurance\u2014they are not alone, it is not necessarily a lost cause, and help is available. The introduction hits the nail on the head\u2014that estrangement is not commonly discussed with anyone, including family, friends, or coworkers, for fear of being judged. Dr. Coleman ensures readers throughout the introduction and the entire book that estrangement doesn't always equate to bad parents, bad people, or worst-case scenarios. However, he doesn't discount it as something minute; instead, he says dealing with it is \"no small task\" and even dubs it \"the most painful experience\" he's ever been through in his own life. Interspersing his book with both his own experience and clinical experience, as well as enriching it with the voices of parents with whom he's worked, Dr. Coleman starts by making no assumptions about either parties' innocence or guilt. While the book is seemingly intended for parents or grandparents suffering from a lost relationship with an adult child or grandchild, adult children also have something to gain. The painful and confusing topics discussed throughout the pages are eye-opening for anyone who reads them and shines a light on new perspectives to consider. From chapter one, Dr. Coleman maintains a realistic outlook for readers. A commonly asked question is, \"Can I save the relationship...?\" Case studies provide examples of real adult children and parents struggling with estrangement and explain how Dr. Coleman tried to assist them in reconciliation. Demonstrating his compassion and eagerness to help others, he evaluates the situation to gain an intelligible understanding of the parties involved, including their personalities, strengths, vulnerabilities, level of insight, sensitivity, and self-reflection. Additionally, he looks at generational traps and unhealthy patterns, determining how these shaped or negatively impacted the parent-child relationship and how they might influence reconciliation. The examples show readers that a parent's responses to professional recommendations, especially those involving \"[empathizing] with the child's complaints or perceptions, however at odds these are with their own,\" may be crucial. The case studies show that \"the chance for a reconciliation hinged on the parent's capacity to dig deep, empathize, and make amends for the ways that their child had felt neglected, hurt, or abused.\" Dr. Coleman then provides the tools needed to transform these problematic dynamics by teaching parents a new language and the requirements of parents and adult children to have a close relationship. Estrangement is a seemingly complex phenomenon in terms of the underpinnings and emotional turmoil it causes. As a result, the issue may feel intimidating to some, especially those living through it.Dr. Coleman unearths some of the reasons for unsuccessful reconciliation, looking at various factors that inhibit success and how \"estrangements reflect a broader cultural transformation\" compared to several decades ago. The bulk of the chapters provides insights into the underpinnings of estrangement, including abuse, mental illness, divorce, differing opinions, and differences in values and personalities. He posits that \"what is diagnosable, pathological, and traumatizing now encompasses so much of what should be considered normal, expectable parenting.\" Dr. Coleman adequately explains how this expansion of grievances under the umbrella of mental disorders seemingly creates a problem for estrangement\u2014both the prevalence and its outcomes. Family turmoil isn't a new concept; however, readers understand how it has changed and how the changes lead to an increased risk of estrangement. Select chapters are dedicated to topics such as divorce, mental illness, and addiction and how these might play a role in the likelihood of estrangement and the potential for reconciliation. Looking at each factor with a magnifying glass, Dr. Coleman explains how these influence the terrain of estrangement. While these can feel like hopeless, impossible situations, his suggestions for ways of responding calmly, effectively, and fearlessly offer encouragement to propel forward. The contents of Rules of Estrangement illuminate the layers of emotional distress inherent to estrangement ranging from guilt, shame, and grief, to resentment. Cases are presented for modalities such as psychotherapy, offering lifelines for those who may need it most. The book continuously ensures readers that there is hope, even if reconciliation doesn't occur. Dr. Coleman maintains an optimistic tone throughout the text, without disregarding the possibility that pitfalls may be unavoidable. Through this tone, his work provides readers with hope, but not to the point of false promises. Dr. Coleman provides comprehensive strategies that make the process seem less hopeless. Readers will realize the importance of getting to the heart of the problem, identifying triggers and underlying issues, and learning how to respond in the face of obstacles. The detail in each chapter, including those explicitly dedicated to flashpoints such as personality clashes, politics, religion, in-laws, and sibling dynamics, is the perfect amount to avoid feeling overwhelmed with information. Dr. Coleman leaves no stone unturned with a chapter designated to abandoned grandparents and the weaponizing of grandchildren. Thousands of grandparent and grandchild relationships experience a cutting of ties. Dr. Coleman informs readers that it can sometimes result from a grandparent's problematic behavior; however, leaning on his clinical experience, he finds \"it more typically stems from a conflict between the parent and the adult child or the adult child's spouse.\" This chapter's inclusion is significant, as it seems essential to understanding how estrangement aggravates more than just the parent and child. Examining estranged grandparents and the double burden it places on them allows readers to understand each part of the intricate web of estrangement. Similarly, estrangement has the potential to uproot marriages and romantic relationships, as well. Dr. Coleman describes this potential and provides practical information for coping strategies, finding a new normal, and settling into a life with healthy boundaries. In conclusion, Rules of Estrangement holds valuable information revolving around the topic of estrangement. Dr. Coleman provides easy-to-follow explanations to help readers understand what it is, why it occurs, potential causes, and how to move forward. By acknowledging common myths about estrangement and giving merit to the perspectives of both adult children and their parents, the book feels like a complete guidebook or roadmap. Whether or not it results in reconciliation, the future sounds more manageable and optimistic after this read.Book Review Rules of EstrangementThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 91 By Christine MacIntyre Suzanne Simard, Finding the Mother Tree's author, takes readers on a journey through the course of Simard's life. She interlaces the pages with experiences from her personal and professional life, one gracefully intertwining with the other. An in-depth exploration of the natural world keeps readers engaged as they devour the pages in search of the next bit of wisdom Simard imparts. A quote by American marine biologist Rachel Carson, situated on the first few pages before the table of contents, sums it up perfectly: \"But man is a part of nature, and his war against nature is inevitably a war against himself.\" Throughout the chapters, Simard weaves a clear image for readers, vividly detailing the connections between humans and nature, nature and humans. Born and raised in British Columbia, her love of forestry shines through the narrative, which captures her connection to the forest and how that connection helped shape many aspects of her life. Readers follow alongside her as she ventures into the woods and dares to question that which she believes is wrong, challenging the conventional ways of forestry, work life, and feminism. The introduction\u2014which readers should not skip\u2014helps establish a sense of connection, as its name suggests. Speaking on generational patterns of \"cutting down forests\" and, in turn, the spiral of life and death, Simard gives readers a peek into what sparked her curiosity about the forest. \"Working to solve the mysteries of what made the forests tick, and how they are linked to the earth and fire and water, made me a scientist,\" she states. Simard's memories demonstrate how she connects nature, human life, and her mission to piece together the puzzle of healing the natural world. Her remarkable discoveries in nature and herself resulted from her curiosity and determination to learn. However, she acknowledges that what she grew up understanding was vastly different than what she came to know. From the realization of \"vast landscapes cleared of trees, soils stripped of nature's complexity, a persistent harshness of elements, communities devoid of old trees leaving the young ones vulnerable, and an industrial order that felt hugely, terribly misguided,\" a deep concern was born. This concern took root within Simard and spoke to her soul, prompting her to learn about the trees' \"perceptiveness and responsiveness, connections and conversations.\" What was once her childhood home, Western Canada, grew into something much bigger and extraordinary\u2014a personal transcendence in which she furnished her understanding and appreciation of the forest's intelligence and how to heal her relationship with nature. Throughout her journey, Simard reveals factual elements (such as scientific names of certain trees and fungi) and sheds light on the social nature of the forest and how it spurs evolution. One of the most shocking elements of her findings is the existence of a cryptic underground fungal network \"pervasive through the entire forest floor, connecting all the trees in a constellation of tree hubs and fungal links.\" She maps out how these connections have similarities with the human brain\u2014old and young showing traits such as perception, communication, and responsiveness to one another. The way older trees identify their kin and nurture the young with food and water\u2014like human adults nurturing their young\u2014led to Simard's discovery of Mother Trees. She identifies these as \"the majestic hubs at the center of forest communication, protection, and sentience,\" stating that once they pass on, they pass their wisdom on to their kin, enabling them to adapt and survive in the landscape in which they live. The introduction is a solid foundation for the rest of the book. Simard developed a framework through it\u2014an understanding of who, what, where, when, why, and even how. Each chapter expands on the next, answering the question, how can the forest save us? Relying heavily on scientific evidence through observations, extensive research, experiments, and studies, Simard becomes a forest detective and sleuth. Her creative explanations teach readers both simple and complex forest knowledge. For example, how do you determine a tree's age? Many people know that the tree's rings, when cut, will show its age; however, perhaps not as many know that thicker rings indicate years when there was ample rainfall. Thinner, almost invisible rings indicate a cooler summer, drought, or other stressors. Revealing a much deeper aspect of trees, Simard uses easy-to-follow language to describe the complex, scientific processes happening below the soil within the forests' roots. A recurring question she aims to resolve throughout the book is \"what roots and fungi had to do with the health of forests\u2014the harmony of things large and small, including concealed and overlooked elements.\" While the forest logistics she describes are intricate and complex, the way she conveys the knowledge to readers is neither mundane nor overly-scientific for the average person. Interspersed throughout her explanations are beautiful photographs of various elements in nature as well as some of herself and colleagues, family members, and friends. Some of these photos, such as the closeup of a pancake mushroom, or Suillus lakei, the detailed photo of ectomycorrhizal root tips with abundant emanating fungal hyphae, or the several photos revealing a plumage of emerald that resulted from the neural network beneath the soil, provide readers with a glimpse into aspects of nature they may ordinarily overlook. Moving through each phase of her life, the chapters of Simard's memoir reveal her progression in her findings about the forest and her personal life. Readers are given context for the ways in which her personal life and work-life developed seemingly parallel to the other. In many contexts, her work life development uncovered truths applicable to memoir age development. Her narrative unfolded, as well as answers in her work life, such as how fungal systems help maintain and even promote tree health. She refers to herself as \"different from the women of the town and the girls on the pinup calendar by the drafting tables [at work].\" Yet, she exhibits confidence and a sense of purpose, despite opposition and resistance, health issues, family grievances, failed experiments, and flawed policies. She forged relationships both at work and home, finding herself a meaningful landing place in both arenas, just as the mycorrhizal networks found on root tips do in the forest. Yet, as with everything, she finds herself navigating obstacles, such as a divorce, the woes common to women in a male-dominated workplace, and, eventually, a cancer diagnosis. However, Simard stays true to her heart, following nature's guidance and seeking solace in and through the forest. Based on her conviction that is working with rather than against nature, through maintaining its diversity as opposed to clear-cutting large areas or entire forests, Simard reveals the myriad synergistic benefits to every living thing and being. These include higher productivity, more wood, cleaner air, cleaner water, more homes for wildlife, and healthier forests. Simard's work as a leading forest ecologist and as the author of Finding the Mother Tree exemplifies how passion, determination, and wisdom can unlock new points of view, reveal new factual discoveries, and prompt positive change. The text not only inspires readers to do better and be better, both to the Earth and to each other, but also promises to change our perceptions of the forest and how some of nature's mysteries hold clues to our own life stories. Through documentation of revelations in her career and personal journey, Simard successfully presents a masterpiece filled with stories about love, heartache, loneliness, determination, longing, obstacles, and the need to discover truths. Not unlike many of her readers, her life is not void of challenges and barriers. However, she inspires readers to reach deeper, seek answers, embrace curiosity, and figure out how nature's intelligence might save us, to guide aspects in our own lives\u2014in parenthood, community, growth, perseverance, adaptability, and resilience. Book Review: Finding the Mother Tree Simard's memories demonstrate how she connects nature, human life, and her mission to piece together the puzzle of healing the natural world. Her remarkable discoveries in nature and herself resulted from her curiosity and determination to learn.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 92 Science has identified that the relationship between a pet and their family is mutually beneficial. Controlled research in anthrozoology has proved that pets can buffer stress, lower heart rate and blood pressure, give social support, help you stay in shape, and prevent certain types of sickness. Studies have also shown that pets are equally beneficial to children. A good relationship between a child and a pet will encourage cognitive stimulation, improve behavior, create a heightened understanding of others, increase immunity, and lower anxiety levels. It is also very beneficial, and in my opinion, imperative for children to be involved in the training process of puppies and new dogs. With guidance, children of any age can learn and administer the following methods and techniques. *Be sure to consider the temperament, age, and physical condition of the pet when utilizing these modalities. Purposeful Play\u2014 Take the time to be fully engaged with your pet during play (it can be fun for you too!). Use caution when playing with puppies under a year old. Excessive running, jumping, pulling or tugging can be harmful to the joints that are not fully developed. Be sure to monitor the intensity and duration of play with any pet of any age. Some breeds will continue to exert themselves as long as there is an arm available to throw a ball or a hand willing to tug a toy. Senior pets can still engage in modified play. In fact, this interaction can stimulate their mental state, improve their mood and support their quality of life. Experiment with modifications to your pet's favorite form of play and get creative! My 14-year-old German shepherd and 16-year-old labrador enjoyed laying on their beds and rolling a ball back and forth with me using their noses. Both dogs had corrective orthopedic procedures at younger ages, and like most senior pets, developed arthritis. So, going for walks was no longer an appropriate form of exercise for them. This engagement and mental stimulation kept them young at heart. A quick search for \"mental exercise for dogs\" will provide ideas and activities. Some benefits include improving behavior with other people, as well as with other dogs or cats. Preventing boredom, which can help eliminate undesired behaviors like excessive barking, chewing on household items, scratching doors or furniture, and digging. Not to mention that mental exercise makes them happy.Examples of mental exercise include: Puzzle toys, many of which can be DIY . Continue to challenge your pet by rotating these toys or providing a variety. Thinking games like hide and seek or teach your dog the name of their toys for an advanced form of fetch. New tricks and training. By the way, old dogs can learn new tricks...and they should! Teach new tricks yourself or enroll them in a training or obedience class (regardless of their age or existing abilities). Quick outings allow your dog to experience new things. Find a new place to walk, take them for a car ride when you run errands, or find stores which welcome pets, so they can shop with you. Quality Time. Nothing comes close to the effect of just spending time with your pet and letting them spend quality time with others. Simply talking and interacting with your dog while at home will greatly benefit both of you. Purposeful Petting\u2014 This intentional form of touch can soothe, calm, comfort, relax, and provide relief to your dog or cat. Sit quietly with your pet. Avoid the television, computer, or phone. Give them your full attention and allow yourself to be in the moment with them. Observe how your pet responds to different strokes, pressure, and/or the parts of your hand used. Be mindful and considerate with areas of known sensitivity and be sure to observe your pet's responses along the way. Also, make note of lumps, bumps or new areas of sensitivity and inform your veterinarian. Techniques or strokes include: \u00bb Slow, smooth, and long \u00bb Soft and sweeping- either short or long \u00bb Circular- in either a small or large circumference \u00bb Soft and gentle patting \u00bb Kneading or rocking Areas to target include: \u00bb center of the forehead, between the brow \u00bb length of ear flaps or edges of cropped ears \u00bb base of ears and jaw \u00bb length of back- use caution along the spine \u00bb chest and quads and hamstrings \u00bb feet and toes- *if your pet allows Engage with your pets. Play with your pets. Relax with your pets. It's mutually beneficial!

Stronger Relationships - Healthier Pets A good relationship between a child and a pet will encourage cognitive stimulation, improve behavior, create a heightened understanding of others, increase immunity, and lower anxiety levels. Senior pets can still engage in modified play. In fact, this interaction can stimulate their mental state, improve their mood and support their quality of life.Give them your full attention and allow yourself to be in the moment with them. Observe how your pet responds to different strokes, pressure, and/or the parts of your hand used.

Wish is a touching story about the power of kindness and the magic of friendship, with beautiful and emotive illustrations from Chris Saunders. Rabbit cannot decide what to wish for, so he asks his friends Mouse, Fox, and Bear what they would do if they had a wish. Being selfless and kind, Rabbit grants all three wishes to his friends. They are so grateful for his kindness and generosity, they share their wishes with him. Everyone Gets a SayBy Jill Twiss and EG Keller Pudding the snail and his friends can't seem to agree on anything. Whatever Jitterbug the chipmunk wants, Geezer the goose does not. Whatever Toast the butterfly wants, Duffles and Nudge the otters are absolutely against. And if somehow Toast and Duffles and Jitterbug and Nudge all agree on something, then Geezer is not having it. So, when Toast suggests they need a leader, the friends try to figure out the best way to pick someone to be in charge. Should that someone be the fastest? The fluffiest? The squishiest? Or can Pudding show his friends that there just might be a way where everyone gets a say? Jill Twiss and EG Keller cleverly underscore the importance of speaking up and using your voice. Bellies to the Sky By Coleen Canning It's time for sleep, little one. Breathe in and raise your belly to the sky. From the Serengeti to the Arctic mountains, animals guide their little ones to sleep under the stars. With accessible breathwork for kids, this bedtime book will help lead your little oneand youto a peaceful night's sleep. Beautifully written and illustrated, this book will provide everyone who reads and listens to it with a sense of calm and stillness. The Ogress and the Orphans By Kelly Barnhill Stone-in-the-Glen, once a lovely town, has fallen on hard times. Fires, floods, and other calamities have caused the people to lose their library, their school, their park, and even their neighborliness. The people put their faith in the Mayor, a dazzling fellow who promises he alone can help. After all, he is a famous dragon slayer. (At least, no one has seen a dragon in his presence.) Only the clever children of the Orphan House and the kindly Ogress at the edge of town can see how dire the town's problems are. Then one day a child goes missing from the Orphan House. At the Mayor's suggestion, all eyes turn to the Ogress. The Orphans know this can't be: the Ogress, along with a flock of excellent crows, secretly delivers gifts to the people of Stone-in-the-Glen. But how can the Orphans tell the story of the Ogress's goodness to people who refuse to listen? And how can they make their deluded neighbors see the real villain in their midst? The Aquanaut: A Graphic Novel By Dan Santat E ver since her father was lost at sea, Sophia has been moping around Aqualand, the marine theme park her dad and uncle created. But Sophia's world is turned upside down when an \"aquanaut\" breaks into the park's research lab. To her amazement, Sophia discovers that the aquanaut is not what it seems\u2014inside lives a band of four goofy sea creatures! And when they all realize that Aqualand has evolved into something much darker than Sophia's dad had envisioned, Sophia is determined to help the aquanaut crew free the park's captive marine life before it's too late.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 94 Country Fall FestivalsCountry Fall FestivalsCW Kids in the CW Kids in the Community ColumnCommunity Column Now that The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal is covering a larger geographical area, I'm excited to explore kids' events with you that are waiting just outside of Ann Arbor. Perfect for this new phase of expansion of the Journal are the fall festivals around Washtenaw County. You can get outside with your kids, eat a caramel apple, and relax in nature for a day of family fun. Here are some of my favorite kids' activities that will keep you and your kids healthy, active, and in the outdoors this fall in the countryside surrounding Ann Arbor. The Frosty Apple If you love apples and visiting the farm, The Frosty Apple is a different option northwest of Ann Arbor just north of Dexter. It's a family-owned apple orchard run by Julie Frost whose late husband Jack started the orchard years ago. They have a fully mature orchard now that Frost manages with her sister Janet, where they grow dozens of popular varieties of apples at super affordable prices. The orchard requires people to order online. You can also order pies for the holidays online or pick up extra delicious little treats, as long as they last on site, when you pick up pies and apples throughout the fall months. You can't pick apples at The Frosty Apple, as they have full-size trees that require staff to reach the apples safely, but you get great quality apples (you should see what they consider seconds\u2014they are flawless!). Make applesauce with the kids, bake pies, or keep a fridge full of apples to last the whole season. We bought several pies last year for the holidays, and it eliminated the pressure of baking before parties. The pies are so delicious that they've become a family favorite. Do not miss. Note that this orchard allows apples to be picked up as each variety comes into harvest season, and that timing can vary. See the website for up-to-date instructions on how that works. Contact the Frosty Apple at (734)707-9019 or visit them online at frostyappleorchard. com. Webster Fall Festival Just down the road from The Frosty Apple is the highlight of the year in Webster Township. Just northwest of Ann Arbor is the Webster Fall Festival. The festival runs at the end of September just as people are getting into the swing of all fall things. It includes many historic displays and events related to the township's historical residents. Think of it as a cross between a small-town fall festival and Greenfield Village. Festival PR rep Virginia Davis told us that everyone was relieved the festival was returning after a two-year hiatus due to the pandemic. The festival takes place on the grounds of the Webster Township Hall on Webster Road that connects Ann Arbor's northwest outer burb neighborhoods with Whitmore Lake and Hamburg to the north. The historic Webster United Church of Christ sits just across the road\u2014the longest continuously running church in the state of Michigan\u2014and features historic architecture and a family feel. \"The festival is co-sponsored by the Webster Township Historical Society and the Webster United Church of Christ,\" Davis explained. \"The 2020 festival was going to be the 39th annual festival, but since that and 2021 was cancelled, this year 's festival on September 24, will be the 39th.\" Davis said that the festival offers \"wholesome, old-fashioned country fun for the whole family. We have always focused on children's activities such as the traditional farm-animal petting zoo (usually chickens, bunnies, llamas, goats, and cows), hayrides, barrel train rides, hands-on rope making, corn shelling, games, and craft projects.\" This year, the local Girl Scouts are going to help with the children's activities. They will be dressed in period costumes that they will make themselves. \"We plan to offer hands-on demonstrations of traditional chores such as washing clothes in a wash bucket and then hanging on a line to dry, stringing sliced apples to dry, stringing green beans or 'Leather Britches' to dry, and possibly butter churning,\" Davis said. The Podunk one-room schoolhouse will have an in-costume school marm teach a few classes during the day. The resident blacksmith will give demonstrations throughout the day in the township's historic working blacksmith shop. Kids can work with the blacksmith to make simple projects. If that's not enough, penny candy will be on sale in the Kleinschmidt General Store, and they are hoping to have the cake and cookie walk again this year. \"Older children may be interested in the collection of antique tractors, cars and farm machinery on display, and demonstrations of tatting and wool spinning,\" Davis said. One of the most unique features of the Webster Fall Festival is the old-fashioned base ball (two words was the original way to spell this, Davis says) game between the Chelsea Monitor Base Ball Club and the Union Base Ball Club of Dexter. Webster Fall Festival goes all out to feature some of the most unique and fun historic country fair activities in a festival that brings together residents from the area for a day of outdoor activities. Not confirmed at the time I talked to Davis were possible sheep dog demonstrations or search and rescue dogs at this year's festival. For adults, you might enjoy live By Laura K. Cowan Perfect for this new phase of expansion of the Journal are the fall festivals around Washtenaw County. The festival runs at the end of September just as people are getting into the swing of all fall things. It includes many historic displays and events related to the township's historical residents.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 95 music on the Corncrib stage, arts and crafts for sale, homemade jams and baked goods in the Taste of Webster located in the Boy Scout Cabin, \"a soup and sandwich luncheon in the church, a quilt and art display in the sanctuary, hot dogs, chips, ice cream, and beverages for sale during the day, and a pulled pork sandwich beginning at 1 p.m. And I can't forget the Braun and Hellner antique auction at 9 a.m., and the flea market in the Scadin barn throughout the day.\" Whew. Is that enough to draw a crowd? This year we can't miss it! Learn more about the Webster Fall Festival at websterfallfestival.org or email websterfallfestival1@gmail.com. Wiard's Orchard Wiard's Orchard is an old favorite of many Ann Arbor townies, because it has everything you could want from a fall festival: apple picking, classic fall treats in their country store, plus a haunted house, hayrides, and more. Wiard's has changed many things for the sake of safety during the pandemic, so be sure to check their website for hours and rules of operation before your visit. During Covid, they created outdoor sanitizing stations, emphasized social distancing, and closed events they couldn't keep clean, like the corncrib. The country fair has remained open, and the giant slides. Wiard's even hired a sanitation team to keep outdoor exhibits extra clean these last two years. Masks were worn anywhere people couldn't easily distance by six feet. Wiard's has a moonwalk and a full haunted house plus haunted hayrides that run through the woods on a tractor-pulled wagon. They also run corn mazes. Wiard's host corporate picnics as well, so if you want to host a large party, you can get all the favorite activities and some special add-ons like mini golf, kids' games, and bubbles for your extravaganza. Wiard's created no less than 45 stations for hand sanitizers and hard surface sanitizers this last year. The country fair is different during the week than on the weekends. Wiard's event planner Rose Timbers says the best way to plan ahead is check out the Wiard's website to see what's happening at the \"Country Fair Wed-Fri or Sat-Sun.\" Any day you visit you can plan on the petting farm being open, plus the corn maze, and some outdoor events. Believe it or not, there's more! Visit Wiard's Orchard online at wiards.com or give them a call at (734)390-9211. Whitmore Lake Library Events Just off the second exit on US-23 north of Ann Arbor in downtown Whitmore Lake is the beautiful and historic Northfield Township Library, which is known for its fabulous children's events. Director Zaley Nelson has continued a tradition of extensive educational, fun groups and festivals that make this a destination for local families looking to entertain their kids rain or shine. Nelson told us that continuous programs will run in the fall including the NTAL Sprouts Story Time every Wednesday from 11-11:30 a.m. with Ms. Hillary, the Sprouts Sensory Play Group every Friday from 11 a.m. - 12 p.m., and for older kids the Michigan Education Trust meeting is on September 13th to talk about saving for college. The Northfield Area Township Library also has a Teen Advisory Board to discuss library matters and plan events. But, the really special event is the Annual Fall Fun Fest, September 24th from 10 a.m. - 2 p.m. This event features a petting zoo, outdoor games, chalk art, bubbles, and a special fall-themed craft for kids alongside a craft fair. We used to take our daughter to this event when she was a toddler and in early elementary, and it was one of the highlights of the year for her. Beyond the fabulous collection of children's books at this well-curated library staffed with enthusiastic librarians, you could not ask for a better way to make a kid excited to go to the library. For more information, you can contact the Northfield Township Library or check out their calendar of events online at ntal.org, call (734)449-0066 or email info@ntal.org. The Northfield Township Library is located at 125 Barker Road, Whitmore Lake, MI 48189.

They're open all day starting in August and sell pies and other extra treats on the weekends. \"Our cider mill is an active working mill and is proud to be a member of the Michigan Cider Makers' Guild,\" the owners said. \"With a passion of preserving our history, The Dexter Cider Mill has had very few changes to our processes over the past 132 years. From the authentic oak press and using a variety of local Michigan apples to create our own unpasteurized cider, to our natural setting along the Huron River... it's a little step back in time to how things used to be and have always been for us.\" One thing to note is that like any cider mill, The Dexter Cider Mill has a lot of bees swarming around the grounds because of the sweet sticky apple juice on the premises. If you or your kid is allergic to bee stings, please come prepared or plan to hop in for a bag of donuts and then eat off the premises. The Dexter Cider Mill can be combined with a day trip kayaking the Huron River or biking along Huron River Drive with the family. There is a new paved sidewalk stretching from Dexter near the Cider Mill to the west side of Ann Arbor at Zeeb Road to offer a safer sidewalk alternative for young kids just starting to bike. Learn more about the Dexter Cider Mill online at dextercidermill.com. Ypsilanti Library Events If you have a kid in Ypsi, or one who loves clubs instead of fall festivals, one final alternative is the awesome events at the Ypsilanti Public Library. There is a PrideZone group for 12-17-year-olds that meets in the fall at the library. \"PrideZone is a social and support group for teens 12-17-years old who identify as LGBTQ+,\" the event hosts said. \"It is a safe place to socialize, build community, and have fun in an open, queer space. Help us plan events like board game night, movie night, coming out over coffee, field trips, and craft nights.\" They also meet at Ozone House in Ann Arbor. Have a budding gardener in the family? The Seed Saving Group is another cool event for kids that goes from summer into fall!

Milan Fall Festivals Just down the street from Saline is Milan, also on the south side of Ann Arbor. Milan has an event called Scarecrows on Main for kids during their fall harvest festival, where kids can create their own scarecrows which are then used to decorate the downtown streets. The harvest festival includes free hayrides, donuts, music, and food. Separately, there is a Milan Fall Craft Show that's a big favorite among families and collectors. It's now held at the Milan High School cafeteria in Milan. This event is not specifically aimed at kids, but it is a fun family event to bring a kid to if they love arts and crafts. The Fall Craft Show features handmade, homemade, and homegrown items for sale. Fall decor is available for sale, and there is a coffee bar and sandwiches. If you can wait to shop until November, there is also a Pop on Main Street event that combines Small Business Saturday (the Friday after Thanksgiving) that encourages people to shop local with popup events, food, and special deals at local retailers.

Dexter Cider Mill It's no accident that the Dexter Cider Mill feels like a historic charming way to spend a fall weekend with the kids. This cider mill has been operating since 1886 west of Ann Arbor right on the Huron River and still cooks up the same favorites\u2014from caramel apples and cinnamon sugar donuts to real raw apple cider made on site in old wooden presses. Country Fall FestivalsCountry Fall FestivalsCW Kids in the CW Kids in the Community ColumnCommunity Column Continued This cider mill has been operating since 1886 west of Ann Arbor right on the Huron River and still cooks up the same favorites\u2014from caramel apples and cinnamon sugar donuts to real raw apple cider made on site in old wooden presses. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September through December 2022 Page 97 Conscious Parenting Column At 6 a.m. I woke up to sit with my sangha. I showered and jumped on an early- morning Zoom meeting. Afterward, I had 30 minutes to whip up breakfast and eat before I had to pick up my other son. I pulled out a pan and began frying eggs. My 12-year-old son walked into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator. \" No milk?!\" he snarled. I had forgotten to pick it up the day before. \" There's oat milk in there,\" I said calmly. \" It's gross! Great, this ruins my whole routine. Now I can't eat breakfast!\" He stormed off into his room and slammed the door.I'm really good at anger; I always have been. The fight response in my threat system is ready to launch. If I wanted to slip back into my old baseline of anger in that moment, I had plenty of reasons to: I was in a rush, I was hungry, I was feeling unappreciated for the things I didn 't forget to do for my sons, I was feeling vulnerable at my son's implication that my best wasn't enough, and I was feeling blamed for \" ruining\" my son 's morning routine. To cope, I could have become entangled in a storyline of how undervalued I am. I could have distracted myself by eating a few chocolate chips. I could have grabbed my phone and began scrolling. I could have started daydreaming about being on a mountain top away from all of this. But, this is how I learned how to meditate: not sitting for hours on a mountain top, transcending into light-filled states, but embodying these mundane moments in the midst of daily life. Mindful meditation is about seizing opportunities to find the aliveness in the present moment\u2014whether it is pleasant or unpleasant. The social media version of meditation is peacefully sitting on a quiet beach or monastery, eyes closed, posture in perfect form. But on a busy weekday morning, I was standing in my kitchen over a stove. I felt it was best to take a mindful moment with cooking to regulate my nervous system since it was right in front of me. For example, I noticed what a deep golden yellow the yolk was, and I watched the sides of the egg white, cradled by foaming butter, bubble in the hot pan. I listened to the soft sizzle the egg made as it cooked. The kitchen smelled of chocolatey undertone as coffee brewed, and I drew my attention to how cold the bottoms of my feet felt on the kitchen tile. Next, I took a deep breath from my lower belly to fill up my lungs, taking in sips of air, and slowly exhaled. Bringing in the senses and deep breathing engaged the \"rest and repair \" part of my parasympathetic nervous system, which is key to emotional regulation. I felt a shift, and it took about a minute to do. I slid my egg onto a plate and sat at my kitchen table. As I ate, I was able to access clarity to note prominent feelings I was experiencing. This is an important step for me because it helps me honor my feelings; otherwise, my reflex is to dismiss my feelings. However, if I dismiss them, it lessens my capacity to kindly hold space for other beings. Honoring my feelings helps me create space and access compassion for family, friends, and even strangers. For example, I had the capacity to consider that maybe my son was just hungry, or he felt unsupported by me with his new morning routine. It took less than ten minutes to navigate a mindful process to help regulate myself and get clarity. I paused, brought in the senses, accessed a deep breath, sat in my discomfort and vulnerability, and noted my prominent feelings. I practice on small stuff like this, and I practice with the big stuff. It's a lot of undoing and I 'm not going to get it right every single time. If I want to skillfully manage my anger, it requires both parts of mindfulness: self- awareness and lovingkindness. Self-awareness is bringing things like conditioning, beliefs, and patterns to the surface. Lovingkindness is holding that awareness without judgment. At this point I felt regulated enough to have a direct conversation with my son. I cleared the table and knocked on his door. I found him on the floor slouched against the wall on his phone, looking up at me. \" Can we talk?\" I asked. \" Yeah,\" he said, putting down his phone. \" Next time you are upset about there being no milk in the house, can you please take a pause? And say, 'He y mom, when you go out today can you pick up milk? I really wanted to have cereal this morning,'\" I said gently. \" I can't. It just comes flying out of my mouth,\" he said coldly. \" I know. I'm asking that you practice pausing.\" \" I know, mom...\" he said slowly smiling. I smiled back because at that moment I knew he had remembered our conversations on pausing and reactivity. I'm not asking him to perfect pausing\u2014my request of him was to simply practice it... just as I do. Twin sisters Trish Maley and Joy Aleccia have a business called Embracing Stillness.

Fortunately, this awareness has promoted understanding of what type of approaches might help support healing as well. Some of these approaches were known by our earliest ancestors, including creating images, movement, dance, music, and singing. Today we call these expressive arts therapies. As a registered art therapist for over 30 years, the beauty of art therapy to me has always been how available and accessible it is to anyone, regardless of ability or experience. Consciously or not, we are always editing the stories we tell about ourselves to align with our current experience. However, if we have had past traumatic experiences, or we were very young, our stories might be fragmented or beyond words, held as implicit memory, cognitively unavailable to us. Implicit memory may be the source for creating expressive and potentially healing artwork. In my early days as an art therapist, I was repeatedly awed by my clients' abilities to make unexpected connections and discoveries about themselves during the course of our work together, even though the expressive power of art is what drew me to becoming an art therapist in the first place. I have also been a yoga student for over 25 years, most often practicing Iyengar Yoga at Yoga Focus in Ann Arbor. In the words of Mary Dunn, who was an Ann Arbor native and founded the Iyengar Yoga National Association of the United States, \"People have incorrectly pigeonholed Iyengar Yoga into 'alignment, technique, props' rather than 'learning, experiencing, integrating'\u2014which I think are the real words.\" In these words, I heard a prescription for healing. Learning how to bring our bodies into alignment requires paying attention to where our bodies are in space, muscle tension, and inner felt sensations. Eventually, I would come to understand that implicit memories are held in our bodies and inform our posture and how we feel\u2014or don't feel\u2014our body. Implicit memory might be accessed in movement which dance therapists have always known. To me, this seemed similar to how implicit memory might be expressed in art therapy. Practicing yoga develops neural connections with the cognitive mind and the felt sensations in the body which may attune with our bodies' natural healing abilities. Could this be what is happening with creative expression in art therapy? My interest in learning and developing further awareness of felt experience to inform inner movement and posture during yoga practice and, more importantly, in my daily life, eventually led me to study Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction training developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn. Again, my attention was brought into my body, and my breathing. During body scan meditations\u2014which in the beginning were my least favorite meditation\u2014I slowly began to discover that by paying attention to places in my body that were tight or painful, while breathing, the tightness or pain would ease. Following these breadcrumbs down my personal path early in the Covid pandemic, eventually led me to learning about trauma sensitive yoga and earning certification as a Trauma Center Trauma Sensitive Yoga (TCTSY) Facilitator. Our current understanding of trauma is that it is a response of our brains and bodies to an experience or event that is deeply disturbing or distressing, and that it overwhelms a person's ability to cope. Traumatic experiences might contribute to emotional, physical, and cognitive problems. Research has also made us aware that traumatic experiences may be personal and specific, but trauma can also be experienced broadly through cultural and systemic biases, discrimination, and oppression. For some of us, the pandemic has been experienced as traumatic due to loss of loved ones, feelings of vulnerability and helplessness, and a loss of control over our lives. Choice making, invitational language, and shared authentic experience are several of the core elements of a TCTSY practice. The experience of trauma is disempowering. As a TCTSY Facilitator, I invite people to follow my movements during a practice, but they are also invited to make choices and move in their own way, depending on what they might notice in their own body, maybe a tight neck and shoulders, or shallow breathing. Sometimes people aren't aware of any sensations in their bodies. I have brought the principles of TCTSY into practicing both movement and art therapy with my clients. I often choose to call this a movement practice, instead of a yoga practice, because I have learned that people assume that there are specific poses in yoga, or they believe they can't do yoga. (Similar to people's beliefs about their ability to make art!) But if someone can sit in a chair and move an arm or foot, it is possible to participate in TCTSY . The challenge of the practice is to feel safe enough to bring awareness to how your body feels. In my practice, I offer the synergy of movement and art therapy, in a safe place for people who have experienced trauma; where they might feel seen and acknowledged. I offer to accompany clients as they explore and develop their inner awareness through making their own choices\u2014choices about how to move or what art materials they might use to express themselves and develop a sense of embodiment, agency, and empowerment in their lives. A session might begin with a brief seated movement practice to allow a participant to settle, ground themselves, become aware that they are breathing, and perhaps connect with how they feel in their body. Afterward, the participant is offered options for art making and creative expression. Someone might choose to make something with clay or mixed materials. Or the choice might be to continue a visual exploration of felt sensations through guided drawing. There is also the choice of only a movement practice or only art therapy. Both trauma sensitive yoga and art therapy nod to our ancient ancestors who innately knew that the ability to heal exists within ourselves through moving, telling stories with images and performance, creating rhythm, making music, and dancing in the company of others, both as participant, and as witness, to be seen and acknowledged in the moment of embodiment and experience. This is offered by all the expressive arts therapies. For my practice, I chose the synergistic potential of art and movement, to open a safe space for people who have experienced trauma, when words aren't enough.

Indian Philosophies on the Eve of Buddha's Enlightenment with David Mellins, PhD Saturday, October 22 10 a.m. - 1 p.m. While systematic schools of Indian philosophy had yet to be formalized as textual traditions in the 6th century BCE when Gautama Buddha attained his enlightenment, the ascetic mendicant Gautama encountered, studied and ultimately refuted a broad range of doctrines professing pathways to wisdom and spiritual emancipation.

It was a typically beautiful autumn afternoon in Ann Arbor, and I was happily wandering around the Farmers' Market in Kerrytown, heading toward the People's Food Co-op. Well, I was mostly happy, aside from that sort of nagging feeling rolling around in the dark back corners of my mind\u2014that antsy sense of restlessness about what's happening, (and not happening) with our environment, our climate, our depleting soil, our very soul as one entity\u2014human.... \"What is really happening here?\" Then, while crossing the street, something caught my eye and tickled my curiosity. It was some kind of art installation on wheels\u2014a whimsical, satirical moving mobile with a wheelchair at its base, an owl at its peak, and a huge \"blue marble\" Earth beach ball juxtaposed with a huge world globe in a garbage bag that is over-weighted by a money bag. A woman sat in the wheelchair, kind of feeble and huddled over wearing a nature scene-imprinted cape and hood. I was mesmerized, perplexed, and bursting with a joyful belly laugh. Feeling some intuitive sense of \"Yes,\" and of electric curiosity which indicated that I'm colliding with something special, I asked the tall man pushing the wheelchair, \"What are you guys doing?\" \"We're with Extinction Rebellion Ann Arbor,\" said John Donabedian (creator of Earthella). \"We're just trying to catch some eyeballs and raise some eyebrows about our planet.\" Donabedian and I talked about Earthella, the urgency of finding a sustainable balance with nature, and our mutual admiration of performance art. What really struck me was his contagious optimism about the human potential to solve our challenges. From talking with him, I was inspired by a sense of the human spirit's natural inclination to seek the path to equilibrium between people and planet. Then we talked about Extinction Rebellion (XR), how it began in England and rapidly grew into an international eco-conscious movement known for its creative approach to non-violent protests and \"staged disruptions\" targeting business-as-usual institutions. Although the group's name seemed to not be a great use of the Law of Attraction, I was hooked on the energy I felt being in conversation with folks using artistic expressions to make a difference in the world. I took a flyer and made a silent vow to show up to their next event. That event was a group meditation on the sidewalk in front of Liberty Plaza in December. While meditating on being good stewards of our beautiful planet, my toes and nose froze despite my red snowsuit. But I had finally found a community who felt as passionate as I do about making positive changes, and my heart was warm. After a few meetings with XRA2, a theme began to emerge. Donabedian and I consistently encouraged a joyful, constructive, affirming approach. The rest of the group wanted positive change and action, but their methods were more confrontational, antagonizing, and just didn't feel as good. They felt more like pushback against the negative rather than standing firm in the positive. There is not necessarily a right or wrong on this approach; we all must contribute in the ways we feel called to, but in a world rife with fear and opposition, when it comes to addressing the immensity of our challenges and the ensuing anxiety that can leave us feeling paralyzed and powerless, Donabedian and I agreed that creating joyful, unifying experiences that celebrate life on our amazing planet might just be the way to inspire others to stand up and protect our dear Mother Earth, and to move from feeling powerless to being empowered. So, somewhere out of the ether, Ann Arbor's Planet Parade & Action Network was born. We wanted it to be a monthly event (every first Sunday) so it could gain momentum and build a good reputation as a sure-fire way to invert the negative feelings of eco-anxiety into feelings of positive empowerment. We are taking steps, albeit baby steps, toward a more joyful and sustainable existence on our planet. It's been almost two years, and the snowball is growing! ...a sort of balance for our melting glaciers. So, what exactly is Ann Arbor's Planet Parade & Action Network? It's part dance party, part lecture hall, part spectacle, and part educational. It's entertaining and it's productive, a community's roundtable and workshop. It's sobering, uplifting, and always big fun with palpable positivity. More specifically, it's a sidewalk parade on Main Street with Earthella leading the way. It's live music from our house-band, Mary & The Huz Band, and other special musical guests. It's an open platform for issues of the day. It's street art / performance art with a poignant purpose, and it's an interesting discussion with a guest speaker addressing important local and global issues. Past speakers include State Representative from the 53 rd District, Yousef Rabhi, Michelle Deatrick, National Chair of the DNC Council on the Environment and Climate Crisis, mayoral candidate Anne Bannister, Ann Arbor for Public Power President Greg Woodring, A2P2's own Lauren Sargeant, and representatives from the anti-war/pro-eco/pro-female international organization Code Pink. In closing, we circle up for inspiration to feed our more spiritual sides and to nourish our hearts and minds so we may continue to keep walking, moving forward on a positive path. Eco-activist Linda Wan said, \"I look forward to the Planet Parade every month. It recharges my spirit. Music, dance, art, education, and calls to action\u2014all of these things, in equal measure. The serious parts help me to be a better advocate for action on the climate crisis. The fun parts are just plain joyful and remind me why this life and planet are worth agitating for.\" At this hour in our world, experiencing community, taking a stand for what matters to us, experiencing joy, having fun, and recharging our spirit can definitely help us overcome the weightiness of our times. Gathering monthly helps us recognize and realize our collective power to make the change and find hope for a brighter tomorrow. Please feel warmly invited to join us every first Sunday. We welcome your questions, stories, viewpoint, concerns, and creative endeavors. So come as you are, come as you can, do you, and help lift and be lifted by the power of pure positivity! Every first Sunday of the month the Ann Arbor's Planet Parade & Action Network event begins at 2:30 p.m. at the Sculpture Plaza near People's Food Co-op (Fourth & Catherine Street). The parade steps off at 3:00 p.m., and returns to Sculpture Plaza before 4:00 p.m. for the second half of the event which finishes around 5:00 p.m. For questions or for more information email a2planetparade@gmail.com.

That's how I got into animal communication; that's also what brought me to Betsy Bergstrom, a shamanic expert who has developed unique training in curse unraveling and compassionate depossession. A part of the training includes psychopomp, psycho from the Greek for \"spirit\" and pomp meaning \"to accompany.\" Basically, helping a person or animal to prepare for the transition to have a good death and a good crossing over. I learned how to approach these topics in a sensitive, compassionate way, having a deep and grounded presence with the process. I am honored to take this safe and sacred work to the community and to provide these services to those who ask for them. Shamanism addresses the spiritual aspects of healing. From a shamanic point of view, there are only three causes for illness: loss of power, loss of soul essence, and spiritual blockages or energies not to the highest good of a person. Chronic conditions such as depression, chronic illness, PTSD, addictions, or immune deficiency can all be indications of power or soul loss due to emotional or physical trauma. When a person (or animal) has power or soul loss, they are vulnerable to taking on energy from negative thought forms that don't have a spirit of their own or from opportunistic beings who do have a spirit of their own. CURSES Our words carry so much power, for good or bad. We can affect someone strongly through the words we use. Negative words, thoughts, and actions have energy. When they are directed to a person, group, or even to the land (such as construction or pollution on sacred places or burial grounds), they are called intrusions. A shamanic practitioner extracts those thought forms and their energy safely to help the person's spirit become stronger for healing itself. In olden times, people waged psychic warfare with curses, and they were taken very seriously. All of us can trace our lineage back to a culture that used curses this way. People went to someone who specialized in making curses and paid them to bind that curse strongly, sometimes affecting generations. Usually, a curse's strength will dissipate with time, especially if the person doing it or asking for it has passed on or made the curse unintentionally or incidentally. What a person puts out to the universe returns to them, so it never ends well, even for the perpetrator. When the energy of a negative thought form is directed to harm a person, it is a curse. Basically, if you are a human being, you've been cursed. It seems to be a part of the human condition. Curses can be intentional and professionally done, or unintentional, haphazard, and unstable. They can be something that happened in another lifetime, or pass through many generations, affecting a person's current circumstances. A person might find themselves with a chronic illness, a series of unfortunate events, addiction, or obsessive behavior. The practitioner conducts a series of shamanic journeys to 'diagnose' the curse, and to determine its origins, and what is giving the curse its strength. With the help of a spirit ally, the practitioner then unravels the curse and brings in blessing and healing for the client, their family, and, if needed, for their ancestors and descendants or their other lifetimes that were affected. It is a very freeing process after which the client may feel light and expansive. When I experienced curse unraveling for the first time, my practitioner and I were able to remove and heal a curse put on my husband's family from a blood feud in the 1800's\u2014a kind of Romeo/Juliet scenario. We were able to heal the past as well as future generations of relationships. The process is almost anti-climactic, without a lot of drama\u2014disappointing to those who have been fascinated by science fiction or cinematic accounts of curses. It is, however, a very practical and grounded process, leaving the client feeling more energetic.POSSESSIONS When a person's physical, mental and/or spiritual state is weak, they are vulnerable to opportunistic beings who have a soul of their own. Again, it seems to be part of the human condition\u2014if you are human, you probably have a possession of some kind. The possessing being may even have joined a person in a different lifetime or stayed through generations, having attached to a vulnerable ancestor who may have been in war, natural disaster, or severe illness. Frequently, the host person may be lackluster, having no enthusiasm for life, or have the opposite\u2014extreme mood swings and a reactive nature. The person may not have energy to do the activities of daily life, lack concentration and focus, and be easily distracted. The most important thing I learned from Betsy Bergstrom was that possessing beings are mostly suffering beings who are confused, lost, and trapped in places they never realized would become traps for them. It might even be a deceased relative who meant to take care of someone for a while and then couldn't leave on their own. The shamanic practitioner can remove the suffering being with the help of compassionate spirits and allies. When doing compassionate depossession, I have two clients\u2014the person who came to me and the being inhabiting them. As a practitioner, my goal is to completely untangle the two, to establish sovereignty for both, and to help each of them get to a safe place through heart-centered dialogue and work with compassionate helping spirits for as many generations or lifetimes as were affected. The healing is amazing, and the person feels more joyful without the heavy energy they've been carrying. When I found myself being constantly cranky, which is not like me, my practitioner found that I was possessed by the spirit of a toddler who fell overboard from a Chinese junk [ship] centuries ago. When her spirit left her body, she was confused and didn't know what to do. The most familiar energy that she was drawn to was in the boat\u2014her family, one of my ancestors\u2014so she attached herself and, centuries later, was still in my energy field. She left gratefully in the arms of angels who took her to her family, now long gone. Our ancestors knew of curses and possessions and lived with their reality. They knew that the wise woman or man of a village, the medicine woman of a tribe, or the shaman of a community could help them. Over centuries, people with the skills for unraveling curses and helping with depossession, and in fact, the possessing spirits themselves, were demonized by religions who wanted to be the only source that a person looked to for help. In the present time, we still feel uncomfortable talking about these subjects because of the drama surrounding them historically, and the threats and sanctions over centuries, not to mention the dramatic portrayals of possession from films and science fiction horror stories. What if there was no drama but only compassionate, thoughtful healing? What if these unravelings and depossessions could be done gently and lovingly? Betsy Bergstrom has figured this out, and I am honored to be able to offer it to you. It is a safe and gentle process, and I will support you through the entire procedure. To ask for more information, determine if you are eligible for this service, or to schedule a session, contact Judy Ramsey at info@judyramsey.net. Compassionate Depossession and Curse Unraveling With the help of a spirit ally, the practitioner then unravels the curse and brings in blessing and healing for the client, their family, and, if needed, for their ancestors and descendants or their other lifetimes that were affected. When a person's physical, mental and/or spiritual state is weak, they are vulnerable to opportunistic beings who have a soul of their own. Usually, a curse's strength will dissipate with time, especially if the person doing it or asking for it has passed on or made the curse unintentionally or incidentally.

Advent Retreat with Marty Lott, OP Sunday, December 4 - 8 \"I heard the bells on Christmas day, their old familiar carols play...\" We hear these \"old familiar carols\" earlier each year, not just on Christmas Day, in renditions both sublime and ridiculous. Yet, there is no other holyday/holiday in which music holds such significant role as it does at Christmas; it could be argued, that no other art conjures up such vivid memories and strong feelings as the songs and carols of Christmas. Moreover, these \"old familiar carols,\" when pondered, can help the soul feel it's worth and capture the great gift of the season. During this Advent retreat we will examine the spiritual meaning of some of these \"old familiar carols.\" Double occupancy $325. Single occupancy $425. Commuter $160.00.

With this and later books, the Dalai Lama brought Tibetan Buddhism and the situation in Tibet into prominent international awareness; he went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. Kindness, clarity, and insight--a curious sequence of words. What lies behind this title is the Buddhist practice of mind training . The Dalai Lama advises that anyone can take up Buddhist practices that they find useful without needing to become Buddhist or being religious at all. Yoga, by comparison, is a body-focused system of training from the Hindu religious tradition, but it now benefits people of all religions and no religion. Likewise, some Buddhist mind-training practices\u2014including mindfulness and lovingkindness ( metta ) meditation--have been adapted for the wellbeing of millions of people far beyond the bounds of Buddhist religion. So, one can see the Buddhist tradition as a library of practices and techniques, for changing our minds and transforming consciousness. This library has three main sections: practices for opening the heart, practices for calming and clarifying the mind, and practices for seeing into the nature of reality. Climate change, political upheaval, racism, gun violence, sexism, and pandemic: the world seems a snarl of pain and stress. Sometimes it may feel as though our best efforts are useless\u2014or are even making things worse. Buddhists call this \"cyclic existence,\" our grasping minds leading us around in painful and futile circles. Once the Buddha was asked this question: \"The inner tangle and the outer tangle\u2014this generation is entangled in a tangle. Who succeeds in disentangling this tangle?\" He replied: \"When a wise person, established well in virtue, develops consciousness and understanding, then as a practitioner ardent and sagacious, they succeed in disentangling this tangle.\" This means that we disentangle our heart-minds\u2014and contribute to the healing of the world--by dedicating ourselves (\"ardent\") to training in virtue, mental power (\"consciousness\"), and wisdom. In other words, kindness, clarity, and insight. Underlying these practices is the idea that we all suffer needlessly because we aren't awake to ourselves, to others, and to the world. We don't see things as they are. If we can train our minds to be steady, sharp, and clear, we will see things more realistically and create fewer problems for ourselves and others. What now seems murky, alienating, and stressful will shine forth as transparent, peaceful, and intimate. Our actions will be spontaneous, sure, and graceful. This is awakening ( bodhi ), or as we used to call it, enlightenment. But again, even if you don't buy this underlying idea, you may still find benefit in some Buddhist practices. It is said that the Buddha's teaching has a \"come and see\" (ehi passako) quality. All are welcome to try things just to see if anything is helpful. The Buddha is often compared to a good doctor; like a good doctor, he gives different medicines to different people; there are a great many medicines in the pharmacy of his teachings. Here we will just briefly outline a few of the mind-training practices of Buddhist tradition. Kindness The Dalai Lama says, \"While I am a Buddhist, my true religion is kindness.\" He advises us to open our hearts by any means necessary, relying for inspiration on our own traditions or on practices from other cultures. Kindness is the true source of our own happiness, our welfare, and that of others. One important practice is to make a commitment to ourselves, in presence of whatever we hold sacred, to minimize the harm we do to ourselves and other living beings. Ahimsa , nonviolence or non-harm, is at the heart of the Buddhist tradition. Taking this seriously means recognizing that we really can never be perfect in this regard. Vietnamese Buddhist teacher, Thich Nhat Hanh, says that the principle of non-harm is like the North Star. We guide our lives by it, without ever expecting to reach it. Going beyond non-harm, there is the practice of extending lovingkindness (metta ) to ourselves and to other living beings. It must start with genuinely wishing well for ourselves, loving and caring for ourselves. Then we train in extending that sense of care outward, one specific person at a time, as far as we can. The Buddha taught this ideal: Let none through anger or ill-will wish harm upon another. Even as a mother protects with her life her child, her only child, so with a boundless heart should one cherish all living beings, radiating kindness over the entire world: spreading upwards to the skies, and downwards to the depths, outwards and unbounded. We find it extremely challenging to extend this kind of loving care to certain people; we have resentments and grudges extending in many directions! The tradition gives many different suggestions about how to deal with this. Just one example: consider how harboring resentment is painful for you and does no one else any good. Others may have harmed you, but holding a grudge only adds to that harm! Clarity The world is chaotic because our minds are chaotic; they seem naturally to leap about from one thing to another. Buddhist teachers sometimes compare this to the way a monkey jumps about. The Christian teacher John Cassian said that our minds are driven by random incursions, wandering from object to object as though drunk. In other words, the world is murky and confusing because we struggle to calm our minds down enough to bring things into focus. Meditative practice involves choosing an object of attention--our breath, a single word, an image, or even an idea--and seeking to stabilize our minds on it. Very quickly we become distracted--and when we notice this we immediately and gently bring our minds back to the chosen object. It is just like learning any new skill; we are persistent but gentle with ourselves, and gradually we improve. As our minds settle down a bit, as they become more peaceful, they also become clearer and sharper. And so, they are more useful for whatever we want to do. Insight Evolution, or karma, seems to have given us strong tendencies toward certain misapprehensions. We know that things are constantly changing, instant by instant, but we normally speak and act as though this were not true. In other words, it usually feels to us as though we were stable selves, existing independently of the world. And it somehow seems natural and right that we prioritize our own desires over those of others. Upon reflection, with introspection, we can see that\u2014like a river\u2014we are constantly changing and constantly interacting with the rest of the environment. In fact, just as there is no single object or moment that you can pin down and point out as \"the river,\" it is the same with us. We are bundles of shifting feelings, sensations, and thoughts; we are bodies with countless parts intricately woven. With clarity of mind and motivated by kindness, we can understand, and then experience, our intimate relations with every thing and person we usually take as \"other.\" Then, an act of care is not a chore or sacrifice or duty, but a natural reflex whenever we see pain and have a chance to help. Guy Newland is a professor who has taught Asian religions at Central Michigan University for 34 years; he also teaches a course called \"The Meaning of Life.\" He translates Tibetan texts and has studied with many Tibetan teachers in the US and in India. He has taught at about a dozen Buddhist centers across the United States, including Jewel Heart in Ann Arbor. Newland's publications include A Buddhist Grief Observed (Wisdom Publications, 2016) and Introduction to Emptiness (Snow Lion/Shambhala, 2009).Changing Our Minds: Kindness, Clarity, and Insight Kindness, clarity, and insight\u2014a curious sequence of words.
