But this does not mean that health careprofessionals should practice evidence-based medicine. This dissertation explores how these twopositions come apart, why they come apart, and what we should do about it. I begin byanswering the descriptive question, what are current standards of evidence in medicine? I thenprovide a detailed critique of these standards. Finally, I address the more difficult normativequestion, how should we determine standards of evidence in medicine?In medicine, standards of evidence have been established by the pervasive evidence-basedmedicine (EBM) movement. Until now, these standards have not been subjected tocomprehensive philosophical scrutiny. I outline and defend a theory of knowledge - a version ofHelen Longino's Critical Contextual Empiricism (CCE) - which enables me to critically evaluateEBM. My version of CCE emphasizes the critical evaluation of background assumptions. Inaccordance with this, I identify and critically evaluate the three substantive assumptionsunderlying EBM. First, I argue that medicine should not be held to the restrictive definition ofscience assumed by proponents of EBM. Second, I argue that epidemiological evidence shouldnot be the only \"base\" of medical decisions. Third, I argue that not only is the particularhierarchy of evidence assumed by EBM unjustified, but that any attempt to hierarchically rankiiiresearch methods is incoherent and unjustifiably restricts medical knowledge. Current standardsof evidence divert attention from many legitimate sources of evidence. This distorts medicalresearch and practice.In the remainder of the dissertation I propose means for improving not only current standards ofmedical evidence but also the process of producing and defending future standards. On the basisof four CCE norms, I argue that we have reason to protect and promote those features of themedical community that facilitate diversity, transparency, and critical interaction. Only then canwe ensure that the medical community retains its ability to produce evidence that is both rigorousand relevant to practice.ivAcknowledgementsI wish to thank my supervisor, Margaret Morrison, for her good judgment on everything from thescope and content of the thesis to the inner workings of academia.

This dissertation explores howthese two positions come apart, why they come apart, and what we should do about it. In thechapters that follow, I identify the assumptions underlying current standards of medicalevidence, evaluate those assumptions, and suggest structural changes that could enhance thecapacity of medical research communities to produce knowledge. In this introduction I motivatethe project, situate it within philosophy, and provide an overview of the chapters to come.1. Why Standards Matter: ECMOStandards of evidence have a direct impact on the lives and deaths of human beings. Thefollowing case demonstrates this impact unambiguously.1 Persistent pulmonary hypertension(PPHS) is a condition that affects neonates (newborns), and until the late 1970s PPHS had anestablished mortality rate of around 80%. Neonates with PPHS have underdeveloped lungs andas a result are unable to adequately oxygenate their blood. Because the etiology of the diseasewas well known, researchers were able to develop a treatment - called \"extracorporealmembrane oxygenation\" (ECMO) which involves removing blood before it reaches the lungs,oxygenating it artificially with a machine, warming it back to body temperature, and thenreturning it to the body. In effect, what the treatment does is keep the infant alive while the lungshave a chance to complete their development. The initial results were impressive. 45 neonateswere treated over a period of several years and mortality rates dropped below 20% for thatgroup.2 This dramatic improvement in survival was not linked to any other suspectedconfounding factors and the population (neonates) was hardly in a position to influence the datathrough expectations of success of a new treatment or the like. Because all infants were treated 1 The ECMO case was brought to my attention by Robyn Bluhm, and I have since benefited from the descriptionand analysis offered by John Worrall in his article \"Why There's No Cause to Randomize.\" No doubt there aremany other cases in which unnecessary research, conducted out of a misguided commitment to inappropriatestandards of scientific rigor in medical research, resulted in unjustified pain, suffering, disease and death. TheECMO case, however, does a particularly good job of highlighting what goes wrong when standards of evidence areapplied uncritically. There are no clear distinctions between ethical and epistemological issues in this domain.2 Bartlett et al., \"Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Newborn Respiratory Failure.\"2with ECMO, there were none of the standard concerns with selection bias, and it was extremelyunlikely that the disease had radically changed in character in that short time period. Noplausible alternative explanations for the change in survival rate were offered.3In spite of the dramatic results of the new treatment, researchers felt compelled toperform a randomized controlled trial (RCT), which tests new treatments against placebo or bestavailable treatment.4 Though they fully expected infants in the ECMO group to live and those inthe control group to die it was decided that only an RCT could establish their findingsconclusively. Until then all they had was the historically-controlled data from their initialinvestigations. This data, when analyzed, amounted to a case-control study, which is notregarded as especially good evidence in medicine.5 There was a particular concern that fellowmedical practitioners would dismiss any results that fell short of the RCT standard.6 So they wentahead with an RCT, the results of which were published in 1985.7 The researchers used amodified randomization protocol that allowed them to increase the odds of receiving ECMOwith each positive result. Because of this methodology - proposed, no doubt, to ease theconsciences of those participating - 12 infants were enrolled in the trial, 11 of whom receivedECMO and lived and 1 who received standard care and died. Response by the medicalcommunity indicated that these results were not convincing because the control group consistedof only one patient. Critics called for further research.8 A second randomized trial wasperformed.The results of the second, fully randomized trial enrolled 19 infants. 9 received ECMOand lived and of the 10 receiving standard care 6 survived.9 The insistence that a second RCT beconducted directly contributed to the deaths of 4 infants given standard care. The status of theevidence produced by the historically controlled initial data, the first partially-randomized trialand the second fully-randomized trial is clearly at issue here. If the standards of evidenceaccepted by the medical community had allowed the initial historically controlled results to 3 Ibid.4 See Chapter Three for definitions and descriptions of medical research methods.5 I discuss the reasons for the low rank assigned to case-control studies in Chapter Three.6 The influence of the new field of clinical epidemiology, which stressed the importance of RCTs, can be noted herealmost a decade before the official declaration of evidence-based medicine (EBM). These pressures have onlyincreased over time, as I explain further in Chapter Three.7 Bartlett et al., \"Extracorporeal Circulation in Neonatal Respiratory Failure\".8 Bartlett and Cornell, 65.9 Ware.3count as significant evidence of efficacy, the subsequent trials would not have been conducted.The new treatment would have been accepted in much the same way that penicillin was acceptedyears before.10 Even standards of evidence that allowed the first partially randomized trial tocount as significant evidence of efficacy would have eliminated the need for any further RCTand prevented the loss of many lives.11Several years after this controversy had blown over, lead researchers Robert Bartlett andRichard Cornell responded to an article by statistician Richard Royall, in which Royall calls thelater ECMO trials unnecessary and unethical. Bartlett and Cornell acknowledge that they felt\"compelled\" by their colleagues to produce RCT evidence for ECMO and conclude theirresponse to Royall by saying that in future research investigating the use of ECMO for pediatricand adult respiratory failure, \"If we propose an approach without randomization to conventionaltherapy, we certainly will consider calling on Dr. Royall to argue our case with the NIH studysection, the insurance carriers and editors of scientific journals.\"12 In this statement, Bartlett andCornell expose some of the pressures felt by medical researchers; when RCTs are the goldstandard researchers feel compelled to produce RCTs - even when for a particular case the RCTmethod may be unnecessary, inappropriate, or even unethical.The ECMO case forcefully demonstrates the impact of standards of medical evidence.This is not an exceptional case, though it is one of the most dramatic. Countless lessons can begleaned from this case. Many of the more critical lessons require detailed explanation of the sortthat appears later in this dissertation. For now I will draw attention to the impact of standards ofevidence on the health and well-being of research subjects and patients generally. Standards ofevidence had life and death implications for the neonates in the later ECMO trials. In light ofthese very serious consequences, the standards of evidence requiring RCTs had better bejustified. And yet quite often these standards are not explicitly justified. Many of the samecriteria for evidence identified by the researchers in the ECMO trials exist today. In fact, they arearguably more entrenched today than they were in the early days of clinical epidemiology whenthe ECMO case was occurring. Insistence on RCTs, the devaluation of pathophysiologic 10 Ligon. The pivotal experiment, conducted in 1939, was an animal trial on eight mice. Within the 24 hours the fourmice assigned to the control group were dead of streptococcal infection, while the four penicillin-treated mice werealive. This was treated as \"miraculous\" evidence, and within a year expanded animal trials were written up andpublished in the highly regarded medical journal, The Lancet.11 According to Worrall, this saga continued: a third RCT was performed at the request of statistician Stuart Pocock.Like Worrall, I do not see the need to belabour this point so will not discuss this last trial in any detail.12 Bartlett and Cornell, 65.4reasoning, and the disdain for historically controlled trials and experiential evidence - these areall themes found in evidence-based medicine. The lack of explicit justification for thesestandards is one of the central concerns of this dissertation.The ethical implications of standards of evidence are overwhelming when considered inthe context of the tens of thousands of people who are research subjects in a given year, but arepositively frightening in light of the even greater number of people who depend on the results ofresearch for their health and well-being. For every loss of life in the ECMO trials there werecountless other losses in hospitals around the world while physicians waited for conclusiveevidence of the efficacy of ECMO. For every unnecessary trial there are victims within the trialand in society generally. Research that addresses the wrong questions, or investigates goodquestions with inappropriate methods, will ultimately waste time and resources, risk lives, andmay not be able to stand up to ethical scrutiny.2. Standards of Evidence and the Rise of Evidence-based MedicineAs the ECMO case demonstrates, the question of what counts as good evidence in medicine is ofcritical importance to physicians, philosophers and, ultimately, all of us as potential patients. Oneattempt to determine standards of evidence for medicine has been made by proponents of theevidence-based medicine (EBM) movement, as outlined in the ground-breaking 1992 article,\"Evidence-based Medicine: A new approach to teaching the practice of medicine,\" and revised inthe oft-cited clarificatory article four years later, \"Evidence-based Medicine: What it is and whatit isn't.\"13 According to the latter, EBM is \"the conscientious, explicit and judicious use ofcurrent best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients.\"14 In spite of adeluge of critiques in a range of medical journals, the EBM movement has been highlysuccessful in capturing the attention and allegiance of many physicians, journal editors,administrators, and funding agencies, and is now a pervasive presence within health care systemsworldwide. At the heart of the movement is a hierarchical ranking of research methodologies -the \"evidence hierarchy\" - which was created to assist researchers in assessing the relative valueof evidence produced by various research methodologies, and to assist physicians in assessing 13 Evidence Based Medicine Working Group, \"Evidence-based Medicine: A new approach to teaching the practiceof medicine\"; Sackett et al., \"Evidence-based Medicine: What it what it isn't.\"14 Sackett et al., \"Evidence-based Medicine: What it is and what it isn't,\" 71.5the results of research so that they might use it in practice. This hierarchy has been left largelyintact throughout the various iterations of the movement's ideology, and contains a great deal ofthe actual content of EBM.15 The hierarchy of interest in this dissertation - that of medicaltreatments - places meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) at the top as bestevidence. Located at the bottom of the hierarchy are the sources of evidence regarded as leastreliable, such as case studies and anecdotal evidence. In this dissertation I will provide adescription and critical analyses of the current standards of medical evidence represented byEBM. I intend this analysis to extend beyond the current focus on EBM and address questionsabout standards of evidence and their justification more generally. Thus while EBM is the focusof my attention because of its prominent role in determining current standards of evidence, theanalysis will be relevant to the justification of any future standards of medical evidence.3. Locating the Project within Philosophy3.1. Role of PhilosophersAs the EBM ideology is rapidly and rather uncritically adopted in medical settings around theworld, as well as integrated into new domains (\"evidence-based practice\" is now common inpublic policy, social work and some domains of complementary and alternative medicine, forinstance), concern about the assumptions, implications and epistemological limitations of suchan approach are mounting. Brian Haynes, one of the leading proponents of EBM, has issued achallenge:One hopes that the attention of philosophers will be drawn to...the continuing debateabout whether EBM is a new paradigm and whether applied health care research findingsare more valid for reaching practical decisions about health care than basicpathophysiological mechanisms and the unsystematic observations of practitioners.16 15 Ibid.16 Haynes, \"What kind of evidence is it that Evidence-Based Medicine advocates want health care providers andconsumers to pay attention to?\" 3.6The demand for philosophical attention to EBM is not only coming from the medical field. In apaper on randomized controlled trials and research methods in medicine, philosopher JohnWorrall writes:This is an area to which philosophers ... have given relatively little attention. Yet thereare few areas to which they might contribute that have such enormous practicalsignificance - involving, as it does, issues that are often literally matters of life anddeath.17I share Worrall's optimism regarding the value of philosophy and agree with Haynes and otherEBM proponents when they suggest that philosophical perspective is just what is needed incurrent debates over standards of evidence in medicine. Contrary to popular images of armchairphilosophers and secluded ivory towers, philosophical investigation can contribute in meaningfulways to many avenues of inquiry, including the evaluation of standards of evidence employed byvarious scientific communities. Traditionally, philosophical analyses of issues in the domain ofmedicine have been a part of the sub-discipline of bioethics.3.2. Bioethics and Philosophy of MedicineThe field of bioethics first emerged in the late 1960s as a product of several different academicdisciplines including philosophy, theology, medicine and law. It was charged with the weightytask of uncovering and evaluating the ethical controversies raised by medical practice andmedical research. Because philosophy had for many centuries been the primary location ofsecular academic debate on metaethics (the delineation and analysis of moral concepts,reasoning, and justification), normative ethics (the determination of how moral agents shouldbehave), and practical ethics (the application of normative ethics to practical problems), bioethicswas from the outset seen primarily as a sub-discipline of philosophy. As it evolved into a maturediscipline over the years, it retained the traditional philosophical emphasis on critical evaluation,conceptual analysis, and the careful development of ethical theories.18 While bioethicists haveshifted their focus from normative ethics to applied ethics (and perhaps back again), the focus ofthe field of bioethics has, unsurprisingly, been on the ethical issues arising in the medical 17 Worrall, \"Controlling Clinical Trials: Some Reactions to Randomization.\"18 Borry, Schotsman and Dierickx, 58.7context. Too often overlooked in these discussions are the metaphysical and epistemologicalissues that arise in the medical context. Commitment to a sort of na\u00efve realism, expectations thatmedicine is unproblematically scientific, and assumptions that the methods and models ofscience have been conclusively established are rife within the medical and bioethical contexts.These and other metaphysical and epistemological assumptions underlie standards of medicalresearch and practice, and are in need of greater philosophical scrutiny.Medicine as a field has suffered as a result of disproportionate attention to ethical issues.The ECMO case demonstrates how inattention to epistemological issues in medicine can havenegative ethical implications. Concerns by researchers in complementary and alternativemedicine about the metaphysical assumptions underlying medical research (for instance,mechanistic assumptions) have been largely ignored in the medical literature and scholars withthe philosophical training to address such challenges, and to provide a defence of suchassumptions, have not yet been drawn into the debate. There are countless other such examples,many of which will be raised later in the dissertation. While medical ethics - or bioethics today -is ostensibly an all-encompassing term for the ways in which philosophy and medicine intersect,it has been dominated by ethical concerns. This needs to change if we are to come to a morecomprehensive understanding of health, disease, and the practice of medicine. A change wouldbe most accurately reflected in a shift to \"philosophy of medicine\", though a shift in contentwithin bioethics would be a good start. In retrospect it is surprising that philosophers acceptedthe idea that ethical issues could be discussed in isolation from metaphysical and epistemologicalissues. Perhaps a more charitable reading of the evolution of the emerging field of bioethicswould suggest that philosophers and other scholars began with the most pressing and life-threatening issues (those properly in the domain of ethics) simply because they were so urgent.Whatever the reason, a return to broader philosophical issues in medicine is overdue.19While ethical issues are raised in much of my discussion, and are thus an important partof related future projects, the content of this thesis is largely epistemological. My aim is toprovide a comprehensive epistemological assessment of current standards of medical evidence.The relationship between theories, hypotheses and evidence and the role of biases and values in 19 As a matter of disciplinarity, this means that bioethics should be reformed and renamed philosophy of medicinewith a broader and more inclusive research agenda.8science have been the subject of much discussion in epistemology. I draw upon important newdevelopments in epistemology in order to set out a framework for analyzing EBM.3.3. Epistemological FrameworkIt might be possible to critically analyze current standards of evidence in medicine withoutproposing a specific epistemological framework. A traditional critical analysis would point outinappropriate goals set by EBM, and the gaps between the goals of EBM and the means settledon to achieve those goals. I decided to do more than this for the following reasons. There havebeen hundreds of papers written on EBM in the medical literature over the past fifteen years. Aquick scan through the references for this thesis provides some indication of this large, andgrowing, body of critical literature. The critical analyses provided in the medical literature have,however, been piecemeal and scattered - in part because of the limited word-count of journalarticles as compared to books or dissertations, but also because of repetition of the same centralpoints in most articles. This indicates the need for a more comprehensive critical analysis. Thelength of this dissertation provides me with an opportunity to provide this more comprehensiveanalysis.Moreover, the critical literature has tended to be just that: critical. Few scholars havepursued the constructive project of setting out principles and processes to guide the formation ofstandards of evidence. In order to pursue a project that is both comprehensive and constructive,that is, in order to provide a normative account of how standards of evidence ought to be justifiedin the medical context, I need epistemological concepts such as evidence, objectivity andjustification. A critical philosophical assessment of standards of evidence requires an explicitaccount of evidence. Because concepts like evidence have many different meanings according toa wide variety of particular epistemological theories, the selection of one theory provides mewith a basic understanding of these concepts from which to build my own framework. Thedevelopment of a particular epistemological theory allows me to provide a more detailedassessment of EBM.It is my hope that the epistemological framework utilized in this dissertation provides theopportunity not only for critical evaluation, but for deep critical evaluation of EBM in a way thatidentifies the underlying epistemological assumptions of the movement and the changes that9would be necessary in order to improve current and future standards of evidence. To use amedical analogy, this is akin to the difference between diagnosing a syndrome - which isessentially a cluster of symptoms with a name (for instance, irritable bowel syndrome) - anddiagnosing any disease with an established etiology (for instance, a streptococcal infection in thethroat). Not only is the second diagnosis more accurate, since it identifies the root of the problem(a certain strain of bacteria), it is more productive in that it makes the choice of treatment a lotmore straightforward (though never entirely formulaic). Physicians know what killsstreptococcal bacteria and what does not and how serious the infection can be if left untreated,and thus are able to have a productive and effective conversation with the patient about the bestpossible treatment. When a syndrome is identified, the conversation with the patient can occur,but there is a lot more trial and error required in determining appropriate treatment. Knowing thesource of the problem is valuable. Returning to the project of this dissertation, I am concernedthat a critical analysis of EBM that fails to sort out the complex and difficult epistemologicalissues surrounding evidence and justification will amount to a diagnosis of a syndrome, ratherthan a disease. This is especially true given that I will argue that the EBM movement is anattempt to delineate criteria for justification in the medical context, and thus is an attempt toconstrain what counts as knowledge in medicine. Continuing with the analogy, I believe it willbe much more effective to treat the problems with current standards of evidence in medicine if aparticular epistemological framework is in place. The specific reasons for the choice of the socialepistemological framework will be outlined in Chapter One.3.4. ContextIt is worth briefly tracing the relationship between the project of this dissertation and otherprojects in the social sciences and humanities, if only to clarify what I will not be addressing. Ahistorically-oriented approach might look at how standards of evidence have been defined andaltered throughout the history of medicine. Something like this has been offered by Jeanne Dalyin her recent book Evidence-based Medicine and the Search for a Science of Clinical Care.20 Incontrast, a sociological perspective might focus on the ways in which professions shape, and areshaped by, current standards of evidence and the sorts of power relations and institutional 20 Daly.10practices that are enhanced, upheld or reinforced by different standards. Stefan Timmermans andMarc Berg have pursued a project of this sort in their book The Gold Standard: The Challenge ofEvidence-based Medicine and Standardization in Health Care.21 Each of these projects addsmuch to our understanding of EBM. The critical analysis of this dissertation is complemented bysuch projects, and they have contributed greatly to my understanding of EBM as a historically-located and socially-driven movement. I believe, however, that our understanding of issuesraised by standards of evidence in medicine would be incomplete without attention to the strictlyepistemological issues raised by EBM. In this dissertation I do not focus on the historicallydescriptive question, 'how did such standards come about?' or any of the possible socialquestions, including, 'what interests are upheld by current standards?' Instead I begin byanswering the descriptive question, what are current standards of evidence in medicine? I thenprovide a detailed critique of these standards. Finally, I address the more difficult normativequestion, how should we determine standards of evidence in medicine?It has often been said that when the time is right for an idea, thoughtful people willconverge on it. It is a hopeful sign, then, that scholars in the humanities have begun to addresssome of the issues raised in the medical context in recent years. Kenneth Goodman has writtenon Ethics and Evidence-based Medicine (2003) and there have been two other efforts byphilosophers to offer critiques of the epistemology of EBM. Doctoral theses by Robyn Bluhm(University of Western Ontario, 2005) and Maya Goldenberg (Michigan State University, 2007)are two such projects.22 While there are similarities between these two projects and the generalaim of this dissertation, my work is unique in three important respects. First, by making use of asocial epistemological framework I am able to frame my critique in a way that differs from bothBluhm and Goldenberg. Bluhm offers a more historically-oriented critical analysis, andGoldenberg offers a \"Davidsonian\" analysis that draws upon work by Sharyn Clough. WhileBluhm's historically-informed analysis does an excellent job of identifying the forces that haveshaped EBM and Goldenberg's \"Davidsonian\" account ties ethical issues more centrally intoconcerns about evidence, neither has the resources to provide specific suggestions on how torestructure social institutions and practices in order to improve standards of medical evidence. 21 Timmermans and Berg.22 Bluhm, \"The 'hierarchy of evidence' Implications for evidence-basedmedicine\"; Goldenberg, \"Advancing an Ethics of Evidence: A critical appraisal of evidence based medicine andfeminist theories of evidence.\"11The social epistemological framework I have chosen allows me to provide just these sorts ofdetailed constructive suggestions. Second, I offer a thorough discussion of the standards ofevidence employed in Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) - a project that bothBluhm and Goldenberg have recognized as an important element in the critical constructiveproject, though which neither of them has addressed in detail. Third, Bluhm, Goldenberg and Ieach come to slightly different conclusions about EBM. Though we are all in general agreementthat the principles of EBM are problematic, we are inclined to locate the problems in slightlydifferent places. This collegial disagreement will, I am certain, be the source of future criticaland collaborative projects.234. The Argument AheadIn what follows I provide an overview of the arguments advanced in this dissertation.4.1. Chapter One: Social EpistemologyTraditional epistemologists examine the necessary and sufficient conditions for individualknowledge. Social epistemologists expand this project to include investigations into the socialdimension of knowledge. Based on the strengths of social epistemological theories in managingsocial values, justifying social practices already common in the sciences, and providingexplanations of the epistemological status of testimony, authority and expertise, I defend socialepistemology as the most accurate and comprehensive approach to epistemology available today.Further, I specify criteria for the selection of the best social epistemological theory. According tomy criteria, the best theory: focuses on justification, preserves individualistic intuitions, providesmechanisms for managing social values, and offers a robust account of the sociality ofknowledge. On the basis of these criteria, I narrow the options down to one: critical contextualempiricism (CCE). 23 This collaboration has already begun. Robyn Bluhm, Maya Goldenberg and I have recently presented together ontwo panels: the Canadian Society for History and Philosophy of Science Annual Meeting in Saskatoon (May, 2007)and the First Biennial Conference of the Society for Philosophy of Science in Practice in The Netherlands (August,2007). We have also been invited to act as guest editors for a second special issue on EBM in the journalPerspectives in Biology and Medicine. (Robyn Bluhm and I edited the first such special issue in 2005.)124.2. Chapter Two: Critical Contextual EmpiricismCCE, which was originally proposed by philosopher of science Helen Longino, has been one ofthe leading theories in social epistemology for the past decade.24 In the second chapter, I outlinethe core elements of this theory and extract a method for analyzing standards of evidence. Idevelop a version of CCE that enables me to critically evaluate EBM on a variety of fronts. CCEis critical because it stresses the role of intersubjective critical debate in the production ofknowledge. It is contextual because it takes the cognitive goals and practical aims of communitymembers seriously when determining standards of evidence. And it is empirical because itstresses the importance of empirical adequacy as a criterion of knowledge (particularly scientificknowledge). I defend CCE from objections raised by Solomon, Richardson, Kitcher andGoldman by showing how CCE engages with the 'real world' of science, captures what isdistinctive about scientific evidence, makes proper use of liberal democratic principles andavoids dogmatism. In the remainder of the dissertation, I draw upon my version of CCE in orderto identify and critically evaluate assumptions underlying standards of evidence in medicine andto suggest and evaluate possible alternatives.4.3. Chapter Three: Evidence-based MedicineProponents of the evidence-based medicine movement have established current standards ofmedical evidence.25 I take great care in this dissertation to represent EBM as accurately aspossible. Straw-man critiques of EBM are commonplace, and it is not my intention to provideanother critique of this type nor am I interested in developing a polemic against EBM. I am moreinterested in understanding the philosophical implications - the strengths and limitations - of theEBM approach. This involves charitably reading the statements of EBM proponents and, wherepossible, identifying elements of EBM that are vital to the future of medicine and worthmaintaining. Toward this end, I begin with a historical survey of the EBM movement, from itsorigins in clinical epidemiology at McMaster University in the early 1990s to its current status asthe model for medical research and medical practice in health-care systems worldwide. I then 24 Longino, Science as Social Knowledge.25 Evidence Based Medicine Working Group, \"Evidence-based Medicine: A new approach to teaching the practiceof medicine\"; Sackett et al. \"Evidence-based Medicine: What it is and what it isn't.\"13isolate and describe the central elements of the most recent version of EBM. Finally, I identifythe core background assumptions of the EBM movement - what, at least ostensibly, makes EBMdifferent from any other kind of medicine.4.4. Chapter Four: Critiquing the Background Assumptions of Evidence-basedMedicine: Part IAccording to the version of CCE I defend in Chapter Two, the most insidious sources of bias inscientific research are background assumptions. In this chapter I critique two of the backgroundassumptions of EBM: the assumption that medical practice should be \"more scientific\" and theassumption that evidence from clinical research (rather than authority or pathophysiology)should form the basis of medical decision-making. With respect to the first assumption, I arguethat the characterization of science underlying the drive to make medical research more scientificis narrow and inaccurate. In addition, scientific approaches to medical practice have not yet beenshown to provide better patient outcomes. Further, medical practice is committed to principles ofshared decision-making and individualized care which are in tension with the demands ofscience as characterized. With respect to the second assumption, I argue that while clinicalresearch evidence was meant to replace authority in medical decision-making it has become anew form of authority, and that pathophysiologic reasoning, and for that matter, a number ofother factors, are as 'basic' to medical decision-making as research evidence.4.5. Chapter Five: Critiquing the Background Assumptions of Evidence-basedMedicine: Part IIThe critique of background assumptions continues in Chapter Five, where I evaluate theassumption that a hierarchy of evidence is necessary to guide medical research and practice.EBM is distinguished from traditional approaches to medical decision-making by the centralposition accorded to the evidence hierarchy. In light of the variety of possible evidencehierarchies, the particular version offered by EBM needs to be justified. Advocates of EBM havenot been forthcoming on this issue. In this chapter I reconstruct possible justifications for thecurrent version of the hierarchy. According to my analysis, the evidence hierarchy defines best14evidence as that which is: precise, randomized, unbiased, quantified and relatively certain. Icritically evaluate each of these characterizations of good evidence and consider whether theycan provide justification for the evidence hierarchy. I argue not only that this particular hierarchyis unjustified, but further that any attempt to hierarchically rank research methods is incoherentsince it amounts to an unjustified restriction of medical knowledge.4.6. Chapter Six: The Future of Evidence-based Medicine: Diversity and Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative MedicineThe remainder of the dissertation outlines structural changes that could be made to improve thestandards of evidence used by medical researchers. According to my version of CCE, diverseperspectives are needed in order to ensure active critical debate in knowledge-productivecommunities. In the first section of this chapter, I argue that EBM contributes to a restriction onmethodological and theoretical diversity within medicine. In order to demonstrate the value ofdiverse perspectives, and the importance of responsiveness to such perspectives in medicine, Ioutline recent developments in complementary and alternative medical research. While some ofthe research conducted by researchers in complementary and alternative medicine is of poorquality, and is rightly dismissed by the mainstream research community, this is not always thecase. Using specific examples, I show how innovations proposed by alternative medicalresearchers could be of significant value to the mainstream medical community. Theseinnovations include new, more patient-centered outcome measures and novel forms of the RCT.Furthermore, the insistence of complementary and alternative medical researchers on the valueof underused but highly ranked research methods (such as the n-of-1) as well as lower-rankedresearch methods provides an indication of the way in which standards of evidence could berestructured non-hierarchically.4.7. Chapter Seven: The Future of Evidence-based Medicine: Interactive Objectivityand the Open Science MovementIn the final chapter I take a closer look at the claims to objectivity made by EBM proponents. Idraw upon a recent philosophical catalogue of objectivity proposed by Heather Douglas in order15to characterize the sense(s) of objectivity implicitly and explicitly assumed by proponents ofEBM. 26 I raise some concerns about the potential dangers of relying exclusively on these sensesof objectivity. I argue that an over-reliance on procedural objectivity has led proponents of EBMto the false belief that methods alone (narrowly construed) can secure objectivity, and also to therelated and even more problematic belief that guidelines produced on the basis of the evidencehierarchy provide an objective basis for medical decisions. Finally, I draw upon the CCE accountof interactive objectivity in order to suggest ways in which standards of evidence might beimproved. I provide a detailed account of interactive objectivity and outline the sorts ofinterventions in medical research and practice required by such an account, including:elimination of confidentiality agreements signed by researchers, disclosure of competinginterests in publications, prohibition on ghost authorships, public registration of research, openpeer review, open access to publications, open submission processes, increased public funding ofresearch, less reliance on guidelines, greater awareness of the collective nature of medicaldecisions and, most importantly, greater analytic training for medical professionals.5. Aim of the DissertationThe overall aim of this dissertation is not to specify a rigid set of requirements for standards ofmedical evidence, or worse, to offer a formalized and over-simplified process for the evaluationof research methods. This would repeat the mistakes made by the proponents of EBM. Instead, Idraw upon the resources of critical contextual empiricism to evaluate current standards ofevidence and to propose means for improving not only the content of standards of medicalevidence as they exist today, but the process of producing and defending such standards in thefuture. This project is advanced with an awareness of my position as an outsider to the medicalcommunity, and with the sincere hope that my arguments will be critiqued and ameliorated bymedically-inclined philosophers and philosophically-inclined medical professionals in the future.While the EBM movement has brought about many welcome changes in medicine, including agreater focus on the need to provide explicit reasons for treatment decisions and a more criticalattitude toward traditional forms of authority, it has important epistemological shortcomings. Iargue that the standards of evidence proposed by EBM enable and even encourage false and 26 Douglas, 453.16potentially dangerous illusions of objectivity and certainty within medicine. The standards divertattention from alternative viable and valuable sources of evidence, thereby distorting medicalresearch and practice as well as medical knowledge generally.17Chapter OneSocial EpistemologyTraditional epistemologists examine the necessary and sufficient conditions for individualknowledge. Social epistemologists expand this project to include investigations into the socialdimension of knowledge.1 In this chapter I define social epistemology and offer reasons tosupport the expansion of the domain of epistemology to social issues. I then delineate and defenda set of criteria for a good social epistemology. A good social epistemological theory: focuseson justification, preserves individualistic intuitions, provides mechanisms for managing socialvalues and offers a robust account of the sociality of knowledge. On the basis of these criteria, Inarrow the options down to one: critical contextual empiricism. Finally, I clarify the relationshipbetween feminist, social and naturalized epistemology. This chapter serves as a foundation forthe detailed description and expansion of critical contextual empiricism offered in Chapter Two.1. Individual and Social EpistemologyEpistemology is the study of knowledge: more specifically it is the study of justified true belief.2The starting point for traditional epistemology has been the Cartesian query, what can I know?Thus, the basis for most epistemological investigations has been the individual - and not just anyindividual, but a particular conception of a radically isolated, unattached and disembodiedindividual.3 Attention is generally focused on solving problems associated with individualbeliefs, usually related to the fallibility of various psychological faculties. This focus has shifted,though this does not mean that epistemologists are no longer theorizing about individuals. 1 Of course, there is no consensus on the precise scope of 'social' or 'knowledge'. The scope of these concepts willbe discussed in greater detail below.2 Contemporary analytic epistemologists regard this as provisionally established, though it is known to have certainshortcomings (the infamous Gettier problems). Supplemental criteria or a reconceptualization of truth and/orjustification may be necessary in order to overcome such problems. Knowledge as justified true belief has also beendisputed by other communities, notably postmodern theorists. I will not be discussing these foundational debatesfurther in this dissertation as they are the subject of considerable attention elsewhere.3 This characterization of trends in individualistic epistemology may not extend perfectly to ancient and medievalphilosophy, since during those periods epistemology was not demarcated as a distinct field of philosophy in the wayit is today. The epistemological projects that were pursued often addressed metaphysical and other problemsconcurrently, and tended to have varied characterizations of the individual subject.18Rather, the scope of epistemology has broadened as attention to the conditions for socialknowledge increased over the past three decades. Social epistemology, then, is the study of thesocial conditions of knowledge and knowledge-production. I am sympathetic with scholars whodescribe the shift toward social epistemology as \"long overdue.\"4All social epistemologists share a commitment to studying the social dimensions ofknowledge. They differ significantly, however, in their views about how this investigationshould proceed. Roughly, the difference is as follows.5 Classical social epistemologists believethat social epistemology is an extension of individualistic epistemology, and that investigationinto the social dimensions of knowledge can be a fruitful addition to traditional projects.Advocates aim to correct for the overly individualistic tendencies of traditional epistemology.They retain a commitment to truth and/or justification and so are able to engage with thetraditional canon in epistemology. On the other hand, anti-classical social epistemologists seethe new field as a replacement for the misguided (not merely incomplete) enterprise of traditionalepistemology. Advocates of anti-classical social epistemology focus on the contextualdifferences that shape different communities of knowers; they tend to discount the need fordiscussions about truth and justification, preferring instead to focus on belief-forming practices.62. Social Epistemology2.1. Past and PresentAlthough the social dimensions of knowledge have occasionally merited attention from thephilosophers of the traditional canon, the first systematic exploration of issues in socialepistemology didn't occur until the 1970s. The term social epistemology, first proposed byMargaret Egan, referred to \"the study of knowledge in society\", with a focus on \"the production,flow, integration, and consumption of all forms of communicated thought throughout the entire 4 Kitcher, \"The Naturalists Return,\" 114.5 This distinction is a bit crude, but serves as a basic division of the domain. It is crude because social constructivistsand others in the anti-classical camp might still be characterized as offering accounts of truth and justification - it isjust that the accounts they offer are highly relativistic and/or naturalized. Goldman's distinction here probably hasmore to do with the proximity of accounts of truth and justification to traditional accounts of the concepts.6 Goldman, \"Social Epistemology.\"19social fabric.\"7 The term was adopted into the literature in the social sciences (particularly inscience and technology studies) and has gained a certain degree of notoriety there in recentyears.8 The versions of social epistemology advanced by social scientists have (unsurprisingly)tended to be descriptive - they have been more concerned with the relationship between powerand knowledge in contemporary scientific communities than the ideal conditions for theproduction of social knowledge.9 In what follows, I will focus on the philosophical approaches tosocial epistemology. This burgeoning field contains both classical and anti-classical socialepistemologists. The creation, in 2004, of Episteme, a journal dedicated to publishing research inanalytic social epistemology, as well as several recent social epistemology conferences attendedby highly regarded analytic epistemologists, seems to indicate a general acceptance of the fieldthat was not present even a decade ago. More philosophers are recognizing the importance ofnormative philosophical work in an area traditionally dominated by sociologists and scholars inscience and technology studies. Add to this the convergence between feminist and socialepistemologists and the community is experiencing a significant amount of growth.2.2. Reasons for Social EpistemologyAn epistemological theory that neglects the social dimensions of knowledge is incomplete. Italso fails to provide guidance on the ideal structure and organization of knowledge-productivecommunities. Many epistemologists have recognized the importance of examining the socialaspects of knowledge-production. There are four reasons why greater attention to these issues iswarranted. Social epistemology is: 1) helpful for understanding testimonial knowledge; 2)responsive to the practice of knowledge-production; 3) fruitful for understanding the status ofexpertise; and 4) able to solve otherwise intractable problems caused by the presence of socialvalues in inquiry. I will provide support for each of these claims below.First, we might care about the social elements of knowledge because we want tounderstand testimonial evidence. From the moment we begin to understand language, we learn a 7 Shera, 86.8 Steve Fuller, professor of sociology at Warwick University and author of one of the first texts on socialepistemology, has been widely criticized for taking the stand as an expert witness in support of intelligent design,http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/profile/story/0,,1698284,00.html9 For a survey of the views represented in contemporary social epistemology see Alvin Goldman's Knowledge in aSocial World, 69-79 and Pathways to Knowledge: Private and Public, 139-204.20great deal through the testimony of our caregivers. The question of whose testimony we shouldtrust is thus an important one. Traditional (individualistic) epistemologists have for some timerecognized the value of philosophical work on testimony (Hume, for instance, offered acompelling argument for distrusting testimony). This has been the thin edge of the social wedgein epistemology, so to speak. Issues of testimonial knowledge require that traditionalepistemologists refocus their attention on the social character of some aspects of knowledgeproduction. For instance, when should we believe the testimony of a medical professional orbioethicist? What about the testimony of a media reporter avowing the health benefits of a newdrug? Or the testimony of patients in an online chat group? Given that a significant portion ofour knowledge seems to come to us this way, this is an important question for epistemologists.Epistemological theorizing on testimony attends to the dynamics of interaction between andamong individuals. This is sometimes classified as a weak form of social epistemology. Itprovides a starting point for further, more robust social investigations. The remaining threereasons address these more ambitious, and more interesting, projects.Second, investigations into social features of knowledge-production allowepistemologists to understand and explain the function of social conventions already in use inparadigmatic knowledge-productive communities, such as scientific communities. Building onthis, such investigations also allow epistemologists to modify these social features so as toimprove knowledge production. Science is a good example of a social knowledge-producingenterprise. The education of scientists is social, scientific ideas and instruments are shared, andscientists work in networks and communities. Science requires by its nature the presence of twoor more individuals. Certain structural and inherently social features of scientific communitiesenhance the production of knowledge. These include scholarly meetings and conferences,congresses, seminars, round-tables and workshops, as well as journals (peer-reviewed andotherwise), requirements that researchers perform literature reviews before beginning a project(in order to link work to related work that was done in the past), third-party attempts to replicateresearch, public lectures, forums for interdisciplinary work, and many other specializedmechanisms in particular areas of science (for instance, grand rounds in medicine). These areimportant elements of scientific inquiry: they provide an opportunity for critical debate andoutside evaluation of research, as well as an opportunity to disseminate research within thecommunity in order to trigger new ideas. Since these social conditions can be arranged in better21or worse ways, social epistemologists argue that attention to the social conditions of knowledgecannot be ignored in the construction of a comprehensive epistemological theory. Socialepistemologies are more comprehensive than individualistic epistemologies because theyincorporate normative standards that guide the interaction of individuals as members ofcommunities.Failure to attend to the social structures inherent in knowledge production can lead toproblems. Imagine a scientific community organized in a way that prevents critical dialogueamong community members. Such a community would likely limit the publication anddistribution of research, ensure secrecy by limiting the presentation of material at conferencesand other public events, and encourage individual scientists to pursue projects without significantcollaboration or assistance from others in their own or other disciplines. The number of journals,conferences, public lectures and collaborative projects would be significantly less than what wesee in science today. We take for granted that the features of scientific communities we havetoday are well suited to the production of knowledge. But on what grounds do we make thisclaim? Unless we engage in discussion about why some structural features (such as criticaldebate) are epistemically valuable, we will not be able to justify our choice of one of thesecommunities over the other. When forces outside of science, such as those representing powerfuleconomic interests, demand changes to scientific communities such as rules of confidentiality inresearch, it is social epistemological arguments that justify resistance.10Third, the investigation of social factors in knowledge-production may be fruitful forother problems we face in the scientific realm. The status of experience and expertise as reliablegrounds for knowledge is a persistent concern in many areas of science. In medicine, forinstance, the expertise of physicians was traditionally one of the most highly sought-after sourcesof knowledge. In the medical literature today many of the critics of evidence-based medicine(EBM) decry the loss of the art of clinical judgement and individual expertise. They argue thatEBM is driven by a desire to bypass individual expertise and experience, and ultimatelyphysician judgement, because such judgement is seen as idiosyncratic and prone to error.Understanding what value should be placed on the expertise of individual physicians will requireattention to the ways in which expertise and experience are established within the medicalcommunity, and will ultimately require the attention of social epistemologists. 10 I discuss these issues further in Chapter Seven.22Fourth, we need to pay attention to the social factors in science because we will then havethe resources to resolve one of the big questions in science today: what role should social valuesplay in scientific inquiry?11 Values are pervasive in scientific inquiry. Scientists need tounderstand what to do about this state of affairs. As extensive research in sociology and scienceand technology studies over the past half century indicates, social values are pervasive in sciencefrom macro-level political and economic forces to the micro-level decisions made by individualresearchers.12 On the macro-scale, to use a popular example, massive government andcommercial investment in scientific research following World War II (for instance, in theManhattan project, the Apollo project, and the RADAR project) led to the era of \"Big Science\".This changed the character of science: projects became much larger and the number of scientistsworking on particular teams expanded. As many historians have shown, this impacted not onlythe content of science (since research money was directed to projects likely to advance nationaland commercial interests) but the practice of science, as scientists no longer had independentcontrol, or in some cases even understood, the data they produced.13 Similar social values, forinstance those driving the recent Human Genome Project, are thought to influence science today.On the micro-level, sociologists and anthropologists have demonstrated that individualscientists make dozens of 'small' decisions in the course of research. These seeminglyinsignificant decisions can have influence what aspects of the data are found \"most interesting\"and pursued, which are declared \"successful,\" and how the data are presented in publication (forinstance, data are often presented in ways that downplay the active role of the researcher).14Social epistemologists aim to offer accounts of knowledge-production that reflect our currentunderstanding of the role of values in science without deferring to those who would suggest that,because values are ineliminable in inquiry, scientific investigations do not get at anythingmeaningful or real. Similarly, they refuse to defer to those who suggest that values can beisolated and extracted from scientific inquiry. Instead, social epistemologists exploit the sociality 11 I will explain the nature of social values in Chapter Two. For now it will suffice to note that values can benegative or positive.12 See Brown's Who Rules in Science for a discussion on the various ways in which values permeate science, and foran overview of the famous cases of the past two decades. According to Brown, values are beliefs that are notempirically testable. The term \"values\" is used broadly here to refer to both epistemic and non-epistemic values or,in Longino's terminology, constitutive and contextual values. The primary concern has been with the negativeinfluence of contextual (or social) values on science. This distinction is discussed further in the next chapter.13 Shapin and Schaffer's Leviathan and the Air Pump is an excellent investigation of the ways in which large scaleinstitutional and professional interests influence science.14 Knorr-Cetina.23of science in order to solve what are otherwise intractable problems. In particular, socialepistemologists are able to find middle ground between the two extremes in the science wars andpropose a constructive role for values in science.15 This is a significant achievement and providessupport for further research into social epistemology.3. Criteria for Choosing a Theory Within Social EpistemologyIn the Introduction I explained my reasons for using a particular epistemological framework forthe critical project of this dissertation. In order to proceed with this project as outlined, I mustidentify the best social epistemological theory. To begin, I advance a set of criteria for a goodsocial epistemology, and explain and defend the criteria. My development and articulation ofthese criteria reflects my commitment to finding a social epistemology that is robustly social yetwhich recognizes the value of explaining our most basic intuitions about individual knowledge.These criteria also indicate my commitment to honouring promises to deal with the problem ofsocial values in knowledge-production (as noted above in the justifications for socialepistemology generally). Once I explain and defend the criteria, I use them in my assessment ofthe available social epistemological theories.First, the theory must explicitly address issues of justification. Jaegwon Kim explains thefocus on justification in epistemology by noting that,Neither belief nor truth is a specifically epistemic notion: belief is a psychologicalconcept and truth a semantical-metaphysical one. These concepts may have an implicitepistemological dimension, but if they do, it is likely to be through their involvementwith essentially normative epistemic notions like justification, evidence and rationality.16In order to justify our beliefs we must be able to provide reasons for them. We must offer goodreasons to think that our beliefs are true (or meaningfully true, or conform to reality, or whateverpluralistic goal we have set). Kim goes on to explain how it is that the element of justificationbrings normativity to epistemology, 15 A more detailed examination of these issues is offered in Chapter Two.16 Kim, 383.24Justification is what makes knowledge itself a normative concept... If a belief is justifiedfor us, then it is permissible and reasonable, from an epistemic point of view, for us tohold it and it would be epistemically irresponsible to hold beliefs that contradict it. If weconsider believing or accepting a proposition to be an 'action' in an appropriate sense,belief justification would then be a special case of justification of action, which in itsbroadest terms is the central concern of normative ethics.17My interest is in normative social epistemological theories. Because this project is a criticalevaluation of current standards of medical evidence, and because I aim to provide constructivesuggestions on the improvement of these standards, it is important that the social epistemologicaltheory I draw upon be normative. As mentioned in the introduction, this is not a social scientificproject, and my aim is only descriptive insofar as accurate description contributes to a moreaccurate critical analysis. As Kim points out, a focus on justification is necessary to bring out thenormative dimension of an epistemological project. As a result, I will be interested in socialepistemological theories that offer a detailed account of epistemic justification.The second criterion is that the social epistemological theory preserves our individualisticintuitions. In other words, I am interested in a classical social epistemological theory. It ispossible to recognize the importance of the social features of knowledge-production withoutdenying that individuals can have knowledge and throwing out hundreds of years of traditionalindividualistic epistemology. I trust that it will not take too much effort to convince the readerthat individuals can have knowledge since that has been the starting assumption of epistemologyfor thousands of years. While the inclusion of social features in our accounts of knowledgeexpands the project of epistemology into new domains, this should not mean the wholesalerejection of all important advances in traditional epistemology. The attribution of primaryknowledge to individuals is a critical component of a good social epistemology. I am committedto retaining this component. Holistic accounts of communities as \"super-entities,\" or as the onlysubjects of knowledge, will fail this criterion.18Third, the social epistemological theory must provide mechanisms for managing socialvalues. It should be able to tell us whether, for instance, secrecy is a good social value when itcomes to producing knowledge. One of the strengths of social epistemology outlined earlier is 17 Ibid.18 Some social epistemological theories attribute belief-states to communities. Because beliefs have traditionallybeen attributed to only to individuals (with minds), the claim that communities have beliefs seems to imply thatthere is some super-entity, or collective being, to which beliefs are being attributed.25that it is an area of epistemology well positioned to offer solutions to the question of what to dowith social values in inquiry. A theory that failed to do so would weaken the support offered forpursuing social epistemology in the first place. Because most social epistemologists do at leastattempt to solve this problem, I am particularly interested in theories that offer detailed, practicalmechanisms, where those mechanisms are well-defended.Fourth, and last, the theory should offer a robust social account of justification. That is,the theory should have a comprehensive account of the relationship between the social and therational.19 This requirement acts as a counterpoint to the second criterion: while the secondcriterion ensures a theory is not too social this criterion ensures that it is, still, robustly social.Epistemologists have traditionally been interested in the psychological faculties thought to leadto reliable beliefs. While desires, emotions, prejudices and imagination have been critiqued asunreliable bases for belief-formation, the traditional list of good sources includes: introspection,memory, perception, reason and (sometimes) testimony.20 So, for instance, beliefs based onperception are encouraged since they more reliably lead to knowledge than beliefs based onimagination. Social epistemologists suggest that we need not limit ourselves to psychological(i.e. individualistic) factors when we identify the reliable faculties that are available to us. In fact,this is already partially recognized by the inclusion of testimony as a reliable source upon whichto form beliefs about the world.If we examine the knowledge-productive processes common in the sciences we can seethe possibility for further socializing our understanding of both perception (observation) andreason (and maybe, with recent developments in the cognitive sciences, memory).21 Philosophersof science usually describe perception (observation) and reasoning as the core elements ofscientific practice. That is to say that observation and reasoning are generally accepted to beknowledge-productive practices. Deductive-nomological models of scientific explanation, forinstance, draw on assumptions about the ideal relationship between the products of reason(theories) and empirical observations. In practice, attention to the sociality of knowledge will 19 Traditionally, social mechanisms were thought of as non-rational or even irrational. A theory that provides anunderstanding of the rationality of certain social processes moves beyond this traditional dichotomy. Such a theorywill also suggest ways in which faculties traditionally thought to be free of social influence are actually dependenton social factors. See Longino, The Fate of Knowledge, for a detailed discussion of the relationship between therational and the social.20 Steup.21 The socialization of observation and reasoning are discussed below. Work in the cognitive sciences andphilosophy of mind on \"external memory\" seems promising as well. See for instance Olick and Robbins.26require that the account not be limited to explanations of testimony. While testimonialknowledge is a significant 'gateway' topic into social epistemology, theories that stop there failto take the challenge of sociality seriously. Robust understandings of the sociality of observationand reasoning are a critical component of a comprehensive social epistemology.224. Applying the CriteriaI will now use these criteria to narrow down the available options with which we are presented.In doing so I offer a cursory evaluation of some of the most prominent social epistemologicaltheories, including those offered by Goldman, Anderson, (Miranda) Fricker, Latour, Kukla,Fuller, Nelson, Solomon, Cody, (Elizabeth) Fricker, Burge, Foley, Lackey and Longino.23 I arguethat Longino's account best meets all four criteria.4.1. Focus on Epistemic JustificationAnti-classical social epistemologies fail my first criterion because, by definition, they fail toengage with questions of epistemic justification. This means that theories by Bruno Latour,Andre Kukla, and Steve Fuller, among others, are set aside. Advocates of classical approaches tosocial epistemology tend to divide down two lines: those interested in the social conditions oftruth, and those interested in the social conditions of justification. Most social epistemologistsfocus solely on one or the other of these concepts. As outlined above, social epistemologicalapproaches that incorporate social accounts of justification will be of particular interest in thisdissertation. This does not preclude the eventual consistency of such accounts with truth-orientedsocial epistemologies (such as Alvin Goldman's 'veritism', and veritistic theories offered byElizabeth Anderson and Miranda Fricker).24 Bringing the two elements of classical socialepistemology together is an important project, but not one developed here. 22 As we will see in the next chapter, it is this robust account of the sociality of observation and reasoning that willprovide the grounds for solving the 'problem' of values in science.23 I must stress the cursory nature of these evaluations. It would take several dissertations to address all of thesetheories in detail, and the focus of this dissertation is elsewhere.24 Goldman's veritistic theory of social epistemology has now been fully developed in the well-regarded treatiseKnowledge in a Social World in 1999. Goldman is also the editor of the new journal Episteme: A Journal of SocialEpistemology, which publishes articles in classical social epistemology.274.2. Preservation of Individualistic IntuitionsThe second criterion is that the theory must preserve our individualistic intuitions.25 It mustpermit the attribution of knowledge to individuals, though it may socialize the process leading toknowledge. In order to understand the position of social epistemologists on individualknowledge, it is first important to ask, what is distinctly social about social epistemology?Responses to this question can be grouped into two categories: those that argue for the existenceof collective entities and those that argue for greater attention to inter-individual relationships.26 Iwill outline the two most common positions on the nature of the social in what follows.4.2.1. Collective EntitiesAdvocates of the broadest definition of the social suggest that collective entities such ascommunities, groups and teams are capable of contributing to inquiry as a unit (not merely asindividuals together, or as individuals-in-communities, but as a new entity). Thus we speak ofCatholic beliefs, the doubts or convictions of juries, the actions of corporations, and so on.27There is significant debate about the details of this understanding of the social including, amongother things, whether all or merely some knowledge is a collective product. This understandingdoes seem, at the very least, to require the attribution of belief-like qualities to new collectiveentities or super-entities. But this raises a number of challenges, one of which is: how can we 25 Anti-classical social epistemologist will also fail this second criterion.26 Very weak accounts of the social, which focus only on the role of social interests, are not the focus here. In suchaccounts, social interests have tended to be contrasted with rational interests, and so attention to social elements ofknowledge in philosophy has been largely restricted to accounts of problematic social interests (biases) and ways ofeliminating such interests. The idea is that we need to pay attention to social interests only insofar as we need tocreate mechanisms for eliminating them from inquiry. The focus of such mechanisms is on controlling the interestsof individuals. This (weak) sense of 'social' in epistemology is really just an aspect of traditional epistemology, withsome concern about corrupting social influences on individuals and individual mechanisms for limiting thesecorruptions. This understanding of 'social' allows individuals to produce knowledge regardless of their relationshipto any other individuals, and independent of their membership in any particular community, as long as they havedevised mechanisms for limiting the influence of social interests on their reasoning. As such it remains veryindividualistic.27 Goldman uses a quote by Sandy Berger, former National Security Advisor in the United States Government, tomake this point: \"We've learned since 9/11 that not only did we not know what we didn't know, but the F.B.I. didn'tknow what it did know.\" The F.B.I, as an integrated collective entity, didn't know what many of its individualmembers knew (i.e. that terrorists were engaging in flight training in the United States). In this example, thecollective entity is attributed beliefs that are not only distinct from those of its constituent members, but actually inopposition to many of those beliefs. Goldman, \"Social Epistemology.\"28attribute beliefs to collectives when beliefs have traditionally only been attributed to individuals?Determining the appropriate ontological status of a collective mind is particularly problematic. Ido not have the space to address the details of this problem here. Instead, I will provide a quickexample of the sort of account that runs into this problem.Lynn Hankinson-Nelson's holistic feminist empiricism draws upon Quine's web ofknowledge to suggest that evidence achieves its status from its relationship to other elements ofthe web of knowledge (other values, hypotheses, theories, reasons, and empirical observations).Knowledge is produced by the community and the community, as a sort of holistic entity, is whatcan be said to know. Individual knowledge only follows as a consequence of communityknowledge (individuals have derivative knowledge only). This account has a very strong sense ofthe social - going so far as to suggest that it is only communities that have primary knowledge.This erases, or at least seriously limits, the individual subject, and marks a significant departurefrom traditional epistemology. This means that Nelson's social epistemology is too social by thecriteria outlined above.4.2.2. Inter-individual RelationshipsIn contrast to this holistic account, more conservative accounts of the social attend to theinteractions and relationships among individuals. Advocates of attending to these inter-individualrelationships argue that we need not focus only at the individual level or the community level. Inbetween these two are the interactions that occur among individuals in communities. It ispossible to develop rules, principles and social structures to govern these interactions. As aresult, individuals are credited with knowledge (there is no need to posit any further entities), butthey only achieve knowledge as a result of relationships they have with other individuals. Whilethis position is consistent with the claim that individuals can have knowledge, it does not allowindividuals to be described as self-sufficient producers of knowledge. Individuals know, but theyonly know as members of communities.28 Social epistemologists of this type specify conditionsfor the organization of knowledge-productive communities. Individuals in a particularcommunity produce knowledge to the extent that their community meets the normative criteria.A good social epistemology will conceive of the social in the manner just described. As 28 Heidi Grasswick develops this idea in her essay, \"Individuals-in-Communities.\"29mentioned above, social epistemological theories that posit collective entities fail the secondcriterion.4.3. Mechanisms for Managing Social ValuesA successful social epistemological theory will provide mechanisms for addressing the role ofsocial values in inquiry. Miriam Solomon's social empiricism attempts to provide suchmechanisms. Solomon's theory is social because scientific rationality is \"socially emergent\" andempirical because it is focused on empirical success.29 In keeping with the naturalist tradition,Solomon proposes to examine the production of empirically successful theories in science usingempirical methods. Solomon suggests that \"decision-vectors\" (all factors which may influence adecision, whether positively or negatively) must be appropriately distributed within acommunity.30 She divides influences on science into empirical decision-vectors (those that areconnected to empirical success, for example, salience and novelty of predictions) and non-empirical decision-vectors (for example, ideology and peer pressure) and assigns weights toeach. Scientific inquiry produces knowledge when the empirical decision-vectors are distributedequitably and non-empirical decision-vectors are distributed equally. Her account is distinctive inthat it proposes a modified quantitative approach for balancing empirical and non-empiricalfactors in scientific inquiry. Her account also has a central role for rationality. Solomon arguesfor the importance of empirical success as a criterion of rationality, since empirical success isthought to be an indicator of truth. Communities are rational when they use empirical success asa measure for adopting or rejecting theories. Individuals are offered some credit on this account(preserving some of our intuition that individuals can have knowledge), in that they can holdbeliefs that differ from those of the communities in which they are situated. Rationality isattributed to the community and to individuals, and the two can come apart. By the criteriaoutlined so far, Solomon's account might seem promising.Unfortunately, Solomon's account encounters serious problems when it comes to thedetails. In particular, it has been extremely difficult to identify appropriate mechanisms fordistributing decision-vectors - particularly while remaining naturalistic. Solomon's desire to 29 Solomon, Social Empiricism, 12, 120.30 Ibid., 53.30remain a naturalist is complicated by a number of clearly normative claims (such as principle ofequity and equality underlying the distribution of decision-vectors). Unfortunately, the desire topreserve a naturalistic framework while making normative rules forces her to make someelaborate and unpersuasive claims that, as Psillos puts it, \"[verge] on incoherence.\"31 There arealso concerns about the attribution of rationality at the community level (similar to the concernsraised about Nelson's view). In addition, criteria for identifying decision vectors are regrettablyabsent from her account. As a result, her assertions regarding the number of decision-vectors in aparticular historical case seem arbitrary. Finally, one wonders how necessary (and how practical)the quantified approach to balancing empirical and non-empirical factors really is.Social epistemologists should provide mechanisms for managing social values, andSolomon attempts to do so. Her choice of mechanism, however, raises more questions than itanswers. How are we to properly assign value to empirical and non-empirical factors? Whathappens if we purposely weight non-empirical factors differently in order to achieve outcomeswe desire? Does it make sense to weight all empirical factors equally - are accuracy andfruitfulness always equally valuable? Does it make sense to weight all non-empirical factorsequally - is political ideology comparable to religious devotion? Finally, how robust is thedistinction between empirical and non-empirical factors? It has been the contention of manyscience studies scholars that the distinction between so-called epistemic and non-epistemicfactors cannot be upheld. Similar concerns seem likely regarding empirical and non-empiricalfactors. In light of the challenges faced by Solomon's account, particularly the lack of practicaland defensible mechanisms for managing social values, this social epistemological theory failsmy third criterion.4.4. Robust Relationship between the Rational and the SocialI am looking for an account of knowledge that preserves our individualistic intuitions whileensuring a robust account of the relationship between the social and the rational. This is adelicate balance. There are a number of classical social epistemologists working on thejustifications for testimonial evidence, including C.A.J. Coady, Elizabeth Fricker, Tyler Burge,Richard Foley and Jennifer Lackey. What is surprising is that this focus on the justifications 31 Psillos, 546. Another (largely negative) review is provided by Klee.31offered for testimony is not extended to other information-gathering faculties such as observationand reasoning. I would classify these accounts of justification as only weakly social because theyneglect the potential sociality of these other faculties.32 Robust theories will have to consider adeeper sociality. Explicit discussion of the sociality of observation and reasoning is required.Among the accounts of justification offered by classical social epistemologists, the prominenttheories with what I will call a robust commitment to the social are: critical contextualempiricism (Helen Longino), social empiricism (Miriam Solomon), and feminist empiricism(Lynn Hankinson Nelson). These prominent epistemological theories have an integrationistproject with respect to the rational and the social.33 Of these, we have already rejected Nelsonand Solomon (above) based on other criteria. Helen Longino is interested in whether observationand reasoning might be socialized, and whether this socialization strips them of their justificatorypower (she argues it does not). She is not suggesting that observation and reasoning are whollysocial, but rather that they have a social dimension. In doing so, she elevates her theory abovethose focused on testimony and offers a more robust social epistemology. In what follows I willoutline how Longino provides this more robust sociality. She does so by socializing observationand reasoning.4.4.1. ObservationThere are at least two ways in which observation is social, according to Longino. First,observation is not simple sense perception, but \"an organized sensory encounter that registerswhat is perceived in relation to categories, concepts, and classes that are socially produced. Bothordering and organization are (dependent on) social processes.\"34 The theory-ladenness ofobservation (that is, of concepts and apparatus) makes observation at least partly constituted byits theoretical context. This is a familiar claim in philosophy of science though Longinoidentifies an unfamiliar consequence of accepting observation as theory-laden: the socializationof cognition. Insofar as the community of knowers produces the concepts and apparatus 32 It may be the case that while these authors have focused on testimony they intend to expand the scope of theirclaims to other social features. In that case, I would be most interested to read what they have to say. My positionhere is that they do not go far enough, not that what they have done is wrong. It may turn out to be the case thatthese scholars develop excellent, more comprehensive, accounts in the future.33 That is, they attempt to integrate the two.34 Longino, The Fate of Knowledge, 100.32necessary to observation, observation is at least partly social. Decisions about which aspect of anobserved phenomenon is important, or what aspect should be observed at all, as well asprogressive debate over the proper interpretation of an observation, all occur among scientists.What counts as an observation, and then what counts as an observation worthy of attention, aredetermined by the community in which the observation is made.Second, observations must be stable across a variety of observers. Scientists are familiarwith the requirement that their experiments are reproducible by others. This criterion ofreproducibility, or repeatability, is grounded in assumptions about the fallibility of theobservations of individual scientists (in particular contexts, at particular times) and thus theimportance of outside access to research. Such a requirement aids scientists in determining thatthe observed regularity was not fraudulently created or unique to a particular setting, individual,or context. It is also meant to distinguish private knowledge that is not accessible to others (forinstance, divine revelation) from public knowledge (that which is accessible to any person underthe appropriate conditions). Science is the investigation of publicly accessible empiricalphenomena. Scientific experiments are publicly accessible, and requirements of reproducibilityprovide assurance that the phenomena is public and that scientists are observing the samephenomena.35 In sum, the claim that observation is social amounts to a claim that,[T]he status of the scientist's perceptual activity as observation depends on her relationswith others, in particular her openness to their challenge to and correction of herreports...[t]here is no way but the interaction of multiple perspectives to ascertain theobservational status of individual perceptions.36Longino is not suggesting that individuals cannot engage in experiments as individuals, ratherthat perceptions will only acquire the status of observations in light of particular conditions.4.4.2. Reason 35 A concern with this second claim is that scientists rarely bother to actually reproduce the experiments of others.This is evident in medicine, where large-scale RCTs are rarely repeated once they have been performed. In practice,it is often only the controversial results that are re-tested. For instance, research into alternative medical treatments isquite often subject to 're-confirmation' by different groups of investigators (this is particularly common withhomeopathy). This problem is usually addressed by claiming that it is the 'in principle' repeatability (not the actualrepeated observations) that matters.36 Ibid., 103.33The claim that reason is social gets to the core of Longino's position. She focuses onjustificatory reasoning as opposed to creative or constructive reasoning. This is importantbecause there is a difference between the process of creative reasoning, which I think Longinowould allow may often be entirely individual in nature, and justificatory reasoning, which is not.When Longino talks about justificatory reasoning, she means to include not only stereotypicalreasoning-as-thinking, but the act of providing justificatory reasons for one's beliefs. Thus it isnot thinking that is socialized (it is difficult to imagine what would that look like) but the act ofproviding justificatory reasons.37Drawing on work by Steward Cohen and David Annis, Longino argues that justificationis the practice of responding to objections. We see the rudiments of this position in the advice wegive to undergraduate philosophy students - \"once you've put forward your own position, besure to consider an objection and reply to it.\" No philosophy essay would be complete withoutthis hypothetical interrogation by a critical outsider. Whether the justification is successful or notwill depend on the community standards adopted in a particular context. If social rules governingthe appropriate forms of criticism play a role in this account of justification, it appears as thoughjustification is partly social. As Longino puts it, \"the critical dimension of cognition is a socialdimension\" and further, \"socializing cognition is not a corruption or displacement of the rationalbut a vehicle of its performance.\"38 Again, this does not deny the role of individuals as knowers.Longino is suggesting that while individuals form beliefs through individual reasoning processesthey only produce knowledge when that belief is justified - and justificatory reasoning is social.Individuals are said to have knowledge when their beliefs have survived critical interrogation byothers in their cognitive communities. In this sense, though individuals reason to conclusions, theproducts of that justificatory reasoning are only honoured with the title of knowledge whenexternal scrutiny has occurred.39 Of course we can all think, imagine and reason in our own 37 As Ian Hacking puts it: \"reasoning is not, as I understand it, a purely sedentary art. It includes a lot of doing, notjust arguing or thinking.\" Longino would add that the activity of reasoning is undertaken by communities ofindividuals and is thus not only active but interactive. Hacking, \"Statistical Language, Statistical Truth, andStatistical Reason,\" 138.38 Longino, The Fate of Knowledge, 106-7.39 There is a question here about the appropriate endpoint of inquiry. In line with Peirce, I believe we can neverknow we have reached knowledge because we can never be sure we have subjected our beliefs to sufficient criticalinterrogation.34minds, but we cannot call that knowledge until it has been publicly justified under the conditionsshe sets out.40 Longino uses a nice example to make this point. She says,Of course, Galileo and Newton and Darwin and Einstein were individuals ofextraordinary intellect, but what made their brilliant ideas knowledge were the processesof critical reception. Comparing the fate of their ideas with those of a thinker of arguablyequal intellectual power, Freud, demonstrates this.41Social factors are partly constitutive of, and serve to stabilize, knowledge. The socialization ofcognitive practices such as observation and reasoning forces us to recognize the interdependenceof individual subjects. Because normative rules can still be exercised on individuals and oncommunities, we are left not with empty relativism, but rather with a more robust account of thetypes of rules and practices that will have to be specified by a particular community in order forit to produce knowledge.5. Critical Contextual EmpiricismHelen Longino offers an account of epistemic justification. She argues that justification alwaysdraws upon assumptions, and in order to ensure that assumptions are not arbitrary, we need toensure that conditions for critical evaluation of assumptions are in place. These conditions aresocial - communities have to be sufficiently diverse, for instance. Longino's account yieldsindividual knowledge but insists that it must be produced intersubjectively (interactively withother individuals) to count as knowledge. Thus the community is important in the construction ofknowledge but at all times this is grounded in the interactions between individuals inrelationships with each other. There is no need to posit super-entities in order to have a novel andfruitful account of social factors in knowledge production. At the same time, Longino offers anaccount of the role of social factors in knowledge-production that incorporates sociality intorationality. This highly integrationist project has a robust role for the social, and so does not failto be a strong social epistemology. I will explain her approach, respond to criticisms, andidentify the key features that will be helpful in my evaluation of EBM in the next chapter. BeforeI do this, I will outline the relationship between Longino's critical contextual empiricism (CCE) 40 Details of these conditions are provided in Chapter Two.41 Ibid., 122. Emphasis in original.35and naturalized and feminist epistemologies, since Longino's account is often classified underthese other categories and because an understanding of how her account is situated will behelpful in the next chapter.5.1. Naturalized EpistemologyCCE builds on several trends in traditional epistemology in the last half century, notablyfallibilism, anti-foundationalism, pragmatism and naturalism. Of these, naturalism (in the formof reliabilism) is arguably the dominant philosophical position adopted by analyticepistemologists today.42 Naturalists hold a variety of positions, but are minimally committed tothe integration of psychology into epistemology and the rejection of a priori knowledge.43 Why,then, isn't Longino just a naturalized epistemologist? CCE is certainly influenced by naturalismto the extent that it takes seriously the workings of real scientists. But Longino is wary about awhole-hearted embrace of naturalism for a couple of reasons. First, naturalists tend to recreatethe same individualistic accounts of epistemology traditionally adopted by the philosophers ofthe canon. Naturalized epistemologies draw on work in cognitive science and psychology inorder to understand how individuals come to have knowledge. Longino wants more than this.She wants an epistemology that pays attention to the social factors influencing knowledge-production. This would require an expansion of the naturalist's project to include empirical workby, for instance, sociologists and anthropologists. This is not a conceptual impossibility, thoughit does go against the general tide.Second, and more pivotally, Longino is concerned that the naturalized epistemologieswill fail to have a strong normative dimension. And, fundamentally, feminist socialepistemologists such as Longino are not just concerned with identifying practices of oppression;they are interested in changing those practices. This strong political goal influences the choice ofepistemological framework. As Longino puts it, naturalism in epistemology \"presupposes thatwe know what we think we know and asks how.\"44 But it is not at all clear to feminists that weknow what we think we know. In fact, the work of science studies scholars indicates that, at leastsome of the time, we are misguided about what we think we know. Theories such as Longino's 42 Grasswick, thought to strike a delicate balance between an overly-descriptive (thus conservative) and possibly individualistic naturalism, and the needs of feministepistemologists as feminists concerned with emancipation and as social epistemologistsconcerned with interactions among agents. Of course, because the naturalistic landscape is morenuanced than ever before, it may be possible for feminist epistemologists to retain enough of thenormative dimensions of science while remaining weakly naturalistic. The details of thisnegotiation are an interesting area for further inquiry, though I will not address them here.5.2. Feminist EpistemologyFeminist epistemologies fail to fit the brutal caricatures often drawn of them by critics.Contemporary feminist epistemologies do not: essentialize women's intuitive and emotionalways of knowing, hold that a particular privileged viewpoint is held only by women, retreatuncritically into relativism, or support the wholesale rejection of rationality. ElizabethAnderson's fantastic review \"How not to criticize feminist epistemology\" has gone a long way to(finally) ending the straw-man arguments and beating of dead horses that passed for critiques offeminist epistemologies in the past.45 The traditional division of feminist epistemology into threecamps - empiricism, standpoint theory and postmodernism - was originally proposed by SandraHarding in 1986. Twenty-odd years later the distinctions are not as distinct, nor as helpful, asthey once were. In fact, there has been a great deal of convergence in feminist epistemology,with most theorists agreeing on core commitments to pluralism and rejection of the possibility ofa \"view from nowhere.\" Some differences remain, but many of these are merely products of thedifferent tools used in the different areas. Empiricists make use of analytic philosophy of science,standpoint theorists draw upon cultural theory, and postmodernists rely on literary theory. Inaddition, recent work by feminist pragmatists has added the tools of pragmatism to thislandscape. Standpoint theory has met with significant challenges in escaping the circularity of itsposition and in overcoming the bias paradox and feminist postmodernism fails to advancenormative prescriptions for the improvement of science. There has been a convergence onempiricist approaches in recent years. 45 Anderson, \"Review\"37Feminist empiricist epistemology is best described as a subset of social epistemology.Gender is a social category with similarities to other social categories (such as race and class). Afeminist epistemology that reflects contemporary feminist understandings of the links betweendifferent forms of oppression will be anxious to expand discussion to all social factors inaccounts of knowledge. The relationship between feminist and social epistemologists has been aproductive and interactive one, with many feminist epistemologists identifying as socialepistemologists and vice versa. The feminist character of much social epistemology is evident inthe critique of oppressive epistemological practices (through case studies and sociologicalinvestigations) - often related to gender. Feminists have traditionally valued interconnectednessover isolation, both politically and epistemologically, and this general tendency has also beenwell integrated with the project of social epistemology.46Longino describes what it means to be a feminist empiricist epistemologist. I will quoteher passage in full,To do epistemology as a feminist is to engage the questions of epistemology with anawareness of the ways in which participation in socially-sanctioned knowledgeproduction has been circumscribed, of the ways in which epistemological concepts likerationality and objectivity have been defined using notions of masculinity (and vice-versa), of the ways women have been derided as knowers, and of the need for alternativetheoretical approaches to satisfy feminist cognitive goals. It is to ask how epistemologyhas participated in or sanctioned these disbursements of privilege and opprobrium and toask whether the efforts to exclude women from knowledge generating activity has notalso resulted in the exclusion from the analysis of knowledge of traits and capacitiesassigned to women (a shrinking of the conception of knowledge.) What is important forthe feminine or the female here is the perspective it affords on the construction of theconcept of knowledge and the window it opens on alternatives. But it functions as anobject of reflection, not as a subject position.47To paraphrase, Longino suggests that the project is not to create a specifically feministepistemology but rather to do epistemology as a feminist - to think about the production ofknowledge with an eye to the ways in which epistemology may be related to practices ofoppression. This approach acknowledges the ways in which other forms of oppression (racismand classism, for instance) also influence knowledge-production. The key feature of the account 46 Grasswick, Webb, \"Feminist Epistemology as of Feminist Epistemology,\" 475.38is awareness - of any and all potentially harmful distortions of our understanding of knowers,knowledge-production, and knowledge.6. SummaryHelen Longino's critical contextual of epistemic justification thatpreserves individualistic intuitions while offering a robust account of the sociality of knowledge.CCE does not, unlike other more radical epistemological accounts, suggest that everything we'velearned in epistemology is useless because it is too de-contextualized, too objectified, and tooindividualistic. At the same time, the account is not shy in its critique of the ways in whichtraditional accounts neglected the social realm. But Longino does not just claim that individualscan justify beliefs to other individuals (as a limited focus on testimony might suggest); rather,she claims that justification just is a social process. In the next chapter I outline the key elementsof CCE and defend it against objections. I also propose new interpretations of key elements ofCCE. Once these arguments have been established, I proceed to my critical analysis ofevidence-based medicine.39Chapter TwoCritical Contextual EmpiricismTwo significant challenges to the traditional account of scientific inquiry arose in the twentiethcentury. The first was the argument that observations are theory-laden. The second was theargument that theories are underdetermined by data. Each of these claims was contrary to atraditional account of scientific methodology in which observations and reasoning were, amongother things, free from the influence of subjective values. The last half-century of scholarship inphilosophy of science and related fields has been marked by an attempt to come to grips with theproblem of inescapable subjectivity. Since the scientific method, as our most reliable producer ofknowledge, depends on its perceived impartiality for credibility, these two problems remaincentral to contemporary philosophy of science. In fact, the \"Science Wars\" of the past decadehave been largely a battle over the appropriate place of values in scientific inquiry.1In Science as Social Knowledge, Helen Longino develops an account of scientific inquirythat attempts to save science from the relativism of social constructivism while acknowledgingthe inescapability of subjective values in science. Longino suggests that it is possible toacknowledge the value-laden nature of all human inquiry without abandoning the possibility ofobjectivity. Scientific reasoning, she argues, is an active, value-laden practice, evidentialreasoning is context dependent and relies on background assumptions, and science is a socialinquiry that, at its best, produces social knowledge with contextual objectivity. Her proposal thatsocial interactions are necessary to the management of social values is familiar, drawing as itdoes on arguments from Mill, Pierce, and Popper, but also novel in providing a morecomprehensive theoretical framework than any of her predecessors. Longino takes seriously thesocial nature of knowledge as it is produced by scientists. She also discusses \"what a value-freescience might be, why it cannot be, and how we can avoid the paradoxes inherent in moretraditional accounts by treating scientific knowledge as social knowledge.\"2 This project iscontinued in her 2002 book The Fate of Knowledge. 1 Brown.2 Longino, Science as Social Knowledge, 15.40In what follows I identify the key elements of Longino's critical contextual empiricism(CCE), including her four CCE norms. I then develop modified versions of these norms in orderto make them more comprehensive and more specific. I also clarify Longino's position on thethree predicates of knowledge: content, agency, and warrant. Following this, I reply to a numberof objections to CCE raised by Miriam Solomon, Alan Richardson, Alvin Goldman and PhilipKitcher. I aim to offer a description and defence of the key elements of CCE and to provide CCEwith greater substantive content and thus enhance its relevance to practical problems. Theversion of CCE I present, which gives principles of diversity a more central role than theoriginal, will form the basis of the critical arguments in the remainder of the dissertation. Theimpact of my own interpretations of the theory will be particularly significant in chapters six andseven.1. Constitutive and Contextual ValuesIt is generally accepted that scientific inquiry is influenced by certain constitutive or epistemicvalues such as consistency, simplicity and empirical adequacy, which play an important role inguiding scientific inquiry. In addition to these constitutive values, contextual values - individual,social, political and economic values - shape the practices, questions and data, as well as thespecific and general assumptions of scientific inquiry.3 There is extensive empirical evidence ofthe contextually value-laden nature of science from science and technology studies, sociology ofscience, and feminist philosophy of science (all drawing on historical and contemporary casestudies from science).4 Given extensive literature documenting the presence of social values inscience, contemporary philosophers of science acknowledge that scientific inquiry is not freefrom contextual values. The philosophical project is to find ways to limit their influence onknowledge. 3 Ibid., 4-7. For example, a commitment to making a profit from research is a contextual value that influences thepractice of science. Constitutive and contextual values can be positive or negative. So, for instance, if transparencyis a positive value in science, secrecy is the corresponding negative value. I discuss positive and negative valuesfurther in Chapters Five and Seven when I investigate assumptions about bias and objectivity in medicine.4 Perhaps the most famous of these are Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer's Leviathan and the Air Pump on thevalues in experimentation, Karin Knorr-Cetina's analysis of decision-making in the laboratory in The Manufactureof Knowledge, and Donna Haraway's investigation into gender bias in primatology in Primate Visions. For anoverview of many of these arguments, see Brown.41Longino argues that it is not possible to keep contextual values out of science. This is astrong claim to begin with, but she commits herself to something even stronger. She argues, \"notonly that scientific practices and content on the one hand and social needs and values on theother are in dynamic interaction but that the logical and cognitive structures of scientific inquiryrequire such interaction.\"5 In making this argument, Longino goes beyond the more common(and weaker) position that we must tolerate the values that remain in science. Longino makes thestronger claim that values are integral to good science; a science that did manage to succeed ateliminating values would be a greatly impoverished one.2. Background AssumptionsThe mechanisms Longino provides for managing values stem from a claim about theunderdetermination of theories by data and the mediating role of background assumptions ininquiry. In what follows I will explain these core elements of CCE. Underdetermination is \"thein-principle possibility of constructing multiple empirically equivalent, mutually inconsistenttheories for any given body of evidence.\"6 Now an entrenched problem in philosophy of science,underdetermination is primarily an epistemological problem concerning our ability to produceand justify knowledge using only hypotheses and evidence. For any piece of evidence there aremultiple competing hypotheses and the choice of hypothesis cannot be fully determined on thebasis of the evidence alone. This is because the evidence is consistent with more than onehypothesis, creating a logical gap in scientific reasoning. This gap, argues Longino, is filled bybackground assumptions.7Longino explains the role of background assumptions in scientific reasoning using ananalogy to background conditions for causal interactions. When someone creates enough frictionbetween two dry sticks to produce a spark, we are quick to label the action of rubbing the stickstogether the cause of the spark.8 However, if it were the case that this scenario occurred in an 5 Longino, Science as Social Knowledge, 5.6 Longino, The Fate of Knowledge, 127.7 Other philosophers might call background assumptions 'principles of inference', but, according to Longino, thisdoes not capture the contextual (and non-principled) nature of most background assumptions. I will stick with herterminology. Longino, \"Essential Tensions - Phase Two,\" 260.8 Philosophers with Humean sympathies may be less inclined to assign causal relationships so quickly. This justbrings them to the conclusion of the analogy more efficiently. Humeans may also be inclined to point out that'background' assumptions and 'foreground' assumptions are all just part of a complicated set of conditions that42atmosphere radically different from our own - one in which, for instance, there was no oxygen -rubbing the sticks together would not produce a spark. So while we would not normally identifybackground conditions such as the presence of oxygen as a cause of the spark, it is in fact one ofmany factors (causes) that make the spark possible. Longino describes background conditions asthe \"enabling\" conditions of causal interaction. Similarly, background assumptions play anenabling role in the formation of a relationship between evidence and hypotheses or theories,even though such assumptions are often neglected in full descriptions of systems.9Longino argues that background assumptions determine whether a particular state ofaffairs is considered evidence for a hypothesis. Evidence, for our purposes here, is \"anobservation, fact, or organized body of information, offered to support or justify inferences orbeliefs in the demonstration of some proposition or matter at issue.\"10 The same data becomeevidence in support of different hypotheses because of different background assumptions. Inother words, what counts as evidence in a particular domain is, at least in part, determined bycontext. Given the relational nature of evidence, then, it is not possible to distinguish evidencesimpliciter from what is taken to be evidence. The temperature of a patient, for instance, onlybecomes evidence of the flu in light of background assumptions about the nature of the action ofviruses on the human body and physical theories about the action of mercury in glassthermometers. Background assumptions will always play a significant role in the assessment ofevidence. We determine what counts as good evidence by means of the assumptions we make.Once she has established that background assumptions play an ineliminable role ininquiry, concerns about how such background assumptions are justified lead Longino to proposeCCE. If background assumptions are to fill the logical gap between hypotheses and evidence,then what justifies the background assumptions? And how do we prevent idiosyncratic socialvalues (such as gender biases) from becoming background assumptions? Since backgroundassumptions cannot be ultimately justified on the basis of further assumptions or on the basis ofevidence without regress, and since by their nature they are often invisible to those who employthem, Longino argues for the importance of public criticism of background assumptions. It ispeople with perspectives and background assumptions that are different from one's own who are bring about certain effects. The difference in description does not lead to any particular problems for Longino'saccount.9 Longino, Science as Social Knowledge, 41.10 Upshur, VanDenKerkhof, Goel, 93.43in a position to critically evaluate one's assumptions. Traditional accounts of justification, whichemphasize particular principles of inference, are still necessary, though insufficient for a fullaccount of knowledge-production. Longino offers a reconceptualization of justification thatpreserves many of the traditional elements but adds a social dimension. It is no longer possiblefor a person to produce knowledge in isolation; only when her background assumptions havebeen subjected to the scrutiny of others can she be said to have knowledge. Without the additionof this social element, underdetermination remains a serious problem. CCE is, in large part, anattempt to solve this problem of underdetermination. More specifically, CCE is an attempt toimprove standards of justification in a way that, rather than eliminating values in science,acknowledges them and subjects them to critique.Longino claims that philosophers have a special role with respect to backgroundassumptions in science. \"Part of the work of a critical philosopher of science is to make theseassumptions visible and to understand the systematic role they play in scientific inquiry.\"11According to this argument, philosophers of science should pay greater attention to thebackground assumptions in various scientific contexts. Longino is skeptical of the approach to\"bad science\" in which the critical process begins by identifying suspicious science (researchwhich appears to have been guided by, for instance, racist or sexist values) and ends by showinghow such research failed to follow proper scientific standards and guidelines (because ideologyinterferes with the critical capacity required by scientific research and led the researcher to makeunwarranted conclusions). The argument that value-laden science is merely \"bad science\" runsinto difficulty when considering cases in which \"good science\" - that is, methodologicallyrigorous research - still manifests value-laden assumptions. I would suggest that many of themost insidious cases of bad science - certainly of bad medical research - appear at first glance tobe beyond reproach, as they adhere carefully to currently accepted standards of evidence. Theproblem lies in the values underlying those standards of evidence.12According to Longino, an approach that claims to have managed values by drawing upand enforcing methodological rules will ultimately allow the deepest influences of social valueson science to persist unquestioned. There is significant danger associated with narrow attempts toeradicate the pernicious influences of values in science. This danger arises when the 11 The Dualist Staff, \"An Interview with Helen Longino.\"12 I discuss this problem in great detail in Chapters Four through Seven of this dissertation.44methodology that is used to distinguish between the good and bad science is itself value-laden,that is, in \"those cases where the warrants themselves - that is, the methodological procedures orframing assumptions accepted within a field - are ideologically driven or value laden.\"13 In suchcases, shallow investigation into values will only lend the methodologies and backgroundassumptions greater authority.14 Furthermore, the rules and standards put in place to police valueswill themselves be value-laden, though their value-ladenness will be unquestioned. Thus, whatwe need is \"a way to block the influence of subjective preference at the level of backgroundassumptions involved in observation and inference, as well as the influence of individualvariation in perception at the level of observation.\"15 Longino argues that a social mechanism isneeded to perform this function. I will turn now to her proposed strategy for dealing withbackground assumptions and contextual values in inquiry.3. CCE NormsThe mechanism Longino proposes for ensuring broad critical debate on background assumptionswill be referred to as the CCE norms. According to CCE, scientific communities are objective tothe degree that they meet four criteria:1. Venues: there must be recognized avenues for criticism of evidence, of methods, andof assumptions and reasoning.2. Uptake: the community as a whole must be responsive to such criticism.3. Public Standards: there must be shared standards that critics can invoke.4. Tempered Equality: intellectual authority must be shared equally among qualifiedpractitioners.16Collectively, these criteria ensure that the conditions for effective public debate are in place.The point of the first criterion is to ensure public accessibility to the views of others.Recognized avenues for criticism are necessary to ensure that public debate can occur. Thiscriterion is increasingly challenged in the medical context by requirements that researchers enterinto confidentiality agreements with private funding agencies. Such confidentiality agreements 13 Longino, Science as Social Knowledge, 9.14 Ibid.15 Longino, \"Essential Tensions - Phase Two,\" 265.16 Longino, Science as Social Knowledge, 76 with modifications in Longino, The Fate of Knowledge, 128-135.45may require researchers to refrain from publishing results without approval or refrain fromdiscussing results with other researchers for extended periods of time. The specialization ofmedical journals could also be a problem, if it were to mean that critical perspectives wererelegated to different journals from those which published original research. Longino stresses theimportance of equal space for criticisms in the same journals in which original research ispublished.The second criterion ensures that the community not only tolerates, but actively cultivatescriticism. If criticisms are leveled, and then ignored, the community fails to be responsive andthus fails the second criterion. Quite often critical papers are written without any indication thatthe community as a whole has taken note. In my experience, philosophers are particularly goodat meeting this criterion. Within the philosophical community, criticism and response is verycommon, with journals publishing original research side by side with critical evaluations of thatresearch, and conferences often have \"author meets critics\" panels.17The third criterion ensures that there are shared public standards to which communitymembers and critics can appeal.18 Shared standards are necessary because they provide acommon language or point of agreement from which disagreements and different interpretationscan be measured and assessed. Standards are shaped by the cognitive goals and practical aims ofa community.The fourth - and most controversial - criterion ensures the presence of a diverse range ofperspectives within a given community. It does so by ensuring \"tempered equality\" ofcommunity participants. This accords equal recognition to perspectives regardless of social oreconomic power or authority, but does allow for differential recognition of the perspectives ofindividuals with specialized training and expertise.194. Modifications to CCEWhile I agree that the four CCE norms do a decent job of protecting the social structures thatcontribute to effective critical debate - and certainly a better job than the competing social 17 This is common at the annual meetings of the Canadian Philosophical Association, for instance.18 This criterion was originally referred to as shared standards. In The Fate of Knowledge it was renamed publicstandards. It is my understanding that this is a shift in emphasis rather than in content.19 Longino, The Fate of Knowledge, 131.46epistemological theories, as discussed in the last chapter - I think it is worth being a bit cautiousabout what each criterion accomplishes. If we examine the criteria closely, we realize threethings. First, the requirement that there are recognized avenues for criticism is not specificenough. The criterion should protect the publicity and transparency of ideas presented within acommunity. It cannot do this if it only protects venues for criticism without specifying furthercriteria that those venues must meet. If, for instance, commercial interests were to limit thepresentation of research results to the community by restricting publication of the negativeresults of research, the presence of recognized avenues for criticism will not, alone, bring thesehidden results forward. This criterion should protect communities - particularly scientificcommunities - from secrecy and selective presentation of results. In order to do so it shouldrequire that members of the community submit their ideas for consideration in communityvenues. In addition, it should require that presentation of ideas in these venues occurs underconditions of transparency and full disclosure. I discuss these issues in greater detail in ChapterSeven.Second, the requirement of shared standards is a good one but needs to highlight the factthat outsiders can engage with a community as long as they share at least one standard with thatcommunity. This helps to protect the fourth criterion (cultivation of diverse perspectives, seebelow) while preserving a sense of unity within given communities. I discuss the details of myviews on shared standards later in this chapter.Finally, the requirement of tempered equality should be replaced with a requirement thatcommunities cultivate diversity. Longino suggests that equality of authority is required to ensurethat \"every member of the community be regarded as capable of contributing\" to any debate.20 Italso protects the results of community debate from being secured by \"unforced assent\"; temperedequality of authority shields inquiry from undue influence from the economically or politicallypowerful.21 There are a number of problems with this norm. First, there is reason to think that therequirement of shared community standards accomplishes Longino's goal of ensuring anymember of a community has the authority to engage with a debate. Shared standards are the onlylegitimate basis for inclusion and exclusion of perspectives in a given community, so any furtherrestrictions will be unjustified. Thus the shared standards norm protects the voices of the 20 Ibid., 132.21 Ibid.47oppressed. Second, the requirement of tempered equality isn't strong enough. It fails to protectthe perspectives of those outside a given community. The norm ensures that, within a givenknowledge-productive community, there is tempered equality of authority. But what the normneeds to ensure is that there is sufficient attention to those perspectives outside a givencommunity (provided they meet the shared standards norm already outlined).Third, the other three norms have specific practical implications which the equality ofauthority norm, as stated, does not. For example, the importance of recognized avenues forcriticism immediately provides community members with a practical task: developing anddefending such avenues. While the details of this development are context-specific, they are notdifficult to work out. Requirements for peer-reviewed journals or public debates will fall out ofthis first criterion. The revised first criterion that requires community members to subject theirideas for public discussion, and which requires transparency and disclosure on those ideas, doesmore to combat political and economic interests than any particular criterion stressing equality ofauthority. This is because it offers a practical social mechanism for action. But what is thought tobe the practical implication of the requirement for equality of authority? It amounts to a demandthat community members respect the perspectives offered by others and respond in a collegialmanner provided the criticism is advanced by someone who shares some community standards.This requirement merely sums up the other three norms, rather than adding to them. Protection ofthe community from political and economic interests is not something to be legislated through aspecial CCE norm. Intellectual independence or integrity is best seen as one of the collectiveoutcomes of the four CCE norms when they are enacted together.The one element of the fourth criterion worth retaining is its underlying commitment todiverse perspectives. Despite a great deal of discussion about the importance of diverseperspectives throughout Longino's publications, such perspectives are not adequately protectedby the CCE norms. It is diverse perspectives that lead us to objectivity.22 We would do better todrop the less practical and somewhat redundant elements of the fourth criterion and focus it onthe preservation and cultivation of diverse perspectives. This preserves what matters inLongino's fourth norm while radicalizing it somewhat. The details of my views on diversity willbe discussed in the next section. 22 I discuss the specific mechanisms by which diversity contributes to objectivity later in this chapter.48I believe that the modifications I suggest are entirely in line with the goals of CCE. Myrevised list of CCE norms is thus:1. Avenues for Criticism - there must be recognized avenues for criticism, and theseavenues must be publicly accessible and require transparent disclosure of all relevantinformation (including competing interests) from those who present their ideas. Itmust also be a community requirement that all members present their ideas for criticalscrutiny if they wish them to be recognized as knowledge.2. Responsiveness to Criticism - the community must be responsive to criticism.3. Shared Public Standards - there must be some shared standards that determinecommunity membership. Outsiders to a particular community are welcome to engagein critical debates as long as they share at least one of the community standards withthe target community.4. Cultivation of Diverse Perspectives - communities must cultivate diverseperspectives, that is, the perspectives of those who express strong dissent (explainedin the next section).In what follows I will provide a more detailed account of the third and fourth criteria and thepotential tension between the two. Mention of the CCE norms will refer to my modified accountfrom this point forward.5. Cultivating Diverse PerspectivesThe cultivation of diverse perspectives is the last of the four revised CCE norms. Thepreservation of diversity is thought to move communities toward greater objectivity. In whatfollows I will provide support for the central role accorded to diversity within CCE. Much of thesupport I provide is not directly from Longino, since she spends little time addressing thespecifics of requirements for diversity (her attention is focused on the requirements of equality ofauthority). Some parts of the views to follow are therefore my own, but I believe they areconsistent with her position and helpful for extending CCE to practical problems in the medicalcontext. A clear sense of what diverse perspectives are meant to achieve, and how they do so, isimportant for the arguments of the sixth chapter.5.1. Preliminaries49Two distinctions will be helpful. First, a demand for greater diversity might refer to the culturalbackgrounds of trial participants, the gender or socio-economic backgrounds of researchers, thetopics of investigation, the sources of funding, the methodologies, or the theoretical frameworksused in a particular field, to name just a few possibilities. Social epistemologist Miriam Solomonhas recently suggested that \"diversity is a blunt epistemic instrument,\" and that while diversity isgood for knowledge, the specific type of diversity does not really matter that much.23 It isunimportant whether researchers are culturally diverse or a variety of topics are investigated aslong as diversity of some sort is playing an epistemological role. I do not want to go as far asthis, since I believe this position is indefensible, so let me be a bit clearer on the type of diversityI will defend.Diverse perspectives increase the likelihood of full critical debate when they highlightdissent. It is this dissent from mainstream or accepted theories that provides the impetus fordebate and discussion, which in turn contributes to epistemic strength of theories. I am notinterested in weak dissent, which involves mere disagreement with the status quo.24 Rather, I aminterested in those perspectives that give rise to strong dissent; holders of such perspectivespursue, develop, and implement alternative research programs based on alternativemethodologies and/or theoretical frameworks. It is strong dissent that I argue is required by CCE.Second, there are (at least) two different senses of objectivity in common use. On the onehand, objectivity of method has to do with the non-subjective or non-idiosyncratic nature of thecriteria used to develop, test, and accept evidence, hypotheses and theories. This sense ofobjectivity is tied up with concerns about values and bias. On the other hand, scientific data issaid to be objective when it is believed to accurately fit with reality. This is referred to asobjectivity of data, and is related to issues of scientific realism.25 In what follows, I show how 23 Solomon, \"Epistemic Diversity or Epistemic Randomness? (Or, More on the Invisible of Reason).\" See alsoSolomon, \"Norms of Epistemic Diversity,\" 24.24 A version of this distinction was proposed by Deborah Tollefsen at the 3rd Annual Episteme Conference(University of Toronto), May 2-3, 2006 in a talk entitled, \"Scientific Teamwork: Is there room for dissent?\" I havemodified it to better fit with the issues raised by this chapter. It is a rough distinction, useful only for highlighting thedeep character of dissent discussed in this chapter.25 Longino, Science as Social Knowledge, 62. Scientific inquiry is often said to be objective in the second sensewhen it is objective in the first. The relationship between objectivity of method and objectivity of data is morecomplicated than this, but this general idea is correct. Objectivity of method certainly contributes to objectivity ofdata, though there may be other requirements unique to establishing objectivity of data depending on one'sontology.50diverse perspectives contribute to the management of values, or objectivity of method, inscience.5.2. Standard Epistemological Argument for DiversityIt is useful to recall the brief but powerful arguments for diversity offered by John Stuart Mill,which form the core of both Longino's position and my own. I quote him at length:First, if any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for aught we can certainlyknow, be true. To deny this is to assume our own infallibility.Secondly, though the silenced opinion be an error, it may, and very commonly does,contain a portion of truth; and since the general or prevailing opinion on any subject israrely or never the whole truth, it is only by the collision of adverse opinions that theremainder of the truth has any chance of being supplied.Thirdly, even if the received opinion be not only true, but the whole truth; unless it issuffered to be, and actually is, vigorously and earnestly contested, it will, by most ofthose who receive it, be held in the manner of a prejudice, with little comprehension orfeeling of its rational grounds. And not only this, but, fourthly, the meaning of thedoctrine itself will be in danger of being lost, or enfeebled, and deprived of its vital effecton the character and conduct: the dogma becoming a mere formal profession,inefficacious for good, but cumbering the ground, and preventing the growth of any realand heartfelt conviction, from reason or personal experience. 26There are three logical possibilities with respect to the unorthodox or alternative perspectivesoutlined in any domain of inquiry: such views may be entirely true, they may be partially true, orthey may be entirely false. As Mill argued in On Liberty, we cannot deny the first of thesepossibilities (that unorthodox views may be true) without assuming our infallibility. Since thisassumption is not warranted, we must allow that we may be entirely wrong and others may beentirely correct at any given moment. Acknowledgement of our fallibility compels us to cultivateand critically examine all alternative viewpoints on a subject. If, as suggested by the secondoption, the unorthodox views are partially true - and this seems very likely to be the case muchof the time given the history of reform and revolution in science - it is advantageous for us toencourage open discussion of alternative views so that whatever portion of truth they hold may 26 Mill, 64.51be recovered. Finally, it may be the case that unorthodox views are entirely false. It will no doubtbe tempting to suppress unorthodox views so as to minimize confusion and to avoid wasting ourtime and resources. Mill suggests, however, that it is still best to allow such perspectives to beaired and subjected to open debate, since it forces the defenders of the received view to providecareful rational grounds for their position. This increases understanding of the received view andrequires that its proponents revisit the motivation, inspiration, reasoning, and experiencesunderlying their view. It is this reconnection to the passions and reasons behind acceptedpositions that saves those positions from dogmatism.27There might be some concern that Mill's arguments were only intended to apply tofreedom of expression in the public realm, that is, to the limits of governmental interference.Science, the objection goes, is a specialized realm with unique characteristics, and argumentsabout the value of diversity of opinion may not apply in such a realm. In response to thisconcern, recall that Mill suggests the need for \"freedom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects,practical or speculative, scientific, moral or theological.\"28 In addition, Mill writes,On every subject on which difference of opinion is possible, the truth depends on abalance to be struck between two conflicting sets of reasons. Even in natural philosophy[science], there is always some other explanation possible of some facts; some geocentrictheory instead of heliocentric, some phlogiston instead of oxygen.29Mill's arguments are not limited to the boundaries of governmental interference; they go beyondthe political realm to the epistemological. It is not only morally good or politically advantageousto encourage the development and presentation of diverse perspectives, it also advances ourunderstanding of the world. The central thesis of Mill's argument is that diversity of opinion isvaluable for social, moral and epistemological progress. This position is underwritten byrecognition of the inescapable fallibility of human inquiry in all domains, including both politicsand science.5.3. CCE Argument for Diversity 27 Ibid., 64-5.28 Ibid.29 Mill in Lloyd, S404.52In light of the fact that values are pervasive in science, we can extract from CCE a commitmentto increasing transparency through disclosure of the assumptions, values and goals of researchersand encouraging critical interaction among scientists not only on the results of research, but onall aspects of the scientific process. CCE attempts to manage values through requirements fortransformative critical debate within scientific communities. This focus on the scientific processleads to an account in which objectivity is a characteristic of the practice of a scientificcommunity.For many, this candid acceptance of values in science (albeit coupled with a managementplan) looks like a betrayal of scientific ideals held for hundreds of years. In response, Longinoargues that \"it is the more frightening prospect of a science continually at the mercy of dominantinterests, a science that, under the guise of neutrality, helps create a world to serve thoseinterests,\" which should be of greater concern to us.30 Elizabeth Anderson sums this position upeloquently:Insistence on the value-neutrality of scientists is self-deceptive and unrealistic...Indeed, itis self-defeating: when scientists represent themselves as neutral, this blocks theirrecognition of the ways their values have shaped their inquiry, and thereby prevents theexposure of these values to critical scrutiny.31In addition to the standard suggestions for weeding out inappropriate values in research,Longino's approach highlights the need for attention to diverse perspectives in science. This isthe only way we can get at the deepest source of values in science: background assumptions.Background assumptions shared by all members of a particular community are ofteninvisible to its members. This invisibility can render such assumptions immune from criticismeven when criticism is generally encouraged. The presence of diverse perspectives (of the typeproducing strong dissent) is vital for bringing these assumptions to the attention of members ofthe community and thus advances the community toward objectivity.[Background assumptions] do not become visible until individuals who do not share thecommunity's assumptions can provide alternate explanations of the phenomena without 30 Longino, Science as Social Knowledge, 15.31 Anderson, \"Feminist Epistemology and Philosophy of Science.\"53those assumptions...[u]ntil such alternatives are available, community assumptions aretransparent to their adherents.32Thus, diverse perspectives, which draw the attention of the community to its own assumptions,contribute to the critical evaluation of the assumptions. The views advanced by diversecommunities of researchers are an \"epistemological resource,\" and this resource should not gountapped.33 The presence of diverse perspectives allows researchers to \"compare standards and toassess (purported) knowledge produced and accepted in one community in reference to standardsproper to another.\" 34 The only way to achieve this sort of cross-community debate and criticalevaluation is through the cultivation of, and open engagement with, communities in which strongdissent is present. This engagement makes possible a thorough critical interrogation ofbackground assumptions and advances inquiry toward greater objectivity. It also encouragescritical debate on more superficial assumptions and values such as those present in the results ofpublished research. Longino sums up these arguments on diversity stating:[T]he greater the number of different points of view included in a given community, themore likely it is that its scientific practice will be objective, that is, that it will result indescriptions and explanations of natural processes that are ... less characterized byidiosyncratic subjective preferences of community members than would otherwise be thecase.35Diverse perspectives contribute to the methodological objectivity of scientific inquiry andtherefore to knowledge. If we fail to attend to the arguments made by those presentingunorthodox views, \"the assumptions shaping our inferences [will be] hidden, [and] we will notsee the level at which we might entertain and seriously develop new ideas\"36When accepted knowledge in a community is contested by outsiders, and the communitymembers engage in critical discussion with those outsiders, there is an opportunity to revisit andrevise the community's goals and background assumptions. This process will give rise to more 32 Longino, Science as Social Knowledge, 80.33 Longino, The Fate of Knowledge, 155.34 Ibid. \"The ideological dimensions of theories of human evolution or of the role of gonadal hormones in behavior,and in general of any theory accepted, are best revealed through comparison with alternatives. Just so, theideological dimensions of mainstream standards of theory appraisal may be revealed by comparison with analternative set.\" Longino, \"Taking Gender Seriously in Philosophy Science as Social Knowledge, 80.36 Ibid., 225.54objective outcomes, which contributes to the accuracy of scientific research over the long run.\"The point in exposing the... biases lying behind certain research theories is not to show thatthey are false (they might in the end be empirically vindicated), but to make salient the room foralternative programs not based on such biases.\"37 The process is characterized as one in whichknowledge is, \"produced collectively through the clashing and meshing of a variety of points ofview.\"38 When more time is spent testing, analyzing, and critiquing new hypotheses (rather thanextensively developing accepted hypotheses), there is a greater likelihood of accuracy in the endresults.39 Diversity thus increases the objectivity of the methods of scientific research.6. Shared Public StandardsAccording to my modified version of CCE, scientific communities produce contextuallyobjective knowledge to the extent that four norms are present: recognized avenues for criticism;responsiveness to criticism; shared public standards; and diversity of perspectives.40 In whatfollows, I am particularly interested in the requirement that scientific communities have sharedstandards, as this requirement may be in tension with the commitment to diversity defendedabove. In this section, I consider whether a lenient policy on methodological and theoreticaldiversity leads to a collapse of rigorous standards of evaluation and a disastrous \"open-door\"policy on membership in scientific communities. In other words, I consider whether it is possibleto maintain a commitment to shared scientific standards while upholding a commitment todiversity. One can infer a way of addressing these issues from Longino's position, though shedoes not address the issues in much detail. I suggest that as a result of common cognitive goals,scientific communities necessarily share a commitment to empirical adequacy. This requirementprotects scientific inquiry from becoming overly inclusive and sets the boundaries of thescientific community as a whole. I then consider whether, once this minimal requirement is met,members of particular scientific communities might still have reason to exclude some evidence,hypotheses, or values from consideration. I develop and specify the conditions that must be met 37 Anderson, \"Feminist Epistemology and Philosophy of Science.\"38 Longino, Science as Social Knowledge, 69.39 The trade-off is a decrease in fruitfulness as less attention is paid to the careful development of well-establishedhypotheses and theories. I will discuss this problem further in the final section of the chapter.40 Ibid., 76-80.55in order for particular outsider communities to be denied a voice in scientific debates, and thushow diversity and rigorous standards in science can be jointly upheld.6.1. The TensionThe demarcation problem in philosophy of science is concerned with how and where we drawthe boundaries of the scientific community and how we determine the principles and standardsthat will be used to distinguish members from non-members. Various solutions to this problemhave been advanced, though demarcation is still a contested topic in the philosophical literature.Demarcating the scientific community from other types of communities is arguably made moredifficult when we have an explicit commitment to cultivating and embracing diversity. Whendiversity - especially that which gives rise to strong dissent - is encouraged and cultivated in thescientific community, it may be more challenging to find common ground upon which to buildjointly acceptable community standards. Groups that share few metaphysical or epistemologicalcommitments may be hard-pressed to identify overlap with others, yet we know that commonstandards are necessary.Limited resources plague every human endeavor, and the production of knowledge is noexception. Given that time will always be a limited resource, and that material resources(particularly money) are usually in short supply, a lack of standards in science can lead to harmboth directly and indirectly. Direct harm comes about when evidence is produced without criteriafor judging the value of such evidence, allowing, for example, for the production of fraudulentmedical treatments and potentially dangerous 'cures'. Given the tremendous quantity of pseudo-science produced and the harms that result when the public mistakenly places trust in the resultsof such pseudo-science, opening community membership to any and all interested parties isdeeply problematic. In addition, the epistemic price of doing so is high, as it becomes difficult toarbitrate claims to knowledge. A lack of standards in science also indirectly leads to harm whengood scientific research receives fewer of the available resources (as a result of sharing resourceswith everyone), thus making scientific innovations less likely.Thus, as Heather Douglas has recently noted, there exists a tension between \"sharedstandards that provide a basis for discussion/agreement and the diversity of participants\" in any56given community.41 Community standards must be loose enough to allow a diversity ofperspectives to be openly discussed and debated, and unified (or narrow) enough to permitshared goals and common methods of critique and evaluation. If standards for communitymembership are set too narrowly this may result in exclusionary practices and a correspondingdecrease in the presence of diverse perspectives. As we have just seen, diversity is crucial to theobjectivity of scientific inquiry. On the other hand, allowing anyone to be a part of a particularscientific community will mean greater difficulty in finding and agreeing on shared goals andthus greater difficulty in setting and upholding standards - and community standards arenecessary. Longino's contextual empiricism contains one way of settling this tension. In whatfollows, I outline what I take to be the important features of this solution.6.2. CCE and Community StandardsThree key elements make up critical contextual empiricism. The first (the critical part) stressesthe importance of intersubjective debate within and among knowledge-producing communities.This was discussed in the diversity section above. The second (the contextual part) involvesrecognition of the important role played by background assumptions in knowledge-productiveinquiry and the importance of context (particular cognitive goals and practical ends) in shapinghow those background assumptions are determined. This was discussed in the backgroundassumptions section above. The third (the empiricist part) involves commitment to a sufficientlymodest form of empiricism. While Longino does not make the positivistic claim that allmeaningful claims must be empirical, or even the strong empiricist claim that empiricalknowledge should be the only basis of knowledge claims, she does commit to a modest positionthat is at what she calls the \"commonsense core\" of empiricism, in which \"experiential orobservational data are the only legitimate bases of theory and hypothesis validation in theempirical sciences.\"42 The one condition placed on all communities purporting to be scientific isthat they adopt empirical adequacy as a community standard. That is, scientific communitiesmust be responsive to the \"truth of the observationally determinable portion of theories or \"The Irreducible Objectivity,\" 464.42 Longino, \"Essential Tensions - Phase Two,\" 261.57models.\"43 Empirical adequacy requires that there be at least one theory, hypothesis or modelunder which all the observations can be captured. This is referred to as \"saving the phenomena.\"There may be several competing theories or models capable of saving the phenomena inparticular cases - this is the problem of underdetermination. Nonetheless, the commitment toempirical adequacy is an important common element in any proposed theory or model. Onecould not, for instance, just selectively throw out data in order to make a certain theory appearbetter supported. Empirical data, while not the only factor in hypothesis or theory choice, are the\"least defeasible bases of hypothesis and theory validation.\"44 Scientists are required to save thephenomena if they are to retain their ability to interact successfully with the empirical world.This does not in itself explain how scientists should evaluate theories or determine communitymembership, but it does offer a starting point from which to evaluate scientific communities.Thus, though scientific communities are diverse they are united in their commitment toone shared standard: empirical adequacy. References to \"the\" scientific community indicate theoverlap of all particular scientific communities that have declared allegiance to this standard: \"aglobal scientific community whose members answer to some shared and some not sharedstandards.\"45 A standard of empirical adequacy follows directly from a cognitive goal ofunderstanding the natural world and a practical end of interacting successfully with that world.The commitment requires that scientists take seriously the empirical results of their interactionswith nature. Instances of data-fixing and selective reporting of results run counter to thisrequirement. Empirical adequacy will be one standard among many accepted within particularscientific communities. But - critically - within any community purporting to be scientific,empirical adequacy must not be overturned or disregarded in favour of other community values.Empirical adequacy must take priority among community values in order for the community tocount as scientific. Community members must, at the very least, refrain from fraudulent use ofempirical data and have a sincere commitment to discovering new information about theempirical world.Longino offers some general guidance on dealing with the longstanding problem ofdemarcation in the sciences. In her evaluation of New Age crystalology and creationism, forinstance, she argues that they can be legitimately excluded from mainstream scientific inquiry 43 Longino, The Fate of Knowledge, 185.44 Longino, \"Essential Tensions - Phase Two,\" 261.45 The Dualist Staff, \"An Interview with Helen Longino.\"58because they fail to meet any of the accepted community standards of scientific communities.Longino declares, \"to the extent that [crystalology and creationism] satisfy none of the centralstandards operative in the scientific communities of their cultures, they indeed qualify ascrackpot.\"46 She is referring here to the conspicuous absence of any respect for empiricaladequacy within the creationist or crystalologist communities. These pursuits do not count asscientific, in even the broadest sense, because they fail to take seriously the basic scientificcommitment to empirical adequacy.6.3. Local Community Standards and Regulatory StandardsBeyond this shared commitment to empirical adequacy, which results from the cognitive goals ofall scientists, there is no static set of community standards common to all communities within thedomain of science. Though scientific communities often share some community standards,particular communities are likely to choose a range of different regulatory standards in responseto a variety of local factors. Longino writes,In claiming that public standards are required for a knowledge productive community, Iam not claiming that there is a single set of standards that characterize all scientificcommunities. I'm claiming instead that there is a pool of standards - cognitive,substantive, and practical - that communities draw on in regulating themselves...Different, but overlapping, sets from this pool characterize different communities.47Thus, medical research communities are likely to have community standards that incorporatecommitments shared by others within the scientific domain, such as empirical adequacy, as wellas standards specific to the cognitive goals and practical ends of medical research, such asmechanism, reductionism, relevance to pressing medical problems, cost-effectiveness andpractical value of the treatment for patients.48 A cognitive community is defined as \"any groupbound by some set of common goals and shared public standards,\" where the standards serve to 46 Longino, \"Subjects, Power and Knowledge,\" 118. Emphasis added.47 Seriously in Philosophy of Science,\" 335.48 \"The general family of standards from which those locally adopted might be drawn would include such cognitivevirtues as accuracy, coherence and breadth of scope, and such social virtues as fulfilling technical or material needsor facilitating certain kinds of interactions between a society and its material environment or among the society'smembers.\" Longino, \"Subjects, Power and Knowledge,\" 112.59regulate the production and evaluation of knowledge.49 Adherence to community standards is arequirement for community membership and such standards are inferred from the cognitive goalsand practical ends of the community. Scientific communities are particularly successful cases ofcognitive communities because of their well-defined goals (including a focus on knowledge-production as a primary goal) and rigorous methodologies.50 Community standards are bestunderstood as principles or values that guide discussion and interaction, rather than as strict orabsolute rules. Metaphysical and epistemological commitments form much of the content ofcommunity standards.In addition to community standards, there are also lower-level rules and guidelinesgoverning inquiry that are adopted within particular scientific communities. These tend to havewell-defined restrictions and prohibitions and are often created in response to practical concernssuch as determining the most appropriate method for answering a certain type of question withina particular domain. The EBM hierarchy of evidence is an example of this type of standard. Sucha standard outlines rules and restrictions on methods to be used by the mainstream medicalcommunity.51 A distinction will be useful here: I will refer to the more general, principledstandards as community standards, and the more restrictive rule-based standards as regulatorystandards.52 If community standards address the issue of what questions need answering,regulatory standards address how to best answer those questions. This is an important distinction,as those who defend the need for \"rigorous standards\" in science have a tendency to conflate thetwo types of standards and thus impose unnecessarily restrictive demands on communities (or onthose on the fringes of those communities). Standards of both types are designed, adopted, andrevised in response to community goals and in light of challenges encountered whenimplementing the standards in practice.53 In this dissertation, I will be interested primarily inthose assumptions that shape the content of regulatory standards. 49 Longino, The Fate of Knowledge, 145.50 Most human communities qualify as cognitive communities insofar as they are interested in representing theworld accurately in order to achieve their ends.51 I will describe the hierarchy in Chapter Three and critique it in Chapter Five.52 This distinction will be helpful in the latter chapters of the dissertation.53 In the case of both community and regulatory standards, the community dictates what the content should be. Thedifference is in the content of the standards, not in who proposes the standards, as noted in the definition above.When Longino writes of the need for diverse, open discussion on background assumptions, she is referring to boththe global assumptions that shape research within an entire domain and which are the content of communitystandards and the more specific assumptions that make up regulatory standards.606.4. Requirements for Inter-community DebateIn order for one community to be considered among those to which another community must payattention and engage in critical debate, one criterion must be met: the requirement of overlappingstandards. Longino argues that some, but not all, standards have to be shared in order for theresearch produced by one community to claim some right to consideration by those in another.She is speaking here of what I call community standards (since that is her focus throughout herwork): \"Criticisms and endorsement, as well as the proffering of alternative explanatory models,are made germane to a given community by appeal to some one or more of the standards itrecognizes.\"54 Longino suggests that commitment to at least some shared standards is necessaryto provide common ground for effective critical debate.It may be that particular communities are homogenous and have well-defined standardsand boundaries, but as long as there are many of these communities, each with its own well-defined standards and boundaries, diversity will still be served. As long as scientificcommunities are open (and responsive) to critiques from outside their communities (from thosewho adhere to largely - though not entirely - different standards), they are meeting thisrequirement.The goal of critical debate among a variety of communities is not to come to universalconsensus, but \"to make possible the refinement, correction, rejection, and sharing of models.\" 55To the extent that two communities share some community standards and a common domain,they will be compatible enough to engage in productive dialogue and debate. Longino arguesthat a community must at least share the same domain as another community, and therefore havesome relevance to that community's concerns, in order to receive attention from that othercommunity. In other words, \"alternative theories must be perceived to have some bearing on theconcerns of a scientific community in order to have a hearing.\"56 For example, medicalresearchers would not normally be required to pay attention to research in geology sincegeologists work in another domain and tend not to share concerns with human health.Unorthodox views should be attended to when they are critical of the consistency of amainstream research program, or of the background assumptions that were used to pursue such a 54 Longino, \"Taking Gender Seriously in Philosophy of Science,\" 335.55 Longino, Power and Knowledge,\"117.56 Longino, The Fate of Knowledge, 148.61program. Because various non-mainstream communities share cognitive goals and practical ends,as well as some community standards, with the mainstream, they are in a position to be critical ofthe assumptions that underlie the regulatory standards of the mainstream. Somewhat ironically,when the members of the mainstream community demand that alternative communities adhere toall mainstream community standards, they are doing damage to their own goals and ends. It isthrough attentiveness to those who are anomalous by mainstream standards that significantcritical discussion about community background assumptions occurs. In these cases, thecommunity can progress toward greater objectivity. I discuss these issues further in Chapter Six.7. Clarification: Three Senses of Knowledge\"'Knowledge' and its cognates are honorific terms, designating success.\"57 The epistemologicalliterature is replete with variations (and equivocations) on the terms 'knows', 'known', and'knower'. Careful attention to the different ways we understand these terms is vital to a fullappreciation of CCE, and will help to avoid common misunderstandings. Longino identifiesthree independent aspects of knowledge: agency, content and warrant.58 I outline each of theseaspects in what follows.7.1. Agency: Who Knows?Let us begin by considering what it means to say that a particular person knows something.When we are concerned with knowing, we are concerned about the subjects of knowledge andtheir relationship to some object, or the knower to what is known.59 We want to know what it isthat makes this person (or these people) know something. We are motivated to ask questionsabout the relationship between subjects of knowledge and the objects they purport to knowbecause we want to be able to distinguish opinion from knowledge. Most traditionalphilosophical accounts have been designed to explain this relationship. If you run across an \"Sknows that P\" statement in the epistemological literature (followed by a list of conditions), youare probably looking at a theory that aims to explain who knows in this sense. Traditional 57 Ibid., 97.58 I am drawing upon distinctions made in Longino's 2002 book The Fate of Knowledge.59 Ibid., 80.62accounts assume that we are concerned about how individuals know. Non-individualists aboutknowing include holists (who suggest that only groups know), eliminativists (who argue thatnobody knows) and socialists (who suggest that interdependent subjects know).60 As we saw inthe last chapter, the most attractive of these positions, assuming we have established an interestin examining the social conditions of knowledge, is the latter, which preserves some of thecommon intuition that individuals know (which the former two theories cannot) withoutdeferring entirely to individualism. It is thus intuitively appealing as well as likely to beinnovative.7.2. Content: What Do They Know?When we refer to that which is known - the content or object of knowledge - we draw upon thesecond aspect of knowledge. We are not referring to a particular person (as in knowing above) orany particular process (as in warrant below). We are attentive to knowledge as a product.Longino suggests that this is often the starting point for philosophical inquiry.61 Monists believethat there is one correct, consistent and complete account of natural processes.62 In contrast withthis, there are three categories of non-monists: antirealists (or constructivists) who hold thatmultiple accounts of natural processes can be offered, none of which have a necessaryrelationship to the real world, eliminativists, who hold that no correct accounts of naturalprocesses are possible (even if there is an independently existing real world), and realists whohold that multiple satisfactory accounts of natural processes can co-exist.63 The most attractive ofthese positions is a tempered version of the latter, which allows for the possibility of eitherpluralism or monism. We do not need to presuppose either monism or pluralism; rather we canleave the question open and see what sorts of empirical results we end up with. According to 60 Ibid., 91. These are not exhaustive lists of the possible positions. Any number of nuanced positions are possiblethose these are the basic divisions. The same goes for the positions identified in the two categories below.61 That is, philosophers begin by specifying knowledge as a product; driven by a desire to offer a complete accountof truth, philosophers begin from the assumption that inquiry aims at truth. Or, if not truth, then some other (single)goal such as utility or agreement. Longino suggests that the disembodied, detached character of knowledge intraditional epistemology is in part a consequence of this starting point. How philosophers characterize knowledge asa product has implications for the characterization of subjects who know, and of justifications (warrants) ofknowledge.62 Ibid., 90.63 Ibid., 91-2. It is more common for realists to be monists, but a minority of realists are pluralists or, at least, opento the possibility of pluralism.63Longino, we do not need to settle the question of what the content of knowledge will ultimatelybe in order to get on with the project of epistemology. It is worth noting the monist/pluralistdistinction, though, because monism is often assumed and this can lead to restrictions on whoknows and how knowledge is justified.7.3. Warrant: How Do They Prove That They Know?Empirical investigators, in contrast with philosophers, are said to start from an analysis ofknowledge-productive processes. This shapes the way they look at the state of havingknowledge, as well as what is seen as legitimate content of knowledge. How knowledge isproduced matters to whether it is justified or not. \"Divination, tea-leaf reading, [and] the dictateof civil or religious authority\" are thought to be dubious belief-forming processes and should beexcluded from accounts of warrants for knowledge.64 Relativism, whether in epistemology orethics, is generally thought to be a bad outcome since it licenses arbitrary judgements - oftenwith harmful results. In contrast with relativistic views, there are three main types of non-relativism. The most common is absolutism (sometimes referred to as foundationalism), whichupholds context-independent criteria for justification. Eliminativists suggest that justification iseither unnecessary or impossible. Finally, contextualists argue that justification relies on the rulesand principles shaped by the particular context of inquiry. Debates between foundationalists andcontextualists occur over justification, with foundationalists accusing contextualists of collapsinginto relativism and contextualists challenging CCE is a contextualist theory.7.4. The Traditional TriumvirateA comprehensive theory of knowledge must address each of these three senses of knowledge.Traditionally there has been a bundle of these accounts of knowledge, which has included:individualism about agency, monism about content, and non-relativism about warrant.65 Longinosuggests splitting these commitments apart. Her account adopts non-individualism about agency 64 Ibid., 79.65 Ibid., 89.64(this is the social part of her account), non-monism about content (though she leaves finaldetermination of this open), and despite diverging on these first two points, she aims to retain acommitment to non-relativism about warrant. She does this by adopting contextualism ratherthan foundationalism. To sum up, Longino's account of knowledge may be represented asfollows:Some content A is epistemically acceptable [justified] in community C at time t if A is or issupported by data d evidence to C at t in light of reasoning and background assumptionswhich have survived critical scrutiny from as many perspectives as are available to C at t,and C is characterized by venues for criticism [and transparency and disclosure in suchvenues and requirements that community members use such venues], uptake of criticism,[shared] public standards, and [a diversity of perspectives].667.5. Avoiding MisunderstandingsAlvin Goldman has located Longino's critical contextual empiricism in the anti-classicalcategory of social epistemology. This means he does not think Longino's theory of knowledgeengages with traditional concepts of truth or justification. This classification is mistaken.Longino explicitly engages with debates over justification (something anti-classical socialepistemologists avoid), and her account is ultimately compatible with traditional epistemology.Longino describes her work as \"not an abandonment of traditional epistemological questions, buttheir rearticulation for empirical subjects. This rearticulation does not reject traditionalepistemological concepts.\"67 In fact, Longino explicitly rejects a number of competing accountsof social epistemology precisely because they abandon traditional epistemology.68In light of the types of knowledge just outlined, we can see why Goldman might havemade this mistake in classifying CCE. It is clear in Longino's writings that she is not committedto monism about the content of knowledge: she does not hold that there must be one completeaccount of all natural processes. She does not set a unified single goal for inquiry (such as truth).This rejection of a single aim for inquiry can appear to be an acceptance of relativism (though weknow this is not the case), because the traditional bundles of knowledge have associated non-monism with relativism. Similarly, Longino's attention to non-individualism might suggest thatshe accepts relativism. Of course, she is a contextualist justification, and 66 Ibid., 135.67 upholds plausible versions of non-monism, but this point may toooften be missed.Also contributing to this misunderstanding is a distinction Goldman makes in his bookKnowledge in a Social World. He classifies social epistemologists as either consequentialist orproceduralist. Consequentialists set a single aim or goal for inquiry, ranging from truth (veritism)to agreement (consensus consequentialism) to utility (pragmatism or utility consequentialism).Proceduralists, in keeping with their name, are interested in the epistemic value of processes andpractices independent of any particular aim or goal. Goldman claims that while Longino'saccount appears to be proceduralist, when examined more carefully it \"turns out to haveconsequentialist contours.\"69 Moreover, Goldman argues that further analysis would uncover anultimately veritistic rationale for Longino's social epistemology. Goldman is partly correct andpartly mistaken in this characterization. Longino's position is compatible with truth as one of thegoals of inquiry. The mistake here is again in assuming that Longino is tied to a monist positionabout the content of inquiry. In fact, as we've seen, Longino has explicitly built an openness topluralism into her account. She is not interested in settling the debate over the goals of allinquiry, and wants to leave room for pluralism about these goals. So Longino's proceduralism is'infected' by attention to goals only insofar as she leaves open the possibility for a variety ofgoals in the context of inquiry. Her account may appear to be somewhat veritistic in characterbecause truth is at least one of the possible goals of inquiry. But because the goals of inquiry arenot specified by Longino's account, arising instead out of the particular needs of differentknowledge-producing communities, her account takes as its starting point procedures ofjustification (warrant) rather than the (single) aim of inquiry. To be fair to Goldman, insofar asparticular communities adopt goals (such as truth), Longino's account can appear to beconsequentalist in nature. But this is a product of the way people choose to develop knowledge-productive communities in the real world rather than a feature of the account.8. Objections and RepliesLongino's work has been well received by many philosophers of science, social epistemologistsand feminists. It has also been subject to a number of critiques. I will turn now to some of the 69 Goldman, Knowledge in a Social World, 78.66more common concerns with CCE. I supply my own responses to these critiques, and in doing soI draw upon my version of CCE as described above, though I believe my responses to be in linewith arguments that Longino would make.8.1. Failure to Engage with the Messy \"Real\" World of ScienceIn a review of Longino's (2002) book The Fate of Knowledge, Miriam Solomon and AlanRichardson decry Longino's inattention to \"the messy details of the real world in which sciencegets done,\" suggesting that her normative account \"may be neither possible nor necessary forscientific progress.\"70 This overarching criticism has a few distinct elements, some of which gainmore traction than others. I will move from the more straightforward to the more difficultobjections.8.1.1. IntuitionFirst, Solomon and Richardson agree that Longino is correct in recognizing the need for anormative account of scientific inquiry, but are concerned that she seems to be developing heraccount solely on the basis of intuition - which has a \"poor track record in philosophy ofscience\".71 They suggest that Longino's claims to be generally naturalistic are misleading sinceshe has no significant commitment to incorporating insights from scientific practice into hertheory.In reply to this concern, it is first worth noting that Longino clearly states that her accountis only naturalistic insofar as it incorporates a descriptive understanding of human subjects andtheir contexts and goals at the outset. It is not naturalistic in any other, more robust sense. In fact,she states that \"filling in the details between the empirical conditions of knowledge productionand the ideal conditions of success is the job of philosophical theory.\"72 It is true, however, thatLongino relies on intuition, reasoning and explication of concepts in order to develop hernormative account. But it is not clear how this is a robust criticism of Longino. It amounts to a 70 Solomon, Richardson, \"A Critical for Longino's Critical Contextual Empiricism,\" 221.71 Ibid., 213.72 Longino, The Fate of Knowledge, 10. For further discussion on Longino's position on naturalism, see ChapterOne of this dissertation.67claim that Longino's account is not naturalistic and therefore it is bad. But this is just arestatement of the naturalist's position along with a critical evaluation of anyone who is not asubstantive naturalist. Longino is in good company with most other social epistemologists in herphilosophical methods. Her account would seem to stand or fall based on whether there are goodreasons to be concerned about the limitations of a thoroughly naturalistic approach toepistemology. These limitations are highly debated. Moreover, it is not as if philosopherspropose an intuitive idea and then dogmatically stick with it at all costs. The epistemologicaltheories advanced by philosophers like Longino are open to general discussion and critique in theanalytic epistemological community. Traditionally, this sort of epistemological debate has beenboth rigorous and critical: the community is hardly one to adopt a view without question. SoLongino's account of justification - her suggestion that underdetermination in the sciences leadsto pervasive values in inquiry and her proposal of four norms to guide inquiry - is available forgeneral scrutiny. The criticism that philosophers rest on intuitions is misleading in light of theextremely rigorous community evaluation that occurs in epistemology. By Longino's ownstandards, the epistemological community is knowledge-productive. That it is not scientificshould not come as a surprise, since philosophy is not a science.8.1.2. Empirical EvidenceSecond, in a related concern, Solomon and Richardson point out that Longino does not offer anempirical evaluation of her approach. Longino fails to evaluate whether communities that adoptthe CCE norms produce better quality results than other communities. Longino could, forinstance, perform empirical tests comparing communities with the CCE norms to communitieswith different norms in order to see whether there is a difference. Solomon and Richardsonbelieve this sort of evidence is needed. This would require the development of a way to measurethe extent to which the CCE norms are being followed, and then a clear sense of what outcomethe communities are aiming for. Neither of these will be a straightforward task. There is noreason to think that Longino would be opposed to this sort of evaluation, though it may be verydifficult to get around the circularity involved in setting the primary outcome of investigation. AsSolomon and Richardson admit, Longino has indicated a willingness to do this sort of evaluation68(in primatology). The fact that she has not yet done it is not an indication of resistance to theidea.8.1.3. History of ScienceThird, Solomon and Richardson argue that Longino's account fails because it cannot be appliedto cases in the history of science. For instance, in Longino's book she argues that the persecutionof witches in the early modern period, though characterized by certain rules and standards, failedto be subjected to a high level of critical scrutiny. The practices also failed to retain acommitment to accurately describing the empirical world. As a result, the persecutors did nothave knowledge - and certainly did not have scientific knowledge. Drawing on work by LorraineDaston, Solomon and Richardson argue that Longino's account of what was going on in thesecases is too simplistic.73 They claim that historical evidence indicates that witch 'theorists' wereactively involved in critical debates with one another (thus fulfilling the requirement for criticaldebate) and members of the scientific community and were committed to a certain version ofaccuracy (though not quite the one we usually recognize). Thus, they did satisfy the CCE normsand, arguably, even upheld the commitment to empirical adequacy. Accordingly, they should beconsidered knowledge-productive communities, and possibly even scientific communities.Longino is interested in avoiding this outcome. In order to do so she is forced to tighten her fournorms - for instance requiring a more robust social criticism. She must claim that communitiesof witch theorists were insufficiently open to criticism because they ignored concerns raised byinterested parties, including most obviously the women being persecuted. But if she does this itappears as though \"nearly all early modern science\" will fail to meet the new higher standards.74Consequently it appears as though persecutors of witches and early modern scientists will standor fall together as legitimate scientists on her account.Solomon and Richardson also suggest that the difficulties encountered with historicalcases extend to more contemporary cases. They offer an example of one case - rejection ofDarwinism in the early years - where scientists failed to meet the criterion of tempered equality 73 Daston, \"Marvelous facts and miraculous events in early modern Europe.\"74 Solomon, Richardson, \"A Critical Context for Longino's Critical Contextual Empiricism,\" 215.69(or, more precisely, respect for diverse perspectives given shared standards). They did so byfailing to recognizing the work of less-known scientists (such as Darwin at the time).In reply to these concerns, Longino has two options. First, it is worth examining howresponsive communities are required to be in these circumstances. The Darwin example ishelpful here. Longino is not blind to the large body of science studies literature that indicates theimportance of a certain degree of conservatism in scientific practice. There is no reason to thinkthat \"reasonable responsiveness\" to challenges requires that scientists immediately give up theirtheories when confronted with alternatives. What is more often the case is that some elements ofa theory are problematic while others are not and the choice between theories is far fromstraightforward. In these most common situations, responsiveness means being aware ofcriticisms and the weaknesses in one's account and responding to criticisms leveled by others. Itmeans not turning a blind eye. Recall that Longino is open to pluralism and is a firm advocate ofdiversity of theories and methodologies in science and so is not trying to suggest thatresponsiveness be interpreted so radically that a slight breeze knocks over any theory.Second, Longino can bite the bullet and admit that much of early modern science was notas scientific or as productive of knowledge as we would like to think. This reply would besupported by claims she makes about the need for us to \"do better in the twenty-first century thanour forebears did in the eighteenth.\"75 Though she is referring to philosophers (not scientists)when she says this, I think the sentiment suggests a willingness to admit the significant failingsof science - whether today or in the past - and a desire to hold knowledge up as an honorificterm that is not ascribed lightly. In fact, we do think it was problematic that Darwin was ignoredin favour of more socially acceptable scientists in his day in spite of the high quality of his work.The importance of respecting diverse perspectives is demonstrated, not undermined, by thisexample. Longino is offering a normative account of ideal science. Of course it will be possibleto find instances of scientific inquiry that fail her standards. This does not immediately signifythe need to jettison her account. In fact, if all the account did was explain exactly why we areright about everything already it would not be much of a normative account.8.2. Failure to Capture What is Distinctive About Scientific Evidence 75 Longino, \"Reply to Philip Kitcher,\" 577.70Alvin Goldman is concerned about a lack of specificity in Longino's account. He writes,Doesn't more have to be said about the types of evidence distinctive to science (experimentalevidence, presumably) and how, specifically, the evidence is deployed (methods ofinference)? These dimensions are not adequately captured by the abstract and otherwiseunconstrained requirement of interactive criticism.76Longino's account, while more detailed than the general accounts offered by predecessors suchas Pierce, is still quite general. It offers four norms and not too much more. Is this enough?Goldman is correct in pointing out that more needs to be said on this point, thoughperhaps unfair in suggesting that this will be as straightforward as he implies and in chargingLongino, or other advocates of CCE, with the task. Given Longino's commitment to local,contextual knowledge in specific communities, she cannot give much more detail on these pointswithout specifying the context further. But what Goldman seems to want are general scientificmethods and accounts of evidence. If Goldman would accept local, contextual responses to hisquestions, then it is not clear why Longino is the one who should be providing such responses.According to her account it is the members of communities who set the standards and rules anddefend those standards against others. As a result, if you want to say more about methods ofinference and standards of evidence you need to engage in discussions with those communitymembers. This is an interesting project, but one for empirical (not exclusively philosophical)investigation.8.3. Improper Use of Liberal Democratic PrinciplesPhilip Kitcher has argued that Longino's interest in socializing science is laudable but that sheinjects the social element at the wrong point in inquiry.77 Kitcher famously argues for thedemocratization of science policy. He argues that the public should play a role in setting theresearch agenda in science. He also argues for the importance of social discussion and debate onthe results of research. So the social element plays a role before and after research, so to speak.Longino argues that we need to socialize what is in between these two stages of inquiry - themethod itself. This is the key point of contention between their accounts, which otherwise share 76 Goldman, \"Knowledge and Social Norms,\" 2149.77 Kitcher, \"The Third Way.\"71a commitment (or, at least, an openness) to pluralism, an emphasis on the context-dependence ofscience, a recognition that social interests need to be addressed in science, and a sort of liberaldemocratic spirit. Longino playfully refers to Kitcher's position as \"socialism lite\" because, likeGoldman, Kitcher maintains a very weak account of the social and because social interactionsplay only a contingent role in knowledge-production (rather than a necessary role as is the casein Longino's account).Kitcher argues that Longino sees the need for a more robust role for the social becauseshe confuses two problems: the Millian Problem and the Interest Problem. The Millian Problemarises when the exclusion of certain groups of people from scientific discussions leads to adecrease in number of available hypotheses in science. Greater diversity in the scientificcommunity has drawn attention to the Millian Problem and some possible solutions. Forexample, female primatologists revolutionized the field by proposing new hypotheses about theinteractions of primates that relied less on assumptions about the importance of the dominantmale. To use a medical example, the inclusion of alternative medical researchers in discussionswithin the mainstream medical research community may increase innovation and newhypotheses about contested illness such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (about which very little isknown).The Interest Problem arises when the interests of certain subgroups of the humanpopulation are reflected in the type of research that gets done (the questions asked) and the sortsof hypotheses accepted. For example, if the majority of scientists are middle-class Caucasianmen (as was historically the case), medical research is likely to reflect their health concerns andfocus on conditions that differentially affect that demographic, such as heart disease, highcholesterol, and impotence. To use a recent example, the 90/10 problem in medical research(90% of the resources are directed to diseases that affect 10% of the population) is a result ofpolicies that allow researchers to pursue lucrative projects over pressing ones. According toKitcher, democratization can help solve these problems, but in different ways. The solution tothe Millian Problem is to insist on diverse communities as well as responsiveness to criticismfrom those outside one's particular community. The solution to the Interest Problem is ademocratization of the research agenda (of the sort proposed by Kitcher). Longino clearlyidentifies and addresses the Millian problem (in fact, much more thoroughly than Kitcher does).The concern seems to be that in focusing on the Millian problem she fails to address the Interest72Problem. But Longino does address the Interest Problem, if in a slightly different manner thanKitcher. Longino argues that the presence of idiosyncratic interests can only be managed if theassumptions underlying research are subjected to wide critical evaluation by diverse communitymembers and outsiders. Given the overlapping knowledge-productive communities of whichmost people are a part, public criticism of research agendas will be possible (for instance, in theform of critiques of certain assumptions that profit matters more than health). To be fair, Kitchergoes much further in developing the specifics of such a solution, but the general compatibility ofKitcher's and Longino's democratic tendencies would seem to suggest the possibility for areconciliation on the Interest Problem. Longino would not be doing her account any disserviceby agreeing to a role for the public in influencing research programs. The focus of her account iselsewhere - in the careful development of solutions to the Millian Problem. Finally, as she pointsout, even if we are successful at democratizing the research agenda (that is, ensuring that wepursue questions of significance), there will still be a need for democratization of scientificpractice in order to ensure that we most accurately answer those questions. Longino'sepistemological project is distinct from Kitcher's political project.8.4. DogmatismDo communities exhibiting the qualities required by CCE produce knowledge? Goldmanpresents a test case for Longino's account. He describes a religious community in whichmembers form beliefs on the basis of the dictates of a sacred text. Because differentinterpretations of the text are possible, critical discussions and debates over the correctinterpretation of the text are common and even encouraged. Community members adjust theirinterpretations in light of insights by others in accordance with publicly available standards.According to Goldman, this community appears to adhere to the four (original) CCE norms, butwe would not want to classify this community as a knowledge-producing community.Similar cases are outlined in Longino's own work, and she responds to them by pointingout that that communities have to be open not only to the criticisms of community members butto the criticisms of members of other communities who share at least some of the same publicstandards. Insofar as religious communities are closed to the criticisms of other communities -that is, insofar as they are dogmatic in their commitment to certain texts even when confronted73with good evidence in favour of other texts, or against all texts - they fail the requirement ofresponsiveness. Further, on the basis of my discussion on diversity, such communities wouldhave to cultivate strong dissent. But it is unlikely that they do so. This leads to Goldman's coreconcern: the same sort of dogmatism seen in religious communities is present and vital inscience. He characterizes the commitment to scientific methods as dogmatic because\"researchers aren't invited to challenge those [scientific] methods when they submit theirresearch papers.\"78 Further, even if scientific methods are challenged in some venue \"thechallenge is assessed by appeal to logic and mathematics. And aren't those standards dogmatic insome sense?\"79 His point is that Longino's requirement that communities remain open tocriticism of their methods (and, I would add, cultivate diverse perspectives) is too strong and thatno knowledge-producing community will be adequate to the task.In the medical context, physicians do criticize research methods - that is what criticalessays and opinion sections of medical journals are for and why there are usually journal sectionsspecifically designed for these sorts of debates. The commitment that members of particularscientific communities have to methods and methodologies is not dogmatic, and insofar as thereis a tendency toward dogmatism because researchers do not tend to challenge the methods usedin their community, this is a significant and serious failing. Goldman is suggesting that a certainamount of non-vicious dogmatism is necessary to scientific inquiry. But what would scientistshave to fear if they were to be open to debates over the details of their chosen methods?Underlying Goldman's critique is a belief that if you are not dogmatic in defending yourstandards they will collapse. But if you have a good defence of your standards there is no reasonto think they will not hold up to critical scrutiny, and be all the stronger for surviving suchattacks. Standards are dogmatic when people fail to have reasons for them, and fail to givereasons to others who inquire about them. Scientific standards are not, or at least should not be,dogmatic in this sense. A commitment is not dogmatic just because it is not repudiated in favourof another. It is dogmatic when it is upheld even though there are no reasons in its favour, or atleast none significantly better than those offered for alternatives.9. Summary 78 Goldman, \"Knowledge and Social Norms,\" 2148.79 Ibid.74In this chapter, I outlined the key elements of CCE and a novel interpretation of the four CCEnorms. I argued for the importance of diverse perspectives to ensure the ongoing criticalevaluation of background assumptions. I then considered whether there is a tension betweenmethodological and theoretical diversity and rigorous scientific community standards and arguedthat a balance can be struck between these competing values. This balance depends on shared,and indefeasible, commitment to a standard of empirical adequacy within any communitypurporting to be scientific. This one shared criterion provides the basis for collaborative criticalinteractions between communities. Finally, I defended CCE against a variety of criticisms andreiterated the importance of critical evaluation of background assumptions in the pursuit ofknowledge. In the next few chapters I will be drawing on these lessons as I describe andcritically evaluate the standards of evidence proposed by evidence-based medicine.75Chapter ThreeEvidence-based Medicine\"Dad always thought laughter was the best medicine,which I guess is why several of us died of tuberculosis.\"1Surely, if medicine is to be based on something, evidence is a good choice. It is certainly betterthan \"vehemence-based medicine\" or \"eminence-based medicine\", as some of evidence-based medicine (EBM) point out.2 The ubiquitous EBM movement, nowadopted in health care contexts around the world, relies heavily on this initial impression. EBMhas gained at least some of its popularity from the intuitively obvious nature of its name as wellas its apparently innocent and widely accepted goals. It is the motivations and assumptionsbehind the movement that I will be describing in this chapter. There are now many differentinterpretations of EBM available. Of these, I will be focusing on EBM as it has been advancedby the members of the EBM Working Group at McMaster University, since the historical recordindicates that their pronouncements are at the core of the movement. I begin with a briefhistorical overview in order to contextualize the EBM movement. I then describe the uniquefeatures of EBM. Finally I outline the substantive background assumptions underlying EBM.The background assumptions identified in the final section of this chapter will be systematicallycritiqued in chapters four and five.1. History and Development of Evidence-based Medicine1.1. Rationalism and Empiricism3 1 Handy, 21.2 Isaacs and Fitzgerald, 1618.3 Note that these terms are not used in the standard philosophical senses. Rationalists in medicine, for instance, donot only reason from first principles. They are actually quite empirically-oriented as they emphasize the importanceof empirical investigation into basic mechanisms of disease. The designation 'rationalist' was likely picked tohighlight the role of reason in this approach. Empiricists in medicine are thought to be interested in 'whethersomething works' regardless of causes or mechanisms. Again, the use of the terminology does not correspond toclassic philosophical accounts of empiricism. In fact, this whole discussion might be more helpfully cast as a debatebetween empiricist approaches to medicine at different levels. While empiricism (in the philosophical sense)76Modern medicine has inherited two competing approaches to the care of patients. One of these,traced back to Hippocrates in ancient Greece, is loosely referred to as the rationalist approach.Rationalism in ancient Greek medicine emphasized the importance of uncovering themechanisms of disease. Medical doctors could, on the basis of their understanding of physiology,anatomy and other basic sciences, identify problems and reason through to the effects of varioustreatments on patients. This rationalist approach was advanced by the Hippocratic physicians formany centuries and posited single causes as the source of illness and disease. This meant adiagnosis of imbalance in the four humours (blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile) andtreatment designed to restore the body's ideal balance.4 The later empiricists, in contrast,developed an approach to medical practice that eschewed theoretical reasoning in favour ofobservations of patients. They developed their practices through careful observation of cases andcumulative expertise on a number of cases. The primary interest of empiricists was in choosingthe best treatment for a condition, rather than understanding the \"first causes\" of disease.Preferred empiricist methods of treatment were pharmacology and surgery.5For the vast majority of the twentieth century, the ascendancy of modern medicine inNorth America (and concurrent devaluation of otherwise popular systems of alternativemedicine) coincided with the rise of rationalism in medicine. The highly influential FlexnerReport in the United States in 1910 argued for an increased focus on the basic sciences as a vitalpart of medical education. The tremendous influence of the report in the West led to additionalattention to physiology, anatomy, pathology and microbiology in medical schools. In effect, thereport challenged physicians to understand the basic mechanisms of disease. As a result of thechanges in medical schools over the twentieth century, by about 1980 the following descriptionof affairs was offered, \"the orthodoxy of modern medicine is rationalist; a large majority ofphysicians within academic medical centers and in practice are subspecialists who are experts ina particular set of diseases and focus on particular organ systems or diseases.\"6 Speaking of thehistorical dominance of laboratory science in hospitals, Kerr White has described the dominant prevails in medicine, there are vigorous ongoing debates about whether it is more appropriate to ask questions aboutbasic mechanisms of disease at the micro-level (pathophysiology) or whether we are best if we simply investigate'what works' at the level of the average patient (as in RCTs).4 Newton, \"Rationalism and Empiricism in Modern Medicine.\"5 Ibid. This version of historical events is simplified in order to draw out the rationalist/empiricist distinction.6 Ibid., 304.77mentality colourfully as follows, \"[D]iseases have single causes, and they are mostly 'bugs'.What I call the Big Bug Hunt was under way: we have got to look for bugs everywhere.Meanwhile, the hygienists who looked at the environment, including the social scene, poverty,economic conditions, and occupational hazards, were cast aside by the biomedicalestablishment.\"7 Also cast aside were epidemiologists and medical researchers conducting trialson groups of patients. The return to an empiricist approach to medicine, however, came aboutrelatively quickly and with great force. As Warren Newton puts it, \"for all its rhetoric of novelty,Evidence Based Medicine represents a counter-revolution of traditional empiricism, draped inmodern clothes of statistics and multi-variate analysis.\"81.2. Clinical EpidemiologyFrom approximately the late 1960s to the 1990s, (with significant growth in the late 1980s)physicians in Canada, the United States and Europe began to shift their attention to a newapproach to medicine that was based on the increasingly popular methods of clinicalepidemiology.9 The new movement was thought to remedy a perceived over-reliance onlaboratory (basic science) research as a resource for medical decision-making. Epidemiologicalmethods were traditionally within the purview of public health but work by a number of scholars,notably Alvan Feinstein at Yale University, sought to adapt these methods for clinical practice -hence, clinical epidemiology. Feinstein's book Clinical Judgment (1967) provided much of thegroundwork for the movement by outlining the need for greater systematization, classificationand consistency in medical diagnosis and treatment.10 The first comprehensive textbook of thenew field, Clinical Epidemiology: The Essentials, emerged in 1982.11 Finally, Feinstein'sClinical Epidemiology, in 1985, had a significant impact on many practicing physicians whowere attracted by his desire to define, classify and quantify the various elements of clinicalpractice.12 In effect, Feinstein called for a taxonomy of medical practice. Many of Feinstein'soriginal suggestions were ignored, but the commitment to using data obtained from populations 7 White, quoted in Daly, 42.8 Newton, \"Rationalism and Empiricism in Modern Medicine,\" 314.9 Epidemiology.10 Fletcher, Fletcher, and Wagner.12 Feinstein, Clinical Epidemiology: The Architecture of Clinical Research.78of patients to guide decisions at the bedside remains the core of clinical epidemiology today.13Clinical epidemiology was touted as a new \"basic science of clinical medicine,\" designed toreplace the Flexnerian reliance on the laboratory sciences.14Clinical epidemiologists upheld a commitment to studying populations and using theknowledge gained to guide decisions at the level of individual patients. This was driven by afrustration with the uncertainties of clinical decision-making, dissatisfaction with traditionalapproaches to medical care and a desire to separate out good from bad medical practices. Thefirst department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics was established at McMasterUniversity in Canada, under the leadership of David Sackett. It was the members of thisdepartment, including, among others, Brian Haynes and Gordon Guyatt, who formed theEvidence-based Medicine Working Group.1.3. MotivationsThe EBM movement arose for countless reasons, each of which is grounded in the social,historical, economic and political contexts of modern health care. I will mention threecontributing factors here. The first variable was the incredible growth in laboratory research inthe biomedical sciences over the twentieth century. From biochemistry to genetics, laboratoryresearch has expanded significantly and this has spurred research in a variety of health-relatedfields. These advances, when coupled with vigorous efforts on the part of medical professionalsto become more scientific (from the Flexner Report through to pharmacogenetics), led toincreased attention to the biomedical sciences. Second, the growth of clinical research, whichwas aided by developments in statistics in the early part of the century, led to the creation ofthousands of new medical journals. Physicians who were trained in basic sciences appeared ill-equipped and often, as a result, ill-motivated to stay on top of the massive quantity of research 13 Contributions by Danish scholar Henrik Wulff are also worth noting. Wulff's book Rational Diagnosis andTreatment, first published in 1973, echoed many of the sentiments raised by Feinstein, and he later developed aphilosophical analysis of clinical medicine in Philosophy of Medicine: An Introduction. Particularly in the latterbook, Wulff offers some useful insights into the motivations, and also the shortcomings of approaches to clinicaldecision-making (such as clinical epidemiology) that neglect the humanistic elements of health care. Thesesentiments are echoed by Jeanne Daly in her book.14 Sackett et al., Clinical Epidemiology: A Basic Science for Clinical Medicine.79(of highly variant quality) published every day.15 They lacked the statistical knowledge and thecritical attitude necessary to tackle the evaluation of such research. The advent of thetechnological age only exacerbated this problem, as it allowed greater and more efficient accessto these journals, through a variety of databases (MEDLINE, for instance).Third, a number of surveys were produced, indicating that patients with similarsymptoms were receiving different treatments depending on the particular physician theyvisited.16 This was true even in the case of illnesses where fairly conclusive evidence waspresent to indicate a particular treatment choice. This \"troubling\" lack of consistency amongphysicians reflected two important facts. Physicians were continuing to provide treatments (forexample anti-arrhythmic agents such as flecainide and encainide, penicillin for the flu, orshaving and enemas for childbirth) long after they had been proven harmful or unnecessary, andphysicians were failing to prescribe treatments even when such treatments had been subjected toconsiderable testing and were widely regarded as the best available treatment for a particularcondition.17 The potential for significant harm to patients in these circumstances is clear. EBMwas developed as a response to these and other concerns and was a natural outgrowth of thepopular clinical epidemiology movement that had been occurring in the West since the 1960s.182. EBM Version OneEvidence-based medicine is the application of the techniques of clinical epidemiology to theproblems encountered at the bedside. In the early 1990s, The Journal of the American MedicalAssociation (JAMA) published a series of articles in which the members of the Evidence-basedMedicine Working Group introduced and carefully outlined a new approach to medical teachingand practice.19 In characteristically grandiose language, the group pronounced: 15 \"The difficulties that clinicians face in keeping abreast of all the medical advances reported in primary journalsare obvious from a comparison of the time required for reading (for general medicine, enough to examine 19 articlesper day, 365 days per year with the time available (well under an hour a week by British medical consultants, evenon self reports.\" Sackett et al. \"Evidence Based Medicine: What it Isn't,\" 71.16 Tanenbaum, \"'Medical effectiveness' in Canadian and Medicine Working Group, \"Evidence-based Medicine: A new approach to teaching the practiceof medicine\"; see also Guyatt, Sackett, Group] \"Users' guides tomedical literature.\"80A new paradigm for medical practice is emerging. Evidence-based medicine de-emphasizes intuition, unsystematic clinical experience, and pathophysiologic rationale assufficient grounds for clinical decision-making and stresses the examination of evidencefrom clinical research. EBM requires new skills of the physician, including efficientliterature searching and the application of the formal rules of evidence.20The \"former paradigm\" was based on the following assumptions about medical decision-making:1) Unsystematic clinical experience is a good basis for medical decisions, 2) Reasoning frompathophysiologic principles is a good basis for medical decisions, 3) Physicians possess the skillsto evaluate the results of clinical research trials, and 4) Expertise and clinical experience are agood source of knowledge on which to base guidelines for clinical practice.21 Unsurprisingly, the\"new paradigm\" disputes these assumptions, one by one. The stated assumptions of the newparadigm are:1) Experience and intuition are necessary but not sufficient for medical decision-making.2) Reasoning from pathophysiologic principles is necessary but not sufficient for medicaldecision-making.3) Systematic, reproducible and unbiased observations (such as those found in clinicaltrials) are a good 'base' for medical decision-making.4) Rules of evidence are necessary in order to critically assess the results of clinicaltrials.22These assumptions amount to claims that clinical research should be the basis of medicaldecisions and that new rules, principles, and skills are needed to support this approach.Recognizing that evidence in medicine comes in many different forms, EBM proponentsintroduced various hierarchies of evidence (notably those for diagnosis, prognosis, andtreatment) designed to help physicians determine the relative value of evidence produced bydifferent research methods. The hierarchy for medical treatments was the centerpiece of the newmovement. This hierarchy of evidence was designed to aid physicians in their day-to-daymedical decision-making. The primary role of the physician, as proclaimed by initial EBM 20 Ibid., 2420. \"Intuition\" (in this context) refers to a subtle decision-making method that draws upon years ofprofessional experience and is generally inaccessible to new practitioners. It is often context- and even patient-specific.21 Ibid., 2421.22 Ibid.81enthusiasts, was to keep on top of, and critically appraise, current research on a given disease ormedical issue, and then to apply the results of this critical investigation to individual patients.3. The Hierarchy of EvidenceThe difficulty of achieving consensus among medical experts led to the creation of the firsthierarchy of evidence. David Sackett originally proposed the idea of ranking evidence on a scaleas an objective method for resolving disputes among physicians at consensus conferences.Consensus conferences had a tendency to stall once various experts had presented the evidencefor their preferred position. What Sackett did was aid the members in developing a method forcomparatively assessing evidence. Case reports were graded lower on the ranking, whilerandomized controlled trials held the top spot. Later developments added meta-analyses of RCTsabove single RCTs and the details of the middle-levels were worked out in greater detail.The evidence hierarchy was designed to reflect the methodological strength of scientificstudies. It is assumed that better evidence on this scale is less likely to be infected by bias, morelikely to correctly attribute causal powers to a particular treatment and more generalizable.23 TheOxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine offers the most well-established version of thehierarchy.24 Because this version was produced by members of the original EBM Working Groupincluding David Sackett, Sharon Straus and Brian Haynes, I will use it as the focus of myanalysis. The hierarchy for therapy, prevention, aetiology and harm ranks research methods asfollows:Systematic review of RCTsIndividual RCTAll or noneSystematic review of cohort studies 23 The Users' Guide to the Medical Literature (also edited by members of the EBM Working Group) has offered thefollowing version of the hierarchy: observational studies; Single observational study; Physiologicstudies; Unsystematic clinical observations. This hierarchy has the n-of-1 trial at the top, unlike most otherhierarchies in the medical literature. This is because of efforts by editor Gordon Guyatt to draw attention to the n-of-1 design. Guyatt and Rennie, Users' Guide to the Medical Literature, 7. It is otherwise very similar to the Oxfordversion used here.24 There are multiple competing hierarchies on offer these days. Ross Upshur has collected seven versions of thehierarchy for therapy so far. Though there are some differences, and these differences do matter in practice, mosthierarchies share the same general structure and I intend my analysis to apply to any version though I focusspecifically on the most well-known hierarchy.82Individual studyCase-seriesExpert opinion without explicit critical appraisal,or based on physiology, bench research or \"first principles\"25Variations of the hierarchy offered by other agencies tend to follow this same basic pattern. Thatpattern is:Experimental TrialsObservational StudiesAnecdotal Evidence, Bench Research, Physiologic PrinciplesSystematic reviews are preferred over single trials (of whatever design) and experimentalmethods are preferred over observational methods. While the EBM movement is ostensiblycommitted to a broad definition of evidence as \"any empirical observation about the apparentrelation between events,\" the hierarchy implicitly offers a more limited account.26 In spite ofsome gestures indicating the importance of an inclusive account of evidence, EBM proponentsgo on to restrict the scope of good evidence through the hierarchy: \"The hierarchy implies a clearcourse of action for physicians addressing patient problems: they should look for the highestavailable evidence from the hierarchy.\"27According to EBM, a physician searching for a treatment for a particular patient shouldformulate a question, do a literature search for relevant studies, and consult the evidencehierarchy in order to determine the quality and strength of the results obtained. Once a fullcritical appraisal has been performed, he or she can then weigh the particularities of the 25 Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine. I have simplified the descriptions of each of the levels for clarity.The rare \"all or none\" trial occurs when all patients died before the treatment became available but with thetreatment some now survive, or when some patients once died but now none die with the treatment. In terms of otherpopular hierarchies, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force offers this version: \"Level I: Evidence obtained from atleast one properly designed randomized controlled trial; Level II-1: Evidence obtained from well-designedcontrolled trials without randomization; Level II-2: Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-controlanalytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group; Level II-3: Evidence obtained frommultiple time series with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be regardedas this type of evidence; Level III: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptivestudies, or reports of expert committees.\" U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. This hierarchy was adapted from oneproduced by the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination and is frequently used in practice.26 Guyatt and Rennie, Users' Guide to the Medical Literature, 6.27 Ibid., 8.83individual case against the determined objective strength of the evidence. The evidence hierarchywas created in large part to assist physicians in weeding out biased research from high qualityresearch. EBM advocates do not make any claims about the complete or perfect objectivity ofany particular types of studies. They would be the first to say that they have simply evaluatedthe relative rigour of different types of medical evidence, and that some evidence fares better inthis evaluation. The final result of this evaluation is that \"the randomised trial, and especially thesystematic review of several randomised trials, is so much more likely to inform us and so muchless likely to mislead us.\"28 EBM is thought to promise certainty of decisions, transparency ofreasoning and a \"scientific\" approach to medicine.4. Epidemiological TerminologyIt will be helpful to have a basic understanding of the most common research methods beforecontinuing any further. In what follows I briefly outline the most common experimental andobservational designs. I also introduce some of the general epidemiological terminology that willcome up in the next few chapters.4.1. Experimental DesignsSo-called \"experimental\" trials are contrasted with observational studies.29 In experimental trials,investigators actively divide the participants into groups. The action of intervening serves todistinguish experimental trials from observational studies. There are two common types ofexperimental trials: RCTs and n-of-1 trials. The RCT is a trial design whereby subjects, who aresimilar at the outset, are assigned by random allocation to intervention and control groups. It isotherwise identical to prospective cohort studies in its causal inferential structure (cohort studiesare discussed below). The focus in the EBM literature, and in this dissertation, is on phase-threeRCTs, because it is at the phase-three stage that treatments - usually drugs - are assessed at thesuggested dosage in a large number of people suffering from the condition or disease. In other 28 Sackett et al., \"Evidence-based Medicine: What it is and what it isn't,\" 72.29 Though widely used, I do not think this distinction holds up under scrutiny. Why, after all, is random allocation ofparticipants into groups the only type of intervention that counts as a true active intervention? The sorts ofinterventions present in, for instance, case studies do not seem to matter here for some reason.84words, these are the last trials before a drug receives approval for general marketing and use.30The n-of-1 trial was developed by Gordon Guyatt and colleagues in the late 1980s in response toconcerns that the traditional RCT fell short of providing guidance for particular individualpatients.31 It was first used to investigate treatments for a patient suffering from chronic asthma.32The n-of-1 trial is, essentially, a trial of therapy in an individual patient. The n-of-1 uses thestandard RCT method but uses a sample size of one. It is a single-patient trial, in which thepatient begins with one treatment and then switches to a control (treatment or placebo) after apre-determined amount of time.33 This can go on for as long as desired with further treatments, orback and forth between one treatment and control. The idea is that the patient acts as his or herown control. Just as in standard RCTs, subjects and physicians can be blinded to the order of thetreatments (blinding is explained below).4.2. Observational DesignsObservational studies are thought to be less trustworthy than experimental trials. In observationalstudies, participants are either already grouped (as in diseased groups within case-controlstudies) or choose their own grouping. They are not actively divided into groups by investigators(though they may be recruited into the study by investigators, and thus be selected from thegeneral population). It was observational studies that established the efficacy of, for instance,insulin in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis and hip replacement for patients with debilitatinghip osteoarthritis.34 The most common types of observational studies are cohort studies and case-control studies.Cohort studies can be either prospective or retrospective. Prospective cohort studiesfollow exposed and non-exposed groups over time (with respect to some suspected causalfactor), and compare disease rates during the time period. Retrospective cohort studies do the 30 Phase one trials are performed on healthy human subjects and are often used to establish safety and dosage levels;phase two trials are performed on small groups of subjects who suffer from the disease or condition and investigateefficacy, phase three trials are larger versions of the phase two trials, often on thousands and even tens of thousandsof patients. Phase four trials, which are not carried out as often as they should be, track the effects of treatment in thegeneral population once the treatment is widely available. Phase four research is vital to establishing thegeneralizability of trial results and to examining long-term effects since phase-three trials are often of short duration.31 Guyatt et al., Daly, 87.33 \"cross-over\" design may also switch patients between treatments.34 Guyatt and Rennie, Users' Guide to the Medical Literature, 7.85same, but make use of historical records rather than following people forward from the presenttime. Retrospective cohort studies differ from case-control studies in that they begin by groupingthe historical records of subjects according to suspected health factors, rather than beginningwith patient who have particular diseases. A cohort study on smoking would follow smokers andnon-smokers and compare, for instance, rates of lung cancer in the two groups.Case-control studies start with a group of subjects who are suffering from a disease(\"cases\"). The investigators then retrospectively compare the exposure (to some suspected causalfactor) of these diseased subjects with the exposure of people who did not contract the disease(\"controls\"). For instance, a case-control study might investigate whether subjects with lungcancer were exposed to more or less cigarette smoke than subjects in a similar demographic (age,gender, etc.) who did not develop lung cancer. Challenges arise in choosing the appropriatecontrol group, since many different control groups are possible depending on your hypothesis.Finally, case studies are presentations of interesting or unusual individual cases and case seriesare collections of case studies.4.3. General TerminologyEfficacy is a measure of the effect of an intervention under ideal conditions. RCTs are relativelygood at establishing efficacy of certain treatments. Efficacy is also often referred to as theinternal validity, or integrity, of a trial. Effectiveness is a measure of the effect of an interventionunder usual conditions. Intention to treat analysis, where subjects are analyzed according to thegroup they were assigned, regardless of whether they completed the trial, aids in establishingeffectiveness. Pragmatic trials (discussed in Chapter Six) can also improve the ability of an RCTto establish effectiveness. Effectiveness is also often referred to as the external validity, orgeneralizability, of a trial.Another common term encountered in the epidemiological literature is blinding. In asingle-blind trial, the subjects do not know to which group (treatment or control) they belong. Ina double-blind trial both researchers (physicians) and subjects are unaware of which subjects arein each of the groups. In a triple-blind trial, the statistician interpreting the results is also blindedto the groupings. There are interventions to which experimenters cannot be blinded (such as86surgical interventions). There are also interventions to which subjects cannot be effectivelyblinded (such as lifestyle interventions). Effective blinding requires diligence.Meta-analyses combine the results of various single trials that address related hypotheses.They have the advantage of bringing together data from a number of different primary sources.The most common meta-analyses are those of RCTs. The sample size - the number of subjectsstudied in a particular trial - is usually much larger in meta-analyses because the data fromindividual trials under consideration are pooled together.Finally, a note about the distinction between method and methodology as the termsappear in this thesis. The tools of scientific investigation are its methods. These are the means bywhich scientific inquiry is carried out. Broadly speaking, a method is the procedure used to attainan end. More precisely, in science a method is \"a special form of procedure or characteristic setof procedures employed (more or less systematically) in an intellectual discipline or field ofstudy as a mode of investigation and inquiry, or of teaching and exposition.\"35 The metaphysical,epistemological and practical principles and procedures that determine how such tools areapplied are properly referred to as its methodology. Methodology is a branch of epistemologywhich investigates the methods used in a particular field. In contemporary usage, it involves \"thestudy of the direction and implications of empirical research, or of the suitability of thetechniques employed in it; (more generally) a method or body of methods used in a particularfield of study or activity.\" 36 A methodology \"describes and analyzes methods for reaching aspecific goal.\"37 There is a tendency to use methodology to mean method (as in \"themethodology of this study was a RCT\"). This is an improper use of the terminology and itglosses over an important distinction between theory and practice. My concern in this thesis ismethodological. In order to accurately describe the methodology of medical research, it will benecessary to look at the particular methods used by researchers and the ways in which they aredifferentially valued. This allows for the sort of systematic evaluation of medical methods that isnecessary to this investigation.5. Assessment of Evidence in Three Stages 35 Oxford English Dictionary, \"Method.\"36 Oxford English Dictionary, \"Methodology.\"37 Longino, Science as Social Knowledge, 20.87EBM recommends the assessment of clinical research evidence in three stages. I will outlinethese stages in what follows.5.1. ValidityAccording to proponents, the hierarchy of evidence provides a ranking of trial \"validity\".38 How,then, is validity assessed by physicians? The EBM handbook suggests that physicians ask thefollowing sequential questions in order to determine validity:1) Was the assignment of patients to treatment randomized?2) Was the randomization concealed?3) Were the groups similar at the start of the trial?4) Was follow-up of patients sufficiently long and complete?5) Were all patients analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized?Some finer points:6) Were patients, clinicians and study personnel kept blind to the treatment?7) Were groups treated equally, apart from the experimental therapy?39Note that assessment of validity begins with three questions related to randomization and thatquestion five assumes randomization has taken place. Presumably question five is worded theway it is because physicians following the rules have jettisoned all non-randomized trials by thatpoint. This emphasis on randomization will be discussed in Chapter Five.5.2. ImportanceOnce trial validity has been assessed, the \"importance\" of the trial is determined. At this stage,physicians ask two questions:1) What is the magnitude of the treatment effect?2) How precise is the estimate of the treatment effect?40 38 This account of validity bears no relation to standard accounts of deductive validity in logic.39 Straus et al., 117.40 Ibid., 123.88Note the narrow scope of importance here. There are no questions about clinical significance, butrather assumptions about the magnitude and precision - or narrow confidence interval - achievedby a study. I will discuss these sorts of statistical assumptions in Chapter Five.5.3. RelevanceFinally, physicians determine whether the evidence is applicable to their patient. They areadvised to ask:1) Is our patient so different from those in the study that its results cannot apply?2) Is the treatment feasible in our setting?3) What are our patient's potential benefits and harms from the therapy?4) What are our patient's values and expectations for both the outcome we are trying toprevent and the treatment we are offering?41Note the optimism in the first question. Physicians are not asking whether their patients aresimilar to those enrolled in the trial they are reading, but rather whether they are so different thatthe results are inapplicable. The authors go on to stress that significant differences usually willnot be found and that physicians can generalize on the basis of RCTs without too muchdifficulty. I will discuss the generalizability of clinical research in Chapter Four. Physicians whofollow this extended set of questions carefully when assessing medical evidence are supposed tobe able to make an informed recommendation about the appropriate treatment for a particularpatient.6. The ReactionReactions to the introduction of EBM were swift. While some of the initial responses werecautiously optimistic, there was also a strong critical reaction from many physicians. Editorialsand articles began to appear in medical journals voicing concerns that the art of clinicalproficiency and conscientious individual judgement were being lost under the weight of meta- 41 Ibid., 132.89analyses of RCTs.42 Charges of \"cookbook medicine\" and concern about the diminished focus onexpertise, clinical experience and judgement provoked a response from the members of the EBMWorking Group.7. EBM Version TwoIn 1996, several of the authors of the original declaration of EBM published an article entitled,\"Evidence-based Medicine: what it is and what it isn't,\" designed to clarify (and tone-down)some of the more contentious claims from the initial formulation. In this oft-quoted article,Sackett and colleagues offer a more thoughtful and carefully worded description of theirapproach to medicine:Evidence-based Medicine is the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current bestevidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. The practice ofevidence based medicine means integrating individual clinical expertise with the bestavailable external clinical evidence from systematic research.43This latest definition reflects an attempt on the part of EBM advocates to honour the art as wellas the science of good medical practice. The new, more integrative EBM explicitly recognizesthe importance of clinical expertise, judgement, intuition and patient values:External clinical evidence can inform, but can never replace, individual clinical expertise,and it is this expertise that decides whether the external evidence applies to the individualpatient at all and, if so, how it should be integrated into a clinical decision.44The change in tone here is palpable. Instead of calling for a revolution, EBM proponents arelooking to reconcile the \"former\" and \"new\" paradigms of medicine. Or, at least, that is how thisappears on the surface.Response to the latest version of EBM has, once again, been mixed. Some physiciansfind the idea of basing medical practice on the best available evidence to be beyond reproach - 42 Naylor, \"Examining of Clinical Toward a medicalepistemology the art of medicine.\"43 Sackett, et al., \"Evidence-based Medicine: What it isn't,\" 71.44 Ibid., \"Evidence-based Medicine: What it is and what it isn't,\" 72.90even \"obvious\".45 Others direct their attention to the precise meaning and interpretation of theterms conscientious and judicious in the EBM definition.46 Still others continue to write in tomedical journals with concerns about the shortcomings of the new approach, including: thepersistent \"grey zones\" of clinical practice47, the primacy accorded to RCTs in the evidencehierarchy48, the absence of discussion on the role of values in medical decision-making, and thetendency to downplay the individual and complex nature of the patient-physician interaction.49Defenders of EBM maintain that these criticisms are \"misguided\", \"misunderstandings\", or even\"clearly invalid\".50 They maintain that there is no reason for physicians to fear the newer, moreinclusive version of EBM. Uptake of EBM by physicians has been slow, despite widespreadattempts to encourage the use of EBM guidelines.8. The Background Assumptions of EBMEBM is a movement premised on a particular account of good evidence. As was discussed in thelast chapter, data becomes evidence only in light of background assumptions.51 When we speakof evidence, we have either some explicit or implicit idea of the framework within which someparticular data becomes evidence: \"Evidence itself does not recommend its own interpretation.\"52All evidence is really evidence that meets context-specific requirements: \"Nothing can count asevidence for anything except relative to a host of auxiliary assumptions; and the strength withwhich a body of evidence supports a hypothesis can never be higher than the credibility of theseauxiliaries.\"53 How is it, then, that EBM is able to specify simply \"good evidence\" through theevidence hierarchy? This is because the background assumptions have been filled in. Goodevidence in the hierarchy is evidence that meets assumptions outlined by early EBM advocates.Standards of evidence are not self-evident. Evidential standards are created by identifyingcommon characteristics of good evidence identified across disciplines (it often, for instance, 45 Laupacis, \"The Future of the \"Evidence-based Policy,\" 14.91increases the likelihood that a given hypothesis is true), but such standards are also designed withspecific attention to the contextual features in which the evidence is produced and utilized.54 Inmedicine, the EBM standards of evidence are an attempt to impose a particular view of goodevidence, and therefore of appropriate treatment, on the practice of medicine. The designers ofEBM made a number of assumptions. First, they made assumptions about the nature and goal ofmedicine as a science. Second, they made assumptions about clinical decision-making. Third,they made assumptions about the need for a hierarchy of evidence. I will identify and describethese assumptions below. Critical discussion of each of these assumptions will follow in the nexttwo chapters.8.1. Medicine Should Be More ScientificOne of the members of the EBM working group, Gordon Guyatt, originally proposed the name\"scientific medicine\" to describe the new movement. Because it seemed to imply that physicianswere otherwise unscientific it was heavily critiqued by his colleagues and was later jettisoned infavour of evidence-based medicine.55 The desire of early EBM enthusiasts was to create a morescientific approach to medicine. The EBM Working Group writes, \"systematic attempts to recordobservations in a reproducible and unbiased fashion markedly increase the confidence one canhave...in the efficacy of treatment\".56 While clinical experience and instinct are still valuable,\"one must be cautious\" with them because they can be \"misleading.\"57 The assumption is thatphysicians should be more confident in their clinical decisions if they stem from systematicscientific evidence rather than from unsystematic clinical experience. This first assumption tiesmedicine closely to science. Good evidence is characterized as unbiased, systematic andquantitative. It isolates clear causal relationships and is generalizable across populations in alaw-like manner. Personal experience and intuitions fail to meet these standards. The valueplaced on these qualities reflects the authors' belief that medicine would be improved bybecoming more scientific. This is supplemented later in the paper with the final assumption that 54 There is extensive debate within epistemology and philosophy of science on the necessary and sufficientconditions - if in fact there are any - for evidence generally. Even the claim that evidence increases the probabilitythat a particular hypothesis is true has been contested. See Achinstein for a full elaboration of this debate.55 Presumably similar concerns have arisen with the new name!56 Evidence-based Medicine Working Group, 2421. Emphasis added.57 Ibid.92\"physicians whose practice is based on an understanding of the underlying evidence will providesuperior patient care.\"58 EBM advocates also assume that physicians' confidence levels (whichare meant to be a reflection of better patient care) should be tied to the degree to which evidenceis properly scientific.8.2. Clinical Research Evidence Should Form the Basis of Medical Decision-makingEBM proponents assume that clinical research evidence should form the basis of medicaldecision-making. This is in contrast with decision-making based on authority orpathophysiology.8.2.1. Not AuthorityAccording to EBM advocates, the way of the past with respect to medical decision-makinginvolved an appeal to authority and wisdom (in the form of accumulated years of clinicalexperience).59 The way of the future (EBM) \"puts a much lower value on authority\".60 They say,\"the underlying belief is that physicians can gain the skills to make independent assessments ofevidence and thus evaluate the credibility of opinions being offered by experts.\"61 In order to useEBM in clinical practice, physicians have to have a good understanding of the strengths andweakness of various clinical research methods (i.e. an awareness of the evidence hierarchy) andthe ability to formulate good questions, search the literature, critically appraise the quality andrelevance of the information, and convey the findings to the patient. This is essentially a solitaryprocess, with no need for input from authoritative experts or guidelines.8.2.2. Not PathophysiologyKnowledge about basic mechanisms of disease is insufficient as a foundation for clinicaldecision-making. Pathophysiologic reasoning (tracing possible causal mechanisms of disease 58 Ibid.59 Ibid.60 Ibid.61 Ibid.93based on accepted scientific theories) is contrasted with outcomes research (experimental andobservational clinical research), with the former more often leading to \"incorrect\" and\"inaccurate\" clinical predictions.62 The assumption is that outcomes research is less likely tolead to error in clinical decision-making. The focus of physicians is no longer whether we have aplausible biochemical or physical explanation for a particular treatment, but whether there arestudies showing that patients recover on a basis of the treatment. How something works hastaken a backseat to whether something works. To use the language proposed at the outset of thischapter, this reflects a shift away from rationalistic approaches to more empirical approaches inmedicine.8.3. A Hierarchy of Evidence is Necessary\"Understanding certain rules of evidence is necessary to correctly interpret literature oncausation, prognosis, diagnostic tests, and treatment strategy.\"63 The third assumption is thatphysicians need rules in order to correctly evaluate current medical evidence. Rules of evidence,according to this assumption, should be designed by experts (epidemiologists and statisticians,for instance) and then followed and applied by physicians. The practice of ranking differenttypes of evidence (as in the evidence hierarchy) is one that is thought to follow from scientificstandards. Note that this is not just the claim that it is helpful to be able to distinguish, forinstance, good from bad RCTs or better from worse cohort studies. This is an assumption aboutthe necessity of ranking these methods against one another so that a review of the literature willproduce one, hopefully decisive, answer.9. SummaryIn this chapter I outlined the history of EBM from its origins in clinical epidemiology to the shiftto an ostensibly more integrative version in recent years. I outlined the key features of theaccount, as proposed by members of the EBM working group, and I identified the three mainbackground assumptions of the movement. I will be looking in greater detail at the justifications 62 Ibid.63 Ibid.94offered for these assumptions in the next two chapters, since \"even if scientists are not concernedin their daily practice with directly justifying the assumptions that structure their reasoning,philosophers concerned with the nature of scientific knowledge must be.\"64 The historical recordof standards of evidence in medicine indicates that there has been a shift to empirical approachesin medicine in the last half century. Given this shift to empiricism within medicine, it isparticularly appropriate that critical contextual empiricism is the framework I am using tounderstand and critique current standards of medical evidence. 64 Longino, The Fate of Knowledge, 127.95Chapter FourCritiquing the Background Assumptions of Evidence-based Medicine: Part IValues filter into medical research at two recognized levels: the social level and the individuallevel. In the first case, for instance, funding agencies may influence the type of research that getsdone, who does it, and whether it is submitted for publication; in the second, researchers maydeliberately doctor trial methodologies, selectively present results, and allow their personalbiases to influence the outcome or presentation of evidence.1 In addition to the familiar ways inwhich values influence medical science, critical contextual empiricism (CCE) draws ourattention to the values that form the guiding background assumptions of inquiry. According toCCE, these assumptions are the most pervasive and yet least recognized sources of contextualvalues in science.2 In what follows I will critically evaluate two of the background assumptionsof EBM identified in the previous chapter: the assumption that medicine should be morescientific and the assumption that medical decision-making should be based on clinical researchevidence.3 With respect to the first assumption, I argue that: the characterization of scienceunderlying the drive to make medical research more scientific is inadequate; scientificapproaches to medical practice have not yet been shown to provide better patient outcomes; andmedical practice is committed to principles of shared decision-making and individualized carewhich are in tension with the demands of science as characterized. With respect to the secondassumption, I argue that while clinical research evidence was meant to replace authority inmedical decision-making it has become a new form of authority, and that pathophysiologicreasoning, and for that matter, a number of other factors, are as \"basic\" to clinical decision-making as research evidence.1. Should Medicine Be More Scientific? 1 Lemmens.2 Longino, Science as Social Knowledge, 60.3 I will be evaluating the third assumption - that a hierarchy of evidence is necessary - in the next chapter.96Proponents of EBM aim to make medicine more scientific. There are two distinct steps to thisprocess. First, they have to ensure that medical research is sufficiently scientific. Second, theyhave to tie medical practice to medical research. If medical research fails to be scientific enough,there is not much hope for medical practice. If medical practice is too artistic and humanistic,and thus disconnected from research, medicine as a whole will remain unscientific.41.1. Medical Research1.1.1. The Received View of ScienceIn order to ensure that medical research is sufficiently scientific, the EBM working group had tocome up with an account of \"good science\" and reorganize medical research to fit that account.The prevalent view reflected in popular culture is that medicine should be a science like anyother. This is the received view on the relationship between medicine and science. That is,medicine is situated alongside physics, biology and chemistry in the lexicon of science.Advocates of this position hold that there are laws, theories, hypotheses, and experiments inmedicine in much the same way as in other sciences, and that medicine is really a collection ofspecialized human sciences including for instance: molecular genetics, biochemistry, physiology,anatomy, pathology, clinical epidemiology and so on. According to the received view, theoriesare \"formalized axiom systems that (with the aid of boundary conditions and initial conditions)deductively organize specific subject areas in science, exhibiting empirical laws and individualoccurrences as logical consequences\".5 On this account, science is characterized as: empirical,systematic, objective, quantitative, and able to isolate simple causal relationships and produceuniversal (or at least probabilistic) laws or generalizations.1.1.2. EBM and Science 4 Whether or not medicine is a science, it will still be appropriate to evaluate it according to CCE. Despite the factthat Longino tends to write about science, the scope of her project is not limited to the critical evaluation ofscientific communities. Rather, she intends CCE to be useful in understanding and critically evaluating knowledge-producing communities generally. Longino writes, \"The argument of this book is directed explicitly at scientificknowledge. There are, however, reasons to see it as encompassing knowledge in general, or at least empiricalknowledge in general.\" Longino, The Fate of Knowledge, 2.5 Schaffner, 67. Schaffner is describing, not endorsing, this view.97I argue that advocates of the EBM movement are included among the proponents of the receivedview. Certain stereotypically scientific characteristics derived from science textbooks andpopular culture, and drawing on the received view outlined above, were assumed without criticaldebate and then imposed on medical research. The assumption underlying EBM is that medicineneeds to become scientific with the characteristics just listed. Many of these assumptions foundtheir way into the evidence hierarchy, as we will see in the next chapter. Unfortunately, thereceived view of science is highly problematic according to philosophers of science. I turn tothese concerns now.There is a significant body of literature demonstrating that the received view of science isuntenable when applied in certain domains. Biology and medicine, for instance, are not easilymade to produce universal laws and results via deductive logic, or isolate simple causalrelationships. This position, advanced in various forms by J.J. Smart, Philip Kitcher and KennethSchaffner, suggests that there are important differences between the biomedical sciences and thehard sciences of physics and chemistry. In his book Discovery and Explanation in Biology andMedicine, Schaffner identifies ways in which theories and laws in biology and medicine are notthe same as theories and laws in physics.6 He refers to theories in the biomedical sciences as\"theories of the middle range\" because they fall somewhere between the universal mechanismsof biochemistry and the universal generalizations of neo-Darwinian evolution.7 Schaffner arguesthat features of biological and human systems determine this difference. Biology and medicineare characterized as complex, \"vigorously interlevel\", \"less linear\", \"more reticulate,\" notproductive of universal claims in the traditional sense, unable to \"fully specify and control for allrelevant initial conditions,\" and are said to draw upon an \"overlapping series of interleveltemporal models\" rather than laws.8 Theories in these areas consist of a cluster of models andtheir consequences.9 Schaffner is concerned primarily with bench science in his descriptions, butthe view applies equally well to epidemiological research.This characterization of biology and medicine is argued to be more accurate, moreflexible and more fertile than the received view. Theories of the mid-range are still capable of allthe important epistemological features of physical and chemical theories, in have excess empirical content, they organize knowledge ininductive and sometimes even deductive ways, they change and are accepted andreplaced in accordance with rational canons, they have a generality that applies outsidetheir original domains (though this generality is frequently partial and complex), and theyare applicable for prediction and control in crucially important areas such as ... healthcare delivery.10Rather than concluding, on the basis of differences between, for instance, biology and physics,that biology fails to be scientific, Schaffner and others argue that we need a broader account ofscience. According to advocates of this position, medicine is a science, just a different andunusual kind of science. Medical researchers adhere to critical scientific principles such asprediction, empirical experimentation and generalization and are thus scientific enough to meritthe association.I propose an even stronger critique of the received view of science than is offered bySchaffner. Unfortunately, because Schaffner assumes that physics is the model science and isconcerned only with characterizing and assigning legitimacy to the differences found in biologyand medicine, his account fails to consider more revolutionary possibilities. A bettercharacterization is to suggest that none of the sciences can be taken as paradigmatic in the wayphysics is usually taken to be, and to recognize that each of the different sciences employsdifferent tools in order to gain knowledge about the empirical world. We do not have real or coresciences and other sciences; we have a range of sciences. And even in traditionally paradigmaticsciences, we cannot apply simplistic ideas about theories and laws. This argument draws supportfrom arguments in the philosophy of physics literature in recent years which indicate that it is notappropriate to talk about universal laws and pure deductive inference in any realm of science -even physics.11 This revelation exposes the misunderstanding underlying the attempt to finduniversal medical laws. Moreover, it suggests the need to pay attention to contextual differencesin various knowledge-productive realms rather than to find ways of factoring those differencesout. The medical domain is dominated by questions of specific individual effects. Attention tothese questions and the goals of medicine is critical to the success of any knowledge-productiveactivity in that domain. We have much to lose if this point is forgotten: 10 Ibid., 120.11 See for instance Cartwright, How the Laws of Physics Lie.99Characterizing as 'legitimate' biomedical theories only those theories that fit the analysismore appropriate for physics and chemistry would impoverish existing biomedicalscience and would methodologically misdirect ongoing research.12Medicine is a science unlike physics, but is no less a science as a result.The claim that EBM is more scientific than other approaches to decision-making inmedicine gets tossed around a lot in the literature without much careful attention to the scope andcontent of science.13 Medical research should be thought of as scientific because members of themedical research community share a commitment to empirical adequacy, and to certainprinciples of empirical evaluation. However medicine should not be assessed according to thesimilarities and differences between it and physics or chemistry. The proponents of EBM haveattempted to make medicine more scientific, and in doing so they have borrowed inappropriatelyfrom caricatures of the basic sciences. They have attempted to impose demands for law-likegeneralizations, quantified results, unbiased methods, and single-level causal phenomena in acontext where, as Schaffner demonstrates, these are not always possible or appropriate. As Inoted above, Schaffner has argued extensively, and persuasively, for the legitimacy of differentcharacterizations of biology and medicine as sciences. Biological and medical theories, forinstance, are conceptualized in relation to the specific and unique ways in which they discover,test, explain and justify facts about the empirical world. Attempts to impose inappropriatecharacterizations of science on medicine obscure these important differences. So while the goalof making medical research more scientific is admirable, the particular account of scienceimposed on medicine was, in the case of EBM, inappropriate and reflects an outdatedunderstanding of science. This does not preclude the development of a more accurate account ofscience, in line with my more radical reading of Schaffner's conclusions, and a strengthening ofthe relationship between medical research and this more accurate version of science. Furtherinvestigation into this possibility is warranted, though beyond the scope of this project. I discusssome of the specific implications of adopting stereotypically scientific characteristics in ChapterFive when I interrogate the assumptions underlying the evidence hierarchy. 12 Schaffner, 126.13 Daly, 1.1001.2. Medical PracticeI turn now to the second step: connecting medical research and medical practice. Sciences are allpartly knowledge-seeking endeavors and partly applied sciences. It is too easy to say that, forinstance, domains like medicine are applied sciences and thus separate from the pure sciences intheir attachment to the production of useful technologies. All scientific inquiry is pervasivelyinfluenced by social values, interests, expectations and goals. We cannot separate pure inquiryinto the empirical world from the applications that drive inquiry in all fields. Recognition of thepartly knowledge-productive and partly technologically-productive nature of inquiry todayallows us to properly assign responsibility to researchers and all interested stakeholders andcommunity members, including the public. Though no domain of science is immune frompractical expectations, some particular domains might be further removed from suchexpectations than others. Thus while all science contains knowledge-productive andtechnologically-productive tendencies, some are weighted more heavily to the production oftechnological interventions.Medical practice is probably closer to the applied end of the spectrum than medicalresearch. Medical practice is problem-driven and usually aims not for general knowledge but forspecific, individually appropriate applications of knowledge to particular patients. Medicalpractice does not, primarily, aim to expand existing knowledge, but to apply it in order to solvereal-world problems, most notably the relief of diseases in individuals.14 This is not unlike therelationship between theoretical physics and engineering, or theories in ecology and ecosystemmanagement. While theoretical frameworks are developed and hypotheses generated and testedwithin the more-theoretical domain (for instance physics or ecology), the results of theseinvestigations are put into practice in the more-practical domain (for instance engineering orecosystem management). The relationship is complex, however, in that the needs and goals ofthe practical realm inform the research projects of the theoretical realm. Further, engineers andecosystem managers know better than to directly apply the results of theoretical investigations in 14 The situation is undoubtedly more complicated than this. Physicians receive new information from every patient(thus building up their knowledge of the differences in presentation of various diseases and increasing their 'clinicalexpertise'), and thus medical practice itself is partly knowledge-productive. This is captured in my description ofmedical practice as closer to the technological/applied end of the spectrum (because this still contains a knowledge-productive element). Recall that while this means medicine is partly scientific, I am using my revised-Schaffnerianaccount of science here (not the received view).101the practical domain. A great deal of careful re-contextualization (for instance, adding real forcessuch as friction to equations in engineering) is necessary in order to bridge theory and practice.The desire to make medicine more scientific seems to require a closer relationshipbetween medical practice and medical research than was traditionally the case. This is theargument made by EBM proponents. In order to tighten the connections between research andpractice, EBM proposes a series of clinical practice rules (outlined in Chapter Three) that advisephysicians to consult the research literature whenever possible in the care of individual patients.This is, in a sense, designed to re-contextualize the theoretical results in a similar manner to there-introduction of friction to equations in engineering. In the earliest formulations of EBM,physicians were to apply the results of research in practice, and though later versions talkedabout integration of research with other factors, the desire to connect research and practicepersists. In what follows I will take a closer look at some of the reasons why the particular driveto bind medical practice to medical research is problematic.1.2.1. Patient OutcomesEven if tying medical practice to medical research (where medical research is sufficientlyscientific) were to make medical practice more scientific by association, it is not at all clear thatthis would ensure better patient outcomes in medical practice. Empirical evidence of thisconnection is lacking, and it is not at all clear why we would assume that tying medical practiceto medical research would be good for patients. This is commonly raised as an ironic problem forEBM: there isn't any empirical evidence to indicate that EBM is a more successful approach toindividual patient care. EBM advocates rely on common sense and expert assessments to suggestthat they are on the right track.EBM advocates are currently in the process of collecting evidence on whether EBM leadsto better patient outcomes. So far, evidence indicating the effectiveness of EBM is limited to theresults of observational research. This is clearly a matter of some consternation for the advocatesof EBM. In the most recent edition of the EBM handbook, Straus and colleagues lament thechallenges of producing evidence for evidence-based medicine. They point out that in order toevaluate EBM they need to define a precise intervention, an appropriate dose, and a clearoutcome. Unfortunately, these details are hard to work out. The intervention is \"difficult to102define\", it is \"unclear what the appropriate 'dose', 'formulation', 'frequency', or 'route' shouldbe\", and it is difficult to determine which outcomes to measure since EBM produces a \"widerange of outcomes\", some of which are \"harder to confirm\" than others.15 In addition, the authorsmake a point of noting that \"learners have different learning needs and styles, and thesedifferences must be reflected in the educational experiences provided\"; in other words, the'treatment' under investigation needs to be individualized and cannot be applied across a groupof people without due consideration of individual differences.16 Further, the authors point out thatknowledge translation is a complex process and in order to change behaviour a comprehensiveapproach would be needed, within which the provision of evidence is \"but one component.\"17Finally, the authors admit that because EBM requires lifelong learning, it is possible that \"it isnot something that can be measured over the short-term.\"18Presumably this is all in contrast to medical treatments. Apparently, according to Strausand colleagues, it is reasonable to suppose that human bodies are so simple, interventions are sostraightforward, and outcomes are so unproblematic and uncomplicated that designing researchto investigate treatments is no problem at all. Consider, for a moment, the challenges faced byresearchers investigating therapeutic counseling for patients suffering from depression. In thedesign of research, investigators will face challenges in setting outcomes, standardizingtreatment, incorporating all elements of the treatment into the analysis and pursuing thecounseling for an appropriately long period of time. It would seem that the same sorts ofproblems raised in research on EBM are encountered in the investigation of some types ofmedical treatments.Straus and colleagues suggest that the problems encountered in the evaluation of EBMare idiosyncratic. This is false. The idea that these problems are unique and arise only in the casewhere we are evaluating EBM is preposterous and even dangerous. While I applaud Straus andcolleagues for recognizing and describing the problems encountered in attempts to researchEBM, it is astonishing that they do not consider these to be systemic problems worthy of further 15 Straus et al., 7.16 Ibid., 7.17 Ibid., 8.18 Ibid. On a personal note, the hypocrisy of these statements reminds me of the way comedian John Stewart usesclips of current U.S. president George W. Bush. He often plays a clip of the president making a dogmatic claim,followed by a more recent clip of him making the opposite claim (just as dogmatically). And then he just pauses andlooks confused. I have attempted a more academic tone in my reply, though the sentiment is probably the same.103discussion.19 Insofar as similar challenges arise in the evaluation of certain medical treatments,those problems will be systematic in evidence-based research. This exposes the hypocrisy ofEBM in demanding that all research conform to standards of best evidence, since it is clear thatcertain types of research questions are not amenable to best standards as defined, and that theresults of such research are no less important or meaningful as a result of this difference. Insteadof lamenting their inability to perform RCTs, proponents of EBM should get on with the task ofinvestigating EBM with rigorous observational methods, and value the results of such researchaccordingly. I discuss the importance of the right research design for a particular question furtherin Chapter Five.1.2.2. Individualized CareThe roots of medical practice are captured in the famous saying attributed to Hippocrates, \"It ismore important to know what kind of person has the disease than what kind of disease the personhas.\" In contrast with this highly personalized philosophy of medicine, EBM suggests thatmedical practice should be based on the generalized results of clinical research. According to thehierarchy, for instance, meta-analyses of RCTs provide excellent evidence, and case-studiesprovide the worst. In other words, the larger, more abstract general studies provide betterevidence and thus guides to practice than do carefully developed, detailed individual studies. Thehierarchy has a clear 'general to specific' orientation. As it turns out, however, 1) it is not easy todefend the claim that certain research designs are more generalizable than others 2) thisgeneralizability, if achieved, may actually be a liability in practice.Let's start with the standard argument for the generalizability of the highest rankedresearch methods. Because the RCT is performed on a group of individuals (often quite a largegroup) and collects average patient data across that group, the average patient data obtained froman RCT is more likely to be generalizable to members of the general population than the dataobtained from one particular individual in a case study. This is thought to extend even further inthe case of meta-analyses of RCTs. For all we know, the individual in the case study may have 19 In the subsequent section of the book, Straus and colleagues consider the limitations of EBM (in about a page) andnone of the problems above are even mentioned. Instead, they superficially dismiss a few common concerns aboutEBM as cookbook medicine, the contention that it is an 'ivory tower' approach, and potential economic abuses ofEBM. The only limitations on EBM that the authors acknowledge are practical (skill development and timeconstraints).104been an exception to the norm. In an RCT, the exceptional and the usual are averaged to produceone result: the average efficacy of a particular therapeutic intervention.20 And in a meta-analysis,the results of a variety of RCTs are averaged again. Proponents of EBM offer the followingadvice about applying the results of such research to practice,[A]sk whether there is some compelling reason why the results should not be applied tothe patient. A compelling reason usually won't be found, and most often you cangeneralize the results to your patient with confidence.21There is a great deal of confidence in the strength of the connection between the results ofresearch and the demands of clinical practice. However, these claims to generalizabilty are not sostraightforward.Subjects in RCTs are not randomly sampled from the general population. In fact, thesubjects enrolled into clinical trials are often quite unreflective of the members of the generalpopulation or even the target population for a treatment. While it is sometimes possible to designa trial in which the trial population is purposely matched to the target population for thetreatment (at least, as closely as possible), it is uncommon for a number of reasons. First,members of the target population often have a number of comorbidities (concurrent conditions).22It is more difficult to isolate a cause-effect relationship when many other variables (includingother medications) are added into the equation. These sorts of comorbidities are, accordingly,seen as a liability for the trial. Researchers often explicitly request subjects who have no otherconditions and are taking no other medications.23 Second, members of the target population areoften elderly and likely to be put on a treatment for long periods of time or even indefinitely. Sothe target population would be long-time users of the treatment. However RCTs are usually quiteshort in duration (ranging from a few weeks to a few months long). There is a gap between theshort-term data produced by RCTs and the long-term use by the target population. The data fromRCTs, then, is not easily generalized to the standard patient. Third, it is common for researchersto select their study population in a way that allows them to test the healthiest people. The 20 In other cases, exceptional cases may dismissed as outliers or attributed to errors in the design of the trial.21 Guyatt, Sackett, and Cook, \"How to Use an Article About Therapy or Prevention.\"22 For instance, people who are mentally ill often have problems with drug addiction and this makes it difficult toisolate new treatments for mental illnesses.23 These 'clean' subjects are increasingly difficult to find in North America. The search for clean research subjectshas led many large pharmaceutical companies to the developing world, though while developing world subjects areoften free of other medications, they are more likely to have concurrent conditions such as malnutrition.105selection of 18-35 year-old subjects (and sometimes an even narrower range) means that,because in general these subjects are healthier than older people, they are less likely to haveadverse reactions to the drug. The healthier a person is, the less pronounced the adverse reaction(in general) and more positive the overall reaction. Again, this means the trial population isdifferent from the target population. Fourth, research trials are often conducted in contexts thatdiffer in significant ways from the contexts of general practice. As a result, therapy may beadministered and monitored in a way that cannot be easily replicated. Research is oftenconducted at facilities with more resources, and implementation of treatments in contexts whereresources are scarce is not straightforward. This contributes to a gap between individual patientsand the promises of benefit attributed to particular treatments.Even if we were to set aside these concerns about the generalizability of research fromRCTs, we would still be left with concerns about the gap between generalized results andindividual patients. This gap between the results of generalized clinical research evidence andcomplex individual patient care has been raised time and again in medical literature. Feinsteinand Horwitz remind us that, \"When transferred to clinical medicine from an origin in agriculturalresearch, randomized trials were not intended to answer questions about the treatment ofindividual patients.\"24 Patients are idiosyncratic individuals dealing with multiple complexproblems. The most scientific medical research by EBM standards produces averagegeneralizations across homogenous populations that, as discussed, often fail to resemble thepatient because of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The highest ranked clinical research focuseson large-scale studies designed to determine simple causal relationships between treatments andtheir effects. In many cases, a particular patient would never have qualified for the study becausehe or she has comorbidities, or does not meet certain age or gender specifications. As Tonellipoints out:Clinical research, as currently envisioned, must inevitably ignore what may be important, yetnon-quantifiable, differences between individuals. Defining medical knowledge solely on thebasis of such studies, then, would necessarily eliminate the importance of individual variationfrom the practice of medicine.25 24 Feinstein and medicine,\" 1237.106If we pay attention to average outcomes, we may lose sight of significant variation within thetrial population. It may be that some subjects responded well, while others responded poorly.Though on average this looks like no effect, this is not a full characterization of what hasoccurred.26 In fact, important subgroup data will likely be missed. Just as it would beinappropriate for engineers to apply theories in theoretical physics to the construction of bridgeswithout any contextual specifications, it is inappropriate for physicians to apply the results ofmedical research in practice without attention to the medical context. The applicability ofscientific evidence, especially large-scale, single-factor studies, \"depends on the individual beingconformable to the group in all relevant aspects,\" which is rarely the case.27 On the basis of theseconcerns, I argue that simply binding medical practice to medical research fails to capture theimportance, difficulty, and skills required for re-contextualizing and individualizing medicalknowledge. This is not to say that medical practice will not benefit from thoughtful and criticaluse of a wide variety of results from medical research, but that is not what has been proposed.The critique I am offering here is directed not at a general claim that medical practice should payattention to medical research (which I take to be a good position), but at the specific rules tyingmedical practice to medical research in EBM, which I argue fail to capture important distinctelements of medical practice.1.2.3. Shared Decision-makingThe move toward a more inclusive decision-making process that has been occurring in medicineover the last half century has forced physicians to become more aware of the inherent limits anduncertainty of medical decision-making. Recent attention to bioethical principles of autonomyand informed decision-making have pushed the medical model away from doctor-knows-bestpaternalism and raised new questions about the role of patients in medical decision-making. Themore we recognize the role of patients' values in medical decision-making, the further theoriginal EBM project is from the reality of practice. Even if there are biological similaritiesbetween several different cases of a disease, the values and other non-quantifiable factorsintroduced by each of the individual patients could and should radically shift the medical 26 Cartwright, Nature's Capacities and Their Measurement, 104.27 Black, \"The limitations of evidence,\" 1.107decision being made. No matter how decisive the evidence is, without patient input there is noclear best decision. Furthermore, the patient's subjective experience of illness is an importantpart of the clinical encounter (and the source of his or her desire for treatment) and so shouldform the basis for discussion about treatment and for the evaluation of objectives and desiredoutcomes of treatment. These elements of medical decisions require the careful development oflistening skills and compassion on the part of the physician and indicate the importance ofelements besides scientific evidence to the successful practice of medicine.28It is unclear how the sort of medical practice advocated by EBM fits with existingstandards of shared decision-making and patient-centered care. Shared decision-making impliesa shift in the burden of health care work. Patients become part-time (unpaid) health care workersas they search out evidence online, solicit advice from friends, and devote time to carefulconsideration of their values. Shared decision-making is often justified on the basis of theprinciple of autonomy (respect for persons). But how are the results of the patient's workintegrated within evidence-based practice? It is clear that patients often highly value anecdotalevidence. If a health problem affected a patient's friend, sister or grandfather, he or she will bemuch more likely to attach significant weight to that piece of evidence. Should the anecdotes andintuitions of patients carry any greater weight than those of physicians, which have beenexplicitly condemned under the EBM model? This seems unlikely, particularly since theseanecdotes and intuitions are supremely unscientific by EBM standards. Should the values ofpatients be permitted to override best research evidence?29 In these situations, it will be temptingfor physicians to strongly guide patients to the correct evidence from clinical trials and meta-analyses (indeed, this may be required by EBM). There appears to be, at the very least, a tensionbetween commitments to shared decision-making and the rules of EBM.The initial formulation of EBM seemed to require an almost algorithmic approach todecision-making according to which individual physicians assess the evidence then apply it tothe particular case. The later versions of EBM arguably deal with the need for individualizedcare, as well as the importance of incorporating patient values by suggesting that medicalresearch should be \"conscientiously\" and \"judiciously\" applied to patients. While this tempers 28 The balance between measurement and meaning is an important one for medicine. Upshur, VandenKerkof andGoel.29 It is worth keeping in mind here that these values may have already been influenced by direct-to-consumeradvertising of pharmaceuticals (particularly in the U.S.) and by self-diagnosis on the basis of on-line questionnairesprovided by the makers of various medical treatments.108the claim it does not retract it. Medical practice is still assumed to be best when it is based onmedical research. The integrative concessions were meant to leave some room in the medicaldecision-making process for patient values, but patient-centered care and shared decision-makingrequires more than this. If we take patient-centered care seriously, best evidence will varydepending on the values of the patient and the nature and context of illness. This appears to callinto question the basic nature of best evidence. Physicians who emphasize the patient's role inthe decision-making process are likely to resist the standardization implicit in the more scientificapproach advocated by EBM.2. Should Clinical Research Evidence Form the Basis of Medical Decision-making?According to EBM, clinical decision-making should be based on the results of clinical research.In what follows I consider other possible \"bases\" for decision-making.2.1. Not Authority?In spite of a stated desire to diminish the reliance of physicians on the authority of others, theEBM movement has resulted in the creation of a number of new authorities. The CochraneCollaboration, founded in 1993, is a volunteer-driven organization whose members performsystematic analyses of the literature and disseminate the results to fellow health careprofessionals. The main products of the collaboration are systematic reviews - primarily ofRCTs - which are updated and added to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews everythree months. Various organizations have followed the Cochrane model, such as the NationalGuideline Clearinghouse in the U.S. and over 40 guideline-producing organizations in Canada,prompting further clarification on the appropriate \"guidelines for guidelines\" and conferences onmethods of systematic review.30 The production of reviews and guidelines has led to a new typeof evidence-based practitioner in recent years. It is not uncommon to find physicians claiming topractice EBM who rely entirely on reviews and guidelines produced by others. EBM users, as 30 Canadian Medical Association Infobase.109they have been called, contract out the critical evaluation step originally outlined by EBMproponents.31This approach to EBM is efficient, but in cutting out the critical evaluation physiciansonce again put themselves in a position of subservience to authority. In this case it is theauthority of those who produce systematic reviews and guidelines, but given that there willalways be social and political pressures on those producing the reviews and guidelines, thisseems to be a risky endeavor. In establishing pre-digested reviews and guidelines as the newauthority, EBM users once again drift away from the demands of critical thinking. Whenever thisoccurs, there is reason for concern.32 These new authorities, draped in claims to scientificobjectivity, serve a similar function to that traditionally occupied by older, more-experiencedclinicians in the \"old paradigm\". The authority of the past has been replaced not by a newdemocratic spirit in medicine, but by new forms of authority. I will leave analysis of why this hasoccurred to my colleagues in the social sciences. It will suffice to note that, as EBM becomes thenew authority in medicine, it no longer fulfills its own claims to anti-authoritarianism.2.2. Not Pathophysiology?EBM proponents make a number of strong statements about the fallibility of pathophysiologicreasoning, for instance:Millions of dollars' worth of bench research that appeared to show a reduction inatherosclerosis-related oxidative stress with vitamin E therapy was recently tested in anRCT that asked the vital question: Does the vitamin E therapy endorsed by this researchreally help prevent heart disease? The answer was a resounding 'No'.33Predictions about intervention effects on clinically important outcomes based onphysiologic experiments usually are right, but occasionally are disastrously wrong. Weprovide a number of examples of just how wrong predictions based on physiologicrationale can be in Part 2B1, 'Therapy and Validity, Surprising Results of RandomizedControlled Trials.34 31 Upshur, \"If not evidence, then what? Or does medicine really need a base?\"32 A recent article by David Cundiff on the financial interests influencing members of the Cochrane Collaborationmakes this point well: Cundiff, 56.33 Sackett, \"Time to Canadian Institutes of Health Research on trial,\" 1414.34 Guyatt, Rennie, 6. Note the implication that clinical trials are never \"disastrously wrong\". This will be discussedfurther in Chapter Four.110Robyn Bluhm has argued convincingly that high level clinical research is dependent on scientificresearch done in laboratories. Bench science is vital to clinical research because it allowsresearchers to make causal claims, investigate why outcomes occur and understand subgroupvariation in RCTs. 35 This also means bench science is important for clinical practice since on thebasis of the advantages just listed it allows physicians to more judiciously apply the averageresults of epidemiological investigations to individual patients.36 And this is all on top of theusual claim that bench research is important for hypothesis generation. Pathophysiologicresearch (bench science research) is lowest on the evidence hierarchy yet it would seem that itcould complement research at other levels in the hierarchy in order to provide more robustsupport for clinical decisions than that provided by research evidence alone. The currentevidence hierarchy and admonishments about the use of pathophysiology in clinical practiceneglect this relationship.2.2.1. Relationship Between Bench Science and Clinical ResearchThe uneasy and inconsistent relationship between EBM and the laboratory or bench sciences canbe demonstrated in several ways. Common life-saving medical treatments, such as fluids fordehydration, blood transfusions for loss of blood, electric shocks to restart the heart, andantibiotics for pneumonia have never been tested in RCTs. What these interventions have incommon is that when they were first attempted there was a dramatic positive effect. Because it isunlikely that unknown confounding factors caused the observed effect, because there is a clearmechanism that seems to underlie the treatment, and because these interventions have been usedto great acclaim for decades and in some cases centuries, we do not think it is necessary toinvestigate them further. As a result, in spite of their impressive pedigree, these interventionshave never been rigorously, systematically investigated by researchers in clinical trials. They arecurrently grandfathered into medical practice under the dubious category of \"self-evident\"interventions. 35 I use the terms laboratory and bench science interchangeably. These sciences (for example, biochemistry andmolecular genetics) investigate biological mechanisms.36 Bluhm, \"From Hierarchy to Network: A richer view of evidence for evidence-based medicine.\" This relationshipgoes two ways. For instance, we are especially interested in the particular carcinogens in tobacco smoke because weknow from epidemiological research that tobacco smoke can lead to cancer. Vandenbroucke, \"Medical journals andthe shaping of medical knowledge.\"111If EBM proponents are to be consistent in upholding their hierarchy of evidence theyhave to admit that such interventions are ranked somewhere - probably at the bottom of theevidence hierarchy. The build up of knowledge through trial and error over many years earnsonly the lowest ranking. This seems strange, given that we are more certain of these treatmentsthan many others offered in hospitals today, and because we think of the hierarchy as indicatingwhat degree of belief we should have about interventions. These interventions are widelyaccepted on the basis of our current understanding of pathophysiology - an understanding that, itis worth keeping in mind, we didn't always have. It would, of course, be unethical to randomizepeople to non-treatment in order to investigate these treatments today. Further, it would be silly,since we know these treatments work. I think even staunch EBM advocates would acknowledgethat they know these treatments work. But where is this knowledge coming from? If we aresupposed to gain medical knowledge through the hierarchy, and the basic sciences andunsystematic trial and error are ranked near the bottom, does this mean we only have weakknowledge of these interventions? Should we hope for better? This is also problematic when weconsider the implications for the future of medicine. Were we to have the good fortune tostumble upon an intervention with the dramatic power of penicillin today, what would we requirein terms of evidence of effectiveness? If we require an RCT, are we prepared to accept the lossof lives in the control group? There are undoubtedly going to be lives lost in the initial trial anderror evaluation of any treatment, but to follow this with systematic harm through an RCTappears questionable (as it did in the ECMO case outlined in the introduction to the dissertation).These are important questions that get to the heart of the ambiguity of EBM on the value ofevidence that we \"already know\" to be good.2.2.1.1. HomeopathyThe hypocrisy of EBM with respect to bench science is nowhere as evident as in the debates overhomeopathy. Though the complexities of the homeopathy debate extend beyond what I will beable to address here, I think it is an important example for bringing out the hidden reliance onbench science within EBM. Homeopathy is an alternative system of medicine that originated inGermany in the late 18th century. It has been experiencing resurgence in North America after aperiod of relative inattention, which was the result of suppression by the mainstream medical112community in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Homeopathic practitionersprescribe treatments designed to stimulate the body's natural healing response by treating \"likewith like\". The homeopathic substances (parts of plants, minerals or animals) are diluted toinfinitesimal amounts through a process of \"potentization\" and offered to patients, usually in theform of small sugar pills. Remedies first undergo \"provings\" in healthy subjects and thesymptoms that arise in the healthy patients indicate what the remedy will cure in an ill person.So, for example, if diluted rhubarb produces a fever and rash when ingested by a healthy subject,it will stimulate the healing response of someone who suffers from a similar type of fever andrash. There are many other details of this unusual system, but the main point of contention forconventional medical researchers is the ultra-high dilution (UHD) of the 'active' ingredients.37Many homeopathic remedies are diluted to the point that not even one molecule of the originalsubstance remains (i.e. beyond Avogadro's number). Thus the treatment is biochemicallynothing more than a sugar pill.38 Contrary to the dose-response law in chemistry, homeopathsclaim that increasing dilution actually makes the remedy more potent. Obviously this does not sitwell with chemists. There is also a lack of explanation for how and why homeopathy works, inthe trials where it does appear to work.39 Of course, this lack of explanation is not uncommon inmedical research. When coupled with the dose-response problem, though, this gives rise toheated criticisms of homeopathy in the mainstream scientific literature.40What is especially interesting, however, is the mainstream scientific response to RCTsand meta-analyses on homeopathy. While the most recent meta-analysis seems to indicate thathomeopathy has no specific effect beyond placebo, there have been earlier meta-analyses -notably one published in The Lancet in 1997 - that indicated a slight positive effect ofhomeopathy.41 The publication of the 1997 meta-analysis provoked a tremendous response fromthe medical community. Critics attacked the methods of the review, the credibility of the authors, 37 There are also concerns about the principle that \"like cures like.\"38 Ernst and others have suggested that the effects of homeopathy are likely to be non-specific effects. This would beconsistent with the position that it is not the biochemical nature of the pill but rather the nature of homeopathicconsultations that have an effect (when there is an effect).39 Some claims about the memory of water or crystalline structures in water have been advanced but have not yetbeen supported by independent empirical evidence. The most famous of these, which was widely critiqued in thescientific literature, was Michael Schiff's The Memory of Water.40 The skeptic website Quackwatch has even set up an additional site to specifically address homeopathy:www.homeowatch.org.41 Linde et al.113and the motivation for the trial.42 A 2005 meta-analysis of RCTs (also published in The Lancet)that came with a press release \"homeopathy is no better than placebo\" has not received similarcritical attention from the mainstream medical community but rather has been widely celebratedand disseminated.43 The two studies were both meta-analyses: they both used roughly the samemethods of evaluation. Yet the only conclusion that was accepted was the one supported bycurrent theories in pharmacology and chemistry. Members of the CAM research communityhave drawn some attention to this difference in attitude.44Whenever a randomized controlled trial or meta-analysis of RCTs on homeopathyappears in a respected scientific journal, skeptics subject the trial to scrutiny and criticalevaluation beyond that which, for instance, a new drug would receive. Singling out homeopathyfor this extra-rigorous critique, while refraining from judgement on similarly-designed drug trialscannot be justified by the lack of mechanism for homeopathy since, as I mentioned earlier, it isnot uncommon for the full mechanisms of drugs to be unknown (particularly psychiatric drugs).45What is at the core of objections is the fact that homeopathy is inconsistent with current benchscience (i.e. laws of chemistry and pharmacology). If the standards of EBM were all that wasnecessary to evaluate new treatments - that is, if all we really cared about is what worksregardless of mechanisms - homeopathy should have been adopted to the same extent as drugstested in similar trials when the 1997 meta-analysis was published.I am not suggesting that this should have occurred. What I am saying is that theadvocates of EBM can't have their cake and eat it too, so to speak. They can't say that onlyoutcomes matter (and devalue research on biological mechanisms) and then turn around and uselack of biological mechanisms, or inconsistency of claims about mechanisms, as the basis forrejecting homeopathy.46 Pathophysiologic principles do have a role to play in the evaluation ofclinical research, and in medical decision-making. There is no reason to suggest that the 42 Vandenbroucke, \"Homeopathy trials: going nowhere\"; of homeopathy,\" 690.44 Bell.45 We often know the mechanism at the basic receptor level (from in vivo studies) and the basic metabolic pathways(from animal research), but we still do not know all of the effects that a drug has in the body, or even the ones thatmake it effective. Thanks to Robyn Bluhm for clarification on this point.46 Similarly, they cannot call in Bayesianism to save them by suggesting that homeopathy has low priors whilemaintaining a commitment to traditional statistics and otherwise ignoring the insights offered by Bayesians onclinical research more generally.114complementary relationship between bench and clinical research warrants the designation of oneas the base of medicine.2.2.1.2. Na\u00efve EmpiricismEBM is only superficially an empiricist approach to medicine.47 Because it lacks an explicittheoretical framework that connects bench science, epidemiology and everything in between, it isunable to address the problems identified above. In addition, the na\u00efve empiricism of EBMsuggests the irony in its choice of moniker. Evidence-based medicine cannot be accused ofignoring evidence. But it fails to get us anything more than that. More specifically, EBM fails tooffer us explanations, since explanations require an answer to why questions. But the proponentsof EBM seemed aware of this, at least before things spun out of their control. The followingquote, taken from a publication by Sackett and colleagues a year before the infamous EBMmanifesto says,If, in the final analysis, the practice of this \"science of the art of medicine\" is to do moregood than harm to patients and clinicians, five additional ingredients must be added to thestudy of this book. First, its elements must be integrated with those of the other basicsciences, such as morphology, physiology, and biochemistry, as they are applied; werethe approaches presented here to constitute the sole scientific basis for clinical action, wewould simply be substituting a new tyranny of unachievable methodologic rigor for theold tyranny of unteachable clinical art.48Two things are noteworthy here. First, the authors who wrote this insightful comment describeclinical epidemiology not as an expansion of the existing science of medicine, but as asupplement to the art of medicine. Second, the authors clearly state the importance ofunderstanding clinical epidemiology in context, and yet a year later they initiate a movementthat, due in large part to the placement of basic scientific research very low on the evidencehierarchy, led to a derogation of basic scientific research within medicine. The wisdom of thisearly statement needs to be more widely recognized, and the intervening errors corrected. 47 See Chapter One of Robyn Bluhm's dissertation for further discussion on this point: \"The 'hierarchy of evidence'and the structure for ClinicalMedicine, xiv-xv.1152.2.1.3. Theoretical FrameworkThe domain of medicine contains three interrelated elements: bench research, clinical researchand clinical practice. While EBM has much to say about the relationship between clinicalresearch and practice it has almost nothing - certainly not much that is positive - to say aboutbench research. As I noted in the last chapter, EBM places basic scientific research at the bottomof the evidence hierarchy, when it is ranked at all. It is also sometimes referred to as a creativerealm which supplies hypothesis for proper clinical epidemiological evaluation.49 Thejustificatory power of bench science is thought to be very limited. Evidence-based medicine is anattempt to strengthen the connection between clinical research and clinical practice, as well as tospecify the appropriate ordering and content of clinical research. The relatively new field ofclinical epidemiology, culminating in EBM, prioritized questions that ask whether treatmentswork. This was done at the expense of significant attention to why and how treatments work.Attempts to answer the latter question, and provide explanations for events, are critical elementsin the construction of theories and models in medicine.What is the cost of having no theory, or of pretending that theoretical frameworks do notexist? First of all, without a theoretical framework (even in the modest sense of having a range ofmodels upon which to draw) it is impossible to respond to the homeopathy problem withouthypocrisy. Second, without a theoretical framework it becomes very difficult to identify errors.In effect, what happens in clinical research is continual trial and error, with no feedbackmechanism to integrate these findings with other findings, or to generate new hypotheses as aresult. This leads to the third cost: without a theoretical framework the chances of innovation aresignificantly decreased. Because clinical research in this narrow sense is restricted to posingquestions about \"what works\", it is unable to modify and reformulate the theoretical frameworkfrom which these questions should be generated. Explicit attention to the connections betweenmedical theories and clinical research is vital for progress.50 Marcia Angell, former editor of theNew England Journal of Medicine, has argued that the greatest challenge facing medicine todayis a lack of innovation. This is not a surprise. This is very much a product of a medical researchprogram that valorizes clinical research at the expense of theoretical research. We cannot simply 49 Wennberg.50 I am indebted to discussions in Paul Thompson and Ross Upshur's Philosophy of Medicine class at the Universityof Toronto for clarification on these problems.116repeat a process of trial and error continuously and hope to come to any comprehensiveunderstanding of health and disease.2.3. Why a Base?Does medicine really need a base, whether it is clinical research evidence, authority,pathophysiology or something else? Given the number of different elements that factor intoclinical decision-making, what is to be gained by prioritizing one? Ross Upshur has argued thatthe foundationalism assumed by proponents of EBM is ill-suited to the task of guiding medicaldecision-making.51 Physicians have to incorporate pathophysiologic principles, clinical researchevidence, personal experience, intuition, patient values, economic constraints, administrativerestrictions, and many other factors when making medical decisions. All of these components areimportant, and any decision that failed to take all of these factors into account would be poorlyinformed. The motivation for declaring one of these a \"base\" appears to be largely rhetorical,given that EBM proponents have more recently admitted the need for integration of clinicalresearch evidence with these other factors. It is also inappropriate, given the hidden reliance onpathophysiology in medical research and the commitment to shared decision-making and respectfor patient values, as well as the importance of clinical expertise, in medical practice.3. SummaryIn this chapter I critically evaluated the first two background assumptions of EBM: medicineshould be more scientific (given a particular understanding of science) and clinical researchshould form the basis of medical decision-making. In each case I argued that the assumption isflawed. This does not mean that I am arguing for a less scientific approach to medicine, or that Iwould direct physicians to ignore the results of clinical research. On the contrary, I think a morenuanced appreciation of scientific reasoning as it occurs in the medical context, and greaterawareness of the variety of research methods in medicine would be a vast improvement inmedicine. But this is not what is being suggested by EBM, and not what forms the content of thebackground assumptions presupposed by EBM. Rather, EBM proposes a narrow and restricted 51 Upshur, \"If not evidence, then what? Or does medicine really need a base?\"117account of science, a paternalistic and simplified account of clinical decision-making, and ana\u00efve empiricism regarding the products of medical research. In this chapter I argue that the firsttwo background assumptions of EBM are flawed. In the next chapter I will critically examine thethird assumption of EBM.118Chapter FiveCritiquing the Background Assumptions of Evidence-based Medicine: Part IIProponents of EBM assume that a hierarchy of evidence is needed to guide medical research andpractice. However, the particular evidence hierarchy advanced by EBM is only one of manypossible hierarchies. If, for example, the values of complexity and individuality were thoughtmost indicative of high quality evidence in medicine, the evidence hierarchy might have beeninverted. In fact, recent developments in medicine have led to a proliferation of differentevidence hierarchies.1 In light of the variety of possible and actual evidence hierarchies, theparticular version offered by EBM needs to be justified. Advocates of EBM have not beenforthcoming on this issue. Because of this, I attempt to reconstruct the most plausiblejustifications based on comments in the original JAMA and BMJ articles on EBM, the EBMhandbook Evidence-based Medicine: How to Practice and Teach EBM and the Users' Guides tothe Medical Literature.2 According to my analysis, the evidence hierarchy for medical treatmentsorganizes research methods according to their ability to produce results that are: precise,randomized, unbiased, quantified and relatively certain. In this chapter I critically examine eachof these justifications for the current evidence hierarchy.3In the first section of the chapter, I argue that the proponents of EBM ranked researchmethods in part by their ability to produce precise results. I then critique this assumption. In thesecond section, I evaluate claims about the epistemic value of randomization and suggest thatrandomization does not secure many of the epistemic benefits promised by advocates. As aresult, randomization is excluded as a justification for the evidence hierarchy. Third, I argue thatresearch methods ranked highest in the hierarchy provide no greater guarantee that biases havebeen eliminated than those below. This excludes justifications on the basis of objectivity ofresults. Fourth, I critique the fixation on quantitative methods underlying the evidence hierarchy 1 Upshur, \"Are all evidence-based Sackett et al. \"Evidence Based Medicine: What itis and What it Isn't\"; Guyatt and Rennie Users' Guide to the Medical Literature; Straus et al. Evidence-basedMedicine: How to Practice and Teach EBM.3 As noted in the introduction to the dissertation, I am focusing here on the hierarchy for medical treatments. Thereare also hierarchies for diagnosis and prognosis, for instance.119and demonstrate the value of qualitative methods. Fifth, I consider whether the evidencehierarchy provides physicians with more certainty in practice and argue that uncertainty isineliminable in medicine and that the evidence hierarchy could enable a dangerous and falsesense of certainty. In light of the cumulative effect of these arguments, I conclude that the currentevidence hierarchy is unjustified.4 Finally, I argue that not only is this particular hierarchyunjustified, but that any attempt to rank research methods is incoherent and ultimatelydetrimental to medical research and practice.1. PrecisionAccording to the hierarchy outlined in Chapter Three, the highest quality of evidence achievablein medicine is that produced by systematic reviews. Systematic reviews are thought to beadvantageous because they minimize bias, assimilate large amounts of information, reduce thedelay in translating evidence into practice, and establish the generalizability and consistency ofresearch results.5 Epistemic advantages, such as the ability to minimize bias, are frequentlyoffered in support of systematic reviews. Systematic reviews are assumed to be minimally biasedbecause the studies they group together are already relatively unbiased: meta-analyses of RCTsare thought to be unbiased because they combine the results of several (already quite unbiased)individual RCTs.6 Practical advantages, such as the ability to assimilate and translate bodies ofevidence into practical guidelines that are ready for use, are also often cited as reasons forpreferring systematic reviews. Chiefly, however, quantitative systematic reviews - or meta-analyses - are favoured because they \"increase the precision of the overall result\" whereprecision refers to \"the measure of the likelihood of random errors (usually depicted as the width 4 I am using the version of the evidence hierarchy outlined in Chapter Three. It is the version created by a number ofthe original proponents of EBM. The arguments in this chapter should apply to most versions of the hierarchyproposed by various international groups, though I do not have the space to properly explore the differences betweeneach of the hierarchies here.5 Greenhalgh, How to Read a Paper, 116.6 Straus and colleagues make the following mysterious claim regarding bias in systematic reviews: \"We'vementioned previously in this chapter the ability of randomized trials to reduce bias. Systematic reviews, bycombining all relevant randomized trials, further reduce both bias and random error and thus provide the highestlevel of evidence currently achievable about the effects of health care. In contrast, systematic reviews of non-randomized trials can compound the problems of individually misleading trials and produce a lower quality ofevidence.\"6 Straus et al., 148-9. It is unclear why the explicit methods of systematic review are thought to pool biasin one case while eliminating it in the other. I discuss issues of bias further in the latter parts of this chapter and inChapter Seven.120of the confidence interval around the result).\"7 In what follows I examine the support for thisclaim. I begin by outlining probabilistic arguments for the precision of meta-analyses. In order todo so I explore the underlying method of hypothesis testing upon which confidence intervals arecalculated. Following this I critique the claim that meta-analyses provide better evidence thanother research methods. I argue that while meta-analyses do provide results with narrowconfidence intervals, there are other meaningful ways of analyzing data that do not make use ofconfidence intervals. It may worthwhile to surrender some degree of precision for greaterattention to the questions that need answering in medical practice. The assumption that precisionis among the highest virtues in medical research, though well-meaning, is ultimately misguided.1.1. ProbabilityExperimentation yields data. More specifically, RCTs and other highly ranked quantitativeresearch methods produce numerical data which require interpretation and analysis. There aremany potentially useful ways of performing this analysis. Of these possible methods (discussedfurther below), probabilistic methods of analysis are unfailingly preferred in medicine. Further,researchers rely on a very specific subset of probabilistic methods: those that rely on afrequentist account of probability. As medical statistician David Salsburg points out, \"It is'standard' to analyze data from a clinical trial using a narrowly defined probabilisticmathematical model.\"8 The very existence of meta-analyses is premised on the assumption thatprobabilistic models and statistical analysis are the best ways of representing the results ofresearch.Probability theory is notoriously controversial. This controversy occurs right down to thefoundational definitions of probability offered by various camps. There are many suchconflicting definitions; I will focus on two of particular interest: frequentism and subjectivism(or Bayesianism). Frequentists propose a relationship of identity between the probability of anevent and its frequency. Under this account probability just is frequency: the number of eventsdivided by the number of possible outcomes. Frequentist probability specifies the number oftimes an event will occur in the long run of nearly identical experiments. Subjective accounts of 7 Greenhalgh, How to Read a Paper, 116, 123.8 Salsburg, \"The Use of Statistical Methods in the Analysis of Clinical Studies,\" 17.121probability suggest that probability just is degrees of belief. Agents assign probabilitiesaccording to their subjective creedal state. Of these two accounts of probability, the frequentistdefinition \"lies at the heart of the standard hypothesis testing formulation. Unless one accepts thefrequentist interpretation, the reasons for treating the standard formulation as an optimalprocedure disappear.\"9 I turn now to an explanation of hypothesis testing in order to establish theconnection between frequentist probability and corresponding types of statistical analysis andhypothesis testing.1.1.1. Hypothesis TestingDespite the variety of possible analytic tools, in the medical context the standard is frequentiststatistical analysis, relying on frequentist accounts of probability. In the reporting of results,medical researchers often focus on discussions about p-values and, more recently, confidenceintervals. This focus comes about as a result of reliance on what is known as \"hypothesistesting\". According to this approach, data are analyzed with respect to a statistical nullhypothesis, which posits that there will be no effect of the treatment. The null hypothesis is auseful fiction, because when employed it creates the appearance of testing hypotheses againsteach other, since the real hypothesis (that the treatment is effective) can be compared to the nullhypothesis (that the treatment has no effect). The worry with hypothesis testing is that we'lleither accept a null hypothesis that is actually false (type two error) or reject a null hypothesisthat is actually true (type one error). Type two errors will eventually get corrected as furtherresearch is performed. Type one errors lead researchers to think that treatments are effectivewhen they are not. This type of error is of particular concern in medicine, where treatmentsproven effective are quickly manufactured and prescribed to patients. Since we cannotcompletely rule out this type of error we are forced to choose a \"level of significance\", whichindicates what the chances are of rejecting a true hypothesis. Significance is how likely a value isto be due to chance, so we want it to be as low as possible. We determine the level ofsignificance on conventional (non-statistical, non-empirical) grounds. This significance level iscalled the p-value and it is generally set at 0.05. What this means is that if you were to do 100tests, you would reject a true hypothesis in 5 of those tests. We have no way of knowing when 9 Ibid., 21.122this has occurred. Significance tests (for example, the t-test, the chi-squared test, and theWilcoxon Rank Sum test) are only possible on data from randomized trials.P-values are a measure of the weight of evidence against the null hypothesis, and if the p-value is small enough (below a set threshold), the null hypothesis is rejected. The limitation ofhypothesis testing that emphasizes p-values is that it provides only yes or no answers. (Istreatment x more effective in this group of subjects than no treatment? Yes/No.) It does notprovide information about magnitude of effect, fluctuations over time, subgroups withinterestingly different responses from the norm, and so on. This is problematic: \"The implicationof hypothesis testing - that there can always be a simple 'yes' or 'no' answer as the fundamentalresult from a medical study - is clearly false and used in this way hypothesis testing is of limitedvalue.\"10 Further, such tests \"often do more damage than good\" because they gloss over thecomplexities of clinical practice in favour of simple answers.11 In response to these concerns,there has been greater attention paid to confidence intervals in recent years.Confidence intervals give an estimated range of values within which the trial result islikely to fall, based on a certain set confidence level (usually 95%). The shift from p-values toconfidence intervals (\"probabilities of probabilities\") is an improvement because confidenceintervals, unlike p-values, allow researchers to include effect size (or magnitude of effect) intheir assessment of research results. Confidence intervals indicate a range of values within whichthe correct result likely lies, and so show us the range of possible effect sizes that are compatiblewith the results of research. Understanding the magnitude of the effect is vital for assessingclinical significance, rather than mere statistical significance. Confidence intervals are thought tocorrect for this false dichotomization of results by indicating a range of values (rather than one p-value) that is more reflective of the generalizability of results to the population. Confidence 10 Quite a lot has been written about the failings of significance levels, or p-values. P-values are said to: fail tocapture what matters about data, fail to represent evidence because they are dependent on only one hypothesis (andevidence requires information about the alternative hypotheses), depend on a fallibilistic theory of scientificinference that is in tension with commitments to positive induction in science more generally, fail to address effectsize (unless supplemented by confidence intervals), obscure the data through requirements that investigators monitortheir hidden actions and intentions during the trial, limit us to thinking that our beliefs can only be weakened by newdata (rather than strengthened), and finally give inconsistent results in cases where the evidence should be the sameand consistent results when the evidence should be different. As a result, journals such as Epidemiology have takena principled stance against their use. In spite of criticism from a variety of perspectives over almost ninety years, p-values continue to feature prominently in almost all of the medical literature produced today. Studies in top journalswill almost always cite p-values, though usually in conjunction with confidence intervals. Gardner and Altman, 746;Goodman and Royall, \"Evidence and Scientific Research\"; Rothman, \"Writing for Epidemiology\"; for ofrecent studies citing p-values see Pierce et al.; Hildesheim et al. in the latest issue of JAMA.11 Salsburg, \"The Religion of Statistics as Practiced in Medical Journals,\" 222.123intervals still depend on the sort of approach characterized here as hypothesis testing, however,and though the results are less rigidly constrained to yes/no declarations, adding ranges of valuesaround the dichotomous yes/no answer is still regarded as somewhat restrictive.1.2. Meta-analyses and EBMMeta-analyses reduce random errors. Recall that a meta-analysis is \"a statistical synthesis of thenumerical results of several trials which all addressed the same question.\"12 Claims that meta-analyses are \"precise\" refer to narrow confidence intervals. The prominent placement of meta-analyses at the top of the hierarchy indicates the importance of narrow confidence intervalswithin EBM since confidence intervals indicate the precision of results. Recall that the hierarchyconsistently places meta-analyses of RCTs above individual RCTS, meta-analyses of cohortstudies above individual cohort studies, and meta-analyses of case-control studies over individualcase-control studies. This indicates the value placed on narrow confidence intervals even whenlower-quality studies are being analyzed. The evidence hierarchy assigns the highest level ofstatus to meta-analyses because meta-analyses make use of statistical tools of analysis thatpermit the creation of large sample sizes and thus the minimization of random error. In the worldof EBM, meta-analyses are king.The official logo of the international Cochrane Collaboration is a pictorial representationof the results of a meta-analysis of seven RCTs. The illustration is a circle with a vertical linedown the middle and a series of seven horizontal lines at different intervals from the top to thebottom of the circle. The vertical line - the \"line of no effect\" - indicates the probability that thetwo treatments being compared (usually treatment and placebo) have the same effect. This is astandard method of representing confidence intervals and the cumulative results of meta-analyses. In this case it culminates in a diamond to the left of the vertical line, near the bottom ofthe circle. The individual RCTs in this meta-analysis investigated a short course ofcorticosteroids to prevent premature labour. What is interesting about the meta-analysis thatforms the Cochrane Collaboration logo is that while only two of the individual RCTs producedconfidence intervals that excluded the possibility that the treatment had no effect, the cumulativedata from all seven trials indicated a clear positive effect of the treatment. (The cumulative result 12 Greenhalgh, How to Read a Paper, 122.124is indicated by the diamond.) According to the meta-analysis, the treatment reduces the odds ofneonatal mortality by 30-50%.13 This result is more confident and more positive than any of theindividual RCTs because when the results of all seven trials are brought together the meta-analysis can draw on this cumulative sample size. The pooled large sample size means thatresearchers performing a meta-analysis can secure narrow confidence intervals for their results.For this reason, meta-analyses of RCTs are highly regarded within the EBM hierarchy. TheCochrane Collaboration logo highlights the strength of meta-analyses in securing precise results.The tendency to prefer analyses that bring together a body of literature is not only evidentin the evidence hierarchy we are currently examining. EBM advocates have argued that evenmeta-analyses are too inaccessible to the busy practitioner: \"What busy practitioner has time touse evidence-based resources if the evidence is presented in its original form or even as detailedsystematic reviews?\"14 Straus and colleagues suggest a \"4S\" approach. Naturally, it ishierarchically organized:SystemsSynopsesSynthesesStudiesAt the lowest level of this hierarchy we have the individual studies (RCTs, cohort studies, case-control studies, and so on - with no mention of the lowest ranked evidence such as case studiesand anecdotal evidence, which appear to have dropped off the bottom). Above that are synthesessuch as meta-analyses of RCTs (of the sort produced by the Cochrane Collaboration). Evenhigher than meta-analyses are synopses. These are the abstracts of meta-analyses found inevidence-based journals. And if the abstract is just too much to handle, Straus and colleagueshelpfully point out that \"in some circumstances, the title [of a review] provides enoughinformation.\"15 Their interest is in conveying the results of research - not the methods or messydetails - as effectively as possible. Finally, at the top of the hierarchy we find computerizeddecision support systems, which would ideally integrate the lower levels of evidence in onelocation. Computer systems are not yet able to do this, but according to Straus and colleaguesthis is would be an ideal approach. 13 Cochrane Collaboration Website: www.cochrane.org14 Straus et al., 37. Emphasis added.15 Ibid.125It may be the case that the abstraction from the data of original research seen in this 4Shierarchy is motivated largely by issues of expediency and practicality. In order to be justified asa good route to knowledge, however, the 4S approach ought to at least protect the production ofknowledge (if not enable it). As mentioned above, the diminished possibility of random error inmeta-analyses is thought to provide this epistemic justification. In what follows I will argue thatthere are reasons to question this focus on precision - particularly when we are sacrificing therelevance of research.1.3. CritiqueStatistician David Salsburg has argued that the narrow focus on hypothesis testing in medicinemisses out on a whole range of other possible methods of analysis available within statistics.Medical statistics, it is argued, \"reflects activity in only a small portion of the statistical world.\"16He calls on medical researchers to \"cast off the awkward cloak of hypothesis testing and treat thedata as an exercise in estimation of parameters and the identification of reasonable subsets ofpatients.\"17 One consequence of this shift, he argues, will be a greater relevance of trials forclinical practice. He cites the overuse of a limited range of statistical concepts as part of thereason for the slow uptake of research in clinical practice.In order to make this point clear, Salsburg presents examples of the sorts of questionsasked by physicians in practice:2. If a patient is going to respond to treatment A, how long will it take for the response tomanifest itself and what can be monitored to know whether such a response has occurred?3. What patient characteristics are there that will identify patients most likely to respond andpatients most likely to suffer adverse reactions? (This assumes, of course, that there are somepatients who will respond, so it might be appropriate to apply a preliminary hypothesis testbefore chasing down will-o'-the-wisps via regression analyses.)4. If an adverse reaction is going to occur, what are its early manifestations, and what is thegeneral pattern of the hazard function (increasing, decreasing, or constant over time)?18 16 Salsburg, \"The Religion of Statistics as Practiced in Medical Journals,\" 220.17 Ibid.18 Ibid.126Standard analysis does not yield answers to these sorts of pressing questions, which Salsburgidentifies as most valuable in practice. Instead analysis yields answers on the efficacy ofparticular treatments relative to the null hypothesis. Salsburg argues, \"It is of little use to societyto have a simple yes or no to the question of whether a new treatment is 'dangerous' or whether anew treatment 'works'.\"19 What is needed, instead, is \"to use these studies to identify subsets ofpatients with specific response patterns and to estimate degrees of effect and the time course ofevents.\"20 These sorts of results would be considerably more relevant to the practical questionsidentified above. And yet these are precisely the opposite of the sorts of meta-analyses deemedbest evidence by the hierarchy of EBM and captured in the 4S approach.Salsburg argues that reliance on a narrow frequentist approach to statistical analysis leadsresearchers to pose irrelevant questions (i.e. those unlike the three just identified).21 The dataproduced by a trial should be analyzed in such a way that it answers the questions physiciansneed answered in order to practice medicine. Yet because of assumptions about the importanceof a certain specific frequentist statistical analysis - to the exclusion of other types of analysis -the data is not usually analyzed to provide these sorts of answers. Salsburg rightly concludes:\"When what is essential to a particular type of mathematical modeling appears inappropriate tothe experimenters who are interested in scientific conclusions, there are serious philosophicalproblems at hand.\"22 Lest he be accused of speaking too theoretically, he proposes a few practicalalternative methods of data analysis. For instance, we can isolate those subjects who respond totreatment and trace their baseline characteristics to see if they have anything in common. If theydo, this might help us identify a subgroup of subjects who are most responsive to the particulartreatment.23 Alternatively, we might measure the way the disease pattern fluctuates over time inthe control group and model this typical pattern. Then we would be able to compare the subjectsin the treatment group against the typical pattern.24 Neither of these methods, nor any other non-probabilistic method of analysis, is currently popular in medicine. The probabilistic model isdominant because we want broad-based application of the results of research, yet as pointed outin Chapter Four, even the probabilistic results produced in meta-analyses cannot be applied 19 Ibid.20 Ibid.21 It also forces researchers to discount a great deal of potentially relevant data. Overlooking data is wasteful andperhaps even unethical. Data gathered on subgroups is lost in most meta-analyses.22 Ibid., 18.23 Ibid.24 Ibid.127broadly to the general population. If we aren't actually gaining the ability to apply the resultsbroadly, why is there a continued emphasis on these sorts of results?Consider the following case. A new treatment is tested in an RCT. Analysis of the resultsindicates a p-value of 0.049. Researchers conclude that the treatment is effective for the pre-specified outcome. The confidence interval is narrow because the sample size was large, so theresults are thought to have been well-established, and physicians are advised to prescribe thetreatment to the general population. Closer attention to the results, however, yields interestingfurther data. For instance, while the treatment group did better overall, within the group half themembers did slightly worse, while the other half did quite a lot better. On average this meant thatthe group did somewhat better (enough to be statistically significant). Surely it is important tounderstand the subgroup differences in this trial. Imagine, for instance, those in the treatmentgroup who responded very well were men and the others who did not were women. This data cantoo quickly be ignored, and even lost in meta-analyses that analyze results of multiple trials interms of average p-values and confidence intervals. Physicians prescribing the treatment,however, would be better served by closer attention to these differences. In this example, therelevant subgroup data will be analyzed probabilistically so this re-analysis still relies onprobabilistic analysis - though applied to different data. A more innovative re-analysis wouldconsider non-probabilistic methods of interpreting the results as well. This is precisely whatmedical statisticians such as Salsburg are arguing. There are better ways of getting answers toimportant clinical questions than to unreflectively analyze data from RCTs searching for the\"rare mice\" of low p-values or narrow confidence intervals.1.4. Statistical Style of ReasoningThe choice of probabilistic model underling EBM is undefended and I would suggest that thechoice has more to do with trendiness and educational inertia than the provision of soundarguments. It is worth briefly attending to the ways in which popular use of a theory or methodcan shape the development of an entire field. Ian Hacking has suggested that there are a varietyof styles of reasoning, including (but not limited to): simple mathematical postulation,experimental exploration and measurement, analogy, comparison and taxonomy, historical128derivation and statistical analysis.25 Styles of reasoning, according to Hacking, are created inorder to meet the changing needs, interests and goals of various communities and are often, as heputs it, \"defended by bluster and insidious patience.\"26 As a style of reasoning evolves within aparticular community it gradually becomes fixed as an objective route to knowledge. That is, it isassumed without question that the reasoning style is a route to knowledge:[I]t needs no support or rhetoric, for as it assumes self-confidence it generates its ownstandard of objectivity and its own ideology. It starts by being pushed and shaped bysocial vectors of every sort; we end with a self-sustaining mode of knowledge. Itbecomes less something molded by interests and more an unquestioned resource uponwhich any interest must draw, if it ever hopes for the accolade of objectivity. And itfurther determines how people conceive of themselves and their world, opening newhorizons, but also constraining the possible forms of knowledge.27Hacking goes on to argue that statistical reasoning is self-authenticating in precisely the way justoutlined. We believe that the results of statistical calculation are, on the whole, accurate. But ourmeasure of accuracy in this case is, of necessity, also determined using statistical principles. Wehave no true number independent of any statistical method against which we could measure, touse a famous example, the population of New York. We determine the reliability of the statisticalstyle of reasoning using further statistics (in the medical context confidence intervals performthis function). Hacking argues that, though it appears circular, it is the same apparent circularityfound in all styles of reasoning and would be better described as boot-strapping. The case ofstatistical reasoning just makes this boot-strapping obvious, since it is so transparent.28 One of thelessons I draw from Hacking's analysis, which overlaps with the concerns raised by Salsburg, isthat we need to be aware of this process of self-authentication. We ought to be aware of the waysin which the process tends to exclude alternative approaches, even when, from the outside, wecan see that those alternatives might be valuable. This analysis points out an importantimplication of this understanding of the self-authentication of styles of reasoning: the constraintof possible forms of knowledge to those that fit the accepted style. If, in medicine, meta-analysesare highly regarded - to the point that physicians are actually counseled to look only at meta- 25 Hacking, \"Statistical Language, Statistical Truth and Statistical Reason,\" 132. This particular list was originallyproposed by Crombie in 1978.26 Ibid.27 Ibid.28 Ibid., 144.129analyses and not bother with original research - and if this assumption rests on a characterizationof styles of reasoning that is unnecessarily narrow, we have reason to call this assumption intoquestion.1.5. Conclusions on PrecisionSalsburg instructively writes, \"many branches of scientific research flourish without probabilisticmodeling or with, at most, a minimal use of averages and standard deviations. These includemolecular biology, mathematical biology, physiology and physical chemistry.\"29 To the extentthis is the case it is because other formal techniques have been developed that take their place.Why then the assumption that best evidence in medicine has a small p-value and narrowconfidence interval? While it may turn out to be the case that (frequentist) probabilistic methodsof analysis are very useful in medicine, this does not mean that other methods of analysis are tobe ignored. There are other methods of statistical analysis that draw on Bayesian accounts ofprobability. More to the point, though, there are entirely non-probabilistic methods of analysisavailable. Hacking identifies several other 'styles of reasoning' and Salsburg points out the typesof questions and corresponding methods of analysis that are obscured by the attention to a certainnarrow range of probabilistic methods in medicine. Attention to the value of other methods ofanalysis may yield answers to more pressing clinical questions than those traditionally answeredin meta-analyses of RCTs.2. RandomizationOne of the principal divisions in the evidence hierarchy is that between randomized and non-randomized trials. 30 If a trial is randomized, it is ranked near the top of the hierarchy. If not, it is 29 Salsburg, \"The Use of Statistical Methods in the Analysis of Clinical Studies,\" 18.30 Discussions of randomization in clinical research refer to the random allocation of subjects to some number oftreatment and control groups (usually one of each). They do not refer to the selection of a random sample of thegeneral population for the study (in fact, clinical trials are often notoriously unrepresentative of the generalpopulation because of inclusion and exclusion criteria). Random sampling is arguably related to our ability togeneralize from the results obtained on the particular subjects under investigation to the population as a whole, whilerandom allocation is thought to balance treatment and control groups and isolate a cause and effect relationshipbetween treatment and outcome. The following discussion addresses random allocation. Random allocation isachieved by tossing a die, flipping a coin, drawing a card from a deck, or through more complicated measures such130below. So what epistemic benefits are attached to randomization? The value placed onrandomization is most evident in the sharp line drawn between the RCT and the lower-rankedcohort study. Given that cohort studies are also controlled trials (they have treatment and controlgroups), can be double-blinded (though this depends on the type of intervention, as it does forRCTs), can be analyzed under the intention-to-treat protocol, and have an identical causalinferential structure (eliminative induction), the only feature distinctive of RCTs is the randomallocation of participants to the two groups. In what follows I will consider four possiblearguments for randomization, and outline various critiques that have been raised against thesearguments. I argue that randomization does not secure the epistemic benefits it is thought tosecure. In conjunction with the other arguments made in this chapter, I argue that the RCTshould not have a position of privilege in the evidence hierarchy. First, I will establish the EBMposition on randomization.2.1. Randomized Trials and EBMRandomized trials are consistently placed at the top of various versions of the evidencehierarchy. The following quotes are representative of the attitude toward randomization byproponents of EBM:[W]e owe it to our patients to minimize our application of useless and harmful therapy bybasing our treatments, wherever possible, on the results of proper randomized controlledtrials.31To ensure that, at least on your first pass, you identify only the highest quality studies,you include the methodological term 'randomized controlled trial forpublication type).32If the study wasn't randomized, we'd suggest that you stop reading it and go on to thenext article in your search. (Note: We can begin to rapidly critically appraise articles byscanning the abstract to determine if the study is randomized; if it isn't, we can bin it.)Only if you can't find any randomized trials should you go back to it.33 as random number tables. There are problems with all attempts to create \"random\" numbers, but I will not get intothose here.31 Sackett et al., Clinical Epidemiology, 195.32 Guyatt, Sackett, and Cook, \"How to Use an Article Therapy or Prevention,\" 59.33 Straus et al., Evidence-based Medicine: How to Practice and Teach EBM, 118.131The first two statements were made by prominent members of the EBM working group, and thechatty advice proffered in the third appears in the 2005 edition of the official EBM handbook.Claims that EBM does not privilege RCTs and that advocates do not tell physicians to ignoreother sources of evidence are contradicted by these recent statements. In addition, carefulexamination of the guidelines used in the evaluation of research evidence indicates a persistenttendency to set aside all studies that are not RCTs, despite claims to the contrary.342.2. Non-randomized Trials Exaggerate Treatment EffectsA number of arguments are made in favour of randomization. The argument that non-randomized trials overestimate treatment effects is pervasive in the medical literature. Sackettand colleagues write, \"It is when asking questions about therapy that we should try to avoid thenon-experimental approaches, since these routinely lead to false positive conclusions aboutefficacy.\"35 It does not take anything more than elementary logic to point out the circularity inthis argument. In order to establish that RCTs are more accurate than other methods the authorsstart by assuming that RCTs are more accurate than other methods, show how the results of non-randomized trials differ from the results obtained through RCTs and conclude that RCTs arebetter. Data indicating a persistent difference of this sort (were it to exist), however, would beconsistent with the claim that that non-randomized trials are producing more accurate accountsof events and that randomized trials systematically underestimate treatment effects. The fact thatthere is some apparent difference does not immediately lend itself to interpretation one way orthe other. These sorts of arguments beg the question.Furthermore, when offering empirical evidence for the claim that non-randomized trialsproduce different results on average from randomized trials - a claim that can be made withoutcircularity - Sackett and colleagues provide very little empirical evidence. Recent investigationshave indicated that there is no significant difference between the results of well-conducted RCTs,cohort studies and case-control studies. John Concato, Nirav Shah and Ralph Horwitz examinedthe results of different trial designs investigating the same clinical interventions and found that, 34 Grossman and Mackenzie exposed this problem using the example of the MERGE guidelines in their 2005 paper.35 Sackett et al., \"Evidence-based Medicine: What it is and what it isn't,\" 313. Emphasis added.132[F]or the five clinical topics and 99 reports evaluated, the average results of theobservational studies were remarkably similar to those of the randomized, controlledtrials...The results of well-designed observational studies (with either a cohort or a case-control design) do not systematically overestimate the magnitude of the effects oftreatment as compared with those in randomized, controlled trials on the same topic.36In fact, they discovered that there was less variability in the results of non-randomized trials onthe same intervention than within the set of randomized trials. It is not the case that non-randomized trials exaggerate treatment effects.2.3. Non-randomized Trials Are MisleadingThis claim is sometimes formulated as part of the last argument, though it has a broader scope,Because the randomized trial, and especially the systematic review of several randomizedtrials, is so much more likely to inform us and so much less likely to mislead us, it hasbecome the 'gold standard' for judging whether a treatment does more good than harm.37What quite often happens is that advocates of EBM provide a few examples of non-randomizedtrials or pathophysiological reasoning that we now know to have been flawed.38 With the benefitsof hindsight we now know that interferon for cancer, hydrocortisone for acute myocardialinfarction, and freezing of the stomach for duodenal ulcers are not effective treatments. Once afew of these examples have been listed, proponents make statements like the following: \"Theliterature is replete with examples where a new treatment was highly touted by its proponentsand enjoyed a good deal of popularity for a time, but did not withstand the test of a well-controlled randomized clinical trial.\"39 As Ross Upshur puts it, however, \"that a hypothesis turnsout to be wrong is nothing new nor [anything] to be particularly ashamed about. It is how scienceworks.\"40 Moreover, there are many recent examples of treatments that were approved in RCTs 36 Concato, Shah and Horwitz, \"Randomized, Controlled Trials, Observational Studies, and the Hierarchy ofResearch Designs,\" 1887. See also Benson and Hartz, \"A Comparison Studies and RandomizedControlled Trials.\"37 Sackett et al., \"Evidence-based Medicine: What it is and what it isn't,\" 313. Emphasis added.38 We saw some of these arguments against pathophysiology in the Chapter Four.39 Grage and Zelen, \"The Controlled Randomized Trial in the Evaluation of Cancer Treatment - the Dilemma andAlternative Designs,\" 37. In addition, EBM advocates often compare poorly conducted non-randomized trials towell conducted RCTs in order to make the benefits of RCTs more apparent.40 Upshur, \"Thin Warrant.\"133and which we later found to be harmful through long-term observational studies. Cox-2inhibitors (for instance, Vioxx\u00ae) and spironolactone are two examples of treatments thatproduced positive initial results for specific conditions in RCTs but which we have since realizedare harmful to some patients. In the case of Vioxx\u00ae millions of patients were affected by themedical community's failure, among other things, to believe the results of observational studieswhich indicated increased risks associated with its use.41 Were we to follow the reasoning ofEBM proponents, we might be tempted to suggest that randomized trials routinely mislead us.What we should be reminded of instead is the uncertainty and fallibility of all medical research,regardless of the choice of research method. As the trial by Concato and colleaguesdemonstrated, on average the results of well-designed randomized non-randomized trialswere the same.422.4. Non-randomized Trials Cannot Balance GroupsIt is often asserted that only randomization can balance unknown confounding factors intreatment and control groups. Confounding factors are variables that affect the dependentvariable under investigation in a trial.43 In order to understand this claim, consider first theimportance of control groups. If we want to know whether a new flu vaccine is effective we willnot get much information by giving it to one group of people and recording the results.44 This isbecause without a comparison group we have no sense of whether, for instance, a 10% rate of theflu in the vaccine recipients is more or less than what it would have been otherwise. In order toknow whether the flu vaccine is effective we need to compare rates of subsequent infection inpeople who did and did not receive the shot. Hence the need for a control group. And not justany control group will do. It would obviously be problematic if we assigned elderly people to the 41 Upshur, \"Looking for Rules in a World of Exceptions.\"42 Concato, Shah, and Horwitz.43 To use a popular example, if murder rates are highly correlated to ice-cream consumption in a particularpopulation, this does not necessarily mean that ice-cream consumption causes murders, or that murders drive peopleto consume ice-cream (though this could turn out to be the case). Rather, correlation of these factors may indicatethat the two are both caused by another variable - say, hot weather. If we design a study to investigate therelationship between ice-cream consumption and murder, and fail to control for the state of the weather, we mightend up making inappropriate claims about the causal relationship between murder and ice-cream consumption. Inthis example, weather conditions are a confounding factor.44 In spite of this well-known fact, flu vaccines in Ontario have been offered free to everyone without any systematicattempt to track and compare results across populations. Ross Upshur, personal communication.134control group and young people to the treatment group (or vice versa) since we have reason tothink that factors such as age influence the odds of contracting the flu. Treatment and controlgroups that are imbalanced with respect to these sorts of 'known' (suspected) confounders makeit difficult for researchers to isolate the cause and effect under investigation. It leaves open thepossibility that the confounding factor, not the treatment, is producing a particular effect.We can control for known confounding factors by deliberate matching. For instance, wecan make sure that there is an equal distribution of elderly and young people in our two groups.However, it is impossible to know that we have matched for all confounding factors becausethere are an infinite number of possible confounders - many of which, no doubt, we will nothave any reason to suspect. It may turn out to be the case that blonde-haired people get the flumore often than other members of the general public. If the treatment and control groups areimbalanced with respect to blonde-haired subjects we have the same problem we started with. Aslong as we only make use of deliberate matching, it will always be possible for the groups to beimbalanced on an unknown confounding factor. If so, the success or failure of the treatment maybe a result of this imbalance and not due to the properties of the treatment under investigation.Advocates of randomization are quick to step in at this point; after all, it is onlyrandomization of study participants that can control for all known and unknown confoundingfactors. This claim goes back to Fisher, who writes that the significance test can be \"guaranteedagainst corruption\" by the use of randomization.45 As Worrall points out, this is far too strong aclaim, and Fisher and other statisticians who have made similar claims must have been aware ofthis. The two groups can, at best, be balanced for all factors only \"in some probabilistic sense.\"46The defensible weaker position tempers its claims with statements like \"as balanced as possible\"and refers to the \"tendency\" for balance rather than any guarantee.47 More specifically, Worrallargues, randomizers are arguing that it is improbable that the two groups are imbalanced withrespect to any one particular unknown confounder. However,Even if there is only a small probability that an individual factor is unbalanced, given thatthere are indefinitely many possible confounding factors, then it would seem to follow 45 Fisher, The Design of Experiments, 19.46 Worrall, \"What Evidence in Evidence-based Medicine?\" S322.47 Ibid.135that the probability that there is some factor on which the two groups areunbalanced...might for all anyone knows be high.48In order to begin to address this problem (though it can never be fully overcome), therandomization would have to be repeated an indefinite number of times. In RCTs, randomizationis done once. Given that I am studying the standards of evidence used in the medical context, Iam interested in claims made about RCTs as they are used in research, not in claims made abouthypothetical RCTs in ideal worlds. As a result, then, randomization does not create theconditions for justified reasoning by eliminative induction: \"The premise that the experimentalgroups were probably balanced does not imply that the differences that arise in the clinical trialwere probably due to the experimental treatment.\"49 If the two groups are only probably balanced(and it is clear that this is the best we can hope for), it is no longer possible to claim that we arereasoning by eliminative induction, because we have not eliminated the possible options, butonly made them less likely. In an RCT, there are two options: the causal hypothesis which claimsthat the treatment has an effect (whether positive or negative), and the null hypothesis whichclaims that there is no effect. Once the null hypothesis has been rejected, that is, once there issome significant result, the researcher knows that some causal factor is at work. In order to beable to claim that the treatment under investigation is that causal factor, all alternatives have tohave been eliminated. As it turns out, though, the alternatives are never eliminated.50To sum up, the standard position is that non-randomized trials may be unbalanced withrespect to unknown confounding factors and so produce skewed results. Only randomized trialsare said to ensure that unknown confounding factors are distributed randomly among the twogroups. But it turns out that the groups likely are not balanced, and in fact the odds are very goodthat, given an indefinite number of possible confounders, any given RCT will be imbalanced onat least one factor.51 Running the trial over again (and again) would help with this problem, but isimpractical. Meta-analyses might be thought to save the day here, but in fact they pool data fromsimilar trials asking similar questions - not replicated trials. Randomization does not balance 48 Ibid., S324. Worrall draws on work by Dennis Lindley here.49 Howson and Urbach, Scientific Reasoning, 197. Emphasis added.50 This will not come as a surprise to anyone familiar with the problem of induction. In fact, the common claimsabout the ability of RCTs to secure causes betray a lack of appreciation for the problem of induction. Whileparalysis in light of the problem is unhelpful, so is pretending that you have secured facts when you have not.51 Worrall, \"What evidence in evidence-based medicine?\" S324.136treatment and control groups with respect to all possible confounding factors.52 This does notmean that randomization is entirely ineffective - it still makes it less likely that confoundingfactors are at play. This has some epistemic value. But this value is much more limited thangenerally recognized, and does not provide a basis for ranking randomized methods categoricallyabove carefully matched or historically-controlled trials.2.4.1. Aside: Table 1This brings us to one of the odd features of RCTs as they appear in medical journals today.53RCTs are consistently published with a Table 1, which is meant to indicate whetherrandomization has been successful or not. In the table, researchers select possible knownconfounding variables and see whether they were, in fact, evenly distributed into the two groupsas a result of randomization. While groups that are balanced on suspected factors may beunbalanced on other factors, \"we are reassured when the known prognostic factors are wellbalanced.\"54 This betrays a significant misunderstanding of randomization. The mistake iscaptured perfectly in a Dilbert cartoon:Accounting Troll 1: Over here we have our random number generator.Troll 2: Nine nine nine nine nine nine.Dilbert: Are you sure that's random?Troll 1: That's the problem with randomness: you never can be sure.55A sequence of nines may be just as random as something that appears stereotypically random(i.e. has no discernable pattern). You cannot assess whether randomization has been successfulor not. Table 1 also betrays a lack of faith in the powers of randomization. After all, if it works, itworks. Since you cannot go back and make sure it worked with respect to the unknownconfounders, what is the point of checking on known variables (rather than matching for them inthe first place)? It is a pointless exercise. If this is driven by (justified) lingering concerns about 52 It is important to note that there are statistical techniques beyond matching which can adjust for confoundingfactors in non-randomized trials; stratification, multivariable adjustment, propensity scores, and instrumentalvariables are some of the most common. So randomization isn't necessarily the best we can do, either.53 Thanks to Ross Upshur for bringing this problem to my attention.54 Guyat and Rennie, Users' Guide to the Medical Literature, 62.55 Adams.137randomization in general, then there is a need for explicit recognition of this and a bettersolution.2.5. Non-randomized Trials Identify Correlations (Not Causes)Only randomized trials are thought to be capable of establishing genuinely causal relationshipsbetween treatments and effects; studies lower on the hierarchy get at \"mere correlation\".Causation is a complex concept; as such, it is important to be clear on what is meant by a causein this context. Two types of causes are common in medicine: mechanistic causes andprobabilistic causes.56 Mechanistic causes are provided by bench research in biochemistry,genetics, physiology and other basic sciences and are thought to be especially stable becausethey hold in all cases (not just selected sub-populations, however carefully or randomlyselected). Probabilistic causes establish strength of association between dependent andindependent variables in a given population, ideally in repeated studies.57In Chapter Four I outlined the EBM position on pathophysiologic mechanisms and benchscience. While mechanistic and probabilistic causes might intuitively be thought of ascomplementary ways of understanding the empirical world, the evidence hierarchy identifiesprobabilistic causes as epistemically superior. Claims about the special causal abilities of RCTsrefer to probabilistic causes and ignore the possibility that mechanistic causes could be just aswell-established, just as epistemically strong, and just as useful in medical practice. ConsiderBradford-Hill's nine criteria for causation: strength of association, temporality, consistency,theoretical plausibility, coherence, specificity, dose-response relationship, experimentalevidence, analogy.58 criteria, several explicitly relate to mechanisms: temporality,theoretical plausibility, coherence and experimental evidence all rely on a characterization of acause as a mechanism of some sort.59 Many of the remaining criteria relate to probabilisticcauses. It is unclear why some of these criteria (those that are probabilistic) have been elevated 56 Russo and Williamson. There is considerable debate over the ontological status and unity/disunity of the conceptof causation. Russo and Williamson, for instance, argue that while there are two distinct types of evidence inmedicine there is only one unified account of causation. A comprehensive catalogue of causes is offered inParascandola and Weed. There may also be other types of causes relevant to the health context. I do not offer acomprehensive overview of causation in this dissertation as it is beyond the scope of this project.57 Russo and Williamson.58 Hill.59 Russo and Williamson.138within EBM while others (those that are mechanistic) have not. In addition to the neglect of othertypes of causes, the assumption that RCTs uniquely isolate probabilistic causes runs into its ownproblems.Claims about the causal powers of RCTs begin with the assumption that randomizationcontrols for all known and unknown confounding factors. We have already seen why this isproblematic: because there are indefinitely many possible confounding factors it is probable that,in any particular trial, the two groups are, in fact, unbalanced. Following this, defenders of thespecial causal ability of RCTs make claims about the epistemic powers of actual RCTs based onwhat would happen in ideal RCTs. The presence of the phrase \"in the long run\" betrays the slideto theoretical claims that have no particular bearing on RCTs as they are done in the medicalcontext.60 If we were to randomize forever, the limiting-average effect of the treatment wouldyield information of the sort desired by RCT enthusiasts. However, RCTs are only ever doneonce. Even on the infrequent occasion when an RCT is repeated it is done on different subjects,in a different context. It is not, strictly speaking, replicated. Unfortunately, \"there is no reason tothink that any actual randomized trial gives the same results as would be got from the 'limiting-average'.\"61 Because of the number of variables at play it is more likely that, were the trial to berun many times, each set of results would be slightly different. So while we might be justified inmaking claims about the causal powers of randomization in the long run, in the short run (whichis all we have) those powers are nonexistent. It is not just that it is logically possible for RCTs tofail to establish causation (we already knew that based on the number of conflicting RCTs, afterall). It is that we never know how close they have come to doing so. This is not significantlydifferent from the sorts of claims that can be made about the results of, for instance, well-conducted historical trials. There is no special access to causes granted only to RCTs.Claims that RCTs isolate causes, while other methods identify merely correlations, haveundefined and undefended accounts of causation that unfairly denigrate mechanistic causes,depend on arguments about the ability of randomization to balance groups on known andunknown factors (which we've already identified as problematic), and rely on characterizationsof ideal RCTs (such as the indefinite repetition of the trial) that are never attainable in practice.All research methods that make use of probabilistic methods of analysis have some ability to get 60 \"[R]andomization will ensure that all other causes of R are probabilistically independent of T in the long run.\"Papineau, D. \"The Virtues of Randomization,\" 446-7. Cause to Randomize,\" 465.139at probabilistic causes and it may be the case that, in cases where an RCT is the best method fora particular question, it is especially good at narrowing down the possible causes, but this doesnot mean that RCTs have a unique capacity to identify causal relationships.2.5.1. Aside: Side-effectsExtensive confusion about causation in the medical literature is reflected in claims about the realeffects and side-effects (or adverse effects) of treatments. Clinical trials claim to demonstrate thata treatment works by causing a particular (desirable) outcome. When this has been provisionallyestablished, they tack on a list of possible side-effects that are only stripped of a more honorifictitle of primary effect in virtue of not having been selected as the endpoint of interest when thetrial was designed.62 As a result, researchers publish results purporting to demonstrate theefficacy of a particular treatment, even though the rate of certain side-effects is as high (orhigher!) than the desired outcome.63 If a treatment has multiple effects, there is somethingdeceptive in labeling one of them the primary effect and others side-effects. This is not just atheoretical problem. Treatments are being prescribed for one condition and causing a handful ofothers. This is compounded when doctors prescribe further treatments to address the symptomsand side-effects of the first treatment. The rate of deaths caused by adverse drug reactions isalarming, even with the most conservative estimates and the most robust contextualization,including recognition that we have no other treatments for many diseases.64 Confusion aboutcausation contributes to this problem. RCTs are designed to investigate single cause-effect 62 When trials are designed, the standard view has it that we can only draw reliable conclusions about outcomes wedetermine in advance. This prevents data dredging.63 For example, in a 2005 article on low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in womenover 45 (published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine) the authors emphasize the statisticallysignificant benefits of aspirin in the prevention of strokes. A closer examination of the original data indicates thatthere were approximately four times more adverse events (gastrointestinal bleeds of any sort) than beneficial eventswith respect to strokes. And yet the analysis selects only a small subset of the gastrointestinal bleeds (those resultingin blood transfusion) as their adverse event rate. Even with this smaller number, the benefits and risks come abouteven - certainly there is no clear benefit. In spite of all of this, the emphasis in the conclusion of the article is on thepotential benefits of low-dose aspirin in the prevention of strokes, though the authors do acknowledge theimportance of individualizing decisions for particular patients. Ridker et al.64 The most widely cited figure on deaths due to adverse drug reactions is a conservative estimate of 100,000 peryear in the United States. Including hospitalizations and injuries without death pushes this number over 2 million.This would translate to about 10,000 death per year in Canada, or 200,000 events overall, assuming the twocountries are roughly comparable on this issue. Many scholars regard this as a very low estimate and suggest that thenumber is more likely several times larger. Lazarou, Pomeranz, and Corey, \"Incidence of adverse drug reactions inhospitalized patients.\"140relationships between treatments and desired outcomes. Some people read the results of suchstudies without contextualizing them and assume that all that happens is that a specific treatmentcauses a desired effect. The causal story is much more complicated. Of course, conscientiousphysicians are aware of this, but it is interesting how the way the research is presented tends toplay into such fantasies about single causes and effects.2.6. Conclusions on RandomizationA number of claims have been made about the epistemic benefits of randomization. In theevidence hierarchy for medical treatments, randomized trials are consistently ranked above non-randomized trials. It should not be inferred, on the basis of the critique of RCTs just outlined,that RCTs are bad trial designs or should not be pursued. What I and others argue is that RCTsare not necessarily better than other methods. Insofar as the evidence hierarchy elevatesrandomized methods above all other methods categorically, the hierarchy is flawed. This will notmean the end of RCTs, but rather the end of the claim that they are superior to all other methodsmerely in virtue of the fact that they are randomized. It will allow for the results of well-conducted cohort or case-control studies (and the results of qualitative studies and case studies)to outweigh the findings of RCTs in particular cases. As Howson and Urbach put it, \"removingthe absolute requirement for randomization is a significant step which lifts some severe and, inour view, undesirable limitations on acceptable trials.\"65 Sometimes non-randomized trials arebetter than randomized trials. Randomization does not confer the advantages it is often claimedto confer upon evidence. Thus, randomization does not justify placing one trial above another inthe evidence hierarchy.3. Managing BiasOne of the justifications of the evidence hierarchy is that it ranks research methodologiesaccording to their ability to eliminate bias. In what follows I will investigate whether evidenceranked highest in the hierarchy is, by design, less biased than that below. I argue that it is not. Instatistical terminology bias is, \"a systematic distortion of an expected statistical result due to a 65 Howson and Urbach, Scientific Reasoning, 202.141factor not allowed for in its derivation; also, a tendency to produce such distortion.\"66 The narrowconcern of statistical methodology is with confounding factors as possible sources of bias. I havealready discussed confounders in the section on randomization above. In this section I willconsider bias in a broader sense. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, bias is: \"aninclination, leaning, tendency, bent; a preponderating disposition or propensity; predispositiontowards; predilection; prejudice.\" 67 This broader definition includes what I have been referringto as social or contextual values in previous chapters. I will begin with a description of the claimsabout bias made by proponents of EBM.3.1. Bias and EBMThe evidence hierarchy rests on the notion \"that it is possible to rank methods of inquiry by theirsusceptibility to bias.\"68 The EBM working group writes about the systematic attempts to recordobservations in an \"unbiased\" fashion as one of the key features distinguishing clinical researchfrom clinical practice.69 According to the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, theevidence hierarchy is designed to \"place greatest weight on the features of study design andanalysis that tend to eliminate or minimize biased results.\"70 Of all of the available methods, theRCT is thought to be least subject to bias. I turn now to a description of the range of biases thatimpact clinical research.3.2. Catalogues of BiasIn 1979, David Sackett wrote an article entitled \"Bias in Analytic Research\", in which he offereda preliminary catalogue of the sources of bias that distort medical research.71 The paper waswritten in response to the growth of case-control studies in the medical literature at the time. Oneof Sackett's aims was to encourage further methodological developments in order to improve thedesign of case-control studies. Another of his aims was to demonstrate that cohort studies are 66 Oxford English Dictionary Online.67 Ibid.68 Ashcroft, \"Current Epistemological Problems in Evidence Based Medicine,\" 131.69 Evidence Based Medicine Working Group, 2421.70 Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.71 Sackett, \"Bias in Analytic Research.\"142preferable to case-control studies, when possible, because their methodology allows for greaterprevention and control of bias. This was based on an understanding of the profound (negative)impact biases could have on the results of a trial.72 The original catalogue lists 56 biases that ariseover seven stages of research.73 Sackett provided detailed empirical evidence of a sample of 9biases that occur during the course of the trial, along with suggestions for preventing andminimizing these forms of bias. Sackett acknowledged that many of the other sources of bias aredifficult to address. In fact, he only offered mechanisms for dealing only with 9 of the 35 biasesof sampling and measurement (and these represent only two of the seven stages of research), andeven those with only partial success.A recent second edition of a well-known users guide to Randomized Controlled Trialsprovides a more contemporary catalogue of the types of biases that can influence medicalresearch. The authors acknowledge that there are potentially infinite sources of bias, and outlineover 60 of the most common types, at five stages of research:1) Prior to the trial (e.g. choice of question bias)2) During the trial (e.g. outcome choice bias)3) Reporting the trial (e.g. selective reporting bias)4) Disseminating the trial (e.g. publication bias)5) Uptake of the trial (e.g. reader bias) 74It is worth keeping in mind that Sackett's original catalogue dealt with biases affecting case-control studies (and, for comparison, cohort studies). One might expect that there would be fewerbiases influencing RCTs, since they are thought to be an improvement over the cohort design.But that would underestimate the creativity of the human mind, both in coming up with newresearch loopholes and in identifying and cataloguing them after the fact.3.3. Bias in RCTs 72 Sackett highlights the problem of bias in an attempt to encourage the improvement of the methodologicalstandards of case-control studies. In a prescient statement, he writes \"The failure to respond here may lead to thepublication of a rash of ill-conceived, seriously flawed case-control studies and a subsequent rejection of the entireapproach by an inflamed scientific community.\" It is ironic that Sackett proudly led this 'inflamed' communitylargely to reject case-control studies a decade later (they ended up quite low on the evidence hierarchy).73 The seven stages of research in which bias can occur (as identified by Sackett) are: \"(1) In reading-up on the field,(2) In specifying and selecting the study sample, (3) In executing the experimental manoeuver (or exposure), (4) Inmeasuring exposures and outcomes, (5) In analyzing the data, (6) In interpreting the analysis, and (7) In publishingthe results [and back Trials.143As earlier, the (causal) inferential structure of the RCT is almost identical to thecohort study, though the cohort study is consistently ranked below the RCT in various versionsof the EBM hierarchy. The superiority of RCTs is often illustrated with reference to two forms ofbias: selection bias and ascertainment bias. The RCT is said to be the only method that cancontrol for these forms of bias. This is thought to partly justify the higher status of RCTs in theevidence hierarchy. In what follows I will take a close look at the biases that RCTs alone arethought to be able to address.The authoritative CONSORT statement defines selection bias as: \"systematic error increating intervention groups, such that they differ with respect to prognosis. That is, the groupsdiffer in measured or unmeasured baseline characteristics because of the way participants wereselected or assigned.\"75 Jadad and Enkin suggest that this is the one bias RCTs can truly claim tocontrol better than other trial designs. Even philosophers who are otherwise very critical of RCTsare willing to concede that they have some special epistemic powers with respect to selectionbias.76 This form of bias can occur when selecting subjects for the trial from the general public.In the early days of clinical research, before randomization was popularized, medicalresearchers attempted to achieve balanced treatment and control groups by alternating theallocation of patients to the two groups as they were enrolled into the trial. The problem with thiswas that physicians modified their behavior depending on whether the next patient was to beenrolled into one group or the other. Physicians would, on occasion, refrain from invitingpatients into a trial when they knew the next participant would receive placebo or purposelyenroll patients who were more or less likely to do well on the treatment into one or the othergroup depending on what they hoped to establish with the results of the trial. In order to dealwith selection bias of this sort, it is important (at least, in these types of trials) that researchersinstitute some form of allocation concealment. By concealing the allocation of enrolled patientsfrom the physicians doing the intake for the trial, this form of bias can be minimized - at leastinsofar as it differentially affects the groups (physicians may still reject subjects for fear they willimbalance the overall results, or even design the trial so that it explicitly excludes people 75 CONSORT Statement.76 Urbach; Worrall \"Why There's No Cause to Randomize.\"144unlikely to benefit from the treatment in order to make it more likely that the results are positiveoverall).Allocation concealment is secured independently of randomization. In fact, a trial can berandomized and yet fail to have allocation concealment (this was of great concern to theproponents of EBM, who pushed for explicit statements about allocation concealment inpublished studies). If the physician conducting the trial is aware of the randomization sequence,then there is no allocation concealment. And a non-randomized cohort study can have concealedallocation (it is just a matter of keeping the allocation criteria - whatever they may be - from thephysicians doing the intake). Perhaps more to the point, other research designs such as casestudies and qualitative research (in-depth interviews, for instance) do not encounter this bias.77When allocation concealment is achieved, it is not because the allocation was randomized, butrather because it was successfully concealed. RCTs are not unique in controlling for selectionbias.How about ascertainment bias, then? It is defined as the \"systematic distortion of theresults of a randomized trial as a result of knowledge of the group assignment by the personassessing [the] outcome, whether an investigator or the participant themselves.\"78 It is hard toimagine why this would be uniquely achieved in RCTs. Ascertainment bias arises in the patientreports and analyses of the trial as it nears completion. If either the patient or physician is awareof the group the patient ended up in, this may lead them to report more positive, or morenegative, results. For instance, a patient may overstate his or her improvement in order to gainpraise from the physician, or the physician may ask fewer questions or adopt a more detachedattitude in order to get more subdued reports from patients in the placebo group. As with allbiases, these may be conscious or unconscious. The mechanism for addressing such bias isblinding. It is important to ensure that the participants, physicians, and even analysts are blind tothe allocation of treatment and control groups. Double and triple-blinding are mechanisms fordiminishing the effect of ascertainment bias. And blinding is not unique to RCTs, nor evenalways possible in RCTs. RCTs on lifestyle and surgical interventions, for instance, are often not 77 They may encounter a similar bias, but because they do not have control groups, or even groups at all in somecases, the bias is not exactly the same. Qualitative researchers also have a number of ways of dealing with theselection of patients to studies. Furthermore, none of the strategies for dealing with selection bias in quantitativeresearch are perfect, and this includes allocation concealment. Researchers have been known to break into lockeddesks, hold envelopes up to the light and steam open envelopes in order to get at allocation patterns.78 CONSORT Statement.145blinded. Even if we were to imagine that blinding is unique to RCTs, this would not necessarilyindicate that RCTs are more objective, since other research methodologies, such as historical orretrospective cohort or case-control studies are not faced with this potential bias (though theyencounter others).Let us be charitable for a moment and suppose that RCTs do manage to control for one ortwo types of bias. Let's say my arguments about selection and ascertainment bias are refuted, orthat other biases are found that only RCTs can manage. This does not mean the collapse of myargument that RCTs are no better at controlling for bias than other study designs. This is becauseeven if RCTs did manage to control for one or two biases that no other trial could address, it islikely that the same could be argued for other research methods. Perhaps there are unique formsof bias faced only by case studies, which only case studies can address. This does not mean thatcase studies are more objective or value-free. In a sense, what such studies have done is create aproblem and then solve it. But other trials may not be faced with that problem. So it is notmeaningful to suggest that such trials are more objective simply because they have conqueredone or two particular biases.Furthermore, it is not clear to me why we should think that all biases are created equal.Some biases appear to have a more significant distorting affect on the results of experiments thanothers. Even if RCTs could control for selection bias in a way that no other trial could, and alltrials faced concerns about selection bias, it may be that selection bias is a small player in therealm of bias. I would argue, along these lines, that the forms of bias earliest in the design ofresearch are likely to have the greatest impact on the objectivity of results - and these are theforms of bias that we have no specific rules or mechanisms in place to address. Choices of studytopic, research method, and population of interest have a tremendous effect on the results ofresearch, but are relatively subjective.The catalogues of bias produced by Sackett, Jadad and Enkin serve to remind EBMadvocates of the precarious and imperfect nature of all evidence, including that produced by thegold standard method in medical research. There are dozens of possible biases influencingresearch at any given moment. While we might manage to control for some of these sources ofbias through strict methodological requirements of research, there are many others that willremain. This provides a timely reminder of the need for critical reflection on the results of even146the best research, and the importance of educating physicians and patients on how to deal withuncertainty. It also encourages us to take a closer look at what we mean by bias in medicine.For every bias, or negative value, on the list of biases provided by Enkin and Jadad, thereis a corresponding positive value. We avoid hidden agenda bias because we assign a positivevalue to open agendas. We avoid publication bias because we assign a positive value to equalityor justice in the evaluation of publications. These positive values, in turn, are justified on thebasis of epistemological assumptions about how to best arrive at knowledge in the scientificdomain. As Longino puts it, \"[T]he question of whether social values can play a positive role inthe sciences is really the wrong question. Social and contextual values do play a role, andwhether it is positive or negative depends on our orientation to the particular values inquestion.\"79 This indicates a need for greater attention to the role of values in medical research.Identifying and evaluating biases that have a negative impact on inquiry is an important project,as is the re-education of health care professionals regarding the positive and productive role ofvalues in inquiry. Without an appreciation for this range of roles, the job of weeding out negativevalues will be superficial and ultimately unhelpful. Thus, there is a need for transparency aboutall values in research. In line with the CCE norms, we need to recognize that these pervasivevalues and assumptions need to be critically discussed and evaluated in order to ensure thatidiosyncratic assumptions and values are not unduly shaping research.3.4. Conclusions on BiasEven in the most methodologically rigorous studies, significant biases can occur. Especially inthe case of larger studies and meta-analyses, \"While trials can be scrutinized for gross errors ofmethodology, and excluded if such are found, less obvious but still material differences inprocedure may not be apparent to a scrutiny diffused over a number of protocols.\"80 Thesedifferences in procedure can be manipulated to achieve different effects. Researchers have beenquite inventive at coming up with new ways to subvert legitimate inquiry (without committingoutright fraud) including: sub-optimal dosing of the competitor's drug in a head-to-head trial,testing on young people (in order to minimize the number of adverse reactions), publication of 79 Longino, Science as Social Knowledge, 218.80 Black, 1.147only positive results, publication of only part of the results of a trial, analysis on the basis ofsecondary endpoints when primary endpoints do not indicate a significant effect of the treatment,and so on.81 Specific drug studies were examined in one review, and the authors found that,\"while there was no relationship between drug company funding and study quality, those studieswhich were supported by a drug company were significantly more likely to have an outcomefavouring the drug of interest (98% vs. 79%).\"82 In other words, despite equally good methods inthe different studies, bias still played a role in the research outcome. This is no surprise given thecatalogue of biases in RCTs outlined by Jadad and Enkin.Even if we were to set aside global social concerns about political and economicinfluences on the direction of research, and the individual biases introduced by researchers, thecatalogues of specific biases identified by Sackett, Enkin and Jadad suggests that bias can anddoes play a pervasive role in research. These findings have direct implications for an evidencehierarchy that claims to diminish bias through methodological rigour. RCTs are widely thoughtto be more objective (less confounded) than other trial designs. What is particularly interesting isthat the one or two biases on this list that RCTs are thought to be especially designed to eliminateare either equally well managed by other methodologies (because they are unrelated torandomization) or they are not encountered by other methodologies. As such, the claim thatRCTs are, by design, more objective than other trials is false.83 And bias is still a problem in needof a solution.844. QuantifiabilityNoted EBM critic, Alvan the \"distraction of quantitative methods\" inmedicine, which has been particularly common in the last three decades.85 Quantitative 81 Parker, \"Whither our art?\" 274; Angell, The Truth About the Drug Companies; Sackett and Oxman. A case couldbe made that some of these choices constitute fraud, which no methodology can prevent. However, because many ofthese choices have to be made in the course of research-as-usual, it may be difficult to make the case that one choiceis fraud while another is not (for instance, one choice of inclusion criteria is inappropriate while another is not).There are grey areas here between honest research and fraud, and that is precisely where these manipulations comeinto play.82 Norman, \"Examining the assumptions of and MacKenzie, \"The Randomised Controlled Trial: Gold Standard, Or Merely Standard?\"84 Mechanisms for dealing with biases in research will be discussed in greater detail in the final chapter of thisdissertation.85 Feinstein, \"Clinical Judgment Revisited: The Distraction of Quantitative Methods.\"148outcomes, research methods and methods of data analysis are celebrated within the evidencehierarchy. This focus on quantification in medicine relates to the previous discussion on bias,since rules and numbers can perform similar functions in inquiry. According to Theodore Porter,one of these functions is the projection of value-freedom. Decisions made \"by the numbers\", orby explicit rules, appear to be fair and impartial.86 Evidence at the top of the hierarchy is bothproduced by explicit rules designed to eliminate bias (discussed above) and quantified. In whatfollows I will explain the EBM position on qualitative research, provide examples of the manyuses of qualitative research in medicine, and conclude with thoughts about why qualitativeresearch has been devalued within EBM. If it is true that \"[a]n analytical, quantitative and criticalapproach to medical data is on the rise,\" I investigate whether this focus on quantitative researchis justified.874.1. Qualitative Research and EBMThe original evidence hierarchies either made no mention of qualitative research or ranked itnear or at the bottom alongside anecdotal evidence and case-studies.88 The most recent handbookon EBM devotes \"a few words\" and less than three pages to the assessment of qualitativeresearch, noting in particular that qualitative research \"may provide us with some guidance indeciding whether we can apply the findings from quantitative studies to our patients.\"89 This ishardly an enthusiastic endorsement. It likely reflects a more common perception of qualitativeresearch as \"frivolous, faddish, and devoid of real substance, value and utility.\"90 Similarly, inthe original \"Users' Guides to the Medical Literature\" series in JAMA, Mita Giacomini andDeborah Cook (on behalf of the EBM Working Group) suggest that \"qualitative studies offer analternative when insight into the research is not well established or when conventional theoriesseem inadequate.\"91 Again, the endorsement here is weak: qualitative research can be helpfulonly when other (presumably better) methods have failed. Recently there have been efforts tocreate separate qualitative evidence hierarchies and corresponding guidelines. The Campbell 86 Porter, Trust in Numbers, 8.87 Schattner and Fletcher, \"Research Evidence and the Individual Guides to the Medical Literature: XXIII. Qualitative Research in Health Care A.Are the Results of the Study Valid?\" 357.149Collaboration - which mirrors the quantitatively focused Cochrane Collaboration - wasestablished in 2000 to analyze the results of qualitative research. In spite of the advances in thevisibility of qualitative studies, qualitative researchers face an uphill battle for recognition andqualitative research is far less likely than quantitative research to influence clinical practice.924.2. What is Qualitative Research?Like quantitative research, qualitative research sets out to describe, understand and explainempirical phenomena. At the core of all qualitative projects is an emphasis on context. Wherequantitative research asks questions about frequency and quantity, qualitative research asks'what?', 'why?' and 'how?' While quantitative inquiry is often concerned with hypothesistesting, qualitative inquiry is more often interested hypothesis generation or theory construction.Qualitative inquiry is characterized by certain research frameworks (e.g. constructivism), typesof data (e.g. stories), research methods (e.g. grounded theory), techniques for data collection (e.g.interviewing), techniques for data analysis (e.g. constant comparison), and techniques forinterpretation (e.g. hermeneutics).93 Qualitative research methods not only generate data usingunique methods such as focus groups, they also study naturally occurring events usingethnography or video recordings, and provide theoretical analyses of documents, texts andpractices.94 Qualitative research is frequently described as \"deficient\" when compared toquantitative research. Because qualitative research draws upon methods and processes seen ascontaminated by quantitative researchers (such as disciplined subjectivity) it is oftencharacterized as \"limited\".95In contrast with these negative characterizations, qualitative research has many uses inthe medical context. First, qualitative research can provide critical analysis of key medicalconcepts, and so shape their use in research and practice. The redefinition of \"non-compliance\" 92 There are a few notable exceptions within the EBM community. I will discuss those below.93 Sandelowski, \"'To Be Of Use',\" 125. Sandelowski goes on to point out that the separation between quantitativeand qualitative research is not nearly as simplistic as it appears, though it is often useful to use the simple categoriesin discussions. In reality, however, \" 'Qualitative' researchers count, use statistical methods, and qualitatively testhypotheses. 'Quantitative' researchers engage in flights of fancy, seek the perspectives of their subjects, andinterpret verbal data,\" 126.94 Barbour, \"The role of qualitative broadening the 'evidence base' for clinical practice.\"95 Sandelowski notes that while the methods of purposeful sampling are referred to as 'non-probability' sampling,you would be hard-pressed to find reference to probability sampling as 'nonpurposeful'. The value judgementimplicit in such descriptions reflects a general distrust of qualitative methods in the more-quantitative literature, 126.150as \"self-regulation\" is one example.96 This sort of research helps explain apparently illogicalpatient behaviour (such as refusal of the flu shot) in different, more patient-centered terms. Thegoal of qualitative research is \"not the mere accumulation of information, but rather thetransformation of understanding.\"97 Because changes in understanding often reform rather thanbuild upon existing knowledge, it can seem like qualitative research does not advance with thesame sort of momentum as quantitative research, but this misses out on the important conceptualwork being done by qualitative research, and the sorts of diverse perspectives highlighted byqualitative methods.Second, qualitative research can provide complementary analyses that contextualizequantitative results. For instance, qualitative studies can provide explanations for the unusual orunexpected results of quantitative trials, such as the reasons for poor compliance among aparticular subgroup in a clinical trial. Additionally, qualitative research can suggest mechanismsfor outcomes discovered in observational research. For instance, one group of qualitativeresearchers investigated the reasons why childhood accidents differed among certain subgroupsand suggested a possible explanation: social class differences in the interpretation andimplementation of safety rules.98 The epidemiological data alone indicated only that there was adifference, not why it existed. The additional information also informs possible solutions andmakes them more likely to succeed. The understanding of social processes demonstrated byqualitative studies is critical to the implementation of health policy. Qualitative research can alsogenerate hypotheses for further quantitative investigation.Third, qualitative research can stand on its own as a useful guide to clinical decision-making. For instance, qualitative research that identifies non-evidential factors influencingclinical decision-making (such as apparently irrational desires and beliefs) has helped physiciansto understand what it is that patients are seeking when they come in to a doctor's office. Onestudy, which drew on semi-structured interviews with patients and practitioners, as well asaudiotapes and interviewer notes, identified 14 types of misunderstandings related to patientinformation.99 All of the misunderstandings were associated with potential or actual adverse 96 Conrad, \"The meaning of medications.\" Conrad argues that assumptions about 'deviance' implied in theassessment of a patient as noncompliant can be recast, from the patient's perspective, as a positive description ofautonomous and informed decision-making about their personal care.97 Sandelowski, \"'To Be Of Use',\" 125.98 Sparks, Craven, and Worth, \"Understanding differences between high and low childhood accident rates areas.\"99 Britten et al., \"Misunderstandings in prescribing decisions in general practice.\"151outcomes. These included cases where information known to the patient was not passed along tothe physician, such as relevant facts about the patient's medical history or desires not to receive aprescription for further medication. Furthermore, information about treatment side-effects,dosage, and alternative options was not communicated to patients by physicians. And the list ofmiscommunications goes on. The researchers also propose solutions. They suggest that many ofthe miscommunications were associated with the patient's lack of participation in theconsultation, and they propose further qualitative work into appropriate educationalinterventions.100Another qualitative study, which investigated the processes leading to inappropriate useof pharmaceutical drugs in elderly inpatients, found that inappropriate prescribing, counselingand other interventions were most common in cases where the physician had a passive attitude tolearning, when review of treatment was driven by acute considerations, and when a paternalisticrelationship existed between the doctor and patient. 101 These findings were determined on thebasis of semi-structured interviews with doctors, nurses and pharmacists, and observation ofinpatients on the ward, as well as focus groups with selected inpatients. These sorts of findingsare vital for a proper assessment of patient needs, and could prevent the over-prescription ofmedications (which is a serious problem) and improve awareness of the value of shared decision-making and more egalitarian physician-patient relationships.Finally, qualitative research is the only kind of research that is capable of providinganswers to certain types of questions. For example, the following research questions would bebest answered with various qualitative methods: \"What are the attitudes and behaviors of ICU[intensive care unit] clinicians toward clinical practice guidelines?\"; \"What is it like for patientsleaving the ICU?\"; and \"How do critical care unit staff decide which patients are admitted to theICU?\"102 A recent study, which used grounded theory and self-administered questionnaires,examined the experiences of family members of patients in the ICU. The satisfaction of familymembers regarding the communications they had with physicians reflected preferences for threetypes of clinicians' statements: \"assurances that the patient will not be abandoned before death;assurances that the patient will be comfortable and will not suffer; and support for [the] family's 100 Ibid.101 Spinewine et al., \"Appropriateness of use medicines in elderly inpatients.\"102 Sinuff, Cook and Giacomini, 106.152decision to withdraw or not withdraw life support.\"103 Satisfaction was even greater when thesetypes of comments were repeated many times by physicians. The information gleaned from thismixed-methods study is much more helpful than anything possible using quantitative methodsalone.The results of qualitative research, when designed to address questions of clinicalimportance, are unquestionably relevant to medical decision-making. Because these results aredirectly relevant to clinical decision-making, and provide support for different aspects ofdecision-making, such as effective communication, they also demonstrate the role thatqualitative research can play in bridging the research-practice gap. It is odd that this potentialrole was neglected by designers of EBM. Insofar as the questions asked in the studies justmentioned could only have been investigated through qualitative methods, the evidencehierarchy may prevent such questions from being asked or answered.4.2.1. Aside: Why Focus on Quantitative Research?Why did the proponents of EBM de-value or even ignore qualitative methods? Most obviously,the movement arose out of the clinical epidemiology movement, which because of its roots inepidemiological methods had a traditional focus on quantitative measurements. But there arereasons beyond this. Theodore Porter has written extensively on the use of numbers and methodsof quantification in the sciences. Porter argues that numbers have always been used to indicaterigor and universality and to assist researchers in gaining the trust of others. Communicationbetween researchers is made possible by the use of numbers because they are regarded asimpartial and because they are accessible across divisions of language and culture. But whilethese somewhat more defensible reasons for quantification are present, they are usuallyaccompanied by less transparent motives. Porter writes,While...numbers and systems of quantification can be very powerful, the drive tosupplant personal judgment by quantitative rules reflects weakness and vulnerability. Iinterpret it as a response to conditions of distrust attending the absence of a secure andautonomous community.104 103 Ibid., 109.104 Porter, Trust in Numbers, xi.153Numbers can hide all sorts of questionable assumptions and practices. The boundaries ofmedicine have been contested by various outsiders over the years, from midwives to naturopaths.This puts mainstream medical professionals constantly on the defence. Quantifying data andmaking medicine appear more scientific are mechanisms for protecting it from \"quacks\".Scientific communities that choose to elevate methods of quantification are adapting in responseto challenges from within and outside their community. I will be discussing these challenges,particularly with respect to the rise of complementary and alternative medicine, in the nextchapter. The focus on quantitative methods is not necessarily problematic, however, unless it hasepistemic costs. However, those costs, as it turns out, can be high; the trade-off for quantificationis often accuracy:There is a strong incentive to prefer precise and standardized measures to highly accurateones. For most purposes, accuracy is meaningless if the same operations andmeasurements cannot be performed at other sites. This is especially true, and especiallyurgent, where the results of research are to be put to work outside the scientificcommunity.105Porter goes on to say that results are \"put to work\" in the field of medicine more so than anyother field. So while accuracy should be highly valued in medicine (one would think), it may begiven up for highly quantified results. These concerns dovetail with those raised at the beginningof the last chapter over the gap between research and practice in medicine. Accuracy onquestions that matter may be sacrificed for generalizations on questions that do not matter asmuch. Similarly, accuracy on important questions about meaning and care may be sacrificed forquantitative data on outcomes. Pursuing this path fails to acknowledge Alvan Feinstein's insight,\"not everything that is measured is important and not everything that is important can bemeasured.\"1064.3. ClarificationThere have occasionally been articles, or comments within articles, written by members of theoriginal EBM working group, in which the authors have indicated the need for a more inclusive 105 Ibid., 29.106 Feinstein. Quoted in Daly, 47.154attitude toward qualitative research than that represented by the EBM handbook or other guidesto EBM, or than is represented in the quotations above. In particular, David Sackett has offered amore reasoned position on the matter. Sackett and Wennberg write, \"Our thesis is short: thequestion being asked determines the appropriate research architecture, strategy, and tactics to beused - not tradition, authority, experts, paradigms, or schools of thought.\"107 As an example theywrite that a question about patient preferences in choice of treatment would be best investigatedwith in-depth interviews. They even make the eminently reasonable statement, \"Each methodshould flourish, because each has features that overcome the limitations of the others whenconfronted with questions they cannot reliably answer.\"108 I am obviously sympathetic with thisposition; in fact, I think it is entirely correct. The question then becomes: is this positionrepresentative of EBM? Sackett is often thought of as the father of EBM, and certainly until2000 he was one of the movement's most charismatic proponents. Why not take his statementsas reflective of the core of EBM?The view on qualitative research that Sackett presents, though laudable, is notrepresentative of the core of the EBM position for two reasons. First, Sackett's position isinconsistent with the authoritative guides produced by the current EBM working group. In 2000Sackett declared that he would never again \"lecture, write or referee anything to do withevidence-based clinical practice.\"109 At the time he claimed that this was because he had acquiredexpert status and was beginning to become an authority figure - something he recognized to beat odds with the fundamentally anti-authoritarian promises of the earliest versions of EBM.Sackett left without critiquing EBM, but the difference in the content of his statements onqualitative research (in 1997) and those quoted earlier in this section (from 2005) indicate adivide between the more critically-oriented and inclusive version of EBM Sackett seemedinclined to promote, and what Upshur has referred to as the \"profound move within EBM awayfrom fostering critical thinking, and creating a dependency on pre-interpreted, prepackagedsources of health evidence.\"110 This shift seems to have happened more recently - i.e. sinceSackett left the scene - and has corresponded with an increased reliance on a strict interpretationof the evidence hierarchy, and very little attention to qualitative research. As noted earlier, there 107 Sackett and Wennberg, 1636.108 Ibid.109 Sackett, \"The Upshur, \"The Hard Art of Soft Science,\" 421.155are only cursory, hand-wavy statements on qualitative research in most guides today. The tensionbetween the original commitments of EBM: to critical evaluation and to the provision ofevidence that is immediately useful in practice, has been settled (for the worse, I argue) in favourof evidence that is predigested and thought to be ready for application in practice. Second,Sackett's position is not representative of the core EBM position because if it were it wouldindicate the need for changes to the evidence hierarchy and this has not occurred as of the mostrecent edition of the official EBM handbook in 2005. If, as Sackett suggests, we should make useof a wide diversity of research methods, since they are each best suited to different researchquestions, a hierarchical ranking of research methods would make no sense. I will discussproblem further in the last section of the chapter. For now it will suffice to say that Sackett'sviews are unfortunately not representative of the EBM position on qualitative research today.4.4. Conclusions on QuantifiabilityA well-designed and carefully executed qualitative study attains only the lowest level ofrecognition, if any, within the current evidence hierarchy. This placement reflects some of theunderlying assumptions of EBM identified in the previous chapter, including the desire to tiemedicine more closely to a traditional conception of good science. These sorts of assumptionshave already been called into question. Quantitative evidence provides support for the technicalside of medical practice. But why would we think that evidence is only available to support thisone element of medical decision-making? Medical decision-making, as we saw in the lastchapter, is complex and involves a great number of variables. Disciplines as varied as the socialsciences, nursing, peace and conflict studies, human resource management, and education have alot to offer physicians in the way of research on communication techniques and methods forconveying empathy and care. Qualitative research has long been gaining ground as a legitimateand important form of inquiry into complex problems, and its research methods have advancedconsiderably over the last half-century.111 The decision to categorize qualitative research aslowest quality is a throwback to a scientific tradition that devalues qualitative studies asunscientific. This decision is unjustified. Further, insofar as the evidence hierarchy implies theirrelevance of qualitative research it misrepresents the nature of research. 111 Morse, Swanson, and Kuzel, The Nature of Qualitative Evidence.1565. Managing Uncertainty5.1. Uncertainty in MedicineImmanuel Kant identifies the ways in which our perception of uncertainty is magnified insituations where life and death hang in the balance: \"If, in a given case, we represent ourselves asstaking the happiness of our whole life, the triumphant tone of our judgment is greatly abated;we become extremely diffident, and discover for the first time that our belief does not reach sofar.\"112 Physicians have to deal with the weight of this uncertainty every day in situations wherecritical life and death decisions are made. Diagnoses are uncertain: What if a symptom wasmissed? What is the test was a false negative? Treatments are uncertain: What if this treatmentcauses an adverse event in this patient? What if there is a better treatment I do not know about?And so on. It is undoubtedly attractive, when in a difficult situation, to think that certainty ispossible: to think that you can figure out the right answer. After all, the alternative is makingdecisions about the lives of patients while being relatively uncertain about the outcome. The sortof paralysis that can affect a physician in this situation may be dangerous to patients in the longrun. Enter EBM, which \"deals directly with the uncertainties of clinical medicine.\"1135.2. Uncertainty and EBMAccording to the proponents of EBM, reasoning from pathophysiological principles is necessarybut not sufficient for medical decision-making. This is because \"the rationales for diagnosis andtreatment, which follow from basic pathophysiologic principles, may in fact be incorrect, leadingto inaccurate predictions about the performance of diagnostic tests and the efficacy oftreatments.\"114 Implicit in this attack on pathophysiologic reasoning is a claim that clinicalresearch evidence (particularly that obtained from RCTs) is unlikely to be incorrect. While EBMproponents do not come out and say this, since it has an air of infallibility generally thought to be 112 Kant, 825A/853B. Thanks to Ross Upshur for bringing this to my attention.113 Evidence Based Medicine Working Group, 2424.114 Guyatt et al., \"Evidence-Based Medicine,\" 2421. Emphasis added. See Chapter Four for a full examination ofthe claims with respect to pathophysiologic reasoning.157inappropriate in science, it is really this idea that research evidence gets us closer to certainty, orinfallibility, which drives a lot of the literature. One of the founders of EBM, Murray Enkin, hassaid that he was motivated to participate in developing EBM in part because it seemed to offersolid ground for decision-making in medicine. It seemed as though EBM would finally movephysicians past uncertainty and beyond bickering over best practices.115 Just as Fisher originallypromised, randomized experiments would end the need for debate and eliminate the need forinterpretation and judgement.116 Members of the EBM working group counted on the rhetoricalpower of scientific evidence to stop disputes and settle longstanding questions. They weresurprised to learn that evidence was not enough to end debates in medicine.5.3. Conclusions on UncertaintyC. David Naylor writes of the \"Malthusian\" growth of uncertainty that occurs when multipletechnologies are combined in practice:Take two technologies and they can be used in two different sequences; take five, and thenumber of possible sequences is one hundred and twenty. Furthermore, the elements in aclinical strategy are usually tested in separate studies, leaving few data on the chains ofconditional probabilities that link sequences of tests, treatments, and outcomes. The play ofuncertainty can be shown quantitatively when formal decision analysis is used as a tool tocompare clinical strategies. The outcome is often either a 'toss-up' that rests squarely in thegrey zones, or highly dependent on assumptions about one or more poorly defined variablesin the model.117In the medical context, with the variety of human responses to treatment and the variety ofcombinations of treatments, the uncertainty grows exponentially. And, contrary to expectations,sociologists Stefan Timmermans and Marc Berg argue that uncertainty has not decreased as aresult of EBM,Based on interviews with residents in evidence-based medicine programs, we show that theincorporation of EBM did not remove clinical uncertainty and the reliance on experience indecision making but instead reshuffled knowledge hierarchies and introduced new kinds ofuncertainties.118 115 Personal communication with Murray Enkin.116 Fisher, The Design of Experiments, 19.117 Naylor, 840.118 Timmermans and Berg, The Gold Standard, 28-9.158While proponents of EBM might lament this outcome, I think it was inevitable. While someincrease in certainty might be possible, and should be pursued when possible, it was ratherambitious to suggest that the evidence hierarchy would put an end to clinical uncertainty.Moreover, there is some danger that the remaining uncertainty in decision-making could beignored or downplayed by physicians who prefer to project an aura of confidence and certainty.It is a relief that this sort of obfuscation has not been widespread, since it would not have beenjustified, and would certainly have contributed in the long run to a crisis of trust in medicine.Valerie Mik\u00e9 has proposed an \"ethics of evidence\" for health professionals. This proposalconsists of two injunctions: first, medical professionals are advised to create, disseminate andmake use of scientific evidence, and second, medical professionals are impelled to recognize theirreducibly uncertain nature of evidence. Her emphasis is on the latter of the two principles, sinceit is more frequently neglected. I support these principles and argue that greater attention to theuncertainty in medical decision-making is important for the advancement of medicine.The EBM hierarchy ranks most highly those methods thought to produce the mostdefinitive and unquestionable results. This is meant to increase the certainty of physicians in theoutcomes of particular treatments. Unfortunately, the assumption that methods higher in thehierarchy produce more certain evidence and lead to more certain medical decisions has not beenborne out in practice.6. Is a Hierarchy Necessary?It is will always be useful to have clear, explicit criteria that demarcate a good RCT from a badRCT, a good-quality cohort study from a poor-quality cohort study, and a well-conductedqualitative study from a poorly-conducted qualitative study. This is not what is at issue when weask whether the evidence hierarchy of EBM is justified. What is at issue is whether it is possibleto categorically rank an RCT against, for instance, a cohort study, or a case-control study againsta qualitative study. I have argued against each of the five justifications offered for the hierarchyadvanced by EBM. I turn now to the question of whether any hierarchy of evidence could bejustified in medicine.1596.1. Different Questions, Different Methodologies\"I checked it very thoroughly,\" said the computer, \"and that quite definitely is the answer.I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you've never actually known what thequestion is.\"119The proponents of EBM claim that they are not trying to say that the best way to answer everyquestion is to conduct an RCT, just that RCTs should be performed whenever possible. Yet theevidence hierarchy seems to imply a categorical judgement about study quality regardless of thequestion under investigation. I argue that RCTs are not always better than other designs, evenwhen RCTs are possible. Some important research questions cannot be answered by RCTs, and itwould be inappropriate to allow the hierarchy to dictate the questions investigated in medicalresearch even if there are clear reasons for choosing a particular study design to match aparticular type of question.Observational trials often investigate social, environmental, and lifestyle changes thatcould not otherwise be investigated in an RCT. For instance, if we want to know whethersmoking causes cancer we are unable to randomize people into two groups - smoking and non-smoking - since people will not willingly take up or give up smoking according to the dictates ofthe trial design. Important lifestyle choices are not amenable to randomization. Further, it wouldnot be possible to blind study participants to the intervention since it will be obvious who is andis not smoking. Thus the best possible study design for answering the question, \"Does smokinglead to lung cancer?\" is a prospective cohort study. Similarly, qualitative research is valuablebecause, when it is done properly, it answers questions that could not be answered byquantitative methods. If we are interested in asking why questions, such as, for instance, \"Whydo people decide to start smoking?\" we require research methods such as surveys, interviews,and focus groups. If the question we want answered is this one, it makes no sense to say that anRCT is the best trial design. The best research method is that which provides the best answer tothe question being asked.Any hierarchy that attempts to rank research methods against each other will end upprioritizing certain research questions over others, thus restricting the scope of investigation. 119 Adams, 156.160This restriction is detrimental to medical knowledge and, by extension, medical practice.120Further, any hierarchy presumes to have established the most important questions to be asked inmedicine. The current evidence hierarchy, for example, is built on assumptions about bestevidence, where such evidence is characterized by its precision, random allocation of subjects,quantifiability, lack of bias, and certainty. Yet even if the evidence produced by RCTs were tohave these characteristics, it is not clear why we are choosing to determine what matters inmedicine according to what sort of knowledge we are currently best at producing. Medicineshould be driven by its cognitive goals and practical ends, not by what is easiest to investigate.The research questions valued most in medicine should be those that ask the most pressingquestions, not those for which we have the most rigorous methods. Otherwise we are driven bywhat we are capable of producing rather than what we need to know. To use an analogy,consider a farmer who produces wheat because she has the best equipment for harvesting wheat(the latest combine, perhaps) when her family and the local community are in need of potatoes,corn and peas. It is tempting to do what we (ostensibly) have the best tools to do, but we arebetter served by staying focused on what it is we actually need. What it is that medicine needs isa matter for deliberation. The goals of medicine should not be dictated by our researchmethods.1216.2. Methodological PluralismIn light of a lack of justifications for the current evidence hierarchy, and for evidence hierarchiesgenerally, it is worth discussing possible alternative ways of organizing evidence. Henrik Wulff,for instance, advocates viewing EBM \"not [as] a new discipline but [as] one ingredient in theproduction of good clinical care.\"122 Petticrew and Roberts have suggested the importance of\"horses for courses\" with respect to research methods, and proposed a \"matrix\" of evidence.123 120 I discuss these issues further in Chapter Six.121 Hanson and Callahan have recently edited a volume on The Goals of Medicine, which is the product of a four-year project initiated by the Hastings Center involving working groups of health professionals, philosophers, socialscientists, politicians, theologians and legal professionals from fourteen countries. While a diversity of perspectivesare offered in the volume, there is a consensus on certain core goals of medicine: 1) the prevention of disease andinjury and the promotion and maintenance of health, 2) the relief of pain and suffering caused by maladies, 3) thecare and cure of those with a malady, and the care of those who cannot be cured, and 4) the avoidance of prematuredeath and the pursuit of a peaceful death.122 Wulff in Daly, 36.123 Petticrew and Roberts, \"Evidence, hierarchies and typologies.\"161Muir Gray has developed a \"typology\" in order to schematically indicate the different strengthsof each of the research methods.124 Bluhm has proposed a \"network\" of evidence that pays closerattention to the interdependence of evidence at each level of the traditional hierarchy.125 There areno shortages of different names for what amounts to a renewed appreciation for methodologicalpluralism in medical research. Recognition of pluralism forces physicians to become more awareof the strengths and weaknesses of different research methods, and though more challenging inpractice, at least discourages the false complacency that comes with rigid hierarchies.Outspoken EBM critic Ross Upshur has provided a model of evidence that aims tocapture the variety of meaningful types of evidence in medicine as well as theirinterrelationships, without imposing any comparative ranking. The four distinct but relatedconcepts of evidence are: \"qualitative/personal\", in which evidence is narrative in nature,socially and historically context-specific and individualized; \"qualitative/general\" in whichevidence is social, historical and \"quantitative/general\" which evidence is statistical,general, impersonal and quantitative; and \"quantitative/personal\" in which evidence isquantitative, yet individualized. Of these, the emphasis of EBM has been on quantitative/generalevidence, often at the expense of other types of evidence. Exclusive focus on this one type ofevidence is unjustified. This model acknowledges the value of each type of evidence andprovides a general framework for understanding how each type of evidence can complement theothers. This does away with hierarchies altogether and embraces a more complicated - yet moreaccurate - description of the plurality of useful research methods.126Nancy Cartwright has recently, and provocatively, described the function of evidence-based standards as follows:Grading schemes [such as the evidence hierarchy] don't combine evidence at all - they gowith what's on top. But it seems to me to be daft to throw away evidence. Why are we urgedto do it? Because we don't have a good theory of exactly why and how different types ofevidence are evidence and we don't have a good account of how to make an assessment onthe basis of a total body of evidence. Since we don't have a prescription for how to do itproperly, we are urged not to do it at all. That seems daft too. But I think it is the chief reasonthat operates. That is why the philosophical task is so important.127 124 Muir Gray, Evidence-based Healthcare.125 Bluhm, and Policy,\" 15.162The philosophical task Cartwright refers to is that of developing a theory of evidence that is bothphilosophical and practicable. Traditional philosophical theories of evidence have tended tofocus on how to determine whether something is evidence (usually in terms of the probabilisticrelationship between evidence and hypothesis or on a further account of explanation).128 Theseaccounts are impractical. Practical accounts of evidence implicit in current standards of evidenceproposed by, for instance, the EBM movement, have focused on ranking different types ofevidence as better or worse than others, but have neglected the more basic question: what makessomething evidence in the first place?129 They are thus not comprehensive (or, in Cartwright'sterms, 'philosophical'). This no doubt leads to confusion over the place of expert judgement,patient values and anecdotes as evidence - as was discussed in the last chapter. A theory ofevidence should guide us in determining whether anecdotes and expert judgements are evidenceat all rather than assuming they are not because they fail to meet arbitrary standards of goodevidence captured by the assumptions underlying the evidence hierarchy.Cartwright's proposal is ambitious. In line with the contextual emphasis of CCE, Ibelieve such a theory is impossible on the grand scale. Cartwright seems set on having a grandtheory of evidence, but this simply repeats the mistakes made by proponents of EBM, who triedto offer a general theory of evidence and ended up losing touch with the contextual demands ofmedicine. I believe that a general theory of evidence is impossible and that attempts to providesuch a theory will be ultimately detrimental to our ability to contextualize the nature of evidencein particular settings. A context-specific account of evidence, however, would be a significantaddition to the medical debate. While I do not develop such an account in this dissertation, I dooutline several of the social institutions that need to be in place for discussion on such an accountto proceed (see Chapter Seven for further details). To return to the subject matter of this chapter,Cartwright's discussion reiterates the \"daftness\" of proposals to rank research methods againsteach other and the need for a less restrictive and non-hierarchical description of medicalevidence.7. Summary 128 See for instance Achinstein.129 In Cartwright's terms, what makes something candidate evidence?163The CCE framework adopted in Chapter Two stresses the importance of critically scrutinizingbackground assumptions. According to my analysis in Chapter Three, there are threefoundational background assumptions underlying EBM. In this chapter I examined the third ofthese: the assumption that a hierarchy of evidence is necessary to guide medical research andpractice. This assumption was supported by five more detailed, substantive assumptions, which Iidentified at the outset of this chapter. The evidence hierarchy ranks research methods accordingto their ability to produce evidence that is: precise, randomized, unbiased, quantified andrelatively certain. The particular version of the evidence hierarchy developed on the basis ofthese assumptions about best evidence is only justified insofar as these characteristics really dodemarcate good from bad evidence. In this chapter I have argued that each of these justificationsfails. As a result of these collective failures, and in the absence of further justifications fromEBM proponents, the attempt to justify this version of the evidence hierarchy fails. Moreover,any such attempt is incoherent. Different research questions require different research methods.Any evidence hierarchy is necessarily an attempt to rank the most important questions inmedicine, and this - even if possible - should not depend on characterizations of good evidencebut on the goals and ends of medicine. Otherwise medicine will be driven by what is possiblewithin current methods, rather than what is required by practice or most important according toits philosophy of health and disease.164Chapter SixThe Future of Evidence-based Medicine:Diversity and Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine1\"[O]nly through diversity of opinion is there, in the existing state of human intellect,a chance of fair play to all sides of the truth.\"2According to critical contextual empiricism (CCE), diversity contributes to the production ofknowledge by upholding and advancing the objectivity of inquiry.3 In light of this commitment -made more explicit in my version of the CCE norms - we have reason to ensure that the medicalcommunity adopts rules and practices that encourage diversity and responsiveness to diversity.In this chapter I investigate whether the evidence-based medicine movement moves us toward ordiverts us from these sorts of rules and practices. I argue that the EBM movement suppressesdiversity in medicine. This is manifested in two ways. First, the centerpiece of the EBMmovement - the hierarchy of evidence - overstates the epistemic value of the randomizedcontrolled trial.4 This diverts the attention of both researchers and physicians from valuableevidence at lower levels of the evidence hierarchy such as that produced by cohort, case-controland qualitative studies, and decreases the variety of both medical research questions andcorresponding treatments. Thus, EBM suppresses methodological diversity through internalconstraints on the mainstream medical community. Second, increased social and politicalpressure resulting from EBM constrains diverse perspectives offered by those outside of themedical mainstream. Researchers in complementary and alternative medicine, for instance, havebeen instructed to conform to current standards and produce RCTs if they hope to gaincredibility. This demand for conformity persists despite concerns raised about the limits of theRCT, the value of lower-ranked research methods, and methodological innovations proposed byresearchers in complementary and alternative medicine.5 In other words, EBM also provides a 1 Earlier versions of sections 1-3 of this chapter were published as: Borgerson, \"Diversity and Objectivity inMedicine\"; earlier versions of sections this chapter were published as: Borgerson, \"Evidence-basedAlternative Medicine?\"2 Mill.3 I explain and defend this argument in Chapter Two.4 Meta-analyses of RCTs are meant to be included by this statement. A full defence is offered in Chapter Five.5 Tonelli and Callahan, \"Why Alternative Medicine Cannot Be Evidence-based,\" of external constraints on methodological diversity.6 Moreover, these externalconstraints also diminish the presence of diverse metaphysical accounts of health and diseasesuch as those underpinning various CAM approaches. Thus EBM suppresses the development ofalternative theoretical frameworks or what I will call theoretical diversity.7 In the CAM context,the methodological and theoretical issues are often intertwined.In what follows, I begin with a brief discussion of the internal constraints onmethodological diversity, which build on arguments in the previous chapter. I then turn to a morecomprehensive analysis of the ways in which EBM inhibits the development of bothmethodological and theoretical diversity through external constraints. To this end I examinecurrent debates in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). In order to regain a healthyattitude toward diversity in medicine, I argue that mainstream medical researchers should payattention to the developments in complementary and alternative medical research. I outline anumber of CAM innovations and discuss some of the ways in which CAM research provides avital critical perspective on the background assumptions of EBM.1. Internal Constraints on Methodological DiversityThe EBM movement is, at its core, an attempt to make medicine more standardized.8 It is nosurprise, then, that the EBM approach contributes to a restriction on diversity within the domainof medicine. As proponents of the EBM movement have freely admitted, the movement has ledto a somewhat zealous support for RCTs and a near-dismissal of all other sources of evidence.9Proponents of EBM \"almost succeeded in colonizing the meaning of the word evidence, so that itbecomes synonymous with that evidence produced by a randomized controlled trial.\"10 Becauseresearchers face various community incentives to publish research, and require funding fromagencies that uphold the EBM hierarchy, researchers have been compelled to produce RCTswhenever possible. And because medical guidelines are based largely (if not fully) on the resultsof meta-analyses and systematic reviews of RCTs, there is little incentive for researchers tobother producing research based on any of the other methods. Of course, these other research 6 These are external constraints because they are placed on members of other communities.7 This could also be called metaphysical or framework diversity.8 Timmermans and Berg.9 Daly.10 Ibid., 231-2.166methods have not been totally abandoned, but EBM has certainly diverted researchers from usinga variety of study designs.11In addition to the arguments I have already made about the shortcomings of the evidencehierarchy, I would like to highlight the impact of any evidence hierarchy on methodologicaldiversity. Because every research method is able to address a specific range of questions, thediversity of research questions decreases whenever research methodologies are limited. Thisbears repeating. The range of research questions that can be asked and legitimately pursuedwithin the mainstream medical community is circumscribed by the EBM hierarchy of evidence.This, after all, is essentially the point of any hierarchy of evidence: focusing attention on certaintypes of evidence at the expense of others. The result, in this case, has been a significant decreasein the production, publication and institutional influence of studies ranked in the middle and nearthe bottom of the hierarchy. A narrow range of research questions corresponding to one or twobest research methodologies means a narrow range of research results. This has immediateimplications for practice. The evidence hierarchy decreases attention to certain methodologicaldesigns and thus limits the range of possible treatments available to patients.12 Failure toappropriately value the contributions made by a variety of research methods leads to a decreasein methodological diversity within mainstream medicine.132. External Constraints on Methodological and Theoretical DiversityThere is a great deal of social, economic and political power behind the EBM movement. Thispower not only influences the research patterns within mainstream medical research, as notedabove, but also places tremendous pressure on researchers outside the medical mainstream toproduce what it deems top-ranked evidence. Most complementary and alternative medicalresearchers - like those in mainstream medicine - wish to evaluate their therapies using methods 11 The term \"randophilia\" was coined by Alvan Feinstein to capture the obsession with randomized trials that tookplace with the introduction of EBM. Feinstein was one of most outspoken critics of EBM in the 1990s. Ibid., 104.12 To be more specific, the current evidence hierarchy valorizes methodologies that are best suited to studyinterventions such as pharmaceutical drugs (which are easiest to placebo-control), and least well suited to studybehavioral, environmental, and other lifestyle or preventative interventions. This problem is discussed later in thischapter.13 \"[W]e get little new understanding of the barriers to change in relation to either patients or practitioners, and theinterventions designed for overcoming these barriers continue to be hit or miss. This is a case where we needdiversification of research methods, and other evidence.\" Ibid., 232.167that are rigorous and that are consistent with their philosophies of medicine and healing. Theseinvestigators have three ways to relate their work to EBM. They can accept the EBM hierarchyand carry out RCTs when possible; they can accept the EBM standards but argue that the specialcharacteristics of alternative medicine warrant the acceptance of 'lower' forms of evidence; orthey can challenge the EBM approach and work to develop new research designs and newstandards of evidence that reflect their approach to medical care. For several reasons, this lastoption is preferable. First, it will best meet the needs of alternative medical practitioners.Moreover, because similar problems beset the evaluation of mainstream medical therapies, re-evaluation of standards of evidence will benefit everyone in the medical community - including,most importantly, patients.3. What is Complementary and Alternative Medicine?What is considered to be mainstream medicine in North America today is the result of social,political and economic forces in the past century. The boundaries of mainstream medicine do notcorrespond with any formal distinction between science and pseudo-science. For this reason, andbecause mainstream medicine is continually evolving to include and exclude different practicesand therapies, it is difficult to accurately define complementary and alternative medicine.Because CAM is a catch-all term used to refer (loosely) to those practices outside themainstream, and is therefore highly context dependent, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)defines complementary and alternative medicine as:All health systems, modalities and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs,other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular societyor culture in a given historical period.14This allows traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to be a mainstream approach in China, where itis practiced widely in mainstream hospitals. TCM is, on the other hand, alternative in Canada.This broad definition, as applied in North America, encompasses biologically-based treatments(herbs, special diets, and vitamins), manipulative and body-based treatments (chiropractic,massage, and osteopathy), energy therapies (reiki, magnet therapy, and qi gong), mind-body 14 National Institute of Health Panel on Definition and Description. \"Defining and describing complementary andalternative medicine.\"168treatments (yoga, spirituality, relaxation, and meditation), and entire alternative medical systems(traditional Chinese medicine, naturopathy, and homeopathy). Alternative medicine is oftencontrasted with mainstream, conventional, or Western medicine.15Alternative medicine has a tremendous amount of public support in North America.Americans spent between $37 and $47 billion on alternative medicine in 1997, and thesenumbers are growing. According to the most recent survey released by the U.S. National Centerfor Health Statistics (NCHS), approximately 36% of American adults are currently using someform of alternative medicine.16 Similar polls in Canada indicated that between 42 and 50% of thepopulation have used some form of alternative medicine in the past year. This was a more than80% increase when compared with a poll conducted five years earlier.17 Despite what criticscontinue to regard as a serious lack of scientific evidence, alternative medicine appears to begaining acceptance throughout North America.184. Expectations from Mainstream MedicineIn an influential clinical epidemiology textbook, Sackett and colleagues argue for the increaseduse of research evidence in practice. One of the reasons they offer is that \"to base yourtreatments of commonly encountered problems on the advice of some 'expert' who publishestreatment recommendations but no supporting evidence puts you on par with the barefootdoctor.\"19 According to Sackett and colleagues, one can avoid sinking to the level of the barefootdoctor by shifting ones alliance to the \"scientifically rigorous\" methods of the randomizedcontrolled trial.20 As this position makes apparent, the tension between mainstream andalternative medicine plays no small part in the debate over EBM. Two articles in top medicaljournals typify the mainstream reaction to alternative medicine:There is no alternative medicine. There is only scientifically proven, evidence-basedmedicine supported by solid data or unproven medicine, for which scientific evidence islacking. Whether a therapeutic practice is \"Eastern\" or \"Western,\" is unconventional or 15 These terms are used interchangeably.16 National Institutes of Health, \"The use of complementary and alternative medicine in the United States.\"17 Angus Reid, \"Canadian poll details 'Alternative 195. Emphasis added.20 Ibid., 194.169mainstream or involves mind-body techniques or molecular genetics is largely irrelevantexcept for historical purposes and cultural interest.21It is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride.There cannot be two kinds of medicine\u2014conventional and alternative. There is onlymedicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that worksand medicine that may or may not work. Once a treatment has been tested rigorously, itno longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset. If it is found to bereasonably safe and effective, it will be accepted. But assertions, speculation, andtestimonials do not substitute for evidence. Alternative treatments should be subjected toscientific testing no less rigorous than that required for conventional treatments.22According to these powerful demands, alternative medical researchers should strive to conductthe same sorts of clinical trials currently regarded as the gold standard of medical research.Journal articles such as \"A warning to complementary medicine practitioners: get empirical orelse,\" in which CAM researchers are advised to start producing RCTs, convey these expectationsin an admirably candid way.23 CAM research must, at the very least, meet current standards; insome cases, CAM research is even required to exceed current standards, based on certainBayesian ideas that advise extra scrutiny for those practices and treatments that have low priorprobabilities.24 Conformity to mainstream research methodologies is not requested, butdemanded. And these demands are being heard.5. The Sameness Approach25The push for evidence-based CAM is reflected in the CAM literature and in the recent creationof journals such as Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine, which are seen as 21 Fontanarosa and Lundberg, \"Alternative \"Commentary: a complementary medicine practitioners: get empirical or else,\" 1632.24 Of course, alternative medical research is not alone in failing to live up to current standards of evidence. AsMorreim points out, \"Much of actual clinical practice does not and never can measure up to the scientific standardsto which critics of CAM would like to hold alternative modalities\" (222). A large percentage (roughly estimatedaround 80%, though the exact figures are highly contested) of medical treatments currently offered in hospitals andclinics across North America have never been tested by an RCT. Research into alternative medicine is required tomeet the highest standards even though many currently accepted medical practices have not met (and may nevermeet) those same standards. University of Sheffield.25 Characterizing the choices as the \"sameness\" and \"difference\" approaches reflects the influence of CatharineMacKinnon on this chapter. MacKinnon, Toward a Feminist Theory of the State. An earlier version of this chapterwas published as a working paper and this earlier version retains more of the explicitly feminist framework:Borgerson, \"Playing by the Rules.\"170an important step forward for CAM research. 26 The research department at the Canadian Collegeof Naturopathic Medicine performs RCTs, meta-analyses and systematic reviews almostexclusively.27 In an article summing up CAM perspectives on research, Fitter and Thomasreinforce these expectations of mainstream medicine, \"The pervading view that a classical RCTwill always be the first-choice methodology for any evaluation means that if, for any reason, itcannot be used, the resulting study is judged to provide less persuasive findings: they will besecond best.\"28 There are a number of advantages to playing by the rules of EBM. EBM has beenwidely accepted in medical schools and research institutes around the world as the best approachto medical decision-making and as an excellent guide for the assessment of researchmethodologies. As such, it influences the evaluation of studies by medical journals and theallocation of research dollars by funding agencies. Alternative medical researchers could veryeasily concede the legitimacy of this approach and try to work within in. If researchers inalternative medicine are motivated by a desire to earn legitimacy for what they believe to beexcellent and often overlooked treatments, they may be motivated to become \"evidence-based\".Alternative medical researchers may also concede to mainstream demands out of a desire to beincluded under medical insurance plans or, in the case of members of the nutraceutical industry,by a desire to influence the prescribing power of physicians and practitioners.29Some alternative medical researchers have taken the demands for \"gold standard\"research seriously and, especially in the last decade or so, there have been many studiesevaluating a variety of alternative medical treatments. Some results have been negative; forexample, in two studies published in the 1998 special issue of JAMA dedicated to alternativemedicine acupuncture was found to be no more effective than placebo in relieving pain causedby HIV-related peripheral neuropathy and Garcinia cambogia failed to produce significantweight loss.3031 On the other hand, the use of moxibustion (burning herbs at an acupuncture point) 26 Mills and Wilson, \"Introducing Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine.\" The journal'Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine' (Oxford University Press) was created in 2004.27 Personal correspondence with Kieran Cooley, ND, Assistant Professor and Research Trial Coordinator at theCanadian College of Naturopathic Medicine (CCNM).28 Fitter and Thomas, \"Evaluating complementary therapies for use in the National Health Service,\" 91.29 Neutraceuticals are food substances that are thought to have health benefits. For example, red wine and garlic arebelieved to have antioxidant effects. Many herbs are also included in this category since they are often thought of asboth foods and drugs.30 Shlay et al. \"Acupuncture and amitriptyline pain due to HIV-related peripheral neuropathy: a randomizedcontrolled trial.\"171to correct breech presentation in late pregnancy, TCM herbs for irritable bowel syndrome,glucosamine for the treatment of osteoarthritis, and acupuncture for nausea and vomiting, amongothers, have been shown to be effective in RCTs.32333435 In addition, the Cochrane collaborationhas, as of July 2007, produced meta-analyses of 275 CAM treatments, which pooled over 7,000individual RCTs. While many of the meta-analyses indicated no effect of the treatment underinvestigation, a good number were positive.3637 There are plenty of examples of alternativemedical research that has adhered to the standards outlined by EBM. Many of these successfultreatments, despite achieving the status of best evidence, have not been accepted into mainstreammedical practice, although there is some indication that medical students and new physicians aretaking more of an interest in certain alternative treatments.38 The vast majority of alternativemedical treatments, however, are not even at this preliminary stage of acceptance.6. The Difference ApproachWhile many CAM communities have begun to adopt evidence-based rules and practices,members of a vocal minority resist this assimilation. These practitioners and researchers arguethat because they practice in a \"different paradigm\", from a different world view, and hold adifferent philosophy, they should not be held to the same standards as \"Western\" medicalresearch. In essence, they accept the EBM hierarchy as legitimate for scientific evaluation butargue that special exceptions should be made for alternative medical research because it isdifferent and cannot meet the standards of EBM. Even with increased emphasis on RCTs today,there are CAM researcher who prefer to use lower-ranked research methods. According to 31 Heymsfield et al. \"Garcinia Cambogia (hydroxycitric randomized controlled trial.\"33 Bensoussan, et al. \"Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with Chinese herbal medicine: A randomizedcontrolled trial.\"34 McAlindon et al. \"Glucosamine and chondroitin for treatment of osteoarthritis: A systematic quality assessmentand meta-analysis.\"35 National Institutes of Health. \"Acupuncture.\"36 The Cochrane Collaboration. A survey of these meta-analyses, in 2004, indicated that, of the 145 reviewsavailable at the time, \"the largest number of reviews were classified as insufficient evidence (n=82, 56.6%);followed by positive effect (n=36, 24.8%); possibly 12.4%); and no effect (n=7, 4.8%). Oneeach was classified in the other two categories [equal effect of two treatments, and harmful effect].\" Manheimer etal., \"Cochrane reviews of complementary and alternative therapies: evaluating the strength of the evidence.\"37 Two examples of positively reviewed CAM treatments are: Herxheimer and Petrie, \"Melatonin for preventing andtreating jet lag.\" and Pittler and for chronic venous insufficiency.\"38 Maha and Shaw.172proponents, alternative medical treatments are often highly individualized (as compared to thegeneralized treatments offered in an RCT), complex (have a number of therapeutic components),require physical treatment to which it is difficult to \"blind\" patients and practitioners (forexample, needling in acupuncture), actively involve the therapist and patient as integral parts oftreatment (making randomization and standardization difficult), set different (and multiple) endpoints based on different philosophies of medicine, and rely on principles of self-healing andmind-body control (which incorporate, rather than rule out, the placebo effect).39 These and otherproblems, including social and economic difficulties in funding and organizing large-scalestudies on often un-patentable treatments, are often raised as explanations for the persistence oflower ranked research methods in alternative medicine.In response to these appeals to difference, critics decry the \"quackery\" of alternativemedicine and caution patients to avoid alternative medical practitioners. Even people who aregenerally sympathetic to alternative medicine respond negatively to this sort of approach. Arepresentative response is offered by Wayne Jonas, \"Claiming that their practices are too'individual' or 'holistic' to study scientifically, many alternative medical practices hide behindanecdote, case series, or 'outcomes' research.\"40 Notice here that anything short of fullcommitment to the EBM hierarchy is provoking this response - even observational research isnot enough. (This illustrates the elevation of the RCT within the medical community and theclear demands for RCT evidence placed on alternative medical researchers.) Alternative medicalresearchers have found that there is no guarantee that labeling yourself different will earn youany respect from the mainstream medical community. In fact, it is just as likely, if not morelikely, to lead to worse treatment. In the eyes of the mainstream medical community, there is anepistemological standard that alternative medicine simply fails to meet. When it is assumed thateveryone should meet the same standard, an appeal to difference comes across as a sign ofweakness - an indication of failure and an appeal for special treatment.417. What Gets Lost in Either Approach 39 Anthony, \"Some methodological problems in the assessment of complementary therapy.\"40 Jonas, \"Alternative medicine - Learning from the past, examining the present, advancing to the future,\" 1616-17.41 MacKinnon, Toward a Feminist Theory of the State.173Both of the approaches just outlined have shortcomings. In what follows, I briefly discuss theshortcomings of the difference approach before turning to an in-depth critical analysis of thesameness approach.7.1. The Difference Approach: Empirical EvaluationThe difference approach is more obviously problematic than the sameness approach. WhenCAM researchers rest on their differences and request special treatment, this undermines manyof the motivations that alternative health researchers begin with - including the desire to gainlegitimacy for alternative treatments and the desire to become part of the scientific community inorder to discover which alternative treatments \"really work.\" There are good reasons for anyoneto accept at least the most basic principles of scientific research, including empirical testing andattempts at falsification of hypotheses. Even though they may not translate directly into theevidence hierarchy, there are some basic elements of good evidence (trial-and-error empiricism,for example) that can be agreed upon and should be upheld. As long as there are con artists withan interest in selling bogus remedies there will be a need for ways of distinguishing goodtreatments from harmful ones. Anyone truly dedicated to the health of others will recognize thevalue of having mechanisms for determining which treatments are effective and which are not.Applying for special exemptions from the demands of EBM could be tempting, but requires thatresearchers write off the value of the scientific endeavor - a decision that, for reasons far beyondthose just outlined, is far from ideal.7.2. The Sameness Approach: Methodological and Theoretical DiversityThe social influence of EBM contributes to a decrease in the diversity of competing theories byrequiring the assimilation of alternative theories of health, and alternative methodologies, to themainstream theoretical framework. In order to demonstrate the loss of theoretical andmethodological diversity that can occur when CAM researchers blindly adhere to EBM standardsI will outline the challenges faced by CAM researchers as they attempt to design studies that areboth scientifically rigorous and relevant to their medical practice. To narrow the focus, I considerresearchers in naturopathic medicine. Although homeopaths and TCM practitioners may face174distinct problems that are not fully incorporated into this discussion, many of the challengesfaced by naturopaths (the \"GPs\" of alternative medicine) are likely to be similar to thoseencountered by other alternative systems.7.2.1. Case: Naturopathic MedicineThe guiding principles of naturopathic medicine are:1. Do no harm2. Identify and treat the causes3. View the doctor as a teacher4. Treat the whole person5. Emphasize prevention6. Support the healing power of the body42Naturopathic doctors are directed to treat each patient by taking into account individual physical,mental, emotional, environmental, and social factors. The patient is a vital part of the healingprocess and is encouraged to take personal responsibility for his or her own health. Treatmentsare offered that enhance and support the healing power of the body. Naturopaths employ aselection of treatment modalities usually including Asian medicine/acupuncture, botanical(herbal) medicine, clinical nutrition, homeopathy, lifestyle counseling, and physical medicine(massage, ultrasound, hydrotherapy, etc.).Researchers and practitioners in naturopathic medicine encounter a number of challengeswhen attempting to follow the EBM approach. Some of these difficulties are shared bymainstream physicians. For instance, because of the naturopathic commitment to highlyindividualized care, there are a number of challenges in applying the results of highlygeneralized evidence to patients. The problem, which may be somewhat more noticeable innaturopathic medicine because of the number of patients with chronic or multiple conditions, isthat \"excellent evidence does not necessarily translate into excellent or successful therapy.\"43 Wesaw concerns of this type raised by mainstream physicians in Chapter Four. Similarly, thenaturopathic commitment to \"view the doctor as a teacher\" highlights the importance of listening 42 Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine (CCNM).43 Upshur, \"Seven Characteristics of Medical Evidence,\" 94.175to and educating patients, rather than taking an overly paternalistic approach to their care.Because of the expectation that teachers are themselves lifelong learners, this commitmenthighlights the importance of shared decision-making in naturopathy. Concerns that the EBMapproach is in tension with shared decision-making were discussed in Chapter Four. In additionto the extensive overlap in the concerns of naturopaths and mainstream physicians on thesepoints, there are two further naturopathic principles that add new perspectives to the assessmentof EBM.7.2.1.1. \"Treat the Whole Person\"The naturopathic principle, \"treat the whole person,\" reflects a commitment to providingtreatments which address as many of the complex causes of illness and disease as possible.Because of this, naturopaths often recommend a variety of treatments for a single condition, fromnutritional changes to physical treatments such as acupuncture. In tension with this multifacetedapproach to care, naturopaths note the trend toward pharmaceutical treatments for all illnesseswhich is currently underway in mainstream medical research and practice. Mainstreamphysicians are, more than ever before, prescribing drugs as the treatment of choice for anypresented condition.44 It would be surprising if this was unrelated to the type of research beingemphasized in the medical community. Research questions that fit within the RCT design arelimited to variations of: 'is treatment x effective for condition y' where x is a single variable andy is a specific outcome. The RCT is well suited to the evaluation of drugs. As Wendy Rogers haswritten,[The EBM] way of defining problems lends itself to a research agenda in which theimmediate and identifiable causes are investigated and treated. The focus is upon physicalinterventions acting on the diseased person, such as taking medicines to kill infectiousagents.45This is supported by extensive anecdotal evidence, as well as studies such as that by Everitt,Avorn, and Baker, in which general practitioners were presented with the hypothetical case of anelderly patient suffering from insomnia (one of the most common symptoms in outpatient 44 Angell.45 Rogers, \"Evidence-based Medicine and Women,\" 68.176medicine), and \"despite many possible non-pharmacologic therapies for the patients presented,46% of physicians identified a prescription medication as the single most effective therapy.\"46The population of North America is one of the most heavily medicated in the world (some wouldsuggest \"overmedicated\").47 Making judgements about the care of individual patients on the basisof RCT research alone may contribute to this problem. Insofar as EBM encourages physicians totreat on the basis of evidence from RCTs, it is also implicated in this growing problem.Consider the following situation. A mainstream physician practicing EBM encounters apatient who is suffering from asthma and who is in need of treatment. Upon formulating aquestion, completing a literature search on MEDLINE and narrowing the results to meta-analyses of RCTs, she discovers that corticosteroids are highly effective for the treatment (that is,symptom management) of asthma. We see here both the limitations and significant advantages ofthe evidence-based approach. The physician was able to find good quality evidence for theeffectiveness of a treatment very quickly, and with minimal hassle. The evidence hierarchyallows physicians to begin to order and organize what might otherwise be an overwhelmingamount of information. It also guides the physician to the best RCT evidence - so he or shewould no longer consider prescribing outdated treatments for asthma, for instance.Unfortunately, the reliance on this hierarchy also means that the physician overlooks the studieslower in the hierarchy that also attempt to answer the question, \"What treatment is effective forasthma?\" though in a slightly different way, or perhaps in different contexts or settings.Given that RCTs are designed to mimic a closed, controlled setting in which only onevariable is studied and neither the physician nor patient are aware of which treatment is beingadministered, it cannot be used to evaluate certain types of treatments. Because social andenvironmental systems are open and dynamic, different types of research methodologies havebeen designed for evaluating treatments in those settings. Observational research on treatmentsfor asthma might have yielded results indicating that asthma rates are affected by environmentalconditions such as intense heat and smog, and that moving to different environmental settingscan be very helpful for the management of asthma symptoms. The research might also havesuggested the value of lifestyle interventions such as changes in nutrition or exercise. Thisinformation was not examined by the physician in this example, nor did it affect the suggestions 46 Everitt, Avorn, and Baker, \"Clinical decision-making in the evaluation and treatment of insomnia.\"47 Harvard medical professor and former co-editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, Marcia Angell, says,\"In my view we have become an overmedicated society.\" Angell, The Truth About the Drug Companies, 169.177made to the patient. If there is a meta-analysis of RCTs indicating that a pharmaceutical drug iseffective in the treatment of asthma, and merely qualitative evidence suggesting the effectivenessof exercise or other lifestyle changes, the physician who adheres closely to the evidencehierarchy would be inclined to treat the patient according to the highest ranked evidence andprescribe the drug.For asthma, the common sense treatment in a particular case may often be lifestylechanges such as quitting smoking and spending less time in a smoggy city during the summer. Iam sure any conscientious physician would point out that the treatments beyond pharmaceuticaldrugs are common sense and that physicians are aware of them and do make a point of treatingpatients in a wide variety of ways. And I am sure this is true: overweight people are advised toadjust their diets and to increase their daily exercise, people with depression are counseled onlife-style changes that may be helpful, and those with asthma are offered advice about how toadjust their environment. What it is critical to realize, though, is that insofar as physicians act inthis way, they are relying heavily on the \"judicious\" and \"conscientious\" elements of the EBMdefinition. They are, in effect, bypassing the evidence hierarchy. In fact, this is precisely whythe second definition of EBM had to be introduced. If physicians adhere too strictly to the EBMhierarchy, they might end up prescribing drugs all the time, even though life-style interventionsare sometimes the better choice.48 The introduction of the phrase \"conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current bestevidence\" to the second EBM definition created a sort of loophole for clinicians. It expanded thescope of physician autonomy, in the hopes of responding to the concerns raised in medicaldebates about the cookbook nature of the original formulation. While these concessions werepermitted, the hierarchy remained consistent throughout the various formulations of EBM. As aresult, we are now in a position in which physicians who adhere strictly to the evidence hierarchymay end up over-prescribing pills as treatment for diseases rather than offering less invasive andoften safer lifestyle interventions. On the other hand, if physicians rely on the \"conscientious andjudicious\" interpretation of evidence, they will have a much wider range of options for treatment,more in line with the full array or network of evidence that is produced from a variety of sourcesand on a variety of research questions. But this looks peculiar. Rather than admitting the flaws 48 Orlistat (Xenical), for example, is the latest in pharmaceutical drugs designed to 'treat' obesity in spite of decadesof observational evidence demonstrating the value of exercise and dietary changes. For extensive criticism of thisand other lifestyle drugs see the consumer watchdog Public Citizen's website at: www.worstpills.org.178of the evidence hierarchy, advocates have kept it intact and offered loopholes to those physicianswho feel the need to deviate from the dictates of best evidence. But this places far too muchweight on the terms conscientious and judicious. These terms in the description of EBM save itfrom absurd conclusions (such as that the best treatment for obesity is generally a pharmaceuticaldrug) by allowing physicians to use common sense in the treatment of disease. But, from atheoretical standpoint, even with the addition of these loophole terms the evidence hierarchy isclearly not doing the task EBM proponents claim it is doing. It is not possible to identify theideal method for all medical questions about treatment without inappropriately neglecting sometreatments and treatment questions.Making judgements about the care of individual patients on the basis of RCTs alone maycontribute to overmedication simply because pharmaceutical drugs are most easily amenable totesting in RCTs. The evidence produced by RCTs is not always (or even usually) helpful atanswering social, economic, or environmental questions related to health. Observational studiesare better designed to answer these broader sorts of questions, and insofar as the EBM hierarchydownplays the value of these other sources of evidence, it seriously limits the scope of goodresearch and the corresponding scope of recommended treatments. This is especially unhelpfulwithin a holistic model of health. The social, economic, and environmental context of research isexplicitly factored out within the EBM model. Because naturopaths have a commitment tolooking closely at social, economic, and environmental factors when evaluating the health ofpatients, they are more aware of the dangers of the trend toward offering pharmaceutical drugs -or even standardized herbal remedies - for all medical conditions. However, there are reasonswhy all health professionals should be worried about this trend.7.2.1.1.1. Context-stripping (RCTs): What Gets MissedRuth Hubbard first introduced the idea of \"context stripping\" to describe the process of detachingobjects from the contexts in which they naturally occur in order to understand them.49 There is nodoubt that this can be a very effective way of examining certain features of a given object. Theproblem with this approach is that it means we are unable to understand the ways in which theobject normally functions in relation with other factors in its usual context. So we trade off 49 Hubbard, \"Science, Facts, and Feminism.\"179understanding one thing (how an object functions in relation to its usual context) for another (anunderstanding of the isolated object). Depending on whether we think there is any value in thefirst type of understanding, we might think twice about the assumption that context-stripping isalways the best way to gain knowledge. In light of their holistic principles, naturopaths areamong those who value the type of knowledge achieved by contextual investigations.We see the dangers of context-stripping in areas of science most closely connected totechnologies or practices. In medicine, for instance, we aim to understand the effects oftreatments as if the patient were not there - in a sense what we try to do is erase the individualpatient as much as possible so that we can get at data on the isolated treatment-effect pathway.There are many problems raised by this. First, because context does matter we end up withdifferent results in different patients, though we try to average these out in final calculations.Second, the treatment, once it is approved, will be given to patients and will have an even greatervariety of effects (since it is then applied to very different populations). Longino has writteninstructively about this effect in various domains of science:The failure to attend fully to the interactions of the social group, including its females, instudying the males of the species has led to distorted accounts of the structure of animalsocieties. In toxicity studies, the focus on a single chemical's toxic properties fails toinform us how its activities [are] modified, canceled or magnified by interaction withother elements in its natural environments. Focus on gene action has blinded us to theways in which the genes must be activated by other elements in the cell. These modelsmay well be empirically adequate in relation to data generated in laboratory experiments,but not in relation to potential data excluded by a particular experimental set-up.50Awareness of the effects of de-contextualization (or context-stripping) can do two things: it maysuggest that we not limit our investigations to those that are de-contextualized and it may suggestthat we need to work harder to ensure that when the results are used in practice thedecontextualization is made very clear, as are the implications of decontextualization.7.2.1.2. \"Support the Healing Power of the Body\"Naturopaths are committed to supporting the healing power of the body. This draws upon thenaturopathic belief in a vital force animating all living organisms. When CAM researchers play 50 Longino, \"In Search of Feminist Epistemology,\" 482.180by the rules of EBM, some individual alternative medical treatments will be proven efficacious.Treatments such as herbs (which resemble, and are testable like, drugs) are the best candidatesfor selective incorporation into mainstream medical care. This approach has also been referred toas the \"greening\" of mainstream medicine. Isolated alternative treatments are adopted bymainstream medicine while the underlying metaphysical view of health that originally producedthe treatments is discarded. So, for example, though mainstream medicine might adopt particularherbs (St. John's wort, ginseng, or garlic, for example), the naturopathic approach to health willlikely be left behind.51 Though there are many similarities between mainstream and naturopathicapproaches to health, including a first principle to \"do no harm\", there are differences. Themetaphysical account of health underpinning naturopathy emphasizes self-healing, highlyindividualized care, holism, vital force, and balance. This may be contrasted with the account ofhealth currently taking over mainstream medicine as a result of EBM.7.2.1.2.1. HealthNaturopaths raise concerns about the implicit, working definition of health adopted bymainstream evidence-based medical practitioners. This requires some background. In 1946 theWorld Health Organization (WHO) adopted the following definition of health: \"Health is a stateof complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease orinfirmity.\"52 The explicit recognition that health is not merely the absence of disease arose inresponse to widespread recognition that social and economic determinants of health (such aspoverty) are significant in contributing to the global burden of disease and should be recognizedand represented in any definition of health. Upon general acceptance, this new definition affectedthe structure of many international development plans developed in the decades to follow inwhich projects designed to provide adequate shelter, the basic elements of nutrition, and wellsfor clean drinking water in developing nations were seen as foundational to any health initiatives.This definition of health has not been amended since it was entered into force in 1948. After a 51 Similarly, while certain acupuncture points and procedures might be proven effective in RCTs and adopted intomainstream medicine, the underlying philosophy of traditional Chinese medicine, including the existence of the \"qi\"or vital force and the commitment to health as the balance of qi will be lost.52 World Health Organization.181half century of use and wide acceptance by the global medical community, this definition is agood one (though still, of course, open to revision).53 This all sounds good, from the perspective of naturopaths. However, there have beensome important changes in the past half century, notably those brought about by EBM. If younarrow the research agenda to focus on a small range of research questions (i.e. those that can bestudied in RCTs) and then require physicians to practice on the basis of this research, you areeffectively narrowing the scope of treatments offered by (compliant) physicians to patients.54 Asmedical practice becomes more evidence-based, physicians will increasingly prescribetreatments to patients on the basis of a restricted evidential base. At the end of the day, this hasimplications for patients because they are offered a limited range of treatments. In addition, it isdifficult for physicians to make operational the concept of health outlined by the WHO. Healthbecomes merely the state in which specific quantifiable symptoms or diseases are not present.How, after all, might a physician maintain a working commitment to the advancement of healthas well-being (and not merely the treatment of disease) while consistently failing to care forpatients with any environmental, psychological or socio-economic treatments and while payinglittle to no attention to the vast array of qualitative research designed to aid the physician incultivating understanding and empathy for the patient's subjective experience of illness?Evidence-based physicians have been constrained to adopt a narrow working definitionof health as a result of continued emphasis on a narrow scope of treatments. Medical care underthe EBM approach is not advancing health in the WHO sense. Wendy Rogers writes,EBM is a powerful influence upon the way we think about health and illness. Framinghealth problems in terms of the search for evidence of effective interventions tends tomaintain discussions of health within the narrow biomedical model, diverting attentionand resources away from alternative views.55 53 It would be possible to focus instead on a definition of health provided by, for instance, the Canadian MedicalAssociation, or the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario. I prefer the WHO definition because it seemsunlikely that any physician, anywhere in the world, would have a serious problem with it. I trade explicitcommitment to the definition for broader application of my arguments.54 This was discussed in Chapter Five. Also, the issue of compliance with evidence-based guidelines and standards isan interesting one. Many physicians do not comply with guidelines (hence the need for \"knowledge transfer\"initiatives and promotional work within hospitals). On this analysis, this resistance (however motivated) is at leastpartly a good thing (though, overall, it may still be bad) since it resists the narrowing of the scope of medicalpractice.55 Rogers, \"Evidence-based Medicine and Women,\" 69.182Naturopaths are consistently reminded, through their principles of practice, of the vast array ofcomplex human illnesses, which stem from sources as wide-ranging as the biological, social,economic, and environmental systems in which individuals are located, as well as thepsychological, emotional, spiritual and physical states of the individual over time. Whatevernarrow set of goals EBM might help us achieve, it is inappropriate as a tool for addressing all ofthese sources of illness and for providing targeted treatments for a wide range of diseases.Standards of evidence, wherever they are designed and employed, serve to shape thedirection of the field or discipline in which they are adopted. Standards of evidence thatinsufficiently recognize individual variation or which limit the type of question that can be askedin research to those which isolate simple, short-term relationships shape the understanding ofhealth in the systems to which they are applied. This, in turn, limits the scope of \"legitimate\"treatments. This philosophical gap will only continue to grow as each of the specializeddisciplines of mainstream medicine becomes more evidence-based. Acceptance of EBM willultimately require naturopaths to commit to a metaphysical view of health that does not fit withtheir own. We are currently (however slowly and covertly) in the process of adoptingincreasingly narrow definitions of knowledge and health in medicine, and naturopaths have asmuch reason as any one else to remain committed to their current metaphysical account of healthand to worry about the distorting impact of the adoption of EBM.7.2.2. No AssimilationThe sameness approach has significant shortcomings for naturopaths and for researchers andpractitioners in CAM more broadly. In particular, it leads to a decrease in attention to the sorts ofprinciples and practices just discussed. This contributes to a decrease in methodological andtheoretical diversity in medicine, which we know from CCE to be problematic. It is appealing,and no doubt tempting, for CAM researchers to play by the rules of EBM. It seems like an easyway to become scientific. However, if those rules are flawed, missing the chance to engage incritical debate about the merit of the rules and the ways they might be improved impoverishes allresearch. The diverse perspectives represented by CAM researchers will be lost if they choose toassimilate to EBM.1838. Building on Common Ground: Lessons and Future DirectionsAs noted earlier, alternative medical researchers are faced with three options. They can followaccepted EBM standards and design studies according to the demands of the evidence hierarchy(the sameness approach). Alternately, they can eschew these constraints in favor of studies thatare ranked much lower on the evidence hierarchy such as qualitative studies, cohort studies andcase studies (the difference approach). Finally, they can critically engage with the EBMstandards, argue for the value of lower-ranked methods, and devise new research designs thatmore closely reflect the needs and goals of alternative medical practitioners. CAM researchershave raised a number of serious concerns with the standards of EBM. These concerns providesupport for the suggestion that critically evaluating and re-conceptualizing EBM is not only themost reasonable and well-supported of the paths available to alternative researchers, but also thatit is critical to the integrity of mainstream medical research. Since several of the principles ofCAM research and practice are in tension with mainstream medicine, debate between the twoserves to highlight the background assumptions of each. This is good for everyone.In light of the arguments just presented, what CAM researchers might do is question thecurrent standard of evidence to which they are being held: the evidence hierarchy designed bythe EBM movement. Relevant questions would include, though by no means be limited to:Where did this standard of evidence come from? Is this standard best designed to answer allquestions of medical significance? What are the assumptions underlying this approach to medicalevidence? Does this epistemological view presuppose a particular metaphysical commitmentregarding the nature of health and disease? This permits CAM researchers to avoid assimilation,while retaining an appreciation for empirical evaluation.As we have seen in earlier chapters, many of the concerns with EBM encountered byCAM researchers are already fiercely debated within the conventional medical community. Theextraordinarily influential EBM movement has not only rewritten the standards of evidencerequired of physicians and researchers, it has also galvanized debate within the medicalcommunity on, among other topics, the role of clinical expertise and case-studies in medicineand the challenges of finding appropriate evidence to inform clinical decisions at the level of theindividual patient.184Concerns raised by alternative medicine that will likely resonate with mainstreamphysicians include the shift to physical/biological care at the expense of holistic care, theexclusion of social and environmental evidence from medicine through strict application of theevidence hierarchy, the devaluation of the patient in the decision-making process, the de-emphasis on qualitative evidence designed to help physicians understand the needs and values ofpatients, the lack of attention to pathophysiology and basic scientific research, and the narrowdefinition of health shaped by the evidence hierarchy. Several of these concerns have not so farbeen the focus of significant critical discussion among medical practitioners and researchers.Awareness of these critiques may provide conventional medical researchers with more reasons tojoin forces with alternative medical researchers and delve critically into the assumptions andtheoretical goals of EBM. One of the possible implications for alternative medical researchers ofchoosing the third, more critical option is that they will be involved in the development of newand better research methods and outcome measures.9. CAM Innovations and Use of Uncommon Methods, Outcome Measures, or AnalysisThere have been a number of innovations that have come about because of the specificchallenges faced by researchers in CAM. In addition, CAM research often draws attention tounderused clinical outcomes measures, methods of data analysis, research methods, andframeworks for research programs. Each of these innovations or uses could have an impact onresearch in mainstream medicine. I will highlight a few innovations and a few of the underusedmethods CAM researchers make use of in order to illustrate the value of diverse perspectives inmedical research.9.1. Whole Systems ResearchA group of international scholars have developed a framework for research into CAM therapiescalled Whole Systems Research (WSR).56 This framework was created to address the specificneeds of researchers investigating whole systems approaches to health. Whole systems 56 Verhoef et al., \"Complementary and alternative medicine whole systems research: Beyond identification ofinadequacies of the RCT.\"185approaches have three main characteristics: a unique theory of health and disease, complexinterventions involving multiple modalities and combined effects, and highly individualizedtreatments. Naturopathic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, ayurveda and homeopathy areall whole systems according to this definition. Naturopaths, as we have seen, subscribe to atheory of health and disease that emphasizes the self-healing powers of the body (the vital force),make use of as many as eight different modalities in the treatment of patients, believe thatinterventions have collective effects beyond their individual effects, and offer highlyindividualized treatments (often involving repeated consultations over long time periods).Traditionally, medical research has been directed at the evaluation of specific components ofwhole systems approaches, such as particular herbs or styles of massage. While this research isuseful at answering questions about the efficacy of particular treatments in isolation, it does notoffer any sense of the effectiveness of such treatments as they are used in conjunction with othertreatments, and within the context of a strong practitioner-patient relationship.57 As such, theseresults fail to investigate the sorts of questions that matter to CAM practitioners and theirpatients. There is a practical interest expressed by CAM practitioners and patients in whethersomething works in practice, above and beyond any questions about specific efficacy. Thesewhole systems questions, argue proponents, are worthy of investigation in their own right. Thisin no way implies that research into particular components is unnecessary, only that it isinsufficient.The proposed framework for research into whole systems \"targets the study of complexCAM therapies as system-level phenomena, as opposed to single-agent or uni-dimensionaleffects.\"58 In other words, whole systems research takes seriously the need for evaluation of theeffectiveness of whole systems rather than insisting only on research that reduces the evaluationof whole systems to their component parts. It recognizes the commitment of CAM practitionersto the inseparability of individual components of health care, the importance of the practitioner-patient relationship, and the context-specificity of results. In short, it recognizes theshortcomings of context-stripping in research, and values contextual research. Whole systemsresearch (WSR) is designed to contribute to research on the effectiveness of whole systemsapproaches to health. 57 Recall that efficacy indicates how well a treatment works in idealized settings while effectiveness indicates howwell a treatment works in regular practice, with typical patients.58 Ritenbaugh et al., \"Whole systems research,\" 32.186The aim of WSR is to use appropriate research designs and methods so that all aspects ofany internally consistent approach to treatment, or a whole system, can be assessedwithin its unique explanatory model.59The novel contribution of the WSR approach is its emphasis on model validity. Medicalresearchers have traditionally recognized the importance of the internal validity (or efficacy) andexternal validity (or effectiveness) of the results of research. Model validity refers to two furtherelements: 1) the fit between the research method and the theory of health and disease underlyingthe therapeutic intervention under investigation 2) the fit between the research method and thestandard therapeutic context. Internal, external, and model validity are all interrelated, but modelvalidity is often taken for granted. Mainstream medical researchers tend to presuppose theoriesof health and disease that are mechanistic and reductionistic: researchers aim to isolate causesand effects along physiological pathways. As a result, research methodologies, such as the RCT,have been developed in order to aid in the careful isolation of causal relationships betweentreatments and their pre-specified effects. WSR advocates do not argue that such research isflawed. What they aim to do is draw attention to the ways in which assumptions about health anddisease and the best way to understand phenomena fit with certain research methodologies moreso than with others.Researchers in mainstream medicine have been able to ignore issues of model validitybecause they share the same assumptions about the nature of health and the physician-patientrelationship. CAM researchers - particularly those researching whole systems approaches tohealth - encounter challenges when faced with standards of evidence that are incongruous withtheir theories of health and disease or methods of practice. So model validity is a generalcriterion for research, but is encountered as a particular problem primarily in CAM research.Model validity can be enhanced in a number of ways.9.1.1. Double ClassificationConsider the following case. A researcher is interested in evaluating the effectiveness oftraditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in patients with hypertension. She proposes an RCT which 59 Verhoef et al., \"Complementary and alternative medicine whole systems research,\" 207.187enrolls patients with high blood pressure and then divides them into groups receiving TCM andstandard mainstream care. Results indicate whether, as a group, the patients receiving TCM didbetter or worse than those receiving standard care. The problem with this trial is not just that itfails to be representative of the context of medical practice and thus has weak external validity (ashortcoming common to RCTs) but that it actively misrepresents TCM and, as a result, fails toevaluate anything meaningful at all. Such a trial has very weak model validity. It ignores thecommitment to individualized care at the core of TCM practice and lumps together patientsunder mainstream medical diagnoses that would not have been grouped together under TCMdiagnoses. According to TCM, a mainstream medical diagnosis of hypertension might beanything from \"rebellious qi in the liver and stomach\" to \"blood (yin) deficiency\" to \"liver andkidney yin deficiency\" depending on the particular individual.60 From the perspective of a TCMpractitioner, then, there is no homogeneity - no common condition - that brings these particulartrial participants together. This problem is compounded when TCM practitioners are asked toproduce \"the treatment\" for hypertension, so that it can then be standardized and given to allpatients in the TCM treatment group. At this point, inappropriate diagnosis has beencompounded with treatments that no TCM practitioner would necessarily offer to the particulartrial participants. While this second problem can be avoided by offering individualized TCMtreatments within the TCM group, the first problem endures. At the end of the trial, the resultsare meant to provide an indication of the efficacy of TCM for patients suffering fromhypertension. This is not necessarily a meaningful question from the perspective of the TCMpractitioner for the reasons just outlined.In order to address this problem, advocates of WSR have suggested that research subjectsin these sorts of trials should be diagnosed by mainstream medical physicians as well aspractitioners from the whole system under investigation.61 This double classification then leads tocomplex multiple-stream trail designs, and in turn greater model validity. It also makes the trialvery difficult and the statistical analysis challenging. However, the ability to ask and answerquestions of value to both TCM and mainstream researchers makes these double-classificationschemes useful and popular. 60 These diagnoses do not refer to physiological organs (kidney, spleen) but to qi meridians that have nophysiological corollary. Possible diagnoses from: Maclean and Lyttleton, Clinical Handbook of Internal MedicineVolume 1.61 Double classification was originally proposed by Fisher and colleagues in their article, \"Effect of homoeopathictreatment on fibrositis (primary fibromyalgia).\"1889.1.2. Variations of the RCTCAM researchers have drawn attention to neglected or unpopular variations of the RCT. I willdiscuss some of these below.9.1.2.1. Pragmatic TrialsPragmatic RCTs provide results that can be used immediately in practice. Rather than evaluatingthe efficacy of a treatment under ideal conditions, such trials evaluate the effectiveness of atreatment under usual conditions. Pragmatic RCTs are gaining popularity in both mainstream andalternative medical communities. Traditionally, RCTs have been designed to ensure the internalvalidity of results, but this has been secured at the expense of external validity. This is a result ofthe trade-off between specificity and generality (or accuracy and scope) of claims. This is mostoften achieved by using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria for trial participants. As a result,trial participants often differ significantly from those who later receive the treatment from theirphysician or practitioner. The more homogenous the research group, the more researchers canaim for internal validity. However, it is external validity that matters most to physicians andpractitioner, who must determine whether the results of an RCT can be applied to the case of aparticular patient.Pragmatic trials take care to represent \"real world\" patients, diseases, and health-caresettings. Heterogenous groups of patients are more common in these trials, and as a result trialparticipants more closely resemble the target treatment group in the greater population. So, forinstance, if the treatment is targeted to elderly women, then it is elderly women on whom it istested, even if that means including patients with comorbid conditions. Care is taken to minimizethe exclusion criteria for the trial. Pragmatic trials also mimic the complexity of regular patientcare by allowing a greater degree of flexibility in offered treatments. In the evaluation ofnaturopathy, for instance, a pragmatic trial would allow different naturopaths to make use ofdifferent modalities in treatment depending on their assessment of the individual needs of thepatient. So while one patient might receive acupuncture, the next might receive mostlynutritional treatment. This more closely reflects what would happen in practice, and allows189researchers to acknowledge their interest in answering the more pragmatic question. Thepragmatic RCT allows for black box evaluation, in that there is flexibility in the precisetreatment offered - within certain limits. Some proponents have also argued that the shift awayfrom placebo-controlled trials to standard care controls is an innovation of the pragmatic trial.629.1.2.2. Factorial TrialsFactorial designs \"compare single modalities to a combination of modalities to allow for theassessment of multiple interaction effects between treatments.\"63 Such trials have multipletreatment groups, each with different combinations of treatments. It is still possible to isolate theeffectiveness of particular treatments when compared with other combinations. For instance, inthe U.K. back pain exercise and manipulation (BEAM) trial patients received standard care plusone of the following: \"(1) an exercise program; (2) manipulation; or (3) manipulation followedby exercise.\"64 This allowed researchers to compare manipulation and exercise to each other,and, significantly for CAM researchers, to examine the potential cumulative effects of the twotreatments against each one isolated from the other. The ability of this method to isolate data onefficacy, while also investigating cumulative effects of many interventions, makes it well suitedto upholding model validity and therefore appealing to CAM researchers.9.1.2.3. Preference TrialsIn a preference RCT patients are asked whether they have a preference for one of the treatmentsoffered in an arm of the trial and if they have a preference they are assigned to that group. If theydo not, they are randomized as usual. This allows for analysis of randomized patients as usual,but also for analysis of the efficacy of different treatments by those who chose their treatment,and analysis of the efficacy of a specific treatment in those randomized to it compared with thosewho chose it. Patients who seek out CAM therapies often have strong opinions about which 62 For an overview of pragmatic RCTs with examples from psychiatry, see Hotopf, M. \"The Pragmatic RandomisedControlled Trial.\" Advances in Psychiatric Treatment 8 (2002): 326-33. For descriptions of pragmatic RCTs onacupuncture for two conditions (migraine and chronic low back pain) see MacPherson, H. \"Out of the laboratory andinto the clinic: acupuncture research in the real world.\" Clinical Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine 1 (2000): 97-100.63 Verhoef et al., \"Complementary and alternative medicine whole systems research,\" 208.64 Ibid.; UK BEAM Trial Team, 1377.190medical treatments they receive.65 As a result, they are more likely to opt out of RCTs when theyare informed of the chance that they will not receive the treatment they want. This type of designallows researchers to keep such patients in the trials. Because CAM practitioners often have adeep commitment to patient-centered care and patient choice, this design is also a better fit fromtheir perspective since it is more respectful of patient preferences.9.1.2.4. N-of-1 TrialsRCTs produce data that is averaged over the patients in the trial. Physicians and practitionersencounter individual patients. The gap between the average patient (after inclusion and exclusioncriteria) and the individual patient is a significant one, and is the first thing critics of RCTsmention when listing the problems with the RCT. The data produced by a n-of-1 trial is highlyindividualized and as such is particularly well-suited to the evaluation of CAM interventions. Italso represents an improvement over case-studies as the individualized method of choice forevaluating CAM interventions.66 The n-of-1 is most useful in cases where the condition ispersistent and stable, and the patient is highly motivated. These are quite often the health statusand characteristics of CAM patients, who tend to have chronic health problems and have takenthe initiative to seek out CAM care (often at their own expense).67 The gains made inindividualizing data in the n-of-1 trials are arguably lost in generalizability, but that may be aprice CAM researchers and practitioners are willing to pay. Also, in light of argumentssuggesting that traditional RCTs are not that generalizable either, this may just be a case ofrecognizing a generalizability problem in medical research (which could just turn out to be afunction of the type of research it is and the types of idiosyncractic, complex and social subjectsit necessarily investigates). Finally, the results of individual n-of-1 trials can be brought togetherand meta-analyzed if more generalizable data is desired (though this may suffer from the sameproblems meta-analyses tend to suffer from).68 65 Fitter and Thomas, \"Evaluating complementary therapies for use in the National Health Service.\"66 Johnston and Mills, \"N-of-1 Randomized Controlled Trials.\"67 Astin.68 Institute of Medicine, Committee on the Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine by the AmericanPublic, Board on Population Health and Public Health Practice, 108-28.1919.1.3. Appropriate Outcome Measures: MYMOP69CAM researchers have developed a new outcome measure for research and practice. TheMeasure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP) was developed by U.K. medicalresearcher Charlotte Paterson and first presented to the medical community in the BritishMedical Journal (BMJ) in 1996.70 As the name indicates, the questionnaire is designed to trackchanges in outcomes that matter to patients. This is in contrast with outcomes questionnaires thatpresuppose the concerns identified as most important by physicians or that are based on presetquality of life indicators. Patients initially record one or two symptoms that concern them most(usually the main reasons they are seeking help) and one activity of daily living that has beenrestricted by these symptoms. They assign a value to these concerns on a seven point scale,where seven is \"as good as it could be\"/\"able to do it normally\". They also respond to onequestion about their overall well-being. Later, the patients complete follow-up questionnaires inwhich the original concerns are retained and they assign new values on the seven-point scale.There is also an opportunity at this stage for patients to add one new concern and rate it. Thequestionnaire measures improvement or deterioration in the concerns identified by patients.Originally designed as a tool for primary care, the questionnaire is also well suited to be used asan outcomes measure in research. The questionnaire has been validated according to standardvalidation measures.71Paterson's BMJ article is written in a way that downplays the connection between thedevelopment of the MYMOP and CAM. In spite of appearances, and though Paterson is trainedas a medical doctor, she has a long affiliation with the CAM community and makes use ofcomplementary therapies in her practice. It is this appreciation for CAM and frustration withusual objective outcome measures (such as the SF-36) that motivated Paterson to create theMYMOP questionnaire. Quality of life measures are relatively crude and often fail to capturechanges that are important patients. As Paterson puts it, in a response to a critique of her article,how else might a practitioner capture the patient's concern with a symptom described as \"a 69 The most recent version of the MYMOP questionnaire, along with guidelines and advice, is available to the publicat http://www.bristol.ac.uk/hsrc/research/other/mymop/index.html.70 Paterson, \"Measuring outcomes in primary care.\"71 For details on the validation process see the Paterson article (Ibid.).192feeling of water gushing over the head\" or \"a burning sickness\"?72 Functional outcomes such asthe ability to return to work can also be highlighted by the patient. The questionnaire was createdin order to improve the ability of practitioners to measure changes in patient-centered outcomesand to improve patient-centered care. The principles of patient-centered care are foundational tomost CAM practices.In the original BMJ article Paterson included one section specifically on CAM. In it, shewrote, \"In the evaluation of complementary therapies a patient generated measure may overcomethe problem of the different diagnostic frameworks of different disciplines.\"73 The questionnairewill be helpful in cases where, for instance, diagnostic differences exist between traditionalChinese medicine (TCM) and mainstream medicine (as discussed above). Researchers can usethe MYMOP questionnaire to bypass some of these differences. As Paterson points out, this hasimplications for mainstream medicine as well, since physicians often disagree about appropriatediagnoses.74 Because the questionnaire allows patients to identify their most significant concerns,it sets outcomes independent of particular diagnoses.75 In addition, the inclusion of CAMpractitioners in the validation of the questionnaire and extensive use of MYMOP questionnaireswithin the CAM community since it has been made available, as well as the development ofmore recent variations including the Measure Yourself Concerns and Wellbeing (MYCaW)questionnaire developed specifically for complementary cancer therapies provide someindication of the ways in which CAM research has shaped the development and evolution of theMYMOP questionnaire.76 Finally, in the management of chronic conditions, the primaryconcerns are with the alleviation of symptoms and prevention of (further) diseases. CAM 72 Paterson, \"Author's Reply,\" 627.73 Paterson, \"Measuring outcomes in primary care,\" n.p.74 Paterson cites a study on the differences in diagnosis found among general practitioners dealing with upperrespiratory illnesses: Howie, \"Research in general practice.\"75 There are, of course, potential problems with such a measure, including the possibility that patients are radicallymistaken about what they should be most concerned about. Imagine, for instance, a patient who is most concernedwith her acne when she is dying of pancreatic cancer and has only a few weeks to live. Patients are not always thebest judge of outcomes that matter to their health. At the same time, it is precisely this shift to patient-centeredoutcomes and measures that, for better or worse, has become the new ideology of medical care (at least in Canada).Insofar as this is the case (I am not going to delve any further into this debate here), this questionnaire isundoubtedly useful. Another similarly useful outcome measure is the 'Goal Attainment Scaling' (GAS)questionnaire proposed by Becker et al. in their article \"Goal Attainment Scaling to Measure Individual Change inIntervention Studies.76 For further information on the MYCaW questionnaire see Paterson et al. \"Measure Yourself Concerns andWellbeing (MYCaW).\" The MYCaW questionnaire is publicly available athttp://www.bristol.ac.uk/hsrc/research/other/mymop/mycaw/index.html. For an example of the MYMOP used inCAM research see Chapman et al., \"A descriptive outcome study of 291 acupuncture patients.\"193therapies are frequently used by patients suffering from precisely these sorts of long-term,chronic illnesses. The emphasis on therapeutic regiments that seek to alleviate patient-definedconcerns seems particularly well-suited to chronic illnesses in which a cure is not possible.779.1.4. Data AnalysisSome of the tools of data analysis, borrowed from the social sciences, have also been suggestedas ways of getting at some of the individual patient data hidden within the results of RCTs. Thesemethods would include structural equation modeling, path analysis, and event stream analysis,and would help in identifying some of the individual reactions to treatments that often get lost inthe \"average patient\" data of RCTs. These analytic tools are of significant interest to CAMresearchers for many of the reasons already outlined.9.1.5. Observational ResearchRCTs are notoriously short. The average RCT is 6 weeks long. While it is possible, in principle,to carry out RCTs for long periods of time it is prohibitively expensive. As a result, it tends to beobservational studies that investigate treatments over longer periods of time (years and evendecades). Because the success of modern (mainstream) medicine has largely come about in acutecare, CAM practitioners quite often end up with patients who have chronic problems, from backpain to asthma to chronic fatigue. It is the long-term observational research that is more likely toget at information about how patients with chronic conditions do over a long period of time on aparticular intervention. There is a nice fit between CAM and observational research. Carefullydesigned, rigorous observational research should be a focus for CAM researchers.9.1.6. Qualitative ResearchCAM researchers are committed to mixed methods approaches and assign equal value toquantitative and qualitative research methods. CAM researchers argue that each set of methods 77 The Arizona Integrative Outcomes Scale is another example of an outcome measure developed by CAMresearchers. Bell et al., \"Development and validation of a new global well-being outcomes rating scale forintegrative medicine research.\"194helps us to understand certain aspects of complex interventions and we are best off when wehave as many different descriptions of phenomena as possible. It is also qualitative evidence that,as noted earlier, answers the 'why' questions about patient behavior. Because patient complianceis so important in CAM (since so many interventions, for example nutritional changes, must bemaintained and monitored by the patient over long periods of time) understanding the reasonswhy patients act the way they do is very important to CAM practitioners.10. Lessons from CAMThese sorts of innovations and defences of underused methods could be an importantcontribution to a shift in the conventional understanding of best evidence that accepts the needfor, and value of, rigorous testing in medicine without unduly and unnecessarily restricting thescope of evidence. The work being done in alternative medicine right now is not merelysomething to be dismissed as fringe science, but is an attempt to re-work the EBM hierarchy forthe benefit of patients in a way that is consistent with values underlying all of medical practice,broadly construed. This is a movement that all practitioners, whether alternative or mainstream,have good reason to welcome and encourage.New methodologies and approaches to solving problems can be invented at any time.These innovations are driven in part by the need for methodologies that can answer newquestions raised as science progresses and social contexts change. Given the ever-changingnature of the questions and problems encountered by scientists in a variety of fields, scientificcommunities should not limit their standards in such a way as to exclude the possibility that newand better methodologies might come along at any moment. Similarly, as the questions underinvestigation change over time, certain methodologies may come into fashion. For these reasons,the cognitive goals and practical ends of any community will not be met best by a staticcommitment to particular methodological approaches or regulatory standards, but rather by anopen-ended commitment to certain community standards.78Scientific communities are held together by shared community standards, and it is whenthese standards are met that regulatory standards can be designed. Regulatory standards are notstatic, but must be responsive to the changing cognitive needs and practical ends of the 78 The distinction between regulatory and community standards is offered in Chapter Two.195community. As we saw earlier, advocates of the EBM hierarchy require those outside themainstream medical research community to conform to existing regulatory standards. It mighthave appeared, unreflectively, as though these regulatory standards provide boundary conditionson who should have a voice in the medical research community. However, if regulatorystandards are imposed on others, diversity is compromised. Stabilizing scientific inquiry in thisway demonstrates a dogmatic commitment to particular goals and ends, and a belief that one hasidentified the important questions that need to be answered within a domain. Those who haveother questions, or other goals/ends, are seen as deviant rather than as presenting an opportunityfor change. But, as we saw in Chapter Two, CCE does not suggest that regulatory standards canbe imposed on communities. In order for outsiders to be included in a community debate, theremust be some overlap in community standards (shared public standards) and the domain ofinvestigation.What this analysis demonstrates is the inadequacy of a response to CAM which simplyrequires that CAM researchers completely assimilate and adopt all community and regulatorystandards set by the mainstream. It is not necessary, as we saw in Chapter Two, for members ofnon-mainstream communities to share all standards with mainstream communities if they hope tohave a voice in critical debates. The requirement is, rather, that they share at least one of thecommunity standards, which in turn follows from a common cognitive goal or practical endwithin a shared domain. A clear commitment to empirical adequacy serves as this point ofoverlap between at least some CAM research communities and the mainstream medicalcommunity. In what follows, I consider one likely criticism of my argument thus far. Thiscritique arises out of a tension between the requirement to cultivate diverse perspectives and theneed to maintain rigorous standards for medical research.11. Critical AnalysisTo sum up: diversity is good for medical inquiry because it contributes to the objectivity ofmedical research. EBM suppresses diverse research methodologies through the evidencehierarchy, and widespread social acceptance of EBM has led to increased pressure on researchersfrom a variety of theoretical backgrounds to assimilate into the EBM model. Based on the196arguments offered in Chapter Two, we have good reason to consider the negative implications ofthis decrease in diversity for the future of medical research.11.1. ObjectionOne anticipated concern with this argument stems from the recognition that science proceeds notonly through the advancement of new ideas, but also by slowly and tediously working out thedetails of accepted theories through experimentation. How, if we become too interested incultivating diversity, are we going to avoid endless testing and retesting, endless new proposalsand endless new ideas?79 Progress seems to require some sort of balance between what Longinoidentifies loosely as the two missions of science. These are: the knowledge-extending mission,which involves the construction of comprehensive accounts of the natural world throughpiecemeal puzzle-solving and the gradual extension of theories to new data, and the criticalmission which aims at an accurate (or true) description of the world through extensive testing, re-testing, rejecting and reformulating of hypotheses.80 If we allow a great number of diverseperspectives in science we will spend all of our time testing and rejecting new hypotheses insteadof advancing and perfecting already established theories.11.2. ReplyI suggest that the EBM hierarchy is a straightforward instantiation of the knowledge-extendingmission of science. Longino describes what happens when scientific inquiry tends more towardthis sort of conservative approach and subordinates concerns with its critical mission. I willquote her description at length:The systematic and unifying treatment of phenomena enables us to interact with thenatural world with reliable expectations. A methodology that legitimizes the stabilizationof inquiry thus serves some constitutive ends of knowledge seeking. It must also,however, subordinate science's critical function in order to avoid the endless testing andconstant generation of new explanatory frameworks that would subvert knowledgeextension, and it must disguise that subordination to deflect the accusation that the 79 Longino, Science as Social Knowledge, 223.80 Ibid., 32-34.197sciences are not after all concerned with truth. One way to achieve this disguise isthrough the adoption of an account that minimizes the need for and role of criticismbeyond hypothesis testing, that is, by an account that can render invisible the role ofbackground assumptions.81This describes the progress of the EBM movement with surprising accuracy. EBM was createdas an anti-authoritarian, even liberatory, movement. Proponents of the earliest version of EBMexplicitly called for the need to supplant tradition and authority, and interject objective evidencein its place.82 The EBM approach is positioned as a critical approach that emphasizes active,engaged critical thinking. But this is not the practice - at least as represented in medical journals- as the structure of EBM means that critical debate tends to be restricted to asking how sourcesof evidence such as intuition and experience can be fit into the evidence hierarchy or added on tothe results of the hierarchy. Questions about the assumptions underlying the hierarchy itself arerarely seriously engaged.83 According to Longino, emphasis on the conservative, knowledge-extending mission of science \"requires that its critical mission be blocked.\"84 Overemphasis onthe knowledge-extending mission of science often \"discourages the investigation of alternativeframeworks.\"85 In fact, \"those who might otherwise be inclined to do so [investigate alternativeframeworks], in the spirit of free inquiry, are dissuaded by a combination of related phenomena:from the desire to be a 'good', effectively orthodox scientist to the lack of attention accorded tononmainstream ideas.\"86 I hope to have demonstrated the ways in which EBM is doing just this.87Those who are concerned that encouraging the cultivation of diverse perspectives willstall the production of good research and waste time and resources are right to point out the needfor balance in the two missions of science. An overemphasis on diversity is not beneficial toscientific inquiry. Of course, a diminished emphasis on diversity is similarly bad for scientific 81 Ibid., 224.82 Interestingly, commentators have noted that EBM has led to the creation of new forms of authority (Cochranecollaborations, guidelines, and the evidence hierarchy) and is now most often identified as an approach thatpreserves, rather than overturns, the status quo.83 Notable exceptions to this trend do exist. See in particular the work by Upshur, Tonelli and Tanenbaum, andpublications in the annual issue of the Journal of Clinical Evaluation dedicated to critiques of EBM.84 Longino, Science as Social Knowledge, 223.85 Ibid., 225.86 Ibid..87 As an interesting side note, Longino also points out the ways in which emphasis on the knowledge-extendingmission of science serves to shore up the professional boundaries of particular scientific communities: \"struggles toexclude would-be scientists from the professional scientific community...are, among other things, battles to reducethe number of formative assumptions, thus stabilizing the object of inquiry and enabling the development of theoryunder a unifying or unified and eventually transparent set of values.\"87198inquiry. I hope to have offered some reason to believe that the danger in medicine is notcurrently one of embracing too much diversity. In addition to my arguments on this point, formereditor of the New England Journal of Medicine, Marcia Angell, has argued that, at least in NorthAmerica, medical research is plagued by a lack of innovation, medical practice is circumscribedby strict rules and guidelines and available medical therapies exhibit an increasingly narrowfocus on acute conditions and pharmaceutical treatments.88 The trend in each of these areas is oneaway from diversity. If EBM and other social forces have shifted the balance of research in onedirection, research that stimulates a return to equilibrium can only benefit medicine. I suggestthat contemporary EBM proponents should be encouraged to take a more diversity-friendlystance, or at least to consider (and publicly debate) the need for such a stance. This might includea reconsideration of the central role of the evidence hierarchy in medical research and practice, areturn to the emphasis on critical discussion that was originally at the core of the EBM, theextension of this critical attitude EBM's own background assumptions, and a re-evaluation of thedemands made of non-mainstream researchers. This will not mean the rejection of empiricalstandards or dissolution of the boundaries between good and bad science.Medical researchers must maintain a commitment to knowledge extension and to criticalevaluation. I argue that the EBM movement has not been sensitive enough to the importance ofthis balancing act. Further, I suggest that the conservatism underlying the present imbalance hassignificant practical and philosophical implications. These implications warrant open discussionby the members of the medical community, broadly construed.12. NursingFinding common ground in the EBM debate is critical, given that, as Verhoef and colleaguesremind us, the issues raised apply also to complex interventions in mainstream medicine, such as\"multidisciplinary chronic care, patient-centred primary care, psychotherapy, and palliativecare.\"89 In fact, there is a great deal of common ground between the sorts of critiques of EBMmade in these other areas and those made in CAM contexts. I will mention a few of thecomments made by nurses as an example. Like CAM researchers and practitioners, nurses are 88 Angell, The Truth about the Drug Companies.89 Verhoef, et al. \"Complementary and alternative medicine whole systems research,\" 211.199under a great deal of pressure to provide evidence of the effectiveness of their interventions andcare. Recently, researchers writing on EBM have made the following claims:Currently, traditional practices retain a stronghold in nursing and health care. Unless theinitiative is taken to develop and search for evidence to uphold or refute these practices,nursing will not be in a position to answer, with confidence, questions about why, or if,these traditional practices ought to be maintained or changed.90It is imperative that the nursing profession continue to explore the philosophicalperspectives that underscore evidence-based practice and their implications for decision-making in nursing practice.91There are similarities between the sorts of challenges raised by CAM researchers and thoseraised by nurses. For instance, in order to prevent nursing from becoming dehumanized ordecontextualized, nurses suggest that qualitative research should complement quantitativeresearch. A clear emphasis on the context-specificity of nursing is said to be vital to connectingnursing research and practice.92 Critiques of EBM come from such diverse perspectives as: CAMresearchers, nurses, psychiatrists, palliative care specialists, surgeons, public health officers, andadministrators. While I have highlighted the concerns raised by CAM researchers, attention tothe diverse perspectives offered in each of these areas would only strengthen the critique ofEBM.I argue that diversity is critical to the advancement of knowledge in medicine. This isbecause communities expressing strong dissent from mainstream views are able to identify anddraw attention to methodological and theoretical assumptions underlying research programswithin the mainstream community. One advantage of this enforced self-reflection is that itenables members of both mainstream and alternative communities to correct flaws in theirsystemic assumptions. In addition, it promotes greater understanding of the epistemologicalfoundations of standards of good evidence and requires that researchers justify such standardsagainst alternatives. Unfortunately, as I demonstrate in the above, the recent EBM movementconstrains the cultivation of diversity in medical research. It does so by suppressing diverseresearch methodologies through the evidence hierarchy, and by increasing the external socialpressure to adhere to these standards. I argue that EBM advances the knowledge-extending 90 Romyn et al., 187.91 Ibid., 184.92 Ibid., 184-8.200mission of medical research at the expense of the critical mission, and suggest that thisimbalance is dangerous. Attention to the ways in which EBM suppresses diversity will contributeto a more appropriate balance for medical research.13. SummaryIn light of the epistemological arguments for diversity provided by CCE and the ways in whichEBM suppresses methodological and theoretical diversity, there are good reasons to beconcerned about the EBM movement. Further, attention to diverse methodologies and theoreticalframeworks can be helpful in exposing the background assumptions of mainstream research.This is a significant accomplishment according to the CCE approach to knowledge-production. Itwould be astonishing to find that the standards currently adopted by mainstream medicine areperfect, and that we can incorporate entirely different systems of healing into the mainstreamsystem without having to make any changes or modifications, especially given the immaturestate of our current standards (EBM is just 15 years old, after all). If alternative medicalresearchers concede to the demands of the EBM hierarchy and mainstream medicine slowlyintegrates elements of alternative medicine into common practice, there may not be any changeto the current hierarchy. That would be a shame, because as I hope to have established in thisdiscussion, there is significant common ground between the concerns with EBM raised byalternative medical researchers and those identified by mainstream medicine. When the diversecommunities of medical practitioners and researchers are all engaged in critical discussion weare in the best possible position to identify and create truly excellent standards of evidence.Conventional medical practitioners and researchers, and certainly patients, have much to gainfrom attention to diverse perspectives on health - and much to lose if alternative medicalresearchers submit uncritically to the hegemony of EBM.201Chapter SevenThe Future of Evidence-based Medicine:Interactive Objectivity and the Open Science MovementEvidence-based medicine aims to increase the objectivity of medical research and practice.Objectivity is regularly used to signify \"everything from empirical reliability to proceduralcorrectness to emotional detachment.\"1 It is not immediately evident what people mean whenthey speak about the objectivity of research results, outcomes, methodologies and individuals -particularly when they speak of these all in the same breath. Philosopher of science, HeatherDouglas, has recently identified eight distinct senses of objectivity in common use in the analyticphilosophical literature.2 In the first part of this chapter, I outline these senses of objectivity andexplain the strengths and weakness of each sense. Following this, I draw upon this carefulcatalogue in order to characterize the sense of objectivity underlying my version of criticalcontextual empiricism (CCE). I suggest that CCE upholds what Douglas calls interactiveobjectivity. CCE eschews any expectation that individuals remain detached or neutral in thecourse of inquiry. Instead CCE emphasizes the public nature of knowledge and identifiesfeatures of communities that contribute to the transformative criticism of proposed hypotheses.Thus, according to CCE, interactive objectivity is secured through discussion and debate within adiverse community.3In the latter sections of the chapter, I discuss the importance of these types of communitydiscussions for the standards of evidence proposed by EBM. I argue that there has been anoverriding fixation on procedural objectivity as a result of EBM. Drawing on Douglas' catalogueand the CCE account of interactive objectivity, I identify potential dangers with this fixation. Inparticular, I raise concerns about the inability of such an account to address the influence ofunidentified social values on medical research. According to CCE, however good proceduralobjectivity may be, it is not sufficient for robust objectivity. In this chapter, my aim is twofold.First, I aim to provide a comprehensive description of the CCE account of objectivity and relate 1 Daston and Galison, \"The Image of Objectivity,\" 82.2 Douglas, \"The Complexity of Objectivity,\" 453.3 The modified version of CCE outlined in Chapter Two specifies what is meant by diversity.202it to standard accounts of objectivity. Second, I aim to demonstrate, using the medical researchcontext, how and why this particular understanding of objectivity is valuable. In pursuing thissecond project, I provide arguments about the shortcomings of EBM and the ways in which themedical community can improve the interactive objectivity of their standards of evidence.Drawing on the modified CCE norms, I outline the sorts of interventions in medical research andpractice required by interactive objectivity, including: elimination of confidentiality agreementssigned by researchers, disclosure of competing interests in publications, prohibition on ghostauthorships, public registration of research, open peer review, open access to publications, opensubmission processes, increased public funding of research, less reliance on guidelines, greaterawareness of the collective nature of medical decisions and, most importantly, greater analytictraining for medical professionals. I argue that the narrow focus on procedural objectivitycurrently adopted in medicine must be expanded to include support for the social institutions thatenable conditions of interactive discussion and debate.1. A Short History of Objectivity in ScienceWithin contemporary analytic epistemology and philosophy of science a consensus on theappropriate way to define objectivity is, as Elizabeth Lloyd puts it, \"glaring in its absence.\"4 Shecontinues, \"[T]he emphasis on the limitations of objectivity, in specific guises and networks, hasbeen a continuing theme of contemporary analytic philosophy for the past few decades.\"5Contemporary epistemologists hold a wide variety of views on the nature of objectivity. ArthurFine has described the concept as a \"hodgepodge\" of ideas and ideals.6 If we are to talkintelligibly about the nature of objectivity, we must begin by acknowledging that objectivity is acomplex concept and that its definition has been disputed from a variety of metaphysical andepistemological perspectives throughout the history of its use. This is true even when we narrowour focus to the realm of science. As historians Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison point out, theconcept has evolved over time in response to the concerns of scientists in different time periods.According to Daston and Galison, we label something objective when it is opposed to that which 4 Lloyd, \"Objectivity and the Double Standard for Feminist Epistemologies,\" 373.5 Ibid., 375.6 Fine, \"The viewpoint of no one in particular,\" 14.203is considered the most dangerous form of subjectivity by people of the day.7 While scientiststhroughout history have endeavored to free inquiry from the negative influence of subjectivevalues, the perceived sources of those values have fluctuated over time.It is difficult to speak of the sciences broadly, since the history of specific sciences havefollowed very different paths, but Daston and Galison draw some general lessons from botanyabout the development of our current concept of objectivity. Their analysis begins in theeighteenth century, when scientists were primarily concerned with objects that were idiosyncraticand difficult to capture. In order to correct for this, there was an emphasis on the training andexpertise of scientists and the professional character of objectivity. The common belief was thatdisciplined geniuses or sages were needed to get at what is real in the unruly world because theyare able to see beyond mere appearance to the ideal form of objects. Thus, expert interpretationwas an integral part of objectivity. In the nineteenth century, concern arose about the innertemptations of scientists. The greatest obstacle to objectivity became the impure influence of thescientists on the objects of study. Thus, the focus was on heroic self-restraint and the personal(and individual) character of objectivity. Scientists were expected to remain pure and let naturespeak to them. In the nineteenth century, it was the scientist (not the world) that was unruly andin need of control.The early twentieth century marked a brief return to the celebration of unconscious skillsand interpretation with a renewed focus on expert judgement. In addition, when scientists in thetwentieth century realized that heroic self-restraint could not fully eliminate values, theirattention shifted to social procedures designed to eliminate these individual idiosyncrasies. So,according to Daston and Galison we see the rise of a strict scientific method in many areas ofscience, and though in some areas there may be a lingering commitment to interpretive expertise,this is largely overridden by adherence to ostensibly objective procedures. That is to say, we arecurrently concerned more with the unruly scientist than the unruly world. And we do not thinkthe unruly scientist has the self-restraint to deal with the problem on his or her own, so manyscientific communities have adopted rules and guidelines of practice for researchers in the hopesof constraining the ability of researchers to bias research. The concept of objectivity is complex 7 Daston and Galison, \"The Image of Objectivity.\"204and evolving, and though it is generally opposed to subjectivity, the perceived sources ofdangerous subjectivity have shifted over time.82. Catalogue of ObjectivityIn order to isolate the elements of objectivity that have received varying degrees of attentionfrom scientists over the years, I turn to the recent work of Heather Douglas. As mentioned above,Heather Douglas has identified eight distinct senses of objectivity in common use in thephilosophy of science.9 This catalogue will be the starting point for my investigation, as it helpsto disambiguate the various bundles and strands of objectivity in contemporary use. In the courseof putting this catalogue of objectivity together, Douglas avoided having her work overshadowedby the realism/anti-realism debate by focusing her analysis on the different sorts of objectivityinherent in knowledge-productive processes. Limiting discussion to objective processes allowsDouglas to avoid taking a position on whether the results of such processes are 'really real','reliably produced' or merely 'useful'. This focus on objective processes is especially well suitedto understanding feminist accounts generally because they tend to focus on practices andprocesses. In addition, the approach is prudent since epistemological accounts that relyextensively on metaphysical accounts are required to take on the onerous responsibility ofdefending both.10 This careful catalogue of senses of objectivity is significant because it helps usto identify common bundles of these senses adopted in various realms of science. Some of thesenses are more prevalent than others, and, as I will suggest, some might be better cataloguedwith a different family of terms. The catalogue is, nonetheless, a helpful starting point for ananalysis of objectivity. 8 As Ian Hacking eloquently puts it: \"Objectivity is not the less massive, impenetrable, resistant, because it is theproduct of our history. But when we get close enough to run our hands across the rock - or rather, conglomerate -we shall feel its fissures and notice how different is its texture from that smooth surface that we seem to observefrom afar, before we attend to the innumerable details that are its only origin and which constitute its substance.\"Hacking, \"Statistical Language, Statistical Truth and Statistical Reason,\" 155.9 Douglas, \"The Irreducible Complexity of Objectivity.\"10 Longino, Science as Social Knowledge. 17-19. See also Longino, The Fate of Knowledge, 140, where she writes\"The kind of social epistemology I advocate does not commit itself to any metaphysics of nature... [P]hilosophersmay use metaphysical assumptions implicitly in their development of a general epistemology. This is, as I haveargued, a flaw in such accounts, because it requires an argument for the metaphysics as part of the support of theepistemology.\"205Douglas groups the eight sense of objectivity into three modes according to the type ofprocesses they describe. They are:Objectivity1: Experimental Objectivity1The first two senses of objectivity are grouped together in one mode because they relate to theinteraction between the researcher and the natural world - the experimental process, broadlyspeaking.12 When scientists intervene in the world in predictable and repeatable ways or whenthey arrive at similar results from a variety of diverse attempts to capture the phenomena, theyare more likely to arrive at objective descriptions of the natural world. These are, respectively,the manipulable and convergent forms of objectivity identified by Douglas.13 I believe that theseand other methods for interacting successfully with the natural world are more often thought ofas specifications of the requirement of empiricism rather than as senses of objectivity. Theinteraction between a researcher and the natural world occurs because of a commitment toempiricism. The specific processes (methodologies, practices, interventions) which allow for thereliable, repeatable and predictable interaction with the natural world are important as conditionsfor empirical success, rather than for objectivity. And there are surely more than two of thesetypes of processes. It is worth noting that accounts of objectivity which fail to explicitly address 11 Douglas, \"The Irreducible Complexity of Objectivity,\" 455-65.12 I have called this first mode experimental rather than \"human-world interactive\" (Douglas' term) because I thinkit might otherwise be confused with interactive objectivity, which I discuss in great detail later in the chapter. Thecontent of the mode remains the same.13 Douglas, \"The Irreducible Complexity of Objectivity,\" 456-8.206experimental processes may still account for these features under commitments to empiricism.For these reasons, I will not spend much time discussing this mode of objectivity.2.2. Individual Objectivity2The second mode of objectivity concerns the process by which individuals think and reason.Requirements that scientists distance themselves from their personal values are often conflatedwith the more stringent requirement that scientists excise all values from their reasoning.Douglas makes an important distinction between these two different requirements when sheidentifies detached objectivity and value-free objectivity. While detached objectivity requires aprohibition on using values in the place of evidence, value-free objectivity requires that allvalues are forbidden in scientific reasoning. Thus, the requirement of detachment amounts to anexpectation that scientists not allow themselves to be led away from the results of empiricalinvestigations by their own personal values and biases, while the requirement that individualsseparate themselves from all individual values is much more demanding (perhaps impossibly so).A third sense of objectivity thought to be related to the individual reasoning process is value-neutral objectivity, which requires that scientists make an effort to exclude \"extremes\" of valuesfrom their reasoning. In order to be value-neutral, scientists are expected to gain an awareness ofthe range of values that relate to their reasoning and then find a centered, balanced position. Eachof these three senses of objectivity is distinct, and a normative philosophy of science will usuallyencode at least one of these individual processes for limiting values in science, depending onassumptions about the nature of reality and the relative importance of individual reasoning andsocial or community reasoning to the production of knowledge.2.3. Social Objectivity3The third mode of objectivity concerns social or community processes. The outcomes of socialprocesses are objective to the extent that they fulfill the requirements of one of the followingthree distinct senses of objectivity: procedural, concordant and interactive objectivity. I willdiscuss each of these senses in greater detail, since they form the basis for much of the discussionlater in the chapter.2072.3.1. Concordant ObjectivityWhen we attribute objectivity to the results of scientific investigations because those results havebeen agreed upon by a variety of independent investigators, we have in mind concordantobjectivity. In concordant objectivity, it is merely the agreement, and not the process that leads toagreement, that is relevant to the assessment of research. Polling researchers to see if they agreewith the conclusions of a particular study would be one way of establishing concordantobjectivity. Consensus conferences and traditional styles of creating guidelines in medicinewould fall under this categorization. The strength of this sense of objectivity is that it allowsscientific communities to bring the skills of a variety of scientists to bear on the results ofresearch, and utilizes their individual judgements on such research. This distributes the effect ofindividual values on the results of research and allows the scientific community to assign greaterobjectivity to research that is widely accepted (for whatever reasons). The principal danger ofthis sense of objectivity is the possibility of group illusions - particularly those based on sharedassumptions and theoretical frameworks. Wide agreement on research may indicate, for instance,that the range of theoretical frameworks being considered by scientists is very limited; that is, itmay simply indicate a high degree of homogeneity in the scientific community. And while thestrength of a particular theoretical framework may result in homogeneity, in practical termsnarrowing the scope of research and restricting admission to the scientific community couldachieve that same end. Silencing opposition and preventing dissenting views from beingconsidered will be tempting routes to concordant objectivity. I will refer to this as the restrictivetendency. Insofar as a community of scientists is unable to assess whether the restrictivetendency has been in play, concordant objectivity cannot prevent group illusions from undulyinfluencing assessments.14 Moreover, any attempts to qualify concordant objectivity by addingrequirements that group agreement be 'rationally achieved' or 'under conditions of pluralism'turns concordant objectivity into a version of interactive objectivity (discussed below).2.3.2. Procedural Objectivity 14 Ibid., 462-3.208Procedural objectivity - sometimes referred to as mechanical objectivity - is attributed to thedata produced by highly restrictive, and often quantified, rule-based procedures. In order toachieve objective results, we set up a procedure that leaves little or no room for input fromparticular individuals once it is implemented. Douglas gives the example of multiple-choiceexams, which are procedurally objective because, given the rigidity of the rules governing theprocess of assessing grades on these exams, any individual can take the place of the exam graderand come up with the same result. This means that individuals using this procedure areinterchangeable, and thus that idiosyncratic individual values will not normally impact the resultsof such a procedure. The strength of this sense of objectivity is that it uses a weakly socialmechanism to eliminate individual values. Of course, this comes at a price, notably therestriction of the scope of knowledge to that which can be produced by such rigid proceduresand, perhaps more insidiously, the imbedding of values into the design of the procedure in thefirst place.Reliance on such procedures has historically garnered trust from the public. Just asnumbers are often used to project certainty and confidence, procedurally objective results - oftenquantified - can be touted as 'fact' more easily than the rulings made on the basis of expertise.Theodore Porter suggests that the shift to procedural objectivity is often driven by a desire tosecure the trust of others and to encourage the belief that subjectivity has been conquered, onceand for all. Procedural objectivity relies on the implementation of a number of rules. \"Rules are acheck on subjectivity: they should make it impossible for personal biases or preferences to affectthe outcome of an investigation.\"15 Ultimately, since the individual perspectives are thought tohave been expunged, \"objectivity means the rule of law, not men.\"162.3.3. Interactive ObjectivityInteractive objectivity is secured through discussion and debate within a community. Theassumption behind this sense of objectivity is that the diverse perspectives of a variety ofresearchers can, under conditions of free and open debate, produce data that is as free fromidiosyncratic individual values as possible. This relies on a Millian characterization of the 15 Porter, Trust in Numbers: The pursuit of objectivity in science and public life, 4.16 Ibid., 74.209benefits of open discussions (free speech), according to which we get at truth by subjecting ideasto the scrutiny of as many different perspectives as possible.17 This facilitates the discovery andcorrection of errors and falsehoods and greater understanding of the reasons behind well-accepted beliefs. Not only does the procedure of interactive discussion minimize the impact ofindividual values on research, if it is interpreted broadly it may also ensure that social values areminimized. This is because critical discussion proceeds on all aspects of research and is notlimited to assessment of the results of research. Thus, the values and assumptions underlying thedesign of research from the earliest stages can be subjected to critique. If this is achieved,interactive objectivity appears to have a significant advantage over the two other senses of socialobjectivity3, neither of which is able to acknowledge, much less address, the influence of socialvalues on inquiry. Interactive objectivity is also distinct from procedural objectivity in its focuson community-level processes, as opposed to the processes or methods of particular researchprojects. Certain structural features of communities may be identified as key to creating theconditions conducive to such interactive discussion.18Like concordant objectivity, interactive objectivity can be compromised when membersgive in to the restrictive tendency and, influenced by various practical pressures, eliminatedissenting voices from their debates. It is often easier to discuss the merits of some piece ofresearch when the individuals involved in the discussion all share a theoretical framework,background assumptions and commitment to shared cognitive goals and practical ends. Insofaras diverse perspectives make interactive debate and discussion more difficult, and agreement lesslikely, there will always be some motivation to place restrictions on the scope of the communityand to minimize the scope of investigation. Thus, advocates of this sense of objectivity need topropose a mechanism for preserving diverse perspectives in order to ensure the critical debate isgenuine. Without this mechanism, the restrictive tendency driven by a desire to make the debateproceed efficiently may undermine the benefits thought to accrue from interactive objectivity. Ifwe are unable to tell whether a particular scientific community has fallen prey to the restrictivetendency, we will not know whether there is an unreflective, shared assumption or frameworkinfluencing research and as a result we will be unable to argue that interactive objectivity ismanaging (as best possible) the influence of social values on research. Thus, if the possibility for 17 The Millian framework is discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two.18 Examples of such features were given in Chapter One.210the restrictive tendency to take hold is not addressed, interactive objectivity achieves no morethan concordant or procedural objectivity. If it is, however, interactive objectivity has a greatdeal of appeal.3. CCE Account of ObjectivityI turn now to an evaluation of objectivity in critical contextual empiricism.3.1. Experimental Objectivity1CCE focuses on the need to control the influence of idiosyncratic preferences, biases,assumptions, interests and values, whether they are individual or social. CCE does not attributeany type of objectivity to the processes used by researchers to interact with the natural world.Rather, \"[O]bjectivity is analyzed as a function of community practices rather than as an attitudeof individual researchers towards their material or a relation between representation andrepresented.\"19 This extends to methods used by researchers to obtain data about the naturalworld. Recall that CCE does contain a strong commitment to empirical adequacy (the\"empiricism\" part of CCE), the criteria for which overlap to a great degree with the requirementsof manipulable and convergent objectivity suggested by Douglas. CCE is committed toempiricism, though Longino does not specify the details of the experimental interactions that willresult in the most accurate empirical results, nor does she discuss empiricism as a condition of, ormode of, objectivity.3.2. Individual Objectivity2According to the requirements of detached objectivity, scientists should ensure that theirpersonal values do not usurp empirical evidence. CCE retains some commitment to this sense ofobjectivity. Again, though, it does so as part of its commitment to empiricism, not as part of theaccount of objectivity. And I think this is right: it is a commitment of empiricism that scientistsnot override empirical evidence with values. To call this commitment to empiricism detachment 19 Longino, Science as Social Knowledge, 216. Emphasis added.211is misleading, since it suggests that scientists are capable of splitting themselves into differentselves, the scientist version of which is detached from person values (the slide to value-freeobjectivity here is a quick and easy one). Further, it suggests that the practice of science can beseparated from any and all values through the will-power of individuals. Longino explicitlyrejects these additional commitments when she defends CCE, but it is worth noting that hercommitment to empiricism covers this sense of objectivity as it has been defined by Douglas. Asone might expect, given that her account is called critical contextual empiricism, she is notinterested in having scientists reject empirically adequate data because of values. But she is alsonot interested in taking any further step toward value-free objectivity.In fact, Longino explicitly rejects value-free objectivity:The objectivity of individuals in this scheme consists in their participation in thecollective give-and-take of critical discussions and not in some special relation (ofdetachment, hardheadedness) they may bear to their observations.20Though Longino does not get into this, there is an additional concern about what exactly a value-free individual might look like, and whether the concept makes any sense when applied to realhuman beings. Consider, for instance, a medical researcher who is making a decision aboutwhich disease to investigate in her research. She is not value-free if she chooses to investigateone disease rather than another because that disease affected, or even killed, a friend or loved-one. She is not value-free if she chooses to investigate a disease affecting impoverished people indeveloping nations on the basis of concerns about social justice and maximum benefit. And, withrespect to social values, she is not value-free when she chooses which disease to research basedon the available funding for research as set out by the national research institute in her homecountry. So what would value-free decisions at this stage look like? The difficulty incharacterizing a process of value-free reasoning persists in cases where we examine choices ofresearch method, of outcomes, of which journal to publish in (or whether to publish) and so on.That is, it persists at every stage from the very first to the very last choice made in the research 20 Longino, Science as Social Knowledge, 79. In a similar statement in another paper she writes, \"Knowledge andobjectivity, on this view, are identified as the outcomes of social interactions and, hence, are located not inindividuals but in communities. Individuals must participate in these interactions in order that knowledge beproduced; but their objectivity consists in such participation and not in any special cognitive attitude (for example,impartiality or distance) they bear to proposed objects of knowledge.\" Longino, \"Essential Tensions - Phase Two,\"268.212process. It is no less a value-laden choice when the researcher aims to do the right thing andchoose the most judicious topic, method, outcome, or journal, than when she aims to act self-interestedly and chooses the topic, method, outcome or journal based on personal gain. Some ofthese choices are laudable and others are not, and we have good reasons for making theseassessments - but they are all underpinned by values. It is not clear that we can make any senseout of the claim that scientists can learn to reason in a wholly value-free manner. Values pervadeall aspects of knowledge production. We had best get on with dealing with those values.In a statement consistent with the comments I have just raised, Longino rejects the typesof individual objectivity2 that attempt to characterize the ways in which an individual's reasoningprocesses might be more or less objective:Knowledge, in the view I will advocate is produced not by individuals as individuals butby communities - that is, by individuals in interaction with each other. This means thatnormativity, if it's possible at all, must be imposed on social processes and interactions,that the rules or norms of justification that distinguish knowledge (or justified hypothesisacceptance) from opinion must operate at the level of social as opposed to individualcognitive processes.21It is not fruitful to talk about the objectivity of individuals. This position is congruent with thecommitments of feminist epistemologists more generally, who tend to stress the inescapablesubjectivity of all human knowers and hence the inappropriate nature of attempts to mask orsuppress our subjective perspectives. The concern with an overemphasis on individualobjectivity is twofold. First, it is not usually, or perhaps ever, achieved. Extensive feministphilosophical investigations lend support to this concern, as do the conceptual problems I havejust raised. Second, even if any of the senses of individual objectivity were to be achieved, thiswould not rule out the influence of social values on the investigation and so may at best beconsidered necessary - though not sufficient - for objectivity. And yet the trend in the literatureaiming to 'fix' value-laden science is often in favour of greater emphasis on detachment andmechanisms designed to increase the value-freedom of individual perspectives. This is dangerouswhen it obscures the influence of social values on science. I will discuss this danger further in thenext section of the chapter. Concerns about the persistent role of social values in scientificresearch are summed up by Longino as follows: 21 Longino, \"Essential Tensions,\" 260. Emphasis added.213The transformation of an idea into scientific knowledge has the effect of purging it ofidiosyncratic features of its initial proponents. This gives it an impersonalism oftenmisinterpreted as objectivity. It is not the impersonality, however, but the collaborativesocial process of transformative interrogation that makes it objective. And while themarks of the individual may be eliminated by this process, the marks of culture are not.22According to these descriptions, Longino's account of objectivity is focused entirely on socialobjectivity3; she argues that social mechanisms can be used to limit the influence of values onknowledge. Her social account of objectivity is meant to replace, rather than complement, anindividualist account.233.3. Social Objectivity3CCE is based on a social account of objectivity. Of the three possible social accounts, the firsttwo are rejected in favour of the third. I will outline the reasons for this choice below.3.3.1. Concordant ObjectivityConcordant objectivity is afflicted with a familiar problem. Recall that concordant objectivity isachieved when there is agreement within a community. Because this form of objectivity stopsshort of specifying further criteria for the process leading to agreement, it is vulnerable tocriticisms about potential abuses. If all that matters is agreement, and not how that agreementwas achieved, there is a significant potential for distortions based on power, authority andinfluence - as there would be in any human community under this relatively weak requirement.Powerful community members may force or manipulate others into agreement under thisaccount. Specification of the procedure leading to agreement seems more likely to bringpowerful forces to light, provided the procedure includes conditions designed to ferret out andcritically examine such forces. Unfortunately, as noted earlier, attempts to save concordantobjectivity by specifying that the process leading to agreement should be rational or pluralisticturns concordant objectivity into interactive objectivity. For these reasons, Longino is not an 22 Longino, Science as Social Knowledge, 224. Emphasis added.23 Longino, \"Subjects, Power and Knowledge,\" 113.214advocate of concordant objectivity. This likely is not a big surprise, given that feminists aregenerally concerned about the sorts of oppression that can result from precisely these sorts ofinstitutional arrangements. I turn now to procedural objectivity, which is much less easilydefeated and also much more common.3.3.2. Procedural ObjectivityProcedural objectivity is appealing due in no small part to the democratic principles it appears toencode. If we can set up an objective procedure, then we can rely on the results of this procedurewithout having to waste time analyzing the outcomes. And the people who actually carry out theprocedure are fully interchangeable and are prevented from contaminating the results with theiridiosyncratic values. There are costs to this, however. In order to set up a procedure we need tomake a number of assumptions about the nature of the knowledge we intend on getting, and thetypes of questions and methodologies that will get us there. This is the problem of hiddenbackground assumptions. Drawing on the example of the multiple choice exam offered byDouglas, while such exams can be reliably marked by any number of evaluators, they can onlyproduce results restricted to the set of questions that can be fit into the multiple-choice format.And, as all teachers and professors know, a student may appear to be quite knowledgeable on amultiple exam and significantly less so on, for instance, an essay exam. If we think of the varietyof formats available for testing an individual's skills, the multiple choice exam is useful in somecontexts, for some questions, and any attempt to suggest that it should be used to evaluate allskills in all disciplines would be ridiculous (imagine someone testing bedside manner or surgicalskill in this way) no matter how \"objective\" it might be. Multiple choice exams and other strictprocedures for evaluating information rely for their proper application on an appreciation of theassumptions upon which they were constructed.Because social values may be encoded in, among other things, the choice of question,intervention or outcome, the threshold for significance, and more broadly in the expectation thatcomplex, difficult or obscure factors will be (and should be) eliminated within a particularprocedure, multiple choice exams and other procedures thought to produce objective results areoften inaccurately portrayed as socially objective.24 No matter how successful such 24 Douglas, \"The Irreducible Complexity of Objectivity,\" 461-2.215methodologies and rules are in preventing individual values from influencing the collection oranalysis of observations, there remain countless more insidious ways in which contextual valuesinfluence scientific research.25 The false sense of objectivity created by the use of strict rule-based procedures may do harm when it leads to claims to objectivity in cases where social valuespersist. This false sense of objectivity has been of particular concern to feminist scholars as it hasoften led to an inappropriate trust in science and scientists, to the detriment especially of thosemembers of oppressed groups who have traditionally had the least authority to challenge theresults of such science. Longino is interested in developing an account of scientific inquiry thatacknowledges and deals with social values, and which permits for the critical evaluation ofhidden background assumptions. Procedural objectivity alone will not suffice for this project.3.3.3. Interactive ObjectivityWith respect to the modes of objectivity identified by Douglas, CCE focuses exclusively onsocial objectivity3 - and in particular on interactive objectivity. Longino states that it is onlysocial processes that matter in determining the objectivity of scientific research. Socialobjectivity3 is not adopted in conjunction with commitments to experimental and individualobjectivity but in opposition to these other senses. So the interesting and potentially innovativemove by Longino, then, is the rejection of the need for discussions of individual objectivity andthe replacement of individual objectivity with a socialized, contextualized, interactiveobjectivity. Perhaps more to the point for this analysis, Longino is very critical of proceduralobjectivity and outlines the ways in which such an approach falls short. Longino's biggestconcern is with the dangers of unexamined background assumptions in scientific inquiry, sincethey often encode social values. Procedural objectivity can exacerbate this problem, since itmasks social values under the guise of objective procedures and rules, as we have just seen. Thisdoes not mean that there is no place for procedures designed to secure objectivity, only that thelimitations of such procedures must be appreciated.The products of scientific communities are objective to the extent that the communityupholds four norms: avenues for criticism, responsiveness to criticism, shared public standardsand diverse perspectives. The four norms create the conditions for critical community 25 This is discussed further in Chapter Two.216discussions. The transparent disclosure of a diverse set of subjective values combined withcertain criteria for open, critical, responsive debate contribute to the interactive objectivity ofknowledge claims made by a community.26 These conditions make it more likely that thebackground assumptions underlying knowledge claims in the community have been subjected totransformative criticism. Longino writes,[T]he greater the number of different points of view included in a given community, themore likely it is that its scientific practice will be objective, that is, that it will result indescriptions and explanations of natural processes that are...less characterized byidiosyncratic subjective preferences of community members than would otherwise be thecase.27There will be context-specific requirements for this sort of objectivity; it will be necessary tospecify the appropriate avenues for debate, the sorts of diverse perspectives that will be attendedto, and the appropriate weighting of different epistemic values. Determining the particularstructural arrangements that will best meet these requirements is a matter for empiricalinvestigation. Setting out the requirements in the first place is a philosophical task, and this iswhat CCE does.4. ConcernsIn response to this defence of interactive objectivity, a critic might point out that procedural andconcordant objectivity are not necessarily incompatible with interactive objectivity. We canrespect other forms of social objectivity without compromising our commitment to interactiveobjectivity or social epistemology more broadly. Procedures (procedural objectivity) alone areproblematic, but within a larger context of interactive objectivity, they might have a role to play.In the original article in which the eight senses of objectivity are elucidated, Douglas argues thateach sense is unique, and that we should embrace the irreducible complexity of objectivity. Isn'tLongino subverting this inclusive project by suggesting that, not only are all senses of individualobjectivity problematic, but also that most forms of social objectivity - with the exception ofinteractive objectivity - fail as well? 26 Longino refers to this as contextual objectivity.27 Longino, Science as Social Knowledge, 80.217Strict rule-based procedures create the conditions for trust. People are more inclined tounderstand and accept the results of such procedures. While advocates of procedural objectivitydescribe this as factoring out the particular researcher (by making researchers interchangeable),another way of describing the situation is to say that we are enhancing the conditions ofinteractive objectivity by making our research as publicly accessible as possible. The results ofrule-based procedures are not yet objective until they have been scrutinized by a variety ofresearchers from diverse backgrounds, but the character of the procedure may make it morelikely that diverse researchers can engage in the discussion. So we no longer decree the results ofthese procedures objective in virtue of the way they were produced, but we can acknowledge thatsome procedures make it easier for other researchers to engage with and critically evaluateresearch. So it can be useful to set up rule-based procedures insofar as they make the interactiveevaluation of results more likely to occur. In this way, procedural mechanisms are subsumedwithin an account such that offered by CCE. To reiterate, however, we reserve the honorific titleof \"objective\" for the results of interactive debate.Marianne Janack has suggested that attempts to isolate the core meaning of objectivitywill always miss out on some important aspects of this 'variegated motley' ideal. Thus, sherejects Robert Nozick's attempt to equate objectivity with invariance, Arthur Fine's attempt toisolate trust as the central goal of objectivity, and Longino's attempt to suggest that objectivity isthe label we assign to the products of transformative community debate. According to Janack,these attempts are problematic because they disguise the fact that \"a vast and disparate array ofvirtues, goods, and procedures are collected under the umbrella of the concept.\"28 The interestingand potentially fruitful project, she argues, would be to take apart the concept and highlight thetension (and perhaps even inconsistencies) between different senses of the concept. So whileLongino's account is useful in that it contributes to our overall understanding of objectivity,Janack suggest that the account is too concerned with unification, or, at the very least, isolatingthe core important element of objectivity.To add to this, one might question whether paring down the concept of objectivity in thisway puts extra pressure on Longino's criterion of empirical adequacy. Is this concept going tohave to 'pick up the slack', as it were, for the slimmed down account of objectivity? We havealready seen the ways in which Longino leaves elements of experimental and individual 28 Janack, \"Dilemmas of Objectivity,\" 279.218objectivity out of her account, preferring to leave discussion of such things to the debate overempiricism. How much can we build into empiricism and is this division of labour betweenjustification and empirical adequacy problematic in any way? I think the burden of proof is onJanack and others to show that Longino's empiricist criterion cannot contain everything assignedto it. I have not seen a full argument to that effect yet, so at this point I am content to say thatLongino's characterization of objectivity is a good one. However I will certainly be attentive toany arguments made on this matter in the future, since I think it could potentially become aproblem.5. Objectivity and Values in Medical ResearchWhat is the overriding concern in science today; what, in Daston and Galison's terms, is the mostdangerous form of subjectivity in modern scientific inquiry? According to their historicalanalysis, scientists in the late twentieth century are preoccupied with the corrupting influence ofindividual idiosyncratic values. Scientists have recognized that they have to take steps to ensurethat individual values do not limit their ability to understand the natural world. Because of this,there is a lot of attention to individual objectivity: we are all familiar with the requirement thatscientists aim to be value-free (in Douglas' terms). In addition, scientists have developed strictmethodologies and procedures in order to prevent any remaining individual values from having adistortional effect on the results of scientific research. The trend in science is to rely uponscientists to be value-free and methodologies to be procedurally objective. This two-prongedapproach to the objectivity of scientific inquiry is noticeable in the medical context. I will bepaying special attention to the reliance on procedural objectivity. Before turning to thisinvestigation, it is worth taking a moment to discuss the possible reasons for this shift toprocedural objectivity.5.1. Why Procedural Objectivity?In his book Trust in Numbers: The pursuit of objectivity in science and public life, historianTheodore Porter outlines various political and sociological factors that led to the current reliance219on procedural objectivity in certain areas of science.29 In particular, Porter focuses on two factorsthat have been particularly influential: lack of trust and contested boundaries. With respect to theformer, he draws attention to the lack of public trust in the personal judgements of scientists, andthe desire of scientists to overcome this distrust. According to Porter, methods and rules thoughtto be objective often serve as an alternative to trust in the sciences.30 Alfred Tauber has writtenpersuasively about the erosion of trust in medicine over the past half century, and theconsiderable \"crisis in trust\" facing medicine today.31 Drawing on Gallup polls, he offersevidence that trust in medical professionals - particularly physicians - has been slowly erodingover the past fifty years in the USA. Similar trends have been noted in Canada.32With respect to the latter, Porter reveals that scientists working in contested domains,such as medicine, have often attempted to gain (or regain) the respect of other scientists, and thepublic, by relying heavily on inflexible quantitative methods - so-called objective procedures.33Heavy reliance on procedural objectivity is most common in disciplines that lack clearboundaries, and which are engaged in defending insecure boundaries against outsiders.34 Even abrief history of medicine in North America indicates a persistent negotiation (often a rathercutthroat 'negotiation') over the boundaries of the medical domain. Today, physicians defend theboundaries of the medical domain from \"web doctors\", government regulators, administrators,and alternative medical practitioners. In these sorts of contested disciplines, \"We find there is apervasive dread of 'the prejudice of the investigator', often a willingness to leave untouched themost important issues in order to deal objectively with those can be adequately quantified.\"35 Inmedicine, we see reliance on the results of research thought to be most objective, even when thismeans neglecting fruitful evidence lower on the evidence hierarchy. With this brief historicaloverview in mind, let us consider the impact of EBM on methods of securing objective evidence. 29 Porter uses the term mechanical objectivity for what I (following Douglas) call procedural objectivity.30 Porter, Trust in Numbers, 228.31 Tauber, \"In Search of Medicine's Moral Glue,\" 42. Putnam's influential book Bowling Alone: The collapse andrevival of American community is another good source on the erosion of trust in American society generally.32 Kondro, \"Threats to Medical Professionalism Tackled in Canada,\" 316.33 Porter, Trust in Numbers, 211.34 Contrary to what many people might suspect, relatively secure disciplines often eschew strict reliance onprocedures and methods designed to promote objectivity, and are more open-minded about the importance ofcreativity, intuition and expert judgement in their domain. Porter, Trust in Numbers, 230.35 Porter, Trust in Numbers, 229.2205.2. The Procedural Objectivity of RCTsSociologists Stefan Timmermans and Marc Berg have argued that the EBM movement wasdriven largely by a desire for standardization in medicine. In the late 1980s a focus onstandardization (re)emerged in healthcare. In their description of the changes that came about inthis period, Timmermans and Berg write, \"of all the kinds of standardization attempts thataffected medicine in the twentieth century, evidence-based guidelines represent the farthestreaching and most direct attempts to prescribe and preset the actions of healthcareprofessionals.\"36 In contrast with longstanding attempts to institute terminological standards(such as international classifications of diseases) and performance standards (such as a maximumlevel of complication rate for an operation), the EBM movement proposed procedural standards(including clinical practice rules and guidelines for physicians, and the evidence hierarchy forresearchers).37 This form of standardization relies on a procedural account of objectivity.Top ranked research methods, such as the RCT, are expected to produce maximallyobjective results. It is not difficult to detect the underlying commitment to procedural objectivityin the evidence hierarchy. You can replace the team of researchers with any other team and getthe same results if they were to perform the same RCT. So research methods, particularly RCTs,are thought to be best at getting objective results. And the idea is that as you work your waydown the hierarchy, the research methodologies are less and less able to rule out the idiosyncraticvalues of the researcher. The best procedures are those that eliminate the individual researcher tothe greatest extent possible. It comes as no surprise, then, that qualitative methodologies are nothighly valued. A reliance on procedural objectivity in medicine indicates great concern withcertain specific individual values that may influence research during the course of trials, but verylittle attention to social values or individual values that may have an influence before and afterthe trial.5.3. The Evaluation-based Education Analogy 36 Timmermans and Berg, The Gold Standard, 14.37 Ibid., 25.221Consider the following analogy.38 A group of teachers and administrators from a highly-regardedteaching institution decide that there is a problem with the state of education in Ontario. Let'scall them the Evaluation-based Education (EBE) Working Group. They develop a new way ofevaluating the effectiveness of public education. They propose a hierarchy of exam types whichelevates multiple-choice exams as the gold standard, places short answer questions in the middleof the hierarchy, and ranks essay exams, oral exams and in-class and informal discussions at thebottom as means of evaluating students. Whenever possible, multiple-choice exams arerecommended, and it is even better if they can be standardized and used throughout the province.Teachers are advised to use the top-ranked methods for evaluating their students, and then resultsare compared across classrooms and schools. While the studies yield information about howindividual students are faring, and how certain sub-groups within schools and classrooms aredoing, this is not the information of most interest to the EBE group. Rather, attention is focusedon the average student data, which is used to determine whether the education received bystudents overall has been effective. This hierarchy is justified in part on the basis of argumentsabout the relative objectivity of different evaluation techniques. Multiple-choice exams can bereliably marked by any evaluator, and a machine can even do it if we want to remove theevaluator completely. Thus the influence of individual values (of the marker/evaluator in thiscase) can be as diminished as possible. Or so it seems.In a climate of pervasive evaluation-based education I suspect we would find educatorsasking themselves two questions. First, are we necessarily getting at more objective results whenwe use the best methodologies according to the hierarchy devised by the EBE group? Andsecond, what are we trading off in order to gain objectivity? This first question is vital becausethe multiple-choice exam only appears objective because the evaluator has little control over theparticular outcome during the period of evaluation. But the evaluator has a great deal of control 38 This sort of movement is already happening in education. The What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) formed by theInstitute of Educational Sciences in the United States, for instance, provides research evidence to support theirrecommendations on educational reform. The evidence is presented in a surprisingly medicalized manner (though itwould be judged to be of very low quality by EBM standards). The WWC standards of evidence have two criteriafor quality of study design: \"RCT (meets evidence standards) or QED (meets evidence standards withreservations).\" Also considered in the overall evaluation are: effect size, sample size and statistical significance. It isnot possible to assign an intervention the top rating of \"positive effects\" without having evidence from at least oneRCT. http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/reports/beginning%5Freading/success%5Ffor%5Fall/effectiveness.asp. Similarly,the \"No Child Left Behind\" program in the United States is built on four principles: \"accountability for results, morechoices for parents, greater local control and flexibility, and an emphasis on doing what works based on scientificresearch.\" Emphasis added. http://www.ed.gov/nclb/overview/intro/edpicks.jhtml?src=ln.222over the particular outcome when they decide which material should be tested in the first place,choose to put certain questions and not others on the exam, curve the grades after the fact, ordecide to exclude students who received 0's from the final calculation so as not to distort theoverall results. It does not look like we are achieving objectivity in any robust sense merely byapplying the hierarchy. Moving to the second question, in the educational context it seems clearthat we are trading off our ability to evaluate certain important skills that students have (such aswriting skills) in order to have more objective evaluations of other skills (such ascomprehension). If these standards of evaluation are persistently applied it follows that we wouldhave very little access to information about how well our students are learning to write(assuming we still bother to teach it at all). And yet we might think that it is important toevaluate a wide range of skills, and that we do a disservice to our assessment of students whenwe limit our evaluations in this way.The answer to the first question above - are we necessarily getting at more objectiveresults when we use the best methodologies according to the hierarchy? - is no. I presented anargument to this effect in Chapter Five. That makes the second question even more important,since we are trading off all sorts of things and not even getting what we think out of the deal. Wedo not necessarily get more objective results, so what are we paying for this privilege? I will turnnow to the question of trade-offs.5.4. Economic Models and RCTsNancy Cartwright has recently drawn an analogy between RCTs and models in economics.39Cartwright argues that models in economics are \"front-loaded\". All sorts of substantive (andvalue-based) assumptions are made in the design of economic models, and if those assumptionsare correct the models deliver remarkably consistent - even, she claims, deductively valid -results.40 That is, they are extremely good at establishing the internal validity of their results.There are costs to this however. We pay the price with two distinct types of trade-offs. The mostobvious is the trade-off between internal validity (or rigour) and external validity (or real world 39 Cartwright, \"Gold is where you know what you need to know.\"40 Cartwright, \"The Vanity of Galilean Experiments.\" Cartwright ismistaken in believing that these models can ever be deductively valid. At best, such models seem to establish theirconclusions through eliminative induction.223applicability). We can call this the trade-off for rigour. If a model or method must be highlyidealized or rely on a number of critical assumptions in order to produce deductively validoutcomes, it is often inappropriate to assume that results and outcomes can be applied beyond thescope of the initial conditions. Moreover, if it turns out that any of the assumptions propping upsuch a model or method is suspect, we are left with highly contested results with littleapplicability.Returning to the similarities between economics and medicine, then, the results of RCTs,as with economic models, can be very strong but they come at a high input cost. If any of theassumptions turns out to be shaky, the validity and applicability of the results is compromised. Inchapters four and five I argued that we have good reason to question assumptions about theepistemic superiority of RCTs. The second trade-off we make is that we give up investigatingother types of questions. This is an intellectual trade-off. We could investigate the economicsituation in a way that would give us personal narratives as data, but we choose to investigate itin a way that gives us numbers. Similarly, we give up investigating biological mechanisms ofdisease or sources of physician-patient miscommunications for the sorts of questions that can beasked in a RCT. This diminishes the range of research we perform and the range of treatmentswe offer. We will always have to make trade-offs but if we do not explicitly recognize that this iswhat is happening, we cannot subject the decisions to critical analysis. Transparency is the firststep to accountability when making these sorts of decisions. It is precisely transparency on trade-offs that is not discussed within EBM.5.5. Method and MethodsThe danger of relying on procedural objectivity, or objectivity of method, is that a (legitimate)focus on practice or process (method, broadly construed) shifts to a (somewhat narrower) focuson particular research trial designs (methods). Thus, scientists come to believe that a particularresearch method or trial design fully secures objectivity, and thus end up neglecting the otherelements of scientific practice and process - or method, broadly construed - (such as criticaldebate) that are also significant in contributing to objectivity. This highlights the distinctionbetween procedural objectivity in medicine, which focuses on particular research methods, andinteractive objectivity, which focuses on community-level structural features. What is needed in224medicine is greater attention to social structures of knowledge-production. The conditions ofinteractive objectivity could enhance the production of knowledge in medicine.6. Interactive Objectivity and MedicineThe version of critical contextual empiricism I offered in Chapter Two proposes four normsdesigned to ensure adequate critical debate within knowledge-productive communities. The thirdand fourth norms - shared public standards and cultivation of diverse perspectives - serve todefine the boundaries of the community. The requirement that communities recognize theperspectives offered by qualified others serves to protect diversity, while the requirement ofshared standards protects unity. These two requirements push against each other and the tensionbetween the two shapes the boundaries of particular communities. These norms play animportant role in ensuring the interactive objectivity of knowledge produced in a community.This role was discussed in detail in chapters two and six. In addition, the first requirement -recognized avenues for criticism - provides direction on how to ensure interactive objectivity(and responsiveness to criticism) through social mechanisms. In what follows I will discussspecific recommendations for the medical community suggested by the first CCE norm.6.1. Recognized Avenues for Criticism: The Open Science MovementAccording to CCE, there must be recognized avenues for criticism within knowledge-productivecommunities. In scientific communities, this typically includes peer-reviewed journals,conferences, workshops, and so on. What I will call the \"open science\" movement of recentyears provides a number of specific recommendations for ensuring the transparency andpublicity of scientific research. In other words, it provides recommendations for ensuringrecognized avenues for criticism and for ensuring community members make use of theseavenues. These include: rejection of non-disclosure clauses in research contracts, disclosure ofcompeting interests in publications, prohibitions on ghost authorships, a mandatory clinical trialsregistry, open peer-review, open access journals, open submission processes, public funding forresearch, an emphasis on original research, greater awareness of the collective nature of medical225decision-making, and more comprehensive analytic training for health professionals. I willdiscuss each of these recommendations with respect to the medical context.6.1.1. Regulation of Research ContractsMedical researchers often receive funding for their trials from pharmaceutical companies.Because these companies have an interest in maintaining control over the data produced by thetrials they sponsor, they sometimes require that researchers sign contracts in which they agreenot to discuss research findings unless approved by the company. These are referred to as non-disclosure clauses in research contracts. For example, in the mid 1990s, Nancy Olivieri, aresearcher at the University of Toronto and The Hospital for Sick Children, undertook a trialfunded by Apotex Inc. (a pharmaceutical company). As part of her contract, Olivieri agreed tothe following non-disclosure clause:All information whether or not obtained or generated by the investigators during the termof this agreement and for a period of one year thereafter, shall be and remain secret andconfidential and shall not be disclosed in any manner to any third party, except to anappropriate regulatory agency for the purposes of obtaining regulatory approval tomanufacture, use or sell [the drug] unless the information has been previously disclosedto the public with the consent of Apotex. The investigator shall not submit anyinformation for publication without the prior written approval of Apotex.41Reference to \"any third party\" here includes patients. At the time Olivieri signed the contract,such non-disclosure clauses were common. The complexities of the Olivieri case have now filledseveral hundred pages in many books and publications, and it is not my intention to repeat thosedescriptions or analyses here. What I would like to do is draw attention the problematic nature ofnon-disclosure clauses. A cursory overview of the case will be helpful to this end.Medical professor and researcher Nancy Olivieri entered into a contract with Apotexagreeing to the clause just cited (among others). Part way into a trial on a new drug she grewconcerned about a significant number of patients who appeared to be doing worse under the newtreatment. Representatives from Apotex disagreed with Olivieri's interpretation of thepreliminary data and advised her not to convey her concerns to the patients in the trial. WhenOlivieri did so against their wishes they terminated the trial and pursued legal action against her. 41 Quoted in Shafer.226The case was resolved in favour of Olivieri many years later. The Olivieri case drew attention tothe decrease in control over research data by primary researchers and the potential for significantharm when researchers are not allowed to convey concerns to their patients or talk about theseconcerns with colleagues. What non-disclosure clauses do is shut down avenues for criticaldiscussion. The Olivieri case highlights the epistemic damage done by such agreements and thepotential harms that arise. As of March, 2001, the teaching hospitals affiliated with theUniversity of Toronto have harmonized their policies on research contracts so that contracts aremore carefully analyzed for potential conflicts of interest. In light of the scandal surrounding thisinternationally recognized case, researchers have become more aware of the dangers of signingconfidentiality agreements with pharmaceutical companies. Non-disclosure clauses are widelyregarded as damaging to the scientific process.426.1.2. Declaration of Competing InterestsIn a relatively recent development, all of the top medical journals now require researchers todeclare any competing interests or potential conflicts of interest they have with respect to theresearch they are submitting for publication. So, for example, if a trial is funded in part orentirely by those who stand to profit from positive results, this must be disclosed uponpublication. Requirements of disclosure are helpful at highlighting potential biases, though it isunclear exactly what action the reader of such a publication is meant to take, aside from taking asomewhat more critical attitude toward the results.6.1.3. Prohibition on Ghost AuthorshipsGhost authoring occurs when the names of researchers who did not contribute substantially to atrial are included in the list of authors at publication. Ghostwriters are professional writers whoare paid (usually by pharmaceutical companies) to write up the results of medical trials. Theseghostwriters do not retain any credit for their work in the final publication, but pass that creditalong to others (ghost authors) for a price. Often pharmaceutical companies will look for well 42 I occasionally speak about the dangers of \"corporate interests\" in science. To clarify, I am concerned with thosecases in which corporate interests impinge on the processes integral to good scientific practice. I believe that to bethe case with non-disclosure clauses.227known and highly regarded researchers (\"Key Opinion Leaders\" or \"Thought Leaders\") whosenames they can attach to a particular publication as ghost authors. Ghost authoring is reportedlywidespread in medicine. 43 The \"thought leaders\" who agree to attach their name to a publicationare often restricted from viewing the original data from the trial. Instead they are given onlyalready-analyzed and carefully selected data: that which reflects most positively on thetreatment. What this means is that researchers acting as ghost authors are unable to offer anycritical perspective on the data they are claiming to have produced. This significantly limits theopportunity for genuine critical discussion on the results of research. Medical journals have takensteps to limit this practice by requiring that authors on publications explicitly describe their levelof involvement in the research, but the practice is still common.446.1.4. Clinical Trials RegistryIn order to ensure recognized avenues for criticism, the medical community has to extend criticalsocial mechanisms beyond requirements placed on researchers, reviewers and journal editors.One of the concerns raised in recent years has been with the selective reporting of the results oftrials. Articles finding a positive effect for a new treatment are more likely to be published thanthose with negative results. This is heightened in the case of positive studies for pharmaceuticaldrugs where the pharmaceutical company sponsored the research.45 In response to this trendtoward suppressing negative results, critics have argued for the importance of public registrationof research trials. Over the past few decades, the support for a public clinical trials registry hasgrown, though most versions today remain voluntary and piecemeal and so have a limitedinfluence.46 In 2000, the National Research Register was established in the U.K. In 2004, theHouse of Delegates of the American Medical Association called for the comprehensiveregistration of all clinical trials conducted in the United States through the National Library of 43 Laine and Mulrow.44 Ibid.45 Bekelman et al.; Sackett and Oxman.46 The voluntary registry set up by the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), for instance, hasbeen only marginally successful in posting information about ongoing trials in the U.K.: \"The completeness of theinformation varies widely and often comes nowhere near what was promised in the initial ABPI press release.\"Similarly, www.clinicaltrials.gov, the website set up by the American National Institutes of Health, has been onlymarginally successful in getting researchers to register their trials. See Rennie, \"Trial Registration\" for details.228Medicine website.47 Registration was to be monitored by the ethics boards charged withapproving trials. As of 2004, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors states that,\"trial registration is largely voluntary, registry data set and public access to them vary, andregistries contain only a small proportion of trials.\"48 This is in spite of what these editors believeto be the significant advantage of trial registration for the medical community.Pharmaceutical companies including GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Merck & Co., Johnson &Johnson, and Eli Lilly & Co. have all indicated some willingness to post ongoing studies online.While there is some resistance, the pharmaceutical industry is struggling with its public image inlight of various recent drug scandals and is more open to the suggestion that might otherwise beexpected. Of course, there are a variety of proposed loopholes to registration includingregistering only late-stage clinical trials or trials after approval or publication. The deputy editorof JAMA firmly states that exceptions and qualifications of these sorts are inappropriate. There isno use for a registry unless it is: adequately funded, mandatory, designed to include all trials,adequately policed, equipped with stiff penalties, and most of all independent.49 A registry thatmeets these criteria would go some way to providing the information required for a propercritical evaluation of evidence. It would help prevent unnecessary duplication of research andfulfill ethical commitments to research participants who should have access to the results ofresearch in which they participated. Such a registry would have to be supported by ResearchEthics Boards, journal editors and individual researchers in order for it to be successful. TheWorld Health Organization has set up the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platformwhich may serve this purpose in the future. Currently the standard appears to be the Americanwebsite: www.clinicaltrials.gov.6.1.5. Open Peer-reviewOf the avenues for critical debate within medicine, peer-reviewed journals are primary. Peer-review of submissions to medical journals allows for a range of outside perspectives on themethods and results of research, the value of the questions asked and the quality and relevance ofthe findings. However, peer review can also be a mechanism for exclusion, particularly when 47 www.clinicaltrials.gov48 De Angelis et al., 1363.49 Rennie.229blind evaluation is circumvented. Blind evaluation takes place when the identity of authors ismasked so that reviewers do not know whose research they are evaluating.50 Blind evaluationwas originally thought to prevent conflicts of interest during review. The concern was thatreviewers might be influenced by their relationship, whether collegial or competitive, with theauthors of the papers they are reviewing. Recently, there have been a number of scholars whohave argued that sufficiently motivated reviewers have no trouble bypassing mechanisms ofblinding.51 Because blind evaluation is not actually occurring much of the time, it is not aparticularly efficient mechanism. Transparency, or unmasked review, has been a popular topic ofdiscussion in the past few years. Transparent, or open, peer-review can aid in the appropriateevaluation of research since it allows reviewers to contextualize the findings (\"Oh they're fromso-and-so's lab/clinic, I see why they have done it this way\") and offer more specific and helpfulcomments. It also prevents reviewers from hiding behind their anonymity and encourages deepercritical engagement among researchers because comments and responses can go back and forthfor some time. Of course, this is not to say that it would be unproblematic. Certainly there will beresearchers who take the opportunity to unfairly critique the work of new researchers or oldrivals. However, 1) there are reasons to think that this is happening already, and 2) there areadditional mechanisms in the open science movement that may help address these problems.The recent open peer-review experiment undertaken by Nature in 2006, for instance, wasnot only transparent about authors and reviewers, it allowed any other members of the researchcommunity to add comments to the submitted manuscript online, as long as they identifiedthemselves when doing so. Traditional peer-review was complemented by online comments, andeditors used both to make final decisions.52 While researchers were, on the whole, not thatinterested in open peer-review (only 5% of authors opted to post their manuscripts for publicreview) the relative unpopularity of the open process is subject to change and does not bear onthe epistemic value of such a process. In fact, all of the authors who received additional onlinecomments found them to be at least somewhat valuable. The main concern seemed to be withlack of comments, since many of the papers did not receive additional comments online. Theeditor of Nature suggested that researchers were too busy and \"lacked sufficient career 50 Occasionally this is reversed so that the reviewer is known to the authors but the authors remain unknown to thereviewer. This is still considered (single) blind evaluation.51 Falagas, Zouglakis and Kavvadia; Yankauer.52 Editorial, \"Peer Review and Fraud: Two assessments of the refereeing process highlight challenges for journals.\"230incentive\" to spend time commenting on the work of peers online.53 Further, he suggests thatattitudes may be different if researchers are asked to comment on already-published papers andhe proposes to investigate this possibility. If researchers were more interested in criticalengagement after publication, this would still be a great contribution to the interactive objectivityof research since publication is no strict marker of knowledge. Further empirical investigationson the most effective form of peer-review are warranted.6.1.6. Open Access JournalsA number of medical journals have instituted policies that would improve the availability andtransparency of research to members of the medical community. Most medical journals havesections dedicated to opinion pieces and editorials, and physicians often take advantage of thesevenues in order to pursue arguments with colleagues. In addition, many journals now offer a\"rapid response\" feature, which allows researchers to provide immediate electronic feedback onnew research, with minimum effort. Taking this a step further, open access journals provideonline content free of charge to anyone regardless of institutional affiliation. Such journals notonly provide an location for critical discussions, they ensure that all members of the medicalcommunity have access to these discussions, as do the members of other communities (includingCAM communities) and the public. This contributes to the diversity of perspectives involved inmedical debates and increases avenues for critical discussion.6.1.7. Open Submission ProcessMedical researchers often submit their research to top medical journals, only to be rejected. Themanuscript is then resubmitted to a journal with a lower impact factors and a somewhat lessprestigious reputation. This continues until the manuscript is accepted for publication. An opensubmission process would require authors who resubmit papers to include the original reviewers'comments. This provides subsequent reviewers and editors with a good sense of what has beensaid before, what changes have been requested, and allows them the opportunity to build onthese comments when making their own. In effect, such a policy would allow reviewers to learn 53 Ibid., 972.231from and actively engage with fellow reviewers. This would have an additional practical benefitof expediting the review process, which can otherwise drag on for months. Open submissioncould contribute to a greater sense of community critical evaluation and collaboration.Alternatively, it might condone laziness in reviewing (\"I will just agree with what the otherperson said\") or lead to greater deference to authority (\"If a top medical reviewer thinks this isnot good, he or she must be correct\"). However, in spite of these potential difficulties, the idea isstill a good one in terms of increasing avenues for critical discussion, since it opens up greaterdiscussion among reviewers.6.1.8. Public Funding of ResearchMedical researchers aim to provide accurate information about the value of particular medicaltreatments. Pharmaceutical companies, in virtue of their status as corporations, are committed tomaximizing profits for their stakeholders. Intellectual and financial interests are not always inaccord. While these two goals can overlap in some instances, to varying degrees, there are manyopportunities for tension and conflict. Steven Lewis describes the partnership between scientificresearchers (and the academic institutions in which they work) and pharmaceutical companies asone in which researchers are forced to \"dance with the porcupine\".54 Precautions must be taken toprotect the integrity of the dancers if they are to remain free of punctures and lacerations. Moreoutspoken critics have suggested that the appropriate analogy is, rather, one of swimming withthe sharks: \"those who swim with the sharks may find that they have become little more thanshark bait. To avoid such a cruel fate...it might be necessary to decline the swimming invitationaltogether.\"55 Commercial interests influence the motives and goals of researchers and, despiteself-righteous claims to the contrary, have an impact on the type of research that gets done, howit gets done and who it benefits. Patentable and profitable treatments will always have toppriority in the research programs of those interested in making money. While many differentconcerns are raised about potential conflicts of interest arising out of partnerships betweenacademic researchers and commercial industries, I will focus on the potential for such apartnership - however otherwise beneficial - to diminish the avenues for criticism available to 54 Lewis et al., 783.55 Shafer, 9.232researchers. Even if confidentiality clauses are disallowed and ghostwriters are restricted bypublication rules set by journal editors, commercial interests can limit the inclination researchershave to critically discuss their work with colleagues:Critics fear that wide scale commercial funding has already produced an erosion ofcooperation and community among biomedical researchers. Instead of an easy sharing ofknowledge and reagents, one finds something approximating a quasi-Hobbesian war ofeach (laboratory) against all (others).56Commercial interests influence the type and quality of interactions among researchers. Self-interest and ego have always played a role in scientific research: there is no simple altruisticstory to be told about the interactions of members of scientific communities. However there aredifferences between the sorts of interactions expected in largely publicly-funded communitiesand those in which individual researchers, or teams of researchers, are funded competitively bydifferent commercial interests: \"[T]here is a growing body of evidence to support the conclusionthat the traditional norms of science ought to be placed, forthwith, on the Endangered SpeciesList.\"57 Concerns about subtle changes to the practice of science were raised in the era of BigScience following WWII, but the impact on clinical trials is more recent. Instead of building onthe research of others, researchers have to be concerned that fellow researchers will steal theirideas or beat them to establishing patent rights. These commercial interests influence theinteractions between researchers, and while they do not physically limit avenues for criticaldiscussion they make collaborative sharing of ideas less likely. In order to address this problem,researchers convinced of the value of commercial intervention in medical research are limited tothe reformist measures outlined above (refusing to sign non-disclosure clauses, declaringcompeting interests in publications, etc.). Researchers more skeptical about the impact ofindustry on medical research can join those who call for greater public funding of research andgreater government regulation of the pharmaceutical industry.6.1.9. Emphasis on Original Research 56 Schafer, 15.57 Ibid., 16.233In order for physicians to be responsive to the critical discussion occurring in their midst, theyhave to be attentive to original research. The EBM movement originally emphasized theimportance of critical evaluation of research evidence by individual physicians. As we saw inChapter Four, this requirement has now shifted. Physicians are no longer expected to do all theliterature searches and critical analyses themselves. Instead, these tasks are performed byspecialized experts. The Cochrane Library, POEM (Patient-oriented Evidence that Matters)Database and American College of Physicians (ACP) Journal Club, among other sources,provide analyses of evidence and function as intermediaries between physicians and originalclinical research. Clinical guidelines produced by experts are \"systematically developedstatements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specificclinical circumstances.\"58Individual physicians are expected to turn to the authoritative digests of researchproduced by experts when determining what the best evidence is for a new treatment. EBMproponent Gordon Guyatt (along with some of his colleagues) has admitted that:[N]ot all trainees are interested in attaining an advanced level of evidence-based medicineskills. Our trainees' responses mirror those of British general practitioners, who often usedevidence-based summaries generated by others (72%) and evidence-based guidelines orprotocols (84%) but who overwhelmingly (95%) believe that \"learning the skills of evidence-based medicine\" is not the most appropriate method for \"moving... to evidence-basedmedicine.\"59The distinction between evidence-based users and evidence-based practitioners is meant tocapture the new type of evidence-based physicians, who use guidelines and recommendationsproduced by others rather than doing literature searches and critical analyses themselves. Thetask of critical analysis is contracted out to experts, rather than performed by the individual. Thislimits the number of different perspectives that are brought to bear on the results of research.While groups that compile evidence involve a variety of reviewers, this is not the same as havingindividual physicians perform critical analyses for themselves. Reliance on guidelines means that 58 Field and Lohr. Timmermans and Mauck also point out: \"So many parties have jumped on the EBM bandwagonand so many clinical practice guidelines are churned out by individuals, professional organizations, insurers, andothers that the benefits of uniformity may disappear in the cacophony of overlapping, conflicting, and poorlyconstructed guidelines. With more than 1,000 guidelines created annually, calls for 'guidelines for clinicalguidelines' have been issued.\" See for instance articles by Jackson and Feder; Rosser, Davis, and Gilbart.59 Guyatt et Care,\" 954.234physicians are unable to contextualize evidence in order to determine possible biases and flawsin that research. Moreover, the reviewers themselves introduce a whole new level of biases. Areviewer with a strong bias toward a particular treatment, for instance, could cast the results of ameta-analysis in more favourable light. And all of this is hidden behind an apparently-objectiveand authoritative guideline. The presence of pre-digested guidelines goes against the originalspirit of EBM, and worse, threatens to limit the opportunities for critical discussion on the resultsof research. The critical analysis at the heart of the original EBM movement is arguably onefeature worth retaining - and yet it was the first to be jettisoned. While the difficulties of keepingup with the results of original research are not to be underestimated, reliance on guidelinesproduced by others limits the opportunity for critical engagement with research. Physicians needto resist the temptation to become evidence users and engage with original research rather thanguidelines whenever possible.6.1.10. Medical TeamsEBM focuses on the decisions made by physicians in the care of patients. In Chapter Four Iargued that this neglects the important role played by patients in clinical decision-making. It alsoneglects the role of the patient's family and loved ones. Building on this argument, I also arguethat it neglects the role played by allied health professionals. EBM is concerned primarily withthe decisions made by physicians about patients. But medical decisions are not the exclusivepurview of physicians. Nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists, a variety of medical specialists,ethicists, and even some CAM practitioners have been known to consult together on medicaldecisions. The physician is not the solitary autonomous decision-maker - even when supportedby the latest research evidence. Neglecting the contributions of fellow health care workersimpoverishes the EBM model. And requiring that each contributing health professional beevidence-based in their own right does nothing to change the isolated and ultimately autonomouspractice of EBM in each particular instance. Further, it fails to require that the evidence retrievedby each health professional be shared and collectively debated. Greater attention to the realitiesof decision-making in medicine allows us to recognize that physicians are not isolatedautonomous decision-makers. Health care teams, often consisting of members with diversebackgrounds, are in a better position to produce interactively objective assessments of evidence.235Thus health care teams play an important role in increase the avenues for critical reflection onevidence at the level of clinical decision-making.6.1.11. Analytic Training in Medical EducationPhysicians are highly trained in the technical aspects of medical research and practice. Manycritics have drawn attention to the ways in which this technical focus precludes development ofempathetic skills such as good communication and caring. This deficiency is common and isreflected in standards of evidence: in Chapter Five I discussed some of the ways in whichqualitative research is unfairly denigrated in the medical context even though it is better suited toinvestigating the caring side of medicine. The education of physicians is similarly deficient inteaching analytic skills. As the editor of The Lancet, Richard Horton, puts it, \"The skill thatphysicians lack above all is the ability to reason successfully.\"60 Reasoning skills include theability to critically interrogate an argument, determine gaps in logic, identify fallacies and cometo a logical conclusion on whether an argument is sound or, in the case of an inductive argument,cogent. Reasoning is not \"the skill of switching on a computer, typing in a few key words andprinting out several abstracts of randomized trials or systematic reviews.\"61 While advocates ofEBM stressed the importance of understanding rules of evidence (i.e. the rules of the hierarchy)and basic statistics, without broad training in critical reasoning these elements of evidence-basedpractice remain unsupported. It is no surprise that, in the interim, physicians have turned toguidelines and meta-analyses prepared by others. Greater attention to the skills of criticalreasoning of the sort taught in undergraduate philosophy courses - though ideally with aspecifically medical focus, and using medical examples - would be a great improvement tomedical education and would increase the likelihood that critical debate will occur amongphysicians and researchers.7. Summary 60 Horton, 245.61 Ibid., 245-6.236As Helen Longino has pointed out, debates over the objectivity of various scientific practices,theories, and methodologies have often proceeded without careful attention to the concept ofobjectivity, which too often remains \"insufficiently examined, a closed box hurled back and forthbetween rhetorical contestants.\"62 In this chapter I hope to have alleviated some of this mysteryand offered some reason to think that the current over-emphasis on procedural objectivity in themedical research context is problematic. I argued that the CCE conception of interactiveobjectivity has much to add to this discussion. Finally, I drew upon the CCE norms to proposepractical mechanisms that lend support to the norms of interactive objectivity in the medicalcontext. In particular, I suggested that various elements of the open science movement couldsupport the interactive objectivity of medical evidence. 62 Longino, \"Essential Tensions,\" 261.237ConclusionStandards of medical evidence are developed on the basis of background assumptions. Theseassumptions require scrutiny. A critical contextual empiricist (CCE) analysis of evidence-basedmedicine suggests that assumptions about the need for a more scientific approach to medicaldecision-making rely on simplistic accounts of science and pay insufficient attention to thecognitive goals and practical aims of medical practice. Assumptions that clinical researchevidence should be the base of medical decision-making conflict with persuasive arguments formethodological pluralism in medicine. In addition, the particular assumptions underlying theevidence hierarchy are unjustified; moreover, any attempt to hierarchically organize researchmethods radically misunderstands the purpose of scientific research. Drawing upon my proposedversion of CCE, I criticize the attempt to homogenize medicine which is implicit in currentdemands that complementary and alternative medical researchers adhere to the rules of evidencedeveloped by EBM. Further, I identify a reliance on procedural accounts of objectivity in EBM,and specify the costs of this narrow focus on research methods which severely restrict thecommunity's ability to achieve more robust interactive objectivity.However, a comprehensive appreciation for the limitations of EBM does not leave uswithout guidance in medicine. In response to an article by Sackett and Oxman, in which theauthors trace the biases that can be introduced at various stages of research, physician Jan Brozekwrites:I cannot resist an impression that the EBM as we know it, or at least its part - criticalappraisal of the published medical literature, has reached its limits and found itself indesperate need to develop new tools that would allow assessment of the validity of medicalresearch...the 'usual tools' like CONSORT criteria, Jadad score, the ITT, completeness offollow-up, concealment of randomization, etc. are no longer sufficient to evaluate the validityof the conclusions accompanying the reports from research. One wonders if maybe it is timeto think of developing additional criteria that would help us - users of medical literature - totell [the] more valid from the less valid conclusions? One may also wonder if it is possible atall since expecting that the investigators/sponsors would give out the necessary informationand remain entirely objective in the assessment of their own efforts is na\u00efve.1 1 Brozek.238Brozeck is correct in identifying the limitations of the EBM approach. It is na\u00efve to expect thatthe results of research evidence can be summarized, digested and disseminated as \"facts\"unproblematically. It is also na\u00efve to think that an approach that minimizes the degree of criticalinteraction with research evidence will remain unsullied by the biases introduced by commercialand other contextual social interests. I argue that greater attention to the revised CCE normsisolates the flaws in these assumptions and, crucially, suggests a way forward. According to myanalysis there should be changes to the ways in which research is funded, designed, assessed anddistributed and the way medical practice is conceived, including: elimination of confidentialityagreements signed by researchers, disclosure of competing interests in publications, prohibitionon ghost authorships, public registration of research, open peer review, open access topublications, open submission processes, increased public funding of research, less reliance onguidelines, greater awareness of the collective nature of medical decisions and, most importantly,greater analytic training for medical professionals. The structural features of the medicalcommunity that uphold principles of diversity, transparency, and critical interaction need to beprotected and promoted in order to ensure the community retains its ability to produceknowledge. EBM is not just problematic because the particular assumptions upon which it isbased are wrongheaded. It is problematic because its proponents were not forthcoming withjustifications for these assumptions and for the standards of evidence proposed. Furthermore it isstill not clear what would be required to change those standards and critical discussion on thestandards has not been encouraged or thoughtfully engaged despite the availability of someappropriate venues for discussion within medicine.1. Remaining Problems and Future ResearchThe analysis provided in this dissertation certainly does not solve all of the problems related toevidence and medical decision-making. This is not a surprise given the complexity of theproblems. In what follows, I briefly outline a few key problems that remain as well as directionsfor future research.2391.1. UncertaintyThe uncertainty inherent in medical research and practice cannot be circumvented with rules,guidelines or hierarchies. And it will not be overcome even with the mechanisms of interactiveobjectivity just outlined. And yet embracing uncertainty poses a significant psychologicalchallenge for those who must make life and death decisions about the care of fellow humanbeings. There is a tension between the inevitable uncertainty of most clinical decisions and thedesire of health professionals to be certain about their treatments. Under these conditions,promises of certainty will always be appealing but must be resisted. As we saw in Chapter Five,Valerie Mik\u00e9 stresses the importance of two basic ethical principles of medical practice in her\"ethics of evidence\": make use of best evidence and retain a healthy appreciation for uncertaintyat all times. Uncertainty will not be diminished through false claims to certainty but throughgreater awareness of the limits of evidence. It is to this project that the medical and philosophicalcommunities should turn.1.2. Quantity of PublicationsOne of the many motivations for EBM was the increase in the number of biomedicalpublications. Given thousands of medical journals and hundreds of thousands of journal articlespublished every year, even a highly motivated physician will be unable to stay on top of all ofthe relevant articles in his or her area of specialization. The appeal of summarized guidelines anddigests is understandable in this situation. I have argued that guidelines and authoritative meta-analyses are dangerous because they limit the amount of critical interaction between physiciansand the original research data, and because they decrease the ability of physicians tocontextualize the results and assess social biases. This leaves physicians in a difficult situation.After all, there is no way to keep on top of the vast quantity of research being produced everyday. The challenges can be diminished somewhat through involvement of the health care teamand active involvement of the patient, as discussed in Chapter Seven, but the problem will not,and cannot, be entirely overcome.2401.3. Tendency to Prefer Rules over ReasoningThe original EBM working group said it best: \"People like quick and easy answers. Cookbookmedicine has its appeal. Critical appraisal involves additional time and effort, and may beperceived as inefficient and distracting from the real goal (to provide optimal care for patients).\"2Even with greater training in reasoning and argumentation, many health care professionals willnot be interested in doing all of the tedious thinking and critical evaluating required for goodmedical practice. It will sometimes be appealing to follow simplistic rules and pre-packagedguidelines. Beyond the requirement that physicians gain an appreciation for the basic principlesof reasoning through their medical education, I am not sure what can be done to change thisattitude.1.4. Ethics and EpistemologyEpistemological assumptions have an effect on the ethics of medical practice. For instance, agreat deal of attention has been paid to the concept of informed consent in bioethics. In thebioethical literature there are hundreds of articles offering careful articulations of the elements ofinformed consent (usually including disclosure, understanding, voluntariness and competence),the goal of informed consent (respect for autonomy and self-determination), as well as thoughtfularticulations of different decision-making models and guidelines for the physician-patientrelationship. The question too often glossed over in these otherwise thoughtful discussions iswhere the information comes from. There is a tendency to neglect the nature of the informationin informed consent. The assumption is that the facts are unproblematic. The focus is on howbest to convey the evidence, not on what evidence to convey or how to decide which evidence isworth conveying. Epistemological questions about the justifications of different sources ofevidence come into play as physicians choose which information is relevant to their patients.These epistemological choices thus affect the quality of patients' informed consent. As a result,epistemological claims have ethical import in the domain of medical practice. The \"ethics ofevidence\" is an important subject and one that has received scant attention thus far in the 2 Evidence Based Medicine Working Group, 2423.241bioethical literature. It is imperative that research projects are conducted on the ethics of medicalevidence.2. ThemesThere are three themes that run throughout this thesis. The first theme is the importance oftransparency: the need to be upfront about values. I provide empirical evidence of bias inmedical research and defend an account of interactive objectivity. Throughout, the emphasis ison the pervasive presence of values in knowledge-production. It is dangerous to pretend we havesuperseded these values by projecting a false image of objectivity. We have empirical, ethical,and epistemological reasons to value diversity, transparency and critical interaction.The second theme is the importance of community. Scientific activity requires theactivity of more than one individual. Medical research is no exception. Failure to attend to betterand worse ways of organizing scientific communities can leave them open to a variety of abuses.A comprehensive epistemology of medicine will include specific, practical and achievablecriteria for keeping communities sufficiently open. Relying on mechanisms that apply only toindividuals limits our ability to protect communities from the idiosyncratic views of the powerfulminority.The third theme is the importance of diversity, creativity and innovation. Whether it is themethodologies and theoretical frameworks proposed by researchers in complementary andalternative medicine or the diverse perspectives of philosophers such as myself addressing issuesin the domain of medicine, diverse perspectives allow for new critiques and novel proposals forchange and improvement. Interdisciplinary research and even research that brings together avariety of sub-disciplines within one discipline (such as bioethics, philosophy of medicine andsocial epistemology in this dissertation) provides vital new perspectives and fruitful new areas ofresearch. This theme is reinforced in both the content and structure of this project.3. Final WordsIn the Introduction to this dissertation I stated that I intended to produce a critical analysis ofcurrent standards of evidence that was as charitable to EBM as possible. To some readers it may242appear as though I have broken this promise. I do, after all, make a number of strong claimsabout the failings of EBM throughout the dissertation. In chapters four and five, in particular, Iargue that the fundamental assumptions of the movement are unjustified and, in some cases, justplain wrong. I suggest that EBM assigns unwarranted creedal value to the products of particularresearch methods. This comprehensive critical analysis does not, however, indicate a lack ofappreciation for the motivations behind EBM. I have a great deal of respect for the physicianswho first proposed EBM. Rather than complacently accepting a system rife with appeals toauthority and too slow to give up old, often harmful, habits, the members of the EBM workinggroup sought to bring about a more rational, more rigorous and more humane medical practice.While I think the details of their attempt to improve medicine were less than ideal, I appreciatethat EBM has forced physicians to talk about standards of evidence, the elements of clinicaldecision-making and methods of assessing clinical research. And while the movement hasshifted in recent years, for the short time that it emphasized critical thinking I think it providedan important perspective on the value of analytic skills for medical professionals. Further, whenyou look at the prominent physicians today who advocate for improvements to medicine, the oldguard of EBM are notable. For instance, it is Gordon Guyatt who drew attention to the value ofthe otherwise little-known n-of-1 method in research.3 It is members of the Cochranecollaboration who have most actively lobbied for a clinical trials registry.4 And it is DavidSackett and colleagues who have written the most comprehensive and provocative guide to theways in which research evidence can be biased by corporate interests.5Medical decisions are morally weighty: they are fraught with potential harms to innocentpatients. The weight of these decisions demands that physicians justify their decisions to thehighest standards. Appeals to authority are inadequate, and evidence - whether from clinicalresearch or patients' own experiences - should be an important factor in decision-making. Thatis not to say, however, that clinical research evidence should be the base of medical decision-making, nor that certain research methods, all else being equal, provide inherently betterevidence than others. And neither medical research nor medical practice will progress as long aswe leave these false assumptions in place. 3 Guyatt et al., \"Determining Optimal also credits Iain Chalmers in the article.243Evidence-based medicine is a term \"both evocative and trite.\"6 I have been astonished bythe rhetorical power of evidence-based practice, the language of which has spread far beyond therealm of health care. Even in the face of extensive critique, this movement has gainedmomentum all over the world. This is due in no small part to the easy marketability of the name,but it is more than this. People want to rely on facts, on objective truths, when making decisions.We all rest easier knowing that physicians have managed to beat back uncertainty - even if onlyfor a few moments until the next study comes out. The practice of medicine is challengingenough without second-guessing everything you do. But what is the price we pay for setting upseemingly objective procedures, hierarchies of research methods and rigid rules of practice?What is the price of false generalizability, false certainty, false objectivity?I think there are those who would argue that the price, however high, is worth payingbecause it is \"better than nothing\" and certainly a lot better than the paralysis of uncertainty. Idisagree. I do not think we progress in science, or any knowledge-seeking endeavour, when wesettle for alleged certainty over accuracy. We do not advance medical research by limiting thescope of what is investigated to that which fits the narrow received view of good science. We donot advance medical practice by requiring that physicians make decisions according to clinicaldecision-making rules that hide important, and often questionable, background assumptions. Wedo not advance human health by insisting that there is one correct way to practice medicine orone best method for investigating the complex, dynamic and often unpredictable facets ofdisease, illness and suffering. I have argued that the standards of evidence currently accepted inthe medical domain serve to diminish the objectivity, transparency and diversity of medicalresearch and, by extension, medical practice. As a result, EBM diminishes the chances forinnovation in medicine and negatively impacts the health and well-being of patients.Although this discussion has focused on medical standards of evidence, similar issues arepresent in such diverse fields as agriculture, ecosystem management and education. Wheneverpeople are tempted to apply procedural mechanisms rather than critical reasoning or wheneverthey are inclined to prefer a false sense of certainty over a true sense of uncertainty, there will bea market for evidence-based practice in its various guises. I join those in the medical communitywho lament the intellectual laziness behind these choices, and who are outraged at the resultingharm to patients. The social institutions of science - publication, funding, education, etc. - can 6 Daly, 11244be arranged in better and worse ways in terms of their ability to address this problem. Only bypaying attention to the epistemological weight of these social organizations and practices will webe able to address the most significant problems facing medical research and practice today. Andonly then will we be prepared to defend these social institutions and arrangements againstencroachment by commercial and other social interests.245BibliographyAchinstein, P. The Book of Evidence.
