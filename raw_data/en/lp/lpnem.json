The combination of science, philosophy and art that make chiropractic unique in the healing world has not changed. I try to live my life with a big picture mentality. In this case, my belief that all living things have an innate intelligence (or life force) which strives to maintain health and life guides me. If I can use the available science and develop the art and skills to locate and remove interference to that innate intelligence, it is the greatest service I can offer humanity. Dr. Scott Massengill on 30 Years of Straight Chiropractic Twenty Six years later I am even more excited about practicing Chiropractic than I was in the beginning, which might seem odd or uncommon to some. I wanted to be a chiropractor since I was 6 years old, long before I truly understood fully what it meant. So for me practicing Chiropractic is a calling, not just a job. Since that young age, I have learned a lot about what Chiropractic is and what it can do for my own health, but also for the health of my community and even our nation. The big picture answer to that statement keeps my passion for helping people to get well and BE well vibrant. When I read alarming statistics about the human and financial costs of chronic illness (read preventable by lifestyle). This one, for instance, \"By 2002 spending on prescription drugs alone had reached $3.5 billion per day, and by 2013 had surpassed $7 billion per day.\" I am shocked and highly motivated to reach as many people as possible to inspire them to make changes that will make a huge difference to the health and wellbeing of an individual and our nation. These changes can be as simple as making sure your Vitamin D levels are sufficient, or getting a 30 min. walk every day and certainly taking proper care of your spine. I am also deeply grateful for the opportunity to serve my community and to continue to earn the trust of each and every patient that crosses our threshold.
