However, you must have a valid [PEI Health Card](/en/information/health-pei/pei-health-card). How does a medical abortion work? A medical abortion is induced by taking two medications (Mifegymiso) that will end a pregnancy. After a health evaluation, you will take a pill called mifepristone that will block the hormone progesterone, which is necessary to sustain the pregnancy. After taking mifepristone: - changes will take place in the uterine lining; - the cervix (opening of the uterus or womb) softens; and - the muscle in the uterus becomes more sensitive to misoprostol, the second medication. After 24-48 hours later, four tablets of misoprostol is taken. After taking misoprostol: - bleeding and cramping, similar to a heavy menstrual period, will occur. Are there side effects? Some individuals may experience headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, chills or fatigue. If you have flu-like symptoms or abdominal pain for more than 24 hours after using misoprostol, call Sexual Health, Options & Reproductive Services at 1-844-365-8258 (toll-free). How effective is it? Early medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol is 95-98 percent effective. In less than 1 percent of cases, the pregnancy continues and a surgical abortion is necessary. Will it affect future pregnancies? Research has shown that having an abortion will not make it harder to get pregnant again and will not harm future pregnancies.
