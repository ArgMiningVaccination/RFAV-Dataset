Can you distinguish falsehood from fact? We live in an age of disinformation and misinformation, with rumors, fantastical notions, and conspiracy theories proliferating on social networks. More than three years into the pandemic, untruths about [COVID-19](/infectious-diseases/covid-19/) and the COVID-19 vaccine and booster continue to circulate. \"The internet has many advantages in that it puts information at our fingertips, but the problem in my opinion is that people aren't able to assess the reliability of the information they're receiving,\" says [Henry Bernstein, DO](https://faculty.medicine.hofstra.edu/2564-henry-bernstein), a [pediatrician](/pediatrician/guide/) and professor of pediatrics at Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra-Northwell in Hempstead, New York. \"That is where we run into difficulties in trying to gain people's trust.\" A recent nationwide survey of nearly 25,000 Americans by [The COVID States Project](https://www.covidstates.org/reports/health-and-political-misperceptions-in-the-us) (a multi-university research collaborative that includes Northwestern, Harvard, Northeastern, and Rutgers) found that roughly 1 in 5 respondents endorsed at least one COVID-19 vaccine misperception \u2014 such as the claim that vaccines may cause infertility, alter DNA, or contain microchip trackers. Another 45 percent didn't endorse any specific misperception but were uncertain about whether or not some of these statements might be true. Here's a look at some of the top COVID-19 vaccine myths making the rounds on social media, with comments from doctors distinguishing fact from falsehood. Top COVID-19 Questions: Should I Believe the Vaccine Skeptics on Social Media? Myth 1: The Vaccines Are Killing People When Buffalo Bills safety [Damar Hamlin collapsed](https://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-health/nfl-player-damar-hamlin-collapses-after-tackle-leads-to-cardiac-arrest/) during a live Monday Night Football broadcast in January 2023, anti-vaccine activists flooded social media with theories that the COVID-19 vaccine was to blame. The [Poynter Institute](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2023/no-damar-hamlins-mid-game-collapse-was-not-caused-by-the-covid-19-vaccine/), a nonprofit media institute and newsroom that provides fact-checking, rebutted the notion that the COVID-19 vaccine had anything to do with Hamlin's heart stopping. The cause, as confirmed by Hamlin and his doctors, was commotio cordis, a blunt force trauma injury to the heart that can lead to cardiac arrest. Yes, the COVID-19 vaccine has been connected to rare incidents of [myocarditis](/myocarditis/guide/) (inflammation of the heart), affecting 1 in 50,000 people in all age groups and 1 in 6,600 people (mainly males) age 16 to 19, according to [research published in JAMA Pediatrics](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2800744). But \"as far as we know now, the inflammation of the heart is temporary and resolves typically in a few days,\" says [Jill Foster, MD](https://med.umn.edu/bio/pediatrics-by-division/jill-foster), a pediatric infectious disease physician and a professor at the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis. \"That sounds scary, but we know that someone having COVID without that vaccine has an 11 times higher risk of developing myocarditis.\" Some people have had severe [allergic reactions](/allergies/) following vaccination, and a very small number have experienced complications such as blood clots, the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html) reports. Still, these incidents are rare. Myth 2: The Vaccines Were Developed Too Quickly to Be Safe Although the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was first reported at the end of 2019, scientists had already conducted years of research on related coronaviruses that cause [SARS](/pneumonia/guide/symptoms/) (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and developed vaccines to protect against these illnesses. The first COVID-19 vaccines, produced by [Pfizer (in conjunction with BioNTech)](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/coronavirus-covid-19-cber-regulated-biologics/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccines) and [Moderna](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/coronavirus-covid-19-cber-regulated-biologics/moderna-covid-19-vaccines) and authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, were a direct result of that research. \"The vaccines rely on a technology, mRNA [messenger RNA], that has been studied for over a decade, since at least the initial outbreaks of MERS,\" says [Jennifer Horney, PhD](https://www.udel.edu/faculty-staff/experts/jennifer-horney/), a professor of epidemiology and a core faculty member at the disaster research center at the University of Delaware in Newark. Dr. Horney says that researchers at Pfizer and Moderna conducted rigorous clinical trials of their vaccines involving tens of thousands of participants to evaluate both safety and effectiveness. Dr. Foster adds that in the United States, a reporting system is in place to identify any rare adverse (undesired) effects of COVID-19 inoculation. Out of an abundance of caution, other types of surveillance are also in place. \"This [reporting system] has been around for decades, but is really ramped up for these vaccines,\" she says. One of the main jobs of the [CDC's Immunization Safety Office](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/iso.html) is to discover if health issues that are reported by doctors, vaccine manufacturers, and the public are truly caused by the vaccine. Myth 3: The Vaccines Change Your DNA One in 10 respondents in the COVID States Project survey said they believed that COVID-19 vaccines can alter human DNA. Another 32 percent weren't sure whether or not this was true. The mRNA vaccines were created using genetic technology, but they do not affect a person's DNA in any way. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/how-they-work.html) explains that the mRNA in the vaccine gives cells instructions on how to produce a piece of a protein called a spike protein, which is similar to a protein on the surface of the coronavirus. This triggers the immune system to produce antibodies, which remain in the bloodstream ready to fight any future coronavirus infection. The mRNA from the vaccine never enters the nucleus of the cell and does not affect or interact with a person's DNA, the CDC affirms. Myth 4: The Vaccines Can Infect You With the Coronavirus None of the COVID-19 vaccines contain a live virus and do not carry a risk of causing disease in the immunized person. \"Getting the virus from the vaccine would be like getting a chicken from scrambled eggs,\" says Foster. \"It can't happen.\" [Hayley Gans, MD](https://profiles.stanford.edu/hayley-gans), a pediatric infectious-disease Stanford Medicine in Palo Alto, California, elaborates: \"The way these vaccines work is to expose your body to a protein that the virus has on its surface. ... You're not getting infected with a virus, and it can't turn into a virus.\" Myth 5: The Vaccines Can Cause Infertility Rumors have been flooding the internet for years that COVID-19 vaccines could cause infertility in women because of an ingredient that interferes with the development of the placenta. This was the top myth in the COVID States Project survey, with 13 percent of respondents affirming that it was true and 42 percent reporting that they were unsure. \"There are no data to support this hypothesis,\" says Dr. Bernstein. Myth 6: The Vaccines Contain Microchip Trackers The COVID States Project poll found that slightly more than 5 percent of those surveyed believed the statement \"COVID vaccines contain microchips,\" while 26 percent weren't sure. Conspiracy theorists have circulated a diagram online of what they say is a 5G chip inside the COVID vaccine. As [Popular Mechanics](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/a35122832/5g-conspiracy-chip-covid-19-vaccine-guitar-pedal/) pointed out, the diagram illustrates the inner workings of a guitar pedal. The rumors of microchipping via vaccine persist and feed into paranoia about shadowy plots created in secret by powerful entities. In the spring of 2023, [Missouri state legislators](https://www.governing.com/now/missouri-house-approves-anti-vaccine-measure) put forth a bill that would ban (nonexistent) microchips implanted into people without their consent. The CDC stresses that none of the COVID-19 vaccines contain software or microchips, and vaccines are not being used to track people. Myth 7: The Vaccines Contain Aborted Fetal Cells In the COVID States Project survey, 6 percent of respondents said they thought that vaccines carry aborted fetal cells, while 37 percent weren't sure. Some pharmaceutical companies did use fetal cell lines to develop and test their vaccines. Fetal cell lines, grown in a laboratory, were started with cells from elective abortions that occurred several decades ago, in the 1970s and '80s. Today's vaccines are now thousands of generations removed from the original fetal tissue. \"None of the COVID-19 vaccines use fetal cells derived from "}
