SP Detox Balance 10-28 day program HOW IT WORKS The SP Detox Balance program provides the body with additional nutritional support it may need to metabolize and expel toxins safely during each of the three phases of metabolic detoxification. PHASE I: UNLOCK The body transforms fat-soluble toxins to an \"unlocked\" state that is more water-soluble, and in many cases, more toxic than its original form. PHASE II: NEUTRALIZE The highly toxic substances produced in Phase I convert to non-toxic molecules and become even more water-soluble. PHASE III: ELIMINATE Water-soluble toxins leave cells, and the body eliminates them. SP Detox Balance delivers plant-based fiber to aid toxin elimination as well as delivers key nutrients.
