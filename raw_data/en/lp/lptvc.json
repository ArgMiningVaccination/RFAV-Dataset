Child 2003; 88:206-210 Aims: To document the immunogenicity and persistence of antibody to polyribosyl-ribitol phosphate (PRP) as well as the clinical protection against invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease in premature infants immunised at the routine schedule. Methods: Blood was obtained at 2, 5, 12, and 64 months of age from a cohort of prematurely born infants ( <32 weeks gestation). Anti-PRP antibody concentrations were compared with those of a con- trol cohort of infants born at full term and vaccinated at the same schedule. Hib vaccine failures occur- ring between October 1992 and October 2000 were reported by paediatricians through an active,prospective, national survey in the UK and Republic of Ireland. The number of prematurely born chil- dren with vaccine failure was compared with the corresponding number born at term. Results: Twenty seven prematurely born infants were followed to 5 years of age. Compared with term infants they had a significantly lower geometric mean concentration of anti-PRP antibody and/or a sig-nificantly lower proportion above one or both of the conventional protective antibody concentrations(0.15 and 1.0 \u00b5g/ml) at all ages. A total of 165 cases of invasive Hib disease were identified overeight years of national surveillance. Eighteen were premature (<37 weeks); approximately 12 wouldbe expected. The relative risk of UK premature infants developing disease compared with term infants was 1.5 (95% CI 0.9 to 2.6).Conclusions: Premature infants develop lower antibody concentrations than term infants following Hib conjugate vaccination. Premature infants may also have an increased risk of clinical vaccine failure, butinterpretation is limited by the small number of premature infants developing invasive Hib disease overeight years of national surveillance. Overall, vaccination with Hib conjugate vaccines affords a highlevel of protection to premature babies. Infants born prematurely are immunised according to chronological age without taking account of their gestational age or birth weight. Among the reasons for this policy are that premature infants may be at increased risk of certain vaccine preventable diseases such as pertussis and thatvarying the schedule for certain groups may result inconfusion and a lower rate of vaccine coverage. Studies with diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccines also suggest that premature infants can achieve adequate antibodyconcentrations. 1-3 For other vaccines the data are variable. D'Angio and colleagues2and O'Shea and colleagues,4for example, docu- mented suboptimal antibody responses to doses of polio vac-cines, while others have shown adequate responses. 5-8Al o w e r seroconversion rate following hepatitis B vaccine has also beendocumented, 9but not universally.10-13 With regard to the Haemophilus inflenzae type b (Hib) conju- gate vaccines, Munoz et al quantied antibody responses to two doses of PRP-OMP given at 2 and 4 months of age in 36premature infants and found only 53% developed a concentra-tion >1 \u00b5g/ml compared with 92% in term infants. 14 Washburn et alreached a similar conclusion with 22 preterm infants who had chronic lung disease and received PRP-OMP(55% >1 \u00b5g/ml). 15However, a study with the conjugate HbOC revealed little difference in responses between 16 preterminfants (all <29 weeks) and an unmatched group of terminfants. 2Using PRP-T at a schedule of 2, 4, and 12 months of age, Kristensen et alshowed prematurely born infants (27-36 weeks gestation) to have a lower response after two but notafter three doses of vaccine. 16At a 2, 3, and 4 month schedule, Robinson et al found that infants <32 weeks gestation, who had not received dexamethasone, achieved a similar GMC tothat of term infants. 17One group has addressed the long term persistence of anti- body after Hib immunisation. Sixteen premature infants who had received four doses of HbOC in infancy were evaluated at 3 and 7 years of age. Compared with age matched term controls they had a lower Hib antibody concentration at bothages. It was concluded that continued clinical follow up ofcohorts of preterm children might help clarify their suscepti- bility to Hib disease in later childhood. 18 19 In this study we sought to follow to school age a cohort of prematurely born infants vaccinated with PRP-T (ActHib, Pasteur Merieux) according to the UK accelerated schedule of three doses at 2, 3, and 4 months of age. As part of a national surveillance study of invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease in childhood, we were also able to determine whether prematureinfants were more likely to present with clinical vaccine failure than their term counterparts. METHODS Immunogenicity studies Parents of premature infants ( <32 weeks gestation) who were inpatients of the Special Care Baby Unit of the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford were approached between February 1991 and April 1992. They were provided with verbal and written infor-mation about the study and formal consent was obtained.

PRP-T was given by separate injection from DTP at 2, 3, and 4 months ofage. OPV was given concurrently. There were no further doses of Hib vaccine given. Blood was obtained by venepuncture at 2 months of age (prior to the rst dose of Hib vaccine), at 5 months of age (one month after the third dose), at 12 months of age, and again at5 years of age. A local anaesthetic cream (EMLA, Astra Phar-maceuticals) was applied prior to venesection on all occasionsexcept at 2 months of age. The blood was centrifuged on return to the laboratory and serum stored at 20\u00b0C until serological tests were performed. Anti-PRP antibodies were quantied using an enzyme linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique describedpreviously. 20 For comparison, data are presented from healthy term infants who were born at the same hospital and were enrolled in parallel studies of the immunogenicity and persistence ofantibody to PRP-T. One hundred and seven infants wereenrolled in 1990 and received three doses at 2, 3, and 4 months of age. Blood was obtained at 2, 5, 12, and 72 months of age; the results have been reported previously. 21 Invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease in childhood study This study commenced in October 1992, coincident with the introduction of the Hib conjugate vaccine into the routineimmunisation schedule in the UK and the Republic of Ireland(ROI). In the UK, infants <12 months of age were offeredPRP-T at 2, 3, and 4 months of age and in the ROI, HbOC wasoffered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. No booster dose of Hibvaccine was included in either schedule. Surveillance for inva-sive Haemophilus influenzae disease in children was performed under the auspices of the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit(BPSU) of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health inassociation with microbiologists and public health physicians.The BPSU has a programme of active surveillance for rarepaediatric conditions. More than 90% of paediatricians routinely report to the BPSU on the report card sent to themon a monthly basis. 22The methodology has been detailed previously.21Briefly, consultant paediatricians were requested to report any child with invasive H influenzae disease (isolation ofH influenzae from a normally sterile site or a positive Hib antigen test combined with a clinical picture compatible with invasive Hib disease). The paediatrician was then sent a ques-tionnaire requesting clinical, demographic, and laboratoryinformation. Vaccination details were obtained from the gen- eral practitioner or if necessary from an administrator at the child health immunisation computer record centre. The localconsultant microbiologist was contacted and asked to sendthe isolate to the Haemophilus Reference Unit in Oxford forverication and typing by standard slide agglutination andPCR techniques. 23 In the ROI an investigator telephoned all laboratories serv- ing paediatric hospitals every two weeks to maximise ascertainment. Isolates were sent to Oxford via the pathologydepartment at the Waterford Regional Hospital. For the purposes of this report a true vaccine failure (TVF) was dened as invasive Hib disease occurring more than one week after three doses had been given to a child when youngerthan 1 year of age. Statistics Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (SPSS Inc.,Chicago) and Epi Info version 5. Age and birth weights arereported as median (range). Anti-PRP antibodies wereconverted by logarithmic transformation and reported as geo-metric mean concentration (GMC) with 95% condenceintervals. Concentrations <0.15 \u00b5g/ml were allocated a value of 0.08 for the purposes of calculations. Antibody concentra- tions of term and preterm infants were compared using the ttest for independent samples. All proportions were comparedusing the 2test (Yates's corrected) or Fisher's exact test. Analysis of the influence of various neonatal factors on antibody concentrations in premature infants was performed using stepwise multiple regression analysis. The following factors were included: gestational age, breast feeding, transfu-sion with blood or plasma, and treatment with corticosteroidsor supplemental oxygen. It was assumed that 7.1% of infants are born at <37 weeks gestation, 3.2% at <35 weeks, and 1.7% at <32 weeks (for comparison with the immunogenicity study), 24that the cover- age for vaccination of premature infants was 93% (that is, the same as term infants), and that the age specic attack rate was the same for both term and preterm infants. The latter was assumed, as there are no published data comparing the attackrates of Hib disease in term infants with those bornprematurely. Data from the Immunisation Division, Commu- nicable Diseases Surveillance Centre, London indicate that the proportion of prematurely born infants completing threedoses of vaccine by 6 months of age was not lower than theproportion of term infants completing three doses by 6months of age (personal communication, Marie Rush). Theannual national birth rates were provided by the Ofce ofNational Statistics, London. The annual UK birth cohort varied from 700 200 to 781 000 over the period of the study. All studies were approved by the Central Oxford Research Ethics Committee. RESULTS Immunogenicity studies Forty one premature infants were recruited. The mediangestational age (GA) was 30 weeks (range 23-32) and 16 (39%) were <28 weeks gestation. The median birth weight was 1.26 kg (range 0.62-2.17); 49% were male. Fifty nine percent received one or more blood transfusions, 46% plasma(63% blood or plasma), and 12% received corticosteroids (all were <25 weeks gestation at birth). Culture proven sepsis was documented in 24% of infants, most commonly due to coagu-lase negative staphylococci. Data were available on 40 premature infants at 2 and 5 months, 26 at 12 months, and 27 at 64 months of age. Reasonsfor the drop in numbers included children moving out of thearea, insufcient blood available for testing, and refusal to have a blood test. Risk factors for a lower Hib antibody concentration at 2 months of age were lower gestational age, prior blood transfu-sion, and sepsis. When these were included in a stepwise lin-ear regression model only gestational age was signicantlyrelated to antibody concentration ( r= 0.38, p = 0.03). There was no statistically signicant influence of any factor (includ-ing gestational age) on antibody concentrations at 5, 12, and64 months of age. Table 1 details the Hib antibody concentrations and propor- tions of infants with concentrations <0.15 and <1.0 \u00b5g/ml. For comparison, the results are also shown for infants born atterm who were followed in a parallel study. Clinical vaccine failure study During the eight year period 1 October 1992 to 1 October 2000,165 true vaccine failures were reported to the BPSU study.Twelve of these occurred in the ROI. Eighteen infants (16 UK, two ROI) were born prematurely (<37 weeks gestation); 10 were less than 35 weeks gestation.The median gestational age of premature infants was 34weeks (range 29-36). The median age at Hib disease was 20months (range 5-68) and there was a median time period of15 months (range 0.6-63) between the third dose of Hib vac-cine and disease. Ten premature infants (56%) presented withmeningitis, three (17%) with epiglottitis, two (11%) withbacteraemia, and one each with pneumonia, septic arthritis,Hib vaccination in infants born prematurely 207 www.archdischild.comand cellulitis. Sixty seven per cent were male. Two children died (11%). In contrast, for true vaccine failures born at term(n = 147), the median age of disease was 27 months (range 4-70) (p > 0.1 versus premature infants) and the time period between third vaccine dose and disease was 22 months (range0.4-65 months) (p > 0.1 versus premature infants). Themajor clinical presentations of term infants included (21%), bacteraemia (12%) and per cent were male. There werethree deaths (2%, p = 0.09 versus premature infants). The distribution of premature to term infants among TVF over the study period was as follows: 1 v3 (1993), 1 v13 (1994), 3 v21 (1995), 3 v20 (1996), 1 v20 (1997), 3 v12 (1998), 4 v26 (1999), and 2 v32 (2000). Subdividing the premature TVF by the age of a hypothetical Hib booster dose (given at 12-15 months of age) and adding one week to develop a protective antibody response, revealsthat 14 cases (78%) (12 in UK) were >12.25 months of age and 13 cases (72%) >15.25 months of age at the time of dis- ease. One of the two deaths was in a child older than the ageof a hypothetical booster dose. The proportion of TVF among vaccinated premature infants in the UK was not statistically signicantly greater than theproportion of TVF among vaccinated term infants: <37 weeks,relative risk (RR) 1.5 CI p = 0.14); <35 weeks,RR 1.7 (95% CI 0.8 to 3.5; p = 0.12); or <32 weeks, RR 1.6 (95% CI 0.5 to 4.3; p = 0.2). DISCUSSION In this study we have shown that premature infants born at <32 weeks gestation achieve lower anti-PRP antibody concentrations following Hib vaccination and lower propor- tions above one or both of the conventional protective concen- trations than infants who are born at term. In the absence ofclinical data it may be reasonable to conclude therefore, thatthese infants are at a signicantly greater risk of invasive Hib disease and should be offered a booster dose. A booster dose for premature infants might be considered more important inthe UK and Ireland, where a booster dose is not routinelyadministered to any child, in contrast to the practice in mostother developed countries. Through a unique national, active,prospective, enhanced surveillance study we have been able toexamine the clinical signicance of these lower antibody con- centrations. This is the rst published study to address thisissue. The surveillance data indicate a trend to a higher relativerisk (1.5) of clinical vaccine failure in premature infants (<37weeks) compared with term infants, but with a 95%condence interval which extends from 0.9 to 2.6. For prema-ture infants <32 weeks gestation (the group investigated in the immunogenicity study) the relative risk is 1.6 (0.5-4.3).Neither gure reaches statistical signicance, perhaps reflect-ing the small number of cases. These data have been generatedfrom eight years of national surveillance in which approxi-mately 5.5 million infants have received three doses of Hibconjugate vaccine and been followed for clinical vaccinefailure. It is unlikely that similar data could be or will be gen-erated from any other population. Our immunogenicity data are generally consistent with those of other published studies. Kristensen et almeasured the response to two doses of PRP-T at 2 and 4 months of age and showed a lower concentration in premature infants, but con-centrations comparable to term infants after a third dose at 12 months of age. 16Using PRP-T at the UK schedule, Robinson et almeasured a GMC of 4.63 \u00b5g/ml in premature infants who had not received dexamethasone therapy and 0.51 \u00b5g/ml in those who had received dexamethasone.17There was no group of term infants for comparison. This GMC is higher than that found in our study (2.73 at 5 months of age) which may beaccounted for by the later age of vaccination in the study ofRobinson et al, and the fact that 12% of our cohort also received dexamethasone during their neonatal course. With a different Hib conjugate vaccine (HbOC) and schedule (fourdoses at 2, 4, 6, and 12-19 months of age), 16 preterm infantswere followed to 3 and 7 years of age. 21 81 9After three doses of vaccine the GMC of preterm and term infants was equivalent, but on follow up the GMC for premature infants was signi-cantly lower than that of term infants: 0.99 versus 3.06 \u00b5g/ml at 3 years of age, and 1.41 versus 3.21 at 7 years of age. The fourth dose of vaccine may account for the persistence ofhigher antibody concentrations of antibody in this study whencompared with ours. The difference in antibody concentra-tions between preterm and term infants is consistent with ourstudy. Our study allows us to consider the risk of vaccine failure in premature infants in several ways: relative to conventionalantibody surrogates of protection, relative to the antibodyconcentrations in term infants and relative to the clinical pro- tection achieved in term infants. As judged by conventional surrogates of protection, premature infants are at greatlyTable 1 Serum Hib antibody concentrations and proportions with concentrations <0.15 \u00b5g/ml and 1.0 \u00b5g/ml, by age, for premature infants and term infants Median age (months)Premature 3.5 1.1 (0.16 to 0.27) (0.31 to 0.44) (40) (90) (40) (90) (40) (90) 5 2.73 4.60 5 1 33* 12 5.3 2.6 (1.63 to 4.58) (3.51 to 6.04) (40) (105) (40) (105) (40) (105) 12 0.34* 0.88 23* 6 77 57 3.7 1.4 (0.20 to 0.56) (0.66 to 1.17) (26) (95) (26) (95) (26) (95) 64 0.24 41 81 (0.16 to 0.37) (27) (27) (27) 72 0.51 32 71 1.3 1.1 (0.31 to 0.85) (59) (59) (59) *p<0.05 versus term infants at same age; p=0.08 versus term infants at 5 months of age, p<0.05 versus term infants at 72 months of age.208 Heath, McVernon, 77%, and 81% of them had antibody concentrations less than 1.0 \u00b5g/ml at 5, 12, and 64 months of age respectively. Despite this, over an eight yearperiod only 16 UK infants (out of more than 380 000vaccinated premature infants) actually developed invasive Hib disease. When related to infants born at term, preterm infantsalso appear to be at greater risk of disease. For example,proportions less than 1.0 \u00b5g/ml were 33 versus 12% at 5 months (ratio 2.6), 77 versus 57% at 12 months (1.4), and 81%at 64 months versus 71% at 72 months (1.1). The latter com-parison actually underestimates the difference betweenpreterm and term infants as term infants were bled a medianof eight months after preterm infants. Finally, relative to theclinical protection achieved in term infants premature infants have an increased risk of vaccine failure but one that does not achieve statistical signicance. It is noteworthy that the age ofdisease presentation is also earlier in preterm infants than interm infants. This is consistent with the hypothesis that theantibody response of preterm infants is lower and theduration of protection may therefore be shorter. It is not surprising that the conventional serological corre- lates of protection are poorly predictive of clinical protectionafter conjugate vaccination. These concentrations were de-rived from a non-vaccinated population (0.15 \u00b5g/ml) and from a population vaccinated with an unconjugated PRP vaccine(1.0\u00b5g/ml). 25In contrast to unconjugated PRP vaccination, immunological memory is induced following conjugate vacci- nation. This has been documented in term as well as preterminfants. 16 26Low anti-PRP antibody concentrations following Hib conjugate vaccine may therefore be associated with higherthan expected clinical protection. This can be inferred fromthe high protective efcacy shown in the Finnish and Icelan-dic populations where the least immunogenic conjugate vaccine, PRP-D, was used. 27 28Indeed, we have shown that in the UK population where the absence of a booster dose results in relatively low antibody concentration through childhood,clinical protection actually remains high. 21 Another possible mechanism for the apparent clinical protection of premature infants despite low anti-PRP antibodyconcentrations is herd immunity\u2014that is, these infants areless exposed to Hib as a result of widespread vaccination in thechildhood population. A reduction in pharyngeal carriage of Hib in UK children has been documented. 29Herd immunity in the UK may also be inferred from the reduction in Hib disease in infants too young to be vaccinated or only partlyvaccinated. 30 It is conceivable that ascertainment of vaccine failures in this study was incomplete despite the fact that multiplesources were employed. 30However, for the purposes of this particular analysis one would need to postulate that prema-ture infants with Hib vaccine failure are specically under-reported. This seems unlikely. Consideration must also begiven to the possibility that in practice, premature infants might actually be vaccinated at an older chronological agethan term infants and therefore have better antibodyresponses than those achieved in this study which strictly fol-lowed the 2, 3, and 4 month schedule. However, data from theImmunisation Division, Communicable Diseases SurveillanceCentre, London show that the proportion of prematurely borninfants was not lower than the proportion of term infantscompleting three doses of vaccine by 6 months of age(personal communication, Marie Rush). The assumption was also made that the pre-vaccine attack rates in premature andterm infants are similar. A review of the published literaturedid not nd any data on the risk of Hib disease in prematureinfants. A recent analysis of the risk of pneumococcal diseasein premature infants suggests they have an increasedsusceptibility. 31It is conceivable therefore, that the small increased risk of Hib disease seen in our study simply reflects an increased background risk of premature infants to Hib dis-ease per se rather than an increased risk of vaccine failure. Itshould also be noted that the immunogenicity data presented derives from a relatively small group of very premature infantswith a median gestational age of 30 weeks (all <32 weeks gestation) who may not be representative of all prematurebabies. It is also likely that less premature infants will have agood antibody response to Hib vaccination that may not besignicantly different from that of term infants. As indicatedabove, despite these antibody concentrations, even this verypremature group are not signicantly over represented amongthe vaccine failures (RR 1.6 (0.5-4.3), p = 0.2). Further information on the apparent protection derived from Hib conjugate vaccination in premature infants despitetheir lower antibody concentrations might be derived fromanalysis of antibody avidity or responses to booster doses. Thiswas not done in our study and has not yet been assessed in UKpremature infants. If a booster were to be introduced in the UK at 12-15 months of age (to coincide with the measles/mumps/rubelladose) with the intention of preventing disease in these older,prematurely born infants, then over 380 000 extra doseswould need to have been administered to prematurely borninfants during this eight year period in order to preventdisease in 12 infants. This assumes that a booster dose wouldhave prevented disease in these individuals. Conclusions This study provides both laboratory and clinical data on thecurrent relative risk of vaccine failure of premature infantswhen vaccinated with the Hib conjugate vaccine at the UKschedule. The study indicates that premature infants ( <32 weeks gestation) have signicantly lower antibody concentra-tions than term infants but that despite this, they achieve veryhigh levels of clinical protection. The numbers of cases of vac-cine failure are small and the condence intervals for the rela-tive risks indicate that the risk for premature infants mayextend from 0.9 to 2.6. It is possible that with changes in neo-natal practice, such as the increased use of steroids, 17or of national recommendations, such as the introduction of acellular pertussis/Hib combinations,32that Hib antibody responses in infants born prematurely may be furthersuppressed and their risk of clinical disease may increase. Continued surveillance is vital in addressing the clinical relevance of such issues to Hib immunisation in the UK. Thendings of this study also have implications for thevaccination and surveillance of premature infants following the introduction of the newer conjugate vaccines.

ARCHIVIST ........................................................................................................ of syndrome The relationship between genotype and phenotype in Prader-Willi syndrome has not been completely delineated. Clinical diagnosis is based on a list of major or minor criteriapresent in the neonatal period and in later childhood, adolescence, and adult life. Genetic diagnosis is dependent on methylation analysis at the SNURF/SNRPN locus. A study based on the former Anglia and Oxford Health Region (J Whittington and colleagues. ( J Med Genet 2002; 39:926-32) has provided more data about the relationship between clinical features and genetic diagnosis. The study included 103 people with positive genetic tests for Prader-Willi syndrome. Sixty- one of these were from a population based sample within the region and 42 from other regions). There were 19 with negative genetic tests but positive clinical criteria, and 10 fromthe population study with neither appropriate clinical criteria nor positive genetic tests plus22 controls with learning disorders of other aetiologies. Four neonatal criteria were invariably present when genetic testing was positive; they were poor suck, feeding problems, floppiness at birth, and weak cry or inactivity. Hypogonadism was also an invariable accompaniment of the genetic diagnosis. When all learning-disabledsubjects were considered the combination of poor suck at birth, weak cry or inactivity ininfancy, decreased vomiting, and thick saliva correctly distinguished between Prader-Willisyndrome and other diagnoses in 92% of cases. No combination of clinical features, however,predicted a positive genetic diagnosis with certainty. When there is no information aboutneonatal features the most discriminatory clinical features are hypogonadism, small handsand feet, thick saliva, more than usual stubbornness, and insensitivity to hot and cold.
