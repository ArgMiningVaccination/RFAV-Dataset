INTR ODUCTION The po wer of biotechnology no w allo ws scientists to use plants as \u00d2 factories \u00d3 to pr oduce a wide range of ne w products. O ne of the most ex citing dev elopments is the ability to use plants to pr oduce human pharmaceuticals useful in tr eating cancer , cardiovascular disease, infectious diseases and other conditions. D evelopers hope this technology will lead to safer , more abundant and mor e affordable ne w medicines. This po werful ne w application of biotechnology also raises questions about whether plant- made pharmaceuticals pose risks to humans and the envir onment, particularly if they ar e produced in plants that also serv e as food or feed cr ops. To shed light on these issues, the P ew Initiativ e on F ood and B iotechnology , the U. S. F ood and D rug Administration, and the Cooperativ e State R esearch, Education and E xtension Service of the U. S. D epartment of Agricultur e co-sponsor ed a two-day confer ence entitled Pharming the F ield.This ev ent br ought together a br oad range of inter ested parties to share information and exchange vie ws on the potential benefits and risks associated with plant-made pharmaceuticals and to r eview the curr ent laws and r egulatory policies that apply to these plants. The vie ws that emer ged fr om the confer ence ar e captur ed her e to demonstrate the br oad diversity of perspectiv es and to pr ovide context for futur e dialogue on this v ery important issue. I t should be noted that the ex changes among participants r eflect only their opinions and not necessarily those of the sponsoring or ganizations.

Deputy Commissioner U.S. F ood and D rug Administration Colien H efferan, P h.D. Administrator Cooperativ e State R esearch, Education and E xtension S ervice P 01 The P ew Initiativ e on F ood and B iotechnology , the F ood and D rug Administration (FDA) and the Cooperativ e State R esearch, Education and E xtension S ervice of the U nited S tates Department of Agricultur e (USDA) held a wor kshop in J uly 2002 in Washington, D.C., to explor e an emer ging sector of the biotechnology industry that inv olves engineering plants with genes that allo w them to pr oduce pharmaceutical substances. The ev ent dr ew government of ficials, biotechnology and food industry r epresentativ es, scientists, patient adv ocates, envir onmentalists and members of public inter est gr oups. Discussions addressed why some companies believ e these ne w types of transgenic plants, often r eferred to as \u00d2 pharma plants,\u00d3 could pr ovide a sour ce of biological material curr ently in demand for a ne w generation of medicines. P articipants also focused on whether the technology poses risks to humans, animals and the envir onment, particularly if drugs ar e produced in plant v arieties that also serv e as food or feed cr ops. Finally, participants consider edwhat steps industry and go vernment r egulators ar e taking to minimiz e these risks and whether these actions ar e sufficient. Scientists fr om biotechnology companies described their ongoing ef forts to dev elop genetically modified (GM) cr ops\u00d1corn is a leading candidate though inv estigators also ar e experimenting with other species, including tobacco\u00d1capable of pr oducing specific human antibodies, enzymes and other biological material for a class of drugs kno wn as biologics. I n most cases, the material would hav e to be extracted fr om the plant befor e it could be used in a drug. Scientists once envisioned dev eloping drugs that could be administer ed thr ough the consumption of raw plants serving as \u00d2 edible v accines.\u00d3 H owever, most scientists no w believ e that in or der to assur e dose consistency , all pharma plant pr oducts will r equire some lev el of pr ocessing. Currently, biologics, which account for an incr easing per centage of pharmaceuticals, ar e manufactur ed with material gr own in mammalian cell cultur es. Some industry observ ers warn, however, that pr oduction via mammalian cells is so costly and inef ficient that without the dev elopment of alternativ e production systems, pr omising ne w treatments for a range of conditions may nev er make it to mar ket.EXECUTIVE SUMMAR Y P 02Though ther e are not y et any FDA-appr oved drugs containing material fr om pharma plants, presentations at the confer ence r evealed a gr owing inter est in dev eloping alternativ es to mammalian cells systems has spurr ed industry to mo ve rapidly to ward commer cial applications of pharma plants, with a v ariety of field tests and clinical trials no w underway . This quickening pace has heightened inter est from the food industry , envir onmental gr oups and some consumer advocates who worry about ho w these cr ops will be \u00d2 contained \u00d3 so that they ar e not inadv ertently consumed b y humans or animals or allo wed to spr ead into the surrounding ecosystem. F or example, discussions at the confer ence focused on what the government should r equire and what industry is curr ently doing to pr event cr ops engineer ed to pr oduce pharmaceuticals fr om spontaneously br eeding with v arieties intended for food or feed. One USDA official indicated that the agency has r esponded to public concerns b y instituting requirements for pharma plant cultiv ation that ar e mor e rigor ous than those applied to other GM v arieties and that, unlike many other GM cr ops, pharma plants will always be under USDA regulatory scrutiny . Officials fr om USDA and FDA also spoke of ho w they will coordinate their o versight ef forts.*One reason the agencies ar e seeking close cooperation is that, in addition to assessing the safety and ef ficacy of plant-deriv ed drugs, FDA will set its own standar ds for field operations, as it plans to giv e field cultiv ation of pharma plants the same sort of r egulatory scrutiny that it applies to conv entional drug manufacturing facilities. Critics of the status quo focused on what they vie w as a lack of transpar ency that inhibits independent ef forts to assess whether pharma plants ar e a thr eat to humans, animals or the envir onment. F or example, some participants noted that USDA-issued permits for pharma plant field tests rar ely disclose what substance the plant has been engineer ed to produce or ho w much acr eage is under cultiv ation. This spar ked a discussion about the tension betw een the desir e for public disclosur es that would facilitate an independent evaluation of potential health and envir onmental hazar ds and a company \u00d5s right, or ev en its fiduciary duty , to pr otect confidential business information. In her keynote addr ess, former FDA Commissioner J ane H enney noted that the intr oduction of pharma plants would benefit fr om a frank and open airing of all concerns, no matter ho w controversial. S he cautioned against appr oaching this ne w technology with either \u00d2blind faith\u00d3 or \u00d2irrational fear .\u00d3 Rather , she advised all stakeholders to seek common gr ound through an objectiv e, evidence-based assessment of the issues. *In September 2002, USDA and FDA jointly published a draft \u00d2 guidance document \u00d3 outlining what they will be seeking fr om pr oducers of \u00d2 drugs, biologics, and medical devices deriv ed from bioengineer ed plants.\u00d3 The document is nternet at: http://www .fda.go v/cber/gdlns/bioplant.htm. P 03The reason some companies ar e engineering plants with genes that allo w them to pr oduce drugs is r elatively simple. Agrowing number of cutting edge tr eatments that tar get a range of conditions such as arthritis, herpes, cancer and infectious diseases r equire human and viral proteins\u00d1mainly antibodies but also enzymes and other biological material\u00d1 that must be deriv ed from living systems. C urrently, drug makers synthesiz e this material in animal cell cultur es (Chinese hamster o vary cells ar e commonly used) that must be carefully nurtur ed inside sophisticated fermentation v ats or \u00d2bior eactors.\u00d3 But as Richar d McCloskey , vice pr esident of medical r esearch at the biotechnology firm Centocor , explained, ther e is concern in the industry that this system may hav e two fundamental limitations. F irst, pr oduction of high-quality biological material via mammalian cells is v ery expensiv e and r esults in drugs that may be too costly for patients to af ford. Second, ther e are not enough of these bior eactors av ailable to meet existing, much less future, demand for drug pr oduction. For example, M itch H ein, pr esident and dir ector of E picyte P harmaceutical I nc., pointed out that four pharmaceutical pr oducts that r equire human antibodies curr ently consume about seventy-fiv epercent of today \u00d5s mammalian cell fermentation capacity . Hein noted that a review of therapies currently in the dev elopment pipeline r eveals that b y 2010 ther e could be 30 or mor e antibody- dependent pr oducts competing for these same facilities. I n an effort to deal with this dilemma, Centocor\u00d5 s McCloskey said his firm, and other pharmaceutical companies as w ell, are exploring whether deriving the raw materials they need fr om genetically engineer ed plants could lo wer costs while simultaneously boosting manufacturing capacity . \u00d2Lower costs for me as a clinician ar e potentially translated into mor e affordable pr oducts for mor e patients sooner rather than later ,\u00d3 he said. Pharmaceutical pr oducts deriv ed from transgenic plants hav e yet to r each the mar ket. McCloskey noted that while the field is pr ogressing rapidly enough that some plant- derived products ar e in early-stage clinical trials, ther e are not y et enough data to definitiv ely state that GM plants will pr ovide a viable alternativ e to mammalian cells. With high costs and insufficient capacity thr eatening to slo w the r ollout of po werful ne w medicines, M cCloskey believ es that companies must aggr essively seek out alternativ e systems.PLANTING THE FUTURE: The B enefits and R easons for U sing P lants to P roduce P harmaceuticals1PANEL P 04\u00d2If the patients for whom these biologics ar e intended can \u00d5t pay for ...the drugs...and the healthcar e system r efuses to do so, ther e will be no r esearch or dev elopment with these agents,\u00d3 he said. Underscoring H ein\u00d5s point about pr oduction capacity , McCloskey estimated that fourteen percent of new medical tr eatments no w in clinical trials ar e biologics, i.e., therapies such as antibodies or other pr oteins that no w must be deriv ed almost ex clusiv ely fr om mammalian cells. F urthermor e, he expects that per centage to gr ow, but he worries that a bottleneck may soon occur in the drug pipeline when companies seek to scale-upproduction fr om clinical trials to general distribution. Unlike conv entional pharmaceutical companies, M cCloskey explained, most biotech companies outsour ce production. They hav e valid concerns, he noted, about whether the manufactur ers they depend upon possess the capacity to fulfill their needs\u00d1and whether patients andtheir insurance companies would be willing to pay the price r equired to r ecoup the costs of building additional facilities.

Adapted from a slide prepared by Richard McClosky, Centocor, Inc .\u00d2For instance, if ther e is a demand for 2.5 million liters of mammalian cell capacity , even at a lo w estimate of $2 million for each kiloliter , that\u00d5s $6 billion needed for ne w [facilities] to make these biologics,\u00d3 he said. McCloskey observ ed that industry publications ar e \u00d2replete with alarms \u00d3 about a pending shortfall in production, with estimates that \u00d220 to 50\u00d3 pr oducts could be delay ed by a lack of manufacturing capacity . Building a ne w mammalian cell bior eactor facility takes about fiv e to seven years at an average cost of about $600 million. I t also r equires an expectation that the inv estment can be recouped thr ough drug sales, and this makes transgenic plants an attractiv e alternativ e, he said. McCloskey said pr oducing 1000 kilograms of human antibodies in hamster cells costs about $105 to $175 per gram. Transgenic plants might be able to pr oduce the same amount for $15 to $190 per gram. H e explained that the wide range in cost estimates for production via transgenic plants indicates that plants might not pr ovide savings in all instances but that in some cases, the savings could be substantial. F or example, McCloskey cited figur es sho wing that it costs $80 million to pr oduce 300 kilograms of antibodies in mammalian cells, but genetically modified corn might be capable of pr oducing the same amount for $10 million. P 061PANEL\u00d2If the patients for whom these biologics ar e intended can \u00d5t pay for ...the drugs...and the healthcar e system r efuses to do so, ther e will be no research or dev elopment with pr oducing pharmaceutical substances in transgenic plants could allo w companies to rapidly boost capacity in r esponse to incr eased demand, since they could simply cultiv ate mor e acreage, as opposed to constructing ne w bior eactor facilities. That is particularly important, he said, because some biologics under dev elopment will be intended for \u00d2hundr eds of thousands of patients \u00d3 or might be administer ed in lar ge doses or , in the case of chr onic af flictions such as arthritis, the therapy could be r equired for years. All of these factors would incr ease demand for significant quantities of raw material. \u00d2It may be naiv e, but I conceiv e that the husbandry principles for 100,000 acr es of a plant are not much dif ferent than for 1,000 acr es of a plant,\u00d3 he said, \u00d2 where I can tell y ou that going fr om an 8 liter (mammalian cell) r eactor to an 800 liter or a 1,000 liter r eactor is not sometimes so simple.\u00d3 Centocor , McCloskey noted, is particularly inter ested in engineering corn with genetic material that will allo w it to pr oduce the substances the company needs. Transgenic corn, he said, appears capable of pr oducing pharmaceutical-grade material in a way that will allow extraction and purification \u00d2 using v ery simple methods.\u00d3 According to M cCloskey , \u00d2the simpler the purification scheme, the gr eater the savings.\u00d3 Overall, M cCloskey said answ ers to questions about the therapeutic quality of biological material extracted fr om transgenic plants ar e coming rapidly , and b y next y ear, industry should hav e a better sense about whether pharma plants can play a significant r ole in drug manufacturing. Transgenic plants may fall short of their potential, he said, if ther e are \u00d2unanticipated purification problems,\u00d3 if therapeutic substances made in plants ar e not as effective as those made in mammalian cells, or if cost savings do not pan out.P 081PANEL........................................................................ ........................................................................

H e thinks that, ultimately , \u00d2somewhere at this intersection of benefit-to-risk and economics...lies the contribution of transgenic plants for making human pr oducts.\u00d3 Hein, with E picyte, a company dev eloping sev eral pharmaceutical pr oducts in transgenic plants, believ es therapies r equiring lar ge quantities of human antibodies at lo w costs, such as those tar geting inflammatory diseases or intended for topical applications, \u00d2hav e the most to gain fr om plant-based pharmaceutical manufacturing.\u00d3 1 PANEL P 09Hein explor ed two issues that will be important to determining whether plants can help industry avoid a pr oduction bottleneck. O ne is whether human biological material pr oduced in transgenic plants is safe and ef fective. The other inv olves the quality of company \u00d2stewardship,\u00d3 i.e., industry \u00d5s ability to gr ow, harv est and pr ocess pharma plants in a way that addr esses public concerns about potential exposur es to humans and the envir onment. Exploring the quality of biological material deriv ed from transgenic plants, H ein noted that there is evidence that plant-pr oduced antibodies can be ef fectiv e. He cited a 1998 study published in Natur e Medicine describing a clinical trial in which a plant-deriv ed antibody was effective in pr eventing tooth decay . He also noted a 1998 study in Natur e Biotechnolo gy offering evidence fr om animal tests that a human antibody deriv ed from a transgenic plant (in this experiment, so ybeans w ere used) may pr event vaginal transmission of the herpes virus. For scientists, a key topic of discussion, accor ding to H ein, is that while transgenic plants can manufactur e antibodies that ar e nearly identical to those expr essed in human and animal cells, there is one potentially important dif ference. Although the pr otein components of the antibodies are identical, he said, plants, animals and human cells each attach a dif ferent type of carbohy drate to the antibody kno wn as a gly can. G lycans ar e of inter est to scientists, he said, because they can play a r ole in stimulating an immune r esponse. As Hein explained, in some cases they ar e important to signaling the immune system that \u00d2 there\u00d5s a bad thing o ver her e, so come o ver and let \u00d5s take car e of it.\u00d3 The issue, H ein said, is that if the gly can in the plant-pr oduced antibody looks dif ferent from what would naturally occur in a human, then \u00d2 there\u00d5s a possibility the body might recogniz e it as for eign and eliminate it fr om the system, ther eby influencing the ef ficacy of the drug.\u00d3 H ein said ther e is a lot of r esearch exploring the impact of this dif ference and, \u00d2in the end, that needs to be determined on a drug-b y-drug basis.\u00d3 While companies ar e focused on whether transgenic plants can pr oduce ef fective pharma - ceuticals, H ein noted that they ar e also awar e that they must pay close attention to \u00d2stewardship issues,\u00d3 to \u00d2 monitoring the pr oduct, pr ocess and technology so that public safety and envir onmental safety ar e protected.\u00d3 \u00d2We need to focus on the public benefit and risks so that w e clearly understand what \u00d5s at stake,\u00d3 he said.Resolving Scientific 10Nancy e director of WomenH eart: The N ational Coalition of Women with H eart D isease, said companies dev eloping pharma plant pr oducts should make patients their \u00d2 partners in this adv enture.\u00d3 She asserted that, in general, patients are \u00d2always on the side of adv ancement, on the side of scientific r esearch, on the side that sear ches for the cur e, on the side that can pr ovide us with safer , cleaner , mor e effective medicines.\u00d3 As for medicines deriv ed from transgenic plants, she expects a v ariety of r eactions fr om patients. S he believ es some will consider pharma plant pr oducts \u00d2 more natural and pur e\u00d3 because they come fr om plants. At the other extr eme, she said, ar e patients who distrust any pharmaceutical pr oducts and, ther efore, will be leery of pharma plant pr oducts. Overall, she believ es \u00d2most patients will not be concerned about the sour ce of the pr otein or the sour ce of the pharmaceutical pr oduct.\u00d3 \u00d2What w e care about is cost, safety , effectiveness, dosing and whether or not the FDA and our doctors appr ove it,\u00d3 she said. According to Lo ving, patients ar e like ev eryone else in that they \u00d2 care about the safety of food crops\u00d3 and will r ely on industry , government and the adv ocacy community to make sure pharma plants ar e produced in a way that does not endanger the food supply . She implor ed companies dev eloping pharma plants to wor k in collaboration with patients and not assume that patients ar e \u00d2too demented or too dumb to discuss or understand scientific adv ances.\u00d3 S he said patients today ar e, in general, \u00d2highly educated and w ell informed \u00d3 and \u00d2 extremely comfortable with technological inno vation.\u00d3 \u00d2I read the N ew England J ournal of M edicine, I r ead JAMA [Journal of the American M edical Association], and I ev en read the footnotes,\u00d3 she said. \u00d2I hav en\u00d5t gotten to Chemical Engineering N ews, but I\u00d5 ll get ther e and I\u00d5 ll get y our vocabulary do wn.\u00d3Cultivating the C ure: APatient P erspectiv e \u00d2What w care about is cost, safety , effectiv eness, dosing and whether or not the FDA and our doctors appr ove it.\u00d3NANCY LOVING WomenHeartIn the discussion that follo wed, B ill Freese with the envir onmental gr oup F riends of the Earth questioned whether industry \u00d5s cost assumptions for pharma plants account for expenses incurr ed in containing the cr ops (so that they do not co-mingle with food cr ops) and potential liability costs should containment fail. Hein asserted, \u00d2 The people engaged in this ar e not going to put their enterprise at risk, so they will calculate these costs on the fr ont-end.\u00d3 Melvin M athias with USDA was curious about ho w much farmland might be dev oted to growing pharmaceutical plants. H ein responded that it is dif ficult to pr oject \u00d2because w e don\u00d5t kno w how many of the drugs that hav e the potential to be pr oduced in plants actually will be.\u00d3 Hein noted that scientists trying to pr oduce antibodies in transgenic corn believ e they eventually could pr oduce 10 kilograms per acr e. McCloskey of fered that one can get a feel for the scale r equired by considering an example in which satisfying the therapeutic needs of 10,000 patients would r equire 15 kilograms of plant-pr oduced antibodies a y ear, which, under H ein\u00d5s projection, could potentially be deriv ed from an acr e and a half of corn. \u00d2You can see that if y ou were going to tr eat a million or fiv e million people or something like that, the numbers of kilograms of antibodies gr ow very gr eatly,\u00d3 McCloskey said. \u00d2B ut at the kind of estimates (H ein) just mentioned, the number of acr es consumed is r eally quite small.\u00d3 Richar d Caplan with U.S. P nterest Research Group (USP IRG) questioned whether , after the pharmaceutical pr oducts hav e been extracted, any part of the cr op would be used in human food or animal feed. H ein said his company would use the cr ops only as a \u00d2 production vehicle for drugs \u00d3 and not \u00d2in any other chain of commer ce.\u00d3 On another topic, Ann M arie Thro, who wor ks with plant br eeding and genetics at USDA, asked what might pr ompt industry to look at a wider range of transgenic cr ops for pr oducing pharmaceuticals. M ost companies ar e wor king with corn. According to Thro, ther e could be benefits fr om pursuing a mor e diverse gr oup of cr ops, such as allo wing mor e rural farm com munities to gain income via pr oduction of transgenic pharmaceutical plants.Discussing Costs, Acreage, C rop Choice, Waste and Vaccines 1 PANEL P 1 1P 12Hein noted that while it might be inter esting to consider incentiv es that would pr ompt industry to look at other cr ops, industry \u00d5s singular focus at the moment is to \u00d2 develop drugs that ar e safe and ef fective for human use.\u00d3 To accomplish this goal, H ein said industry has decided to work with cr ops \u00d2 where we hav e the most data, w e kno w the most, and we can contr ol the system the best.\u00d3 Ellen K ennedy with Calv ert Asset M anagement Company asked ho w dev eloping countries might benefit fr om pharma plants. H ein responded that, in general, one benefit might be a \u00d2broader av ailability of medicines.\u00d3 He said that when the field was in its formativ e stages, some envisioned the emer gence of pharma plants would allo w vaccine pr oduction to be mo ved into dev eloping countries, with the idea that edible cr ops engineer ed to pr oduce v accines could be gr own and consumed whereverthey w ere needed. H ein noted, ho wever, that while edible v accines might one day become a r eality, they might fall short of initial expectations. It was once thought that a v accine incorporated into an edible plant could be administer ed simply by having patients eat, say , a raw banana or potato . It now appears that in or der to make sur e the v accine is administer ed in the pr oper dose, some lev el of pr ocessing will be needed. While the v accine might still be edible and easier to distribute than conv entional vaccines because it could be packaged in small jars like bab y food, thus eliminating requirements for cold storage, H ein noted that pr oducing the v accine would still inv olve both state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities and car eful regulatory r eview, neither of which are generally av ailable in the dev eloping world. Therefore, Hein said, the benefits pharma plants may hold for dev eloping countries may be less dramatic than what was contemplated several y ears ago .\u00d2We need to focus on the public benefit and risks so that w e clearly understand what \u00d5s at stake.\u00d3MICH HEIN Epicyte Pharmaceutical, Inc. 1PANELLEAVES OF CHANGE: Potential E nvironmental I mpacts and Containment S trategies2PANEL Companies dev eloping pharma plants understand that ther e are concerns about potential risks to humans, animals and the envir onment posed b y open cultiv ation of pharmaceutical substances in transgenic cr ops, particularly when food cr ops ar e involved, said P hilip Eppard, head of r egulatory af fairs at M onsanto P rotein Technologies. He said industry r ecogniz es the need to keep pharma cr ops \u00d2contained,\u00d3 i.e., separate fr om non-pharma v arieties, at all stages of pr oduction, whether it is in the laboratory wher e seeds ar e developed, in the field as the plants matur e, or during harv esting, transport, and processing. \u00d2The key point her e is that this is a closed-loop pr oduction system, totally outside the commer cialgrain channels,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2I t\u00d5s not like I put this in my mom or dad \u00d5s grain wagon and send it down the str eet.\u00d3 He said companies dev eloping pharma plants appr oach their wor k with a mindset that \u00d2 there is a br oad dif ference betw een grain pr oduction and production.\u00d3 \u00d2The standar ds that ar e enfor ced, the standar ds we driv e towards are pharmaceutical quality standar ds,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2O ur goal is the same as any other pharmaceutical pr oduction system: to hav e a w ell-characteriz ed, stable, and safe pr oduction of medicine.\u00d3 At Monsanto, wher e transgenic corn is the primary cr op being pursued as a pharmaceutical production system, E ppard said containment begins in the laboratory wher e the plants are transformed with genetic material that allo ws them to pr oduce pharmaceutical substances. \u00d2Small numbers of people \u00d3 are involved in the wor k; their pr oducts nev er leav e company control, and ther e is no sale of the seed. Once under cultiv ation, E ppard explained, containing the pharma plants inv olves a range of practices designed mainly to r educe the risk of pollen spr eading fr om, for example, a field of pharma corn to a field of corn intended for food or feed. \u00d2The key point her e is that this is a closed-loop pr oduction system, totally outside the commer cial grain channels.\u00d3PHILIP EPPARD Monsanto Protein Technologies P 13He said M onsanto has wor ked with r egulatory of ficials to r eview data on ho w far corn pollen can trav el and r emain viable, data that is used to set minimum separation distances between fields of pharma corn and corn intended for food, feed or seed. P harma cr ops ar e also planted and harv ested at dif ferent times than food and feed cr ops, he said, so that neighboring cr ops ar e not r eceptiv e when the pharma cr ops ar e producing pollen. He further stated that M onsanto seeks to limit pollen flo w by \u00d2detasseling \u00d3 the corn, which requires removing the portion of the plant wher e most of the pollen is stor ed, and b y planting rows of non-transgenic corn next to the pharma corn to catch any pollen that might be emitted from the pharma plants. Finally, so called \u00d2 sentinel \u00d3 plots of corn ar e planted at a certain distance fr om the pharma crops and ar e routinely checked for evidence of pharma corn pollen in or der to confirm that the containment measur es ar e wor king, E ppard explained. O nce it is harv ested, Monsanto pr ocedur es call for deliv ering the pharma cr ops to pr \u00d2secured transport \u00d3 and \u00d2bonded couriers.\u00d3 \u00d2We esearch and dev elopment and ther e\u00d5s every intent at M onsanto to do this in commer cial scale as w ell,\u00d3 E ppard said.

These include concerns that such co-mingling could r esult in illness, injury , product r ecalls, lasting damage to brand names, and international mar ket disruption. Barach also noted that accidents could engender what he r eferred to as \u00d2 consumer distr ess.\u00d3 Should ther e be a mishap , he said, consumers could r eact b y avoiding certain food brands and categories and becoming distrustful of food pr ocessors. Barach stated that, in an ideal world, pharma plant pr oducers would eliminate such risks by using only non-food plants, such as tobacco and grasses. H e ackno wledged, ho wever, that food pr oducers \u00d2hav e to accept the conclusion that, at least initially ...ther e will be food plants inv olved.\u00d3 \u00d2If we do use food plants, w e would suggest...that they always be gr own in containment in isolated locations,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2 The initial constraint her e is to segr egate it fr om food cr ops.\u00d3 He stated that food pr oducers would also like to see dev elopers of pharma plants explor e an assortment of strategies to r educe the risk of co-mingling. F or example, he suggested food plants used for pharmaceutical pr oduction could be engineer ed so that the desir ed proteins ar e expr essed in the \u00d2leav es, stems or other parts \u00d3 as opposed to the \u00d2 edible part of the food plant.\u00d3 Although he ackno wledged that it has pr oven contr oversial in the other applications, B arach would like plant dev elopers to explor e using the so-called \u00d2terminator gene \u00d3 to engineer sterility into pharma plants. O ther potential measur es, he explained, could include engineering the plants with \u00d2 visual mar kers\u00d3 that distinguish them fr om cr ops intended for food, the use of \u00d2 atypical \u00d3 growing seasons, and cultiv ation in locations that ar e far r emoved from ar eas wher e food cr ops ar e grown. \u00d2All of these strategies get us to looking at sev eral degr ees of separation betw een the traditional food plant and the food plant used as drugs,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2 That\u00d5s what w e\u00d5re looking for as a food industry , mor e degr ees of separation than just containment and isolation steps.\u00d3Concer ns about Containment: AFood I ndustr y Perspectiv that the iotechnology I ndustry O rganization (BIO) has dev eloped detailed guidelines for keeping pharma plants out of the food supply . He said it was important to make sur e those guidelines ar e adher ed to not just b y the big companies, but also b y smaller operations and b y academic r esearchers and institutions experimenting with pharma plants. Barach called existing government r egulations \u00d2 adequate \u00d3 but noted that \u00d2 there\u00d5s going to be some r oom for impr ovement.\u00d3 \u00d2This r epresents something w e nev er want to see,\u00d3 B arach said, sho wing a mock-headline that r ead \u00d2M edical Carr ots Containing Vaccine F ound in B R that any industry , any gr oup that \u00d5s pursuing this to get it right the first time and to get it right ev ery time,\u00d3 he said. Barach said he does not expect food pr ocessors to ask r egulators to establish tolerance levels so that a certain amount of pharma plant pr oducts in food, should ther e be inadvertent mixing, would be consider ed safe. H e said the food industry does not envision a situation in which it would accept any amount of co-mingling betw een pharma plant products and food str ongly r ecommend and str ongly that any industry , any gr oup that \u00d5s pursuing this to get it right the first time and to get it right ev ery time.\u00d3JEFFREY BARACH National Food Processors Association P 162PANELP 172 PANELJane Rissler of the U nion of Concerned Scientists called plants engineer ed to pr oduce drugs the \u00d2 second generation \u00d3 of GM cr ops and said they hav e the potential to be both more rewarding but also mor e risky to consumers than \u00d2 first generation \u00d3 GM cr ops, such as those engineer ed with herbicide tolerance and pest r esistance. Gauging the risk associated with pharma plants, she said, ultimately will r equire data on the amount of the pr oduct that might find its way into humans, animals or the ecosystem (i.e., exposur e levels) and the safety pr ofiles of particular plant-pr oduced substances. S he illustrated this as an equation in which risk is equal to the \u00d2 potential of exposur e times the potential for harm.\u00d3 \u00d2If either one of those is z ero or near z ero, we need not worry ,\u00d3 she said. Exposur e considerations begin, she said, with who or what might inadv ertently come into contact with the pharma plant. P eople might be accidentally exposed, she said, \u00d2if the pr oduct were to get into the food supply .\u00d3 Rissler noted that domesticated or wild animals could be exposed if they end up feeding on the pharma cr op. She said soil or ganisms could absorb secr etions fr om the plant and insects could come into contact b y absorbing pollen or chewing on the leav es or stalk. Determining the significance of any exposur e, she explained, will depend on the \u00d2intended use of the \u00d3 pharma plant pr oduct. F or example, if a pharma plant w ere to pr oduce a pr otein intended as a blood-thinning agent, then one would need to kno w how it is activ ated. Safety assessments also would need to consider ho w the pr otein would af fect animals or insects. \u00d2As I\u00d5ve looked at the limited amount of information that I hav e and tried to inform it with some work on w ebsites and so on, it looks to me that it \u00d5s reasonable to conclude that some, perhaps many, pharmaceutical pr oducing food cr ops might pose risks to humans,\u00d3 she said. \u00d2I t seems like it is r easonable to conclude based on what I kno w that many pharmaceutical pr oducing cr ops may pose risks to the envir onment.\u00d3 Rissler conv eyed that it is har d for scientists to conduct independent and mor e definitiv e assessments of risks because companies consider much of the data about their plants,such as acr eage under cultiv ation and the pharmaceutical pr oduct inv olved, to be confidential business information (CBI). F urthermor e, she noted that the key agency r esponsible for monitoring field cultiv ation, USDA \u00d5s APHIS, has not conducted a formal E nvironmental Assessment or EA of a pharma plant field trial since 1998, ev en though in the last four y ears \u00d2there\u00d5s been an incr ease, w e think, in the v ariety and certainly the number of field tests.\u00d3Potential E EA which r equire agencies to solicit public comment, Rissler said that for the last four y ears scientists hav e not had \u00d2 any opportunity to find out what \u00d5s happening \u00d3 or to comment on containment standar ds. \u00d2The question for those looking fr om the outside is \u00d4 do the curr ent regulations pr otect against the human health and envir onmental risks?\u00d3 she said. \u00d2I\u00d5 m disappointed to hav e to say that they don\u00d5t. We don\u00d5t have public inv olvement, w e scientific rigor , we don\u00d5t have information.\u00d3 Rissler said industry and the go vernment should \u00d2 work together to dev elop the kind of regulatory scheme that would inspir e confidence and be pr otectiv e.\u00d3 \u00d2And w e would ur ge that ther e be a z ero tolerance in food cr ops,\u00d3 she said, \u00d2 until the government has a compr ehensiv e, transpar ent, scientifically rigor ous pr ogram in place to controlthe risks and until the public and scientific community ar e fully informed and inv olved in the r egulatory pr ocess.\u00d3 Tony Laos, pr esident of the cr op biotechnology company P rodiGene, asked Rissler what it would take to \u00d2 show that these pr oducts ar e safe.\u00d3 Rissler r esponded that ther e is a need for such things as public meetings with go vernment of ficials and independent scientists to evaluate what companies plan to do and ho w the r egulators set their standar ds for pharma plants. \u00d2Once that pr ocess is established, once w e can take a look at y our risk assessments and proposals, once w e hav e a system for assuring that ther e is pr otection, then I think y ou should hav e no pr oblem,\u00d3 Rissler said.\u00d2The question for those looking fr om the outside is \u00d4 do the curr ent regulations pr otect against the human health and envir onmental risks?

The USDA is generally the first agency pharma plant pr oducers encounter , because it must appr ove any field tests. The FDA \u00d5s main ar ea of expertise is assessing the safety and ef ficacy of ne w medicines that might emer ge from those field tests. H owever, as agency officials explained, ther e are overlapping ar eas of jurisdiction, and to addr ess these, USDA and FDA are preparing a guidance document to articulate ho w each agency will apply its authority to pharma plants. Keith Webber with FDA \u00d5s Center for B iologics E valuation and R esearch (CBER) pointed out that in dealing with pharma plants, FDA would do mor e than ev aluate the safety and ef ficacy of a plant-pr oduced drug. The FDA gets olved in the o versight of pharma plants, Webber said, when a company or inv estigator seeks its appr oval to use a pharma plant pr oduct in a human clinical trial. As part of that o versight, Webber said, FDA will assert its br oad authority to r egulate drug manufacturing facilities to set standar ds for farming operations. \u00d2We are essentially vie wing the farm as a facility ,\u00d3 Webber said. According to Webber , FDA \u00d5s authority to conduct o versight early in the drug pr oduction process is r ooted in the agency \u00d5s long-standing r egulations r equiring pharmaceutical facilities to follo w a pr oscribed set of \u00d2 good manufacturing practices \u00d3 or GMP s. For pharma plant producers, adhering to GMP regulations will r equire documentation that they hav e exercised tight contr ol over all aspects of planting, cultiv ation and harv esting. Webber said pr oducers would hav e to pr ovide evidence to FDA that they possess \u00d2 clearly written pr ocedur es for all activities \u00d3 and \u00d2 written documentation of ev erything y ou\u00d5ve and generally , that r equires two signatur es.\u00d3 They would not be allo wed to delegate the responsibility for dev eloping and follo wing such \u00d2 standar d operating pr es\u00d3 F ollowing P harma P lants fr om the F arm to the P atient P 19\u00d2It will be against the law essentially to just giv e seed to a farmer to gr ow and giv e us the bushel when y ou are done,\u00d3 he stated. One area FDA will be monitoring is the r elationship betw een seed and yield, or , as Webber explained, \u00d2ho w much y ou put in...and ho w much y ou got back.\u00d3 \u00d2This is of v alue because if ther e is a lar ge discr epancy in yield some where, that means that ther e would be a loss of seed...and companies don \u00d5t want to do that,\u00d3 he said, adding that companies will need \u00d2 written pr ocedur es in place to monitor yield.\u00d3 Such requirements for pharma plant pr oducers, Webber explained, ar e analogous to what is required of conv entional drug manufactur ers, who \u00d2hav e to keep track of ev ery vial they fill.\u00d3 GMPstandar ds also must co ver \u00d2handling of the waste str eam\u00d3 Webber said, noting that what pharma plant pr oducers do with waste material fr om their fields \u00d2 must be appr oved by the go vernment.\u00d3 As for judging the safety and ef fectiveness of the plant-made pharmaceutical, Webber noted that FDA regulatory standar ds essentially would be the same as those applied to any ne w drug. H e explained that pharma plant pr oducts, like any other drug under agency review, would require animal pr e-clinical testing and human clinical trials to answ er questions about such matters as to xicity and dose r esponse. Webber indicated that ther e would be issues specific to plant-pr oduced drugs that will be consider ed by FDA reviewers. These include concerns about whether pesticides w ere used during cultiv ation, or whether \u00d2 plant-associated the \u00d2host system.\u00d3 Webber said FDA \u00d5s regulatory activities ar e being coor dinated with USDA efforts. F or example, USDA provides FDA with \u00d2 confidential copies of all permits for plant drug biologics,\u00d3 he said, and the agencies hav e conducted joint inspections of field trials. P 203PANELP 213 PANELJim White, senior operations of ficer with B iotechnology R egulatory S ervices (formerly the Biotechnology Assessment branch) of USDA \u00d5s Animal and P lant H ealth I nspection S ervice (APHIS), noted that APHIS is giving transgenic plants that pr oduce pharmaceuticals a particularly rigorous review. For example, while APHIS has decided that many transgenic cr ops ar e safe enough to be grown free of r egulatory contr ol (these ar e kno wn as plant cultiv ation \u00d2 will always be under federal o versight.\u00d3 The goal of APHIS\u00d5s oversight, White pointed out, is to make sur e pharma plants \u00d2 are kept separate fr om any other similar plant.\u00d3 \u00d2We inspect laboratories and gr eenhouses to ensur e they ar e contained,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2 We inspect and contr ol field sites to ensur e that they ar e confined.\u00d3USDA: S ingling Pharma P lants for S pecial Scr utiny state adds conditions & concurs permit issued with conditionsstate denies permit deniedAPHIS P ermit P rocess for P P lants Permit P rocess 120 daysCHART 4 SOURCE: Adapted from a slide prepared by James White, USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).successfully unsuccessfullydeficiencies identified & applicant responds..................................................................................... .....................................................................................scientist reviewspermit completeletter, permit & proposed conditions sent to the statepermit receivedP 223PANELAccording to White, under the permitting pr ocess, any one\u00d1a company , a scientist, an academic institution\u00d1that plans to cultiv ate pharma plants must first submit a permit application, which is then r eviewed by agency scientists. O nce the agency is satisfied that the field trial meets its r egulatory standar ds, the permit is forwar ded to state of ficials, who can then add conditions or , as has happened in the past, r eject the permit. O nce cultiv ation is underway , White said, APHIS conducts inspections of all pharma plant field sites. Akey task for APHIS scientists r eviewing a permit, White said, is an assessment of what the gr ower plans to do to keep the pharma cr op from spr eading its genes, something scientists r efer to as \u00d2 gene flo w.\u00d3 In the case of corn, thus far the most widely used pharma crop, the challenge for the gr ower, he explained, is to ensur e that pollen fr om the pharma plant does not fertiliz e a sexually compatible non-pharma plant. White said agency r equirements for containing corn engineer ed to pr oduce pharmaceuticals are based on what scientists hav e learned fr om sev eral decades of studying corn \u00d5s reproductiv ebehavior . For example, he pointed out that corn generally sheds pollen for ten to fourteen days, that the pollen is viable fr om thr ee to tw enty-four hours, and that corn plants ar e generally r eceptiv e to fertilization for thr ee to fourteen days. Thus, one way to keep pharma corn fr om spr eading its drug-pr oducing genes to non-pharma corn is to schedule planting so that pollen pr oduction occurs befor e or after other corn plants would be r eceptiv e to fertilization. White said APHIS also has consider ed research indicating that gene flo w betw een corn crops is r educed b y 99.5 per cent when they ar e a quarter of a mile apart. Armed with information about when pollen is shed and ho w far it trav els, APHIS has come up with containment standar ds that pr escribe when pharma corn can be planted and ho w far it must be fr om other corn plants. White said ther e could be no corn of any type within a half-mile of the pharma plants and no corn intended for seed pr oduction within a mile. In addition, the pharma corn must be planted at least tw enty-one days befor e or after any corn that is betw een half a mile and a mile away .P 233 PANELSites are at least 1 mile away from corn seed production No other corn plants are grown within a radius of 0.5 miles of the transgenic test plants at any time during the field test Transgenic corn must be planted no less than 21 days before, or 21 days after, the planting dates of any other corn that is growing within a zoneextending from 0.5 to 1.0 mile of the transgenic test plantsFederal Confinement S tandar ds for P harma Cor n Open pollination confinement measur es for 2002 G rowing S eason ..................................................................................... .....................................................................................CHART 5 SOURCE: Adapted from a slide prepared by James White, USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).

Overall, r egardless of the safety pr ofile associated with a particular pharma plant pr oduct, White declar ed, \u00d2APHIS is committed to doing what is humanly possible to keep these products out of the food supply and to do the best job possible of ensuring the safe field testing of these pr oducts.\u00d3 \u00d2APHIS is committed to doing what is humanly possible to keep these pr oducts out of the food supply and to do the best job possible of ensuring the safe field testing of these pr oducts.\u00d3JIM WHITE USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)P 253 PANELBradley S hurdut, who leads go vernment and r egulatory af fairs for biotechnology for D ow Agrosciences, said companies pr oducing pharma plants understand that \u00d2 without pr oper control\u00d3 they will be unable to pr otect, nurtur e and r ealize the ex citing benefits of this extremely v aluable opportunity . An important aspect of managing the pr ocess, he said, is a strong regulatory pr esence from regulatory agencies such as USDA and FDA bolster ed by a deep corporate commitment to ste wardship . \u00d2We need r egulations tough and w e need them transpar ent,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2 We hav e and continue to wor k with go vernment to mo ve this thing forwar d quickly and in a way that is compr ehensiv e, so w e are willing to raise the bar .\u00d3 Shurdut agr ees that r egulations should focus on av oiding unintended pollen flo w \u00d2off the site,\u00d3 as well as the inadv ertent commingling of biopharma grain. This do vetails, he said, with industry \u00d5sinterest in maintaining the purity of the pr oduct b y keeping non-pharma pollen and seed away from the pharma cr ops, wher e its pr esence could compr omise the integrity of the highly r egulated finished pharmaceutical pr oduct. \u00d2We need to pr otect these cr ops fr om pollen flo wing either into or out of the biopharma sites,\u00d3 he said. Shurdut said industry members agr ee on the principle that for the time being pharma plants should be dev eloped in r egions outside of commodity pr oduction ar eas. To stress that \u00d4biopharming \u00d5is a highly r egulated, specializ ed business opportunity for companies, he argued that it is important to dispel notions that pharma cr ops ar e a \u00d2value-added \u00d3 opportunity for a significant number of farmers.

Shurdut noted that pharma plants ar e expensiv e products and it is in a company \u00d5s self- interest to maintain complete contr ol of all aspects of the pr ocess. This is imperativ e to delivering a cost-ef fectiv e, quality pr oduct while minimizing potential losses attributed to lost pr oduct, liability claims, damage to corporate \u00d2 good will,\u00d3 and costs associated with go vernment enfor cement actions. Overall, S hurdut believ es industry would benefit fr om adopting \u00d2 product ste wardship\u00d3 practices that compliment federal standar ds. For example, he described ho w Dow\u00d5s curr ent business plan calls for the conduct of experimental wor k in the S outhw est\u00d1a high-yield area that is far fr om corn pr oduction ar eas.P 273 PANELGreg Jaffe, a lawy er with the Center for Science in the P ublic I nterest, said that despite assurances fr om both go vernment and industry , protecting humans and the envir onment from risks posed b y pharma plant pr oducts r equires an \u00d2 overhaul \u00d3 of the existing regulatory structur e. Akey flaw in the curr ent regulatory practices, J affe indicated, is that the go vernment almost nev er requires a formal E nvironmental Assessment (EA) befor e a pharma plant is approved for open-air cultiv ation. H e pointed out that when they ar e required, the assessments are \u00d2not adequate \u00d3 because they \u00d2 don\u00d5t deal with all of the envir onmental risks,\u00d3 a criticism, he noted, that originally came fr om a N ational R esearch Council (NR C) report on transgenic plants and envir onmental safety . White, with APHIS, r esponded that while his agency considers envir onmental issues for every permit inv olving pharma plants, ther e is a r eason it rar ely conducts a formal EA. As White explained, while in general many federal agency decisions must be supported b y an EA, USDA has carv ed out an ex emption for agency actions inv olving field trials that would include pr ocedur es for containing the cr op. Furthermor e, APHIS r equires containment measur es for all pharma plant field tests. In addition to his criticism of the envir onmental r eviews, Jaffe contended that, ocess \u00d2lacks both transpar ency and participation.\u00d3 example, affe argued that when APHIS dev eloped containment standar ds for pharma crops, it allo wed industry , but not the general public, to participate. \u00d2We weren\u00d5t given an opportunity to comment on those befor e they w ere put out and my understanding is that industry and other people w ere given an opportunity to comment,\u00d3 he said. J affe claimed that in the original draft of the containment standar ds, pharma corn was to be kept fiv e miles fr om seed corn but in the final draft it ended up being one mile.Potential G aps in the Ov ersight SchemeP 283PANEL\u00d2I\u00d5m not sur e why that was changed, I\u00d5 m not sur e what the scientific implications w ere behind that, but that lack of transpar ency, that lack of public participation in those kinds of decision- making things giv es me cause to be concerned about this pr ocess,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2Even if, in the end, w e hav e a good permit and so forth, it doesn \u00d5t lend itself to having a lot of confidence in the pr ocess and a sense that ev erybody \u00d5s views are being consider ed.\u00d3 He said public participation also is limited b y the fact that much of the data contained in an APHIS permit is labeled confidential and hence unav ailable for outside r eview. He noted that authors of the NR C report had dif ficulty assessing the risks posed b y pharma plants because much of the information submitted to APHIS was labeled confidential. Andrew Baum, head of S emBiosSys Genetics, said he understands the need for transpar ency but wonder ed ho w that can be r econciled with \u00d2 the legitimate need to keep our pr ograms confidential.\u00d3 J affe responded b y arguing that if companies faced mor e stringent r equirements for justifying why certain information must be kept confidential, mor e data would end up in the public domain while legitimate trade secr ets still would be pr otected. H e also suggested that companies consider pr ocedur es that might allo w individuals outside the pr ocess to view certain information on permits with the stipulation that it be kept confidential. Rissler , with the U nion of Concerned Scientists, told B aum that companies \u00d2hav e to think about ho w to gain the public \u00d5s confidence and not lose (their) commer cial adv antage.\u00d3 S he said ther e would be gr eater public acceptance of pharma plants if \u00d2 we had some independent scientists under go vernment of fices looking at some of these containment measur es.\u00d3 \u00d2I would like to, as the EP A(Environmental P rotection Agency) has done on many occasions (involving transgenic cr ops), bring together a scientific advisory panel of outside scientists to look at things like y our containment strategy ,\u00d3 she said. \u00d2 That would impr ove confidence and that would be an important thing to do .\u00d3 As it no w stands, accor ding to Rissler , when it comes to assessing pharma plant safety , \u00d2we don \u00d5t kno w what being e don \u00d5t kno w wher e it\u00d5s being done, w e don \u00d5t kno w how much of it is being done.\u00d3A LOOK AT FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS AND THE ROLES OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS IN FILLING THEM4PANEL Mary Clutter , assistant dir ector of the N ational Science F oundation, sought to place the development of pharma plants into a br oader context b y discussing the challenges to what she referred to as \u00d221st century biology .\u00d3 Among those, she said, ar e dealing with the public \u00d5s understanding of science in general, and genetic engineering in particular , as well as the lack of funding for basic r esearch on plant biology .

We\u00d5re not going to solv e any of these major challenges without an ef fective partnership .\u00d3MARY CLUTTER National Science FoundationNorman E llstrand, an expert in plant population genetics at the U niversity of California, Riverside, noted that basic r esearch in plant biology is critical to understanding ho w plants ex change genetic material. B etter insights into gene flo w betw een plants, E llstrand said, will lead to gr eater confidence in measur es designed to pr event pharma plants fr om spreading their no vel traits to food and feed cr ops and to wild plants. Ellstrand discussed sev eral ways agricultural cr ops can mo ve bey ond their intended ar eas of cultiv ation and br eed with other cr ops or wild plants. S eed dispersal is one av enue of \u00d2escape,\u00d3 E llstrand said, while some plants, such as strawberries, ar e capable of br eeding when fragments of the plant disperse. B ut he said pollen is the \u00d2 most ef fective mechanism \u00d3 used b y plants to ex change genetic material. In agricultur e settings, E llstrand said, drifting pollen r outinely pr oduces hybrids betw een dif ferent varieties of the same cr op and betw een cr ops and wild r elatives that exist nearb y. Regardless of ho w it occurs, E llstrand said ther e is evidence that most cr ops\u00d1and it makes no difference whether they ar e transgenic or conv entional\u00d1\u00d2 spontaneously mate with other v arieties of the same species (cr op-to-cr op gene flo w) and mate with wild r elatives (crop-to-wild gene flo w) some where in the world.\u00d3 F or example, in the U.S. ther e is evidence of crop-to-cr op gene flo w from farm to farm betw een cr ops of corn and betw een cr ops of canola. Although corn has no wild r elatives in the U.S., E llstrand noted that it does hav e wild r elatives in M exico. Overall, the ef fect of gene flo w, whether cr op-to-wild, or cr op-to-cr op, depends on the particular genetic traits that might be passed along, E llstrand said. F or example, he noted that in E urope, pr oduction of domesticated sugar beet suf fered when they spontaneously bred with wild sugar beets because the union pr oduced hybrids that w ere unsuitable for harvest. In northeastern California, E llstrand said, spontaneous br eeding betw een \u00d2 range grass and ry e led to the ev olution of a ne w weed which caused farmers to abandon wheat and ry e production.\u00d3 According to E llstrand, safety concerns about pharma cr ops ar e largely focused on the possibility that a plant engineer ed to pr oduce drugs might spontaneously br eed with a food or feed cr op of the same species and pass along its drug making traits in the pr ocess. But ther e also ar e concerns, he said, that a pharma plant might spontaneously br eed with a wild r elativ e and posit into the br oader ecosystem a wild, hybrid plant capable of producing pharmaceutical compounds. P 314 PANELPlant P romiscuity and I ts Implications for ContainmentP 324PANELEllstrand said in assessing risks posed b y various pharma cr ops, the \u00d2 worst possible plant with r egards to confining its genes \u00d3 would be one that: >>routinely br eeds with r elated cr op varieties; >>produces lar ge amounts of pollen and seed (and the seeds ar e particularly small); >>serves as an important food and feed cr op; >>spontaneously mates with wild r elatives and >>is widely planted thr oughout the world \u00d2That would be the kind of species w e would r eally want to av oid (for pharma cr ops),\u00d3 he said. \u00d2 That species is maiz e (corn), unfortunately , and ther e are others as w ell. Canola would be v ery dif ficult (to contain). S o if these ar e going to be planted, w e hav e to go to very gr eat lengths to av oid...contamination pr oblems.\u00d3 Ellstrand said the desir e to keep pharma cr ops fr om ex ercising their natural ability to breed, either with other cr ops or with wild r elatives, points to a need for mor e research on the ef fectiveness of \u00d2 traditional confinement methods,\u00d3 such as those r ecently instituted by USDA for pharma cr ops, and on other techniques as w ell. For example, E llstrand pointed to evidence that planting cr ops w ell befor e or after cultiv ation has begun for r elated cr ops, so called \u00d2 temporal isolation,\u00d3 is \u00d2 a much mor e effective method \u00d3 of deterring gene flo w than ar e buffer zones or \u00d2 spatial isolation.\u00d3 Ellstrand cautioned, ho wever, \u00d2Research on temporal isolation has been v ery limited.\u00d3 Ellstrand ar gued that other methods of confinement, such as engineering plants with sterility , also should be studied. \u00d2I think that genetic solutions for containment ar e ones that should be pursued with regards to futur e research,\u00d3 he said. Whatev er method is consider ed, Ellstrand noted that it must be tested in dif ferent envir on- mental conditions and with dif ferent plant v arieties in or der to measur its ef fectiveness. Shantu S hantharam of a company that pr oduces both conv entional and biotech crops, said that after 15 y ears of field testing and sev eral y ears of commer cialization he is \u00d2not awar e of any terrible consequences that people hav e faced \u00d3 due to gene escape fr om transgenic cr ops. Ellstrand commented that the only \u00d2 downside \u00d3 he has seen so far fr om gene flo w involving transgenic plants has been the spontaneous emer gence of canola that possess thr ee different traits for herbicide r esistance. While not \u00d2 an incr edible har dship,\u00d3 he said, the ne w hybrid does make it mor e difficult for farmers to contr ol volunteer canola. Ellstrand said that his r esearch into conv entional cr ops has sho wn that while pr oblems related to gene flo w are rare, when they do occur \u00d2 they can be doozies.\u00d3 H e expects the situation with transgenic cr ops to be no dif ferent. While pr oblems r elated to gene flo w may be few, he said, when they occur they could be significant, such as cr eating a super w eed or, in the case of pharma cr ops, adulterating food and feed with drugs. P 334 PANEL \u00d2I think that genetic solutions for containment ar e ones that should be pursued with r egards to futur e research.\u00d3NORMAN ELLSTRAND University of California, RiversideP 344PANELIowa State\u00d5s Walter F ehr, a food cr op scientist who also focuses on public education and bioethics, discussed ho w the intr oduction of transgenic cr ops in the mid-1990s has impacted the farm belt. M ost notably , he said, cr op segr egation, of little concern less than ten y ears ago, is no w a major issue\u00d1and one that will intensify with the arriv al of pharma cr ops. Fehr explained that in the days befor e GM cr ops, while or ganic pr oducers generally wanted to keep their harv ested commodities separate fr om those who used certain pesticides, there was little concern about co-mingling of seeds or pollen. Then came transgenic cr op varieties, such as corn that pr oduces the pesticide kno wn as Bt and so ybean engineer ed to be r esistant to the R oundup herbicide. This pr esented ne w challenges for farmers whose customers did not want transgenics in their pr oducts, F ehr said, since pollen flo w or the inadvertent mixing of seeds fr om GM v arieties could lead to lost business. The desir e for cr op segr egation became ev en mor e complex, F ehr observ ed, when S tarlink, transgenic corn appr oved for animal but not human use, arriv ed on the scene and ended up co-mingling with cr ops intended for human food. As a r esult, F ehr said, all farmers growing food for human consumption, whether they w ere using transgenic or conv entional varieties, wanted their cr ops segr egated fr om Starlink. Now pharma cr ops ar e entering the pictur e, he said, pr esenting another cr op variety that will need to be isolated fr om other v arieties. Pharma cr ops ar e an especially pr ovocativ e topic in I owa, Fehr noted. H e described ho w local papers hav e featur ed news about a ne w transgenic corn v ariety that contains an antibody to the herpes virus, and ho w such stories hav e provoked str ong, often negativ e reactions. Fehr said some farmers worry that if this pharma corn is accidentally co-mingled with food and feed v arieties, it could af fect the safety and mar ketability of their state \u00d5s main commodity cr op. Understanding What P harma M eans for the F arm BeltP 354 PANELMitch H ein, with E picyte, questioned whether ther e is a factual basis for such fears or whether people simply hav e an \u00d2 emotional \u00d3 response when they hear the wor ds \u00d2antibody \u00d3 and \u00d2herpes.\u00d3 For example, H ein wonder ed why someone would be mor e concerned about corn with a transgene that codes for an antibody as opposed to corn with a transgene that codes for a pesticide, since antibodies ar e naturally pr esent in a range of food pr oducts. Kathryn S tein of M acrogenics added, \u00d2 Anybody who has ev er had a cold sor e has antibodies to a herpes virus.\u00d3 Fehr said he used the example of herpes antibodies in corn pr ecisely because it elicits an emotional r esponse. H e said he was not suggesting that herpes antibodies ar e unsafe, but that he was trying to help companies and r egulators understand the \u00d2 dilemma this cr eates\u00d3 in terms of convincing the public that pharma plants will not pose a thr eat. \u00d2The point I am making is that this is going to be a v ery emotional issue for the public,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2I t is so dif ferent than what w e hav e ever done befor e with r espect to something in the food supply .... As long as y ou\u00d5re awar e of ho w tough it \u00d5s going to be to educate the public, then I\u00d5 m happy .\u00d3 Fehr said companies should think about impr oving public confidence in pharma plants by having safety assessments conducted b y independent parties, such as public research institutions. \u00d2If I can say to an audience \u00d4 this is safe based on a federal r egulatory agency \u00d5s review, it was studied b y Pennsylv ania S tate U niversity, the U niversity of I llinois, the U niversity of Maryland, all of which found this to be safe,\u00d5 that\u00d5s going to make a significant dif ference,\u00d3 he said. H owever, if safety assurances r est solely on industry-supplied data, then the public would be mor e skeptical.\u00d2The point I am making is that this is going to be a v ery emotional issue for the public. I t is so dif ferent than what w e hav e ever done before with r espect to something in the food supply .\u00d3WALTER FEHR Iowa State UniversityFormer FDA Commissioner Jane Henney said transgenic plants offer the potential to produce medicines that are safer, cheaper and more easily distributed than what iscurrently available. She said, however, questions still remain about the effectiveness of plant-derived drugs and consumers will need assurances that government oversightof this new technology is \u00d2working in their best interest.\u00d3 Henney described the \u00d2fundamental reasons\u00d3 companies are investigating whether pharma plants can produce biological material for new drug therapies. These includethe fact that, unlike existing systems, which produce the material in mammaliancells, plants don\u00d5t carry the risk of passing on infectious diseases. She also noted thattransgenic plants have the potential to lower production costs, savings that could bepassed along to the patient. They also offer the ability to scale-up manufacturing muchfaster than one could do with mammalian cells. In addition, Henney asserted that plant-produced vaccines could facilitate distribution of preventive therapies by eliminating the need for injections. Henney, however, also stated that there are still \u00d2many issues\u00d3 that must still be addressed. On the scientific front, Henney pointed out that there are questions abouthow effective plant-derived products will be at eliciting an immune response andwhether certain plant-made substances will be as stable as those produced in mammaliansystems. As the field moves forward, she said, there is a need to instill public confidencethat pharma plants and their products are safe, something she believes can be abettedby a willingness to engage in a frank, open dialogue. \u00d2Scientists and the public need to find and foster open discussion of even the most controversial topics,\u00d3 she said. \u00d2Never assume that science is too sophisticated for thecitizenry to understand.\u00d3 Henney noted that, \u00d2we often range from faith to fear as we approach anything new in our experience and certainly as we think about technologies.\u00d3 But she said that \u00d2weshould not let our faith be that of being blind faith nor our fears be irrational. Weshould approach our discussion and our openness with facts that could support either.\u00d3 Henney encouraged all sides to look for common ground, with the search for \u00d2better ways to deliver safe products for patients\u00d3 as a goal \u00d2we might all share.\u00d3 She alsoadvised regulators to maintain public trust by demonstrating that their decisions aredetermined by science, not politics. \u00d2The public clearly wants assurances, whether it\u00d5s bioengineered food or bioengineered therapeutics from plants, that government bodies and regulatory decision making isworking in their best interests and that the decisions made are informed, objective andevidence-based as well as being open to change when further evidence demands,\u00d3 she said. \u00d2Scientists and the public need to find and foster open discussion of even the most contr oversial topics.
