For too long, those who suspect they might suffer from sleep apnea have had to deal with a frustrating experience involving multiple specialist referrals, long wait times, several co-pays, and exhausting overnight diagnostic tests. Suppose you are found to suffer from sleep apnea after months of appointments; a therapy device is dropped at your door with minimal support and coaching. Not exactly a recipe for success. BetterNight allows you to schedule a telemedicine consult with a doctor. After speaking with the doctor, if recommended, BetterNight will ship a Home Sleep Testing device to wear for one night in the comfort of your home. A board-certified physician will review the data and make a recommendation on therapy. BetterNight will deliver the therapy device to your home, and our Sleep Specialists and Respiratory Therapists will support and coach you through the entire process.
