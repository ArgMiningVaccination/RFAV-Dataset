Anyone thought about this? What are good and bad about having a degree in naturopathic medicine (ND)? I wouldn't discount this practice. I know of a Chiropractor who is a Naturopath also and have seen him do some amazing things. He practices body energetics. He charges cash only and does very well. Does he also have a chiropractor license? I guess I'm curious what the earning potential is for NDs. What is average? Do NPs recommend vaccines? Because if they do I could never recommend one. Well. I'm glad (kinda) that they are able to exploit our rigorous vaccination programs so their offspring don't have to suffer horrible death and illness due to their parents ignorance What I do find mildly entertaining is that 5 years ago I would've found myself making the same comments from others I've read here. Mocking what we don't understand or don't accept on the internet has become an American pastime. You really do think you have it figured out at 30. Certainly there are charlatans out there. You have to search long and hard to find the great practitioners as in any profession. When you do find them you have to seriously rethink what you've come to know. We have been herded into Western medicine like cattle. Many of these techniques have been used in Eastern medicine for centuries. The NP/chiropractor I know did not have his children or his grandchildren vaccinated for anything. His children are in their 20's now. They are not maimed or sickly and have never been. They walk among us with full confidence that their immune systems are strong. I know it's a small sample size. It's just one example of what I've seen him do. He has combined multiple disciplines into one. He's a very unique practitioner. You don't run into people with this knowledge often. I know it's a small sample size. It's just one example of what I've seen him do. Your tag says you are a pharmacist, so I will assume you have taken a statistics course. In fact, your mention of sample size would support that. Assuming you understood what you were taught, why would you then think this constitutes any sort of evidence? It would be the equivalent of me claiming cigarette smoking prevents cancer because my grandfather has smoked for sixty years and is still alive and cancer free. There is a big leap from agreeing that many natural products work or have medicinal benefit, to believing in mysticism such as energy meridians/healing crystals, or ideas with no scientific merit such as homeopathy. As a learned individual who has been educated in the sciences, you should have the tools at your disposal to make these judgments. This is not mysticism. I haven't mentioned healing crystals. Despite the flu vaccine having weak efficacy studies and not being more effective than placebo you still recommend everyone over the age of 6 should receive it. This is something you do not understand. You have been trained in Western medicine and you and your patients go where your insurance company tells you to go. I don't think you need me to tell you that they do not always place your health as their #1 priority. They do all they can to discredit other health practices. There are certainly charlatans in every profession. You really have to search to find the great ones. This is not mysticism. I haven't mentioned healing crystals.

This is extremely dangerous to your patients as a health professional. I want you to take 20 minutes and read the CDC website about influenza. I want you then to debate me on two topics. First there is no established VE for the flu vaccine. Second the mortality of influenza + pneumonia remains unchanged (8.8-9.1% in 99-00 vs 5.5-9.9% in 12-13) despite a higher vaccination rate due to vaccinations being available at pharmacies. It is your job as a healthcare professional to present the patient with the facts and let them make the decision whether or not a treatment is necessary. If you want to be an ND you might as well become a reiki master and sell crystals It's all that positive energy, right? Hilarious. But hey, if it works for you, the only side effect I'd expect is a lighter wallet.Hey have you ever received reiki from a reiki master? Ever practiced it? Hard to tell by your comment but it's highly effective and interesting. Why judge? Do NPs recommend vaccines? Because if they do I could never recommend one. Biggest downside? Being a quack. ...Perhaps one of the best perspectives on the whole vaccination paradigm is provided by Dr. Harold Buttram, M.D., FAACP: \"As one of today's senior citizens who grew up in a Midwestern state in the 1930s, and as a doctor who has treated many children, I may have a special vantage point of time and experience in regard to the changes that have taken place in the health of America's children since the relatively innocent times of the 1930s. At summer camps in the New Mexico Mountains that I was fortunate to attend, no boy had allergies, none was on medication, and no boy was ever sick with the common ailments of today. It was much the same in schools. I don't recall ever seeing a child with easily recognized behaviors now described as hyperactivity (ADHD) or autism. Today in stark contrast, approximately one-third of our youngsters are afflicted with the 4-A Disorders (Autism, ADHD, Asthma, and Allergies), as described and documented by Dr. Kenneth Bock. School budgets are being strained to the breaking points in providing special education classes for autistic and learning disabled children. Allergy problems are proliferating, as indicated by long lines of children at school nursing stations for their noontime medications. Could today's infant and childhood vaccine programs, with their steadily increasing numbers of vaccines, be a contributory cause of this ominous health trend? As reflected in the U.S. Congressional Hearings (1999 to December 2004) on issues of vaccine safety, in which major deficiencies in vaccine safety testing were disclosed, it is a real possibility that vaccines may be one of the major, if not the major cause of this trend.\" Herd immunity is a myth. Do a little research. There have been plenty of outbreaks in heavily vaccinated populations in the last 10 years. If vaccines really worked then the 95% wouldn't have to worry about the 5% who aren't vaccinated. I'm surprised this guy hasn't been ripped apart by SDN yet You'd probably be better off talking to people who don't have a medical education. he has been - he spreads horrible myths and does a diservice to all of us \"professionals\"I'm surprised this guy hasn't been ripped apart by SDN yet You'd probably be better off talking to people who don't have a medical education. typical SDC fun - come on - you know every thread devolves into 1 of 4 topics:What the hell kind of stupidity is going on in this thread?

It was much the same in schools. I don't recall ever seeing a child with easily recognized behaviors now described as hyperactivity (ADHD) or autism. Um, that was probably because of the much higher infant and child death rate. Many children with allergies died, or were so chronically ill, they weren't attending a summer camp. The fact that children with chronic ailments are alive & functioning is 2015 is a testament to modern medicine. I don't believe \"everything\" I hear from science, and I'm not gung-ho on the flu shot (because it does have a low effective rate), but the idea that vaccines are not effective is contradicted by all of history. People routinely died of all kinds of communicable diseases that are not prevented by vaccines. And yes, they died of these diseases even when they had good hygiene. Seriously, do you know how many American's died or were left chronically disabled by polio in the 1950's, before the polio vaccine was introduced? Do you really think 1950's Americans were living in dirt and grime, since I know anti-vaccer's like to claim that cleanliness will prevent communicable diseases? (hint, public plumbing WAS available for most people in the 1950's, and even in the few rural areas that didn't have it, people did have outhouses and knew to wash their hands-they certainly weren't throwing their excrement in their drinking water.) Our drinking water and sewage systems were not very well separated here in the 1950's as one would like to think. There were signs along the Hudson River in the 1950's saying \"Do not swim. Polio may be present\". Also the dangers of the polio vaccine are well documented. Even Jonas Salk testified in 1977 that the majority of the Polio cases in the US since 1961 were caused by the vaccine. In present day India there have been incidence of mass paralysis after vaccinations for polio. Also how come despite massive vaccination efforts in India and Africa over the last 50 years does Polio still exist. It's because their raw sewage is mixed with their drinking water. If you examine charts of the incidence of polio you can see that it was in decline before the vaccine was produced. What the hell kind of stupidity is going on in this thread?
