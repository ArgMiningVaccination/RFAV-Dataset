It posed serious challenges for Public Health System. India's efforts tomanage the pandemic can be best described as apeople-centric, whole of Government, whole of societyapproach built on past experiences of managing publichealth emergencies as well as contemporary scientificknowledge. India's approach has been directed atcontaining the spread of infection, while strengtheningrequisite core capacities to minimize the health and non-health impact of the pandemic especially on the mostvulnerable sections of society. India's leadershipundertook many proactive and decisive steps very earlyin response to the pandemic, some of the keyinterventions included actions at points of entry,nationwide lockdown, focus on test, track, isolate&treat etc. These interventions not only slowed downthe spread of COVID-19 in the country but also gaveenough time for the country to build public healthcapacities to effectively manage the pandemic. The Govt. of India took proactive and pre-emptive steps to respond to the pandemic and initiated thepreparedness of the health system to address all aspectsof COVID-19 management. Govt. of India followed'Test, Track and Treat' strategy diligently and continued the emphasis on preventive measures tocontain the spread of the virus which includes wearingmasks, hand wash/use of sanitizer, adequate physicaldistancing, prompt testing on observing symptoms andprompt isolation on testing positive. With consistentcollaborative efforts between Centre & States/UTs,country has managed to maintain lowest positivity andmortality rates coupled with one of the highest recoveryrate, globally.On 16th January 2021, India launched the NationalCOVID Vaccination Programme that commencedwith vaccination to all Health Care Workers. Thevaccination programme is being guided by immaculateplanning based on a regular review of scientific andglobal best practices. Since the start of the COVIDVaccination drive, it has focused on decisions guidedby science. Prioritizing our health workers, frontlineworkers and other vulnerable population in a phasedmanner has been an excellent way to scale up thevaccination program. Now, all adults are eligible forCOVID vaccination. Vaccination of children of 15years to 18 years started on 3 rd January, 2022. Under the programme, all citizens irrespective of theirincome status are entitled to free vaccination. Whilethose who have the ability to pay are encouraged touse private hospital's vaccination centres. Threevaccines are being used in COVID vaccination drive,these include two made in only inprivate hospitals). A unique digital platform- Co-WIN 2.0 for COVID 19 vaccination, helps programme managers inregistration and tracking of COVID-19 vaccinationbeneficiaries along with real time information on theavailable stocks of vaccine, their storage temperature,actual vaccination process, generation of digitalcertificates etc. This also serves as a platform forregistration and scheduling appointment for vaccinationfor the eligible beneficiaries. It is available in 12 regionallanguages and has requisite interfaces for differentlyabled persons. Up to 4 beneficiaries can be registeredANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 12on Co-WIN using a single mobile number to facilitate registration of persons without access to mobile phones.A total of 9 photo identity cards can be used forregistration of beneficiaries with a provision of specialsessions for persons without identity card. For the easeof beneficiaries, Near to Home Vaccination Sessionsare available for senior citizens and persons withdisability, \"Onsite registrations\" [also known as walkin registration] and vaccinations, registration withdisability certificate for Person with disabilities andAssisted registration through Common Service Centers(CSCs) and 1075 helpline Number services have beenmade available.

Out of the total eligible adult population, over92% citizens had received 1st doseof COVID vaccine while over 70% eligible citizenshad received both doses of the vaccine, at present. To sustain this momentum, \"HarGharDastak\" Campaign was initiated on 3rd November which aimsto ensure 100% coverage of eligible beneficiaries with1st dose of the COVID vaccine and vaccination ofdue beneficiaries with 2nd dose of the COVIDvaccines. Under the campaign, the healthcare workersreach out, counsel, and vaccinate all missed-out anddropped-out eligible beneficiaries.

On similar lines, theGovernment now proposes to bring reforms in thesector of Nursing Education by replacing the existingIndian Nursing Council through a new regulatory body,called the National Nursing and MidwiferyCommission. The paradigm shift that is envisagedthrough replacement of the Indian Nursing CouncilANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 13 (INC) with the National Nursing and Midwifery Commission is to have a transparent, professional andaccountable 'selected' Regulator rather than an'elected' Regulator, thereby bringing in accountability,transparency, professional integrity and excellence intothe profession.

The NHSRC functionsunder the guidance of a Governing Board headed bythe Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare,Government of India and an Executive Committeeheaded by the Additional Secretary & MissionDirector, National Health Mission (NHM), Ministryof Health & Family Welfare. The Regional ResourceCentre, North-East (RRC-NE), a Branch of theNHSRC, serves as the technical support organizationfor the States in the North East. 18) 15 th FC Recommendations on Health Grants through Local Governments a) The 15th Finance Commission (FC-XV), constituted by the President on November 2017 was, inter-alia, mandated to recommend measuresneeded to augment the Consolidated Funds ofthe States, for the period spanning FY 2020-25.The FC-XV had submitted two reports, one forthe year 2020-21 and the Final Report for theperiod 2021-22 to 2025-26. The Commissionhas recommended that health spending by Statesshould be increased to more than 8 per cent oftheir budget by 2022. The Commission has alsorecommended that Primary healthcareexpenditure should be two-thirds of the total healthexpenditure by 2022 and that Centrally SponsoredSchemes (CSS) in health should be flexible enoughto allow States to adapt and innovate, with thefocus shifting from inputs to outcomesb) The commission recommended grants for the health sector as follows: (i) grants aggregating toRs.70,051Crores through local governments and(ii) sectoral grants aggregating to Rs. 31,755Crores to States. The XV-FC had alsorecommended State-specific grants for healthamounting to Rs. 4,800 Crore. The total grants-in-aid support to the health sector over the awardperiod works out to be Rs.1,06,606 Crore. c) The Union Government on 30-01-2021 vide Explanatory Memorandum as to the Action Takenon the Recommendations made by the FifteenthFinance Commission in its Final Report for the years2021-22 to 2025-26 inter-alia accepted therecommendations of the FC-XV only in respectof the Local Bodies. On the recommendations forthe sectoral grants of various ministries including ofHealth Ministry, the Union Government hadclarified that due consideration to sectors identifiedby the Commission will be given while formulatingand implementing existing and new CentrallySponsored and Central Sector Schemes d) Accordingly,the accepted recommendation of FC- XV through Health Grants through LocalGovernments (grants of Rs 70,051 Crore for theperiod to 2021 - 22 to 2025-2026) to strengthenthe health care system at the primary health carelevel are provided for the following: urban healthand wellness centres (HWCs), building-lesssubcentres, PHCs, CHCs, block level public healthunits, support for diagnostic infrastructure for theprimary healthcare activities and conversion of ruralsub centres and PHCs to HWCs Components of FC-XV Recommendations,involving Local Bodies: As per FC-XV Recommendations, Rs. 43,928 crores has been allocated for healthcare facilitiesin rural areas to be coordinated by Rural LocalBodies (RLBs). Four key components approved under the grants involving RLB's are:ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 44a) Support for diagnostic infrastructure to the primary healthcare facilities : The FC-XV provides support for diagnostic infrastructure in Sub Health Centres (SCHs) and Primary HealthCentres (PHCs) under the vision of comprehensive primary healthcare. Diagnostic services are critical for the delivery of healthservices, and these grants are intended to fully equip the primary health care facilities so that they can provide some necessary diagnostic services b) Block Level Public Health Units : Block public health units (BPHU) would integrate the functionsof service delivery, public health action,strengthened laboratory services for disease surveillance, diagnosis and public health and serve as the hub for health-related reporting. TheBPHUs will also improve decentralised planning and the preparation of block plans that feed into district plans. In addition, they will improveaccountability for health outcomes. Given that the block health facility is co-terminus with the Block Panchayat /Panchayat Samiti/Taluka Panchayat,this has the potential to facilitate convergence with the panchayati raj institutions and the child development project officer of the IntegratedChild Development Scheme (ICDS)programme.The FC-XV proposes to providesupport to BPHUs in all the 28 States c) Building-less Sub centres, PHCs, CHCs : An assessment of infrastructure gaps in rural PHCs/Sub centres based on Rural Health Statistics showsthat number PHCs and S HCs do not have the necessary infrastructure to meet the targets of the National Health Policy, 2017. The Commissionproposes to provide support for necessary infrastructure for Sub Health Centre - HWCs and Primary Health Centre - HWCs in rural areas inclose collaboration with rural local bodies d) Conversion of Rural PHCs and Sub Centres into Health and Wellness Centres: TheUnion Government has envisaged the creation of1,50,000 HWCs by transforming existing SHCs and PHCs as the basic pillar of Ayushman Bharat to deliver comprehensive primary health care. Itis proposed to provide support for necessary infrastructure for the conversion of rural PHCs and SHCs into HWCs so that they are equippedand staffed by an appropriately trained primary health care team, comprising of multi-purpose workers (male and female) and ASHAs and ledby a mid-level health provider. PHCs linked to a cluster of HWCs would serve as the first point of referral for many disease conditions Year wise break-up for the four components is given below: (Rs. In Crores) S.

Two key components approved under the grant involving ULBs are: a) Urban Health and Wellness Centres : A paradigm shift in urban primary healthcare is envisaged, based on the learning from the managementof the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected urbanareas disproportionately. As part of this shift, UniversalComprehensive Primary Health Care is planned to beprovided through urban Health and Wellness Centres(urban-HWCs) and polyclinics. Such urban HWCswould enable decentralized delivery of primaryhealthcare to smaller populations, thereby increasingthe reach to cover the vulnerable and marginalised. Itis envisaged that the urban HWCs would create amechanism for representatives of the MedicalAdministrative Staff and Resident Welfare Associationsto disseminate information on public health issues atleast once a month. The FC-XV proposes to providesupport for setting up urban HWCs in closecollaboration with urban local bodies b) Support for diagnostic infrastructure to the primary healthcare facilities : The FC-XV provides support for diagnosticinfrastructure in urban PHCs under the vision ofcomprehensive primary health care. Diagnostic servicesare critical for the delivery of health services, and thesegrants are intended to fully equip the primary healthcarefacilities so that they can provide some necessarydiagnostic services.

Thissupport is over and above the routine oxygensupport available at such facilities through othersources (like State governments, NHM, ECRPetc.). b) Accordingly, so far, 74,469 Oxygen Concentrators have been allocated to variousStates as on 14.09.2021. c) MoHFW is coordinating with the MoPNG/ ONGC for the effective implementation of thisintervention. d) Guidance Note has been shared with the States to provide guidance to the States/UTs for anorganized and rational distribution, managementof these concentrators. 21) Focus on Quality under NHM during 2021-22 a) Revision of Operational Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Public Healthcare Facilities The National Health Mission (NHM) strives to providequality healthcare services toall citizens of the countryin an equitable manner. In this strategic direction,operational guidelines for ensuring quality assurancein public health facilities were launched by the Ministryof Health and Family Welfare in 2013. Since the launchof the guidelines and National Quality AssuranceStandards, the country has achieved significantoutcomes in ensuring that delivered services at publichealth facilities are safe, effective, patient-centred, andresponsive to the population's needs. However, over the years, the quality assurance programme has expanded its scope from RMNCHAANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 48in District Hospitals to all services at all Public Health Facilities. The revised guidelines focus on the emergingrequirements and responses to newer initiatives suchas LaQshya, AEFIs, Kayakalp, Patient Safety,MeraAspataal, HWCs, etc. Taken up by the MoHFWto further strengthen the public health system. Also,the institutional framework has been further reinforcedin delineating roles and responsibilities for standardsetting, certification process and surveillance.Guidelines name is changed to \"Operational Guidelinesfor Improving Quality in Public Healthcare Facilities2021\" with emphasis on Improvement activities forstrengthening the QA mechanism through integratedQuality Management System b ) MusQan-Ensuring the Child-friendly Services in Public Health Facilities India has made considerable progress in improving the survival of newborn & children and a major reasonfor this achievement is the massive scale-up ofcommunity and facility-based care that is beingprovided for newborn & children. Although effortsover past decades have minimized adverse outcomes,the quality of care provided in public healthcare facilitiesis still a challenge. To ensure the focus on improving quality parameters in Pediatric services MusQan scheme was launchedwithin the ambit of the NQAS framework.The aim ofthe initiative is to ensure that every child (0-12years)will get safe and child-friendly services. UnderMusQan, multi-pronged strategies have been adoptedfor ensuring that gaps in SNCU/NBSU, Pediatric careunits, NRCs, Pediatric OPDs against quality standardsare identified and traversed within the shortest possibletime. The initiative would play a pivotal role in contextualizing and formulating the country's commitment toaccelerating and improving newborn & child survival. c)National Quality Assurance Standards for Health & Wellness Centre-Sub Centre(HWC-SC): Delivery of Quality Health Servicesin Public Health Facilities is a stated commitmentunder National Health Mission. For improving theQuality-of-care National Quality AssuranceStandards for Different levels (District Hospitals,Community Health Centres, Primary HealthCentre, and Urban Primary Health Centre) ofhealth facilities are already in place. Recently,National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS)for Health & Wellness Centre Subcentre werelaunched to ensure the provision of expandedrange of services (as per 12 packages) in HWC.The NQAS is also focused on ensuring acontinuum of care that is accessible, acceptable,safe, effective, efficient, and as per people's needsand preferences. 1.2.3 NA TIONAL URBAN HEALTH MISSION 1) Introduction National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) was approved on 1st May, 2013 as a sub-mission under an overarching National Health Mission (NHM),NRHM being the other sub-mission. NUHM envisagesstrengthening the primary health care delivery systemsin urban areas and for providing equitable and qualityprimary health care services to the urban populationwith special focus on slum dwellers and vulnerablepopulation. It also seeks to de-congest secondary andtertiary health care facilities (District Hospitals/Sub-District Hospitals/Community Health Centre) byproviding robust comprehensive Primary health careservices in urban areas. NUHM covers all cities and towns with more than 50,000 populations and district headquarters and Stateheadquarters with more than 30,000 population. Theremaining cities/ towns continue to be covered underNational Rural Health Mission (NRHM). As part ofAyushman Bharat, the existing UPHCs are beingstrengthened as Health & Wellness Centres (HWCs)to provide preventive, promotive and curative servicesin cities closer to the communities.ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 49 Under NUHM, the Centre-State funding pattern is 60:40 for all the states w.e.f. FY 2015-16, except allNorth-Eastern and Himachal Uts, from FY 2017-18, the funding patternof UT of Delhi and Puducherry has been revised to60:40 and rest of the Uts without legislature are fullyfunded by Central Government. Implementation of NUHM is through the State Health Department or the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). Inseven metropolitan cities, viz., Mumbai, New Delhi,Chennai, andAhmedabad the implementation is through the ULBs.For the other cities, the State Health Departmentdecides whether the NUHM is to be implementedthrough them or the other urban local bodies. So far,1162 cities have been covered under NUHM in 35States/Uts except UT of Lakshadweep which iscovered under NHM. 2) Components of NUHM a) Service Delivery Infrastructure NUHM envisages setting up of service delivery infrastructure which is largely absent in cities/towns tospecially address the healthcare needs of urban poorand provides: /g122Urban - Primary Health Centre (U-PHC): U-PHCs to be established as per norm of one U-PHC for approximately 30,000 to 50,000urban population. The U-PHCs are preferably belocated within or near a slum for providingpreventive, promotive and OPD (consultation),basic lab diagnosis, and /g122Urban-Community Health Centre (U-CHC) : One U-CHC to be established for every 2.5 lakhpopulation (in non-metro cities above 5 lakhpopulation) and for every 5 lakh population inmetro cities. It would provide in-patient servicesand would be a 30-50 bedded facility. For themetro cities, the U-CHCs may be established forevery 5 lakh population with 100 beds b) Outreach services: NUHM also support engagement of ANMs forconducting outreach services for targeted groupsparticularly slum dwellers and the vulnerablepopulation for providing preventive and promotivehealthcare services at the household andcommunity level. c) Community Process: Following targeted interventions are envisagedunder NUHM for the slum dwellers and urbanpoor population: /g122One ASHA per 1,000-2,500 population covering approximately 200-500 households toserve as an effective, demand-generating linkbetween the health facility and the urban slumpopulation. /g122Mahila Arogya Samiti (MAS) per 250-500 population covering approximately 50-100households to act as community-based peereducation group in slums. They would be involvedin community mobilization, monitoring and referralwith focus on preventive and promotive care. d) Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs). To ensure delivery of Comprehensive Primary HealthCare (CPHC) services under Health and WellnessCentre component of Ayushman Bharat, the existingUPHCs are being strengthened as Health and WellnessCentres (HWCs). Support for training of PHC staff(Medical Officers, Staff Nurses, Pharmacist, and LabTechnicians), necessary IT infrastructure and theresources required for upgrading laboratory andANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 50diagnostics for expanded ranges of services is being provided to the States. So, far 4127 HWCs have beenmade operationalized in urban areas as on27.09.2021.Training and review workshops wereconducted for roll-out of CPHC-HWC in urban areasin collaboration with NHSRC. 3) ACHIEVEMENTS OF NUHM: a. Physical Progress:The programme is being implemented in the States/ Uts for more than 7 years period and accounts forpresence of augmented infrastructure and humanresources dedicated towards urban areas.

Release of HMIS Logo during HMIS National WorkshopANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 55 ANMOL is a tablet-based application which empowers ANMs - the frontline health workers in carrying out their day to day work efficiently andeffectively by entering and updating service records of beneficiaries on real / near real time basis. Further, ANMOL also acts as a job aid to the ANMs byproviding them with readily available information such as due list, dashboard and guidance based on data entered etc. This standardizes the maternal andchildcare services provided by ANMs who can also plan the Village Health and Nutrition Day (VHND) along with vaccines and logistics required. Audio andvideo counselling facility of ANMOL helps in creating awareness among beneficiaries about the various government schemes and facilitates beneficiaries aregetting authentic knowledge about family planning, pregnancy and child care. ANMOL application was launched by Hon'ble Union Minister of Health andFamily Welfare on 7th April, 2016. ANMOL is presently operational 24 and Uttarakhand. It has been implemented in three different languages i.e.English, Hindi and Kannada. The ANMOL application is being used by more than 97,883 ANMs since inception and remaining ANMs are under process for using ANMOL live application as per Standard Operating Procedures of MoHFW.To enhance the performance of ANMOL, an ANMOL Intermediate Server (AIS) for ANMOL has been implemented for seamless data integration andsynchronization. ToT for ANMOL is completed at 6 States/UTs and they shall be live shortly viz. Ladakh, Lakshadweep, Sikkim, Meghalaya, Nagalandand Mizoram.1.2.7 MOTHER AND CHILD TRACKING FACILITATION CENTRE (MCTFC) Mother and Child Tracking Facilitation Centre (MCTFC) was set up at National Institute of Healthand Family Welfare (NIHFW) and it went live on 29thApril, 2014. It is a major step taken by Governmentof India under the National Health Mission in improvingthe maternal and child health care services. The centre is operational with 86 Helpdesk Agents (HAs) 2 Medical Specialist, 2 Supervisors and fewmore administrative and IT staff. MCTFC is a tool forproviding relevant information and guidance directlyto the pregnant women, parents of children and tocommunity health workers, thus creating awarenessamong them about health services and promotinghealthy practices and behaviour. The centre contactsthe service providers and recipients of mother and childcare services to get their feedback on various motherand child care services, programmes and initiatives likeJSSK, JSY , RBSK and contraceptive distribution byASHAs etc. MCTFC validates and verifiesrecords of beneficiaries and workers. Thefeedback helps the MoHFW / State/ UT Governmentsto easily and quickly evaluate the programmeinterventions and plan appropriate corrective measuresto improve the health service delivery. Inbound calling has been implemented with short code 10588 to resolve the queries of beneficiaries and healthworkers. At MCTFC, the helpdesk agents also checkwith ASHAs and ANMs regarding availability ofessential drugs and supplies like Iron Folic Acid, ORSpackets, contraceptives etc. Information relating toupcoming programmes, initiatives, validation of data,etc. is also provided to the beneficiaries and healthworkers.

The first round ofNFHS was conducted in 1992-93, followed bysubsequent rounds in 1998-99, 2005-06 and 2015-16. The field work for the current round i.e., NFHS-5 with reference period 2019-21 has been completed.The State/UT fact sheets for 22 Phase-I States/UTshave been released by Hon'ble HFM and are availablein public domain while the process for release of Indiaand remaining 14 Phase-II States/UTs is in progressand will be released shortly. To meet the requirement of National, State and District level information, the Ministry needed to monitor theperformance of health programmes/ schemes at closerintervals. Therefore, a decision was taken to conductone integrated survey with a periodicity of three yearsin place of different surveys of similar nature (NationalFamily Health Survey, District Level Household andFacility Survey, Annual Health Survey etc.) that werethen carried out by the Ministry. In line with thisdecision, the 4 th round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) was conducted in 2015-16 as anintegrated survey with a six-fold increase in samplesize for providing estimates of key health and familywelfare indicators at the National, State and Districtlevels besides information on the levels of fertility,nutrition, infant and child mortality by backgroundcharacteristics at State/National level. Compared to the earlier NFHS (i.e. NFHS-1, NFHS- 2, NFHS-3); which provided only National and Statelevel estimates, NFHS-4 and NFHS-5 also provideddistrict level estimates which are available in the publicdomain. They provide essential data on nutrition, HFWneeded by the Central and State Governments andother stakeholders for effective policy and programmeinterventions. Further, NFHS-5 results also providebaseline information for the 34 indicators while NFHS-4 provided for 28 SDG indicators. The survey hasemerged as a major data source for tracking theprogress at dis-aggregated levels towards at all ages\"; and SDG 5\"Gender Equality\". The activities of current round of NFHS (NFHS-5) are in progress with 2019-21 as the reference periodcollecting data from more than 6.36 lakh samplehouseholds. The field work is planned in two phasescovering about half the country in each phase with anaim to provide district level estimates for most of theindicators for all 707 districts (as of March, 2017). Asin the case of previous rounds of NFHS, InternationalInstitute for Population Sciences (IIPS) is the NodalAgency for conducting NFHS-5. The scope of NFHS-5 has been modified in respect of target populationranges and age reference to align them as per SDGsrequirement. Thus expanded age range of 15+ yearsis being considered for non-communicable diseases(e.g. Diabetes, Hypertension etc.) and also for theirrisk factors. It has also been expanded by includingquestions inter-alia on disability, collection of DriedBlood Sample (DBS) for carrying out tests for Malaria,HbA1C, Vitamin-D and measurement of waist/ hipcircumferences, etc.ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 57 The main survey field work for NFHS-5 has been completed in all sample PSUs. The States and Districtfactsheets comprising estimates of key indicators for22 Phase-I States/UTs have been released be Hon'bleHFM on the occasion of Universal Health CoverageDay on 12.12.2020 and uploaded in the website ofMoHFW and IIPS. Release of NFHS-5 compendium of factsheets 24.11.2021 As regards Phase-II, the main survey field work wasstarted in January, 2020 but was halted for aroundeight months due to the COVID-19 pandemic inducedlockdown and was finally completed in April, 2021.The process for release of India and remaining 14Phase-II States/UTs factsheets have been initiated andunder due consideration of Ministry. The preparatory activity for the next round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-6) scheduledto be held during 2023-24 has already been initiatedby the Ministry. As in the previous rounds, theInternational Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)has been nominated as the nodal agency for conductingNFHS-6. Also for smooth implementation of thesurvey work, the four committees viz., SteeringCommittee, Financial Management Committee(FMC), Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) andProject Management Committee(PMC) have beenconstituted by the ministry. 1.2.9 POPULATION RESEARCH CENTRES (PRCs) The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW),Government of India, has established 18 PopulationResearch Centres (PRCs) in various universities andresearch institutions in the country with the mandate toprovide critical research based input on the field ofdemography, especially concerning the Health andFamily Welfare Programs and Policies at the Nationaland State levels.

India's MMRhas fallen faster than the global decline and is on trackto achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3) of an MMR below 70 by 2030. 1.3.2 MA TERNAL MORTALITY RATIO (MMR) MMR in the country has declined from 130in 2014-16 to 113 in 2016-18. Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) in India wasexceptionally high in 1990 with 556 women dyingduring child birth per 1,00,000 live births.Approximately, 1.38 lakh women were dying everyyear on account of complications related to pregnancyand child birth. The global MMR at the time was muchlower at 385. There has however, been an accelerateddecline in MMR in India. MMR in the country hasdeclined from 130 in 2014-16 to 113 in 2016-18.India's share among global maternal deaths hasdeclined significantly as per the MMEIG (MaternalMortality Estimation Inter-agency Group) Report. /g122As per MMEIG report, maternal deaths aroundthe world dropped from about 4,51,000 in 2000to an estimated 2,95,000 in 2017. This equatesto an estimated global MMR of 211 per 100,000live births, down from 342 in 2000, a 38 per centreduction. /g122Globally, the World's MMR fell by nearly 45%over the past 27 years, to an estimated 211maternal deaths per 1,00,000 live births in 2017,from an MMR of 385 in 1990 at an averageannual decline of 1.7%, while India recorded adecline of 78% reduction in maternal deaths over27 years. Maternal Mortality-India & Global Trend of MMR in India ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 59 Following are the global and national targets for MMR: /g122As per the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)-3, MMR to be less than 70 per 1,00,000live births by 2030/g122As per NHP (National Health Policy) 2017, thetarget for MMR is 100 per 1,00,000 live birthsby 2020.

C. Intensified Diarrhoea Control Fortnight (IDCF) Campaign:To increase awareness about useof ORS and Zinc in diarrhoea- an Intensified DiarrhoeaControl Fortnight (IDCF) is being observed duringmonsoon season, with the ultimate aim of 'zero childdeaths due to childhood diarrhoea'. During thefortnight, health workers visit the households of Under-5 children, conduct community level awarenessgeneration activities and distribute ORS packets to thefamilies with children Under-5 years of age.In 2021, ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 77 diarrhoea prevention and management activities under IDCF were conducted in all the States/UTs followingCOVID-19 protocols wherein, approximately 8 crorechildren up to five years of age were provided withORS and Zinc D. Anaemia Mukt Mukt achieve the envisaged target of 3% reduction inanaemia prevalence every year under the POSHANAbhiyaan. The strategy recommends 6x6x6 strategyto reduce anaemia prevalence (nutritional and non-nutritional) in six age groups namely pre-school children(6-59 months), children (5-9 years), adolescent girlsand boys (10-19 years), pregnant women, lactatingwomen and in women of reproductive age group (15-49 years) in programme mode through life cycleapproach. The six interventions under Anaemia Mukt Bharat iron intensified year-round behaviour change communication campaignincluding delayed cord clamping, testing and treatmentof anaemia using digital methods and point of caretreatment, mandatory provision of iron folic acidfortified foods in public health programmes andaddressing non-nutritional causes of anaemia inendemic pockets, with special focus on malaria,haemoglobinopathies and fluorosis. The six institutionalmechanisms are inter-ministerial coordination, nationalAnemiaMukt Bharat unit, national centre of excellenceand advanced research on anaemia control,convergence with other ministries, strengthening supplychain and logistics, Anaemia Bharat dashboardand digital portal - shop for anaemia. To address anaemia in children, bi-weekly IFA supplements are provided to children aged 6-59months through ASHAs and Weekly IFA supplementsto children of 5-10 years and adolescents 10-19 yearsof age. 180 doses of IFA supplements are also beingprovided to pregnant and lactating women during ANCand PNC period, respectively. Bi-annual Vitamin-ASupplementation is being done for all children belowfive years of age. During FY 2021-22 (till September,2021), the achievements under IFA supplementationis as follows: a. 2 crore children of age group 6-59 months were provided 8-10 doses of Iron Folic Acid (IFA) Syrup every month. b. 1.9 crore children of age group 5-9 years were provided 4-5 IFA Pink tablets every month. c. 3 crore children of age group 10-19 years were provided 4-5 IFA Blue tablets every month. d. 1.3 crore pregnant women and 0.6 crore lactating women were provided 180 IFA Red tablets duringANC and PNC respectively.

G . Lactation Management Centres breastfeeding not possible,ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 78the options are expressed mother's own milk, donor human milk and formula feed. Feeding with humanbreast milk provides optimum nutrition, infectionprevention, improves neuro-developmental growth,reduced hospital stay and economic benefits whereasfeeding formula milk is associated with high risk ofsepsis and Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC). LactationManagement Centre ensures availability of safepasteurized donor human milk at ComprehensiveLactation Management Centres (CLMCs) andexpressed mother's own breast milk suitable forfeeding sick, preterm and low birth weight babies atall levels. The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare under NHM has initiated establishment of Lactation ManagementCentres in public health facilities at three levels: i)CLMC (Medical Colleges/high load DistrictHospitals), ii) Lactation Management Unit (DistrictHospitals/Sub-District Hospitals), and iii) Lactationsupport Unit (Delivery points) for ensuring human milkfor sick, preterm and low birth weight babies admittedin intensive care units such as NICU and SNCUs.CLMC provide all facilities to ensure that donor humanmilk is expressed, collected, processed and dispensedfree of cost for feedingof sick, preterm and low birthweight babies admitted in intensive care units such asNICU and SNCUs following the most appropriatetechnology and standard protocol. All these standardprotocols and safety measures for these processes areelaborated in the \"National Guidelines on Lactation Management Centres in Public Health Facilities\"published by MoHFW. As of FY 2020-2021 (uptoSeptember, 2020), and 3 LMUs areestablished in seven States. 1.4.4 UNIVERSAL IMMUNIZATION PROGRAMME (UIP) /g122Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) in Indiais one of the largest public health programmes inthe world. It targets around 3.04 crore pregnantwomen and 2.67 crore newborn annually. Morethan 1.2 crore immunization sessions areconducted annually./g122It is one of the most cost effective public healthinterventions and largely responsible for reductionof vaccine preventable Under-5 mortality rate. /g122Launched in 1978 as an expanded programmeon immunization, it got its present name of\"Universal Immunization Programme (UIP)\" in1985 when its reach was expanded beyond urbanareas. In 1992, it became part of Child Survivaland Safe Motherhood Programme and in 1997and it came under the ambit of NationalReproductive and Child Health Programme. UIPis an integral part of National Rural Health Missionsince its launch in 2005. /g122The National Technical Advisory Group onImmunisation (NTAGI) is the apex advisory bodyon immunization in the country. It providesguidance and advice to MoHFW on provision ofvaccination and immunization services for theeffective control of vaccine preventable diseases. /g122Under UIP, the Government of India is providingvaccination free of cost against twelve vaccinepreventable diseases, of which: a) Eleven vaccines are provided across the country against Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Polio,Measles, Rubella, severe form of ChildhoodTuberculosis, Rota virus diarrhea, Hepatitis B,Meningitis & Pneumonia caused by HemophilusInfluenza Type B and Pneumococcal pneumonia b) Only Japanese Encephalitis (JE) vaccine is is provided sub nationally in endemic districts. /g122A child needs seven contacts with the health facilitytill the age of five years to complete immunizationunder UIP. The detailed immunization scheduleage-wise as well as vaccine-wise is given atAnnexure. /g122A child is said to be fully immunized if he/shereceives all due vaccines as per nationalimmunization Schedule within 1 styear of the age of the child.ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 79 /g122There are three main systems to measure full immunization coverage: 1. Online web-based Health Management Information System (HMIS) portal whereinadministrative coverage is being reported throughhealth facilities across the country. As per HMISdata for FY 2020-21, the full immunizationcoverage of the country stands at 88.05% (Aprilto October 2021 as on 10 th December, 2021). 2. Periodic surveys like National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - As per NFHS-5 (2019-2021),the full immunization coverage in the country standsat 76.4%. 3. Concurrent monitoring of the Universal Immunization Programme is conducted throughsessions as well as community monitoring. The trends in Full Immunization coverage (FIC) over the past years is as follows: Survey NFHS-3 DLHS-3 system of cold chain equipment is utilized tostore vaccine and deliver the immunizationservices from fixed centres or out-reach sessionsutilizing the following infrastructure: /g122Sub-Centres: around 1.5 lakhs, Healthfacilities) & Deep equipment to store vaccines, /g122Solar Direct Drive (SDDs) - 441 - Equipment tostore vaccine /g122District Vaccine Stores: around 736 vaccine stores /g122WIC & WIF: 436 - cold and freezer rooms tostore vaccines at bulk storage locations. Routine Immunization Coverage andStrengthening Under Routine Immunization, routinely head count survey is conducted and microplanning is done,immunization services are provided through facilitybased and outreach sessions. Various communitymobilization activities are undertaken to address thevarious reasons because of which eligible children maybe left out or drop out. Some of the periodicimmunization intensification activities which areundertaken from time to time are as follows: 1) MISSION INDRADHANUSHa) To increase the rate of increase of full immunization coverage to ensure no child is left without the benefit of vaccines, the Government of Indialaunched Mission Indradhanush in December2014 with an aim to increase the full immunizationcoverage to at least 90% and sustain the gainsthrough Routine Immunization b) Mission Indradhanush is a targeted approach focused to reach all left out and dropped outchildren in pockets of low immunization coverage(like hard to reach areas, vacant Sub- Centres,areas with recent outbreaks of vaccinepreventable diseases, resistance pockets etc.). c) Mission Indradhanush has completed ten phases (from April 2015 to March 2021) covering 701Districts wherein: i. 3.86 crore children were reached ii. 96.8 lakh pregnant females were immunizedANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 80d) The detailed phase-wise coverage of Mission Indradhanush is given in Table No.4.7. e) As per report of Integrated Child Health and Immunization Survey (INCHIS), the first two phases of Mission Indradhanush have led to anincrease of 6.7% in full immunization coverage inone year as compared to 1% increase/year in thepast. This increase was more in rural areas (7.9%)as compared to urban areas (3.1%). 2) Intensified Mission Indradhanush: a) During the review of Mission Indradhanush in Pro- Active Governance and Timely Implementation (PRAGATI) meeting on 26 thApril 2017, directions were received to achieve the goal of90% FIC b) Accordingly, MoHFW identified 121 Districts, 17 urban areas and 52 Districts of North EasternStates (total 190 Districts/urban areas across 24States) where Intensified Mission Indradhanushwas conducted, which was launched by theHon'ble Prime Minister of India on 8 th October, 2017 at Vadnagar, Gujarat. c) The activity was monitored closely by the Prime Minister of India and Cabinet Secretary. d) Intensified Mission Indradhanush involved intensive preparation, implementation andintegration of IMI sessions into RoutineImmunization microplans. e) Focus was on urban slum areas and districts with slowest progress, completion of due-list ofbeneficiaries on the basis of head-count surveys& greater convergence with other ministries/departments with defined roles. 3) Intensified Mission Indradhanush 3.0: a) In order to re-gain the achievements of past immunization drives and to accomplish the vision of 90% FIC and sustain thereafter, plan forstrengthening routine immunization and catch upon the gaps that might have emerged due toCOVID-19 pandemic, was developed. Two rounds of Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI)3.0 were carried out from February 2021-March 2021in a total of 250 Districts which were identified across29 States/UTs, wherein a total of 9,54,406 childrenand 2,24,161 pregnant women were vaccinated. Further, many other steps were taken to mitigate negative impacts of COVID-19 onvaccinationservices, these include: i. Developing and disseminating guidelines: A national guideline to safelycontinue immunisation services during the COVID-19 pandemic,includingconduct of Polio SupplementaryImmunisation Activities (SIAs) was developed ii.

Children in the age group of 0-5 years wereadministered Polio drops during National and Sub-national immunization rounds (in high risk areas) everyyear. There are 24 lakh vaccinators and 1.5 lakhsupervisors involved in the successful implementationof the Pulse Polio Programme across the country.About 167 million children are immunized across thecountry during each National Immunization Day (NID)and 75 million in SNIDs. 1) Progress On 24th February, 2012, WHO removed India from the list of countries with active endemic wild polio virus transmission after reporting of last case of poliovirusin country in January, 2011. Subsequently, on 27 th March, 2014, India along with 10 other countries ofSouth-East Asia Region was declared Polio-free bythe Regional Certification Commission (RCC) ofWHO. The issued certificate stated that \"TheCommission concludes, from the evidence providedby the National Certificate Committees of the 11Member States, that the transmission of indigenouswild Polio virus has been interrupted in all countries ofthe Region\". India has maintained Polio-free status as no wild polio virus case has been reported for more than10 yearsafter last case reported on 13 thJanuary, 2011.Pulse Polio NID by Hon'ble President of India on 30.01.2021 at Rashtrapati BhavanANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 86Last Reported Polio Case Polio Virus Date of Location Type last case P1 13 January , Howrah (Panchla), 2011 West Bengal P2 The total number of cases and number of affected districts during past 10 years Y ear Cases of Number of Polio Districts 2006 676 114 2007 874 99 2008 559 90 2009 741 56 2010 42 17 2011 01 01 2012 00 00 2013 00 00 2014 00 00 2015 00 00 2016 00 00 2017 00 00 2018 00 00 2019 00 00 2020 00 00 2021 00 00 Data as on: 25th December, 20212) Steps to maintain Polio free status To maintain the Polio free status, the country is implementing the following strategies: a) Maintaining community immunity through high quality of National and Sub National Polio rounds each year, apart from routine immunization. b) Polio vaccination is provided to all eligible children round the clock through more than 70 specialbooths set up at international borders (both Railand Road routes) those shares with India i.e.Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal andMyanmar. In these border posts, more than 1.48crore children were vaccinated as on 31 st August, 2021. c) Travel advisory has been issued for Polio vaccination of international travelers between Indiaand 8 other countries i.e. Pakistan, Afghanistan,Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Syria andCameroon. MoHFW ensured that all the travelersfrom Afghanistan who came to India during July-August 2021 got vaccinated with one dose of fIPVand bOPV . Till December, 2021 nearly 3 lakhtravellers have been vaccinated with OPV . d) An Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan (EPRP) have been put in place under which RapidResponse Teams (RRT) are set up in every State/UTs for timely action in case of any occurrenceof a Polio case in the country. e) As a part of Polio Endgame Strategy, India has introduced Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) acrossthe country to provide double protection againstPolio. f) Strengthening Acute Flaccid Surveillance (AFP) across the country and supplementarysurveillance in the form of which actsas surrogate indicator for Polio virustransmission. g) The lessons learnt from Polio programme is being implemented for strengthening of routineimmunization by carrying out Immunizationweeks and also the same learnings are being usedfor Indradhanush\" andrecently coverage ofIndia. 3) Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs) Surveillance Currently, the following surveillance systems arepresent in India for VPD surveillance: AFP (Acute Flaccid Paralysis) Surveillance : a) AFP (Acute Flaccid Paralysis) surveillance is the gold standard for detecting cases of Poliomyelitis. This is done to identify all reservoirsof wild Poliovirus and vaccine derived Polio virustransmission. This includes reporting of all AFPcases, investigating them and laboratory testingof all stool specimens collected from such casesfor Polio viruses in specialized laboratories. Morethan 49,000 health facilities report children withAFP to the surveillance system. In 2019, 40364AFP cases were reported, in 2020 21,169 AFPcaseswere reported and in 2021 (till 25 December2021), 23,829 AFP caseshave been reported inthe country. b) There are 8 WHO accredited laboratories in India for primary isolation of Polio virus (wild Polio virusand vaccine derived Polio virus), followed byIntratypic Differentiation (ITD) of isolates fromAFP cases, if indicatedc) These Kasauli, KIPM Chennai, and SGPGILucknow. d) Besides above eight, there are two laboratories PMC Patna and IPM Hyderabad which do theconcentration of sewage samples collected forenvironmental surveillance for poliovirus. e) The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the AFP surveillance performance across the country. Asof week 51 of 2021, the AFP rate for country is5.3 (still above the global recommended level of2 cases per 100 000 under 15 population). In2019, the AFP rate was 9.1 per 1,00,000 under15 population while in 2020 was 4.7. Stooladequacy (% AFP cases with 2 stool specimenswithin 14 days of paralysis onset) in 2019 was87% in 2019, 82% in 2020 while it is 86% in2021 (data till 25 th December, 2021). f) MoHFW has sent detailed guidelines to all the States/UTs on how to conduct VPD surveillance(AFP, MR and DPT) activities during ongoingCOVID-19 pandemic. g) To supplement AFP surveillance, environmental surveillance has been established at 58 sitesspread over in 12 States. Measles-Rubella (MR) Surveillance: India is making significant progress towards the goal of measles and rubella elimination. Key strategies forachieving elimination are described in the NationalStrategic Plan for Achieving and Sustaining Measlesand Rubella Elimination in India, and include: h) Achieving and sustaining 95% coverage with two doses of measles and rubella containing vaccine (MRCV) i) Establishing a sensitive and timely measles and rubella (MR) surveillance system j) Maintaining an accredited MR laboratory networkANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 88k) Ensuring adequate outbreak preparedness and responding rapidly to measles and rubella outbreaks l) Strengthening support and linkages to achieve the above strategies MR surveillance started in India as laboratory supported outbreak-based surveillance in 2005, andwas expanded to all states by 2015 in a phased manner.In 2016, India began transitioning from MR outbreak-based surveillance to WHO laboratory supported MRcase-based surveillance starting with the state ofKarnataka and expanding to all states by 2019. Apilot of fever and rash (FR) surveillance, with abroadened case definition, was started in Karnataka(2018),Madhya Pradesh and Odisha(2019) and wasinitiated across country in 2021. A sensitive case-based surveillance system is essential to monitor progress towards the elimination of measlesand rubella. The objective of MR case-basedsurveillance is to detect, investigate, and classify allsuspected cases and to respond to confirmedoutbreaks. This will help in timely detection of evenlow levels of measles and rubella transmission, andwill also help to ensure timely implementation of keyresponse measures, such as active case searches andadministration of vitamin A, to reduce morbidity andmortality. In addition, MR surveillance data generatedon state specific epidemiology will guide futureimmunization strategies across the country includingplanning for supplementary immunization activities. There are >49,000 reporting sites across the country in the reporting network, which includes private sector,non-formal sector, and temples in addition to governmenthealth facilities.

The initial effortsunder the program were focused on populationstabilization. Over the years' the benefits of familyplanning were realized globally. Family Planning is nowa well recognized intervention to improve maternal andchild health. In fact, the benefits go beyond health as itimpacts all 17 sustainable development goals (directlyor indirectly). It is also one of the most cost effectivesolutions for achieving gender equity. V oluntary familyplanning brings transformational benefits to women,families, communities, and countries. Family planningaffects people in myriad ways. Most fundamentally, itadvances human rights. It helps women and men securetheir rights to decide freely, and for themselves,whether, when, and how many children they want tohave a basic human right. International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) held in year 1994 at Cairo, Egyptled to a paradigm shift in the implementation of Familywelfare programme. In 1996, the new approach hada very strong reproductive health orientation and thetarget based approach was replaced by a decentralizedcommunity need assessment approach. The program has come a long way and currently it is being repositioned to not only achieve populationstabilization but also to reduce maternal mortality andinfant and child mortality. Reproductive health is oneof the foremost pillars under RMNCAH+N strategy. Paradigm Shift under National Family Planning Program: Addressing population growth has been a key priority for the Government of India. Birth control thus wasthe prime focus of the program in initial years. Overthe decades the program has evolved to the currentholistic and target free approach. The NationalPopulation Policy 2000 redefined the program as amedium of interventions for promoting reproductiveand child health. The figure explains how the strategic approach under National Family Planning Program has transformedover the years. An integrated quality service deliverywhich is client oriented is a mainstay of the program.The program focuses on assuring complete knowledgeand access to reproductive rights and services andenables women and men to make individualreproductive choices. The objectives, strategies and activities of the Program have been meticulously designed in line with the goalsand objectives of various policies (National PopulationPolicy 2000, National Health Policy 2002 and NationalHealth Policy 2017) and compliments India'scommitment at International Forums (viz. InternationalConference on Population and Development-ICPD,Sustainable Development Goals-SDG, FP2020/FP2030 and others). 1.5.2 Key reproductive health indicators: Population and demographic indicators: /g122As per Report of the Technical group onPopulation Projection-2019 by the RegistrarGeneral of India, the population of India isexpected to increase from 121.1 crores to 151.8crores during the period 2011-2036 - an increaseof 25 percent in twenty-five years at the rate of1.0 percent annually. /g122India has considerable State wise variations. Thereport states that out of the total projected increasein population of 31 crores in India during 2011-36, 50% is likely to occur in the five States of ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 94Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh. Nineteen percent of thetotal population increase in India during the sameperiod is anticipated to occur in Uttar Pradeshalone. The population in these five states togetheris expected to grow at 1.0 percent per annumduring 2011-36. /g122Crude Birth Rate: CBR has been witnessing acontinuous decline in the country. The current CBRas per SRS figures is 19.7 per 1000 population. Marriage and Fertility Indicators: /g122Total Fertility Rate (TFR): As per NFHS-5 (2019-21), India has achieved replacementfertility level 2.0). has declined inmost Kerala from1.6 (2.9) and Uttar Pradesh (2.4). Wanted Fertility Rates: The total wanted fertility rate in India has almost remained static [NFHS-3 (1.9) and NFHS-4 (1.8)]. However, thedifference between actual and wanted fertility havereduced by half from NFHS-3 to NFHS-4. The wanted fertility of women with no schooling is 2.3children as compared to 1.5 for women having highereducation levels. Similarly, women in high wealthquintiles have low wanted fertility (1.4) as comparedto women in lowest wealth quintile (2.3) (NFHS 4)./g122Teenage childbearing: The teenage births percentage declined from 7.9% in NFHS-4 to6.8% in NFHS-5. Teenage childbearing in urbanareas showed a decline of 1.2 % whereas in ruralareas a decline of 1.3 % is noted. NFHS-5datafurther show a decline in teenage birthsin to NFHS-5(from 26.8% to 23.3%). Bihar and Tripura (40.1%). Family Planning Indicators: Modern Contraceptive Use: Modern contraceptive use for India is 56.5%. The graph below shows the method mix for the country. ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 95 NFHS-5 estimates show animprovement of 1.9% in limiting methods. In urban areas, there isanimprovement of 0.5% whereas in rural areas theimprovement is 2.6%. A steady increase in use ofspacing methods has been noticed in rural areas andin total mCPR. NFHS-5results show a substantial improvement in the use of modern contraceptive method use (MCPR56.5%). Highest MCPR is reported by AndhraPradesh (70.8%), Karnataka (68.2%) and Telangana(66.7%). There is also a shift towards spacingmethods in all States/UTs except Ladakh andMizoram. Unmet Need for Family Planning: India's Unmet need for Family Planning is 9.4% as per NFHS-5. The data of NFHS-5 show a declining trend in unmetneed in 31States/UTs. Demand Satisfied by Modern Contraceptives:'Demand Satisfied' calculates the need satisfied by modern methods out of total demand in the community(includes the cohort using modern contraceptive andtraditional method and having unmet need forcontraception). India's demand satisfied shows anincrease from 72.0% in NFHS-4 74.2% inNFHS-5. Progress of global commitments (FP 2020 Commitments): India is one of the member countries of FP 2020 and made following commitments toadvance family planning efforts in the country: /g122Increasing financial commitment on family planningto more than 2 billion USD (Rs.12000 crores)from 2012 to 2020. /g122Ensuring access to family planning services to 48million (4.8 Crore) additional women by 2020(40% of the total FP 2020 target). /g122Sustaining the coverage of 100 million (10 Crore)women currently using contraceptives.

The population of thecountry increased from 36 Crores in 1951 to 121crores in 2011 as per Census data. The country is stillwitnessing a population growth and recent estimationsfrom RGI reveals that the current population is around136 crores. A look at the census figures of the last four decades indicates a perceptible decline in the growth rate ofthe population of India: Though India's population hasincreased over years, the country has witnessedsignificant decline in both fertility and mortality. Thecrude birth rate, which was recorded at 40.8 per 1000in 1951, has declined to 19.7 in 2019 (SRS), as perthe estimates available from the Sample RegistrationSystem (SRS). Total Fertility rate has come down from6.0 in 1951 to 2.0 in 2019-21 (NFHS-5). Trend in Population Growth- India As indicated in the graph, the growth of India'spopulation since independence was \"RAPID\" and theaverage annual population growth rate hovered around2% per year for almost four decades. The averageannual population growth rate shot up from around1.25% during 1941-51 to very close to 2% during1951-61 and to an all-time high of more than 2.2%during 1971-81. This rapid growth rate of thepopulation for almost 3 decades (from 1951 to 1980s)resulted in doubling of India's population (from 36 croreto 78 crore). After 1981, the trend in the populationgrowth rate was reversed. There has been a slowdownin the population growth in the recent past but the netaddition to the population continued to increase. Inanother 2.5 decades the population tripled and reachedat around 121 crores in 2011. Hon'ble MoS, Dr. Bharati Pravin Pawar, at Population Research Centre, Institute of Economic Growth, New Delhi on 10.09.2021 Inauguration of Population Clock by Hon'ble MoS, Health & Family Welfare on 10.9.2021 ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 107 India has achieved replacement level fertility (TFR 2.0 in NFHS-5). Out of 36 States/UTs, 31 States/UTshave achieved TFR of less than 2.1. NFHS-5 (2019-21) shows significant improvementin family planning. The pace of population growth in India has been slowing down over the decades. The percentagedecadal growth during 2001-2011 fell by 3.9%compared to 2.5% in the previous decade - thesharpest decline since independence. Average annualexponential growth rate in 1991, 2001 and 2011 were2.16%, 1.97% and 1.64%, respectively. Current Demographic Scenario: A sizable proportion of India's population is in the younger age group. As per Census 2011 report,approx. 17% of the population is in the age group 0-9years, 17.8% in the age group of 10-19 years and9.3% in 50-59 years of age group while the percentageof 60 and above years of age group is approx. 10.1%. As per an estimate, India accounts for 27 million deliveries annually, out of which more than 60% of therecently added population would need to accessreproductive health services in the upcoming years.Though the government has drawn out comprehensivenational and state roadmaps and district action plansfocusing on the delivery of the services yet manywomen continue to have an unmet need for moderncontraceptives. Integration of services at all stages oflife with family planning services is imperative whichwould not only help India achieve its national TFR goalsbut also help ensure the provision of qualityreproductive health care in a holistic manner.Factors that influence population growth Key indicators that influence population growth are Crude Birth rate, Total Fertility rate, Unmet need forFamily Planning, Contraceptive Use, Spacing betweenBirths, Age at marriage and first child birth. The currentstatus, as per the latest available data, is as follows: Unmet need for Family Planning has declined from 12.9% (NFHS-4) to 9.4% (NFHS-5). India has anunmet need of 4.0% (spacing) and 5.4% (limiting).The urban rural differential is minimal (8.4%-Urbanand 9.9%-Rural). The unmet need is highest inMeghalaya (26.9%) Andhra Pradesh(4.7%). Pradesh (70.8%). NFHS-5 results have shown encouraging trends in modern contraceptive use key among which are: /g122Use of modern contraceptives has increasedsubstantially /g122Overall positive shift towards spacing methods(increase in all spacing methods). /g122IUCD use has shown an increase for the first timesince NFHS-1. /g122Injectable MPA use has also shown an increaseacross India. /g12229 States have >70% eligible couples in need ofcontraception (as against 12 states in NFHS 4)which shows that the FP demand generationactivities has shown a positive result. /g122Women married before age 18 declined from26.8% (NFHS-4) to 23.3% (NFHS-5).Moreover, out of the total births, 6.8% (NFHS-5) are among teenagers i.e. 15-19 years whichhas declined from 7.9% (NFHS-4). /g122Healthy Spacing between two childbirths(recommended period of 3 years or more) has ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 108increased from 42.6% (SRS 2012) to 50.4% (SRS 2018). Population projections for India: As per RGI Technical Group of Population Projections Report (2020), The population of India is expected toincrease from 121.1 crores to 151.8 crores during theperiod 2011-2036 - an increase of 25% in twenty-five years at the rate of 1.0% annually. The density ofpopulation will increase from 368 to 462 persons persquare kilometer. According to UN estimates, 75% of the population growth during 2001-2026 will be on account ofpopulation momentum. Population momentum isexpected to contribute to 100% of the populationincrease States - Gujarat, Assam, Haryana and only 50%of Madhya Pradesh andRajasthan. Population Stabilization is a stage when the size of the population remains unchanged. It is also calledthe stage of zero population growth. There is often agap of a few decades between achieving replacementlevel fertility i.e. TFR of 2.1 (two children per couple)and population stabilization. Population Momentum refers to the tendency of the population to continue growing beyond the time when the replacement fertility is achieved. Becauseof population momentum, there is a time lag betweenachieving replacement fertility and achievingpopulation stabilization. Additional increase in the population, which is between30-50%, is because of unmet needs and unwantedpregnancies in the high focus states. Window of Opportunity:'Window of opportunity' is closed for the southern States of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, TamilNadu, as well Bengal. For Gujarat, Maharashtra, Haryana,Odisha, North East except Assam the demographicwindow is likely to be closed within a year or so. Onthe other hand, it is likely to be open for another 10years levels of demographic advantage,the Districts within the States are at different stages ofdemographic transition. These are due to differentialrates of fertility and child mortality, experienced by theDistricts in a State. India's demographic advantage stems from its large young and economically active population. With 35.6Crore 10-24 year-old, India has the world' s largest young population. Investing in enhancement of human capabilities of young people can positivelyinfluence economic growth. Expanding social andeconomic opportunities for young girls and women inparticular can further accelerate development. India'syouth have the potential to shape social and economicdevelopment, contribute to progress in social normsand values, and build the foundation of India'ssustainable development. Furthermore, urbanpopulation growth and urbanisation can also beharnessed for contributing positively to sustainabledevelopment. India's policy response for addressing the population growth India was the first country to have a National Program on Family Planning in 1952. Various policyinterventions were taken from time to time to addressthe increasing population. The National Population Policy (NPP) was devised in the year 2000 with the immediate objective to addressthe unmet needs for contraception, health careinfrastructure, and health personnel, and to provideintegrated service delivery for basic reproductive andchild health care. The medium-term objective was tobring the TFR to replacement levels by 2010, throughvigorous implementation of inter-sectoral operationalstrategies. The long-term objective is to achieve a stablepopulation by 2045, at a level consistent with theANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 109 requirements of sustainable economic growth, social development, and environmental protection. The Government of India has been implementing the National Health Mission (NHM) in line with the policyframework of population stabilization as envisaged inNPP-2000, by helping to create a robust servicedelivery mechanism to address the unmet need for familyplanning. Government of India is also addressing thesocial determinants of health, paramount among whichare female literacy, women's empowerment and ageat marriage. The following commitments have been earmarked in the National Health Policy 2017 , highlighting the Government's focus in aiding the process of PopulationStabilization: - Reduction of TFR at National & Sub national level to 2.1 by 2025 - Reduction in MMR from current level to 100 by 2020 - Reduction in infant mortality to 28 by 2019The Government is committed to give focused attention to demographically weak performing states throughprovisioning of all kinds of support including publicawareness program under NHM, for which the Statesare free to project their priorities depending on thelocal needs to further the task of population stabilizationin the State specific project implementation plans. India's strategic actions for utilizing demographic dividend: As indicated in the sections above, owing to its high population India also has a demographic advantage.The country is strengthening its efforts to address thechallenges of population growth and strategizing in allfronts to address it. Increasing Youth Bulge- With increasing demographic window, the adolescent's cohort would be increasing. Close to 30% of India's population is inthe age group 0-14 years. The proportion, from 23% in Kerala to 37% in Bihar, indicatingvariation in young dependency ratio.Adolescent health has been included in India'sRMNCAH+N strategy for Reproductive, Maternal,Child, Adolescent Health and Nutrition to improve thenational health outcomes with dedicated RKSKprogram in place. Addition of Newer contraceptives in the available method mix has also given chance to young populationto exercise their choice Need of Geriatric Care - In southern States with the closure of window of opportunity the dependency ratio will increase rapidly in contrast to other States. Theelderly in the 60+ age group constitute a smallproportion (8.6%). This proportion varies from around6% in Delhi to 13% in Kerala. MoHFW is implementing the National Program on Non Communicable Disease (NCD) and National Program for Health Care of the Elderly (NPHCE)for improving access to promotional, preventive,curative and rehabilitative services to the elderly throughcommunity based primary health care approach. The country is also advancing to Universal Health Coverage model. Increased Urbanization- Urban agglomeration is increasing due to migration inclusion of new areasunder urban and increase in urban population. Theextent of urbanization varies enormously across thecountry. Bihar is the least urbanized state with 11%urban population and Delhi the most with 98%. Closeto 50% of the urban population is concentrated in thesix relatively high-income states of Gujarat, Karnataka,Maharashtra, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.Urban health mission is now an integral part of NationalHealth Mission. Family Planning strategies to address the reproductive health needs: /g122Special focus through MPV strategies in 146 highfertility Districts to improve access to moderncontraceptives and service provision therebyreducing the fertility levels.ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 110/g122Expansion of basket of choice for enhanced service provision /g122Dedicated FP commodity software pan India forensuring commodity security till the last mile /g122Community based schemes (HDC, ESB, PTK)for better accessibility of contraceptives Stabilizing population is an essential requirement forpromoting sustainable development. Makingreproductive health care accessible is the foundationfor stabilizing population. In addition to various otherparameters, population stabilization helps instrengthening human capital by focusing on healthinclusive of sexual and reproductive rights of themasses. Perceptible Decline in Population and related indicators (Over the last 5 decades) The improved quality and coverage of health care coupled with technologically advanced care and thepenetration of various health programmes across thecountry, both rural and urban, have resulted in a rapidfall in the Crude Birth Rate (CBR), Total Fertility Rate(TFR) and growth rate. The last 5 decades have seen significant improvements in the indicators: - Crude birth rate has declined from 40.8 per 1000 in 1951 to 19.7 in 2019 - Infant mortality rate has decreased from 146 in 1951-61 to 30 in 2019 - Total Fertility rate has declined from 6.0 in 1951 to 2.0 in 2019-20 - Steepest decline in decadal growth rate was recorded between 2001 and 2011 from 21.54% to 17.64% - Decline in 0-6 population by 3.08% compared to 2001 - 18.14 crores population was added during 2001- 2011 as compared to 18.23 crores during 1991-2001.- After decades of stagnation, there was a 4.1 percentage point fall in the growth rate ofpopulation, from 24.99% in 2001 to 20.92% Chhattisgarh,Rajasthan, Orissa Uttarakhand. The Government of India, through its multiple programsand policies, is well on the way to attaining populationstabilization in a reasonable time. 1.6 HEALTH POLICY AND Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana Over the past few decades there has been improvement in various health indicators of lndia. However, the Out-of-Pocket Expenditure, which pushes millions ofpeople into poverty every year, still remains a concern.In order to address this and provide health cover ofRs. 5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiarycare hospitalization to poor and vulnerable section The scheme aims to improveaffordability, accessibility, and quality of care for thepoor and vulnerable section of the population. Salient Features /g122Around 10.74 crore poor and vulnerable families (approximately 50 crore individuals) are entitledunder AB-PMJAY for cashless and paperlessaccess to services at the point of service i.e.empanelled hospitals.

In addition to the state level posts, DistrictImplementation Units (DIUs) have also beensetup to support the implementation in districts. Implementation Modes in States/UTs /g122States under AB-PMJAY are free to choose theimplementation mode and can implement thescheme either through a Trust, or InsuranceCompanies or a combination of both in a mixedmode. States can also cover a greater number offamilies than those defined as per SECC data.For these additional families, the cost needs to beborne by the States. These State Schemes workin alliance with the AB-PMJAY . /g122At present, 33 States/UTs are implementing thescheme.

Prior to launch of the scheme, onFebruary 1 st, 2018, the announcement was made in union budget of India. NHA was incorporated in themonth of May and PM announced the launch ofScheme on the 71 st Independence Day. Progress of the Scheme As on 17th November 2021, 33 States and Union Territories are implementing the scheme, where 17.11 Crore Ayushman cards have been issued under theScheme including those issued by the States using theirown IT platforms. Approximately 2.4 Crorehospitalizations amounting to almost Rs.28,300 Croreshave been authorized under the scheme. ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 113 Operational model States/UTs have been accorded considerable flexibility towards the design and implementation of the scheme.Including, State Health Agencies have flexibility withrespect to the mode of implementation, expansion ofbeneficiary base, scheme co-branding, increasing thecoverage beyond 5 lakhs, revision in package numbersand pricing (albeit within a limit) and choosing the ITplatform. Partnerships NHA has entered several partnerships with government, non-government, multilateral and not-for-profit organisations. The goal is to synergise knowledgeand skills in order to make the implementation of AB-PMJAY more effective. NHA has actively collaboratedwith the following organizations in order to make withimplementation of AB-PMJAY more effective. Theseinclude German Agency for International Cooperation(GIZ), The World Bank, World Health Organisation,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Clinton HealthAccess Initiative, National Skill DevelopmentCorporation, ICICI Foundation for Inclusive Growth,Asian Bank, Akshaya Patra Foundation, Novartis Social Business, NATHEALTH, WISH Foundation, Health SystemsTransformational Program - Public Health Foundationof India, Insurance Institute of India, Department ofHealth Research - National Cancer Grid, QualityCouncil of India, International Innovation Corps -University of Chicago. Key initiatives undertaken in Ayushman Bharat - PMJAY in 2021-22 Beneficiary Identification The BIS is one of the components of NHA's information technology backbone. It facilitatesverification of eligibility for beneficiaries through SECCor additional datasets through Application ProgrammeInterface (APIs) and supports Aadhaar eKYC(electronic Know Your Customer) and non-Aadhaarbased KYC for authentication. Towards this end,NHA launched a mission mode campaign \"AapkeDwar Ayushman\". Under this campaign NHA signedMoUs with leading service providers such as CSC e-Governance Services Ltd. and UTIITSL Ltd. to ensurefree issuance of cards to (SECC 2011) beneficiariesundergoing verification for the 1 st time. NHA actively collaborate with State Health Agencies to establishgrassroots network of Health Care Workers (HCWs)and Front-Line Workers (FLWs) to mobilizebeneficiaries. NHA also worked to create convergencewith Panchayati Raj institutions by enlisting them tomobilize beneficiaries. Creation of Hospital Network The supply of health care services under AB-PMJAY are ensured through pre-selected, well equipped andwell-prepared hospitals to deliver the benefits. Also,the hospitals must be distributed widely enough overthe geography so as to ensure optimal accessibility tothe eligible families. In order to cater to the increaseddemands under AB-PMJAY and also to ensure qualitycare to the beneficiaries, it is imperative to maintainand grow a network of hospitals that also conform tothe quality standards and criteria. Considering thesupply side characteristics, two types of empanelmentcriteria have been evolved. These criteria have beendeveloped based on the experience of the prevalentpractice in other Government-funded health insuranceschemes, State-specific regulations related to the qualityof care and Clinical Establishment Act 2011. Thesecriteria are listed as follows: /g122General criteria - For hospitals that provide non-specialised general medical and surgical care withor without ICU and emergency services. ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 114/g122Special Criteria (for clinical specialties) - For each specialty, a specific set of criteria has been identified. However, in order to offer a specialised clinical service, the hospital must have necessaryspecific infrastructure and HR in place as mentioned in the special criteria developed under AB-PMJAY for the same. As on 18 th November 2021, a total of 24,157 hospitals have been empanelled under AB-PMJAY . The various initiatives taken with regard to the creation of hospital network are as follows: /g122Empanelment of hospitals under Centralgovernment ministries: In order to ensure that beneficiaries are able to seek treatment closer to their homes NHA has empanelled all eligiblehospitals under Government of India with AB- PMJAY . These include hospitals from Ministry of Coal, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Power,Ministry of Railways among others. /g122Direct empanelment for private hospitals: Beneficiaries sometimes desire to get treated in States which are not implementing AB-PMJAY .For this purpose, NHA introduced the process of directly empanelling private healthcare organisations in such States. /g122Revision of empanelment under AB-PMJAY . Bearing in mind that dialysis is a procedure which needs to beperformed regularly for patients suffering from chronic renal disease, NHA has decided to empanel standalone dialysis centres for betterfacilitation of the necessary services to the AB- PMJAY beneficiaries. Quality Assurance One of the primary goals and a key focus area of the Scheme is to provide quality healthcare to itsbeneficiaries. To ensure that quality services aredelivered via EHCPs, NHA has developed thefollowing: /g122Monthly Quality Audit Checklist: This has been developed for Empanelled Health Care Providers for periodic assessment and monitoring of thequality of services provided. /g122AB-PMJAY Quality Certification: NHA has partnered with Quality Council of India (QCI) to develop a portal for online quality certification ofempanelled hospitals. These quality certifications include Bronze/Silver/Gold Quality certifications. /g122AB-PMJAY Quality dashboard: This was launched to aid States/UTs to monitor the progressof EHCPs who have applied for AB-PMJAY quality certification. As of 18.11.2021, a total of 239 empanelled hospitals have been certifiedunder these quality guidelines. Health Benefit Packages To ensure that the hospitals do not overcharge, and rates do not vary across hospitals, empanelled healthcare providers (EHCP) are paid based onspecified package rates. A package consists of all the costs associated with the treatment, including pre- and post-hospitalisation expenses. The specified surgicalpackages are paid as bundled care, where a single all- inclusive payment is payable to the EHCP by insurer/ SHA. To begin with, AB-PMJAY had 1393 treatment packages. These were reviewed and rationalised and HBP 2.0 came into existence with the approval of Governing Board of NHA. The HBP 2.0 has 874treatment packages containing 1,592 procedures, expanding access to various treatments and a scientific integration of implants and high-end consumables withinthe packages. HBP 2.0 has brought in multiple new concepts in the package design such as cross-specialty procedures, add-on procedures, stand-aloneprocedures, follow-up procedures, stratifications,ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 115 special conditions. HBP 2.1 led to enhancements with the inclusion of transplant packages. In November 2021, NHA launched HBP 2.2 with rate revision in 400+ packages to align them with stakeholders'expectations. Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs)A total of 625 Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs) have been developed by the team covering around 1592 AB-PMJAY procedures, and 599 of these STGshave been integrated into the AB-PMJAY Transaction Management System (TMS) to aid the Pre-authorising Panel Doctor (PPD) and Claims Panel Doctor (CPD)of third party administrators (TPAs), insurance companies, SHAs while processing a pre-authorisation or a claim by specifying the mandatory documentationrequired and specific information to look for in these documents for the prescribed procedure. This will help in preventing and controlling fraud and abuse too. Beneficiary Awareness and EmpowermentA detailed communication strategy has been developed by NHA, which is implemented at the national and regional levels. Various modes of communication such as leaflets, booklets, hoardings, TV , radio spots,interpersonal communication, etc., have been used as important elements for creating a comprehensivecommunication strategy for disseminating the desired messages across the target audience. Some of the key actions undertaken are listed below: /g190Celebration of Arogya Manthan Ayushman Bharat - Arogya Manthan organized around 23rd September of every year to celebratethe launch day of the AB-PMJAY scheme.

Out six diseases, three diseases namely Kala-azar, Lymphatic Filariasis and Malaria are targeted for elimination. The States/UTs are responsible for implementation of programme, whereas the Directorate of NVBDCP, Delhi provides technicalassistance, policies and assistance to the States/UTs in the form of cash & commodities, as per approved pattern. Malaria, Filaria, Japanese Encephalitis,Dengue and Chikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes whereas Kala-azar is transmitted by sand- flies. The transmission of vector borne diseases dependson prevalence of infective vectors and human-vector contact, which is further influenced by vector bionomics, ecological and social factors like climate,sleeping habits of human, type of vector, density and biting of vectors, migration of human population and development activities. Strategies for prevention and control of Vector Borne Diseases (VBDs) under NVBDCP are as follows: (i) Integrated Vector Management includes Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) in selected high risk areas, Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) in high malaria endemic areas, use of larvivorous fish, anti-larval measures in urbanareas including bio-larvicides and minor environmental engineering and source reduction for prevention of breeding. (ii)Disease Management involves early casedetection with active, passive and sentinelsurveillance followed by complete and effective treatment, strengthening of referral services, epidemic preparedness and rapid response. (iii)Supportive Interventions aim at Behaviour Change Communication (BCC), Inter- SectoralConvergence and Human Resource Development through capacity building. (iv) Vaccination only against Japanese Encephalitis.(v) Annual Mass Drugs Administration (MDA) against Lymphatic Filariasis. Malaria: Malaria is a potentially life threatening parasitic disease caused by parasites known as Plasmodium vivax(P .vivax), Plasmodium falciparum (P .falciparum), Plasmodium ovale (P .ovale) . It is transmitted by the infective bite of femaleAnopheles mosquito. Two types of parasites of human malaria, Plasmodium vivax and P.falciparum are commonly reported from India.P.falciparum is the cause for complications and leads to death, if not treated immediately. Epidemiological Situation /g122In 2020 total 186532 cases (119088 Pf cases) and 93 deaths were reported. /g122In 2021*(P) a total of 64520 cases of malaria and 35 deaths have been reported till July 2021 as compared to 89776 cases and 49 deaths reported during the same period in 2020amounting to 28.13% decline in malaria cases and 31.13% decrease in falciparum malaria.

Lymphatic Filariasis (LF), commonly known as elephantiasis is a disfiguring, disabling disease, usuallyacquired in childhood but generally there are nosymptoms. Infect a vast majority of individuals mayremain asymptomatic though all of them would havesubclinical lymphatic damage. Disease manifestationappears in a small proportion of infected individuals,commonly over 10 years of age. Lymphoedema orelephantiasis and hydrocele are the main clinicalsymptoms of chronic filariasis that disrupt the normaldaily activities to a large extent among the infectedpersons. Disease Burden: The disease has been endemic in 272 districts {15 districts (Odisha-7, Jharkhand-4, Telangana-4)included in 2020} across 20 States/UTs 1 (16 States &4 UTs). The estimated population at risk from thefilaria infection is about 670 million. State-wise Situation of ELF: A total of 6,43,933 Lymphatic Filariasis cases were reported from 16 States and 4 UTs, wherein,Lymphoedema and Hydrocele cases are 4,94,979 and1,48,954 respectively. A total of 10,201Hydroceletomy operations were performed in 2020across all endemic States/ UTs (Source: Data for LFfrom all states/ UTs updated annually at the end ofcalendar year). Strategy for Elimination of Lymphatic FilariasisIndia adopted the twin pillars strategy for elimination of LF as per recommendation of WHO. This strategyincludes: /g122Transmission control - Interruption of transmissionthrough annual Mass Drug Administration (MDA):To prevent the occurrence of new infection anddisease, annual single dose (Mass DrugAdministration - MDA) of i.e.,DEC + Albendazole (DA)/ + DEC +Albendazole (IDA), is administered to the entireeligible 2 population of the endemic districts. /g122Disability Prevention and Management -For thoseindividuals who already have the disease: Homebased of Dadar and Nagar Haveli and Damanand Diu UTs into 1 since January 2020. /g122Pregnant women, children below 2 years andcritically ill people are excluded Key events: Key achievements Status 2020 Stage in the program Total endemic districts in 2020 Total Lymphatic Filariasis 272 endemic districts Districts conducted MDA 97 in 2020 DA done 89 IDA done 8 Districts cleared 1st 98 Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS) and Stopped MDA Districts cleared 2nd 88 Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS) Districts cleared 3rd 42 Transmission AssessmentSurvey (TAS)ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 143 Dengue & Chikungunya a. DengueDengue is the fast spreading outbreak prone arbo- viral disease. Dengue Fever is transmitted by Aedesmosquito which is a day-biting mosquito and prefersto rest in hard to find dark areas inside the houses.Aedes aegypti is the principal vector; however, atpresent Ae. albopictus, has also been reported to playa role in Southern and NE States. There is no drugavailable to cure the dengue infection. Disease Burden Dengue is endemic to all States/UTs (except Lakshadweep and Ladakh). Recurring outbreaks ofDengue have during the period of July-November, there is an upsurge in the cases of Dengue in northern partsof the country. However, in the southern and westernparts of the country, the disease has become perennial.During 2020, a total of 44585 cases and 56 deathswere reported from 28 States and 7 UTs, whereas, in2021 (till 30th September), a total of 60112 casesand 30 deaths were reported from 26 States and 7UTs. Maximum cases were reported from from Maharashtra (14), Rajasthan(7), Uttar Pradesh (6) and one each from Gujarat andJharkhand. Case Fatality Rate (CFR, deaths per 100cases) which was 3.3% in1996 has come down to0.34 % in 2014, 0.22 % in 2015, 0.19 % 2016, 0.17%in 2017 & 2018, 0.11% in 2019, 0.14% in 2020 and0.1% in 2021 (till 30th September) because of bettermanagement of Dengue cases.

Chikungunya Chikungunya is a debilitating viral illness caused by Chikungunya virus. The disease re- emerged in thecountry after a gap of almost three decades. Thisdisease is also transmitted by Aedes mosquito, bothAe. aegypti and Ae. albopictus can transmit the disease.Symptoms of Chikungunya fever are most oftenclinically indistinguishable from those observed indengue fever. It is characterized by fever with severejoint pain (arthralgia) and rash. Joint pains sometimespersist for a long time even after the disease iscured.There is neither any vaccine nor drugs availableto cure the Chikungunya and the cases are managedsymptomatically.Disease Burden After re-emergence of Chikungunya in 2006, the cases of Clinically Suspected Chikungunya cases werereported every year but gradually declined till 2014.However, due to the report of increased numbers ofcases by few States, the disease showed an upwardtrend in 2015 (Karnataka) and 2016 (Delhi and nearbyStates).

Japanese Encephalitis Japanese Encephalitis (JE) is an outbreak prone arbo- viral disease transmitted by infected Culex vishnui group of mosquitoes which primarily breeds in ricefields mainly in rural areas. JE is reported under AcuteEncephalitis Syndrome (AES) which is characterizedby rapid onset of high grade fever, headache, neckstiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, and ultimatelydeath. The other causes of AES may be wide varietyof viruses, bacteria, protozoa, etc. Safe and effectivevaccines are available to prevent JE. Epidemiological Situation: JE is endemic to 336 districts of 24 States/UTs. During recent years thedisease is spreading to newer districts also. Around50-80% of disease burden is contributed by Tamil Nadu, Uttar disability are majorconcerns associated with JE.Achievements: JE Vaccination: Out of six vector borne diseases, JE is the only disease against which vaccination is available. This is mosteffective preventive tool available for JE. At presentStates are provided with live SA-14-14-2 JE vaccinefor Routine Immunization under Universal ImmunizationProgramme (UIP). It has now been decided that killedJE vaccine manufactured by Bharat Biotech Ltd.

The ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 148programme provides technical and financial assistance to states for all activities related to detection, diagnosis,treatment and post treatment care of persons affectedby leprosy. The Programme also aims at spreadingawareness about the disease, and at reducing stigmaattached with the disease. The major objective of the Programme is to detect the cases of leprosy at an early stage, and to providecomplete treatment, free of cost, in order to preventthe occurrence of Grade II Disability (G2D) in theaffected persons. Under NLEP, it is aimed to reduceGrade II disabilities to ZERO among new cases ofleprosy. Recent developments: /g122Introduced new Operational strategy for Active Case Detection and Regular Surveillance both inrural and urban areas in order to ensure detectionof leprosy cases on regular basis and at an earlystage in order to prevent grade II disabilities. /g122Further, with a view to scale up the screening,leprosy has been converged Besides,population based screening of women and menof age 30 years and above has been included inComprehensive Primary Health Care underAyushman Bharat at the Health and WellnessCentres. /g122With a view to encourage the States and theDistricts in their local endeavors to achieve thegoal of zero leprosy, Central Leprosy Division hasintroduced guidelines for certification and awardto the well performing Districts for achievingpotential leprosy elimination/ leprosy eliminationstatus. Achievements: India has achieved enormous success in leprosy control, particularly in the last four decades. Leprosyelimination, which means Prevalence Rate <1 case/10,000 population, was achieved at the National level in 2005. The MoHFW is constantly taking steps toachieve elimination of Leprosy at the sub-national level,i.e. upto the district level. A few major achievementsunder NLEP are as follows: 1. Prevalence rate has decreased to 0.41per 10,000 population in 2020-21. 2. Annual New Cases Detection Rate has declined to 4.58/100000 in 2020-21 3. Child cases percentage among new cases detected has reduced to 5.76 % in 2020-21. 4. Percentage of Grade 2 Disability among new cases detected has decreased to 2.48 % in 2020- 21. 5. The G2D amongst new cases per million population is decreased to 1.14 per millionpopulation in 2020-21. 6.

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic triggered lockdowns, restrictions in movement, repurposing ofavailable NTEP and health system resources,infrastructure, diagnostics, treatment centers andmanpower to fight this emerging threat, disruptingongoing TB elimination efforts and services all overthe country. NTEP's response plan and mitigationefforts included integrated TB-COVID bi-directionalscreening, diagnostic and treatment capacity upgrades,and co-located testing for TB (among COVID-19patient as well as ILI/SARI patients) and testing forCOVID-19 (among notified TB patients) apart froma plethora of periodically updated advisories, directives,and guidance documents issued to the States. Large scale active TB case finding campaigns were undertaken with massive screening and testing incommunities, health outreach workers and communityvolunteers were engaged to facilitate surveillance ofsymptoms within households, doorstep collection ofsamples and delivery of monthly medicine stock to helppatients stick to treatment regimens, and tele-consultations with patients. Private sector TB carefacilities were reopened, call centres were fullyactivated, digital tools were rolled out along withsupport like direct cash transfers and supplementaryfood provisions were delivered to people's home.Contact tracing systems and testing for TB linked toCOVID-19 contact tracing were also quickly set upthroughout the country. By December 2020, NTEP had managed notifying a total of 18,05,670 patients which was 11% more thanthe estimated projections made in April 2020 in viewof the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The privatesector too contributed notification of 5.49 lakh patients(31% of total notifications), 3% more than in 2019.Despite the pandemic, 95% of total patients notifiedwere put on treatment during 2020. During the year2021, a total of 15,79,410 (Jan-Sep) patients werenotified with 95% of patients put on treatment.Treatment Success Rate of TB notified patients remainsat 81% in 2021 despite the pandemic. Honourable Speaker of Lok Sabha Shri Om Birla delivering his address to Members of Parliament on Tuberculosis at the Parliament Annexe Over the past few years, the NTEP has seen asignificant increase in notification from the private sector.Patient Provider Support Agencies (PPSAs) throughdomestic budgetary resources were approved for atotal of 447 districts in 24 states. Through the availablemodalities, 484 NGOs and Private Providerengagements were made countrywide. The NTEP has also initiated Sub-National Certification of Districts/States/UTs for achieving \"Progresstowards TB Free Status\" under Bronze, Silver andGold categories measured with graded milestones ofdecline in TB incidence compared to 2015 levels.Districts/States/UTs are certified under the categoriesupon independent verification by a national teamcomprising of National Institute of Epidemiology,WHO India and Indian Association of Preventive andSocial Medicine. A total of 3 States/ UTs and another67 districts across the country laid claims under variouscategories. The UT of Lakshadweep and the district ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 152of Budgam in Jammu & Kashmir has been declared as the First TB Free UT and District in the country. Molecular diagnostic capacities were swiftly expanded and additional machines for rapid molecular testing forTB and Drug Resistant TB (DR-TB) had beendeployed in replace smear microscopy high-workload DMCs. A total of 3,164CBNAAT/ TrueNat machines are now available underNTEP with at least one rapid molecular diagnosticfacility available in each district. The Programme isworking diligently to further decentralize this capacitydown to block levels. ~ 17.00 lakhs molecular performed during the Jan- June 19,3130 first line LPA, 32,600 second lineLPA and 1,70,203 liquid culture tests performed. Dueto easy availability of molecular diagnostics, 88,446children were diagnosed with TB disease this year.The proportion of TB patients with known HIV statushas increased and 1.05 lakh PLHIV have been testedusing NAAT with 94% of notified TB patients havingbeen screened for HIV . In addition to the 87 Culture & DST laboratories certified by NTEP, 18 new laboratories are beingdeveloped with 28 laboratories being upgraded withLPA facility. Liquid culture-based DST has beenexpanded to Linezolid and Pyrazinamide across Indiaand DST capacities are being built for Bedaquiline,Delamanid, and Clofazimine at NRLs. Five Whole Genome Sequencing Platform and one Pyrosequencer has been deployed at national and statelevel TB laboratories to be initially used for sentinelsurveillance of drug resistance. Automated solutionsusing Artificial Intelligence for LPA result interpretationthrough Machine Learning (ML) are also beingdeveloped. 793 DR-TB centers were made functional to offer decentralized Drug Resistant TB (DR-TB) treatmentservices which include 173 Nodal DR-TB centers.This decentralization empowers districts to minimizethe gap between diagnosis and treatment, reduce costof travel and expedite early care of MDR/RR-TBpatients within their respective districts. The access ofinjection free longer oral MDR-TB regimen with newdrugs was expanded in all States/UTs in India. Duringthe -Sep) treatment. This included 10,105 M/XDR-TB patients put on longer oral MDR-TB regimenbetween January and September 2021. Under the TB-Diabetes collaborative 86% of the TDCs are now co-located diabetesscreening facility. 82% of all notified TB patients havebeen screened for diabetes in 2021 (Jan - Sep). The Government of India provides financial support to all TB patients for their nutrition needs under theNikshay Poshan Yojana (NPY) through direct benefittransfers (DBT) into the bank account of thebeneficiary since 2018. Oct 2021, the The NTEP is one ofthe first health programs in India to use DBT to transfermonetary benefits to eligible patients and providers atscale. NIKSHAY , the NTEP's online portal for patient-based TB notification and information management system,was completely integrated with the Public FinancialManagement System (PFMS) and is now updated withthe latest PFMS Bank Master on a real time basis. TillJuly 2021, about 616 districts have moved to DSCbased approvals in PFMS. Work is ongoing onintegrating Nikshay with SOCH (Strengthening OverallCare for HIV beneficiaries) and with the AyushmanBharat HWC-CPHC portals. TB preventive treatment has been prioritized under the pillar of \"Prevent\" in the National Strategic Plan toend TB in India by 2025. Scaling up TB preventivetreatment is of utmost importance to break the chainof transmission and breakdown of those with TBinfection into full-blown active TB disease. TBPreventive Treatment (TPT) was implemented inlimited population like children less than six years andpeople living with HIV with an increasing trend inANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 153 treatment coverage over the years. The NTEP has now expanded TPT to include children above five years,adolescents and adult household contacts of index TBpatients. This is being systematically expanded to coverall states by 2022. Between Jan - Sep 2021, preventivechemoprophylaxis was given to 47,695 child contactsof TB patients. A community-led response for TB has been incorporated as one of the key strategies to reach theun-reached and to support TB patients through theirtreatment and recovery phase. The National TB Forumand TB Forums in all States and Districts have beenconstituted with most of them convening their meetings.Given the restriction due to COVID-19, a 3-houronline module was also developed of the standardized3-day training curriculum for empowering TB TB survivors TB Champions using this module. To expand community-based services for prevention and management of TB and to bring services closer tothe community, TB has now been integrated with AB-HWCs. The NTEP completed training of ~ 3,326CHOs to provide TB services through HWCs. 829CHOs were trained on Active Case Finding. To address the social determinants of health beyond medical interventions, the NTEP has successfullyengaged with other Ministries, departments, PSUs,corporates, industries, professional associations,medical colleges and institutions, private healthcareproviders, development partners and the communityin critical areas of the TB care cascade like treatment,diagnostics, logistics and supply chains, Surveillanceand Monitoring, technology-driven interventions,operational research etc. Improved collaborationamongst different sectors, and establishment of aninter-ministerial coordination committee, are landmarkinitiatives undertaken by the Programme. Theseengagements are expected to increase the width anddepth of TB services through health facilities presentin other Ministries and reach more vulnerablepopulations. Hon'ble Union Ministers of Health and Family Welfare, discussing TB issues with State Health MinistersANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 154NTEP in partnership with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), launched a 3-year long pan-India 'TBFree Workplaces Campaign' to engage the businessleadership and provide a forum for convergence forthe industry's response to TB. NTEP also, along The Union, launched the \"CorporateTB Pledge\" (CTP) to provide the private sector anopportunity to join the fight against TB. Between bothcampaigns, NTEP has managed to reach out to over400 organizations with 130 of them signing the CTP. This year, despite the raging pandemic, NTEP launched the Mukt Bharat further buildawareness about TB, address the deep-seated stigmaaround the disease in the community, raise awarenessabout the available TB services under the Programme,and generate demand for TB services in the community.

Global IDD Prevention day was observed throughout the country on 21 st October,2021. IDD Messages were released on the Ministry ofHealth & Family Welfare's (GOI) Twitter handle. 5. For estimation of iodine content in salt, a total of 37,308 salt samples were collected and analyzedby States/UTs in FY 2020-21, out of which32,154 (86%) salt samples were found to beconforming to the standard (Iodine content > 15ppm). During FY 2021-22 (upto December,2021), 2,76,300 of which 203131 (73%) salt sampleswere up to the standard (Iodine content > 15ppm). 6. For estimation of Urinary Iodine Excretion (UIE), a total of 8895 urine samples States/UTs and of which1231(96%) samples having urinary iodine level >100g/L (optimal).ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 157 7. For ensuring the quality of iodized salt at consumption level, a total of 2,77,31,009 salt samples were tested by Salt Testing Kits (STK)by ASHAs in endemic Districts in FY 2020-21and presence of Iodine (adequate) was found in2,60,06,761 (94%). During FY2021-22 (upto December, 2021), 21,75,441 saltsamples were presence of iodine(adequate) was found in 20,14,431salt samples(92%). IEC Activities through the State HealthDirectorates State/UT Governments have also been provided grants for undertaking IEC activities at the local level in theirregional languages to make the impact of IEC activitiesmore effective including celebration of Global IDDPrevention Day in all Districts. Most of the States/UTshad conducted various IEC activities to observe GlobalIDD Prevention Day on 21 st October, 2021. 1.8 NATIONAL AIDS CONTROLORGANIZATION (NACO) NACO has implemented four phases of National AIDSControl including extendedphase IV (2017-21) Scheme. NACP responseto HIV/AIDS epidemic in India comprises acomprehensive strategy of Prevention, Testing,Treatment, Retention in care & Viral Suppression;supported through critical enablers of InformationEducation Communication (IEC), Laboratory Servicesand Strategic Information Management. Communitiesare at the centre of response, and equity, gender andrespect for the rights of communities were continuouslyadopted as guiding principles. Prevention: Targeted community led interventions for High Risk Groups (Female Sex Workers-FSW, Men who have Sex with Men-MSM, Transgender/Hijra-TG/H and Injecting Drug Users-IDU) and BridgePopulation (Migrants, Truckers) as well as inmates ofclosed settings like prisons, swadhar homes etc. isfundamental to AIDS response and aims to keep thesepopulation HIV free through awareness generation,safe behaviour promotion, Sexually TransmittedInfection (STI) management, condom promotion, harmreduction, HIV testing etc. IEC activities focus on awareness generation on prevention, testing & treatment and continue to be themainstay of NACP through a vibrant multi-mediaapproach comprising social media, mass media, mid-media, on-ground mobilization, interpersonalcommunications, advocacy and partnerships in thecountry. People who have STIs have higher risk of HIV infections and accordingly prevention and control ofSTI/Reproductive Tract Infection (RTI) is also amandate of NACP. These services are made availablethrough the Designated STI/RTI Clinic (DSRC),branded as Surakhsa Clinic across the country. Testing: NACP provides HIV testing services for early detection of HIV infections at more than 34,500 facilities. HIV testing is mandatorily accompanied bycounselling making it a unique feature of the programme.HIV screening has also been decentralized throughcommunity-based screening (CBS), so as to enhancethe uptake of these services by those at risk for HIV .Free counselling and testing of pregnant women is alsoprovided towards enabling early detection of HIVinfection during pregnancy; so as to prevent HIVtransmission to infants born to HIV positive pregnantwomen. Further Early Infant Diagnosis (EID)programmes provide the early diagnosis of HIVinfection among new-born babies of HIV InfectedPregnant women. Finally, it formulates the way toElimination of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV(EMTCT). Treatment: NACP provides free standardised Anti- Retroviral Therapy (ART) for all People living with HIV (PLHIV) as well as comprehensive managementof opportunistic infections. NACO has adopted the'Test and Treat' policy to enhance the uptake oftreatment services. Along with the first line; secondand third line ART regimens are also being providedANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 158for PLHIV who fail on the first and second line regimen. Single window delivery of TB and HIV services hasalso been initiated across all ART centers. Moleculardiagnosis/testing (e.g. Cartridge Based Nucleic AcidAmplification Test-CBNAAT) is being offered toPLHIV identified as presumptive tuberculosis (TB)cases for early diagnosis of TB in collaboration withNational Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP). Laboratory Services: The state of health of a PLHIV on treatment can be safely determined by measuring the number of copies of HIV virus in the blood. It alsoindicates his/her response to treatment. Since its launchon 26 th February 2018, the programme has progressively introduced routine viral load testing forall PLHIV , initially through a public private partnershipand thereafter, through 64 molecular laboratories setup by the Government in the public sector. Qualitytesting under NACP is ensured through a hierarchicalnetwork of laboratories for HIV diagnosis andmonitoring of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) countand viral load testing of PLHIV as well asdeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase chainreaction (PCR) testing for early infant diagnosis. Stigma and Discrimination: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Prevention and Control) Act,2017 towards protecting and securing the human rightsof persons who are infected or affected by HIV/AIDSor are vulnerable to the disease is underimplementation. The Act prohibits discrimination orunfair treatment of HIV-infected people on anygrounds. 1.8.1 Overview of HIV Epidemic in India 1.8.1.1 National Summary of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic 2020 Estimate (Lower Bound-Upper Bound) Adult (15-49 Yrs.) (15328-29075)ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 159 Nationally, as per India HIV Estimation 2020 report there were an estimated 23.19 lakh (18.33 lakh for 3.4% of the total PLHIV estimates. Thenational prevalence continued to decline from its peaklevel of 0.54% in 2000-2001 through 0.33% in 2010to 0.22% 2020. State/UTs wise estimated adultprevalence is given below. State/UTs wise estimated adult prevalence: India HIV Estimation 2020 There were 57.55 thousand (28.51 thousand - 113.70 thousand) new HIV infections in 2020, which hasdeclined by 48% since 2010 as baseline and by 89%since attaining the peak in 1997.The HIV incidencewas 0.04 (0.02-0.09) per 1,000 uninfected populationin 2020 which declined from 0.57 per 1,000uninfected population in 1997 through 0.09 -0.10 per1,000 HIV uninfected individuals in 2009-10 to 0.04per 1,000 HIV uninfected individuals in 2020. There were approximately 31.94 thousand (20.50 thousand - 52.01 thousand) AIDS-related deathsestimated in 2020 which has declined by 82.24 %since 2010. The estimated AIDS-related mortality per100,000 population was peaked at 24.34 per 100,000in 2005 and declined from 15.13 in 2010 to 2.37 in2020.HIV Prevalence (%) in different populationgroups in India 1.8.1.2 Route of transmission - HIV/AIDS is transmitted by sexual contact across mucosal surfaces, by maternal-infant exposure, and by percutaneousinoculation. In 2020, an estimated 57.55 thousandpeople became newly infected by HIV .

During the current Financial Year (2021-22), BE for National ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 160AIDS Control Organization (NACO) is Rs.2,900.00 crore, out of which an expenditure of Rs.1,445.75crore has been incurred upto 29 th December, 2021. 1.8.3 Targeted Community LEDInterventions Under the Targeted Intervention (TI) programme, thepreventive efforts are targeted primarily towards sub-groups of the population identified to be at high risk ofacquiring HIV infection. These include FSW, MSM,TG/H, IDU, inmates of prisons and other closedsettings and Bridge Populations such as Migrant andLong-Distance Truckers. These high-risk population groups are provided with several prevention services through 1461 Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)/ Community-Based Organization (CBO) led Targeted Interventions(TI), 137 Link Worker Scheme (LWS), 232 OpioidSubstitution Therapy (OST) full-fledged centres and1350 prison interventions at present. TI projects provide a package of prevention, support and linkage services to High-Risk Groups (HRGs)through drop-in-centre (DIC) and outreach-basedservice delivery model which includes : 1) Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) 2) Screening and treatment of STI and syphilis 3) Free condom and lubricant distribution4) Linkages to ICTC and CBS for HIV testing 5) Linkages with ART centres and care and support services for HIV positive HRGs, 6) Creating an enabling environment with community involvement and participation 7) Community mobilization, ownership building8) Specifically, for IDUs a) Free distribution of clean needles and syringes b) Abscess prevention and managementc) Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST) and d) Referral to detoxification/rehabilitation services.)The entire program is built on the peer-led approach in partnership with NGOs/CBOs. Individuals fromhigh-risk communities (peer educators) are engagedto deliver services and act as catalysts linking their peersto services and commodities. These peer educatorsidentify the HRGs and provide the services andinformation through various IPC sessions. TechnicalSupport Units (TSUs) have been directed to provideon-site assistance and handholding to revise theoutreach plan regularly to cover hard-to-reach andhidden populations. SACS and TSUs extendmentoring, hand-holding, and technical support to theTIs to ensure quality service delivery and enhance theoverall programme performance. Revamped and Revised Elements of Targeted Intervention for HIV Prevention and CareContinuum among Core Population To achieve the Global HIV target of 2030 to provide comprehensive prevention, testing, and treatmentpackages to vulnerable populations, the strategy of TIhas been revamped and a comprehensive TIRevamping Strategy Guide has been developed. Thekey program elements of the TI have been retainedand the newer activities incorporated into the ongoingTI program in the context of the specific keypopulations, bridge populations and special groups,to achieve more within the same inputs. The overarching principle for the revamped and revised targeted intervention strategy is the \"differentiatedapproach\" to prevention with the premise that 'onesize does not fit all', and re-categorises the keypopulation on individual risk and vulnerability indicatorsbased on evidence to optimise service delivery. Following are the new activities under Revamped TI approach: 1) Strengthened Outreach Activity 2) Community Based Screening and Bio-Medical Waste Management 3) Peer Navigation 4) Index TestingANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 161 5) Mapping and Population Size Estimation 6) Secondary Distribution of Needle and Syringes 7) Satellite Opioid Substitution Therapy Centers and 8) Community Scorecard Progress on Quarterly Score Card for TIs The table below shows the progress made in two quarters from January to June 2021. The percentageof TIs scoring \"very good\" has decreased from 67 %during the period of Jan to March 21 to just 13 %.This is observed to be due to COVID-19 pandemicand it is expected to improve as the restrictions aretaken off by the Government. Summary of Scorecard for the period of January to June 2021 Quarter Poor A verage Good Very Good Jan to March 4% on the evidence of risk and vulnerability, morethan 85 % of the core group HRGs have been coveredthrough TIs with primary prevention services such astreatment for STI, condoms, needles/ syringes, BCC,enabling environment with community engagement andlinkages with care and support services during thisreporting period. Considering the period of association of HRGs in the TI, the population is segregated into active anddynamic. The Dynamic population/ HRG refers to theHRGs who are aware of their risk and vulnerabilitybecause of their long-term association or exposure withthe TIs. Therefore, the new population identified withinthe same geography would replace this dynamicpopulation in the TIs, while TIs would continue to offertheir routine services. In the reporting period, the coverage of TI for HRGs among FSW, MSM, IDU and TG/H was 95%, 80%,91% and 83% respectively. The coverage and numberof TI for the calender year are presented in the tablebelow.

From initial 56 centres in FY 2007-8 covering around 5,500 IDUs, the OST program hasbeen scaled up to 232 standalone centres coveringabout 39,888 active clients in 2021. There are two models of OST service delivery in India namely the NGO Model and the Collaborative Model.In the collaborative model, the OST services aredelivered at the Government Health Facilities incoordination with the link IDU-TIs. Additionally,satellite OST centres have been rolled out with a total of 110 Satellite centres currently functional across 7States under NACO as part of the TI revampedstrategies. NACO has also conducted a Training ofTrainers (TOT) on OST to create a national cadre ofMaster Trainers in September 2021. The list of MasterTrainers include faculty from the Psychiatry departmentsof premier institutes such as AIIMS, NIMHANS aswell as senior medical officers from the OST program. Link Worker Scheme (LWS) - Reaching-out to Rural Populations NACO has been implementing Link Worker Scheme (LWS) since 2006 to address HIV infection in the ruralsector. The scheme was then scaled up with GFATMround 7 funding and today the scheme is beingimplemented under the overall National AIDS ControlProgramme. In this FY 2021-22, 162 numbers of LWSwere approved in AAP. As of September 2021, 137Link Workers Scheme is implemented in 143 districtsin 16 states. The objectives of the LWS are: 1. Reach out to HRGs and vulnerable men and women in rural areas with information, knowledge, skills on STI/HIV prevention and risk reduction.This entails: 2. Increasing the availability and use of condomsANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 166among HRGs and other vulnerable men and women. 3. Establishing referral and follow up linkages for various services including treatment for STIs,testing and treatment for TB, ICTC/PPTCTservices, HIV care and support services includingART. 4. Creating an enabling environment for PLHA and their families, reducing stigma and discriminationagainst them through interactions with existingcommunity structures/ groups, e.g. Village HealthCommittees (VHC), Self Help Groups (SHG)and Panchayat Raj Institutes (PRI). As of September 2021, LWS is coveringapproximately 1500 vulnerable villages in 143 districtsacross 16 states under scheme, MSMs, 456 TGs were addition to this, the schemealso covered nearly 2.10 lakh migrants, 48,628truckers and 3.34 lakh other vulnerable populations.The programme also reached out to 25,788 PLHIV;65,181 ANC and around 9,135 TB cases. Around2.57 Lakh population were tested for HIV , and 7,939cases have sought treatment for STI. Number of Population Covered under LWS from the period January to September 2021 Population Line Led Model (ELM) The Employer Led Model (ELM) has been designed to provide HIV/AIDS prevention to care services toinformal labourers including migrants and truckers, whoare linked to the industries directly or indirectly, themajor objectives of ELM model are: /g122Increase awareness and access to HIV and AIDSprevention to care services for the informalworkers /g122To create an enabling environment by reducingstigma and discrimination against PLHIV /g122To encourage and help prospective employers tointegrate and sustain the HIV and AIDSintervention Programme within existing systemsand structures. Under this model, efforts were undertaken to involvemajor industries and associations to integratecomprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention to careprogramme within their existing structure. State-wisemapping was conducted by SACS/TSU to find outthe prospective employers and MOUs were signedby the SACS with the respective employers. SACS/TSU have adequately built the capacity of theemployers and supported them in conducting differentactivities for the informal labourers. The ELM is envisaged as a win-win situation for both employers as well as for the National Program. Anemployer does add value by addressing the HIV/AIDSrisk and vulnerability of their own workers as well asworkers in the supply chain. This not only fulfils thecommitments under MDG but also makes theirleadership keen about the National priorities. With the support of and concerted efforts by SACS and TSU toward the end of September 2021, NACOhas been able to partner approx. 766 industries across22 States, covering 5.1 lakh workers/ migrants forvarious HIV AIDS related services.ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 167 TB-HIV case linkage activities in Targeted Intervention Programme Early identification of presumptive tuberculosis (TB) cases through screening among the High-Riskpopulation would be an important complementarystrategy to meet the national urgency in acceleratingcase detection to achieve the goals of the 'End TB'strategy. Active Case Finding activities have yieldedadditional cases in different vulnerable groups in Indiathus the High-Risk Groups (HRGs) are also includedin this, and steps were taken to include the populationinto the screening. The yield of cases depends on thescreening high-risk groups and bridge population. The TB screening has been initiated by TI and Link worker Scheme working under NACP with robustguidelines. TB services are provided as referral services to most vulnerable populations which include Female SexWorkers (FSWs), Men who have Sex with Men(MSM), Transgender/Hijra (TG/H), Injecting DrugUsers (IDUs) and Bridge Populations such as migrantsand truckers. During routine outreach services, the peereducator (PE) and other outreach team membersscreen HRGs and bridge populations for TB symptomsand refer them to the nearest TB centre for confirmationand treatment. To promote intensified TB case findingat TIs, increase awareness and reduce stigma for bothTB and HIV , four different models are proposed,based on the location and facilities available at TI level. It is expected that all HRGs are screened four times in a quarter and the bridge population is screened whilevisiting the clinic. From January to September 2021 atotal of 19.17 Lakh core HRGs and 6.7 were screened for TB. The yield rate wasfound 2.0 % among HRG and 4.6 % among bridgepopulations. The details are mentioned in the belowtable.TB Screening and Treatment Cascade (Januaryto September 2021) TB Screening & Population Treatment Core Bridge T otal a.

Technical Support Units (TSUs): State Technical Support Units (TSU) were set up during the NACP-III in 2007 with assistance of donorpartners. TSU is setup in States to complement andenhance the effectiveness of SACS with focus on HIVprevention, testing and treatment program underNACP and complement the programme with evidence.Currently 17 TSUs (10 TSUs as per the new structureand 7 TSUs as per the old structure) are supporting24 SACS which are managed by different agencies.This is besides the eight North Eastern States beingcatered by North East TSU. The National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS and STI 2017 - 24, expanded the terms of reference of TSUto cover all technical areas of the programme underNational AIDS Control Program (NACP) in StateAIDS Control Societies (SACS). The scope of TSUwork has been expanded to provide technical inputbeyond the prevention activities and 10 TSUs withexpanded mandate were procured by NACO inSeptember 2018. District AIDS Prevention and Control Units (DAPCU) Using the HIV Sentinel Surveillance data (2004-2006), all the districts in the country were divided into fourcategories (Category A, B, C and D) based on thedisease burden. As per this, there were 156 CategoryA and 39 Category B districts (total 195 districts)across the country that required priority attention.NACO as part of major structural reform, establishedDAPCUs in 188 such districts to provide programmaticoversight through decentralized facilitation, monitoringand coordination of HIV/AIDS programme activitiesin the district. This pandemic witnessed migration and reverse migration of informal labours/ workers on a large scale.This opportunity was utilised to reach out to them,wherever possible to conduct ICTC and STI camps. DAPCUs also contributed significantly to the distribution of PPE Kits and dry ration to the sexworkers enrolled under NACP, as per the guidancegiven by NACO based on the directions of Hon'bleSupreme Court. Timely coordination with the local foodand civil supplies and other line departments ensuredaccomplishing the task. Condom ProgrammeDistribution of Free Condoms to the High Risk Group population has been the mainstay of preventionprogrammes under the NAACP. In this FY 2021-22,efforts have been made to distribute free condomsthrough HIV facilities also, apart from the TargetedIntervention project settings. The budget allocation of46 Crores have been made to meet the demand offree condoms for HRGs at HIV facilities like ICTC,DSRC and ART Centres. 1.8.4 Information, Education &Communication (IEC), Youth &Mainstreaming Information, Education & Communication, Youth &Mainstreaming are important components of theNACP. With the expansion of services for counselling,HIV testing, Anti Retroviral Treatment, SexuallyTransmitted Infection Treatment and condompromotion, the demand generation campaigns willcontinue to be the focus for the NACP communicationstrategy.ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 169 Observance of World AIDS Day The World AIDS Day, 2021 with the theme 'End Inequalities. End AIDS. 'End Pandemics' was observed by the National AIDS Control Organizationon 1st December, 2021. The observance was done ina hybrid mode where both physical and virtualparticipations were made by the participants. Dr.Bharati Pravin Pawar, Minister of State, Health &Family Welfare chaired the event and also interactedwith the students from across the country and discussedwith them the activities undertaken through Red RibbonClubs in their respective institutions and areas. Shereiterated that youth 'bhagidari' is instrumental inspreading awareness about HIV-AIDS Dr. Bharati Pravin Pawar, Minister of State, Health & Family Welfare chaired the event World' s AIDS Day on 1st December, 2021 Mass Media Campaigns: NACO as well as SACS has undertaken 360-degree multimedia campaigns on various thematic areas relatedto HIV i.e. Youth & HIV , Promotion of HIVcounselling and testing, Condom Promotion,Elimination of Mother to Child Transmission, Stigma& Discrimination, Sexually Transmitted infection &promotion of V oluntary Blood Donation onDoordarshan, Cable and Satellite channels, All IndiaRadio (AIR), and FM radio networks. To amplify thereach of mass media campaigns, innovativetechnologies were also utilized like dissemination ofadvertisements through internet.Outdoor Activity: Outdoor activities like hoardings, bus panels, pole kiosks, information panels, and panels in railways andmetro trains were implemented by the State AIDSControl Societies to disseminate information on HIVprevention and linking them to HIV related services.Wall writings have been emphasized in many States tomaximize the reach of HIV awareness to ruralpopulation. The National Toll Free Helpline no. 1097has also been promoted in all the outdoor activities. Social Media: Digital interventions in present times are the cheapest mean of communication and certainly most powerfulto increase the reach to masses. To optimally utilize this opportunity, NACO is presently active on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram & Youtube as@NACOINDIA. Through all its Social MediaPlatforms, NACO has tried to develop, upload andshare content around different themes such as safebehaviour, condom usage, stigma and discrimination,myths and misconceptions about HIV and AIDS,important health days observed around the globe, anddays of other national and international significance. The idea behind exploring these digital platforms has been to bring upfront the issues related to well beingof people living with HIV and to eliminate the stigmataand discrimination attitude against people living withand affected by HIV . Glimpses of Social Media Campaign carried out by NACO to celebrate Phase I of NewIndia@75 underthe aegis of 3,39,206 calls from January 2021 to September 2021. High call volume isrecorded in the months of March, April, and May 2021during the second wave of COVID-19 in India. Duringthis time the helpline service played a crucial role inlinking the clients to the services, social protectionschemes and also provided psychosocial counsellingfor distress callers. Till 30 th September 2021, the Helpline has recorded a total of 3.8 million calls on the server since inception in 2014. Capacity Building for Helpline Counselors: NACO ensures that the counsellors placed at the helpline hubs are trained on a regular basis as per theprogramme need. A capacity building session was held on 6 th August 2021 through virtual mode, wherein, the counsellorsof the helpline were trained on the HIV & AIDS (Prevention & Control) Act 2017. The backgroundof the Act, provisions and section-wise details weredisseminated to the counsellors. The names andcontact details of Ombudsman currently designated in17 states has been provided to the counsellors forsharing with the callers on helpline who raise issuespertaining to stigma and discrimination. Youth Interventions Adolescence Education Programme (AEP) is a key intervention to build life skills of young people and helpadolescents to cope with negative peer pressure anddevelop positive behaviour cultivating awareness onsexual health and preventing HIV infections.Programme is implemented in collaboration withNCERT and Education Department. 16-hour curriculum is taught in the schools to adolescent students of class VIII, IX and XI. Currently, theprogramme is functional in more than 50,000 schoolsin the country. Due to the COVID situation, onlinetraining of nodal teachers has been conducted. Red Ribbon Club (RRC) Currently there are 12,546 Red Ribbon clubs constituted/functional in colleges under the programme.

Thisyear, SACS have started organising district level andstate level quiz competitions. It is planned to organiseNational level quiz competition on the occasion ofNational Youth Day, once regional competitions aresuccessfully completed. Out of school youth (OSY) intervention aims to sensitize school dropouts who are not covered underAEP. This year, SACS has conducted most of thetraining through virtual mode in coordination withNehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan and a few NGOs identified by SACS. The program is functional in 21states i.e. India@75 initiative is to commemorate India's 75th Independence Day as a mega massmobilization and engagement movement. For the same,NACO has been entrusted with the task of organisingthree major awareness campaigns on HIV/AIDS,Tuberculosis and V oluntary Blood Donation. To alignwith the 75 th year of Independence, it was envisioned to fruitfully engage 75 schools and 75 Red RibbonClubs (RRCs) in phased manner throughout the yearto spread awareness about HIV , TB and V oluntaryBlood Donation Day. Launch of Phase I In this line, the 1 st phase of the campaign was launched on 12th August 2021 on International Youth Day by Hon'ble Union Minister of Health & Family Welfare. The event was virtually joined by more than 1,23,000students from different schools and colleges across thecountry. After the launch event, students from 25schools and 25 colleges from each state participatedin awareness activities on HIV & AIDS, Tuberculosisand V oluntary Blood Donation for two months. Virtual Engagements in the launch of Phase I of Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav Mainstreaming and Partnership NACO signed 18 Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with key Ministries/ Department ofGovernment of India aiming for a multi-sectoralresponse to accelerate efforts toward ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Mainstreaming & partnership effortshave impacted positively in vulnerability reductionthrough inclusion in programme & policy, awarenessgeneration through training and sensitization, expansionof HIV related services in existing health services ofnon-health Ministries and of the Public SectorUndertakings. ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 172Joint Working Group meeting between NACO & Ministry of Road Transport & Highways A Joint Working Group meeting was held between NACO and Ministry of Road Transport & Highways(MoRT&H) under the Chairmanship of DeputyDirector General (IEC & MS), NACO on 2 nd February 2021 with the objectives to strengthen partnershipbetween NACO and MoRT&H and evolve workablestrategies for prevention and extending services relatedto HIV/AIDS primarily among truckers, transport andhighway workers and associated populations. National Level Orientation of Ombudsman Taking cognizance of the urgent need of the State AIDS Control Societies, NACO conducted the first NationalLevel Orientation on Roles and Functioning ofOmbudsman under the Chairpersonship of AS&DG,NACO on 9th July, 2021. A total of and Nicobar Islands joined the orientation.The objective of the orientation was to acquaint theOmbudsmen with the duty imposed on them under theHIV and AIDS (P&C) Act, 2017; for them to have aclear understanding on the legal rights of PLHIV andidentify any violation which is prohibited under the Act. The HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) Act, 2017 provides for the appointment of Ombudsmanby respective State Governments to inquire into theviolations of the provisions of the Act (Section 3 andproviding healthcare services). Sections 23, 24, 25,26, 27, 28 under Chapter X and Section 38 of theHIV and AIDS Act, 2017 deal with the authority ofthe Ombudsman, detailing the powers of theOmbudsman, the procedure of complaint and theorders of the Ombudsman. National Level Multi-Stakeholder Consultation on Finalization of HIV and AIDS Policy forEstablishments: NACO organized a National Level Multi-StakeholderConsultation on Finalization of HIV and AIDS Policy for Establishments under the chairpersonship ofAS&DG, NACO on August 26, 2021. 1.8.5 Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI)and Reproductive Tract Infection (RTI)Control & Prevention Currently, there are 1,167 NACO supported DSRCacross the country (at least one DSRC per district).There are two arms of DSRC are a) Obstetrics & Gynaecology OPD andb) STI OPD under dermato-venereology clinics and provide services through existing public health care delivery system.

The pre-packaging of thedrugs is being recognized as one of the globalinnovations in STI programme management. The drugsused to treat common STI/RTI are included in theNational/State List of Essential Drugs. STI/RTI colour-coded Kits Regional STI/RTI Training, Research andReference Laboratories There are 10 functional Regional STI Training, Reference and Research Laboratories supported &strengthened by NACO. These are located at 1) Osmania Medical College Hyderabad, 2) Medical College Kolkata and Institute of Serology Kolkata, 3) Government Medical College Nagpur, 4) Government Medical College Baroda, 5) Institute of Venereology, Chennai,6) Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, 7) BYL Nair Hospital, Topiwala National Medical College, Mumbai8) Government Medical College, Guwahati, Assam, 9) Post Graduate Institution of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh 10) Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi which acts as the Apex Centre as well as Regional Laboratory for the country. The key functions of these laboratories are to provideetiologic diagnosis of common STI/RTI syndromes,validation of syndromic diagnosis, monitoring of drugsensitivity of gonococci and implementation of SyphilisExternal Quality Assessment Service (EQAS). The provision of a standardized package of STI/RTI services to HRG population is an important componentof the TI projects 1.8.6 HIV Counseling and Testing Services (HCTS), Including HIV TB PPTCT The HCTS include components: and Testing Services of GeneralIndividuals, Prevention of Parent-To-ChildTransmission of HIV (PPTCT) & Early InfantDiagnosis of HIV Exposed babies. /g122Community Based Screening (CBS) /g122HIV/TB collaborative activities HIV Counselling and Testing Service Centre(HCTS) As on September 2021, there are 34,500 HCTS facilities established in all over India. Some PPPHCTSc levied charge for HIV Testing due to usage oftheir own test kits HIV Counselling and Testing Services of General Individuals During 2021 (till September), around 104 lakh general individuals have been tested for HIV , out of which55,524 were diagnosed HIV Positive. ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 174Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission of HIV (PPTCT) and Achieving Elimination of Mother to ChildTransmission of HIV (EMTCT) The transmission of HIV from HIV Positive Mother to their children is during pregnancy, labour, delivery,or breastfeeding. For addressing this issue in India,the PPTCT programme was started in the country inthe year 2002 with the aim of offering HIV testing toevery pregnant woman (universal coverage) in thecountry. As on September, 2021 this service is offeredthrough more than 34,500 HCTS centres in entirecountry. The aim of the HCTS centres, which offersPPTCT services, is to identify all estimated HIVpositive pregnant women and eliminate transmissionof HIV from mother-to-child. NACO is implementingEID service through 5,235 SA-ICTCs. During 2021 till September, about 124 lakh of pregnant women were tested for HIV , and 3,548 new cases(includes 219 PNC mothers) were diagnosed and3,490 known cases were reported (Source MPRCST) out of total (7,038) HIV pregnant womenreported, 91% (6,439), were initiated lifelong ART.During the same period, around 7,669 HIV exposedlive births were reported, out of which 6,524 (85%)babies received ARV prophylaxis. Early Infant Diagnosis (EID)A child may acquire HIV from the HIV infected mother-in-utero (during pregnancy), peri-partum(during delivery), post-partum (through breastfeeding)or via parenteral exposure through infected needlesand syringes. In children who acquire HIV in-uteroand peri-partum, disease progression occurs rapidlyin the first few months of life, often leading to death.Studies suggest that in the absence of diagnostics, careand treatment, about 35% of HIV-infected childrendie in the first year of life, 50% by their second birthday,and 60% by their third birthday. The HIV exposed infants born to infected pregnant women have to undergo TNA-PCR tests using DriedBlood Spot (DBS) test. During 2021 Apr-Sept.4,185babies were undergone TNA PCR test with 6 weeksto 6 month under first visit and out of which 30 wereconfirmed HIV positive Further, during the same period4,617 HIV exposed babies who attained 18 monthsof age were undergone antibody test, out of which149 babies were confirmed HIV Positive and 131 wereput on ART. Achieving Elimination of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV (EMTCT): - It is estimated 20,517 (2019 estimates) women living with HIVbecome pregnant in the country. If those wereuntreated, there have 15-45% chance of transmittingthe virus to their children during pregnancy, labour,delivery or breastfeeding. However, the risk drops tojust over 1% if ARV medicines are given to bothmothers and children at the stages when chances oftransmission can occur. As treatment for prevention ofmother-to-child-transmission is not 100% effective,elimination of transmission is defined as a reduction oftransmission to such a low level that it no longerconstitutes a public health problem. 1.8.6.2 Community Based Screening approach: CBS is an important approach for improving early diagnosis, reaching first-time testers and people whoseldom use clinical services, including men andadolescents in high-prevalence settings and HRGpopulations. To improve HCTS access and coverage,community-based HIV screening is carried out throughvarious approaches such as: - Mobile HCTS; Screening by ancillary health-care providers (ANC); Screening for HIV by TI (TI-ICTC); HCTS for prison inmates and HCTS at theworkplace. Currently the bulk of CBS efforts are through targeting HRGs via TIs and Other Development Partners andCSO. /g122Standard Operating Procedures for CBS andtraining manual \"Testing through TI\" forCommunity Based HIV testing under NationalHIV Counselling & Testing Services Guidelines,2016 has been shared with all the States. /g122As on September 2021, in India 2,861 CBS siteswere established under different settings asANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 175 mentioned above and reporting to NACP through SIMS. As per the current SIMS Report, 34 states areimplementing CBS and provided HIV testing/screeningservices to 2,402,274 individuals including pregnantwomen from Apr 21-Sept 21). HIV/TB Collaborative Activities Tuberculosis (TB) and HIV are major public health problems globally and particularly so in India. Thesetwo diseases are leading causes of morbidity andmortality among all infectious diseases. In 2019, Indiaaccounted for estimated 71,000 (49,000-98,000)incident HIVTB co-infectedpatients (63,000-1,26,000) in 2018 (WHO's GlobalTB report 2020). The Launch of Phase 2 Awareness Campaigns on HIV & TB by Hon'ble MoS, Dr. Bharati Pravin Pawar on 12.10.2021Achievements: a. For early detection of HIV among presumptive TB patients, Provider Initiated Testing and Counselling (PITC) is Nearly 64% of Designated Microscopy Centres (DMCs) are co-located/located in proximity toHIV testing facilities. c. Out of total Number of PLHIV reported in the period of Jan-June, 73,977 were accessed rapidmolecular testing via NAAT for TB diagnosis. d. No of TB patients who know their HIV status-1,484,418/1,579,971 (94%) (Jan-Sept2021) e. Single window TB and HIV services are being implemented through existing 645 ART centersand these services are being further scaled up.With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Multi-Month Dispensation (MMD) of medicines, teleconsultations and newer ways of service deliveryare being considered. f. The services include counselling of PLHIV , Opportunistic Infection (OI) management andART/CPT provision, TB screening among ARTcenter attendee using 4 symptoms tool. Based onTB status, PLHIV are being offered TB treatmentor TB preventive therapy after careful evaluationby ART medical officer. g. More than 95% of PLHIV visiting the ART centres every month are screened about anyexisting TB symptoms. h. The linkage of HIV-TB co-infected Preventive Therapy Therapy & 93%respectively (Jan to REPORT 2021-22 176i. More than 13 lakh PLHIVs initiated on TB Preventive Therapy since Dec'16. j. To further expand the service delivery, central government has issued Gazette Notification by GoIdated June 27, 2019 about mandatory requirement ofART centers and Drug Resistant TB services in allmedical colleges. The following are the key interventions being undertaken to strengthen HIV-TB Collaborativeactivities: I. Intensified TB Case Finding (ICF) /g122ICF at Under ICF, all ICTC clients are screened by ICTC counsellors for presence of TB symptoms at the time of pre and post-testcounselling. Clients who have symptoms or signsof TB, irrespective of their HIV status, arereferred to NTEP facility located innearest/co-located institution. During FY 734,462 (7%) of general clients(except pregnant women) receiving have been referred for TBtesting from ICTC, and 37,517 were detected asTB cases, 5% of out of those referred. /g122ICF at ART Center: PLHIV diagnosed with Tuberculosis are linked to first line anti TB drugsdaily regimen for TB patients diagnosed in therespective ART centers while those with need forsecond line drugs are linked to nearest DrugResistant TB screened for ICF for 4 symptomsat ART centres and subsequently 5.1% and 2,575 with TB.(Source: MPR-Sep.2021).II. Use of diagnostic (CBNAAT orTrueNAAT) for early diagnosis of TB andRifampicin drug People livingwith HIV(PLHIV): Nucleic Acid Test (NAAT) in the CBNAAT or TrueNAAT is preferred, and sensitiverapid TB diagnostic tool recommended for TBdiagnosis in PLHIV and is available in all districts ofthe country. TrueNAAT is a new diagnostic tool recently added for providing TB and DRTB detection at block levelapart from existing network of 1285 CBNAATlaboratories in the country. The scale up of thisdiagnostic modality will further help in early diagnosisof TB and Rif Resistance among People living withHIV . Quality Improvement activities for Basic Services under NACP I. Supervision and Monitoring Mechanism: Regular Supportive Supervisory visit conducted by NACO Official to NACP facilities to reviewon ground implementation of the NACP services.The monitoring and supervision visits are alignedto cover testing services, PPTCT services, HIV-TB coordination activity and STI RTI servicesprovided under NACP. Supervision andmonitoring of HCTS activities is done at Nationaland State level with the help of SIMS, PALS andIMS/SOCH softwares. II. Quality assurance and EQAS: The diagnostic services provided through ICTCs across thecountry are strictly monitored by a strong Internaland External Quality Assurance Scheme (EQAS). III.Supply Chain Management: A robust inventorymanagement system with a strong supervision ofsupply chain activities at National and State levelis in place for ensuring timely supply of thediagnostic kits with proper maintenance of coldANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 177 chain for HIV Testing Kits for HCTS facilities and colour coded kits for STI management at DSRCs.The inventory status for all commodities at theState, District and Facility level is monitored onmonthly basis at the National level. IV . Review meetings: As part of program, the BSD, NACO has been conducting review meetings onBSD components at regular intervals both atNational and State level on virtual platform, whichincludes, review meeting for SACS (ICTC/PPTCT) and STI components, National TB HIVJoint review meetings, National TB HIVCoordination committee (NTCC) and, NationalTB HIV Technical Working Group (NTWG)meetings. The main purpose of the meeting isevaluating the performance of the States/UTsunder NACP. Operational correction of linkage loss from F-ICTC to SA-ICTC: To increase the access of at- risk populations to HCTS in a cost-effective manner,NACO in addition to establishing SA-ICTC at theCHC and higher levels, has evolved a strategy withthe RCH programme for integrating HIV screening atall primary health centres (PHCs) and delivery pointsacross India. They are labelled as Facility IntegratedCounselling and Testing Centres (F-ICTCs) linked tothe nearest SA-ICTC (confirmatory facility). HIVscreening at all is implemented through theirexisting staff with due sensitization, orientation,guidance, monitoring and supervision by the linked SA-ICTC. This mechanism of taking HCTS closer to the people has increased the uptake of services while reducingtransportation costs and waiting times. Further,integrating HCTS into the general health system willensure sustainability, cost-effectiveness and facilitatethe mainstreaming of HCTS. This will also ensureachievement of the objectives of eliminatingHIV and syphilis among newborns.BSD, NACO organised an assessment with thesupport of partner organizations (SAATHII & PLAN)to investigate the reasons and suggest correctivemeasures to fill the gaps in confirmation of screenedreactive pregnant women for programmaticimprovements. Based on the recommendations from the findings from Root cause analysis of linkage loss analysis done in 12identified States, Standard Operative Procedures forcorrection of linkage loss are being drafted and will bedisseminated to the States. 1.8.7 Care, Support and Treatment The Care, Support and Treatment (CST) componentof the NACP aims to improve the survival and qualityof life of People Living with HIV with universal accessto comprehensive, equitable and stigma free HIV care. CST services include free and universal access to lifelong standardized Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART),free diagnostic and monitoring services (baselinelaboratory investigations, CD4 testing, viral load testing,etc.), facilitating long term retention in care, prevention,diagnosis and management of opportunistic infections,linkage to care and support services and linkage tosocial protection schemes. Facilities for ART Service Delivery : Care, Support and Treatment services are provided through a spectrum of service delivery facilities includingStand Alone ART Centres (SA-ARTCs), Centres ofExcellence (CoEs), Paediatric Centres of Excellence(pCoEs), Facility Integrated ART Centres (FI-ARTCs), Link ART Centers (LACs), Link ART-PlusCentres (LAC Plus) and Care & Support Centres(CSCs). There are active linkages and referralmechanisms between these centres to providedecentralised treatment and specialized care for thePLHIV .ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 178Types of Facilities for ART Service Delivery (as on September, 2021) ART Centres 645 CoE 11 (includes CoE, pCoE, pCoE 07 ART plus, FI-ARTc, ART Plus 93 & PPP ARTc) PPP 12 Link ART Center (includes LAC-Plus centres) 1,261 Care & Support Center 310 Beneficiaries of ART services Beneficiaries (Government Sector) Cumulative No. (as on September, 2021) PLHIV on ART 14,06,055 PLHIV on Second Line ARV drugs 101069 PLHIV on Third Line ARV drugs 4,528 Achievements: Scale up of facilities and services (FY 2005 - 2021 & to September 2021) Improvement in ART retention cascade: 'ART retention cascade' refers to the sequential steps ofpatients from diagnosis of HIV to linkage with ARTcare, ART initiation and retention of patients who areon ART. After introduction of the 'Test & Treat Policy'in 2017, overall ART retention across the country hasimproved significantly through intensified outreachactivities (Mission Sampark & Intensified MissionSampark) and through interventions likeimplementation of Differentiated Service DeliveryModels, quarterly feedback to States and ART centresbased on 'Score-card' analysis of identified indicators,etc. NACO is closely monitoring the ART retentioncascade as a quality indicator of State and facility levelperformance. Over the previous three years theprogramme had seen noteworthy improvement intreatment retention. But due second wave of pandemicin the starting months of year 2021 and the subsequentlock downs, it has affected the testing services and allthe subsequent indicators of the care cascade of theprogramme. The unlocking of the States for regularactivity which started in July showed improvement inthe indicators. The number of PLHIV alive on-ARThas been also risen and has shown positive trend incomparison to the last year. The three major stages in ART retention cascade are as follows: /g122Linkage of Diagnosis to ART Registration atTreatment site /g122Treatment Initiation /g122Retention 1. HIV Diagnosis to ART Registration linkage:Those diagnosed positive at ICTC have to be linkedto ART centres for treatment and care. The programmehas been making efforts to minimise this linkage lossand has shown positive trends over years. ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 179 Linkage of Diagnosis to Registration at Treatment site 2. ART Initiation Rate: The programme has achieved remarkable improvement in the ART initiation rate, from 61% in 2013-14 to 94% 2020-21. From January toSeptember 2021, the ART initiation rate is 92% Trend of ART Initiation 3. Twelve-months retention: The data received from ART centres shows that the 12-month retention was72% in the year 2017-18 and improved to 75% in2018-19 but has gradually decreased since then. The12-month retention of the PLHIV was impacted dueto the COVID-19 pandemic and at the end of theMarch 2021 it has been recorded as 71%. Differentiated CareThe ART centre infrastructure under NACP has expanded from 8 ART centres in 2004 to 645 ARTcentres till September 2021. Currently, the nationalHIV program provides free first line, second line andthird line ARVs to approximately 14.06 lakh PLHIV .The implementation of \"Test and Treat\" policy since2017, has resulted in expanded access to life savingART but resulted in the following challenges:/g122Overcrowding at the ART Centers /g122Ensuring 12-month retention levels /g122Enhancing adherence amongst On-ART patients These challenges were overcome through adoption ofa 'Client centric' 'Differentiated Care' approach toservice provision at the ART centres. Monitoring and Feedback Mechanism Along with quantitative scale up under the programme, NACO has been working consistently towardsmaintaining the quality of services provided under theprogramme. The Score Card is being used to providefeedback every quarter. The performance of ARTcentres is reviewed at regular intervals. Score Card: The tool is developed with an intention to provide performance status of each ART centre on pre-decided critical indicators in an individual state ata single glance to the programme managers at SACS.The performance under the indicators are denoted bycolour coding wherein green colour denotes goodperformance, yellow as in average and red denotesthe performance deficit. These Scorecards are beingsent quarterly to all the SACS/ART centres. Number of ARTCs in different colour zones based on their performance Review of Special-25 ART Centres : This year total 50 ART centers across the country catering to high/ medium load of PLHIVs on ART were identified tobe having poor performance consistently. Thesecenters will be provided special monitoring andtechnical support by two of the technical partnersjointly with senior NACO officials. 25 ART centersby each of the two implementation partners will be ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 180providing the special support. The programme is to prepare ART center wise action plans and monitor eachcenter for next 6 months for its improvement on thecritical indicators of the programme i.e adherence toART, reduction in loss to follow up and deaths ofPLHIV on-ART. The activity went on pause for sometime in starting of the year and restarted in August 2021. Key Achievements in this year: Transition of PLHIV to DTG based regimen: NACO introduced Dolutegravir based ARV regimenin India under the NACP in 2020. In keeping with therecommendations of WHO and the ART TRG (Adults& Adolescents), Dolutegravir based ARV regimenswere started to be prescribed for PLHIV in Indiafrom the month of April 2020 and currently more than9.78 lakh patients have been transitioned to DTGregimen which is approx. 70% of the total PLHIV onART under the programme. Rapid Initiation Algorithm : With the adoption of 'Test & Treat' policy, all People Living with HIV (PLHIV) are eligible for ART initiation, irrespective oftheir CD4 counts or WHO staging. Under the currentsystem a PLHIV is required to make multiple visits toART centers before ART initiation, particularly for labinvestigations. Considering the issue, a special algorithmwas released for all ART centers to be followed forART initiation among PLHIV . The Algorithmconsidered that same day/rapid initiation of ART isfacilitated, wherever possible. This initiative will help to avoid unnecessary delay in ART initiation and inconvenience to PLHIV leading tosome patients becoming LFU even before the initiationof ART. Other Activities: 1. 16 th Meeting of Technical Resource Group, ART (Adult & Adolescents: ART TRG meeting for Adult and Adolescents was held through virtual platform on 16th October 2021, to review ART strategies and ARV regimens for people living with HIV . 2. 13th Meeting of Technical Resource Group,ART (Paediatrics ): ART TRG meeting for paediatrics was held through virtual platform on 1st October 2021, to review ART strategies and ARV regimens for children living with HIV . 3. ARV Forecasting and Quantification Working Group Meeting: ARV drug forecasting and quantification meeting for adult and paediatric regimenswas held through virtual platform in the months ofFebruary and December 2021 to discussmethodologies and assumptions related to ARV drugforecasting and to calculate drug requirements underNACP. The meeting was attended by working groupcommittee members, NACO officials andrepresentatives of development partners. 4. Constitution of National Technical working group for engagement of private sectorengagement under NACP: Two meetings of the group have been conducted in the months of July andOctober 2021 and the group has identified the fieldsfor collaboration with the private sectors, which willcontribute towards achievement of countries goal ofending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. 5. Annual Review Meeting of Care Support and Treatment Services under NACP : The meeting was held in hybrid mode at Vishakhapatnam under thechairmanship of AS & DG, NACO. The meeting through virtualmode. 6.National operational guidelines for ART services 2021 and National Technical Guideline on Anti Retroviral Treatment 2021 were released on 1stDecember 2021. 7. Other initiatives: I. Verbal Autopsy to assess cause-specific mortality rate among PLHIVs. Understanding the causes of death among the PLHIV could providenewer insights and help to generate evidences anddirections for future interventions and strategies.ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 181 NACO conducted an exercise of verbal autopsy to ascertain the cause of death among a sample of thedeceased PLHIV registered in the ART Centers. Underthe activity National Consultation and capacity buildingworkshop were done for the ART staff consisting ofSMO/ Medical Officers, Counsellors, RegionalCoordinator and TSU from the North & North-Eastregion along with the CST NACO Officials. A total of more than 1000 verbal autopsies have been conducted. The activity had to be stopped due to therestrictions imposed by the COVID-19 scenario dueto which the reported preparation got delayed and isnow under process for release. II. Self-Verified Adherence (SV A): Adherence to treatment is the most important factor which determines the treatment outcome. Based on the program data, ithas been observed that maximum loss to follow upand poor pill pick up is observed in the first 6-12months. Hence, there was a felt need to have moreintensive tools for adherence monitoring to trigger earlysupport during these crucial time period. NACO implemented second phase of SV A in year 2021. In this phase programme expanded the SV Apilot to 30 more facilities including 20 from last year,making total pilot sites to 50 across country. Theprogramme also utilized its help line number 1097 byintegrating it with SV A platform in this phase. The SV Aintervention utilizes the following strategy: /g122Augmented pill box packaging: One Toll Free number will be pasted on the existing medicinebottles. The patients call on the Toll free numberat the time they take the medicine and getsrecorded at the dashboard. The calls made areused for adherence monitoring. /g122For patients who are not calling on toll freenumber, SMS or IVR reminders are sent topatients to remind them to take medications, Acall from the helpline number is initiated to remindpatients about aadherence. In case the client doesnot call even after a reminder, the outreach workerpays the client a visit for intervention.With this intervention, the program plans to build thehabit formation of the client on drug consumptionbehaviour and avoid missing doses through reminderSMS. This will further lead to real time monitoring ofthe adherence of the patient thus, enabling early supportaction when the patient misses a dose. III. Gazette of India notification regarding establishing ART Centers in Medical Colleges:Gazette of India has published a notification on 25 June2019 regarding establishing ART Centers in allgovernment and private Medical Colleges; theAmendment Notification in \"Minimum StandardRequirement MBBS Admissions Annually Regulation,1999\" following addition has been done in ClauseA.1.24 as \"Every Medical College should have ARTCentre and facility for management of MDR-TB atthe time of 4th renewal for admissions of 5th Batch ofMBBS students\". In reference to this, NACO is pursuing all Medical Colleges (Government and Non-Government) toestablish ART Centres and as of September 2021, 67 ART centers have been established in the Medicalcolleges across India. 1.8.8 Laboratory Services Under NACP, routine access to quality assured HIVrelated laboratory services is made universallyavailable. The testing laboratories are assessed for theirperformance under the External Quality Assurance(EQA). Apart from EQA Laboratory Services oversees 1) Early Infant Diagnosis by HIV-1 TNA PCR on DriedBlood Spot (DBS) samples 2) CD4 testing throughflow-cytometry and 3) routine viral load testing tomonitor the efficacy of the treatment in PLHIV and itsquality assurance Viral Load (VL) Testing:Viral Load test in the national programme is useful for early and accurate detection of treatment failure. Thetest is used for the following purposes:ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 182/g122Prognosis : predicts disease progression in the body. High HIV-1 viral load indicates a fast progression of the disease in body and vice versa /g122Prevention : predicts the risk of transmission of virus from person to person. High HIV-1 viralload indicates a high risk of transmission and viceversa /g122Therapy management: demonstrates theeffectiveness of ART for a person. It varies frompatient to patient. A high HIV-1 viral load mightindicate a need to switch the regimen Additionally, it helps in quantification of Third 95 goalstowards achieving suppressed viral load in 95% ofPLHIV initiated on Anti- Retroviral Treatment. NACO has scaled up routine viral load testing through a two-pronged approach: /g122Public Private Partnership : From January 2021 to November 2021, a total of 8,08,187 viral loadtests have been done with a viral suppression of83%. /g122Scale-up of Public Sector VL laboratories:From January 2021 to November 2021,2,42,766 tests have been done with a viralsuppression of 88%. HIV-1 Viral Load EQA: Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National AIDS Research Institute (NARI), Pune hasbeen identified as an Apex laboratory for executingthe countrywide Viral load (VL) Proficiency testing(PT) programme. Proficiency testing is an essentialcomponent in a comprehensive laboratory qualityassurance program. In the FY' 2020-2021 two PT rounds (R) were conducted. In Round 1, 41 VL labs participated. Outof these 41 labs, 31 labs scored acceptable results. In Round 2, 52 VL labs participated. Out of these 52 laboratories, 38 labs scored acceptable results.Graph depicts that the average participation andperformance of VL laboratories in both the roundsconducted in FY' 2020-2021 Early Infant diagnosis (EID): HIV-1 PCR laboratories for children under 18 Months HIV exposed infants can't be tested using standard HIV antibody tests due to the presence of maternalantibodies (transferred during pregnancy or breastfeeding) and absence of self-generated antibodies earlyin life (antibodies typically develop around 4-9months). For detection of HIV-1 infection in infants and children below 18 months of age, it is recommended that HIV-1 virological assay should be used for testing at 6 weeksof age or thereafter. Nucleic acid detection gives directevidence of presence of infection. The current test of choice is the HIV-1 TNA (Total Nucleic Acid) PCR from Dried Blood Spot samples(DBS) which detects HIV pro-viral DNA & RNA andis done at six EID reference labs in the country. FromJanuary 2021 to November 2021 a total of 14,074tests were conducted 3 CD4 TestingCD4 cells are a type of lymphocyte also known as T helper cells which get activated and generate aneffective immunological response to the invadingpathogen. CD4 cells have specific receptors on theircell membrane which are the primary target of HumanImmunodeficiency Virus (HIV). HIV infection resultsin a decline in CD4+ T cell numbers and thus, loss ofcell-mediated immunity leading to increasedsusceptibility to opportunistic infections. ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 183 At present, there are total 478 CD4 testing machines under NACP which are installed at 465 CD4 testingcentres. Timing of CD4 testing: CD4 testing is done at the time of first visit of PLHIV to the ART centre. CD4testing is not a mandatory test for ART initiation but isused for monitoring of immunological response inPLHIV (for this purpose it is done at baseline andthereafter every 6 months), management of OI(opportunistic infections and Immunological failure) andadditionally as per clinical condition and at thediscretion of treating physician. To strengthen the implementation of Quality Management System, all Lab Technicians of CD4 labsundergo annual training conducted by NACO andSACS. A total of 12,49,306 tests were performed from January 2021 to November 2021. Total CD4 tests done from January 2021 to November 2021 External Quality Assurance (EQA) for HIV and CD4: Laboratory quality can be defined as accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of the reported test results.Laboratories produce test results that are widely usedin clinical and public health settings, and healthoutcomes depend on the accuracy of the testing andreporting. If inaccurate results are provided, theconsequences can be very adverse: 1) incorrect treatment; treatment complications 2) failure to provide the proper treatment3) delay in correct diagnosis4) additional and unnecessary diagnostic testing.Quality is an integral part of Lab Services Division and emphasis on quality assured laboratory service deliveryis important to the success of the NACP. Universalavailability and routine access to quality assured HIVrelated laboratory services is ensured at all servicedelivery points through Lab Services division. Theassurance of quality in HIV testing services andmolecular testing is ensured through the implementationof External Quality Assessment (EQA). The EQAensures high reliability and quality under theprogramme. The laboratories are categorized into four tiers, as follows: /g122Apex Laboratory (first tier) - National level: 13 (NRLs) (second NRLs In-country EQA for HIV and Viral Load Testing laboratories under NACP isdepicted in the picture given below: Panel Testing : Well Characterized coded panels are sent biannually from Apex to NRL (8-member panel) SRL to SA-ICTC(4-member panel). The average participation of NRLsin panel testing was 100% with no discordanceobserved Out of 130 referral laboratories (13 NRLs and 117 SRLs), 93 laboratories (13 NRLs and 80 SRLs) have ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 184been accredited by National Accreditation Board for Testing and calibrating Laboratories (NABL) as perISO 15189: 2012 standards. NACO has extended QMS implementation among the viral load testing laboratories. The standard checklistfor the assessment of QMS implementation has beendeveloped.

The evidence-based decision making is ensured through complementary systems of IT enabled client centric programme monitoring, epidemic monitoringand research focusing on high quality data collection, analysis and dissemination. India's successful response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic has been strongly guided by a robust strategicinformation (SI) management system. Programme Monitoring and Evaluation is vital to evidence-based National AIDS response. As country moved towards attaining of 2030 SDG of ending AIDSas a public health threat, it is crucial to assess the progress towards stated targets and goals for evidence driven decision making. For programme Monitoring and evaluation, there are various information management systems being implemented under NACP. Among all, Strategic Information Management System is backbone of theprogramme monitoring. The SIMS is hosted on the NIC MeghRaj Cloud of Govt. of India. Every Month more than 35000 NACP facilities submits consolidatedreports. These facilities Standalone Centres, 29,091 - Facility Integrated Counselling &Testing Centres and 645 Anti-Retroviral Treatment Centres. The reporting is 80% or more across the key components.

PROGRAMME FORPREVENTION MANAGEMENT OFTRAUMA AND BURN INJURIES(NPPMTBI) A. Trauma Care component: 1. Background and Introduction: 1.1 Worldwide, accidental trauma is a major yet unrecognized public health problem. India ranks 1st in the number of road accident deaths across the 199countries reported in the World Road Statistics, 2018followed by China and US. As per the WHO GlobalReport on Road Safety 2018, India accounts foralmost 11% of the accident related deaths in the World.Road traffic injuries are one of the leading causes ofmortality in people aged 5-29 years. It is the 8th leadingcause of death for all age groups surpassing HIV/AIDS,tuberculosis and diarrheal diseases. 1.2 In India, road traffic crashes are one of the major causes of disability, morbidity and mortality. As perthe Road Accident Report for 2019, a total number of4,49,002 accidents took place in the country duringthe calendar year 2019 leading to 1,51,113 deathsand 4,51,361 injuries. In percentage terms, the numberof accidents decreased by 3.86 % in 2019 over thatof the previous year, while the accident related deathsdecreased by 0.20 % and the persons injureddecreased by 3.86. The decline in road accidents andinjury reported during the calendar year 2019 appearto have been a result of the Motor Vehicle Actimplemented in States from September 1st 2019 whichfocused on road safety and included, inter-alia, stiffhike in penalties for traffic violations as well aselectronic enforcement.1.3 The programme for trauma care started during9 thand 10th Five Year Plans as \"Pilot Project for Strengthening Emergency Facilities along theHighways\". During the 11 thFYP, the programme was approved as \"Assistance for Capacity Building forDeveloping Trauma Care Facilities in GovernmentHospitals on National Highways\" for developing anetwork of trauma care facilities (TCFs) inthe Government Hospitals along the GoldenQuadrilateral highway corridor as well as North-South& East-West Corridors wherein 116 TCFs wereapproved in 17 States on these corridors on 100%Central assistance. 1.4 The scheme was further extended during 12 th FYP as \"Capacity Building for Developing Trauma Care Facilities in Govt. Hospitals on National Highways \"wherein 80 Hospitals/Medical Colleges wereapproved for financial assistance in addition to otherinterventions. The scheme is being extended since thenand presently approval on Cabinet Committee ofEconomic Affairs (CCEA) from 1.4.2021 to31.3.2026 is under submission for continuing supportto already approved TCFs as per the new norms of theprogramme approved under the \"National TertiaryHealth Care Programmes\" and undertaking parallelactivities for capacity building of human resourceinvolved in providing critical care, developing a databasefor injuries/accidents/burden of Emergency care atpublic health facilities, developing standard guidelines,performance indicators for trauma care facilities andcontinue working towards awareness generation etc. 2. Objectives of the programme are as follows: /g122To establish a network of Trauma Care Facilities on National/State Highways in order to reducethe incidence of preventable deaths and disabilitiesdue to road traffic accidents by observing goldenhour principle. /g122To develop Surveillance, Trauma Registry andCapacity Building Centre for collection,compilation, analysis and dissemination ofinformation for policy formulation and preventiveinterventions.ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 215 /g122To improve the awareness about trauma care among the general masses and vulnerable groupsby developing and disseminating IEC material. Key Highlights and Achievements (upto31.12.2021) are: 1. Financial support to the tune of Rs. 269 lakhs has been utilized including release to the State of Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat,Arunachal Pradesh and Dadra and Nagar Havelion reimbursement basis and as first instalmentrespectively. 2. In order to review the progress of programme implementation, Review Meetings via video-conferencing were held with 5 StateGovernments. 3. Out of 196 Hospitals/Medical Colleges supported for setting up of Trauma Care Facilities so far,126TCFs have become functional and areproviding services to trauma victims. 4. Draft EFC document for continuation of the programme has been developed keeping in viewthe recommendations/observations of Evaluationreport by NITI Aayog for centrally sponsoredschemes, wherein strategies have been suggestedto improve the outcome of the programme. 5. IEC material developed (Audio-visuals) on prevention and first aid in drowning. Review-cum-Orientation Workshop on Tertiary Care Programmes in November, 2021 B. Burn Injuries component: 1.1 Globally, burns are a serious public health problem. An estimated 265 000 deaths occur eachyear from fires alone, with more deaths from scalds,electrical burns, and other forms of burns, for whichglobal data are not available. Over 96% of fatal fire-related burns occur in low- and middle-incomecountries. 1.2 India has one of the largest burdens of burns with an estimated 7,000,000 burn injuries per year,and an estimated 1.4 lakh deaths and 2.4 lakhdisabilities, making burn injuries the second largestgroup of injuries after road accidents. (National HealthPortal, India ). These figures translate to a mortality rate of over 8.3/100,000 population, disfigurement andpermanent disability in 250,000 people annually, anda loss of 5 million disability-adjusted life years(DALYs). 1.3 This high incidence has been attributed to illiteracy, poverty, and low safety consciousness in thepopulation. The epidemiology of mortality after burnsis unique in India; most burn injuries are in young adultsand deaths are more common in women than men,contrasting trends observed in other low- and middle-income countries. Burns survivors are also known toANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 216be financially distressed, vocationally challenged and socially excluded. Death and disability due to burn injuryare preventable to a great extent provided timely andappropriate treatment is provided by trained healthcareprofessionals. 1.4 Keeping in view the magnitude of the problem, a pilot programme on burn care was initiated in theyear 2010 by Ministry of Health & Family Welfare inthe name of \"Pilot Programme for Prevention of BurnInjuries\" (PPPBI). This was initiated in three MedicalColleges and six Districts Hospitals. The goal of PPPBIwas to ensure prevention of Burn Injuries, providetimely and adequate treatment in case of burn injuries,so as to reduce mortality, complications and ensuingdisabilities and to provide effective rehabilitativeinterventions if disability has set in. 1.5 The pilot project continued as full-fledged programme for tertiary care level during the 12 th Five Year Plan period. The financial assistance towardsDistrict Hospital component was undertaken underNational Health Mission (NHM). The scheme is beingextended since then and presently approval on CabinetCommittee of Economic Affairs (CCEA) from1.4.2021 to 31.3.2026 is under submission forcontinuing support to already approved Burn Units asper the new norms of the programme approved underthe \" National Tertiary Health Care programmes\" alongwith other activities of the progarmme. 2. The objectives of the programme are as under: /g122To establish a network of burn units with adequateinfrastructural facility for burn management andrehabilitation in all identified Govt. MedicalColleges and District Hospitals. /g122To improve the awareness among the generalmasses and vulnerable groups especially thewomen, children, industrial and hazardousoccupational workers. /g122To establish Burn data registry under NPPMBI /g122To carry out Research for assessing behavioural,social and other determinants of Burn Injuries inthe country to facilitate effective need basedprogram planning, monitoring and evaluation. /g122To organize burn Injury training Programmes fordoctors, nurses and paramedical staff associatedin management of burn injuries from the identifiedDistrict Hospitals and Govt. Medical Colleges. Highlights and Achievements (upto 31.12.2021)are: 1. As informed in review meetings, out of 50 Burn Units, Burn Units in 9 Medical Colleges have become functional and construction is in progressin 20 medical Colleges. 2. Draft EFC of the Continuation of the scheme as a separate programme has been prepared in viewof the data/recommendations received from thesituational analysis report, NITI Aayog ofan evaluation study conducted through E&Y LLCfor all CSSs and suggestions given by thestakeholders. 3. Project on \"Situational Analysis of Burn Injuries in India\" undertaken by the Programme Divisionin collaboration with AIIMS, New Delhi has beenfinalized and report has been submitted. 4. Standard Treatment Guidelines for management of Burn Injuries has been developed. 5. Continuous Review Meetings are being held with State Governments via video-conferencing toreview the progress of implementation of BurnProgramme . ORGAN TRANSPLANTPROGRAMME (NOTP) TRANSPLAN-TATION OF HUMAN ORGANS ANDTISSUES ACT 1994 Transplantation of Human Organs and TissuesAct, 1994 To regulate the removal, storage and transplantationANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 217 of human organs for therapeutic purposes and for the prevention of commercial dealings in human organ thegovernment of India enacted the Transplantation ofHuman Organs Act (THOA), 1994. The said Act isapplicable in all States and UTs except State of AndhraPradesh and Telangana which both have their ownActs. The Act was amended in 2011. The amended Act is named Transplantation of Human Organs and TissuesAct (THOTA), 1994.The amended Act is National Organ Transplant Programme (NOTP): A huge gap exists between patients who require organ transplants and organ donors. Therefore, there is aneed to promote deceased organ donation. Afternatural cardiac death, only a few tissues can be donated(like cornea, bone, skin) whereas after brain stemdeath, a person can donate many vital organs likekidney, liver, heart, lungs, intestine and pancreas andtissues like corneas, skin, bones and heart valves etc.One organ donor can save up to 8 lives and improvethe quality of life of many others. Brain Stem death is recognized as a legal death in India under the Transplantation of Human Organs and TissuesAct, since 1994 like many other countries, which hasrevolutionized the concept of organ donation afterdeath. Government of India is implementing NOTP for promotion of organ donation from deceased personsso as to increase the availability of organs fortransplant in order to improve access to organtransplant in the country. An apex level organization,National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization(NOTTO) has been established at SafdarjungHospital Campus, New Delhi for setting a countrywide networking of Transplant and Retrieval Hospitalsand Tissue Banks and maintaining National Registryof Transplant cases, Organ Donors etc. NOTTO hasa dedicated website www .notto.gov .in for providing information on organ donation and transplantation andonline facility for registration of hospitals fornetworking and creation of National registry. So far,516 hospitals performing organ/tissue transplantationhave been registered with the NOTTO website andallocated a unique ID. Online and offline pledgingfacility for organ and tissue donation has been madefunctional. A 24x7 days Helpline is operational withtoll free No. 1800114770. The organ allocationpolicies, Standard Operative guidelines are availableon the NOTTO website https://notto.gov .in/ guidelines.htm.This networking is important forsuccessful procurement and distribution of organs ina transparent manner. Five Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organizations (ROTTOs) have been established forleading the States in their respective regions. TheseROTTOs have been set up in medical institutions thatare champion institutions in the field of Organ DonationTransplantation at Chennai, Mumbai, Guwahati,Kolkata and Chandigarh. Likewise, State level organizations are also being set up with one planned for each state. So far 15 StateOrgan and Tissue Transplant Organizations (SOTTOs)have been sanctioned by Govt. of India Pradesh and most recently Puducherry.

In 2013, the NRHMwas subsumed under the National Health Mission(NHM) as its Sub-Mission, along with National UrbanHealth Mission (NUHM) as the other Sub-Mission. In terms of infrastructure development, thrust has been given to reduce the gap in availability of facilities,particularly in Tribal areas. Overall, there has been 73%increase in health facilities available in Tribal areascompared to 10% increase for all, between 2005 and2020: Relaxed Norms for Tribal areas Under NHM, tribal areas enjoy relaxed norms underseveral criteria and conditions. Type of All India T % CHCs 61 % 643 10 % 20,200 34,983 73% RHS-Rural Health Statistics (* As on 31st March, 2005 and **As on 31st March, 2020) 1) Relaxed norms for health facilities -The population norms for setting up health facilities intribal areas are relaxed. Against the populationnorms of 5000, 30000, and 1,20,000 for settingup of Sub-Centres, PHCs and CHCsrespectively, in tribal and desert areas it is 3000,20,000 and 80,000 for SCs, PHCs and CHCsrespectively. A new norm of \"time to care\" hasalso been adopted for setting up Sub-HealthCentres in tribal areas under which a Sub HealthCentre can be set up within 30 minutes of walkfrom habitation.2) Flexibility with the assigning of ASHSs- States have been provided with the flexibility of relaxingthe norm of one ASHA per 1000 population toone ASHA per habitation in tribal/hilly and difficultareas. 3) Medical Mobile Units (MMUs)- While other States had Mobile Medical Units per 10.00 lakhpopulation subject to capping of 5 MMUs perdistrict, for tribal and hilly states this could berelaxed as per need. The norms for MMU havebeen further revised to relax the norm where extraANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 397 MMU is allowed if the existing MMU exceeds 60 patients per day in plain areas and 30 patientsper day in tribal/hilly areas. 4) High Priority Districts- All tribal majority districts whose composite health index is belowthe State average, have been identified as HighPriority Districts (HPDs). These districts are toreceive higher per capita funding, relaxed norms,enhanced monitoring and focused supportivesupervision and encouraged to adopt innovativeapproaches to address their peculiar healthchallenges. Launch of Tribal Health Collaborative 7.4.2021 8.3 NATIONAL URBAN HEALTHMISSION (NUHM) NUHM was approved on 1st May, 2013, as a sub-mission under an overarching NHM. NUHM envisagesstrengthening the primary health care delivery systemsin urban areas and for providing equitable and qualityprimary health care services to the urban populationwith special focus on slum dwellers and vulnerablepopulation. NUHM covers all cities and towns with more than 50,000 population and district headquarters and Stateheadquarters with more than 30,000 population. Theremaining cities/ towns continue to be covered underNRHM.As part of Ayushman Bharat, the existing U-PHCs arebeing strengthened as Health & Wellness Centres(HWCs) to provide preventive, promotive and curativeservices in cities closer to the communities. Sofar 4203HWCs have been operationalized in urban areas ason 29.11.2021. Since the beginning of the Programme in F.Y . 2013- 14, support has been provided for strengthening ofmore than 5500 facilities in urban areas, constructionof about 890 new UPHCs and 90 new UCHCs havebeen approved. The human resources under theprogramme include Medical Officers,530 Specialists, 19500 ANMs, 10800 Staff Nurses,4100 Pharmacists, 4200 Lab Technicians and 750Public Health Managers have been approved. About81000 ASHAs and 98000 MAS have been approvedfor effective community participation activities. Training& capacity building activities have also been approvedfor building and strengthening institutional capacity.Theservices being provided through these facilities areavailable to all sections of the population including SC& ST. 8.4 NATIONAL TUBERCULOSISELIMINATION PROGRAMME (NTEP)FOCUS ON TRIBAL AREAS Tuberculosis has been a priority public health issueidentified to be addressed by the Government of India.The National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme(NTEP) is implemented under the aegis of the NHMand provides free diagnosis, free treatment and deliverspublic health functions to reduce the incidence ofTuberculosis (TB) in the country. Government of Indiahas committed to achieve targets for TB under theSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2025, fiveyears ahead of the global timelines. As a part of its efforts at multi-sectoral engagements, the NTEP has signed a MoU with the Ministry of TribalAffairs (MoTA) in May 2021 with an aim to makepeople TB free in Tribal districts and geographies. Ajoint action plan was developed and released by bothMinistries as a part of the TB Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan.While the overall goal of the tribal TB initiative is to ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 398reduce TB cases and death due to TB in the tribal populations, community empowerment andmobilization, expanding services to detect, treat andprevent TB, and strengthening health systems andcapacities are areas which the collaboration will lookto augment. Launch of TB Initiative Tribal Health Collaborative (THC) on 26.3.2021 To execute the joint plan, NTEP has put forwardoperational activities to be carried out in the next 12months in all identified tribal districts in collaborationwith MoTA. The activities will be reviewed periodicallyfor course corrections and more activities will be addedsubsequently in consultation with MoTA. During thisphase, out of the 176 tribal districts identified by MoTA,'priority districts' have been selected based on highTB burden. Implementing partners working in theseidentified districts will also be supporting NTEP inimplementing the activities.Under NTEP, the benefits of the programme areavailable to all sections of the society on a uniformbasis, irrespective of caste, gender, religion etc.However, in tribal, hilly and difficult areas, specialprovisions have been made to expand diagnostics andtreatment centres, programme management units, toimprove access to TB patients and coverage of TBservices under NTEP. Under the special project entitled \"Targeted Intervention to Expand and Strengthen TB Control inTribal Populations under NTEP\" to reach out to thetribal population was initiated with the support of GlobalFund in coordination with ICMR. The most significantaspect of the project is to deployment of Mobile TBDiagnostic Vans (MTDV) equipped with X-rayfacilities and CBNAAT machines contributedsignificantly to the total case notification. Mostimportantly, the Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (OOPE)of the patients reduced drastically which is highlysignificant and reflects that offering services at thedoorstep of the patients does improve the Standardof Care to the patients. The reduction in man days forseeking consultative, diagnostic and treatment serviceswhen being serviced by the MTDV also reflects onthe improved standards of care through doorstepservices. At present, a total of 80 MTDV diagnosticvans are functional across the country to cover hardto reach population including tribal area. 8.5 NATIONAL LEPROSYERADICATION PROGRAMME (NLEP) National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP),India is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme under theumbrella of National Health Mission (NHM). Themajor concern of the Programme is to detect the casesof leprosy at an early stage, and to provide completetreatment, free of cost, in order to prevent theoccurrence of Grade II Disability (G2D) in the affectedpersons. Under NLEP, it is aimed to reduce G2D permillion population to less than 1 per million populationand to have zero G2D among new child cases alignedwith the target given by Global Leprosy Strategy2016-20. ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 399 Key Initiatives Several initiatives have been taken to encourage early case detection, to ensure complete treatment, and tocontain the onset of disease in close contacts of theindex cases (persons diagnosed with leprosy). Briefly,the activities for early case detection are as follows: For enhanced active & early case detection, so that there remain no cases of leprosy and eventuallyconverted into Grade II Disability a. Introduction of new Operational Guidelines 2020 \"Active case Detection & Regular Surveillance\" under NLEP, to ensure active case detectionthroughout the year. b. Further strengthen the active screening for early case detection, on a more regular basis,convergence of leprosy screening has been doneand the detailed screening guidelines have beenissued to all the States/ UTs. c. Convergence of leprosy screening under Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC),Ayushman Bharat for population based screeningof women and men of age 30 years and above. d. Urban Leprosy Screening under NUHM for peri- urban and urban slums area/ colonies' migratorypopulation. Stop Discrimination against People Sufferingfrom Leprosy Sparsh Leprosy Awareness Campaigns (SLAC) were launched at village level to create more awareness sothat the level of stigma and discrimination can bereduced in the case of diseases like Leprosy. Post Exposure Chemoprophylaxis Administration For prevention of leprosy amongst contacts, the administering PEC has been strongly recommended.In addition, various services are being provided underthe programme for Disability Prevention and MedicalRehabilitation (DPMR) i.e., reaction management,provision of MCR footwear, Aids & Appliances,referral services for management of cases andreconstructive surgery at District Hospitals and MedicalColleges/Central Leprosy Institutions. Under NLEP, it is aimed to reduce G2D per million population to less than 1 per million population andzero G2D among new child cases. As a result of focusactive case detection combined with timely treatmentand management, G2D per million population was 1.10per million population and number of child patients withdisability were 35 as on 31st March, 2021. Under NELP, all the above-mentioned services are being provided uniformly to all segments of the society,including the STs and SCs population. However,statistics pertaining to the epidemiological status ofSTs& SCspopulation are separately collected andanalysed. The same are briefly presented as follows:- Epidemiological status of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes population Under the programme, state wise disaggregated data of tribal population is collected on monthly basis. Inthe year 2019\u201420 (as on 31 stMarch, 2020), out of total 1,14,451 new leprosy cases detected, 21,469(18.76%) were STs and 21,184 (18.51%) were SCs.During the year 2020-21 (as on 31 stMarch, 2021), out of total 65,147 new leprosy cases detected, 13,118(20.14%) were STs and 11,557 (17.74%) were SCs.As on 31 stAugust, 2021(during the year 2021-22), out of a total 26,275 new leprosy cases detected, 4639(17.65%) were STs and 4688 (17.84%) were SCs.

The States/UTsare responsible for the implementation of theprogramme, whereas the Directorate of NCVBDC, ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22 401 Delhi provides technical assistance and policy guidelines as also financial assistance to the States/UTs,as per approved norms. Under NCVBDC, promotive, preventive and curative (diagnosis and treatment) services are uniformly madeavailable to all segments of population including SCsand STs in all the States/UTs of the country. Strategiesfor VBD control are based on the endemicity ofdiseases. Malaria is more prevalent in North-EasternStates, and central States of Odisha, Chhattisgarh,Jharkhand, and Madhya Pradesh where SCs, STs,and low socio-economic population is more. In suchareas, special anti-malarial interventions includingoutreach activities for malaria prevention and controlare undertaken, especially in remote and inaccessibleareas. Additional support is being provided throughexternally aided Global Fund project in these States. A total of 25.2 million Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have been distributed to the communityresiding in high malaria endemic areas (sub centres withAnnual Parasite Incidence >1) in 2020-21. LLINusage has been highly appreciated and accepted bythe community at large, resulting in drastic decline inthe incidence of malaria in the country. The malariadisease burden in India has declined by 84% (from1.16 million to 0.18 million) and malaria deaths by 76%(from 384 to 93) in 2020 as compared to 2015.Among 177 tribal and Left Wing Extremist (LWE)districts, there has been 86.6% reduction in malariamorbidity and 83.4% reduction in malaria mortality in2020 as compared to 2015. For Kala-azar elimination, support by multilateral development partners is being provided in all fourendemic States of Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh andWest Bengal where too, there is a larger SC/STpopulation. 8.7 NATIONAL PROGRAMME FORCONTROL OF BLINDNESS & VISUALIMPAIRMENT (NPCB&VI) National Programme for Control of Blindness & VisualImpairment (NPCB&VI) is being implementeduniformly in all districts of the country.
