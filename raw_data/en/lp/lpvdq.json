But for a few days over the last year, those people, the King County Council, have been rhapsodizing about garlic pills and the healing power of ginkgo tree extract. In voting to establish the nation's first government-subsidized natural medicine clinic, the Republican-dominated council sounded like a therapy group discussing wonder cures. One member said he owed his good health to a dietary supplement of enzymes and vitamins. Another said acupuncture cured her of migraine headaches. A third member said she used botanical fluid to help her relax. The council, which governs the greater Seattle area, has unanimously voted to establish the naturopathic health clinic, in which diet, exercise, vitamins and treatments like acupuncture take precedence over drugs and the tools of conventional medicine. It hopes to use state or Federal money for a two-year pilot project beginning this year. Natural medicine, long considered to be on the fringe of health care, is reaching the mainstream, and to no greater extent than in this state. The new clinic will put the alternative treatments, which have been the province of better-educated and more affluent Americans, within reach of the poor. And as of Jan. 1, the state of Washington began requiring health insurance to cover treatments like acupuncture, massage therapy and other forms of licensed natural health care. No other state has gone as far in requiring coverage for such a broad variety of alternative medicine, said Deborah Senn, the State Insurance Commissioner. Ms. Senn, a Democrat, said she used acupuncture along with traditional medicine. When discussing natural medicine, Kent Pullen, the Republican who heads the King County Council, sounds like New Age apostle on a caffeine high. \"Evening primrose oil is great for migraines and saw palmetto can help an enlarged prostate,\" said Mr. Pullen, who holds a doctorate in chemistry. If the council action here is any indication, natural medicine could prove to be a sleeper political issue in the national health care debate. One-third of all Americans have at least once sought some form of alternative medical treatment, according to a study in 1993 in The New England Journal of Medicine. And many of those surveyed said they were afraid to tell their doctors about it. The $4 billion vitamin and dietary supplement industry is growing by nearly 15 percent a year while sales of many traditional drugs and over-the-counter remedies have been flat. When the Food and Drug Administration tried to restrict sales of certain vitamins and herbal remedies in 1994, there was an uproar that led Congress to slap down the stricter Federal requirements. Natural medicine, despite strong opposition from many experts who view it as quackery, is quickly taking root, supporters say. \"This clinic we're trying to set up here will be the Starbucks of the health care world,\" Merrily Manthey said, drawing an analogy between the first coffee bar set up in Seattle by the Starbucks Company and the fledgling King County clinic. As a trustee at both a naturopathic college and a big urban hospital in Seattle, Ms. Manthey has a foot in both camps. \"What's happening is a consumer driven demand,\" she said. \"People want to get well in a world where costs and an obsession with high technology are forcing cutbacks in conventional medicine.\" Responding to the demand, the National Institutes of Health set up an Office of Alternative Medicine in 1992. The office has given out millions of dollars in grants into research on how plants, vitamins, diet and exercise can help people. Bastyr University in Seattle, a school of natural medicine and a leading force in the movement, has been awarded an $850,000 Federal grant to study alternative ways of treating AIDS. Bastyr's enrollment was 914 students in 1995, a record high. Still, establishing the nation's first taxpayer-subsidized natural health clinic has not been easy. Though the county council has voted twice in the last year to go ahead with the clinic, officials have yet to figure out whether state, Federal or county money will be used to pay for the estimated $1 million to $2 million annual operating costs. The clinic has taken on symbolic importance beyond its size, which is to consist of several naturopaths working with medical doctors. Supporters say institutions that have the most to lose by the growth of natural medicine -- pharmaceutical companies and the medical establishment -- are fighting to keep alternative health care at the market's fringe. \"You can blame the trillion-dollar medical-industrial complex for the delay,\" said Joseph E. Pizzorno, president of Bastyr University, which will help run the clinic here. \"Fundamentally, if you can teach people how to take care of themselves, they don't need doctors, and that's seen as a threat by many people.\" Naturopaths emphasize diet and exercise for preventive care, and recommend vitamins, herbal remedies, massage, meditation and acupuncture for other problems. They shy from trying to treat most serious illnesses or major trauma, they say. Some medical doctors say that many claims of natural medicine are overblown, unproven or even outright fraud and that it is a mistake for governments to subsidize it in any form. Misuse or misdiagnosis by a naturopath can lead to severe complications, they say. Washington is one of only 10 states that licenses naturopathic doctors; other states report a thriving underground community of practitioners. New York does not license naturopaths. While professional groups representing medical doctors have not come out against the natural medicine clinic here, they remain somewhat skeptical. \"As long as they are held to the same kind of standards as we are, then we're not opposed to it,\" said Dr. George Rice, president of the Washington State Medical Association, which represents 7,000 medical doctors in the state. Several national studies have found that natural medicine remedies help with migraine headaches, chronic pain, frequent colds, stress and heart disease and could help prevent some cancers. But other studies and Federal health care officials say that many of the claims of natural medicine do not bear out. Mr. Pullen, the council president, said that when the trial period for the King County clinic was up, the clinic would go through \"a science-based data review\" to determine how effective it had been. But Mr. Pullen said he had no doubt that it would succeed. In a debate where personal anecdotes dominate, Mr. Pullen boasts of his own supplemental diet of enzymes, vitamins and minerals. In six years, he said, he has not had so much as a common "}
