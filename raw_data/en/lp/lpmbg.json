Maybe, you've heard the phrase, \"You are what you eat?\" Ultimately, we are what we choose. Every moment of every day, we are making a choice. We choose what time to get up in the morning, what clothes to wear, what to eat for breakfast, the route we drive to work, where we work, and on and on. Also, we are what we choose to think. If we choose to think that we are healthy, we will make choices that support and reflect that thought. However, if we choose to believe that we are unhealthy, or that we are powerless to make a change, or that outside circumstances are really at fault, then we will choose ac- tions that support and reinforce those choices. There is usually a reason behind the way we make our choices. Sometimes, the reason is even unconscious or a learned behavior that someone else taught us and that we never questioned. In this newsletter, we hope to inspire you to consciously examine the choices that you make, and if they are choices that do not support the person you are or want to be, we are confident that you will choose to change. Fear Based Ignorance Some choices are made out of ignorance and others out of fear. Perhaps, you didn't know better, or that's the way someone else always did it; that is a choice based on ignorance. Or, maybe someone said that if you didn't make the choice this way, something bad would happen: to you or your family. That is a choice made out of fear. Knowledge Based, Informed Decisions When you are presented with a choice, it is easy to say \"yes\" or give the re- sponse that is \"expected\" of you. However, to make the best choice for you and all involved, wouldn't it be better to research the information so that you have all the knowledge on the subject to make an informed decision? This way, fear and ignorance cannot sway you, because you know the facts: all the pros and cons, and now, you are equipped to choose what is truly best and what is most consistent with your own character.

NITE, Herb Etc. & NCC Natural Childbirth Education Classes (The Bradley Method) are a 12 week series of birthing classes that help to guide couples though the natural birthing process. They help to educate couples about pre- natal nutrition, physical training and relaxation techniques for labor, and confidence for the birth process and parenting. Also included is in- formation on the three phases of labor, what to expect when the baby arrives, proper techniques for breastfeeding and possible compli- cations throughout the process. These classes are meant to be inti- mate in order to give each couple the most privacy, best information, and all the attention needed. Classes will be kept to six couples or less. Couples will be provided with a workbook that will serve as a reference throughout the duration of their pregnancy, birth, and post- partum experience. Couples will also be provided with coaching and doula training which will assist the mother during labor. These classes provide the couples with a network- ing circle of other expectant cou- ples with which to share thoughts, feelings, ideas, and experiences. The Bradley Method classes will be held in two hour sessions, once a week, for 12 weeks. Most couples will want to begin these classes be- tween their 20th and 25th week of pregnancy. The Bradley Method teaches total body relaxation through natural belly breathing, is husband - coached, and incorporates proper pregnancy nutrition and pre -labor exercise techniques to prepare for labor.

Visit our website: www.nite -mtp.com Hair tissue mineral analysis is a non -invasive method of determining your levels of minerals and also the levels of toxic elements in your body. These levels help you and your naturopath to determine which areas of your body are out of balance, which areas are holding toxins or stress, where those stressors might be originating from, and what your metabolic type is. As hair grows, it is exposed to the internal environment of the body, including blood, lymph, and extracellular fluids. As hair continues to grow and reaches the surface of the skin, its outer layers harden, lock- ing in the metabolic products accumulated during its period of growth. Essentially, the hair provides a record of the mineral status and nutri- tional metabolism that occurred during this time. Because minerals are involved in cellular metabolism, structural support, muscle activity, nerve conduction, immune system functioning, hormone activity, and more, this information provides a great view of your health and the long -term effects of your diet, stress, and exposure to toxins. It is very easy to have a hair analysis done. First, contact your naturo- path (new clients are welcome, too!) at Herbs, Etc. Then, come in, and your naturopath will cut small pieces of hair from several areas on the back portion of your head. The hair to be collected should be clean and should not be permed, dyed, or bleached. It is best if the hair sample comes from as close to the scalp as possible. About one tablespoon of hair is needed for the analysis. Then, the hair is sent to Trace Ele- ments laboratory where it is analyzed. Once your naturopath receives the analysis report, you will schedule a consultation time to go over the results together. Also, you will be able to work with your naturopath on a health program to address any imbalances highlighted in the hair analysis results. The price of a hair analysis is $75.

This is an especially stressful choice for new parents who are pressured into vaccinating their minutes -old baby and who are mis- takenly told that their child cannot start school without having had their vaccinations. Dr. Tenpenny, whose DVD's are available in the Herbs, Etc. store, has done research using CDC statis- tics to disprove these claims and many other claims regarding vaccines and is a valuable source of knowledge. She points out that vac- cines do not guarantee immunization against a certain disease; there are unsafe ingredients in vaccines, in- cluding mercury, formaldehyde, and human and animal fetal tissue; and the frequency of vaccinations has not resulted in a proven decrease in any disease. Once you have done your own re- search, an informed choice would be to strengthen your immune system using natural remedies. Instead of the Shingles vaccine, you would consider VS -C, an anti -virus herbal blend, and NutriCalm, a B vitamin blend that calms the nerves and relieves stress. As a natural alternative to any other vaccine, like the flu shot, consider Silver Shield, Vitamin C, and Thieves essential oil in addition to the VS -C. There are also homeo- pathic immunizations available. For more information, consult one of the naturopaths at Herbs, Etc. body and help it regain balance. Many people search out natural alternatives to prescription medications. For example, good fats, like fish oil, flaxseed oil, and butter, are one of the best ways to naturally lower your cholesterol. A combination of B vitamins, magnesium, and amino Prescription medications are man -made drugs and have many dan- gerous side effects. They also do not aid the body in finding balance; they force the body to work against itself to prevent certain symptoms from occur- ring. Well, those symptoms are a sign for you to listen to your acids will help to balance in place of mood stabilizing medications. Why aren't we, as a society, told this? Why don't medical doctors give out this information? Your body is your own, and it is up to you to search out the informa- tion and make an informed decision for you.

Take a Shot at Something Natural: Vaccine Choices They approve plastic containers, because they consider what is a safe amount of exposure to the leaching chemicals over a life- time. How do they calculate that, and is any amount of expo- sure really safe? Plastics also contain Bisphenol A which is a xenoestrogen. This acts just like estrogen in the body, except it's foreign (xeno=foreign). Thus, this chemical disrupts the body's natural hormonal balance and can cause weight gain, insulin resis- tance, birth defects, and mis- carriages. It would be far safer for your water to wear glass or stainless steel. Time to shop for a new outfit for your water! Is your water wearing plastic? Maybe, it is time for a make- over. Plastics are created using petroleum. The FDA admits that, regarding plastic contain- ers, something will always leach out of the container and into the food or water. What Does Your Water Wear? Nutrition is a huge area for us to make healthy, conscious choices. The more we choose to eat unprocessed, unrefined, real, fresh, and organic foods the healthier we will be. However, let's highlight the dan- gers of false sweeteners. These show up in the forms of high fructose corn syrup, splenda (which is more chemically similar to chlorine than sugar), aspar- tame, nutrasweet, acesulfame -K, and even other names. Some products that you might find these in include diet pop, proc- essed foods, and any low -fat, low sugar products. These false sweeteners are highly toxic to the nervous sys- tem and are very addictive. They have been linked to weight gain, and aspartame has been shown to cause cancer. Many families have seen success with their children who were labeled \"ADHD\" simply by avoiding high fructose corn syrup. An educated choice would be to research and get to know the names of the fake sweeteners and to avoid buying any products that list them as ingredients. It would also be beneficial to know which sweeteners are not chemi- cals and are safe for the body to consume. Healthier sweeten- ers would be honey, maple syrup, and stevia. Even small changes add up to big results! to manufacture hormones and perform other functions. Cho- lesterol only becomes a problem when it sticks to arteries, and it only sticks to arteries when they have been scarred (usually, from drinking chlorinated water). There are many ways to keep your cholesterol levels naturally healthy. High triglyceride levels actually occur from consuming too many carbohydrates, not fats. Avoiding white, processed, refined carbohydrates and eat- ing grains like quinoa, millet, and buckwheat are best. And, you can raise your \"good\" cholesterol levels by eating saturated fats, especially butter and coconut oil. That's right: mmmm, butter! Many people are being told that their cholesterol levels are too high, and then, they are pre- scribed a medication (man -made drug) to lower it. Do you really want to lower your cholesterol? Cholesterol is manufactured by the body as well as obtained from the nutrition we eat. Cho- lesterol is needed by the body Our skin is the largest organ of our bodies, and it absorbs what it contacts, including hair prod- ucts, deodorants, and lotions. If these products have chemical ingredients, they are ab- sorbed into the body, and be-cause they cannot be broken down, they remain in the body as toxins which can detrimentally affect the liver, the spleen, the nerves, and other areas. For example, most deodorants contain aluminum, a heavy metal, which prevents your body from sweating. Sweating is a natural way that the body releases toxins and other waste materials. When these wastes Beauty Is a Big Deal Health, Sweet Health Do You Really Want to Lower Your Cholesterol? cannot be released, they clog the lymphatic system, namely in the area of the breast tissue, and can manifest into breast lumps. Look for deodorants that do not contain aluminum, and try to find shampoos, lo- tions, and other products with ingredients whose names you can pronounce and are safe for you both inside and out. In the field of natural health, we are looking for the root cause of an illness. To find it, we do not run expensive tests that require you to be exposed to radiation, or that stop the spin of your natural electromagnetic field, or that require you to swallow poisonous liquids. Our bodies are constantly giving us information about how well they are functioning, and they give us signs when we are out of balance. Every \"symptom\" is a sign; for example, headaches, pains, marks on the skin, red lines in the whites of the eye \u2014they are all signs. A naturopath is trained to read those signs and translate to you what they mean. Following is a list of non - invasive methods of assessing health; in other words, different ways to read the signs. Live Blood Analysis By looking at one drop of blood, under a dark -field microscope, you can see the quality of your red blood cells and your white blood cells. These and other markers in the blood relate to your digestion, immune system, levels of minerals, bacteria, parasites, en- ergy level, and more. Biological Terrain Assessment Also called Quantitative Fluid Analysis, this assessment takes a first morning urine sample and saliva sample after a 12 hour fast and determines min- eral levels, cellular energy metabolism, levels of hydration, digestion, antioxidants, and more. You receive a print out that shows which areas of the body are most stressed, and it even tells your biological age \u2014how old your body feels! Voice Analysis Speak into a microphone, and the notes in your voice are analyzed, revealing which notes are missing and which notes may be overused. Every organ, like a piano, is tuned to a certain note, or frequency, and imbalances in the notes of your voice will show which ar- eas of the body are \"out of tune.\" (See the NITE section for more specific information.) Muscle Response Testing This form of assessment uses a test muscle (for example, the arm) and the electromagnetic energy of the body to gauge responses to certain substances or even works with acupressure -type points on the body to evaluate the health of the organs. This type of evaluation is valuable for assessing hormones, parasites, amino acids, and much more. All of these assessments are available at Herbs, Etc.
