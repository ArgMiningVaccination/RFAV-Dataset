Side-effects with the COVID-19 vaccines are never pleasant and the hesitancy of developing the reactions have scared many into getting jabbed. With most of the reactogenic side-effects considered temporary inflammatory reactions, newer reports have highlighted that a lot of these side-effects are actually resultant of anxiety and not the vaccine in itself. A new study done by a government panel has observed that shockingly, over a 30% of the reported adverse events post-vaccination seen in India were linked to anxiety. Globally too, the rising fear of developing adverse reactions have pushed many off getting vaccinated and safeguarding their life. But what really explains the link between vaccination and anxiety? If so, what can we do to minimize our fears? [readmore](javascript://) 02/6What do the studies say? A report tabled by the National Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) Committee has observed that from a case study of people who had been vaccinated and recorded adverse reactions, over 22 people (out of 100) suffered from anxiety-related reactions. Similarly, over 18 cases were linked to having an inconsistent causal reaction to vaccines. The preliminary data thus revealed that in many of these cases, the sickness and side-effects were mostly related to factors unrelated to vaccination, such as incorrect use or vulnerability. Further findings also revealed that of the anxiety-related reactions, most events were related to the administration of Covishield vaccine, and most cases were diagnosed in women more than men.

While data released by the Indian government had revealed startling findings, similar reports are also available globally and proves for a fact that anxiety around COVID-19 vaccination is indeed, a concerning factor. Immunisation-related anxiety reactions, as they are termed as a range of symptoms or side-effects which arise around inoculation and related to anxiety, and not really the vaccine product in itself. While there can be a lot of reasons for anxiety to stem up in the first place, a common reason for hesitancy remains the fear, or phobia of needles( also referred to as trypanophobia). Recent studies have also indicated that needle phobia may be the cause of at least 10-15% of vaccine hesitancy cases in the UK and the US. Anxiety in itself can manifest into different reactions and symptoms. When it comes to vaccination, anxiety or irrational fear of any kind can lead to an internalized stress response, which then shows up through a number of vasovagal responses, which are very similar to some vaccination side-effects and inflammatory reactions.

Experts also believe that rising anxiety around COVID-19 vaccination can not just confuse precedence of post-vaccination side-effects, but also, in a way, hamper the efficacy of some of the COVID-19 vaccines as well. Anxiety and stress, both often linked to each other, are known to weaken the immune system, and in a way, impact the immune system's ability to fight off antigens. When stress rises, it triggers the release of cortisol in the body, which manifests into a number of reactions and release cytokines, which are a chemical that fuels inflammation in the body. Thus, it could happen that when a person faces an immense amount of stress or experiences anxiety, it may limit the vaccine's ability to prompt the right immune response and lead to more inflammation.

Right now, there's no correct classification of what side-effects post vaccination could be reactogenic, and which ones could be anxiety-related. However, having said that, since heightened stress levels fuel an internal physiological response that leads to a number of vasovagal reactions, some of the reported symptoms could be considered to be causative of anxiety, and not directly of the vaccine. As per case studies, some side-effects such as palpitations, elevated heart rate, nausea, fatigue, neurological symptoms such as shaking, weakness, dizziness or loss of consciousness could be linked to anxiety and extreme nervousness around vaccination. Do remember that these reactions could also be fueled by underlying conditions as well. In comparison to this, the most common and prevalent side-effects resultant of the vaccine administration are inflammatory in nature, such as running a mild fever, muscle pain, pain at the injection site, chills and weakness (flu-like reactions).

Anxiety and worry about getting jabbed can push you away from extracting the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination, and that's not a risk worth taking. Not only do experts agree that awareness and proper counselling could mitigate some of the anxiety-related reactions, but also limit vaccine hesitancy. Needle phobia can also make many actually refuse the vaccine, so fighting the underlying cause is important. One of the best things to do is to educate yourself on how vaccines work, and how the benefit outweigh the cons. People who encounter high-stress levels or are needle phobic could also work with counsellors to fight physiological responses which could strike during vaccination. Post-vaccination, to fight anxiety and related side-effects, patients can also try doing diaphragmatic breathing and meditation to alleviate fears.
