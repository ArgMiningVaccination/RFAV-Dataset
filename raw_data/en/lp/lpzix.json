COVID-19 has claimed about 3 million lives around the world making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history. It has been over a year since the outbreak of COVID-19 and countries are still struggling to recover from it as the virus has impacted almost every aspect of life. To break the chain and stop the spread of the virus, most governments were forced to impose lockdowns and strict restrictions on day to day activities. Fortunately, at the start of 2021, numerous vaccines across the world received emergency approval, including Covishield & Covaxin in India. Approximately 1.23 billion vaccine doses have been administered globally as of May 2021. The figures indicate a possible return to 'normalcy.' However, global [COVID-19 vaccination](https://www.onlymyhealth.com/covid-19-vaccination-drive-india-health-ministry-guidelines-1610786635) faces a number of challenges that could jeopardize its success. As the second wave COVID-19 set foot in India, it is extremely important to be vaccinated to control the spread of the virus. Onlymyhealth editorial team spoke to Dr. L. Sanjay, General Physician, Apollo Spectra Hospitals, Kondapur, Hyderabad, about the benefits of vaccination. Benefits of vaccination Many people, are skeptical of the vaccine while the healthcare community strongly recommends every individual to be vaccinated. Here are a few immediate benefits of vaccination: 1. Reduces the risk of infection The body begins to produce antibodies to the virus as soon as it receives the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The [immune system](https://www.onlymyhealth.com/health-videos/best-foods-to-boost-immunity-1586179230.html) will be able to fight the virus with the help of these antibodies, reducing one's chances of becoming infected. It is important to note that even after being immunized, people can contract the virus. However, once the majority of the population is immunized, the chances of becoming infected are further reduced due to herd immunity. People who get vaccinated not only reduce their chances of becoming infected but also contribute to community protection and reduce the possibility of virus transmission.

This means that if a person is vaccinated and becomes infected with the virus, their chances of becoming severely ill are reduced. Vaccinated people who become infected have a mild to moderate case compared to unvaccinated people. Once people have been fully immunized, the risk of death or hospitalization from coronavirus is almost eliminated. 3. It will help to ditch the mask eventually The COVID-19 vaccination is the only hope of returning to normalcy. Preventative health measures such as hand washing, physical separation, and mask use have slowed the virus' spread. People must continue to take these precautions until enough people have been vaccinated. Physical distancing and wearing masks will no longer be necessary once the population has reached herd immunity and the spread becomes unlikely. 4. It will help to reconnect with the loved ones People will be able to visit other vaccinated people once they have been vaccinated and have waited the required time for the body to build immunity.
