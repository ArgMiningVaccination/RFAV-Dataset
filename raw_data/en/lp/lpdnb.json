Double up on your vitamin C, don't forget to wash your hands, keep your distance, and minimize stress as best as you can. How Are You Taking Care of Yourself? In addition to prioritizing health and hygiene, an element of wellness that is often forgotten is what is already in our body. We are exposed to toxins every day and they find their way into our bodies through consumption, breathing, and physical contact. The Toxins Around Us If you live in a city you are probably [exposed to some degree of smog](https://education.seattlepi.com/major-chemical-found-smog-4567.html). This means you're inhaling sulfur dioxide from industrial emissions, nitrogen oxides from vehicle emissions, and hydrocarbons from burning fossil fuels. These are all toxins, each potentially harmful. Additionally, a number of toxins can be found in the plastic surrounding our food, beauty products, and bottled water. [Phthalates, bisphenol-A (BPA), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)](https://www.madesafe.org/avoid-toxic-chemicals-plastics/) are all in certain plastics and are linked to cancer, hormone imbalance and other health risks. Some of these are virtually unavoidable in modern life and they may take a toll on our health without us even realizing. When our bodies are filled with toxins, it makes it harder for it to do its job. This is never ideal, but it's vital to support our immune system in these trying times. A Body and Spirit Detox It is important for us to reset and strengthen our bodies through detox. Ridding our bodies of toxins removes any strains on the system and keeps us functioning efficiently. Plus, they're a welcome respite from the world right now... and the perfect opportunity for self-care. After searching for some all-natural ways to detox, I found [Wellness Mama's natural detoxifying baths](https://wellnessmama.com/8331/detox-bath-recipes/). Here is what I found worked best for me. Clay Detox Bath Bentonite clay is one of my favorite things to put on my skin in any capacity, so this detox bath really spoke to me. The clay binds to heavy metals, pulling them out of your skin. It also promotes circulation throughout the body and helps with immunity by killing harmful bacteria. Ingredients: - \u00bd cup bentonite clay - \u00bd cup Epsom salts - Calming essential oils as needed Instructions First add the epsom salt and essential oils to your warm or hot bath water (the hotter the water, the more detoxifying it is). The epsom salt also helps remove toxins from your body, as well as replenishes magnesium. There are two ways to include bentonite clay in your bath. You can either mix the clay with water in a non-metal bowl until there are no more lumps and then add that mixture to your bath. Or you could stand in your bath and apply a coat of the thicker clay/water mixture to your body, let it sit, and then get in the bath. Mustard Detox Bath Mustard powder has historically been used as a natural remedy for colds and the flu. This spice is known for its soothing properties and boost circulation to promote healthy skin and muscles. By invigorating your bodily systems it will help your body naturally rid itself of toxins. Ingredients: - \u00bc cup of organic mustard powder - 1 cup of epsom salts - Essential oils if desired Instructions: Create your mixture in a bowl as you run your bath, then simply add your mustard bath mixture to your bath water. After taking a bath, use a soft towel to dry off, then [apply orgainic body care products](https://shop.annmariegianni.com/collections/body-care) like our [Coconut Body Oil](https://shop.annmariegianni.com/products/coconut-body-oil-100ml) to moisturize and soften your skin. Mental and Spiritual Health As we know, health is holistic, so while we detox our bodies we should keep our mental and spiritual health in mind. Give your spirit a little reset as well with a new mantra to cleanse you of any emotional or creative blockage that sometimes accompanies the winter season and all the head colds and brain fog that comes with it. Incorporating Your Mantra By repeating your mantra as you physically detox your body you are syncing up multiple areas of wellness, for a well-rounded, fresh start. The mantra I chose with the idea of honoring my health and focusing on the good I have been given went like this: I know in life all things must come to an end So let me give thanks for the present And rejoice in every moment I am exactly where I am suppose to be And I love all the time I am given I have very loosely taken and adapted the idea of the [Om Jum Saha mantra found in both the Rig Veda and the Yajur Veda](http://www.puja.net/wordpress/10-boosting-your-immunity/) which talks about victory over death and is used to boost overall health and resistance.
