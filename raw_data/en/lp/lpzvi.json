Complementary therapies are used to improve wellness, prevent disease or treat health problems. Acupuncture, yoga, massage, Chinese Medicine, herbal remedies, and acupressure are just several of many complementary medicines. People who practice complementary medicine believe in treating the physical, mental, and spiritual elements of wellness (a \"holistic\" approach) rather than focusing on treating symptoms of disease. This appeals to some people with chronic illnesses or those making lifestyle changes to maintain wellness. Keep in mind that some forms of complementary medicine are supported by scientific studies, while others are currently being evaluated for their safety and effectiveness. What is the difference between \"complementary\" and \"alternative\" medicine? Alternative medicine is used instead of conventional medicine - for example, using St. John's wort (a herbal remedy) for mild-to-moderate depression instead of conventional anti-depressant medications. Complementary medicine, however, is used in combination with conventional medicine - for example, using acupuncture and massage combined with pain relievers (for chronic pain), or using yoga and deep breathing combined with anxiety medications (for panic attacks). The combination of conventional and complementary medicine is often called integrative medicine. This combination should be used on the advice of a physician and pharmacist, as there are some combinations of herbal products and traditional medications that can be dangerous.

Herbal medicines are extracts from plants and flowers used to prevent and treat illness. Herbal remedies have been used for a wide range of conditions, from headaches to depression, PMS to insomnia. Most health food stores contain hundreds of bottles or packages of tablets containing various herbal preparations. Some common herbs include: - chamomile: Commonly used as a tea, chamomile may help promote relaxation and improve some digestive problems. - St. John's wort: Available orally as tablets, a tincture, and a liquid extract, this herb may help to treat mild-to-moderate depression and anxiety. It is also available for topical use (applied to the skin) for minor skin wounds and injuries. St. John's wort can interact with many medications including prescription antidepressants, immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine), anti-HIV medications, cholesterol-lowering medications, (e.g., warfarin), anti-epilepsy medications (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine), and thyroid medications. If you are taking other medications, talk to a health care professional before taking this herb. - saw palmetto: Available in tablets, capsules, tea, and liquid forms, this herb may help improve the symptoms of mild-to-moderate benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a condition where the prostate gland is enlarged. This herb should not be taken with finasteride, flutamide, or other androgen medications. - ginger: This herb may help decrease nausea caused by pregnancy and ease motion sickness. It's available as capsules and tablets. Since ginger may lower blood sugar levels, careful monitoring is necessary for people taking diabetes medications. - glucosamine: Often used to treat joint pain and stiffness related to arthritis and sports injuries, glucosamine can affect sugar levels in diabetics and therefore should be used with caution and under the supervision of a doctor. A word of caution Although there is some scientific evidence showing that certain herbs have health benefits, much of the information is limited to individual reports or small scientific studies. Many have not yet undergone the same testing and approval procedure as prescription and over-the-counter medications. If you're considering buying a herbal product, talk to your pharmacist or doctor first. Many herbs can affect prescription and non-prescription medications and should not be taken by people with certain medical conditions. Look for the Natural Product Number, or NPN, on products sold in Canada. A product with an NPN indicates that Health Canada has assessed the product for safety, quality, and effectiveness under its health claim. Make sure you know: - if there is evidence to support the use of the herb - if the herb can interact with other medications or vitamins - what side effects are associated with the herb - what medical conditions the herb should not be used for - how to take and store the herb properly Note that Health Canada has recalled or issued warnings about the use of certain herbal products because of toxicity, or due to harmful interactions with prescription or over-the-counter medications. Recalled products include the herbs kava and ephedra (ma huang). If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you are considering becoming pregnant, always talk to your doctor and pharmacist before taking any herbal products.

Homeopathy maintains that symptoms of illness are the body's normal and natural way of healing itself, and microscopic doses remind the body of these symptoms and stimulate the healing process. How small are the doses? A fairly common strength is 6X, which is made by diluting one part of the substance in nine parts of water, and then diluting the result in the same 9:1 ratio five more times, for a total of six 9:1 dilutions. This results in a one-in-1,000,000 dilution. Greater dilutions are believed to have deeper and longer-lasting effects; doses can get up to 200X, or 200 repetitions of a one-in-10 dilution, which is equivalent to one molecule in 10200 molecules of water (about 3x10174 litres of water). Homeopathy was founded in the late 1700s, and its fundamental principles remain unchanged, but it has gained greater regulation and standardization in more recent years. A word of caution Many homeopathic dilutions are not regulated as closely as prescription medications and may contain other substances that could be harmful to certain people. Look for the DIN-HM, or Homeopathic Medicine number, on products sold in Canada. A product with a DIN-HM indicates that Health Canada has assessed the product for safety, quality, and effectiveness under its health claim. Some critics caution that the concentration of active substance in a particular homeopathic dose is too low to have any health benefits. Homeopathic remedies should not replace traditional treatments for serious illnesses. For more information Most provinces have a centre for homeopathic medicine or a listing of registered homeopaths.

Rather, it is an entire system, developed over the course of millennia, that is founded on a specific view of how the human body functions. The human body, in this perspective, has a natural energy called qi (or chi, both pronounced \"chee\") that flows along pathways in the body called meridians, and health depends on a balance of opposing forces (yin and yang) in the body. When the flow becomes blocked or the forces become unbalanced, illness results. TCM aims through a variety of means to restore and maintain the flow of qi and the balance of yin and yang. It makes use of therapies such as acupuncture, acupressure, massage, herbs, changes to the diet, and a practice known as qi gong, which involves exercise, breathing, and meditation. TCM is used as complementary therapy for a wide variety of illnesses, but there are no definitive studies to support its effectiveness for this. A word of caution Look for the Natural Product Number, or NPN, on herbal products sold in Canada. A product with an NPN indicates that Health Canada has assessed the product for safety, quality, and effectiveness under its health claim. Keep in mind that herbal products may interact with prescription medications. For more information If you decide to seek traditional Chinese medicine treatment, talk to your doctor first. They may be able to recommend a suitable practitioner in your area. In Canada, some provinces regulate practitioners of TCM, which ensures that only people who are qualified and registered to practice TCM and are accountable to the TCM regulatory body can deliver these services. Acupuncture The facts Acupuncture is a specific kind of traditional Chinese medicine. It has been practised for over 5,000 years. It involves inserting thin needles into the skin at key points to stimulate energy flow. This stimulation, it is believed, helps rebalance the yin and yang and unblock the flow of qi. Acupressure is similar to acupuncture but uses pressure instead of needles. It is uncertain exactly how acupuncture works, but it does have a well-established history. Some theories hold that it stimulates certain hormones or other chemicals in the body; others attribute its effects to direct action on the nerves. Acupuncture is most commonly used to treat pain and conditions where pain is a key symptom - for example, headaches, menstrual cramps, lower back pain, osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia. It is also used to treat asthma and allergies, and there have been clinical trials of acupuncture for the treatment of anxiety and depression. A word of caution If you are seeking acupuncture treatment, be sure to find a certified practitioner. Ask your doctor to recommend a licensed acupuncturist in your area and discuss any concerns you have about the safety of this therapy. In Canada, some provinces regulate acupuncturists, which ensures that only people who are qualified and registered to practice acupuncture and are accountable to the acupuncture regulatory body can deliver these services.
