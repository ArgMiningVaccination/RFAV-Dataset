Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder that can damage tissue or cause lesions to form in one or more places in the body. [Langerhans cell histiocytosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=471787&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (LCH) is a rare disease that begins in LCH [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). LCH cells are a type of [dendritic cell](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44948&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that normally helps the body fight [infection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Sometimes [mutations](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46063&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (changes) develop in [genes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that control how dendritic cells function. These include mutations of the [BRAF](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=561325&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), MAP2K1, [RAS](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45859&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and ARAF genes. These mutations may cause too many LCH cells to grow and build up in certain parts of the body, where they can damage [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or form [lesions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46324&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It is not known whether LCH is a form of cancer or a cancer-like disease. Doctors who treat [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) also treat LCH, and sometimes they use cancer [therapies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to treat this disease. For more information, see the sections on the [treatment of LCH in children](/types/langerhans/patient/langerhans-treatment-pdq#_318) and the [treatment of LCH in adults](/types/langerhans/patient/langerhans-treatment-pdq#_236). Family history of cancer or having a parent who was exposed to certain chemicals may increase the risk of LCH. Anything that increases a person's risk of getting a disease is called a [risk factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Not every child with one or more of these risk factors will develop LCH, and it will develop in some children who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for LCH may include the following: - Having a parent who was exposed to certain [solvents](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463162&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - Having a parent who was exposed to metal, granite, or wood dust in the workplace. - Having a [family history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=302456&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)of cancer or LCH. - Having a [personal history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642021&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or family history of [thyroid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46036&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)disease. - Having infections as a newborn. - Smoking, especially in young adults. - Being Hispanic. - Not being [vaccinated](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44841&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)as a child. The signs and symptoms of LCH depend on where it is in the body. These and other [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be caused by LCH or by other [conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Check with your doctor if you or your child have any of the following: Bone Signs or symptoms of LCH that affects the bone may include: - Swelling or a lump over a bone, such as the [skull](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=763008&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), jawbone, ribs, [pelvis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46246&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [spine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=415914&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), thigh bone, upper arm bone, elbow, [eye socket](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797677&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or bones around the ear. - Pain where there is swelling or a lump over a bone. Children with LCH lesions in bones around the ears or eyes have a high risk of [diabetes insipidus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=683346&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and other [central nervous system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46481&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) diseases. Skin and nails LCH in infants may affect the skin only. In some cases, skin-only LCH may get worse over weeks or months and become a form called high-risk multisystem LCH.

Signs or symptoms of LCH that affects the [thyroid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46036&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may include: - Swollen thyroid gland. [Hypothyroidism](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44547&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This can cause tiredness, lack of energy, being sensitive to cold, [constipation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407757&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), dry skin, thinning hair, memory problems, trouble concentrating, and [depression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430479&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In infants, this can also cause a loss of [appetite](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454699&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and choking on food. In children and adolescents, this can cause behavior problems, weight gain, slow growth, and late puberty. - Trouble breathing. Eye Signs or symptoms of LCH that affects the eye may include: - Vision problems or blindness. Central nervous system (CNS) Signs or symptoms of LCH that affects the CNS ( [brain](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [spinal cord](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=340937&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) may include: - Loss of balance, uncoordinated body movements, and trouble walking. - Trouble speaking. - Trouble seeing. - Headaches. - Changes in behavior or personality. - Memory problems. These signs and symptoms may be caused by lesions in the CNS or by CNS [neurodegenerative syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=687218&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Liver and spleen Signs or symptoms of LCH that affects the [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [spleen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46593&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may include: Lung Signs or symptoms of LCH that affects the [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may include: - Collapsed lung.

[Fever](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450108&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - Frequent infections. Tests that examine the organs and body systems where LCH may occur are used to diagnose LCH. In addition to asking about your [health history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=798522&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and doing a [physical exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) LCH or conditions caused by LCH: [Complete blood count (CBC) with differential](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=729979&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A procedure in which a sample of [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is drawn and checked for the following: - The amount of [hemoglobin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45108&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(the [protein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)that carries [oxygen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=538149&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) in the [red blood cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46124&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells. - The number and type of [white blood cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45993&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - The number of red blood cells and [platelets](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45840&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - The amount of [Blood chemistry studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304685&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the body by [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. [Liver function test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390293&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A [blood test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=688783&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)to measure the blood levels of certain substances released by the [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A high or low level of these substances can be a sign of disease in the liver. - BRAF [gene testing](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46128&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A [laboratory test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46590&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for certain mutations in the BRAF gene. [Urinalysis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46641&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A test to check the color of [urine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46642&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and its contents, such as sugar, protein, red blood cells, and white blood cells. [Water deprivation test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=683536&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A test to check how much urine is made and whether it becomes concentrated when little or no water is given. This test is used to diagnose diabetes insipidus, which may be caused by LCH. [Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=669655&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): The removal of [bone marrow](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone. A [pathologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46244&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)views the bone marrow and bone under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)to look for signs of LCH. The following test may be done on the tissue that was removed: [Immunohistochemistry](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=653117&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A laboratory test that uses [antibodies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44918&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)to check for certain [antigens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46086&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)( [markers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45776&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) in a sample of a patient's tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an [enzyme](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46081&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer. [Bone scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46499&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells in the bone. A very small amount of [radioactive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46550&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)material is [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones with LCH and is detected by a [scanner](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386220&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [X-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the body. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. Sometimes a [skeletal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44350&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)survey is done. This is a procedure to x-ray all the bones in the body. [CT scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. [MRI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45788&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(magnetic A procedure that uses a magnet, [radio waves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651209&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A substance called [gadolinium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=597153&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)may be injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the LCH cells so that they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). [PET scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46140&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive [glucose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. [Ultrasound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46157&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a [sonogram](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The picture can be printed to be looked at later. [Pulmonary function test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=658018&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(PFT): A test to see how well the lungs are working. It measures how much air the lungs can hold and how quickly air moves into and out of the lungs. It also measures how much oxygen is used and how much [carbon dioxide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=538147&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is given off during breathing. This is also called lung function test. [Bronchoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45628&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A procedure to look inside the [trachea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46623&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and large airways in the lung for [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)areas. A [bronchoscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46496&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is inserted through the nose or mouth into the trachea and lungs. A bronchoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a [lens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=572035&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of LCH. [Endoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)areas in the [gastrointestinal tract](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46189&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or lungs. An [endoscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46428&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is inserted through an [incision](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46353&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(cut) in the skin or opening in the body, such as the mouth. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a [lens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=572035&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease. [Biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45164&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for LCH cells. To diagnose LCH, a biopsy of bone, skin, lymph nodes, liver, or other sites of disease may be done. Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. LCH in organs such as the skin, bones, lymph nodes, or [pituitary gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46229&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) usually gets better with treatment and is called \"low-risk.\" LCH in the [spleen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46593&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), liver, or bone marrow is harder to treat and is called \"high-risk.\" Children with LCH in high-risk organs and the [gastrointestinal tract](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46189&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have a greater risk of not [responding](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44085&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to treatment than patients with high-risk LCH and no disease in the gastrointestinal tract. High-risk LCH is usually seen in children younger than 2 years. The [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and treatment options depend on the following: - Which organs or body systems are affected by LCH. - How many organs or body systems the LCH affects. - Whether LCH is found in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, or certain bones in the skull. - How quickly LCH responds to initial treatment. - Whether there are certain mutations in the BRAF gene. - Whether LCH has just been diagnosed or has come back ( [recurred](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). In infants up to 1 year of age, LCH may go away without treatment. Stages of LCH Key Points - There is no standard staging system for Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). - Treatment of LCH is based on where LCH cells are found in the body and whether the LCH is low risk or high risk. - Sometimes LCH continues to grow or comes back after treatment. There is no standard staging system for Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). The process used to find out if [ cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has spread to other parts of the body is called [staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). There is no standard [staging system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=689095&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for [LCH](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=513054&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Treatment of LCH is based on where LCH cells are found in the body and whether the LCH is low risk or high risk. LCH is described as single-system disease or multisystem disease, depending on how many body systems are affected: - Single-system LCH: LCH is found in one part of an [organ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or body system or in more than one part of that organ or body system. Bone is the most common single place for LCH to be found. - Multisystem LCH: LCH is found in two or more organs or body systems or may be found throughout the body. Multisystem LCH is less common than single-system LCH. LCH may affect low-risk organs or high-risk organs: - Low-risk organs the [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [spleen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46593&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [bone marrow](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Sometimes LCH continues to grow or comes back after treatment. [Progressive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45850&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) LCH describes LCH that continues to grow, spread, or get worse. Progressive disease may be a sign that the LCH has become [refractory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=350245&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to treatment. Refractory LCH describes LCH that does not [respond](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44085&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to initial treatment. [Recurrent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45862&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [reactivated](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=683532&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) LCH describes LCH that has come back after it has been treated. Many patients with LCH get better with treatment. However, when treatment stops, new [lesions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46324&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may appear or old lesions may come back. This is called reactivation (recurrence) and may occur within 1 year after stopping treatment. Patients with multisystem disease are more likely to have a reactivation. Common sites of reactivation are bone, ears, or skin. [Diabetes insipidus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=683346&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) also may develop. Less common sites of reactivation include lymph nodes, bone marrow, spleen, liver, or lung. Some patients may have more than one reactivation. Treatment Option Overview for LCH Key Points - There are different types of treatment for patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). - Children with LCH should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood cancer or LCH. - Nine types of standard treatment are used to treat LCH. - Chemotherapy - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Photodynamic therapy - Immunotherapy - Targeted therapy - Other drug therapy - Stem cell transplant - Observation - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Treatment for Langerhans cell histiocytosis may cause side effects. - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed. There are different types of treatment for patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). Different types of treatments are available for patients with [LCH](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=513054&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some treatments are [standard](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A treatment clinical trial is a [research study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Whenever possible, patients should take part in a clinical trial in order to receive new types of treatment for LCH. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials). Choosing the most appropriate treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team. Children with LCH should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood cancer or LCH. Treatment will be overseen by a [pediatric oncologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=693555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other [pediatric](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46245&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [healthcare providers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=650566&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) who are experts in treating children with LCH and who specialize in certain areas of [medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These may include the following [specialists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478785&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Nine types of standard treatment are used to treat LCH. Although it is unknown whether LCH is a type of cancer, some of the treatments used for cancer are effective at treating LCH. Chemotherapy [Chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that uses [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to stop the growth of cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Chemotherapy that is taken by mouth or [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or muscle enters the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( [systemic chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=301626&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). Chemotherapy may also be applied to the skin in a cream or lotion ( [topical chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46619&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). Chemotherapy may be given by injection, by mouth, or applied to the skin to treat LCH. Surgery [Surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be used to remove LCH [lesions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46324&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and a small amount of nearby healthy [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Curettage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46459&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a type of surgery that uses a [curette](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46460&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a sharp, spoon-shaped tool) to scrape LCH cells from bone. When there is severe [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) damage, the entire organ may be removed and replaced with a healthy liver or lung from a [donor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643010&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Radiation therapy [Radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy [x-rays](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other types of [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. [External radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46686&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. [Ultraviolet B](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=666695&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (UVB) radiation therapy may be given using a special lamp that directs radiation toward LCH skin lesions. Photodynamic therapy [Photodynamic therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45238&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of [laser](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45748&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) light to kill cancer cells. A drug that is not active until it is exposed to light is injected into a vein. The drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells. For LCH, laser light is aimed at the skin and the drug becomes active and kills the cancer cells. Photodynamic therapy causes little damage to healthy tissue. Patients who have photodynamic therapy should not spend too much time in the sun. In one type of photodynamic therapy, called [psoralen and ultraviolet A](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439423&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (PUVA) therapy, the patient receives a drug called [psoralen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44900&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and then [ultraviolet A radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=666694&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is directed to the skin. Immunotherapy [Immunotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45729&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a treatment that uses the patient's [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. [Thalidomide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45458&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a type of immunotherapy used to treat LCH. Targeted therapy [Targeted therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270742&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. There are different types of targeted therapy: [BRAF inhibitors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750801&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)block [proteins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)needed for cell growth and may kill cancer cells. The BRAF [gene](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is found in a [mutated](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44133&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(changed) form in some LCH and blocking it may help keep LCH cells from growing. [Vemurafenib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=702051&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and [dabrafenib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750069&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)are BRAF inhibitors used to treat LCH. [Trametinib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is a BRAF inhibitor that is being studied in the treatment of certain childhood tumors for use alone or combined with [dabrafenib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750069&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Monoclonal antibodies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46066&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)are [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [proteins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)made in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these antibodies can attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by [infusion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45738&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). They may be used alone or to carry drugs, [toxins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [radioactive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46550&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)material directly to cancer cells. [Rituximab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45525&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is a monoclonal antibody used to treat LCH. Other drug therapy Other drugs used to treat LCH include the following: [Steroid therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45111&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as [prednisone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45492&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), is used to lesions. [Bisphosphonate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44817&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(such as [pamidronate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45175&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [zoledronate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45500&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [alendronate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45355&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) is used to treat LCH lesions of the bone and to lessen bone pain. [Anti-inflammatory drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=489392&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)are drugs (such as [pioglitazone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=410212&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and [rofecoxib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45083&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) that are commonly used to decrease [fever](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450108&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), swelling, pain, and redness. Anti-inflammatory drugs and chemotherapy may be given together to treat adults with bone LCH. Stem cell transplant Chemotherapy is given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including blood-forming cells, are destroyed by the LCH treatment. [Stem cell transplant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46695&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or [bone marrow](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the patient or a [donor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643010&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an [infusion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45738&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells. Observation [Observation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45981&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is closely [monitoring](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454803&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) a patient's [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) without giving any treatment until [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) appear or change. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. Information about clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials). Treatment for Langerhans cell histiocytosis may cause side effects. For information about [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that begin during treatment for cancer, see our [Side Effects](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects) page. Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called [late effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390292&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following: - Slow growth and development. [Hormone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)imbalance. - Hearing loss. - Bone, tooth, liver, and lung problems. - Changes in mood, feeling, behavior, learning, thinking, or memory. [Second Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. For more information, see [Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer](/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-pdq). Many patients with multisystem LCH have late effects caused by treatment or by the disease itself. These patients often have long-term health problems that affect their [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a [clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the [standard treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from [recurring](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (coming back) or reduce the [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI's [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/search) webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) website. Follow-up tests may be needed. LCH patients should be monitored for many years because of the risk of reactivation ( [recurrence](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45861&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). Some of the tests that were done to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) LCH may be repeated. This is to see how well the treatment is working and if there are any new lesions. These tests may include: Other tests that may be needed include: [Brain stem auditory evoked response (BAER) test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=683250&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A test that measures the brain's response to clicking sounds or certain tones to detect some types of hearing loss. [Pulmonary function test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=658018&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(PFT): A test to see how well the lungs are working. It measures how much air the lungs can hold and how quickly air moves into and out of the lungs. It also measures how much [oxygen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=538149&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is used and how much [carbon dioxide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=538147&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is given off during breathing. This is also called a lung function test. [Chest x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called [follow-up](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44671&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tests or check-ups. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Treatment of Low-Risk LCH in Children For information about the treatments listed below, see the [Treatment Option Overview](/types/langerhans/patient/langerhans-treatment-pdq#_63) section. Skin Lesions Treatment of newly diagnosed childhood [Langerhans cell histiocytosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=471787&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (LCH) skin [lesions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46324&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may include: [Observation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45981&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

[Targeted therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270742&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)( [vemurafenib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=702051&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). [Stem cell transplant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46695&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Treatments being studied for progressive, refractory, or recurrent childhood LCH include the following: - A [clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)that tailors the patient's treatment based on features of the LCH at [diagnosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and how it [responds](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44085&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)to treatment. - A clinical trial that checks a sample of the patient's [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)for certain [gene](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)changes. The type of targeted therapy that will be given to the patient depends on the type of change. - A clinical trial of targeted therapy ( [trametinib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and [dabrafenib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750069&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). Treatment of LCH in Adults [Langerhans cell histiocytosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=471787&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (LCH) in adults is a lot like LCH in children and can form in the same [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and systems as it does in children. These include the [endocrine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=468796&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and tract](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46189&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). adults, LCH is most commonly found in the [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) as a single-system disease. In some patients, other organs may be involved, including bone, skin, [hypothalamus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46359&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [pituitary gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46229&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). LCH in the lung occurs more often in young adults who smoke. As in children, the signs and [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of LCH depend on where it is found in the body. See the [General Information](/types/langerhans/patient/langerhans-treatment-pdq#_289) section for the signs and symptoms of LCH. Tests that examine the organs and body systems where LCH may occur are used to detect (find) and [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) LCH. See the [General Information](/types/langerhans/patient/langerhans-treatment-pdq#_279) section for tests and procedures used to diagnose LCH. In adults, there is not a lot of information about what treatment works best. Sometimes, information comes only from reports of the diagnosis, treatment, and [follow-up](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44671&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of one adult or a small group of adults who were given the same type of treatment. Adult patients with LCH have higher rates of other cancers than do adults of the same age without LCH. These cancers may be found before, at the same time, or after an LCH diagnosis, and occur more in patients who smoke. For information about the treatments listed below, see the [Treatment Option Overview](/types/langerhans/patient/langerhans-treatment-pdq#_63) section. Lung Lesions Treatment for [LCH](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=513054&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in adults may include: - Quitting smoking. Lung damage will get worse over time in patients who do not quit smoking. In patients who quit smoking, lung damage may get better or it may get worse over time. [Chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - Lung [transplant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46631&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)for patients with severe lung damage. [Steroid therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45111&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Sometimes LCH of the lung will go away or not get worse even if it's not treated. Bone Lesions Treatment for [LCH](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=513054&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that affects only the bone in adults may [rofecoxib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45083&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) with chemotherapy. Skin Lesions Treatment for [LCH](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=513054&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that affects only the skin in adults may include: [Steroid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45111&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or other [methotrexate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45393&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [thalidomide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45458&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [hydroxyurea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45308&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Treatment for LCH that affects the skin and other body systems in adults may include: - Chemotherapy. Single-System and Multisystem Disease Treatment of single-system and multisystem disease in adults that does not affect the [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), bone, or skin may include: For more about [LCH](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=513054&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) trials for adults, see the [Histiocyte Society](http://www.histiocytesociety.org/) website.

To Learn More About Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis For more from the [National Cancer Institute](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44266&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) about Langerhans cell histiocytosis treatment, see the following: For more childhood [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) information and other general cancer resources, see [Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/types/aya) [Children with Cancer: for Adolescents](https://www.cancer.gov/types/childhood-cancers/child-adolescent-cancers-fact-sheet) [Staging](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/diagnosis-staging/staging) [Coping Ask Your Cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/coping/questions) [For Survivors and Caregivers](https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/ocs/resources/survivors.html) About This PDQ Summary About PDQ Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq). PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government's center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. Purpose of This Summary This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of childhood and adult Langerhans cell histiocytosis. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Reviewers and Updates Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/pediatric-treatment). Clinical Trial Information A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center) (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
