Lui, LAc The stories we hold, our life's experiences can be carried in and on our bodies and on our faces. Aging is beautiful, and a unique process for us each to embrace. Each line, each mark, every scar, expresses a moment/ time of our life. Yet we can be our own hardest critics, and find fault, and loss in our changing faces. We can also encounter too much sun, illness /pathology, acne, and scaring. Creating areas of concern that impact how we feel inside. Alternatively, our physiological health will impact our face. Both are nurtured in these sessions. Like most conditions, facial acupuncture focuses on the root cause of the acne, or skin condition presenting. Scars or breakouts can be targeted with needles to help the blood flow and healing response. This signals the body to send more blood and white blood cells to the area, focusing on bacteria under the skin. The response also builds more collagen to help with scars and hyper-pigmentation. What is Facial Acupuncture? A Facial acupuncture treatment uses hair-thin needles gently inserted into specific points on the face and body to boost collagen, lift and tighten facial muscles and reduce wrinkles. while treating root underlying health concerns. What are the Benefits of Facial Acupuncture? Facial Acupuncture can: Improve muscle tone Tighten facial muscles Boost collagen production Even skin tone and discoloration Lift the skin around the eyes, neck and mouth Treat acne Soothe sun damage and other dermatological conditions Reduce stress Benefit other conditions such as digestion, insomnia, fatigue, stress, pain HOW DOES IT WORK? Facial acupuncture acts to nourish, re-hydrate, tone, and reduce wrinkles but it also treats the other underlying conditions that contribute to cellular breakdown and aging. Certain points on the face are stimulated that work to increase oxygen flow and helps to stimulate the fibroblast cells that are deep within the dermis layer of the skin, promoting the production of new collagen and elastin. This is a great long-term solution for signs of aging and other issues such as digestive problems, acute or chronic pain, stress, insomnia, fatigue, emotional imbalances. Facial Acupuncture is a safe, non toxic, softening-with-aging treatment. Without going under the knife, this technique can help repair superficial wrinkles, reduce inflammation and increase blood flow to the skin. Body acupuncture points are also applied to balance and relax the body. The combination is a safe, effective, restorative and de-stressing beauty treatment. HOW OFTEN? Unlike most popular beauty treatments (think Botox), facial acupuncture addresses not just the topical and superficial signs of premature aging but the true internal impacts of aging by stimulating and channeling the body's healing energy towards 'repairing' the skin. Facial acupuncture stimulates the body's ability to regenerate itself. Although the skin will look revitalized after your initial treatment, results accumulate over time as your body is creating new collagen. We recommended a course of 10 - 15 treatments for substantial long-term results with three to four in the space of one to two months, followed by monthly or bi-monthly repeat treatments.
