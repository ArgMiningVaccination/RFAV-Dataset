It prevents you from developing serious COVID -19 Disease. It helps to get our country back to normal as soon as possible. Is it Safe? Two advisory committees reviewed all safety information and recommended the vaccines be approved by the FDA. The adviso- ry committees are scientists and are not government employees or politicians. Everyone who received the vaccine in the study was monitored for 8 weeks for any side effects although the FDA normally only requires 6 weeks of monitoring. Were Minorities Included In The Studies? Yes, different racial and ethnic groups were in the studies. An African American female was one of the scientists who dis- covered the technology used to make the vaccine. 2 Pfizer Study 43,931 Participants Minority Participants 10% African American 13% Hispanic 6% Asian Only 1 severe reaction 2 doses 21 days apart mRNA Vaccine Moderna Study 30,000 Participants Minority Participants 10.2% African American 20% Hispanic 4.6% Asian Only 1 severe reaction 2 doses 28 days apart mRNA Vaccine Johnson & Johnson Study 43,783 Participants Minority Participants 13% African American 15% Hispanic 6% Asian 1% Native American No reports of severe reaction found Single dose Viral Vector Vaccine 3 How Does mRNA Work? Teaches the body to protect itself from the COVID -19 Virus. Messenger RNA Technology is used to build the antibodies against the Virus. This technology is already used for some newer chemotherapy medication that are used to fight cancer. Ebola Vaccine uses similar technology. How Did It Get Approved So Quickly? The federal government gave drug companies billions of dollars to devote their time to develop COVID -19 vaccines. This allowed companies to pay more scientists to work on the project. The messenger RNA technology allows for faster development of a vaccine than older vaccines that took years to develop. To get Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA, no safety steps are skipped and the companies still had to test the vaccines on thousands of people and track side effects for 8 weeks. 4 What Should I Expect After Getting The Vac- cine? You may have shot -term side effects that are similar to the flu vaccine: Headache Pain at Injection Site Tiredness Muscle Pain Fever These are signs that you body's immune system is working to build the antibodies against COVID -19. How Long Does It Take To Work? The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines show increased effectiveness if you take a 2nd shot 3 -4 weeks after the first one. You will receive maximum benefit from the vaccine about 2 weeks after receiving the 2nd shot. The FDA expects to approve some additional COVID -19 vaccines that will only require 1 shot. You will receive maximum benefit from those vaccines about 2 weeks after receiving the shot. I Had CoVid Do I Still Need The Vaccine? Yes, some people have been sick with COVID -19 more than once so everyone should receive the vaccine. 5 How Long Will It Last? At this time it is unknown but it is possible that COVID -19 vac- cines may need to be given annually, similar to the Flu vaccine. Long Term Effects Of COVID -19 Virus Difficulty with thinking and concentration (sometimes referred to as \"brain fog\") Depression Muscle pain Headache Intermittent fever Fast -beating or pounding heart (also known as heart palpita- tions) Cardiovascular: inflammation of the heart muscle Respiratory: lung function abnormalities Renal: acute kidney injury Dermatologic: rash, hair loss Neurological: smell and taste problems, sleep issues, difficulty with concentration, memory problems Psychiatric: depression, anxiety, changes in mood Long Term Effects Of Vaccine Researches do not have this answer at this time but it is being monitored. So far no serious long term effects have been reported compared to the COVID -19 Virus. 6 Sources: CDC. (2021).
