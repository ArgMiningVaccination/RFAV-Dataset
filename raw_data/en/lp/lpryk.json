When I was 14, I had shingles. (Ew, I know, right?) I remember the dermatologist almost brushed it off as eczema until I complained that the area where I had the rash\u2014my back\u2014was also in an immense amount of pain. While it was rare that I had the disease at such a young age, the derm diagnosed me with shingles and sent me along my way with some powdered medicine and pills. Flash forward two weeks and the pain wasn't gone. At the behest of my hippie parents (Hi, Mom and Dad!), I visited an acupuncturist whom my parents had been seeing for chronic back pain. I was cured in two f**king sessions. Two. Needless to say, I've been a believer ever since. But as a curious health writer more than a decade later, I can't help but wonder what the science behind [acupuncture](http://www.self.com/tag/acupuncture/?mbid=synd_allure) really is. Proponents of acupuncture say it's pretty much the best thing since way before sliced bread. So if you go way back, acupuncture is part of traditional Chinese medicine, and is based on the idea that health is governed by the flow of energy (called qi) throughout the body along pathways called meridians. Illness occurs when this energy flow is disrupted or becomes unbalanced, according to Ashley Flores, a licensed acupuncturist of [Four Flower Wellness](http://fourflowerswellness.com/) in Chicago. Precise insertion of acupuncture needles is said to restore the flow of qi and improve health\u2014and if you ask Flores, the litany of ailments that acupuncture can cure is long. \"The Cochrane library, which has some of the most stringent analyses of the available data, finds acupuncture as effective [treatment] for fibromyalgia, migraine headaches, neck pain, and many other conditions,\" Flores tells SELF. \"Additionally, the World Health Organization has found it to be effective for ailments including hypertension, dysmenorrhea and even dysentery,\" she says. Seems like MaGiC, right? But those who don't buy into it say it's pure hooey. When I talked to Stuart Spitalnic, an emergency physician trained at Brown University who still practices in Rhode Island, he had a completely different take. He basically calls acupuncture BS and says you could get the same effects by giving patients a box of Milk Duds. \"No one can prove that acupuncture does nothing\u2014the burden of proof is on the acupuncture fans to show evidence,\" Spitalnic tells SELF, chalking its benefits up to the placebo effect. \"I do not doubt that acupuncture can be very relaxing and intimate, and that these are features of a great placebo.\" So, does it do anything, or not? More confused than ever about my shingles and needling obsession, I employed the expertise of someone who believes in incorporating both Eastern and Western medicinal practices. Scott Weiss, a doctor of physical therapy and exercise physiologist, works with acupuncturists at his Manhattan sports medicine clinic, [Bodhizone.](http://www.bodhizone.com/) Weiss sums up the body of evidence best when it comes to Western medicine's reliance on acupuncture: \"Acupuncture is highly effective form of therapy that can be used to treat a wide variety of conditions,\" he tells SELF. \"While extensive research in the field has confirmed that acupuncture helps with multiple ailments, there are still many effects that have not, or cannot be corroborated.\" Specifically, many factors\u2014like expectation and belief\u2014that are unrelated to needling may play important roles in the beneficial effects of acupuncture. OK, some people say it doesn't do anything, while others totally swear by it. And even if it isn't effective in and of itself, faith and the placebo effect might be enough to make you feel better anyway. Is it worth trying, then? As long as you go to a licensed acupuncturist \"practicing in a safe, sterile environment,\" Weiss says, there aren't many downsides to letting a stranger stick a bunch of needles in your skin\u2014and plenty of good arguments for submitting to the sticking. As far as the hard science goes, here are nine ways acupuncture could work for you: 1. It could help you manage your weight. In 2003, the [International Journal of Obesity](http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v27/n4/full/0802254a.html) stepped back and took a look at the body of evidence regarding the use of acupuncture to help lose weight. The results, they found, were mixed at best. Some research found that yes, treatment (specifically, when needling the ear) did help patients lose weight\u2014but often in conjunction with traditional weight-loss methods, like exercise and a clean diet. Alternatively, some research found that it was merely the mental effect of acupuncture (more on your mood and needles below) which caused patients to feel better and thus lose weight. And because so much of the research the review covered was uncontrolled for, the jury's still out. But it can't hurt, says Weiss. Just don't rely on it alone, he says\u2014a balanced diet and exercise are the [true essentials](http://www.self.com/wellness/2016/01/healthiest-way-lose-weight-keep-it-off/?mbid=synd_allure) here. 2. It improves sleep quality and reduces insomnia. As a sleep-obsessed individual (I mean, [look what happens to your body when you lose sleep](http://www.self.com/wellness/2016/03/this-is-what-actually-happens-to-your-body-when-you-dont-get-enough-sleep/?mbid=synd_allure)), I'm a big proponent of the relaxing effects of acupuncture and can personally attest to drooling and falling asleep during a session as well as conking out immediately after getting home. Research backs me up: In a [systematized review of 41 trials,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3156618/) acupuncture was shown to relieve insomnia just as effectively as Western medical treatments (think: Ambien). And as someone who has taken Ambien and done acupuncture, I can attest to the fact that both will help you snooze, but acupuncture works every time. (Also: You won't end up a stumbling mess on a cross-country flight after taking said Ambien, but I digress.) 3. It can relieve lower back pain, especially in the long run. In 2005, a [study published](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16095547) in Health Technology Assessment confirmed that for any type of non-specific lower-back pain (that is, not because of a herniated disc or other diagnosable problem), not only did acupuncture relieve just as much pain as traditional primary doctor treatment did in a one-year window, but after two years, acupuncture was a far more effective means of pain reduction. 4. It can [strengthen your immune system.](http://www.self.com/wellness/2016/02/7-proven-ways-to-avoid-getting-sick-this-winter/?mbid=synd_allure) I know this sounds insane, but there is a correlation that's been shown linking acupuncture with heightened production of NK (natural killer) immune cells (best name ever, right?). [This association was especially strong as it relates to cancer,](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2011/481625/) as published in Evidence Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine. \"The triggering of specific nerve points has been shown in several studies to increase the number of NK Cells in the body,\" says Weiss, and is becoming an exciting new way to help build up immunodeficiencies in a variety of patients. 5. It can regulate migraine pain. In 2003, [research found](http://peoriaintegrativewomenshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Migraine-headache.pdf) that acupuncture was just as effective as the well-known prescription drug Imitrex in treating migraines\u2014which is pretty amazing, don't you think? Additionally, another study published that same year confirmed that regular acupuncture was effective in preventing nearly 50 percent of [migraines.](http://www.self.com/wellness/2016/03/the-7-most-common-migraine-triggers/?mbid=synd_allure) \"Of all of acupuncture's benefits, I feel that treating migraines and headaches is one of the best,\" Weiss tells SELF. \"Studies found that the activation of the specific pressure points done during an acupuncture session work as a vasodilator, opening up the blood vessels to increase blood flow throughout the body. This dilation helps relieve the blood flow change in the brain, which is what is considered to be the root cause of various headaches and migraines.\" 6. It can help soothe heartburn. If you suffer chronically from the esophageal pain that feels like death, it's probably worth giving the needles a try. A [study published](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2007.03520.x/abstract) in 2007 confirmed that acupuncture helped improve heartburn more than medicine did on its own, suggesting that the two therapies in tandem work best. 7. And relieve allergies. A 2013 [research study published](http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1583578) in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine found that needling not only helps with pain, like the lower-back kind, but can also help relieve [allergy symptoms such as itching and sneezing.](http://www.self.com/wellness/2016/04/how-to-tell-if-you-have-a-cold-or-allergies/?mbid=synd_allure) However, like the heartburn research, this was found to be true in groups who were also medicating themselves with antihistamines. Weiss tells SELF that this claim has extremely limited evidence, though, and can likely be chalked up to the good-old \"placebo effect.\" 8. It can help you quit smoking. As someone who (thank the lord) [quit cold turkey](http://www.self.com/wellness/2016/04/7-things-that-can-make-it-easier-to-quit-smoking-cold-turkey/?mbid=synd_allure) over seven years ago, I can't really speak to this one. But the journal of Preventative Medicine can: [Their research found](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743501909016) not only was acupuncture effective for smoking cessation in an eight-month period, but it also had a lasting effect when the authors checked in with the subjects five years later. Which is enough time, according to the American Heart Association, for smokers to cut their risk of heart attack in HALF. Major. 9. Acupuncture can boost your mood (which might actually be at the root of all its seemingly magical abilities). Think of this point as one of the central theses of acupuncture: When needles are placed at trigger points, they release serotonin, the neurotransmitter responsible for making you happy. And when these endorphins are released, they can help not only [boost your mood,](http://www.self.com/wellness/psych/2015/12/13-things-you-can-do-to-improve-your-mood-in-30-seconds-or-less/?mbid=synd_allure) but alleviate pain, help you relax and the like\u2014which could explain pretty much this entire list to a degree, says Weiss. Whether or not you have a higher health purpose in mind, he notes that the wellness community in general sees acupuncture as a means to feel good, fast\u2014without any chemicals. The bottom line: TBH, the evidence is mixed. Some doctors will dismiss acupuncture completely. Acupuncturists swear by it. Some clinical studies back it up; some doctors do, too. Plus, not only do many healthcare providers now cover the service, but it also has not been found to be dangerous in any way. So if it's something you've been thinking about, it's safe to give it a try. And I swear the needles are hair-thin. It doesn't even feel like a pinprick, promise. But after doing all this research, I'm a bit skeptical on how it actually works. Then again, if I'm so chilled out that I'm drooling on the table by the end, I guess that's not really a bad thing. Because if nothing else, as Elle Woods says, endorphins make people happy. \u2014 Written by Rachel Jacoby Zoldan Related Links: [6 Stretches To Relieve A Tight, Sore Neck](http://www.self.com/fitness/2015/02/stretches-relieve-sore-neck-sitting-all-day/?mbid=synd_allure) [11 Bad Beauty Habits to Break ASAP](http://www.self.com/beauty/2016/01/bad-beauty-habits-to-break-asap/?mbid=synd_allure) [I Tried At-Home Microneedling And It Totally Changed My Skin](http://www.self.com/beauty-style/2016/05/what-is-microneedling/?mbid=synd_allure) Can Cosmetic Acupuncture Make You "}
