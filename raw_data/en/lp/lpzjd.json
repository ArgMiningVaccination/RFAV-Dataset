Harry F. Byrd Jr. (Ind.-Va .), who offered the balanced-budget amendment, ex\u00ad plained in a two-minute statement that he was simply fulfilling one of President Car\u00ad ter's campaign promises . His brief remarks made up the entire debate; not one other senator commented on the proposal. The amendment passed, 58 to 28, with Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and George McGovern (D-S.D.) among the liberals in opposition . The bill itself then sailed through, 69 to 16. Next, when the House appointed conferees to meet with their Senate counterparts to reconcile the different versions of the IMF bill, Rep. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) moved that the House conferees be in\u00ad structed to accept the balanced-budget amendment . The House debate was more ex\u00ad tensive than the Senate monologue , but few speakers discussed the merits of the idea, and no one explained how the amendment was supposed to work. Several congressmen feared that they were voting on a balanced budget in 1981 without having studied it. Rep. Henry S. Reuss (D-Wis.), pointing out that committee hearings had never been held on the proposal, con\u00ad fessed: \"The truth of the matter is that we do not know beans about the niceties of the budget.\" The House then voted overwhelming approval of the balanced-budget require\u00ad ment. Many of those voting in favor said that they wanted to go on record in support of a balanced budget without actually requiring one. The amendment, they said, could easily be superseded by the action of a later Con\u00ad gress. And so, within a month the IMF bill was signed into law, amendment in tow. Now, five months later, people are begin\u00ad ning to ask what the law means. According to Byrd, it means that the President \"will have an obligation to submit a balanced budget to the Congress for 1981.\" It could also mean that regardless of what the Presi\u00ad dent submits, Congress is obligated to turn down appropriations that exceed receipts for 1981. A Congressional Research Service memo on the amendment 's legal et!ect suggests a third possibility: The President may have to spend less than Congress appropriates, if that's what is necessary to balance the budg-et. Of course, if the President impounds appropriated funds (even to balance the budget) he may violate the Congressional Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (passed in reaction to the Nixon administration's refusal to spend funds that Congress had appropriated) . In addition to confusion over who is sup\u00ad posed to do what under the balanced-budget law, there is puzzlement over how it is to be enforced. Since the law declares simply that outlays shall not exceed receipts, without making anyone in particular responsible, who could be named as a defendant in a lawsuit if the budget weren't balanced? And who would have standing to bring suit? How would any\u00ad one know at what point during fiscal 1981 that outlays exceeded receipts? Would the courts even consider the balanced-budget requirement a justiciable issue? Most likely the judiciary would find the law to be hor\u00ad tatory, without any binding effect at all. At least one statement made in Congress about the balanced-budget requirement seems accurate: \". . . many efforts will be made to set aside, ignore or evade\" it.e SENATE~-Wednesday, March 28, 1979 <Legislative day of Thursday, February 22. 1979) The Senate met at 11: 45 a.m., on the expiration of the recess, and was called to order by Hon.

APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESI\u00ad DENT PRO TEMPORE The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please read a communication to the Senate from the President pro tempore (Mr. MAGNUSON) . The assistant legislative clerk read the following letter: U.S. SENATE, PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE, Washington, D.C., March 28, 1979. To the Senate: Under the provisions of rule I, section 3, of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby appoint the Honorable MAx BAucus, a Senator from the State of Montana, to perform the duties of the Chair. WARREN G. MAGNUSON, President pro tempore. Mr. BAUCUS thereupon assumed the chair as Acting President pro tempore. RECOGNITION OF LEADERSHIP The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. Under the previous order, the ma\u00ad jority leader is recognized. THE JOURNAL Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Journal of the proceedings be approved to date. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I have no requests for my time, so if the distinguished minority leader wishes to proceed, I shall reserve my time for the moment. RECOGNITION OF LEADERSIDP The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. Under the previous order, the mi\u00ad nority leader is recognized. A PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, the banner story in this morning's Washington Post reported that the United States has made certain pledges of economic, political, and military assistance to Israel in the event Egypt violates the terms of the peace treaty signed in Washington on Monday. This treaty has been cause for consid\u00ad erable celebration this week, and I have been among those commending the prin\u00ad cipals in these negotiations for their ini\u00ad tiative and commitment. The vast majority of my colleagues in the Senate, I believe, wish to be faithful partners in the continuing Middle East peace process. The security and success of that part\u00ad nership rests heavily on the willingness of the administration to take the Con\u00ad gress and its leadership into the admin\u00ad istration's confidence, to solicit our coun\u00ad sel as well as our consent, to let us know precisely the nature and extent of the agreements being made with our friends in Israel and in Egypt. President Carter gave us a brief sum\u00ad mary of the proposed U.S. economic as\u00ad sistance package associated with this treaty in a briefing at the White House on Monday following the signing cere\u00ad mony. But the pJedges of military assistance outlined in the Post this morning, includ\u00ad ing the possibility of direct U.S. naval action to break a sea blockade and other such military interventions, were news to me. We are taking steps into the unknown in these momentous days, Mr. President, and we all want to play as constructive a role as possible within the limits of prudent policy. I simply urge the administration to be very sure it gives the Congress the oppor\u00ad tunity we genuinely seek to be a full\u00ad and fully informed-ally in the waging of peace. JAY SOLOMON Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, I am de\u00ad lighted to join my distinguished fellow This \"bullet\" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by the Member on the floor. March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 6519 Senator from Tennessee in sponsoring a resolution of appreciation for the out\u00ad standing work which Jay Solomon has done in the past 2 years as head of the General Services Administration. It is distressing and disturbing, Mr. President, to see a good man like Jay Solomon being forced out of the Fed\u00ad eral Government, apparently for doing his job too well. Mr. Solomon was given the difficult task of rooting out corruption at the scandal-ridden GSA. His success in that effort is convincingly demonstrated by the more than 40 indictments and some 30 guilty pleas which are the product of the GSA investigation to date. I have risen to Jay Solomon's defense several times in the course of this in\u00ad vestigation, Mr. President, and that de\u00ad fense has always been against the charge that he was too conscientious in ful\u00ad filling his mandate. I have also risen to his defense when he declined to play the age-old politics of cronyism in Washington, only to be undercut by an administration which had campaigned so ardently against \"politics as usual\" in 1976. Now Jay Solomon is taking his leave of Washington and returning to his home, his family, and his business enter\u00ad prises in Tennessee. He takes with him the appreciation of the Senate, and it is most unfortunate that he takes with him a substantial measure of this administration's credi\u00ad bility as well. Mr. President, I have no further re\u00ad quirement for my time. I yield back my time remaining under the standing order. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield back my time also. ROUTINE MORNING BUSINESS The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. Under the previous order, there will now be a period for the transaction of routine morning business of not to exceed 15 minutes, with statements therein limited to 5 minutes each. Is there morning busines? TRIBUTE TO B. E. BENSINGER Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, since the death of B. E. Bensinger, almost 2 months ago, the business and civic community and our Nation as a whole lost a valuable friend. Ted Bensinger lived life to its !fullest, and gave everything he had to all of his endeavors, which included hunting and fishing, various civic activities, and family life. He was largely responsible for making Brunswick Corp. a Fortune 500 company. No one capsulized his outstanding ca\u00ad reer and the characteristics he brought to everything he touched better than Rabbi Herbert Bronstein of the North Shore Congregation Israel in Glencoe, Ill., during the memorial service. His words deeply moved all of us privileged to hear him and who had been honored to share a part of Ted Bensinger's excit\u00ad ing and meaningful life. I ask unanimous consent to have Rabbi Bronstein's eulogy printed in the RECORD. There being .no objection, the eulogy was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: IN MEMORIAM: B. E. BENSINGER (By Rabbi Herbert Bronstein) To begin, I would like to share with you, friends, a poem selected by Ted Bensinger's children, written by Rudyard Kipling, a poet that he loved, and from whose works he read often to the children as they were growing up. If you can dream--a.nd not make dreams your master; If yo'.l can think-and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with triumph and disaster And treat those two imposters just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools; If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the will which says to them: Hold on! I could not help but think, sitting in the Bensinger home, a place over the years so brimful of festivity and the joys of life, and yesterday again full of family, the chil\u00ad dren, some of their friends, the grandchil\u00ad dren, I could not help but think how very much Ted Bensinger would have enjoyed to the fullest yesterday afternoon simply being with everyone there; how he would have loved to watch the Super Bowl with them, punctuating the action now and then with some well wrought and totally original com\u00ad ment of his own, now and then an especial\u00ad ly rich and sometimes pungent turn of phrase; an afternoon he would have all the more enjoyed if he had organized the gath\u00ad ering himself to the last detail, from the transportation that would have brought the members of the family together from dis\u00ad tant parts, down to the refreshments them\u00ad selves, leaving nothing else for anyone else to do, but enjoy themselves. And then, in the course of the afternoon, he might have taken now this grandchild aside to talk about how things were going at his beloved Yale and with the football team (and what it must have meant to him to have had a grandson at Yale on the football team); to another grandchild whom he had been bombarding daily with the Yale Daily News as to why he should go to Yale; to a third in whom he might perceive some important juncture in life, a decision to be made, ex\u00ad pressing his own views forthrightly, but not in an overbearing manner, perhaps even beginning by putting himself down a bit with a salacious comment, wisely, in order to get a hearing; and in each instance call\u00ad ing each of them by a distinctive nickname which he himself had coined years ago and which, like so many other things that Ted Bensinger did, stuck. And during that whole day, I imagine, that charming smile and gracious manner, which, throughout the years since his own youth, had given such a lustre to so many such gatherings, would have fairly shone from him. And if friends were there, with whom he, with Linda, could share the pleasure, that would have given him the supreme joy itself. All of us gathered here, all of us assembled for this memorial service, come with a sense of respect for B. E. Bensinger. Many of you, I know, have come with real affection for him; and some are here with feelings of deep and abiding love. But all of us know that we are paying tribute to a marvelously unique person of significant accomplishment, a hu\u00ad man being who had an effect, as upon me, as I learned of him more and more in these last few days, had an effect as an example, and even as an inspiration, upon anyone whose life his own life touched. That example and significance begins even with what I perceive was the outward circle of his being, that is, the public life, notable in that while we pay a deserved tribute to those who by focus of singleminded atten\u00ad tion upon only one endeavor are able to suc\u00ad ceed in but a single field, how much the more notable with him, in that however wide\u00ad spread and varied were his interests, some\u00ad how each showed in accomplishment, in ef\u00ad fect, quality and depth, the mark of ex\u00ad cellence. As his own sons have written: He meant a lot to many people in different ways and at different times. He was an in\u00ad spiring leader for Brunswick, for Michael Reese Hospital, for the Boy Scouts, for sal\u00ad mon conservation, for his family, his friends, his community. He experimented and he studied; he learned and he read; and he watched and he listened; and whether it was learning to fly an airplane (which he did) or to speak four languages (which he spoke) or to teach the difference between a. grilse and a salmon (which his expression revealed while one was on the line), he gained a level of expertise achieved by few. Therefore, his leadership was sought. He made people not only feel important, but he inspired them to contribute significantly. He simply brought out the best in people, and he had the vision and ability to make it count. Whether Ted was talking with his associates about planning the development of the au\u00ad tomatic pinsetter, helping to organize a. building fund drive for the hospital, or cam\u00ad paigning for a civic philanthropic contribu\u00ad tion, or traveling with his family, he not only did his homework, but he got the job done.\" And again, I quote: \"Ted Bensinger changed the world he lived in. He changed the business he was involved with, Brunswick. He made it an important diversified, respected institution. He was among those who changed Michael Reese Hospital and developed it into a great medical institution, after serving the hos\u00ad pital for years. He founded the first chair for Slavic languages and Russian studies, and we all know how important the understand\u00ad ing of this culture is in our lives and in that of our children. He changed the direction and the capacity of the Gastro-Intestinal Research Foundation so that more under\u00ad standing and research could take place about the human body. He changed the rules and regulations that control the environment, as head of the Atlantic Salmon Foundation. He changed the activities of so many civic or\u00ad ganizations-the University of Chicago, the Jewish Federation, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Lyric Opera, Field Museum, etc., etc., etc. He changed the English language, for all of us know of his totally individual way of speaking.\" \"Ted Bensinger\"-! quote-\"dld make a difference.\" So, only with the beginning of the achieve\u00ad ment in the complex articulation and phe\u00ad nomenal growth of a commercial enterprise about which another businessman wrote that \"a Harvard business professor could do a study of paths not taken and expertise in hindsight, but the work of which he, Ted Bensinger, actually accomplished;\" to the numerous committees and the extensive phi\u00ad lanthropies and the variety of personal in\u00ad terests; to his incredible capacity, to use his son's words, \"to attend wtih equal concen-6520 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE March 28, 1979 tra.tion to ea.ch person with whom he was;\" to acts of simple, direct generosity , good counsel, all with effort, attention, focus, concentra. tion. Of such a person surely it behooves us to inquire after the sources in his being that ma.de for such a fullness and completion that one can say of him, as Scripture of the pa\u00ad triarch, with such simple force, \"he lived!\" What were those sources? First, certainly, a marvelous combination of innate, God-given intelligence, energy, dynamism, will, revealed in his mastery of detail, as well as his grasp of general prin\u00ad ciples, whether in the field of automation, biological research, not only the lore of fish\u00ad ing, which he so loved, but from this to the science of icthyology, from the raising and training of hunting dogs, his acquisition of languages, fields in medicine-yes , even-to the knowledge voluminously recorded day by day, as he studied the illness which struck him down, followed and understood by him with the same acumen, step by step at every turn of the process. When he ca.me to the leader\u00ad ship of a great institution , Michael Reese Hospital , it was only after he had served and mastered, humbly, the work of every single committee. And if he could bring the work of such an effort of what many of you call GIRF-Ga.stro-Intestina.l Research Founda\u00ad tion-and its professional leadership to the height of an excellence unequalled anywhere, it was because he himself insisted first on be\u00ad ing thoroughly informed; and unlike some others whose motto may be \"the best\" with\u00ad out the substance of its reality, he went after the best and achieved it. But I have come to understand that hi& was a more encompassing, even visionary in\u00ad telligence that transcended the realm of de\u00ad tail and fa.ct a.lone, as important as these are. The success of Brunswick was based, not only as in all of this endeavor upon the astute choice of personnel and delegation of respon\u00ad sib111ty, at which he was very good, but also upon an astute analysis of changes in Amer\u00ad ican society and its culture, and therefore its leisure patterns, which earlier than many others he perceived. But as much as these innate gifts, I be\u00ad lieve that the wholeness and richness and fullness of his life flowed from his very love of life. From youth throughout his days, for him \"life piled on life,\" in the words of the poet, \"were all too little.\" And even at the end he said to a confidant: \"I know very well what the final score is going to be. All I want is a few more innings!\" Like many others, he was born into the means on which he could build to enjoy a good life; but like very few, as one has said quite truly, very few, he actu\u00ad ally did enjoy his life-from the crew parties on Derby Day, which he himself organized at college, always wanting even at those parties the best and the la test, to the Sunday brunches at his home, to the world travel, the active sports he so loved, yes, even at the endless benefits, which we have to accept as an obligation, his smile and his elegant cha.rm always enkindled the occasion. Humor effervesced from him as bubbles from a fine champagne. And the places of their dwelling, Linda and Ted-here , in Jamaica., the lodge in New Brunswick, above all 945 Dean Avenue-\u00ad were always houses of life. His days were, like the collage fashioned by grandchildren now above the mantel in the dining room, a collage of the finest enjoyments life can afford. But, above all, for those closest to him, this love of life was expressed in nothing else so much as in his profound love of nature, the field, the stream, nature in its every varying abundance, its largesse , which he prized; and nowhere so happy in nature as at the Restigouche, Two Brooks, that love of na. ture which he passed on to his sons and endeavored-and that was his final expres\u00ad sion of the love of life, which he endeavored with such success to pass on to grandchil\u00ad dren, as well. AbiUty, the love of life, and certainly to complement his achievement in enterprise, another source of the fullness of his life was his civic spirit. I cannot help but think that that came from traditions in his family, an ideal passed on by our generations, the mo\u00ad tive of community service, the sense of no\u00ad blesse, of obligation , which is the best pa.rt of our most successful people. And, as his father and mother must have passed this on to him, so this, as in so many aspects of their shared spirit, with Linda, the principle of communal service he passed on to his children , which is manifest in certain as\u00ad pects of the engagement of their lives and work, and which one can already perceive in the spirit of his grandchildren, as well. And to these we must add an ever deeper element in his spirit-the element of cour\u00ad age. He was a man who actually was ener\u00ad gized by challenge; and the greater the chal\u00ad lenge, the greater the response in the power of his determination \"to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\" Whether it was find\u00ad ing a conveyance , as one dear friend remem\u00ad bers, on a trip in a field to cross a river in the middle of the night; whether transform\u00ad ing the operation of a tremendously complex institution , whether even to face up to and comprehend and battle a dread disease be\u00ad yond the power yet of any hand to stay-yes, even to stay itself \"the hand of the Fell Sergeant, Dea.th, so strict in his arrest.\" His children knew, remember, and have written of this example of courage: \"For him,\" they say, \"there was always a way somehow! Over many a mountain that would have turned others back-in fa.ct, most would not have attempted to sea.le the peaks he climbed.\" \"Our world,\" they have written, in tribute to him, \"is a mixed bag of cyni\u00ad cism and change; it tests the human spirit to the limit. Ted rose to the task time and time a.gain, and at the end fought as relent\u00ad less and as painful a battle as life can pose.\" I believe that if, as some have told me, he believed in the free entrepreneurial spirit of the 19th century , it was because at the heart of that ideal is individual courage to take a risk, the courage to venture and to take the responsibility , a spirit whose diminution in our own time was one of his few laments . He accepted life's reverses and pains, even his illness, with unusual grace, a grace which is dowered, friends, only by courage. But, finally, at the heart of the man, I be\u00ad lieve beyond the innate gifts, the love of life, the community spirit, the courage, one more element remains to explain how of him we can say with the greatest of all poets, whom he loved-Shakespeare--\"His life was gentle, and the elements so mixed in him that Na\u00ad ture might stand up and say to all the world, 'This was a man.' \" Yes, that was it. That element I believe at his heart was an unusual generosity of spirit, an inward gentleness, the ability to give, to love. And that ability to give explains why one who had no need to do so could, with Linda, give such endless weary hours to the mere details, and, yes, necessary amenities of philanthropic life, why he took significant entrepreneurial risks for the very purpose of enlarging his philanthropies-a. rarity, in\u00ad deed. And I think that true generosity of spirit explains how his worthy name is as\u00ad sociated at the hospital to which he gave so much of his very being-Michael Reese, which bears the stamp of his spirit as much as that of any man-how his name a.nd philanthropy is assoch.ted with the service building, as totally necessary to healing as such a structure is totally unglamorous; and why he saw, whether it was cost-effective or not, that a hospital should have a park in addition to the technical facilities, should have the ambience of the human, the humane. To his committee work, as one testifies who knows this well as any, he brought forceful-ness, yes, but a constant geniality. And, as an early employee wrote to him only recent\u00ad ly-a man who indicated that by Ted Ben\u00ad singer's example he rose to be the head of his own corporation- \"! believe that you did more than the usual along these lines. Those employee picnics at your house in Highland Park were a graceful thing to do, and I sus\u00ad pect sometimes painful. A few excessive drinkers, excessive familiarity, intrusion of your house and grounds. But it was the bring\u00ad ing of some humanness into the corporate equation.\" And it was the same spirit of generosity which showed in his keeping of a diary of the birthdays and notable days of family and friends, and his remarkable mental rec\u00ad ord of what each person liked and where they wanted to sit and what they liked to do. That generosity was in the Kipling stories and poems he loved to read at bedtime to his sons, the immense a.mount of time he gave to them, as later to his grandchildren. But in nothing was that love of life and that life of love so fulfilled as with his life companionship with you, Linda., the wife of his youth; and in your life together until only recent times enthusiasm in shared giv\u00ad ing, in sharing perception, in shared ideals, a life together that was kind of eternal youth. For everyone in the community the pass\u00ad ing of such a man as Ted Bensinger is a tremendous loss. To such a man how hard it is for you who loved him, how hard it is for you to bid farewell. And yet, you can think of him as I do now, standing at the confluence of rivers in some eternal Restigouche, savoring in the breeze of a sun forever shining, a sky without hori\u00ad zon, and in the midst of the flow of endless life about him, there, perhaps, in his mind echo the words of Kipling's nature night song, which he used to love to recite to his sons when they were little: O hush thee, my son, the night is behind us And black are the waters that sparkled so green. The moon, o'er the combers, looks downward to find us At rest in the hollows that rustle between. Where billow meets billow, then soft by thy pillow Ah, weary wee fiippel'lling, curl at thy ease! The storm shall not wake thee, nor shark overtake thee. Asleep in the arms of the slow swinging seas. STANDBY GASOLINE RATIONING PLAN Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I have a short statement that relates to gasoline rationing as proposed by the President. I am very proud to have my name addled as a cosponsor to Senate Resolu\u00ad tion 98, which was introduced on March 13 by our distinguished colleague from Texas, Senator BENTSEN. This resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that the President should withdraw and amend the standby gasoline rationing plan which he presented to the Senate earlier this month. I strongly object to the proposed plan, because it is grossly unfair to Arkansas and other States which are similar in their demographic and economic nature. The President's plan would place an un\u00ad bearable burden on these rural States like ours under rationing conditions. This is because it fails to take into ac\u00ad count the very particular needs of each State, based on per capita fuel conswnp\u00ad tion figures. Instead, the plan would allocate gaso\u00ad line by national average gasoline con\u00ad sumption rates. There is no allowance for March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 6521 the fact that the citizens of some States-like Arkansas-simply must rely on the private vehicle to a greater degree than citizens of other States who might have the benefit of mass transit or public transportation. It distresses me that our State would be almost uniquely impacted under the President's plan. I was shocked when I saw the :figures. With a 15-percent gas curtailment, Pennsylvania for example, would receive 7 percent more gasoline than it used in 1976 while the State of Arkansas would receive only 71.6 per\u00ad cent of its 1976 consumption level. This is the most extreme example of inequity. Assuming a plan based on a 25-percent reduction in gasoline supplies, the States of Hawaii, Pennsylvania, North Dakota, and Rhode Island would receive coupons for more than 90 percent of each State's normal supplies. On the other hand, Mis\u00ad souri, South Carolina, West Virginia, and Texas would receive an average of 6f percent of their normal supplies. In short, the plan fails to reflect the historical differences in per vehicle con\u00ad sumption levels among the States. In a resolution passed by the Arkansa \u00b7 General Assembly on March 1, the gen\u00ad eral assembly expressed its belief that Arkansas' dependence on the automobile, its rural character and historic usage patterns should be considered if gas ra\u00ad tioning plans are, in fact, to be devel\u00ad oped. In joining Senate Resolution 98. I ask for the same considerations. Also, the so-called \"white market\" al\u00ad lowed under the plan is no solution to our dilemma. In fact, in my opinion, it is a disaster. Not only would it be a night\u00ad mare administratively, it, too, is unfair to the States which would be under-allo\u00ad cated. The \"white market\" allows these States to purchase additional coupons from citizens in other States. I might add that there is no limit on the price that these coupons could bring. The re\u00ad sult would be an enormous income-trans\u00ad fer from one State to another. The Arkansas legislature noted in its resolution that it could cost the citizens of Arkansas an additional $6 million per month to buy additional allotments on the \"white market\" due to the failure of the rationing plan to contain State ad\u00ad justment factors. This situation should not be allowed. Arkansas is almost at the bottom of the list in per capita income as it is. It is wrong to sanction a situa\u00ad tion where States like Arkansas would be required to pay out large sums of money to States who have a much higher per capita income. As my distinguished colleague from Texas, Senator BENTSEN, pointed out, seven States including Arkansas with an average per capita income of $5,816 would account for 70 percent of the in\u00ad come lost to the \"white market.\" Seven States with a per capita income of $7,522 would account for approximately the same percentage of income gained. Why allow such a situation to exist when it could be solved by basing State alloca\u00ad tions on historical needs? I would like to stress to my colleagues that Arkansans do not waste gasoline any more than other American con\u00ad sumers. But the very nature of living and work\u00ad ing in a State like the one I have the honor to represent, in this day and age, requires a heavy reliance on the private vehicle. Imagine the situation where a mother in Nashville, Ark., needed to take her child to an orthodontist or a pedia\u00ad trician. The nearest one she could find would be in Texarkana, 60 miles away. Countless examples-and more extreme ones, I am sure--involving small cities all over the State could be cited. After all, Arkansas has only four cities of over 50,000 population. These cities are the only places, basically, where many goods and services can be obtained. The relatively high per capita percen\u00ad tage of gasoline usage in Arkansas is not frivolous or willful. It is a necessity. Our State could be paralyzed by the President's proposed plan. In addition to the inequities of the gas allocation formula, the President's rationing plan would have a devastating impact on agriculture. Under the pres\u00ad ent allocation program, agriculture is given 100 percent of its current require\u00ad ments for gas and diesel fuel. Under the proposed formula, agriculture would have no meaningful priority. Agricul\u00ad ture is lumped in the same grouping with all other users and would be subject to rationing only \"after the fact\" in a shorts.ge situation. The proposal to al\u00ad locate fuel to agriculture on the com\u00ad plicated national formula which would necessitate a study of fuel usage on a commodity by commodity basis and ulti\u00ad mately on a farm by farm basis is not only unworkable but violates the legis\u00ad lative intent of section 203 of the En\u00ad ergy Policy and Conservation Act which mandates a program which would have precedence to certain classes of users in order of social priority over other classes of users. This rationing plan, as it affects agriculture, is not a workable system. It is the flrst plan in the his\u00ad tory of our country without a meaning\u00ad ful agricultural priority. The large number of letters I receive daily from citizens who are concerned about the energy crisis prove to me that Arkansans are willing and eager to con\u00ad serve gasoline to the extent that they can. However, they also point out the pitiful lack of alternatives available to them. Mr. President, Arkansas has no Metro system. If Arkansans are to go about their daily business, they must be assured of an adequate supply of fuel. I agree with my distinguished col\u00ad league from Texas that this plan is totally unjust and unacceptable. I am prepared to join with him to do every\u00ad thing I can to defeat it. I am not asking for any special treatment for my State. Rather, I feel that it is our responsibil\u00ad ity to insure that any legislation we approve treats citizens equally. This is especially so in a crisis situation. If the hardship arises, we should shoulder it together, on an equal basis. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the resolution passed by the Arkansas Legislature be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the resolu\u00ad tion was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 4 Whereas, the Department of Energy is cur\u00ad rently considering a gasoline rationing con\u00ad tingency plan for submission to the Congress for approval; and Whereas, that plan, at the present time, fails to refiect historical differences in per vehicle consumption levels among the states; and Whereas, it could cost the citizens of Ar\u00ad kansas an additional six xnillion dollars ($6,000,000) per month to buy additional al\u00ad lotments on the \"white market\" due to the failure of the rationing plan to contain state adjustment factors; and Whereas, the current proposed plan would also fail to adequately provide for the essen\u00ad tial needs of agriculture in spite of the fact that Section 4(b) (1) of the Emergency Pe\u00ad troleum Allocation Act requires such needs to be met; and Whereas, Arkansas' dependence on the au\u00ad tomobile, its rural character, and historic usage patterns should be considered 1! gas rationing plans are to be developed. Now the:;:efore, Be it resolved by the Senate of the State of Arkansas, the House of Representatives concurring therein; That the Department of Energy is hereby urged to consider revisions in its proposed gasoline rationing contingency plan to more fairly provide for the historic per vehicle con\u00ad sumption rates of the various regions of the country and for the essential needs of agri\u00ad culture and of rural America. Be it further resolved that a copy of this Resolution be sent to the United States De\u00ad partment of Energy and each member of the Arkansas Congressional Delegation. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk pro\u00ad ceeded to call the roll. Mr. HART. Mr. President, I ask unani\u00ad mous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. Without objection, it is so ordered. SENATE RESOLUTION 115-TO MAKE RULE XLIV OF THE STAND\u00ad ING RULES OF THE SENATE EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 2, 1979 Mr. HART. Mr. President, I ask unani- mous consent that it be in order to take up a resolution. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest that the Senator send his res\u00ad olution to the desk, let it be stated by the clerk, and then ask unanimous consent. Mr. HART. Yes. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. The clerk will state the resolution. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Colorado (Mr. HART) !or himself and Mr. RIEGLE, Mr. THURMOND, Mr. EXON, Mr. STONE, Mr. BURDICK , Mr. METZEN\u00ad BAUM, Mr. HEFLIN, and Mr. LEAHY, proposes a resolution (S. Res. 115) as follows: Resolved, That notwithstanding section 313(c) of S. Res. 110, Ninety-fifth Congress, as amended rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, as amended by section 101 of that resolution, shall take effect on January 2, 1979. Mr. HART. Mr. President, I ask unani\u00ad mous consent that it be in order to take up the resolution. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-6522 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE March 28, 1979 pore. Is there objection to the immediate consideration of the resolution? Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object-- The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. The Senator from Alaska. Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would not object if we can get an agreement to vote. This affects my resolution. I have a longstanding personal commitment which requires me to be home tomorrow, so I would like to have a vote today. If my good friend would agree to a time limit so we can vote not later than 4: 30 p.m. today, I have no objection. Mr. HART. It was the intent of the Senator from Colorado to get consent that it be in order to take up the resolu\u00ad tion and then ask unanimous consent for a time agreement of relatively short duration. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. The Chair inquires of the Senator from Colorado whether he intends to in\u00ad troduce a new resolution or whether he is attempting to discharge the commit\u00ad tee from Senate Resolution 97? Mr. HART. The intent is to introduce a new resolution. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. The Chair thanks the Senator from Colorado. Mr. STEVENS. I do not object. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. Is there objection to the immedi\u00ad ate consideration of the resolution? The Chair hears none. Mr. HART. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be a vote-- Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, on this I think the Senator should con\u00ad fer with me on any agreement as to time. Mr. HART. Very well. I will leave it to the leadership. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Will the Sen\u00ad ator discuss it with me so I will know what he has in mind? Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. The clerk will call the roll. The second assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescindecl. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr President, I have discussed the matter with the distinguished Senator from Colorado. There are Senators that I want to be sure are protected. Mr. LEVIN on yester\u00ad day objected to a time agreement which would have permitted a vote yesterday. I wonder if Mr. LEVIN has any obj ec\u00ad tion to a time agreement on this measure today, to a vote on it today. Does the Senator know? Mr. HART. It is my informal under\u00ad standing the Senator from Michigan <Mr. LEVIN) does not intend to offer any amendments. We are double checking that with his office now, but I was informed this morning that he did not intend to offer an amendment. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I thank the Senator. Mr. MORGAN had indicated he might wish to off er an amendment. Does the Senator know anything in this regard? Mr. HART. No, I do not. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I propose that there be a time agree\u00ad ment, and Senators may participate in this before I put the request, which would allow 30 minutes on any amendment, but I think the agreement ought to be in the usual form, because amendments should be germane to this resolution. Aside from that, points of order can be made against any amendment that is not germane, or any amendment to the resolution, unless 1 day's notice has been given. Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield? Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Yes. Mr. STEVENS. The only stipulation I would like to add is the one I put in the RECORD last night, that there was request on this side that if amendments were offered it would be in order to move to table the resolution, and carry with it all amendments, and not have an un\u00ad derstanding there would be automati\u00ad cally an up-or-down vote. We have no objection to an up-and\u00ad down vote on the resolution per se; but if amendments are offered, the only way to take care of all of them at the same time, on one vote, would be to have a motion to table. If the Senator from Colorado would understand that, we would like to have an up-and-down vote on the resolution, but we do not know what amendments would be offered. So I would like that reservation. Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I yield. Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, I know of one amendment on this side that will be offered by the Senator from Con\u00ad necticut <Mr. WEICKER) . Since he is not in the Chamber at this moment, I would like to make sure that nothing in this agreement precludes his opportunity to off er his amendment. Mr. HART. I only want to make this point: The whole purpose of this resolu\u00ad tion is to get an up-and-down vote, pure and simple, on the issue of limitations on earned income. If this resolution is encumbered by all sorts of amendments and we try to start reforming the ethics of the Senate on the floor, using this resolution as a platform, and if we get into a whole series of parliamentary maneuvers-a tabling motion and a lot of other things-we are going to defeat the whole purpose. This is a simple method to get an up-or-down vote on an issue that concerns many people in the Senate and around the country. If we start to reliti\u00ad gate the whole issue of Senate ethics and the question of what income we can earn, and so forth, we probably will be here until summer. So I hope that, on both sides of the aisle, purely and simply, we would get a vote in the next hour on the issue of the limitation upon earned income. Mr. MORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. ROBERT c. BYRD. I yield. Mr. MORGAN. Mr. President, I heard the colloquy on the speaker in my office and immediately left for the Chamber. I missed the agreement. I wonder whether the leader would tell me what the pro\u00ad posed agreement is. Mr. ROBERT c. BYRD. I had not yet made a proposal. I had indicated that the distinguished Senator from North Caro\u00ad lina had indicated yesterday evening that he would have an amendment which he might think about calling up, and I just asked the distinguished Senator from Colorado if he had any information as to what the wishes of the Senator from North Carolina were. So there has been no request as yet. I had suggested that we might have some informal discussions here, or on the record, of a time agreement. I was going to propose that there be a time for de\u00ad bate, equally divided between Mr. HART, as a cosponsor of the resolution, and the distinguished Senator from Alaska, as an opponent of the resolution; that there be, say, 30 minutes to a side for debate and 30 minutes on any amendment, with the understanding that amendments be germane. Otherwise, the resolution does become a lightning rod for all kinds of amendments. However, we really do not need the germaneness provision, because any amendment that is not germane would be open to the point of order that the Senate was not given previous notice. As a matter of fact, I would suppose that any amendment to the resolution would be subject to a point of order, on the basis that the Senate had not had a day's notice. I ask the Chair. I propound it as a parliamentary inquiry. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. Any amendments dealing with the same rule would not be subject to 1 day's ii.otice. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Why should that be? Any change in the rule requires a day's notice, and the Senator from Colorado has given a day's notice of his proposal. If Senator x comes in and seeks to amend that resolution, the Senate has not been given a day's notice of Senator x's proposed change in the rule. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the precedents, amend\u00ad ments thereto are in order. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. They would be in order so long as they are germane to the amendment. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct. If they deal with the same rule. Mr. MORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I yield. Mr. MORGAN. Mr. President, I would be glad to discuss with the Senate my thoughts, which might help us to arrive at some decision. First, I have no desire at all to hinder or to delay a vote on the resolution of the Senator from Colorado. I have stated that had I been here, I would have voted for the resolution in the past. I will vote for it today. I do not know which way it will be proposed. Mr. President, my concern is this: I have served on the Ethics Committee for 2 years now, and I have been honored to March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 6523 serve on it, although I must say, in all candor, that it probably has been the most burdensome undertaking I ever have been involved in, and it appears that I will be involved in it a little while longer. However, I think the matter I am con\u00ad cerned about is of a great deal of ur\u00ad gency to the Senate and to those of us serving on the committee. I have dis\u00ad cussed it briefly with the leader, private\u00ad ly, and with some other Members. To be candid, I do not know whether or not I would insist on my amendment today. I have two alternatives. I men\u00ad tioned last night that I think we should do now what the House has done. We should conform our rules to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, which I believe would be germane and relevant, since it does deal with earned income and honorariums. I believe that if the Senate understood it, we could move on to a vote today on this matter. But I would like to discuss it and have some colloquy on the floor. Then, if my colleagues felt that today was not the proper time to vote on this matter, I probably would like to offer as a substitute to that a resolution. I think Senator STEVENSON might join me-I have not talked with him this morning, and I cannot speak for him. My substitute would direct that the Gov\u00ad ernmental Affairs Committee and the Committee on Ethics make a study and report back to the Senate, say, within 30 days. I feel that we have been laboring with it so long that it is not something that should go back to the Rules Committee and be involved all this year; because if we in the Ethics Committee are going to administer the rules and the act, we should know it, but I really think it would be better to do one. If we enter into an agreement, I would be willing to agree to a reasonable time limitation; and I say to the Senator that most likely I would not pursue it to a vote to conform it, but I would like to pursue the other instead. The reason why I wanted to discuss it on the floor of the Senate is that .. think we have to bring the problem to the attention of the Senate, and we have not been able to do so on an indi\u00ad vidual basis. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Chair will indulge me-- Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, while the majority leader is deliberating, will he yield? Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I yield. Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, I would like to briefly outline my reasons for sup\u00ad porting the Hart resolution to reinstitute the limit on outside-earned income for Members of the Senate and certain staff. This limit was originally enacted in 1977 in response to public concern about the salary increase for Members of Con\u00ad gress which had gone into effect that January. We adopted the income limit as part of the new rules of Senate ethics, to be effective January 1 of this year. I opposed the recent action of the Senate to Postpone the effective date of the limit and I will support the pending amend\u00ad ment to cancel that postponement. The original enactment of an income limit was, in a very real sense, part of the agreement to let the pay raise stand and I believe that is a basis for regarding the Senate's action as a breach of that agree\u00ad ment. I recognize that it is difficult for some Members who do not have investment in\u00ad come to keep up with inflation, but re\u00ad moving the earned income limit may ac\u00ad tually make the situation worse. With the limit postponed, I expect that there will be considerable pressure for Con\u00ad gress to once again refuse to accept the annual inflation adjustment made for Federal employees. We will soon find ourselves in the position we were in in 1977. That year there was a great public outcry when congressional salaries were increased by 29 percent, despite the fact that real income of Members had de\u00ad creased by 35 percent since the previous raise in 1969. Members have not received the two annual salary adjustments since 1977, and with the limit on outside-earned in\u00ad come postponed, it appears that the cost of living will have to rise another 35 per\u00ad cent before Congress will bring itself to make another adjustment. It is Congress reticence to allow itself reasonable peri\u00ad odic cost-of-living adjustments that se\u00ad verely undermines the purchasing power of those who depend on outside earned income. Finally, while I also recognize that limiting earned and not investment in\u00ad come creates an apparent inequity. I want to point out that the Senate rules of ethics do provide some limitation on Members activities with respect to in\u00ad vestment income as the result of an amendment I offered in 1977. My amend\u00ad ment prohibited Members from spend\u00ad ing such time on the acquisition of in\u00ad vestment income that it would interfere with the performance of their Senate duties. The managers of the ethics reso\u00ad lution incorporated the substo:mce of this proposal by reference into the rules of ethics and that limit stands today. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, if I may, protecting my rights to the floor, I yield to the Senator from Arkansas. Mr. PRYOR. I thank the majority leader for yielding. Mr. HART. Mr. President, a parlia\u00ad mentary inquiry. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield for that purpose. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. The Senator will state it. Mr. HART. What is the pending business? The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. The pending business is Senate Resolution 115. TIME-LIMITATION AGREEMENT-S. RES. 115 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I shall propound the request, and I think it will meet with the approval of the dis\u00ad tinguished Senator from Colorado who has been so patiently waiting. I ask unanimous consent that there be a time limitation of not to exceed 1 hour on the resolution, to be equally divided between Mr. HART and Mr. STEVENS, that there be a time limitation on any amend\u00ad ment thereto of 30 minutes, that there be a time limitation on any debatable mo\u00ad tion of 30 minutes, a time limitation on any appeal of 10 minutes, a time limita\u00ad tion on any point of order, if such is raised and submitted to the Senate, of 30 minutes, and that the agreement be in the usual form with the proviso that a vote occur up or down on the resolu\u00ad tion, if not amended, at no later than 5 :30 p.m. today. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. Is there objection? Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, reserv\u00ad ing the right to object, as I have stated previously it is a personal matter but I have an obligation to be at home tomor\u00ad row and I will have to leave here no later than 4: 30 p.m. to make that plane. It will take me back to Anchorage tonight. Mr. ROBERT c. BYRD. Mr. President, I understand the Senator's situation. I shall revise my request to make the vote occur no later than 4: 30 p.m. today in relation to the resolution, if it is in the meantime amended, or up and down on the resolution if it is not amended no later than 4:30 p.m. today. Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, do I understand the nature of the request now to be that a tabling motion against the resolution would not be in order? Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. No, no, that is not quite the case. I said that if the reso\u00ad lution is amended, then a tabling motion would be in order. If the resolution is not amended, then it would be an up and down vote. Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, I have one problem-it is not mine but, on behalf of another Senator-that I will have to clear to make sure-- Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Yes. Mr. President, I do not mean to hold the floor, but does the Senator from Colorado wish the floor? If he does, I will yield the floor. I merely wanted to get an agreement. Mr. HART. Mr. President, did the ma\u00ad jority leader get such agreement? Mr. BAKER. No. I would like to re\u00ad serve for a moment while we check. Mr. HART. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I will not ob\u00ad ject-the whole purpose here is to get a vote on the resolution as simply and as quickly as possible. The majority leader is doing his utmost, as he always does, to protect the rights of Senators. It was by no means the intention of the sponsor of this resolution to take the afternoon of the Senate, a half-day, to debate this issue. I think if Senators come over here and try to revise the code of ethics and to change the rules and pursue their pet peeves we will have lost the whole object of proposing this resolution. Obviously Senators can do what they want to, and the leader is protecting them. I hope on both sides of the aisle that i;eople will address this issue as quickly and as simply as possible so that we can go on with the business of this country. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. He is right on the bull's-eye. I feel as he does. Everybody knows what the issue is. There ought not be any necessity for taking the whole afternoon for this matter. We just ought to vote up or down on whether or not the Senate wishes to vitiate its action taken on March 8. I supported the action on 6524 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE March 28, 1979 March 8. I oppose the resolution the dis\u00ad tinguished Senator has offered today, but he is entitled to a vote up or down but, at the same time. let me repeat my request so that all Senators are protected: I ask unanimous consent that there be 1 hour on the resolution to be equally divided between Mr. HART and Mr. STEVENS; that there be a time limita~ion on any amendment of 30 minutes; a tune limitation on any debatable motion of w minutes; a time limitation on .a~y point of order of 30 minutes; a time llm1- tation on any appeal of 10 minutes; that Mr. MORGAN have 30 minutes for debate under his control; that no nongermane amendments be in order; that if no amendments are adopted, the vote occur. up or down on the resolution at no later than 4 p.m. today; and that in the al\u00ad ternative, if the resolution is amended, that a vot~ occur in relation to the reso\u00ad lution, as amended, if amended; and that the agreement be in the usual form. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. Is there objection? Mr. TSONGAS. Mr. President, I will not object, but I would only indicate th.at some of us have a meeting at the White House at 2 p.m. on alternate sources of energy, and I would like to be here for the vote. Is there any way we can get an agreement to that effect? Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I wish ~e could get an agreement for the White House to leave us alone at 2 o'clock, and I am not making a ftippant answer to the Senator. I tried to discourage them down there from breaking into the middle of our afternoons, and I am surprised that they are doing it today. we had a meeting in my office today, at their request; had several Senators in there to discuss energy. It seems to me there are plenty of hours early in the day and late in the day when they can have Senators down there. I will talk with them in the meantime to see if they can possibly reschedule that meeting. But, in answer to the Senator's question, at precisely what hour is it set for? Mr. TSONGAS. From 2 to 2:30, with 15 people going. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I can only assure the Senator that if he has to go to the White House I will protect the Senator. Mr. TSONGAS. I thank the majority leader. Mr. WEICKER. Mr. Presdient, reserv\u00ad ing the right to object-- The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. WEICKER. I was not on the floor when the allocation of time was referred to. I have a rather important all-encom\u00ad passing amendment. Whether I pursue it or not remains to be seen and depends on what transpires, but I would like 30 minutes on the amendment. Is that pos\u00ad sible for the distinguished majority leader to include that in his unanimous\u00ad consent request? Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. The only problem with that, may I say to the dis\u00ad tinguished Senator from Connecticut, if I get 30 minutes specified on an amend\u00ad ment that amendment can come in whether or not it is germane, that is my problem. Is the amendment germane? Mr. STEVENS. I might state that the amendment is germane, but it does enter into the problem of notice again, and I have discussed this with the distin\u00ad guished Senator from Connecticut as to whether or not he would agree to the procedure that we are trying to work out with the Senator from North Carolina with regard to reference to the Govern\u00ad mental Affairs Committee and the Ethics Committee of the total problem of the Ethics and Governmental Affairs Com\u00ad mittees and the existing ethics rules and having a report back to the Senate with\u00ad in a reasonable time to deal with that issue separately from the earned income provisions. If that is agreeable-and the Senator understand there is a problem of no\u00ad tice because his proposal does exceed the scope of the earned income rule, is that correct, is my interpretation cor\u00ad rect? It does, does it not? Mr. WEICKER. Does it exceed the scope of the resolution of the distin\u00ad guished Senator from Colorado? The answer would be \"Yes.\" Does it exceed the scope of the issue, and I am not talk\u00ad ing about Senate ethics, the answer is, \"No.\" It is restricted absolutely to both the Ethics Committee and the Ethics\u00ad in-Government Act. Mr. STEVENS. Yes, but there is a problem of 24 hours' notice. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. It is not 24 hours; it is a day's notice. Mr. STEVENS. The Senator gave the 1 day's notice and that complies with the rule. With regard to rule XLIV, the Senator from Connecticut's proposal and the Senator from North Carolina's pro\u00ad posal exceed the scope of rule XLIV, and, therefore, it would be subject to a point of order in terms of this procedure now of not having complied with the 1 day's notice. But I am hopeful that the Sen\u00ad ator from Connecticut will agree to pur\u00ad sue the course outlined to the Senator from North Carolina. The Senator can discuss his proposal here today but have the matter go to the Governmental Af\u00ad fairs Committee and the Ethics Commit\u00ad tee, then having it reported back here. with their recommendations and with the Senator's material and the Senator from North carolina's material, which would go to those two committees to be reviewed by them under this procedure. I concur, I might add, with the Senator from Colorado. I do hope we can work it out to get an up or down vote on the Senator from Colorado's proposal which, in effect, would repeal the action that was taken by the Senate at the request of my resolution here several weeks ago, and that I think we would like to seek a clean vote on whether or not the Senate wants to uphold or reverse the action we took 3 weeks ago. Mr. ROBERT c. BYRD. I would also like to see a clean vote on the proposal that Mr. MORGAN and Mr. WEICKER are making. I am afraid if we attach amend\u00ad ments to this resolution there is going to be a tabling motion, and then the issue will be all fuzzed up again. Then the Senate will be criticized for not voting on the issue when it, indeed, would have voted by virtue of a tabling motion. But I have heard it said before that a tabling motion does not stake out where the Sen\u00ad ate stands. I would like to see an up or down. vote on this resolution because I want to vote against it, and others will want to vote for it, but I am afraid if we have amend\u00ad ments coming in and cluttering this up, then we are going to have a tabling mo\u00ad tion, and I reserve the right to move to table myself. I hope the distinguished Senator from Connecticut and the distinguished Sen\u00ad ator from North Carolina will get to\u00ad gether and work out a resolution; I would be glad to try to get an agreement on it to act quickly on it, as soon as possible. It would require an agreement, of course, but I would be glad to try. I now yield to the distinguished mi\u00ad nority leader. Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, if the ma\u00ad jority leader will yield to me- Mr. ROBERT c. BYRD. I beg the mi\u00ad nority leader's pardon. Mr. BAKER. I thank the majority leader for his statement, and I appre\u00ad ciate his yielding. I asked him to yield. On further check\u00ad ing on this side of the aisle it is likely that there will be a tabling motion if, in fact, there is an amendment to this res\u00ad olution, and that the unanimous consent request that the majority leader pro\u00ad pounded, that is, for an up-or-down vote on the resolution, if it is unamended, is acceptable on this side, and there would not be an objection. I, too, would hope we could have an up\u00ad or-down vote on this resolution and dis\u00ad pose of this issue. I not only respect what the Senator from Connecticut is trying to do, but I support it, as I have in the past when he has previously offered it. But at this point I would hope we can get an up-or-down vote on the Hart reso\u00ad lution, so we can dispose of that branch of the issue at this time, and I pledge to the Senator from Connecticut that I will support his proposal if presented at an\u00ad other time. Mr. WEICKER. Mr. President, reserv\u00ad ing the right to object for the purpose of propounding a parliamentary inquiry, where does that leave us in respect to the Senator from North Carolina and I being able to make our point in connec\u00ad tion with the resolution of the Senator from Colorado? Mr. BAKER. If the majority leader will yield to me so that I can attempt to an\u00ad swer the Senator from Connecticut, if the unanimous-consent request of the majority leader is granted as pro\u00adpounded-- Mr. WEICKER. What was that? Mr. BAKER. That there be a time limi\u00ad tation on the resolution and amend\u00ad ments to the resolution, and that the agreement be in the usual form. Unless the Chair holds also that amendments do not require a day's no\u00ad tice under the rules, the Senator from Connecticut would be precluded, and he would simply have to request that his amendment be referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs and the Com\u00ad mittee on Ethics for further considera\u00ad tion. Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. WEICK.ER. I yield. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor. March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 6525 Mr. COHEN. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield? Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Yes. Mr. COHEN. I want to commend the leadership and the Senator from Colo\u00ad rado for attempting to bring the resolu\u00ad tion of the Senator from Colorado to an up-or-down vote. I think if we do nat have an up-or-down vote on it, we will simply be getting ourselves into a worse position. Mr. BAKER. I certainly agree with that. I hope we can accommodate the Senator from Connecticut and the Sena\u00ad tor from North Carolina, but I also hope we can get on promptly to a vote on the Hart resolution as is. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may pro\u00ad pound another unanimous-consent re\u00ad quest without withdrawing the one now pending. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. Without obje::;tion, it is so ordered. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that before the close of business today, the distinguished Senator from North Carolina and the distinguished Senator from Connecticut may be recognized, after the close of other legislative business and before the close of the day, to call up their resolu\u00ad tion to amend the rules, with the 1 day's notice to be waived, and that there be\u00ad how much time for debate? Mr. MORGAN. I would like to have, maybe, half an hour, just for the pur\u00ad poses of a discussion of the reasons for it. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Would the Senator anticipate any amendments? Mr. MORGAN. No, I would not. Mr. WEICK.ER. I would want 5 min\u00ad utes or so. A total of 30 minutes? That would be the total for both of us? Mr. MORGAN. Yes. Mr. WEICK.ER. Since we are both on the same track. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. That there be 1 hour, to be equally divided between Mr. WEICKER. and Mr. MORGAN, and that votes could occur up or down on the resolu\u00ad tion, with no amendments in order there\u00ad to. How is that? Mr. WEICK.ER. Reserving the right to object, has the distinguish .ed Senator from North Carolina so drafted his reso\u00ad lution as to address it to Senate Resolu\u00ad tion 101? Mr. MORGAN. If the majority leader will yield, the resolution I have drafted simply says: The Select Committee dn Ethics shall re\u00ad view the desirability of repealing, repealing in part or modifying Rule XLII of the Stand\u00ad ing Rules of the Senate. I would propose adding into it Senate Resolution 109, with particular reference to the differences between them, and that each committee shall report the re\u00ad sults of its review, together with its rec\u00ad ommendations. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for reading the reso\u00ad lution. I remove my proviso that there be no amendment thereto, because the Gov\u00ad ernmental Affairs Committee may feel that it has some jurisdiction, and might wish to amend it. This would allow 1 hour on the resolu\u00ad tion, with 20 minutes on any amendment, debatable motion, appeal, or point of order, if such is submitted to the Senate, and that no amendment not germane be in order. This would still allow the Gov\u00ad ernmental Affairs Committee, if it wanted to and felt it had jurisdiction, to offer an amendment. Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do not expect to object, I generally agree with the ma\u00ad jority leader, and feel this is the best way to cut through the redtape, but I feel I owe an obligation to the ranking mi\u00ad nority member of the Rules Committee, who is not presently on the floor, to ob\u00ad tain his approval. Mr. STEVENS. Could we tie down the request on the Hart resolution, however? Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President-- Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Does the Sen\u00ad ator from Arkansas reserve the right to object? Mr. PRYOR. Yes. Reserving the right to object, I am trying to protect, Mr. Leader, the right of my colleague from Arkansas <Mr. BUMPERS), who is on his way to the floor, to offer an amendment. I understood it had to be mentioned at this stage in the debate to permit him to do that. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I understand that amendment is not germane. I won\u00ad der if anyone can advise us. Mr. BAKER. Tu it to the Hart resolu\u00ad tion on the Morgan resolution? Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. It is to the resolution by Mr. HART. I did include the nongermane provision in my request. Does the Senator know what is in the amendment? Mr. PRYOR. I am sorry, I do not know what is in the amendment. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Does the Sen\u00ad ator from Colorado know what is in the Bumpers amendment? Mr. HART. Only that it had something to do with outgoing Members' honoraria. Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, we have no objection to the formulation stated. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Very well. 1 ask that the record show that I repeat my request with respect to the resolution by Mr. MORGAN and Mr. WEICKER. The request was as follows: Mr. ROBERT c. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that before the close of business today, the distinguished Senator from North Carolina and the distinguished Senator from Connecticut may be recognized, after the close of other legislative business and before the close of the day, to call up their resolution to amend the rules, with the 1 day's notice to be waived, and that there be 1 hour, to be equally divided between Mr. WEICKER and Mr. MORGAN , and that votes could occur up or down on the resolution, with no amendments in order thereto. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. Is there objection? The Chair hear.::; none, and it is so ordered. Mr. HART. Mr. President, if the majority leader will yield, regardless of the state of germg,neness of the amend\u00ad ment by Mr. BUMPERS, as I understand, he will under the order be permitted 30 minutes on his amendment, and I believe he will be adequately protected. Senators were on notice that this mat\u00ad ter was coming up at noon today. I do not know how we have spent 45 minutes in nonsense, in procedural harangue, here. We could have had the vote on the issue. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I certainly can understand the frustra\u00ad tions of the Senator from Colorado. Mr. BUMPERS' amendment is not germane. He can call it up and let the Chair rule and if the Senate wants to overrule the Chair, it can. That is about the only thing I can say. Otherwise, we shall get no agreement, because there are going to be Senators who will object to nonger\u00ad mane amendments. I think it is a sure way of getting a tabling motion on the resolution offered by Senator HART. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the Senator from Arkansas <Mr. BUMPERS) be permitted to have 30 minutes on his amendment before any question of germaneness or point of order, if such would lie, be raised. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. Is there objection? The Chair hears none. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. STENNIS. Mr. President, I have just walked into the Chamber. There has been no agreement here on time, has there? Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. That is the request I have just made, that there be a 1-hour limitation for debate; 30 minutes on any amendment, debatable motion, or point of order; that a vote occur no later than 4 o'clock p.m. today; and that no nongermane amendments be in order. Mr. STENNIR That suits me all right. I wanlt a small amount of time in opposi\u00ad tion to the resolution. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. Is there objection? The Chair hears none. It is so ordered. Mr. WEICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Geoff Baker and Mr. Steven Moore, of my staff, be permitted the privilege of the floor dur\u00ad ing the course of debate on the amend\u00ad ment of the Senator from Colorado and the resolution of the Senator from North Carolina. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HART. Mr. President, a parlia\u00ad mentary inquiry. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. The Senator will state it. Mr. HART. What is the pending busi\u00ad ness? The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. The pending business is Senate Resolution 115. Mr. HART. Mr. President, 2 years ago, the Senate passed Senate Resolution 110, limiting a Senator's outside income\u00ad Mr. STENNIS. Mr. President, may we have order now? The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. The Senator's point is very well taken. The Senate will be in order. Mr. HART. It limited a Senator's out\u00ad side income to $8,625 a year from earned sources, or 15 percent of a Senator's an\u00ad nual salary. This provision was a subject of extensive debate and national pub\u00ad licity and became, of course, a key f ea\u00ad ture of the Senate Code of Ethics, which was adopted in the last Congress. A few weeks ago-on March 8 of this year, to be specific-the Senate passed by a voice vote a resolution to defer for 4 years the implementation of this rule. The effect of the Senate's action will be 6526 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE March 28, 1979 to leave in place a previously legislated $25,000 a year limit on outside earned income. Mr. President , I regret that the Sen\u00ad ate acted earlier this month, with no committee consideration , very little floor debate, and, most importantly, no re\u00ad corded rollcall vote. I equally regret that few Senators were on the floor to give the action the careful consideration it de\u00ad served. The resolution which I have offered today provides that the 15 per\u00ad cent annual outside earned income limi\u00ad tation embodied in Senate rule XLIV take effect at once, or retroactively, as of the first of this year. Mr. President, it is my understanding that, according to the time agreement entered into, we shall have a rollcall vote on this amendment. If the amendment or if the resolution is tabled, it is my intention to bring it back up again so that we can have a rollcall vote, up or down, on the simple proposition of limi\u00ad tations oh outside earned income. I think that rollcall vote will offer every Sena\u00ad tor an opportunity to be on record on what I consider to be an important mat\u00ad ter of both Senate ethics and Senate procedure. In light of all the publicity that has occurred with regard to this issue-pub\u00ad licity, I must say, which would lead peo\u00ad ple around the country to believe that there is no other matter of national or international urgency except the prop\u00ad osition of how much Senators can earn\u00ad some important distinctions have, unfor\u00ad tunately , been lost. Those distinctions re\u00ad late primarily to the merits of the issue of the amount of outside earned income as opposed to the method which the Sen\u00ad ate adopted to change that limitation. I have stressed, in my remarks so far, out\u00ad side earned income because, unfortu\u00ad nately, most of the debate and discussion about this issue in the last couple of weeks has made it appear that this limi\u00ad tation applies to all outside income. It does not. It applies to earned income. When we debated this a couple of years ago in connection with ethics reform and the increase in Senate salaries, there was extensive debate about the difference be\u00ad tween earned income and unearned in\u00ad come; but, as a result, I guess, of the procedures adopted by the Senate a\u00b7 cou\u00ad ple of weeks ago, that distinction has been blurred. Unfortunately, the people in the coun\u00ad try have, forgotten that it is possible to have unlimited unearned income and still be a U.S. Senator; that is to say, immense holdings of all sorts of prop\u00ad erty that return income to the holder of that property. It permits the possi\u00ad bility of at least a suggestion of conflicts of interest on votes that are cast and so on and so forth. Nevertheless, we chose not to place limitations on that unearned income and Senators can have all sorts of property interests and still be Sena\u00ad tors. They can receive, for all practical purposes, unlimited amounts of money as a return on that investment and still be Senators. Those who attempt, one way or an\u00ad other, to earn money from other sources while holding their Senate seats are placed under restrictions, formerly of $25,000 a year and, as a result of the later actions taken, slightly over $8,000 a year prior to our recent decisions. I think it is important , Mr. President, to keep in mind the distinction that we are discussing here today. It is a distinc\u00ad tion which relates to earned income by Senators. It does not place any limita\u00ad tion at all, unfortunately, on the income of Senators from unearned sources. I think it is very important that the Amer\u00ad ican people understand that, even though it is the intent of the Senator from Colorado to try to return to where we were before, under the procedures that we adopted before, to the previous low limit on earned income. I think what concerns people as much as anything else was the method that the Senate used in reversing the previous decision. That was, as I have indicated, a voice vote. No one requested at that time-Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate? The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. The Senate is not in order. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from Colorado may pro\u00ad ceed. Mr. HART. What offended many American people and many journalists was the method used to reverse the de\u00ad cision. A certain citizens' lobby described this method of a voice vote, as \"greed and cowardice.\" I do not think it is a question of greed or cowardice. It was a step taken by rep\u00ad resentatives of both sides, both political parties, both sides of the aisle-in some cases, people in leadership positions. Senators were on the floor who objected to that procedure , but chose, for one rea\u00ad son or another, not to request a rollcall vote, which would have been very sim\u00ad ple to do. I do not think we ought to question anybody's motives, and it is not my in\u00ad tention to do that here today. In fact, I take strong issue with the statement of the leaders of the so-called citizens' lob\u00ad by that this was an act of greed and cowardice. I do not think it was that at all. I think any statements of that sort are well wide of the mark as to what the real issue is here today. The resolution which is before the Senate, which the majority leader was so helpful in bringing before the Senate, and the leaders on both sides of the aisle, will put Senators on record as to their views on the limitations on out\u00ad side earned income, as to whether we should return to our previous limitation of $8,625 a year, or whether we shall go back to the even earlier limitation of $25,000 a year. If we are able to get, sooner or later, a vote on this issue, then Senators will be on record and their constituents can make their own deci\u00ad sions on whether their Senators voted their will on this issue or not. I think we are reversing here today, or will shortly reverse, what seems to be a part of the grievance registered in the press and by the public about their view of our making this change. But, Mr. President, I want to once again take very strong exception to those who have said that the Senate has acted in a cowardly way or that what is in\u00ad volved here is a matter of greed. I do not want, as I already indicated , to go back and repeat the debate of 2 years ago about financial conditions of Senators. I do not think there are very many American people that think that the Senate ought to be an organization limited to the wealthy. It was and has been over much of the history of this country pretty much that kind of insti\u00ad tution, unfortunately. But I think, given current moods in the country and attitudes of the people, they at least like to have a few people here who are not wealthy individuals . I do not intend to stress the cost of holding office. I think my constituents understand, and I think the constituents of a lot of us understand, the costs of maintaining two residences , the inciden\u00ad tal costs of a variety of kinds that people get into in holding national office, par\u00ad ticularly office that requires constant travel back and forth, and other ex\u00ad penses of that sort, that are not paid for out of the public treasury. The point here is, Mr. President, that on this issue, if nothing else, I am con\u00ad stantly reminded of Thomas Jefferson's observation that when you become a pub\u00ad lic servant, you become public property. As a result of fairly early recognition and understanding of that principle, I have taken pains myself, when running for office as well as every year I have been in office, to release my own financial records, particularly the annual tax forms. We have procedures for reporting out\u00ad side earned income, and I guess unearned income, for that matter. So these matters will be on the public record. Even if they were not on the public record, it has been my own policy throughout my limited public career to make them a matter of public record, how much taxes I paid, what I earned in honoraria. In 1976, I guess my honoraria income was just slightly over $13,000. In 1977, I earned $8,920 in speaking engagen:ents . That has been pretty much the record over the past 4 years, as far as I am concerned. So I do not believe that this Senator is making a killing off his public office and he does not intend to. He will con\u00ad tinue, whether the Senate or the law requires him to or not, to publicly dis\u00ad close to his constituents, or anyone else who cares to know, not only how much money he made from all sources every year, how much taxes he paid, but also what the source of that income was. My own policy, and each of us, I guess, has to make his own decision on this, is not to accept money for speeches in my own State, not to accept any honoraria for speeches to any organizations that may have a direct or immediate interest in legislation, or, for that matter, I guess, an indirect or nonimmediate interest. We all have our own decisions about that, but, ultimately, we are responsible to our constituents, and they are the ones that have to make the decision. In order to make that decision, I think they have a right, and I think that right is recog:.. nized by the leadership on both sides of the aisle, to know where we stand on this issue of what the limit ought to be. But I certainly hope, Mr. President, that out of this, hopefully, brief discus-March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE 6527 sion and deliberation today, the people will keep in mind that there is a signifi\u00ad cant discrimination between those who earn money in addition to their Senate salary and those who get income from so-called unearned sources, and that there are substantial differences in the restrictions on those, that the net effect of those restrictions is to encourage, I think, one way or the other, individuals of wealth to hold Senate seats. I think that is not healthy for the Republic, myself. But there we are. We have to deal with the mood, and the times, as we find it. When this issue arose, the mood was, and I am afraid still is, very much anti-Government, and a lot of that mood focuses on the Congress of the United States. We are dealing here, I think, Mr. Pres\u00ad ident, with a symbolic issue as much as anything else. I do not know the average numbers, really, whether that limitation is $8,000, $9,000, $10,000, or maybe for that mat\u00ad ter $25,000. I do not know. What is of concern to people, and I think was of great concern to a large number of journalists, particularly , edi\u00ad torial writers, based on editorials I have seen here, was the method used to change this procedure. We are going to reverse that today. We are going to change that method and see what the mood of the Senate is and what the individual Members feel on that. I yield to the Senator from Wisconsin. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I am in\u00ad terested in the Senator's observation about the method and the editorial com\u00ad ments of the papers. I would just like to say, in all good humor, it would not make any difference how the Senate or the Congress handled the question of salaries. It would be at\u00ad tacked editorially anyway. When we created the Presidential commission back in the sixties for the purpose of taking the decision away from the Senate and the Congress, allowing an independent Presidential commission of distinguished American citizens to de\u00ad cide what should be the salaries of the higher echelons of the executive branch, the judiciary, and the Congress, it was then thought that this objective group could make the recommendation and then it would become law, unless some\u00ad body demanded a rollcall. It seemed to me a very sensible approach. I do not like to have to make the deci\u00ad sion as to what the salary ought to be. There is no other job like it. If I had the income of a number of people in this body, I would happily serve here for nothing because it is a very interesting, challenging position to have. So if we have a rollcall, we are at\u00ad tacked for voting for the salary increase. If we do not have a rollcall, we are at\u00ad tacked for not having a rollcall. In any event, we are attacked as having a con\u00ad flict of interest because we set our own salary. We have to face the prospect, I say to the Senator, that no matter what Con\u00ad gress does, it will be attacked for it. I just wanted to sav a word, if I may, about why that limitation is where it is. It was put in there by me as chairman of the ad hoc committee that dealt with the ethics question, the question of limita\u00ad tions on income. It is not a magic figure, by any means. In fact, I thought it was too low. But I put it in because that is what the House did. So we in the committee adopted the same limitation as the House. It was my personal view that that limitation was too low, although I add that it makes no difference to me, since I do not have the time nor the interest to take the hassle of running around the country even to reach the current limitation. I have no interest in that. But it was a figure that I picked up because the House set that limitation, even though I had thought the limitation was lower than it should be. However, it was adopted in conjunc\u00ad tion with the adoption of the Presiden\u00ad tial Commission's recommendation on salaries. It should not have had to be tied to that at all. The salary recom\u00ad mendation was by an independent com~ mission headed by Mr. Peterson, former Secretary of Commerce. Distinguished business leaders, labor leaders, and lay\u00ad men served on the commission and made that judgment; and in my view, we should have accepted their judgment and need not have tied this with it. But we did. So that was the compact, so to speak, made at the time; and, in my judgment, we should live with that until the next Presidential Commission. That is the length of time, it seems to me, we are ob\u00ad ligated to maintain this income limita\u00ad tion for the 4-year period during which the Commission's recommendation for salary is in effect, until the next recom\u00ad mendation, which I believe will come in January of 1981. On that ground, I support retaining the limitation we put in, and that was recommended by the ad hoc committee that I handled, and it was voted on a rollcall vote on the floor of the Senate after a considerable amount of debate. Then, if a change should be made, if one wishes to make a change, I think the ap\u00ad propriate time to do that is at the ex\u00ad piration of the 4-year period of the salary recommendation of the Presi\u00ad dential Commission. Mr. HART. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin. Mr. WEICKER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. HART. I yield. Mr. WEICKER. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from Colorado that I am delighted that he has brought the issue to the floor for a vote. That should have been done; except that I also want to make clear that, to me, the crux of what is to be considered by the U.S. Senate and the American public is not the issue of honoraria but the entire is\u00ad sue of the ethics code and the Ethics in Government Act. I will not be discussing the resolution of the distinguished Sen\u00ad ator from Colorado next to this debate. There will be intervening business, I imagine. I just want to point out that, in the totality of what needs to be considered, it is this plus what the distinguished Sen\u00ad ator from North Carolina will be raising. I know he will get the headlines, and I also know it is important. I also commend the distinguished Sen\u00ad ator for having this matter brought to a vote. That I agree with. Nothing else I agree with. Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. HART. I yield. Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I com\u00ad mend the Senator from Colorado. Where we usually get into trouble is not having a rollcall vote. When I served in the House, there were issues of pay raises. It seems that Congress has a great deal of difficulty in coming to an up-or\u00ad down vote in these matters, and the American people might have more confi\u00ad dence in our procedures if we had that rollcall vote, which I hope we will have this afternoon. At the Constitutional Convention, this matter of remuneration for Members of Congress was discussed; and Jam es Mad\u00ad ison said that it would be safe to let Con\u00ad gress set their own pay, because they al\u00ad ways would have a vote to which people could look, to see how they voted. In the 4 years I was in the House, I frequently raised the issue and, indeed, brought a lawsuit requiring that there be a rollcall vote. I think the American peo\u00ad ple will be much more understanding of what we do, whatever it is, if there is a vote; and I hope we have that up-or\u00ad down vote this afternoon. I join the Senator from Colorado and others in seeking such a vote. Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I wel\u00ad come a rollcall vote on this matter, and I hope we will have an opportunity to vote up or down on the Hart resolution. It was originally my resolution which was adopted by voice vote on March 7; and if there was any confusion concern\u00ad ing its adoption at that time, I apologize to the Senate. However, let me state for the RECORD that the notice given on my resolution exceeds the time of the notice given on this resolution. As a matter of fact, I had discussed my resolution many times with Members of the Senate, and it was common knowledge that at the ti::ne the rule was first adopted, I was quite disturbed with that Senate action. During that time, I was the ranking minority member of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee and I met with representatives of both the current ad\u00ad ministration and the previous adminis\u00ad tration. We discussed the question of the pay raise and we found that the position taken by both administrations was to support the Peterson Commission report in recommending the pay raise. At that time, the Senator from Illinois <Mr. STEVENSON) supp_orted the proposi\u00ad tion. He was a leader of the reform move\u00ad ment at the time, as was the Senator from Wisconsin <Mr. NELSON). I do not take umbrage at the com\u00ad ments that have been made by the Sen\u00ad ator from Colorado (Mr. HART). We have all read them in the newspapers. The press is entitled to draw the conclusions it wants from actions we take. When the Senator from Illinois, the chairman of the Ethics Committee, came 6528 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE March 28, 1979 to the floor on March 7 and said that he would support my resolution, that was an indication to me that the Senate was ready to vote to provide another 4 years before this new rule had to take effect. The reason for my position is that, first, the Constitution provides that you cannot reduce the pay of a chief execu\u00ad tive nor the pay of a Federal judge. The other two branches of government have a protection against reducing their in\u00ad come during the term of their service. While this resolution does not reduce the pay, it does reduce the earned-income potential of a Member of the Senate. I took the position that, at least for one full term, that that was unfair and that we should be subject to the same policies that are applied to the other two branches of government. I point out, parenthetically, that I never have taken the full amount of honorarias that I could have accepted. I do not have earned income, because I am a member of the legal profession, and our code of professional responsi\u00ad bility prohibits a sitting Member of Con\u00ad gress from engaging in private practice. As a matter of ~act, even before the rule was adopted, the day I was appointed to the Senate I closed my law office, and I have not practiced law 1 day since that time. So I imposed on myself the code of ethics before it was adopted by the bar association. However, what we are talking about here is earned income, not just hono\u00ad raria-all earned income. We are talking about the tradition in this Nation that we should have a citizen national legisla\u00ad ture and whether that tradition shall be preserved. When a decision is made by a person to come to Washington to serve, or attempt to come to Washington to serve, in Congress, that person must de\u00ad cide whether he or she has the independ\u00ad ence to return back and to be able to earn a living and not be dependent upon this position in Congress. Common Cause has been more misled on this position than on any other posi\u00ad tion they have taken, because the issue is not the amount of honoraria. The issue is whether we can have a right to return to our lives at home after leaving the Congress, earn a living, and be independ\u00ad ent of the pressure groups that affect the national Congress. Only the lawyers today cannot do that; but, technically, we still are practicing law, whether we consider it so or not. We are involved in the enactment of laws, so it is really the same as if we are practicing law, so far as I am con\u00ad cerned. But I have known Members of Congress during my lifetime who have been doctors and have continued to practice, who have been veterinarians and have continued to practice, who have been optometrists; who have been peo\u00ad ple from all walks 0f life, and they kept their connections with their particular income-producing capabilities. So they had the right to go home and the inde\u00ad pendence to do so. The question here is not how much you should earn in terms of honoraria. I can show any Member of the Senate how these rules work any time he wants and legally, as a matter of fact. This is a question of honor to a Sen\u00ad ator. It is not a question of rules. Common Cause has led us to a position where this Senate will become the House of Lords. This body will be made up of only people who are independently wealthy if this rule becomes effective. It would limit a person to $8,600 gross in\u00ad come. Harry Truman kept open his haber\u00ad dashery. He went home when the Senate was not in session. Now what happens today? If that rule became effective it would be all right if he incorporated and let someone else run it, put out a sign in the front saying \"Senator Truman's Haberdashery\" and took all of the busi\u00ad ness that came into Senator Truman's Haberdashery, but if he worked for a salary 1 day while the Senate was in session it would be considered unethi\u00ad cal. Imagine that. A veterinarian can go home now, since the Senate adopted my resolution and he can keep up his business, he can go and be a part of his business, and keep his clientele if he is a dentist, an optometrist, whatever he or she might be, and he has the independence to go home and the independence to stand up and vote his conscience. This resolution will turn us back to the point where we are subject to more pressure, not less pressure, more pressure as Members of the Senate because we will not have any source of income to go back to. We have to be able to maintain our independence. I think that it is unconscionable to tell a member of a profession or a busi\u00ad ness that if he determines to run for the Senate, he must come here with the knowledge that he has to cease doing anything while the Senate is in session that would lead to a gross income from that business in excess of $8,600. There are some things that constitute very borderline questions under rule 44. My late wife had a plant shop. I went over and helped her on weekends. I knocked off the plaster. We put in new. walls. We did a lot of things. That busi\u00ad ness earned money. Under rule 44, had it been effective at that time-since my work did contribute to the income from that family business while the Senate was in session, I would have violated this rule if we had more than $8,600 in income. What is wrong with that income? We declared that income. Under the disclosure rules we have to disclose all sources of income in excess of $100. Let us look at the rules. We now say all income in excess of $100 has to be declared and disclosed, all personal property, held for business purpose or for investment, all debts owed, all prom\u00ad ises of future employment, all gifts re\u00ad ceived, all patent rights held, all hon\u00ad oraria received, all real estate owned, and all nongovernment positions held must be disclosed. Those are the provi\u00ad sions of rule XLII. The Ethics in Government Act last year duplicates this, and adds a little more. That is one of the things that Sen\u00ad ator MORGAN and Senator WEICKER right\u00ad fully are going to address. It provides for complete disclosure of all income plus all reimbursements received. Rule XLV contains the conflict of in\u00ad terest provisions. We can have no outside professional activity which may interfere with our official duties. We cannot be af\u00ad filiated with a firm, and I have said that that is redundant with the Bar Associa\u00ad tion's position anyway. We cannot hold any position as a director or officer of any public regulated corporation. We cannot lobby for 1 year after we leave office. Rule XLVI limits the funds we can use to official expenses, to personal funds, funds received from the Senate, funds that are donated and reported under the Political Reparting Act, and reimburse\u00ad ments received. We have a complete setup for full disclosure. I was part of the committee that considered in conference the Fed\u00ad eral Election Campaign Act. We set a new limit of $25,000 honoraria. We did not deal with the question of outside earned income. We did not want to limit those people who might want to seek a position in the Senate to any kind of income limitation, because that puts an\u00ad other impediment in the way of those people who could and should serve in the national Congress for a period of their life. Many people owe this Government some part of their life. But they do not owe this Government the duty to be\u00ad come permanent professional legislators. Some of us are, but many do not choose to be. I would rather see the right for a person to come here and maintain a con\u00ad nection with his earned-income capacity than I would to see this body filled only with people who have the right to un\u00ad limited unearned income. That is the situation that would have persisted had my resolution not been adopted on March 7. Just remember: Unearned income is not subject to any limitation. It is unlimited. You can get a million dollars from coupon clippings, but you cannot earn more than $8,600 gross if you work for a living. The concept of earned income limits wrapped up in that portion of the Peter\u00ad son Commission was wrong. I stated at the time I would work to undo it. We did not undo it with Senate Resolution 93. What we did was to give it 4 more years, give the Federal Election Act 4 more years and let even Common Cause see what happens. We disclose everything we do finan\u00ad cially. We disclose everything we own. We disclose even what our wives and minor children earn and what they do. And if after 4 years the public record is not complete, if then the public can\u00ad not make up its mind who is here for the purpose of using the office of U.S. Sena- tor to increase his earned income and who is earning income to preserve his in\u00ad dependence as a Senator, then I per\u00ad sonally will not press the issue in 4 years. But if I am here, and God willing I will be here, and by the grace of God I am March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENA TE 6529 here right now, I believe that we should wipe this provision out entirely, and I pled&e to try to wipe it out entirely be\u00ad fore the end of those 4 years if the dis\u00ad closure rule works as it should. But right now the issue is not hono\u00ad raria. That is a false issue. Some feel the members of the press owe the public an apology for that, because this is not a question of honoraria. It is a question of earned income and it is a question of where we stand in the community. Do we have to beccme financial eunuchs to come to the Senate? I certainly hope we do not. I will tell you, Mr. President, I can think of nothing in my Government ca\u00ad reer, which now goes over many years, that more disturbs me than the way that this action has been misinterpreted. We had a voice vote, because the Senate un\u00ad derstood it is the process of leadership to stand up and take a position which preserves the integrity of the Senate, to take a position which keeps our inde\u00ad pendence and preserves the right of average citizens to come here and serve and still go back to his or her life after the decision was made, in the national interest, to vote against the best wishes of our constituents. I am glad that this resolution has been presented, and I thank my good friend from Colorado for presenting it because, as I said, no thing has bothered me more than the com\u00ad ment that it was handled in a sneaky way. It was not sneaky. Senate Resolu\u00ad tion 93 was handled precisely the way we have handled hundreds of resolutions since I have been here. We called it up. There was a day's notice. It was printed in the RECORD. It was listed in the Daily Digest. It was discussed on the cloakroom recordings. We had a whole morning for debate. We had an order to vote a half\u00ad hour after the vote that was to take place on the amendment offered by the Sena\u00ad tor from Virginia (Mr. BYRD). That vote did not take place. When that vote did not take place, Senators asked if there was going to be a vote? We said there was not going to be a vote: The Senator from Virginia's amendment is not going to come to a vote. That was interpreted by some people as saying we were not go\u00ad ing to have a rollcall vote then at that time on any subject. Then we asked how can we have a roll call vote on the Stevens resolution if we just said there was not going to be a rollcall vote, be\u00ad cause of that misunderstanding? It was a misunderstanding. I do apolo\u00ad gize to the Senate not only for the con\u00ad fusion in that regard but for the adverse publicity that came to the Senate, be\u00ad cause of the procedure. But I do not apologize for the action the Senate took with respect to my resolution, and I hope the Senate has the wisdom and the cour\u00ad age to stand up and preserve the rights of those who are not here yet to main\u00ad tain their independence for the future. I reserve the remainder of my time. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the provisions of rule XLII, XLV, and XLVI be placed in the RECORD following the conclusion of my prior remarks. CXXV--411-Part 5 There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: RULE XL!I12 PUBLIC FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 1.

(f) The Select Committee may grant one or more reasonable extensions of time for filing any report but the total of such exten\u00ad sions shall not exceed ninety days.

The Secretary of the Senate may furnish a copy of any such report without charge or at a reduced charge if he determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because furnishing the information can be considered a.s primarily benefiting the public. (c) Any report received by the Secretary of the Senate shall be held in his custody and made available to the public for a period of seven years after receipt by the Secretary of the Senate of such report. After such seven\u00ad year period, the Secretary of the Senate shall destroy any such report. (d) The Select Committee shall review all financial statements filed pursuant to para\u00ad graph 1 to determine whether such state\u00ad ments are filed in a timely manner and are complete and in proper form.

UP AMENDMENT NO. 55 (Purpose: To prohibit the acceptance of honoraria by Members, officers, and em\u00ad ployees of the Senate, except for donation to certain tax-exempt organizations) Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BRADLEY) . The amendment will be stated. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Arkansas (Mr. BUMP\u00ad ERS) proposes an unprinted amendment numbered 55. Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: S. Res. 115, a resolution to make Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate effective on January 2, 1979. At the end of the resolution insert the following new section: SEC. 2. (a) Paragraph 2 of rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate is amended- ( 1) by striking out subpara\u00abraphs (a) and (b) and inserting in lieu thereof the fol\u00ad lowing: \"(a) A Senator, officer, or employee of the Senate shall not receive any honorarium for any appearance , speech, or article.\"; and (2) by redesignating subparagraph (c) as (b) and by striking out \"Notwithstanding the limitations under paragraph 1 or 2 (b) (2), any Sena.tor, officer, or employee may ac\u00ad cept honoraria in exces of the amount al\u00ad lowed in paragraph 1 or 2 (b) (2) but not in excess of $25,000\" in such subparagraph and inserting in lieu thereof \"Notwithstanding the limitation under parf1\u20acraph 1 or the pro\u00ad visions of subparagraph (a) of this para.\u00ad graph, a Senator, ofiicer, or employee may ac\u00ad cept honoraria, but not in excess of $25,000 during a calendar year\". (b) The amendments ma.de by subsection (a) shall take effect as of January 1, 1979, except that the provisions of rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, as in ef\u00ad fect on the day prior to the date on which this resolution is agreed shall continue to apply to any honorarium received for an ap\u00ad pearance made or speech delivered before such date or for any article submitted and accept.ed for publication before such date. Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, Sena\u00ad tor BELLMON from Oklahoma made one of the funniest comments on this sub\u00ad ject when this issue was :first debated in the Senate. Another Senator was trying to persuade Senator BELLMON to raise the limit on honorarium for a speech from $1,000 to $2,000; HENRY said: March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE I would love to help but, I am such a. lousy speaker when they pay me $1,000 everybody knows it 1s a bribe. Some people in this body make quite a bit of money on honoraria because they are captivating and entertaining speakers. In that respect, allowing Sen\u00ad ators to accept honoraria for speeches is unfair. Some Members receive more invita\u00ad tions because of committee assignments or eloquence. From that standpoint, everybody does not share equally in the fruits of honoraria. I do not think the Senator from Colorado or anybody else will def end the sacredness of limiting income to 15 per\u00ad cent of our salary, which was $8,625. Any Senator who has children in college and maintains homes in his or her home State and in Washington can use the additional income. The other night on the evening news, one of the truckers was saying that he objected to the President's 7-percent guideline. He objected by saying: What kind of increase did Congress get- 29 or 30 percent? I thought what an unkind cut that was. We got an increase in salary 2 years ago, and this fellow still remembers it. I can go back home and tell my con\u00ad stituents, \"The last time Congress got an increase in pay was in 1967. The in\u00ad crease 2 years ago translates into a 3- percent annual increase or roughly one\u00ad third of the inflation rate over the same 10-year period.\" When I explain this to my constitu\u00ad ents, I might as well be talking to that wall, because they are not interested in hearing it. They realize that the increase in pay we received is above the median family income of 85 percent of the peo\u00ad ple in my State. As the Senator from Alaska said we are hardly financial eunuchs around here a~ $57,500. Even though all of us, par\u00ad t~cularly those with sons in college, some\u00ad times have a little difficulty in making ends meet. I do not think any Senator will dis\u00ad agree that any specific limit on hono\u00ad raria is highly arbitrary. Is $8,700 right? Is $25,000 less right? What would be a proper figure? $15,000? Do you think that is going to change the editorials in this country? If we are doing this to please the press and our constituents back home hono\u00ad raria ought to be eliminated because they do not like any part of it '$8 625 or $25,000. ' , The amendment I just sent to the desk, Mr. President, eliminates all honoraria except those that are donated back to charity with a limitation of $25,000. I know this amendment has little chance of passing. Mr. HART. Mr. President will the Senator yield for a question?' Mr. BUMPERS. Yes. Mr. HART. Has the Senator's amend\u00ad ment defined what a charity is and, if not, would that definition include the education of the Hart children? [Laugh\u00adter.] Mr. BUMPERS. Well, let me read the law to the Senator and I will let him de-cide whether his children come within it: (c) Notwithstanding the limitations under para.graph 1 or 2(b) (2), any Senator, officer, or employee may accept honora.ria. in excess of $25,000, if he donates such honora.ria. to an organiza. tion- That excludes the Hart children\u00ad exempt from taxation under section 501(c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and if no tax benefits accrue to such Sena.tor, officer, or employee for such donation. So, Senator, I would have to say that you were cut out again. Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield to me for just one question? Mr. BUMPERS. Yes. Mr. STEVENS. Maybe it will be a statement more than a question, if I may, on my time. Mr. BUMPERS. I have 30 minutes and I am not going to use that much time. Mr. STEVENS. I hope the Senator will understand that I did not intend this to apply to the salary we receive as Sena\u00ad tors. What I am talking about is what our capacity would be to earn a living if defeated, defeated primarily because of taking positions which were inconsistent, which were independent, you might say, of our own electorate. I think that the necessity to have a back-door political life, to be able to know that you can provide for your family if you are de\u00ad feated, is essential to being independent, and I hope the Senator will agree with that. Mr. BUMPERS. I do not agree or dis\u00ad agree with that. Is the purpose to limit the income of a Senator? If it is, why not limit the interest income I receive? How about eliminating the rent I get from my farm? How about eliminating income that Sen\u00ad ators get from their old law firms or whatever the source of their income? If it is inherently bad for a Senator to re\u00ad ceive income from any source other than his Senate salary, about 99 Senators are going to have to resign. If you are going to eliminate income, all of it ought to be eliminated, but that is not the purpose of my amendment. My amendment simply prohibits the taking of an honorarium while you are serving in the Senate. Aside from the clamor of the public and the press to limit honoraria, is there a legitimate reason for Senators to be away from the Senate in order to earn independent income? Should not we be here? If the Hart resolution is defeated, another resolution should be introduced which says that nobody can receive an honorarium for making a speech during the time the Senate is in session. That would eliminate some of the problems, would it not? Do we limit honorarit. to eliminate undue influence? If you are on the Bank\u00ad ing Committee and you make a speech to the American Bankers Association for $1,000 is that undue influence? If the truckers, who do not want to be dereg\u00ad ulated, invite somebody from the Com\u00ad merce Committee to speak to the truck\u00ad ers association, is that undue influence? You cannot make a speech that cannot be construed as an effort to influence you in the future on legislative items of interest to the group paying you the honorarium. Assume my amendment is adopted. You cannot receive honoraria from the American Bankers Association, but they say: We cannot pay an honorarium, Sena.tor, but we would love to rent the penthouse in Caesar's Palace for you and your wife for 3 days to come out and sit on a panel. We will invite you for a. weekend on Lake Tahoe on so and so's yacht or sailboat. They do not talk about honoraria, but when it is all said and done the expenses run $4,000 or $5,000. How has that Sen\u00ad ator been any less influenced than if he had flown out and back and taken a $1,000 honorarium? I think there is a great deal of hy\u00ad pocrisy in this Chamber. I can live with the limit on honoraria either way. I can live just as well without it. Is it fair for 30 Members of the U.S. Senate to be millionaires, and 20 Mem\u00ad bers essentially limited to their salary? This reminds me of what the President said one day about medicaid abortions: There is not much fair in this life and some people always suffer and get discrimi\u00ad nated against. Incidentally, I did not agree with his statement on that. It is either right or it is wrong. You cannot make it a little bit or a whole lot right, or a little bit wrong or a whole lot wrong. You cannot be a little bit pregnant. If the Members in this body honestly feel that honoraria are inherently wrong-and they must or we would not have limited honoraria to $8,625-let them stand up and be counted and vote to eliminate honoraria altogether. It will be a financial sacrifice by everybody, but it might be therapeutic for all of us. I hope that the Members of this body will support this amendment . In this case, I think we have a chance for the U.S. Senate to stand up and say the American people should be pleased with this system. I do not find that much fault with it, but as long as the American people find fault with it, the credibility and integrity of this body are further eroded. I do not know how much further the Congress and the other institutions of this country can be eroded before all those dire predic\u00ad tions Thomas Jefferson made 200 years ago will come true, when he said that the consent of the governed will not be forthcoming in the future. Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? Mr. BUMPERS. Yes. Mr. DOLE. The Senator from Kansas was not on the floor when the Senator started. Does he eliminate all income? Mr. BUMPERS. Yes. Mr. DOLE. All income, or all-\u00ad Mr. BUMPERS. All honoraria. Mr. DOLE. Unless you give it to char\u00ad ity, is that it? Mr. BUMPERS. Yes. That provision is in the bill now, and I have left that in. Mr. DOLE. I appreciate that. If we 6534 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE March 28, 1979 would eliminate all other income ex\u00ad cept for our Senate salaries, I would vote for it. Mr. BUMPERS. I have made that point. We should eliminate all outside income. Mr. DOLE. I think we are getting down now to where it would hurt. Mr. BUMPERS. I want it to hurt. Mr. DOLE. But we ought to hurt ev\u00ad erybody, not just 40 percent of this body. Mr. BUMPERS. That is my point. I made the point of unjust discrimina\u00ad tion. Mr. DOLE. There are two Senators in this body, one can take in a million dollar::: and the other cannot write a book or go out and speak over the week\u00ad end, because that is forbidden. Mr. BUMPERS. But if we try to cor\u00ad rect that, only two Senators would vote for it, the Senator from Kansas and I. Mr. DOLE. We might make it two client..c: or three clients per Senator, and we might get some support. I do not know who is in either group. All I know is what group I am in. Some of those who might be supporting this may be out this weekend, making speeches for honorariums themselves. If we could eliminate all income, the Senator from Arkansas might be on the right track. Mr. HART. Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas, in his customarily elo\u00ad quent way, has described a serious kind of discrimination between earned and unearned income, and then indicated that perhaps-I think the Senator from Kansas stated 60 percent of the Senators receive a lot of income from un\u00ad earned sources, and 40 percent have to earn it, and then the Senator from Arkansas seeks to introduce an amend\u00ad ment to further increase discrimination. I do not quite follow his logic, but there it is. He further makes a couple of other arguments against his own amendment, saying that even if honoraria were lim\u00ad ited it would not prevent anybody from entertaining Senators and their families quite lavishly, that that would not be an honorarium and consequently there would not be any limit on the amount of entertainment that might go on. The question here, I think, is not the question of entertainment, but that if Senators are going to be compromised, we could adopt the amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas and there would still be a hundred or a thousand ways to compromise Senators, politically, financially, or any other way. This amendment will not stop Senators from being compromised if they are going to be compromised by appearing before a group. So at the appropriate point, I shall raise the point of order on this amendment as to germaneness. I would just say, Mr. President, that the purpose of the pending resolution was originally to get, as quickly and simply as possible, an up or down vote on the issue of restoring the original limitation on earned income. The Senator from North Carolina, the Senator from Con\u00ad necticut, and others have exercised some forbearance in not trying to amend the resolution. I think if we try to solve all the ethical problems of the Senate, all the questions of financing and outside earnings and all the rest of it, with this resolution, we will have removed the whole point, which was merely to cor\u00ad rect what I think was an error in judg\u00ad ment on the part of those who offered the original resolution and permitted it to go to a voice vote. If we try to permit amendments to solve other ethical or financial problems, we will have obscured the whole point and will not get to the principal issue. I want to permit the Senator from Arkansas to make all the arguments that time permits here, and then I will make a point of order. Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I will take a few more minutes, and then yield back the remainder of my time in order for the Senator to make his point of order. I voted for the original ethics bill. Sometimes when I look at some of the provisions, I wonder why. But that ethics bill neither prevents Senators from com\u00ad promising themselves through any num\u00ad ber of alternatives they might select, nor does it insure the honesty of anyone in this body. My father believed and often said that by the time a child is 14 or 15 years old, the hay is\u00b7 in the barn. He either has it or does not have it. All the laws in the world are not going to change that. I know my amendment is not germane. I knew it when I offered it, and I asked the majority leader to get me 30 minutes to debate it before the vote was taken. I think I have made my point. I am going to vote for the resolution. I am going to vote for it with consider\u00ad able reservation. I know the Senator from Colorado's resolution will not pass, because there has been a headcount taken. Everybody knows the outcome of this right now. I can live with it or without it. When you think of all the reasons for the rule on honoraria, the resolution of the Senator from Colorado is not going to affect any of it. It will not keep you honest or keep you from being unduly influenced. If you are going to be unduly influenced, you will be unduly influenced by $8,625 just as fast as by $25,000. If you are going to take a bribe, you would take $8,625 just as fast as you would take $25,000. I am not one of the wealthier Senators, but I have an outside income. There is an element of hypocrisy when we limit the honoraria received by Senators, but do not limit the other types of outside in\u00ad come a Senator can receive. Those with independent income will continue to spend their own money to be elected, to live fairly opulent lifestyles, and good luck to everybody else. Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Senator from Colorado, there is one Senator who wishes time from my time. Mr. BUMPERS. If the Senator will let me yield my time back, he can make the point of order. Mr. STEVENS. I would like to see if we can get a vote here before 2 or after they come back from the White House. Mr. HART. Mr. President, I shall make the point of order shortly. I should like to get a vote on the resolution. I do not think there are any other amend\u00ad ments. We can have the matter disposed of by quarter to 2. Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator. Mr. HART. No one is going to change his mind. Mr. President, I make the point of order that the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas is nongermane. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken. The amendment goes beyond the scope of the resolution and, therefore, is not germane. Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator from Colorado yield for just a moment? Mr. HART. Yes, I yield. Mr. STEVENS. I have one obligation to yield time to the Sena tor from Mississippi and I want to make sure he is protected. I think we need to warn these people whether they should go or stay, really. Mr. HART. Mr. President, I want to yield 1 or 2 minutes to the Senator from Michigan and then I am prepared to vote. Mr. STEVENS. May we have an agree\u00ad ment that we divide the time between now and 8 minutes before 2? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. STEVENS. I make a request, if it is agreeable with the majority leader, that the Senator from Colorado and I di\u00ad vide the time and after time, we yield back all the time we have left at 8 min\u00ad utes to 2 and start the vote at 8 minutes before. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, will the Senator withdraw the request? Mr. STEVENS. I withdraw the request. If the Senator from Colorado will yield to me, I yield to the Senator from Missis\u00ad sippi for 5 minutes. Mr. STENNIS. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, I hope I am not dis\u00ad rupting anything else here. On this mat\u00ad ter, I first want to pay my respects to the Senator from Colorado. There is no Member here that I have more respect for than I do for him and the very fine work he has done. He is earnest and sin\u00ad ctre in what he does. I am not speaking at the request of anyone. No Member of this body has mentioned this matter to me or asked me to speak, at least. I shall not be af\u00ad fected by it, one way or the other, which\u00ad ever way the pendulum swings. But there was a time when I would have been af\u00ad fected. Back when my children went to college in the 1950's-and I do not want to go into personal matters any more than I have to, we were maintaining a home in Mississippi, as we wanted to do and as Mrs. Stennis and I felt we should do. We were also maintaining and owned a home here-that is, we had a deed to it. It had a mortgage on it. We thought that was best for the family. Both chil\u00ad dren were in college. If I had not had at least some outside income, it would have been an impossible situation, to a de\u00ad gree, just dollar-for-dollar, with no con\u00ad siderations otherwise. I understand some of our colleagues March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 653\u00b75 here now are in that same condition, with three or four or five children, and have many approaching college years, many of them. There is no way around it, they have to have the money then to send their children to college. To put the penalty on them just because they are Members of the Senate is personally wrong. It is a wrong to them, as I see it. It is a financial matter that they cannot cope with reasonably without tremen\u00ad dous sacrifice. I understand that now, at the present salary, when it comes to a person buying a home in Washington, a Member of this body, just on sheer fi\u00ad nancing, is not eligible. If he has noth\u00ad ing beyond his income, nothing appreci\u00ad able beyond it, he will not qualify to buy a home for a family here because those prices have gone up so high. Even beyond all of those things, we believe in the U.S. Senate as an institu\u00ad tion. That is one of the reasons we aspire to come here. Unless we leave those con\u00ad ditions comparable to what they were then, it would not have appealed to us enough to have ever aspired to it. We are downgrading it, making membership in it second rate in this way, at least, and in other ways, I think. An institu\u00ad tion cannot retain its vigor and respect and its place in the public mind and thought and respectability as a whole when it has these limitations on it that many of us think are wrong and unfair, and put the institution and the mem\u00ad bership-all the membership-on the defensive. We are not just trying to take care of ourselves when we ask that some, at least some, more reasonable figure be allowed here for what they earn with their own effort-the membership. We are defend\u00ad ing an institution. It does not belong to us, even, it belongs to the people. It is an institution. People, on second thought, anyway, a great majority of them, I am satisfied, would not want this restriction, this limitation, and this question mark that is put on the name of every Member here, not to be trusted beyond 15 percent of his legal salary, to have a percentage in the course of a year beyond that. With all deference to anyone, it is piti\u00ad ful, it seems to me, that we should drop into that rut, however good intentions we might have, that we can lower this great institution in such a fashion. As I say, I speak with great respect to those who have the other view and those who have called for a roll call. I made a mistake on this matter when I voted the other way. I have not forgot\u00ad ten the speech of the Senator from Maine. I understood that there had been an arrangement of some kind, a packag\u00ad ing, something I had not kept up with. I want to rectify that mistake. But that is not enough. I cannot give a stronger rea\u00ad son than that to my colleagues. I cannot influence them. I repeat, let us measure this without regan: to the person or the individual, ourselves, or anything else except this institution. Keep it where the door will always be open and a person will not have to make so much sacrifice, personal sac\u00ad rifice, to be a Member. Who wants to be left between the idea of sending his chil-dren to college and straining here with a rule of the Senate that puts a ceiling on his talent for honest toil, honest labor, honest night work? I believe the second thought of the Senate will say we should destroy that limitation, so-called. We shall let every\u00ad one look the constituency in the face, the world in the face, the columnists in the face, and say the better rule has been adopted. I thank the Senator for yielding. Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from Mississippi very much. Mr. HART. Mr. President, I yield 3 minu~es to the Senator from Michigan. Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, I support Senator HART'S resolution. I believe that the lim\u00ad itations on outside earned income for Senators and staff adopted in 1977 rep\u00ad resented a wise decision by the Senate and I see no compelling reason to delay their implementation. Senator HART'S resolution fulfills the promise made to the American public in 1977. It satisfies reasonable public expectations about what the public is paying us for, and it will strengthen the public's confidence in the Senate as an institution. I also want to take this opportunity to comment on the procedural aspects of this vote. There is no doubt in my mind that, when this matter first came up 3 weeks ago, the distinguished majority leader's actions were totally consistent with the rules of the Senate. Indeed, when there was a request at one point to vote imme\u00ad diately on the motion to delay imple\u00ad mentation of rule 44, the majority leader worked out an agreement which post\u00ad poned such action until the next day. He demonstrated his customary determina\u00ad tion to protect all the Members of this Senate. Last night, the Senator from Colorado planned to offer an amendment to the debt ceiling limit which would have re\u00ad scinded our action delaying rule 44. At that time, a unanimous consent request was introduced limiting debate to 20 minutes. I objected to that request even though I shared the desire of this body to resolve this issue. I objected last night because it seemed to me that, with few of us on the :floor, the setting of a 20-minute time limit on what was then an unprint\u00ad ed nongermane amendment of this im\u00ad portance might prove to be inadequate and unwise. Also, I was considering of\u00ad fering a perfecting amendment to what was then our amendment of Senator HART. That time agreement would have, as a practical matter, prevented me from doing that. At the time the unanimous consent request was made, I had not had sufficient time to discuss that perfecting amendment with a number of colleagues with whom I wished to consult. There\u00ad fore, I felt compelled to object to that request. I have now had an opportunity to discuss my concerns with several of my colleagues and to study the statements made by the distinguished majority lead\u00ad er as they appeared in the RECORD of yesterday's proceedings. I have concluded that the perfecting amendment I was considering is not necessary. I do not in\u00ad tend to offer it. But, the basic point is that it was only after I had time to con\u00ad sider and discuss the issue with my col\u00ad leagues that I reached that conclusion. If I had been forced to act last night, I may have acted differently. In my case, at least, the delay was of value, and a valid one. I thank the Chair. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Will the Sen\u00ad ator yield? Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for a very candid and clear statement as to the Senator's position and his reason for objecting to the request last evening. I respect him for his reasons and I congratulate him on his fine statement. Mr. HART. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from South Caro\u00ad lina. Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I was pleased to join the distinguished Senator from Colorado in support of this resolu\u00ad tion. I happen to have been vice chairman of the committee that wrote the code of ethics for the Senate. At that time, the question arose concerning outside in\u00ad come. The salaries of Senators had been raised, and raised on the theory that we would not have to accept a large amount of outside income. I think that we ought to think well be\u00ad fore we vote on this because it is hard to explain to the people that we are get\u00ad ting the salary we do, $57,500 a year, and accept outside income. As the former vice chairman of the Special Committee on Official Conduct in the 95th Congress, I was closely in\u00ad volved in the background and process of changing the Senate rules to encourage higher ethical standards. One of the most hotly contested and debated issues was that dealing with limitation on outside earned income. Mr. President, this was not a matter taken lightly by the special committee, A number of witnesses were called totes\u00ad tify that honoraria paid for speeches by Senators and other public appearances were getting out of hand. Special interest groups were more than willing to sched\u00ad ule Senators to speak for a $2,000 fee realizing that there may be more to the intent of the honoraria than meets the eye. In addition, regardless of the intent of outside income, there is always the pos\u00ad sibility of the appearance of impropri\u00ad ety when those sums are very high. Therefore, as the debates on the ethics code indicated. a 15-percent cap on out\u00ad side income is reasonable. A Senator should not appear to be using his office for his own personal financial gain and take undue time away from his job, even though his speeches and public appear\u00ad ances may serve a p'tlblic good. I realize that it is a hardship on some people to stay here on that salary, but I believe that we can do it. I think we ought to do it. I think we ought to set an ex\u00ad ample. I think we have got to appear right to the people, as well as be right. 6536 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE March 28, 1979 In my judgment, it is a right of the people to show we are not here just to grab all we can for ourselves. I hope the resolution will be agreed to. Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Alaska. Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished majority leader such time as he may require. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I will simply say that I made a statement at the time the Stevenson resolution went into effect and at that time I stated that there should be a limit on outside income. I supported the 15-percent limitation. Since that time, I have changed mY mind as to the 15-percent limitation. I feel that the disclosure provisions are adequate, and in view of the supporting statement by Mr. STEVENSON, who is chairman of the Ethics Committee, I feel all the more so. So long as there is full disclosure, there certainly should not be any conflict of interest as between a 15- percent limitation and a $25,000 limita\u00ad tion. The people are going to be the judges at the time of election or reelection of each Senator. These are not public funds. It is outside-earned income. Therefore, I shall oppose the resolution that has been offered by Mr. HART. I congratulate him on his efforts to bring the matter to a rollcall vote. As I indicated yesterday, there was adequate notice given to Senators at the time of the March 8 vote, and they are all pre\u00ad sumed to read the RECORD, or to know what is in the RECORD with respect to the program. It was clearly stated in the Digest of the RECORD of March 7 that there would be a vote on the adoption of the resolu\u00ad tion the following day, not later than 12: 30 p.m. It was not set for a specific time: It said not later than 12: 30 o.m. A vote, as all Senators know, can be a vote by voice, or a vote by division, or a vote by rollcall. So Senators or their staffs had notice. I have every right to believe they read the RECORD. So, as far as adequate notice was concerned, it was given. I heard the distinguished Senator from Eouth Carolina say a moment ago that Senators can grab all they can grab. Mr. President, may I say that it is up to each Senator to determine whether or not he wishes to accept any honoraria. If he want to limit himself to 15 percent of his earnings, that is up to him. If he does not want to accept any honoraria at all, that is up to him. If he wants to accept honoraria and give the honoraria to charity, that IB up to him. No Senator is forced to accept more than 15 percent. No Senator is forced to accept any honoraria. So this business of Sena tors being here to \"grab all they can grab,\" I know nothing about that. I do not think that any Senator here has that purpose in mind. I would imagine, as far as most Senators are concerned, as to what they earn in honoraria, probably half of it is going for income tax payments anyhow. So it is not a matter of \"grabbing.\" Any Senator who wants to accept a speaking engagement is under no ob\u00ad ligation to accept an honorarium. Any who want to limit themselves to 5 per\u00ad cent, 10 percent of their salary, or 15 per\u00ad cent, they can do it. But this $25,000 limit has been in effect now for something like 4 or 5 years. The action by the Senate on March 8 in ex\u00ad tending the limitation was not an in\u00ad crease in the honoraria over what it had been the previous 4 or 5 years. It was an extension of that same limitation for an additional 4 years, with Senators re\u00ad taining every right to decline to accept honoraria if they want to, give it away to charity if they want to, limit themselves to 15 percent if they want to. So I think that the record should be clear. Again I say, it is not public money. There is adequate disclosure. Every Sen\u00ad ator has to disclose what he earns in honoraria and the source of each hon\u00ad orarium, and as long as we have that kind of disclosure, I believe that, as the Senator from Illinois <Mr. STEVENSON) has stated, the extension of the earnings limitation for 4 more years need not raise any conflict of interest question. So I shall vote against the resolution. I supported the action of the Senate on May 8, and so stated to the press in my weekly press conference. An up-or-down vote today will clear the air. Let the Sen\u00ad ate work its will. If it wants to vitiate its previous action, let it vitiate it. If it does not, I hope t.hat will resolve the situation and that Senators will not be accused of \"grabbing,\" or running under the desks to hide in order to avoid a vote. Each of us is going to be accountable to our constituents when we run for reelec\u00ad tion. The record is there. Honorariums are publicly recorded; there is full and adequate disclosure. So let the record stand. Mr. HART. Mr. President, I ask unan\u00ad imous consent that the name of the Sen\u00ad ator from Nebraska <Mr. ZORINSKY) be added as a cosponsor of the resolution. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HART. Mr. President, the Senate faces extremely important business of this country. It relates to the economy, energy, national security, and foreign policy. Whatever steps we take cannot be taken unless we have the confidence of the American people. We can gain that confidence only by cutting square cor\u00ad ners, by crossing the t's and dotting the i's. I hope Senators v..ill vote for this reso\u00ad lution today. If not, at least they will be on record. I yield back the remainder of my time. e Mr. STEVENSON. Mr. President, as I said last time this matter was raised in the Senate, the code of conduct and the law contain many measures to cope with each form of possible misconduct in the Senate. The receipt of honoraria, their use, and public disclosure are covered by the Federal Election Campaign Act. Hon\u00ad oraria are subject to public disclosure, and the amounts are limited by that law. As if it were not enough to let the people judge their Senators, the code also prohibits any outside earnings which create a real or apparent confiict of interest. If outside activities divert a Senator or staff member from his con\u00ad scientious performance of duty, they are punishable. Affiliations with law firms and other businesses are expressly pro\u00ad hibited. And to enforce all such pro\u00ad hibitions and guard against any impro\u00ad prieties, the Ethics Committee issues rulings and investigates in accordance with procedures established by rules of the Senate and the committee. I regret that honoraria are still neces\u00ad sary in the legislative branch. Like many of my colleagues, I earmark my own for charity and official expenses--and still must subsidize my office from my pocket. In addition to the official expenses, Sen\u00ad ators must maintain two homes. They must transport families between the two. Their personal expenses are increased by the nature of their office. It would be best if Senate salaries were somewhere near comparability with the private sector; the tax treatment and ex\u00ad pense allowances made comparable. Un\u00ad til this is done, I will support some relief by this means, knowing that other rules and laws prohibit abuse. My interest is in saving the Senate from exclusive mem\u00ad bership \u00b7for those who are rich or im\u00ad provident. We have come too far already from Jefferson's vision of a legislature made up of farmers, lawYers, business people, and tradesmen, traveling from their homes and places of business periodically to make the Nation's laws. The rise of the full time, regulated, professional law\u00ad maker may already be associated with the country's decline and the public's discontent. The reasons for my support of this resolution were well stated recently in an editorial by the Washington Post. Mr. President, I ask that it be printed in the RECORD. The editorial follows: [From the Washington Post, Mar. 12, 1979] SENATE INCOME AND ETHICS Senators Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Dan\u00ad iel P. Moynihan (D-N.Y.) are likely to get some flak for sponsoring the sudden move to defer, until 1983, the rule that would limit senators' outside earned income to 15 percent of their salaries ( $8,250 per year) . Instead, these two men and Senate Ethics Committee chairman Adlai E. Stevenson III (D-Ill.) should be commended for bringing this issue out of the cloakrooms and being willing to explain why they favor suspending a rule that they voted for two years ago. We think they're right-and that reflects some rethinking of our own. In 1977 we too supported the 15-percent rule as part of the stringent ethics codes that the Senate and House adopted, after much turmoil, in tan\u00ad dem with their pay raise from $44,600 to $57,500. We saw this as a package that would give members of Congress more adequate incomes, reduce the likelihood of conflicts between official and outside activities, and promote public confidence in Congress' ca\u00ad pacity for self-discipline. Since then, we, like many others, have grown more and more concerned about the smothering effect of too much righteousness and rules of conduct and disclosure that require people in public service to give up too much. The 15-percent limit on legisla\u00ad tors' earnings, which took effect this year, is near the top of that list. It is more stringent March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 6537 than concerns for conflicts of interest or institutional seemliness justify. It gives too little flexibility to lawmakers who need or want to augment their salia.rtes and can do so without slighting the public's business . We would not rush to the opposite ex\u00ad treme and sweep away all curbs on legisla\u00ad tors' outside activities. Nor has the Senate done so. Last week's action leaves intact the more sensible limits on speaking fees and honoraria-$2,000 per appearance and $25,000 overall per year-in the campaign law of 1976. As Sen. Stevenson emphasized, senators are still constrained by ethics rules that require full disclosure of outside earn\u00ad ings and prohibit the types of professional activities , such as practicing law, that are most likely to produce conflicts of interest. Those safeguards are surely enough to pro\u00ad tect what Sen. Stevens called \"the public interest in honest senators.\" Moreover, if a senator does exploit the higher limit by spending too much time on the lecture cir\u00ad cuit, be ls likely to bear about it from bis constituents , who are the ultimate judges of senatorial conduct in any case. Some problems with the public may yet flow from the way the Senate's action came about. Unhappiness with the 15-percent rule is widespread . Yet the subject was thought too sensitive for normal processing through public hearings, committee action and a roll\u00ad call on the floor. Instead, the Stevens-Moyni\u00ad han measure was introduced Wednesday eve\u00ad ning and passed by voice vote Thursday noon with few senators on hand. Three spoke for it. Three were present to object; three more put statements of opposition in the Congres\u00ad sional Record later that day. Nothing has been beard from the others, including more than 40 who voted for the rule two years ago. Their shyness may feed public sus\u00ad picions that the Senate ls doing something sneaky and untoward . We hope the House will be more straightforward when the issue comes up there.e REVERSAL OF S. RES. 93 Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, rule XLIV, which limits outside earned income of United States Senators, is an inequitable restriction. Mr. President, no Member of this body wants to lower the ethical standards by which we conduct our affairs. Our ethical code should enforce just con\u00ad duct of the Senate. It also should insure equitable treatment of each individual Senator. If a limitation on earned in\u00ad come is justifiable, then a limitation on unearned income is equally justifiable. Is a Senator who exceeds the $8,625 limit on outside income through honoraria less virtuous than he whose unearned income has surpassed this arbitrary limit? I think the answer is obvious. The answer is no. But Mr. President. let us turn now to the crux of the argument, the question of discrimination. What bothers the Senator from Kansas, and should bother all Senators. is the unequal treatment given to two classes of Senators: Those who have unearned income and those who do not. The question may well be asked: Is unearned income any more ethical than earned income? To many, the reverse would seem more logical. Mr. President, if this limitation were being placed upon a group of individuals who were not Members of the Senate, the courts would call it invidious dis\u00ad crimination. The limitationf' placed on earnings are purely arbitrary. No logical reasoning is involved. Mr. President, if it is wrong for a Member of Congress to receive outside income then all outside income must be prohibited. If we are to put a cap on the amounts of outside income received then we must put a cap on all outside income, not just one kind. Anything else is a double standard. We're not talking about individual gain. We are talking about simple justice. There should not be one set of rules for those with outside earned income and one set of rules for those with unearned income. Mr. President, a single standard should be set for all. Mr. President, the Senator from Kansas believes that full disclosure is the best safeguard against all abuses. The Senator from Kansas has followed the practice of full disclosure and will continue to do so. But, Mr. President, he also believes that the financial limitation as proposed is discriminatory and should be rejected as long as no such controls are in place on outside unearned income. Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I hope the vote today will be a vote to preserve the integrity, the honor, and the opportunity for future Senators to be independent. I yield back the remainder of my time. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. Mr. HART. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SAR\u00ad BANES) . Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Chair state the question? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question before the Senate is on agreeing to Resolution No. 115, offered by the Senator from Colorado (Mr. HART) and other cosponsors. The question is on the resolution itself. On this question the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CRANSTON. I announce that the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. HOL\u00ad LINGS) is necessarily absent. Mr. STEVENS. I announce that the Senator from Oregon (Mr. PACKWOOD) is necessarily absent. I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Oregon (Mr. PACKWOOD) would vote \"nay.\" The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any Senators in the Chamber who have not voted who wish to vote?

The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Several Senators addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen\u00ad ator from West Virginia, the majority leader. Will Members please clear the aisle and take their seats? The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. May I have attention of Senators? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend for a moment until we obtain order in the Chamber? Will Members please clear the aisles? The Senator from West Virginia. Members will clear the aisles and take their seats so that we can proceed with the business of the Senate. TIME-LIMITATION AGREEMENT\u00ad H.R. 3091 AND CARRYOVER BASIS LEGISLATION Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, it is the hope of the leadership to be able to call up the coun\u00ad tervailing duty waiver bill today, but be\u00ad fore doing so, and I have discussed this with the distinguished manager of that bill, there are a couple of requests that I shall attempt to secure agreement on prior to calling up that measure, and they are as follows: I believe that if these requests can be granted, it will be pos\u00ad sible then to get up the countervailing duty waiver bill and have action thereon hopefully today. I would also hope to call up some other measures before the day is over, this being Wednesday. I ask unanimous consent that H.R. 3091 be held at the desk, that it be later taken up today, with time limits of 1 hour on the bill, 1 hour on germane amend\u00ad ments, 1 hour on an amendment by Mr. LONG to extend certain expired child sup\u00ad port provisions; and that no other non\u00ad germane amendment be in order and that the agreement be in the usual form. Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object-and I shall not ob\u00ad ject-it is my understanding that there is another request the majority leader will make, and if that is granted--6538 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE March 28, 1979 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Yes. Mr. BAKER. If these are granted, it is his desire to proceed with the counter\u00ad vailing duty bill? Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Yes. Mr. BAKER. I have no objection. Mr. JA VITS. Which bill? Mr. BAKER. The countervailing duty bill. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. That there be a time limit on any debatable motion, ap\u00ad peal or point of order, if such be sub\u00ad mitted to the Senate, of 30 minutes. Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi\u00ad dent, reserving the right to object, is it not the intent that there be one agree\u00ad ment for the two issues involved? Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Is the Sena\u00ad tor talking about the carryover basis for estate tax purposes? Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Yes. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, at such time as the Committee on Fi\u00ad nance, of course-and this is the remain\u00ad der-reports such legislation on the carryover basis, the bill will be a privi\u00ad leged matter to be debated with a time limit of 1 hour on the bill, 2 hours on the provision repealing the carryover basis, and with no other amendments in order. Provided further, that there be a time limit of 30 minutes on any debatable motion, appeal, or point of order, if such be submitted to the Senate; and that the agreement be in the usual form. Mr. JA VITS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, did we agree to the previous unanimous-consent request? The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. It is all in one request. Mr. JAVITS. What is this one? I do not get it. I am interested in H.R. 1147 re\u00ad specting countervailing duties. What is that request? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will inform the Senator from New York that it is the Chair's understanding that only one unanimous-consent re\u00ad quest has been put to the Chair encom\u00ad passing two issues, and I believe the ma\u00ad jority leader has now fully stated the unanimous-consent request pending be\u00ad fore the Senate. Mr. JAVITS. What is it? I reserve the right to object. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. The Chair is correct. My request did not encompass the countervailing duty bill. As to the explanation of the substance of the request concerning the amend\u00ad ments, I will ask the distinguished chair\u00ad man of the committee (Mr. LONG) to respond. Mr. LONG. Mr. President, there are some of us who feel that we should insist on an amendment to continue the por\u00ad tion of child support program which faces an immediate loss of funding, to continue a provision that helps make it possible for welfare mothers to find em\u00ad ployment in day care centers, to correct some errors in the work incentive pro\u00ad gram tax credit that helps people off wel\u00ad fare rolls to find their way into employ\u00ad ment, and also to continue an expiring social services provision which has to do with the rehabilitation of alcoholics. We are willing not to offer those amendments on other legislation pro-vided that they can be offered on this State legislators' expense bill which in\u00ad volves something we have passed before. Senators would be willing to withhold their amendments on these expiring pro\u00ad grams if they could put them on this State legislation bill. There are other Senators who want to offer an amendment that has to do with the carryover basis, and they are willing to withhold offering it to the counter\u00ad vailing duty bill providing they have an opportunity to vote on it on a subsequent bill. With that assurance, they would be willing to withhold. That is why we are asking that when the Committee on Finance :finds some relatively minor bill, something I would hope that can be agreed to, then we would report it out with the amendment relating to the re\u00ad peal of the carryover basis, and we would have an agreement that the matter be voted on. In other words, Senators favoring that amendment are willing to settle for the will of the Senate provided they can have a vote, and on that basis the Senators would be willing to withhold their amendment at this time. That would help us to clear this bill so that- Mr. JA VITS. This bill being which, the countervailing duty? Mr. LONG. The countervailing duty bill. Mi. JA VITS. When would the majority leader wish to call that up? That is what I do not understand. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. ImmC'Ciiately. May I say-- Mr. JA VITS. Do we have a time limit on it? Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Not yet. I wanted to get agreement on the other two first so that there would be an under\u00ad standing that the amendments the Sena\u00ad tor is talking about would not be offered. Mr. JAVITS. Would the other two fol\u00ad low the countervailing duty bill? Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I was attempt\u00ad ing to say to the distinguished Senator, if he will allow me to complete my state\u00adment-- Mr. JAVITS. I am sorry. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD (continuing). That the purpose of trying to get the agreements on the other two first is so that Senators would be assured they would have a vehicle to which to offer their amendments. Then it would be my desire to go to the countervailing duty bill hopefully with an agreement on it, and we can proceed with it immediately, and thus the risk of the amendments to which the Senator alluded, which might be added to that bill, would be .nil. Mr. JA VITS. I have no objection but I want to know whether what the Senator is asking for on the State legislators and the carryover-what is his unanimous\u00ad consent request? Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I will repeat it. I have asked unanimous consent that with respect to-- The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend for a moment? I think it would be helpfuI if the Senate would be in order and would listen carefully to the unanimous-consent request and then we may be in a position to expedite our business. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. The request is as follows: That the State legislators' expense bill, H.R. 3091, be held at the desk; that it be later taken up today with time limits of 1 hour on the bill, 1 hour on germane amendments, 1 hour on an amendment by Mr. LoNG to extend certain expired child support prov1s10ns; that no other germane amendments be in order; that there be a time limit on any debatable motion, appeal, or point of order, if such be sub\u00ad mitted to the Senate, of 30 minutes, and that the agreement be in the usual form; provided further, at such time as the Committee on Finance reports such leg\u00ad islation repealing the carryover basis for estate purposes , the bill would be a priv\u00ad ileged matter to be debated with time limits of 1 hour on the bill, 2 hours on the provision repealing the carryover basis, and with no other amendments in order. Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I have an amendment, too, on the countervailing duty bill, I had it on the bill when we quit last year, which was carried, and then the whole thing died, and I would like to be in\u00ad cluded in this exclusive corporation so that I, too, may present my amendment. Mr. LONG. Will the Senator tell us what his amendment is? I do not know what it is. Mr. JAVITS. I wish I remembered it, too, but I know I have it. I think it was some welfare amendment that you ac\u00ad cepted, as a matter of fact. It was accepted. Mr. LONG. Senator, all we are asking for here is to continue some programs that face an immediate loss of funding. Mr. JAVITS. I think this is also an ex\u00ad piring program. Mr. LONG. If so, it might be included in what we have. But it would be all right with me for it to be in order for the Sena\u00ad tor to offer his amendment if it is to ex\u00ad tend an expiring program. Mr. JAVITS. Will the Senator agree that if it does continue an expiring pro\u00ad gram, then I will be permitted to offer it on this legislation, but if not, then I will be permitted to off er it on the main bill? Is that all right? Mr. LONG. Yes. Mr. METZENBAUM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do not know that I will object, will the majority leader be good enough to tell us what H.R. 3091 is? It is not on the calendar, and I do not know what it contains. Mr. LONG. Mr. President, it is a bill on the tax treatment of travel expenses of State legislators. Mr. METZENBAUM. Will the chair\u00ad man of the Finance Committee be good enough to explain what he is proposing by this legislation? I do not recollect, Did we pass it last year or this year? Mr. LONG. Yes; we passed it last year. Mr. METZENBAUM. I do not have any specific recollection of it. Will the Senator be good enough to explain what it contains? Mr. LONG. I am not asking the Sen\u00ad ator to vote for the bill; I am just ask\u00ad ing to get it to a vote. Mr. METZENBAUM. I understand. Mr. LONG. It extends, for 1 addition-March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENA TE 6589 al year, the effective date for the tax treatment of travel expenses incurred by State legislators while away from home to taxable years beginning before Jan\u00ad uary l, 1979. Generally, under present law, an in\u00ad dividual's \"tax home\" is determined by a number of factors. This situation some\u00ad times has led to uncertainty and awk\u00ad ward results, especially in the case of State legislators. The bill allows a State legislator to treat his place of residence within his legislative district as his \"tax home\" for purposes of computing income tax deduc\u00ad tions while away from home. The bill also allows State legislators to deduct ordinary and necessary business travel expenses similar to those allowed to in\u00ad dividuals in other trades or businesses. The provision which the bill extends in\u00ad itially was enacted in 1976, and subse\u00ad quently has been extended two times. Without a further extension, State leg\u00ad islators will have to file their income tax returns for 1978 under the general rules for determining the location of an in\u00ad dividual's \"tax home.\" Mr. METZENBAUM. I have no objec\u00ad tion. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the Senator from West Virginia? Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me suggest that I share the views expressed by the dis\u00ad tinguished chairman. What we are try\u00ad ing to do here is accommodate Ambassa\u00ad dor Strauss. He has a deadline on when the countervailing duty waiver bill should be passed. Some of us have an amendment on carryover bases. We have agreed not to try to load the counter\u00ad vailing duty waiver bill up with amend\u00ad ments. This agreement would satisfy us, but I would make one exception. We can do it with the agreement, I would as\u00ad sume, that if any amendments are adopted, other amendments will be in order. I do not want this one adopted; I hope we can table it. Mr. LONG. I would hope the Senator would be willing to withhold his amend\u00ad ments on this bill. Mr. DOLE. I do not intend to offer it unless other amendments are offered. Mr. LONG. If other amendments are agreed to, then you would be free to of\u00ad fer yours; that is fair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent re\u00ad quest? Without objection, it is so ordered. ORDER FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3091 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the disposition of the countervailing duties bill, the Senate proceed to the considera\u00ad tion of H.R. 3091, which order already has been entered; that it be considered as having been read the :first and second times, and that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I thank all Senators. TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF COUN\u00ad TERVAILING DUTY WAIVER AU\u00ad THORITY Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of the countervailing duty waiver bill, H.R. 1147, with a limitation of 1 hour on the bill, to be divided between the Senator from Louisiana <Mr. LoNG) and the Senator from Kansas <Mr. DOLE) ; that no amendments be in order, but that there be a time limitation on any de\u00ad batable motion, appeal, or point of order, if such is submitted to the Senate, of 30 minutes, and that the agreement be in the usual form. Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I very much hope this unanimous-con\u00ad sent request will be granted. I would ask the majority leader, how\u00ad ever, what his intentions are with respect to the next item to be presented to the Senate. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator indulge me for just a moment? It would be the intention of the leadership, following the action on the countervailing duty waiver bill, to pro\u00ad ceed with H.R. 3091. Mr. BAKER. What after that? Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. After that, if possible, to get to the Rhodesia resolu\u00ad tion. I understand that can be quickly done; there is already a time agreement on it. Then following that we would take up the resolution offered by the distin\u00ad guished Senator from North Carolina <Mr. MORGAN) and the distinguished Senator from Connecticut <Mr. WEICKER). Mr. BAKER. I thank the majority leader. Mr. MELCHER. Mr. President, reserv\u00ad ing the right to object, might I inquire of the majority leader if the unanimous\u00ad consent request he is making now refers to the countervailing duty bill? Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Yes. Mr. MELCHER. Mr. President, at this point I would have to object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection to the unanimous-consent request is heard. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, let me say respectfully that the Senator from Montana indicated to me earlier that for the time being he would have to object. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of the countervailing duty waiver bill. This is without the time limitation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The bill will be stated by title. The legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 1147) to extend temporarily the authority of the Secretary of the Treas\u00ad ury to waive the imposition of the counter\u00ad vailing duties, The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to its consideration. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized. Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, on March 22, the Committee on Finance ordered favorably reported this bill, H.R. 1147, to extend temporarily the authority of the Secretary of the Treas\u00ad ury to waive the imposition of counter\u00ad vailing duties. The committee did this in order to remove a procedural obstacle to the completion of the 4-year-old multilateral trade negotiations which are being concluded in Geneva. By re\u00ad moving this obstacle, the Congress will have the opportunity to consider the results of the trade negotiations. A little background may put this issue into perspective. Under present law, the Secretary of the Treasury is required to impose countervailing duties on imports of products on which he determines a subsidy is being paid by foreign govern\u00ad ments. The countervailing duty is im\u00ad posed in addition to regular duties and is equal to the net amount of the sub\u00ad sidy and is intended to offset the ad\u00ad vantage afforded by the foreign subsidy practice. In the Trade Act of 1974, Congress directed the President to seek new in\u00ad ternational rules on subsidy practices in the multilateral trade negotiations. To permit the President to avoid con\u00ad frontations over the U.S. countervailing duty law, which was considered by many of our trading partners to be incon\u00ad sistent with U.S. international obliga\u00ad tions, and to create an international climate conducive to negotiating a sub\u00ad sidies code, Congress provided the Sec\u00ad retary of the Treasury temporary au\u00ad thority for 4 years, until January 3, 1979, to waive countervailing duties; that is, not impose and collect them even though a subsidy exist if he determines certain conditions were met. The negotiations have not been con\u00ad cluded, but the waiver authority has ex\u00ad pired. About a year ago, the European communities, one of the major negotiat\u00ad ing parties participating in the multi\u00ad lateral trade negotiations, indicated that it would not conclude the multi\u00ad lateral trade negotiations in terms of formal approval of the agreements until Congress insures the continued applica\u00ad tion of the waiver authority for the peri\u00ad od of time necessary to conclude the negotiations and for Congress to consider the results. The extension of the countervailing duty waiver authority is a political issue with the Europeans, a symbolic issue about which they feel very strongly. The European communities believe that the United States has been improperly using its countervailing duty law in the past against their products, a view with which I disagree, strongly. However, the communities claim that the existence of the waiver has permitted it to negotiate a code on subsidies and countervailing duties, a code important to U.S. interests. About half the imports of products now covered by waivers come from the Eu\u00ad ropean communities, including dairy products, Danish canned hains, and but\u00ad ter cookies. Let us understand clearly what this bill does. It is based on a bill which passed the Senate last session. It is a temporary extension of the waiver authority for a maximum period of 9 months. It affects approximately $600 million worth of U.S. 6540 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE March 28, 1979 imports out of total imports of $150 bil\u00ad lion, and could result in the waiver of no more than $30 million in duties. The exercise of the waiver authority would still be subject to all the terms and con\u00ad ditions that Congress wrote in the Trade Act of 1974 as safeguards against the abuse of this power. Thus, a waiver could not be exercised unless the foreign government has taken adequate steps to reduce substantially or eliminate the adverse effect of the sub\u00ad sidy. If Congress does not agree with the exercise of the waiver authority in a par\u00ad ticular case, it may override the action by the adoption in either House of Con\u00ad gress of a resolution disproving such waiver determination. The committee expects vigorous enforcement of the con\u00ad ditions for granting a waiver in order to protect domestic producing interests from the adverse effects of subsidized competition. Further, the committee ex\u00ad pects that exercise of the extended waiver authority in any new cases not al\u00ad ready subject to waiver as of January 2, 1979, would apply only perspectively from the date the Secretary determines the waiver conditions have been met. Mr. President, this bill will permit Congress to consider the results of the multilateral trade negotiations. If Con\u00ad gress does not approve the agreements, then it may reject them. Such rejection would terminate the waiver extension automatically. I have not made up my mind personally on whether the results of the multilateral trade negotiations should be approved by Congress. How\u00ad ever, based on the intensive consulta\u00ad tions which have been going on recently with the administration, I believe there is a good chance that what the adminis\u00ad tration sends to us in the way of agree\u00ad ments and an implementing bill would be something that, on balance, the Sen\u00ad ate may want to support as being in the national interest. I believe, Mr. Presi\u00ad dent, that without this extension of the countervailing duty waiver authority, Congress will never have the oppor\u00ad tunity to evaluate the results of the negotiations. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the following Finance Com\u00ad mittee staff be granted the privilege of the floor during the consideration of H.R. 1147 and H.R. 3901: Michael Stern, Bob Cassidy, David Foster, Bill Finan, Joe Humphreys, Bill Galvin, Bill Morris, Ed Hawkins. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MATSUNAGA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a member of my staff, Edwin Ing, be granted the privi\u00ad lege of the floor during consideration of the pending bill and votes thereon. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I believe the Senate should act affirmatively on H.R. 1147. I agree with the statement just made by my distinguished colleague <Mr. RrnrcoFF ). As the Senator from Kansas indicated a few moments ago, it is cru\u00ad cial-at least, I have been persuaded by Ambassador Strauss that it is crucial that we pass this legislation very quickly, that we do not encumber it with a num-ber of amendments. This Senator cer\u00ad tainly is willing to accommodate Ambas\u00ad sador Strauss, who, in my view, has done an outstanding job and deserves consid\u00ad eration. When he tells me that the dead\u00ad line is April 2 or April 3, I want to try to help them meet that deadline. I hope we do not encumber this meas\u00ad ure with amendments. The Senator from Kansas and the distinguished Senator from Virginia (Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR.) had an amendment which we felt de\u00ad served consideration. We were persuaded not to offer it to this legislation. By agreement with the distinguished chair\u00ad man of the Committee on Finance, we have now a unanimous-consent agree\u00ad ment that we might call that up later. Having said that I support the exten\u00ad sion, on the basis that it is necessary in order to assure that Congress will have the opportunity to judge the results of 5 years of international trade negotiations. In any sense, I regret the need for this legislation. It is disappointing that the administration apparently could not con\u00ad clude the trade negotiations without this temporary waiver of the application of our countervailing duty law to certain subsidized products of foreign countries. Nevertheless, as I have indicated, I think we must accept Ambassador Strauss' word, when he tells us that this bill is vital to completion of the trade negotiations. I want to emphasize that approval of H.R. 1147 will in no way signify approval of the trade agreements package nego\u00ad tiated in the MTN. Most of us have not made up our minds on that package which is complex and as yet not complete. In the Finance Committee, we are now scrutinizing that package and trying to develop appropriate legislation in con\u00ad sultations with the executive branch. I personally hope that the trade agree\u00ad ments package and the steps taken in the implementing bill will merit the support of Members on both sides of the aisle. I cannot make that judgment at this time, nor is the Senate asked to do so. Theim\u00ad portant point is that approval of H.R. 1147 is necessary if we are to have the op\u00ad portunity later this year to judge agree\u00ad ments and new legislation potentially af\u00ad fecting billions of dollars in U.S. exports and imports. Mr. President, I am of the opinion that we should move very quickly. I\u00b7 am cer\u00ad tainly willing to support this legislation. I yield the floor to the distinguished Senator from Maine. Mr. COHEN. I would like to take this opportunity to express my views on how this legislation is likely to affect my own State of Maine. Trade is very important to Maine. Maine is the leading exporter of leather and leather products, and a large ex\u00ad porter of paper products, electric equip\u00ad ment, and sardines. A recent Department of Commerce study has estimated that 4,200 jobs in Maine in 1976 were directly related to producing exports of manu\u00ad factured goods. An additional 3,500 Maine jobs were required to produce ma\u00ad terials and parts for incorporation in products exported from the other 49 States. This totals 7,700 jobs related to exports in manufacturing alone, which are important, at least, for the State of Maine. This does not include the jobs re\u00ad lated to agricultural exports, which are also important. While the exports of these industries are very important to the economy of the State, other Maine industries are suffer\u00ad ing because of the unfair trading prac\u00ad tices of some major trading partners. The industry that particularly con\u00ad cerns me today is the fishing industry. Maine fishermen have been severely hurt, being forced to compete with the Cana\u00ad dian fishing industry, which is heavily subsidized by the c~nadian Government. The Maine fishermen, along with other affected fishermen in the United States, have been forced to file a petition with the U.S. Treasury Department to have their case reviewed. Their goal was to have a countervailing duty applied to offset the Canadian subsidy and to im\u00ad prove their own competitive position. But the countervailing duties are not being paid; they have been waived by the Treasury Department. The fishermen feel that the Treasury Department failed to determine the full extent of the subsidy. This legislation to continue the author\u00ad ity of the Treasury Department to waive countervailing duties would mean that Maine fishermen would continue to have no recourse to offset the advantage that the subsidized Canadian industry has in the marketplace. For that reason, I can\u00ad not support the extension of this author\u00ad ity in the absence of any administration assurances to the fishing industry that the Federal Government will take prompt, firm and effective action to al\u00ad leviate the present market problems caused by Canadian imports. I appreciate the Senator from Kansas expressing his confidence with Ambassa\u00ad dor Strauss that this legislation is im\u00ad portant, if we are able to sign agree\u00ad ments now underway, or the negotia\u00ad tions underway, in Geneva. I know we are apt to get carried away with how the EEC's attitude will be af\u00ad fected toward the MTN. I would like to look behind those acronyms and code words toward human problems of people I represent. In congressional discussions of trade policy it is easy to become lost in the theoretical economic arguments which must be posed and analyzed, and to get carried away with the catch phrases and acronyms which surround the relevant issues. As a result, we frequently for get the human dimensions of the problems which confront us. Such a situation is developing as we discuss countervailing duties. We point to the possible affect that failure to pass this bill will have on the \"EEC's\" attitude toward the \"MTN.\" For a moment, I would like to ask the administration to put aside its code words and, at the very least, to acknowledge what members of one affected group-Maine fishermen\u00ad think when they hear the phrase \"waiver of countervailing duties.\" The mental picture which appears is that of the marketplace in Boston where potential buyers of Maine fish refuse to bid because they know that a shipment of Canadian fish is on the way. They actu-March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 6541 ally step back when the auctioneer asks for buyers to speak up. All too often the result of this action is spoiled fl.sh, or fl.sh sold at a price below the amount spent to harvest it. Anger and frustration inevitably will be experienced by the fishing community of my State, and I suspect of all the New England States, as well. I wish to make clear that I intend to keep an open mind in deciding the merits of the agreements coming out of the Geneva trade talks. Further, I will care\u00ad fully examine the subsidy/countervailing duty code as well as the other agree\u00ad ments which may have a potential im\u00ad pact on Maine industries. However, I will not agree to the administration's desires with respect to a countervailing duty waiver as long as the administration re\u00ad fuses to acknowledge the anger and frus\u00ad tration and inequity of my fishermen in the State of Maine and the urgent need for sympathetic action which will bring fairness to their marketplace. I thank the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas. Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Maine. I might add that many arguments raised by the Senator from Maine were raised in the committee, and we will continue to raise those same arguments when it involves a domestic industry. It has been suggested we are being, in effect, blackjacked by the Common Market countries who say, in effect, that if we do not extend the countervailing duty waiver authority there will be no trade agreement . That does not say much for their ef\u00ad forts. It does not appeal to this Senator, or the Finance Committee, and we take a dim view of threats such as that. But we do believe in this case, where Ambassador Strauss indicated willing\u00ad ness to work with the committee to solve some problems raised by the distin\u00ad guished Senator from Maine and the rest of us, that we should give him that au\u00ad thority. It is on that basis the Senator from Kansas and most members of the com\u00ad mittee are willing to support the legis\u00ad lation. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The second assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unani\u00ad mous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, while we are waiting for the distinguished Senator from Montana. I would like to make a statement. Mr. President, last week the Depart\u00ad ment of Commerce announced that in 1978 the United States had its largest trade deficit in history. The United States imported $34 b11lion more in mer\u00ad chandise than we exported. These enormous numbers stand as a sober backdrop to our consideration of the M'IN package and implementing legislation. We must be tough minded. I do not suggest that we reject the new trade agreement simply because some concessions must be granted to foreign countries, but we must be certain that we will get at least as much as we are giving. The new laws must assure that we can act vigorously against unfair for\u00ad eign practices which increase our im\u00ad ports and limit our exports. I have no illusions that the trade agreements package, by itself, would re\u00ad verse our trade deficit. We must also, at this time, examine other means of in\u00ad creasing our exports_. I doubt that any other country ties the hands of its farmers and businessmen with more regulations against exports. Indeed, the governments of most of our major com\u00ad petitors are encouraging exports with a variety of means that we could emulate without violating any international rules. American industry and agricul\u00ad ture can compete with anybody, if their government is ready to help rather than hinder our exports. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of ~.quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk pro\u00ad ceeded to call the roll. Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, I think we are ready for third reading. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there amendments to the bill? Mr. MATSUNAGA addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen\u00ad ator from Hawaii. Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, may we have third reading? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is open to amendment. If there be no amendment to be offered, the question is on the third reading and passage of the bill. The bill <H.R. 1147) was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time. Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on final passage. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. Mr. MATSUNAGA. Mr. President, I well realize that the passage of this bill is considered a prerequisite to the success\u00ad ful conclusion of the multilateral nego\u00ad tiations in Geneva. The administration has predicted serious disruptive conse\u00ad quences if the multilateral trade negotia\u00ad tions are not brought to a successful con\u00ad clusion. In my position as chief deputy ma\u00ad jority whip and as a member of the Democratic Party, I have consistently supported the President. However, the special trade representative's ofl\\ce has acted to reduce the tariff protection for a vital Hawaiian industry, and the secre\u00ad tive, uncooperative position taken by oui trade representatives, greatly strains my basic goodwill toward the administra\u00ad tion. The problem first surfaced in Decem\u00ad ber of 1978, when, just by chance, I learned that the U.S. delegation to the multilateral trade negotiations received authority to offer a concession on pine\u00ad apple and pineapple juice, in response to a request from the Philippines. After learning of this, I immediately wrote to Ambassador Alonzo L. McDonald, the head of the U.S. delegation in Geneva, expressing concern and urging him to re\u00ad ject any tariff reduction which would undermine the economic viability of the pineapple industry in Hawaii. I pointed out that a tariff reduction from 3 percent to 1 percent ad valorem would jeopardize the second largest cash crop in the State of Hawaii. On January 10, 1979, I took up this matter in a letter addressed to Ambas\u00ad sador Strauss, U.S. special representa\u00ad tive for trade negotiations. On Febru\u00ad ary 5, 1979, I personally talked with Ambassador Strauss about the matter. In addition, I joined John Tolan, executive vice president of the Pineapple Growers Association of Hawaii, in testi\u00ad fying before the Senate Finance Sub\u00ad committee on International Trade, on February 22, 1979. We both underscored the importance of the pineapple industry to the Hawaiian economy and urged committee action against the possible reduction in tariff on imported processed pineapples and pineapple jui:::e. However, the U.S. delegation in Ge\u00ad neva and the special trade representa\u00ad tive continued to maintain that the tariff reduction would have a minimal impact on U.S. interest. They argued that a tariff reduction of 2 percent phased in over 8 years would be very small and at the same time would also benefit two multinational corporations which have operations abroad and import processed pineapple into the United States. However, their arguments overlooked the top priority given to the proposed tariff reduction by the Philippines and Thailand. These two countries viewed the tariff reduction as crucial. Moreover, the position of the special trade repre\u00ad sentatives' office while focusing on U.S. business abroad, overlooked the vital role pineapple serves in the Hawaiian e:::on\u00ad omy. As I stated before, the Senate Finance Subcommittee on International Trade, the industry in Hawaii provides year-round employment for 4,200 work\u00ad ers and seasonal employment for an additional 8,000 workers during the sum\u00ad mer months. Wages to pineapple work\u00ad ers have contributed $50 million annually to the Hawaiian economy; pur\u00ad chases of equipment and materials in the local economy have added another $43 million annually. Last year, the Hawaiian industry paid $7.2 million in Federal, State, and county taxes. Despite this contribution to Hawaii, the industry faces a tenuous future, because of the ever increasing foreign competition due to cheap labor. Having failed to obtain a satisfactory response from the U.S. delegation in Geneva and the special trade repreaenta\u00ad tive, I decided to take up this matter per-6542 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE March 28, 1979 sonally with President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines. On March 15, 1979, while on a brief visit in Manila, I met and pleaded with President Marcos to withdraw the Philippine's demand for a reduction in U.S. tariff on imported proc\u00ad essed pineapple and pineapple juice. I pointed out that the reduction in ta-riff in the long run would lead to a flood of pine.tpple from Thailand and Mexico; these outside sources would not only wipe out the Hawaiian industry but also en\u00ad danger Philippine exports into the United States. I also pointed out that the Hawaiian pineapple industry has provided employ\u00ad ment for a large number of immigrants from the Philippines and the destruction of this industry would work a great hard\u00ad ship on many of these people. Acting on my proposal, President Marcos stated that the Philippines would not object to the U.S. retention of the present duty on processed pineapple. However, on my return to the United States, I learned that the U.S. delegation had offered to reduce the tariff on pine\u00ad apple juice, as well as the tariff on solid pineapple. The off er was included in the U.S. closeout agreement with the Philip\u00ad pines, which had been concluded on an ad referendum basis prior to my trip to the Philippines. In all my contacts with the special trade representative's omce, no mention had been made of tariff re\u00ad duction on pineapple juice. Despite the crucial interest of Hawaii at stake, the special trade representative's omce failed to inform me of their prior agreement to reduce the tariff on pineapple juice by as much as 50 percent. It was stated that the U.S. delegation had acted after consultation with the interagency advisory committee com\u00ad prised of representatives from the State Department, the Treasury Department, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Agriculture. It was also stated that the interagency advisory committee had analyzed the economic impact of the tariff reduction and con\u00ad cluded that the reduction would have minimal impact on the domestic pine\u00ad apple industry. It was also stated that the U.S. delegation had acted after con\u00ad sultation with the private industry Agri\u00ad culture Technical Advisory Committee for fruits and vegetables. However, upon further probing, I learned that the administration ofiicials had very little data on which their deci\u00ad sion was based. In addition, I also learned that the Private Industry Advisory Com\u00ad mittee was not consulted on this issue. When the Private Industry Advisory Committee reviewed the proposed close\u00ad out agreement with the Philippines, the committee formally stated its objection to the pineapple concessions. The com\u00ad mittee also adopted a resolution urging that the tariffs on pineapple products be retained at present levels. Furthermore, representatives of the two international companies involved have both expressed grave alarm over the pineapple juice concession. They have categorically stated that they were ignorant of any such intention by the U.S. delegation in Geneva to make such concessions. They were never consulted as to the potential impact such action would have on their Hawaiian opera\u00ad tions. At this point, both companies have registered their objection to the reduc\u00ad tion in tariff. The International Long\u00ad shoremen's and Warehousemen's Union which represents pineapple workers in Hawaii, has also registered its objections. The Governor of Hawaii has cabled the President, expressing grave alarm over this action. Both Houses of the Hawaii State Legislature have passed resolutions urging the retention of the present level of tariff protection. Nonetheless, the U.S. delegation in Geneva and the special trade represent\u00ad ative's omce persist in seeking foreign concessions in return for U.S. reduction of the tariff on processed pineapple and pineapple juices. Indeed, the U.S. dele\u00ad gation has informed me that they in\u00ad terpret President Marco's statement as merely inviting the United States to re\u00ad open the negotiations with the Philip\u00ad pines. The U.S. delegation has indicated that it is unwilling to reopen its nego\u00ad tiations and will hold the Philippines to its close-out offer. Mr. President, in my more than 16 years in the Congress I have never risen in anger and do not ever intend to do so, but the willful, almost surreptitious ac\u00ad tion by the U.S. delegation in Geneva and the special trade representative's of\u00ad fice in using pineapple as a pawn dis\u00ad turbs me to no end. As part of the Senate leadership and as a loyal Democratic Party member, I shall vote for the pas\u00ad sage of the countervailing duty waiver authority, because I believe the Presi\u00ad dent needs it to act in the best interest of our country. However, I will cast my vote with extreme disillusionment and loss of faith in the administration's con\u00ad duct of the Geneva negotiations. Mr. President. I yield the floor. (Mr. MATSUNAGA assumed the chair.) The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized. Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I wish to rise to add my voice and support to the eloquent statement that wa<> just made from my distinguished colleague, the Senator from Hawaii. A couple of weeks ago at this desk and on this floor I called like attention to the failures of the Geneva talks with re\u00ad gard to other agricultural products in other parts of the United States. At this moment I have not made a determination as to how I will vote on this particular matter. It seems to me like somewhere along the line we are going to have to send a message very loud and very clear to the administration that we do not feel that the interests of the American food producers are being adequately pro\u00ad tected. I cite once again the fact that for many years now our friend Switzerland has been subsidizing their domestic wheat producers to the tune of $11 a bushel and in the Common Market coun\u00ad tries domestic production of wheat is subsidized by those governments from between $5.50 and $7 a bushel. And with our allies the Japanese it is well known and documented that food\u00ad stuffs produced here are multiplied by two or three times before they are pumped into the Japanese economy. I, therefore, say it is about time that we strengthen our back and send a mes\u00ad sage to the world that America cannot continue its international cheap-food policy if we are ever going to have a chance at balancing our serious deficit of international trade that we all know has reached record proportions. So I compliment my colleague from Hawaii for his very fine statement. At this moment I am not sure that I am going to go as far as he has gone. Maybe this is in the interest of the United States of America to give the adminis\u00ad tration another chance to do what they say they might be able to do with the ex\u00ad tension of the act as is being suggested. Nevertheless, I want it shown in the RECORD that I think there are many of us in the Chamber of the Senate who are not pleased with the less than aggressive attitude that we have taken in the Geneva negotiations and particularly the Tokyo rounds. Thank you very much. Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, it is my understanding there is no further re\u00ad quest for time and I think we are ready to vote. Mr. President, will the Chair with\u00ad hold the yeas and nays? The distin\u00ad guished Senator from Maine <Mr. MUSKIE) has a short statement to make. The PRESIDING OFFICER <Mr. ExoN). The Chair recognizes the Sena\u00ad tor from Maine. Mr. MUSKIE. I thank my good friend from Connecticut, the floor manager of this bill. Mr. President, I have been waltching with some interest recent developments as we seek to conclude the multilateral trade agreement. I supported the effort we made in the 1974 Trade Act, to give the President the flexibility he needs to negotiate trading agreements with other nations. But I also supported the effort the Senate made in that legislation, which seeks to protect the essential interests of Amer\u00ad ican industries. The countervailing duty provisions of that legislation were carefully drawn to give the Treasury Department flexibility to respond positively to other govern\u00ad ments, when they chose to reduce export subsidies. But these provisions were not intended to strip all protection from domestic industries. The Congress never indicated any willingness to forego the basic principles embodied in the coun\u00ad tervailing duty language: To protect domestic industry against unfair sub\u00ad sidized competition from abroad. I am, therefore, concerned about the manner in which the waiver authority has been utilized in recent periods. The recent action by the Treasury Department, to waive countervailing duties on Canadian fish imports, was reached on the basis of a relatively minor adjustment in a direct subsidy payment the Canadian Government makes on fish exports. The reduction in the direct subsidy is welcome. March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 6543 But alone, it does nothing to eliminate the competitive advantage that the deep Canadian subsidy of the Canadian fish\u00ad ing industry gives that industry. I have a particular interest in it in connection with the New England fish\u00ad ing industry. The New England fishing industry has suffered substantial and continuing damage from that subsidized competi\u00ad tion. I hope the recent agreement reached with the Canadian Government on fish\u00ad eries will help reintroduce a more equit\u00ad able and more orderly market share re\u00ad lationship in the fishing industry on both sides of the border. But in the meantime, the continua\u00ad tion of the deep subsidy the Canadian industry enjoys is doing serious damage to our domestic fisheries. Today, Maine fishermen sending their catch to the Boston markets are placed in the position of knowing that if a Ca\u00ad nadian truckload of fish is on the way, their catch will not be sold. This is in\u00ad tolerable. I am concerned that the Treasury De\u00ad partment has made little effort to re\u00ad spond positively to this position. I am disturbed by the use made of this waiver authority in the case of the fish\u00ad ing industry. And I believe Congress should reiter\u00ad ate its position: That the basic principles on which the creation of the counter\u00ad vailing duty language was developed, are not principles that can be disregarded as we move nearer to considering a mul\u00ad tilateral trade agreement. I share the concerns expressed by my colleague from Maine regarding this leg\u00ad islation. The argument advanced by pro\u00ad ponents of this bill that we must enact it to permit conclusion of the multilat\u00ad eral trade negotiations is not particu\u00ad larly persuasive when I consider the like\u00ad ly impact of those negotiations on in\u00ad dustry in my State and my region. I will, therefore, vote against passage of H.R. 1147, the extension of the coun\u00ad tervailing duties waiver authority. I thank my good friend from Connecti\u00ad cut for giving me the time to make the statement. Mr. MELCHER addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Montana. Mr. MELCHER. Mr. President, extend\u00ad ing the time period under which the Secretary of the Treasury has the au\u00ad thority to waive countervailing duties on subsidized imports does not make sense now. It is a clear case of putting the cart before the horse. When this waiver was first authorized by Congress as part of the 197 4 Trade Act, it was clearly intended to provide an incentive to our trading partners-par\u00ad ticularly our European trading part\u00ad ners-to negotiate a new, more equitable, multilateral trade agreement governing the use of export subsidies, Government procurement practices, tariffs, safe\u00ad guards, and product standards, among other areas, prior to January of this year. This has not been accomplished. And now the Common Market countries are telling us that if we do not further extend the waiver of countervailing duties, they will not agree on a new multilateral agreement. I think it is time to respond to such demands by telling them that we have gone as far as we intend to go in coax\u00ad ing them to negotiate these matters with us. What if we do not get a new agree\u00ad ment? We make up something like 35 percent of the total amount of trade among GATT members. What can they do without us? We do not even know if the agreement now coming out of Geneva is even in our benefit. Evidence is begin\u00ad ning to indicate that it may well be a continuation of bad trade policy for the United States. The administration has consistently stated that the real benefits for the United States from this agreement do not come from changes in tariffs, but from what we are getting in the non tariff areas. They Congressional Budget Of\u00ad fice in March 1979 estimated that the gain or los.:; to the United States of the new tariff agreements will not be more than $1 billion-at a time when we are running better than a $30 billion a year trade deficit. If there are to be any sig\u00ad nificant gains they will have to come in the nontariff areas. Let us look at a couple of these areas. One important section of the treaty deals with the question of safeguards for our domestic industries that are injured by excessive imports. Now this is important. I have personal knowledge of this. In Montana we have over 2,500 copper workers unemployed because of copper imports. The United States has put forward very moderate language for a new safe\u00ad guards code. As I understand it, it simply calls for negotiations between the ex\u00ad porting and importing countries and then if no agreement can be reached within a specified time, the dispute would be arbitrated by an international panel of GATT signatories. But the Common Market refuses to go along with this language. They continue to insist that they have the unilateral right to impose selective import barriers whenever and however they feel like it. They do not want to go through open and formal GATT procedures. Why? Because they do not think it is to their benefit. They have a better deal now. According to Richard Mathieson of the special trade representative's office, whose job it is to negotiate the safe\u00ad guards portion of the agreement, the rest of the GA TT members would likely go along with the U.S. language-but the Nordic and Common Market coun\u00ad tries refuse. As a result, there is a very good chance that there may be no safe\u00ad guards code at all in the agreement. A \"subsidies code\" is another impor\u00ad tant nontariff area. But whether it will be workable or of any value is an open question. For example, in agricultural commodities there continues to be open disagreement in the world press as to what the subsidies code will do. U.S. spokesmen claim that it will stop subsi\u00ad dies by the Common Market countries to agricultural producers. The Europeans disagree completely. The truth of the matter appears to be that the final Ian-guage for the \"subsidy code'' will prob\u00ad ably be so vague that it will be meaning\u00ad less. That will leave the European coun\u00ad tries still selling their products at sub\u00ad sidized low prices to capture our market. Another area of the subsidies code that is less than satisfactory is the \"injury test\" conditions. This is another European demand that our negotiators gave in to. We do not need an injury test in dealing with admittedly unfair trade practices if what we all want is \"free trade.\" I have never heard free trade defined as including Government subsidies for exports. Adam Smith would turn in his grave at the thought of it. But the Europeans demand an injury test obviously to delay any protective actions on the part of the U.S. Govern\u00ad ment. That is clearly continuation of the same old one-way trade policy we have where they have access to our markets and keep our products out. This brings us back to the question of this legislation. We are being asked\u00ad or rather ordered-to extend favorable treatment to our trading partners\u00ad primarily the Common Market in this instance-without any assurances that it will be to the benefit of the American people. I think that the Senate should refuse to extend this waiver until we have had a chance to see the final terms of the new agreement. This would provide a lot more incentive to the countries involved to get down to the business of negotiat\u00ad ing a fair tniding agreement than to con\u00ad stantly give in to their every demand. If we want \"free trade\" then we must have reciprocal and equal rights with the Europeans and Japan-not one-way deals, not dumping, and definitely not buying their products, unless they buy ours. We do not have \"free trade\" now\u00ad they have the only \"free\" part of it and then block us out or buy cheaP-Such as our wheat-and add to the price in sell\u00ad ing to their consumers making profits that our own wheat farmers should have. We do not have fair and reciprocal trade when the duty on imported cars we have is one-fifth or one-quarter of the duty they charge on American cars. We do not need to continue these fool\u00ad ish trade policies that turn Uncle Sam into Uncle Sucker. e Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as ranking Republican member of the International Trade Subcommittee, I support passage of H.R.1147. On its face, this bill provides for an extension of the Secretary of the Treas\u00ad ury's authority to waiver countervailing duties. However, the bill represents much more than that. Very simply stated, it represents the final hurdle for us to clear before we will have the opporttinity to decide whether or not the United States should participate in the most ambitious trade agreements negotiated in over 30 years. In fact, our action on this bill could well determine whether any of our trade partners will be able to participate in the agreements. As Ambassador Strauss has stated, if we do not extend the waiver authority, the E.C. will not enter into the agreements which in turn will lead to a complete unraveling of the negotiations. These potential ramifica-6544 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE March 28, 1979 tions certainly require a global perspec\u00ad tive in the deliberation of this issue. I have not yet made up my mind re\u00ad garding the MTN itself. There are some new opportunities, but there have also been some major disappointments. Much depends on the final shape of the imple\u00ad menting legislation. If the United States is properly organized to defend its inter\u00ad ests and rights under the MTN, our par\u00ad ticipation in the new codes may well be of benefit. If not, other countries will be in a much better position to take advan\u00ad tage of the codes and new trade rules than the United States will be. That is why I believe it is aibsolutely essential the implementing legislation include a commitment by the adminis\u00ad tration to help Congress establish a new Department of International Trade and Investment. At the present time, we in the Finance Committee and other committees of ju\u00ad risdiction are making recommendations to try to write the best possible imple\u00ad menting legislation. We may not be suc\u00ad cessful in our efforts, but I believe we should have the opportunity to see. Con\u00ad gress can then judge whether the imple\u00ad menting legislation is good enough or not. But without the countervailing duty waiver extension, we will not even have the opportunity to make this judgment. I do not think I am alone in express\u00ad ing a deep resentment that the commu\u00ad nity would use such a minor issue as the waiver of countervailing duties (annu\u00ad ally worth about $47 million) as an ex\u00ad cuse for not entering into the trade agreements. The Tokyo round of nego\u00ad tiations has involved 5 years, the work of thousands of people, and some im\u00ad mensely important decisions. To threat\u00ad en a pull-out because the United States fails to continue waiving countervailing duties demonstrates a lack of responsi\u00ad bility on the part of the E.C., not only to the people within its boundaries, but to the people of all those nations who should be given the opportunity to ana\u00ad lyze the agreements and decide what di\u00ad rection international trade should take in the decades to come. The need to make such decisions far outweighs any small benefit that the extension of the waiver authority may hold for the Europeans. Mr. President, I call upon my col\u00ad leagues to demonstrate the responsibility and global perspective that the Euro\u00ad peans seem to lack but which has been the hallmark of American trade policy in this century. We must give the Ameri\u00ad can people, as well as the rest of the world, the opportunity to consider the MTN agreements. Today, we can either present the world with the options that the MTN offers, or we can close the book on the negotiations. I, for one, want to consider the options that may lead us to a fairer and more open international trading system. Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I sup\u00ad port this measure which would extend the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to waive the application of countervailing duties. The Trade Act of 1974 authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to waive the application of countervailing duties for a 4-year period to encourage completion of the multilateral trade negotiations (MTN) . This authority expired Jan\u00ad uary 2, 1979 and the negotiations are not yet completed. The United States wm gain much in terms of export opportuni\u00ad ties for our industrial and agricultural products from this agreement. Passage of this extension of authority does not in any way prejudge the merits or demerits of the MTN package. It does not condone foreign subsidy practices or other unfair trade practices. This is a procedural matter but an important one-without it the Congress will not have opportunity to consider the agree\u00ad ments themselves. Extension of the waiver authority, which will send a signal to the Europeans that the United States wishes to :om\u00ad plete the multilateral trade negotiations, is supported by a broad range of indus\u00ad tries and associations. The House of Rep\u00ad resentatives passed this extension over\u00ad whelmingly and without amendments. I urge the Senate to support extension of the waiver authority so that the Congress and the American people can judge for themselves the fruits of the Tokyo round. Mr. HEINZ. Mr. President, when this legislation appeared before the Senate last October I opposed it in its original form and succeeded in amending it to provide for a significantly shorter exten\u00ad sion. As it turned out, however, the amendment was ultimately not enacted, despite being attached to two different bills. Although the extension's demise at that time was due to a variety of fac\u00ad tors in addition to my concerns, I con\u00ad fess I was not sorry to see it go. Nor am I particularly excited to see it return now, though it is not my intention to op\u00ad pose it this time. Last October I fought this extension for two reasons. First, negotiations on the subsidies code, to which it related, were not yet completed, and I saw no need to extend a significant concession with no real assurance that a code satis\u00ad factory to us would be developed. Second, I have had strong views for some time about the form MTN im\u00ad plementing legislation should take to in\u00ad sure that domestic industries have ade\u00ad quate opportunities to defend themselves against the unfair trading practices of other nations. In order to fully express those views, which are not in every detail shared by the administration, it is neces\u00ad sary to take advantage of every oppor\u00ad tunity to convince administration offi\u00ad cials of the need to draft a strong imple\u00ad menting bill. Extending countervailing duty waiver authority is just such an op\u00ad portunity, and withholding approval of it has proved to be a useful way to bring these concerns to the attention of our trade negotiators, and to make sure that congressiona 1. concerns about our trade policy are fully considered by the Presi\u00ad dent. The passage of time, however, has less\u00ad ened these concerns somewhat. The Subsidies Code is now virtually complete, and copies of it have been available to Congress for some time. It appears likely it will be signed, if this extension is en\u00ad acted. Moreover, the procedures the Fi\u00ad nance and Ways and Means Committees have adopted to consider the MTN codes insures a full measure of congressional input into the development of strong im\u00ad plementing legislation. Thus, in many respects, my concerns of last October have been satisfactorily resolved. The Finance Committee, in my judgment, has made significant prog\u00ad ress in recent weeks in developing strong MTN implementing legislation on the Subsidies Code. Specifically, a num\u00ad ber of us, notably Senators MoYNllIAN, DANFORTH, BENTSEN, and myself, have been working hard to develop: First, a standard of injury that American firms can easily meet: second, definitions of unfair trade practices that are broad and include both export and domestic sub\u00ad sidies; third, short time limits on investi\u00ad gations of unfair practices; fourth, pay\u00ad tnent of penalties and duties early in the investigation instead of at the end; fifth, increased transparency so American complainants will have full knowledge of the other side's case: and most impor\u00ad tantly, sixth, the creation of a Depart\u00ad ment of International Trade and Invest\u00ad ment, which will consolidate the many different trade-related agencies and take administration of unfair trade investiga\u00ad tions out of the hands of the Treasury Department, where it has been so badly handled. Whether the final product of the two committees will be acceptable on these points remains to be seen. I have no in\u00ad tention of supporting implementing leg\u00ad islation which is not satisfactory with respect to these concerns, but it is fair to say that at the present time some prog\u00ad ress is being made. In principle, it would be advantageous to withhold action on this extension until the final draft of the Subsidies Code im\u00ad plementing legislation is available, but it seems clear that there will be no final draft until the code is actually signed, which will not occur until this extension is adopted. Therefore, in order to facili\u00ad tate this process, I have decided not to oppose H.R. 1147. I want to make it clear, however, that my decision is prompted by my belief that the administration has acted in good faith in its negotiations with Senator MOYNIHAN and myself and other members of the Finance Commit\u00ad tee in developing implementing legisla\u00ad tion that satisfies our concerns. Should my belief prove to be incorrect, you can be sure I will oppose the MTN imple\u00ad menting legislation with all the resources I can muster. Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr\u00b7 President, I be\u00ad lieve we are ready to vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the bill pass? The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CRANSTON. I announce that the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. DURKIN) and the Senator from South Carolina <Mr. HOLLINGS) are necessarily absent. I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from New Hampshire <Mr. DURKIN) would vote \"nay.\" Mr. STEVENS. I announce that the March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 6545 Senator from Oregon <Mr. PACKWOOD) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any other Senator in the Chamber who wishes to vote?

ANNOUNCEMENT OF POSITION ON A VOTE\u00ad H.R. 1147 <The following proceedings occurred later.) Mr. DURKIN. Will the Senator yield for a brief explanation? Mr. LONG. Yes. Mr. DURKIN. I thank the Senator from Louisiana. Mr. President, I missed that last vote. I was at the White House discussing energy policy with a number of Members of the Senate and the House with the President as a prelude to his preparation of a speech next week. I missed the vote on passage of H.R. 1147, which would ex\u00ad tend the President's authority to waive countervailing duties while Congress completes adjustment on the Trade Package Act. My vote was not crucial, inasmuch as it passed, 82 to 15. However, had I been here, I would have voted nay, because I think it adversely impacts on our shoe industry and our textile industry, what is left of it, in New Hampshire. I thank the Senator from Louisiana for being so gracious. CXXV-412-Part 5 EXTENSION OF PROVISIONS OF LAW RELATING TO BUSINESS EX\u00ad PENSES OF STATE LEGISLATORS The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. LONG. Mr. President, at the end of the 95th Congress, certain temporary provisions related to the child support and social services programs expired be\u00ad cause the legislation providing for their extension did not reach enactment. As far as I am aware, there was no sub\u00ad stantive opposition to continuing these provisions and they were in fact ap\u00ad proved by the committees of jurisdiction in both Houses. Certain of these provi\u00ad sions were, in fact, passed by both the House and Senate although on bills which, for ather reasons, were not en\u00ad acted. Consequently, important aspects of the child support and social services program are now operating in the shadow of considerable uncertainty which needs to be promptly remedied. The amend\u00ad ment I am offering would correct this situation by making the affected aspects of these programs permanent and by making certain related changes which had been approved last year as a part of the continuation legislation reported from committee or which are needed to conform to changes in the welfare recip\u00ad ient tax credit provisions enacted last year. The amendment would make perma\u00ad nent a provision for Federal matching of the costs incurred by States for provid\u00ad ing services to families not on welfare to assist them in obtaining child support from absent parents. This authority has been in the law on a temporary basis and has proven well worth the cost in that it keeps families from having to be\u00ad come dependent on welfare in the first place. The amendment would also restore the authority of the States to use social services funds under title XX of the Social Security Act to pay the costs of employing welfare recipient in child care jobs. This authority was available in fiscal years 1977 and 1978. Although it was not as widely used as might be hoped, it was a very successful part of the program in those States that chose to employ it. The amendment would make this authority permanent and would also make certain changes to conform and better coordinate it with the provi\u00ad sions under which employers obtain a tax credit for hiring welfare recipients. The amendment would: First. Extend the authority to use title XX funds to reimburse the costs of hir\u00ad ing welfare recipients in child care jobs; Second. Incorporate this authority as a permanent part of the basic title XX statute; Third. Increase the maximum per re\u00ad cipient annual combined tax credit and title XX reimbursement from $5,000 to $6,000-the same level of wages that is eligible for the new welfare recipient tax credit; Fourth. Make the payment and credit available for part-time as well as full\u00ad time employment in child care jobs; Fifth. Permit the credit to be computed on the basis of the full wages including the part reimbursed under title XX\u00ad subject to a maximum combined tax credit and title XX payment not to ex\u00ad ceed 100 percent of the first $6,000 of wages; and Sixth. Make the tax credit coverage applicable to the period between the date it previously expired (October 1, 1978) and the effective date of the new credit enacted last year (January 1, 1979). At the end of last year, another fea\u00ad ture of the social services program which had authorized funding for certain serv\u00ad ices to addicts and alcoholics also ex\u00ad pired. These provisions have proven useful in certain States in treating these problems during the past few years. They were originally proposed by the Senate as permanent elements in the so\u00ad cial service program but were limited to a temporary enactment because of certain reservations expressed by the House of Representatives. Last year, however, the House indicated its willing\u00ad ness to accept them as a permanent part of the social services program and I know of no objection to them. The amendment I am proposing would follow this ap\u00ad proach, making these provisions a per\u00ad manent part of the title XX statute. I yield to the Senator from Missouri. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen\u00ad ator from Missouri. Mr. DANFORTH. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to the chair\u00ad man of the Finance Committee for this amendment, and especially for the ex\u00ad tension of the title XX funds for the use in detoxification centers. Detoxification programs have been highly successful in the State of Mis\u00ad souri and but for this amendment the funds have been shut off. This would make available the continuation of funds for this very worthwhile purpose in a program which has been highly success\u00ad ful in the State of Missouri. I appreciate the efforts of my chair\u00ad man in working this matter out. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen\u00ad ator from Louisiana. Mr. LONG. Mr. President, if there is no other request for time, I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time on the amendment. I assume there is no request. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the acting minority leader yield back his time? Mr. DANFORTH. I yield back the re\u00ad mainder of the minority's time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The amendment (UP No. 56) was agreed to. Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I have no request for time on the bill and I am prepared to yield back the time on the bill. e Mr. RIEGLE. Mr. President, I wish to emphasize the importance of the amend\u00ad ments offered by the senior Senator from Louisiana <Mr. LONG) to H.R. 3091. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Alco\u00ad holism and Drug Abuse, I believe that the provision of alcoholism and drug abuse services by the States through the use of title XX funds has had, and will continue to have a salutary effect not only on the alcoholics and drug abusers March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 6547 who receive these services, but also upon their families, their communities, and the State governments themselves. When title XX of the Social Security Act was signed into law in January of 1975, it authorized funding of \"appro\u00ad priate combinations of services * * * for alcoholics and drug abusers.\" Later that same year, the more detailed provisions currently being offered by Mr. Long were authorized on a temporary basis. The previous chairman of the Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Subcommittee, Mr. Hatha\u00ad way, sponsored the most recent renewal of these amendments, which expired at the end of the last fiscal year. Clearly, we have had sufficient experience with these amendments to know how valuable and indeed how necessary, they are to continued provision of effective drug and alcohol services under title XX. For many States, the most significant amendment pertains to use of title XX funds to cover the entire rehabilitative process for alcoholics and drug abusers, including initial detoxification, short\u00ad term residential treatment, and followup outpatient counseling and rehabilita\u00ad tion. All of these services are essential components of most treatment pro\u00ad grams for alcoholics and drug abusers, which generally find a comprehensive continuum-of-care approach to be most effective. The amendments dealing with confidentiality and the relationship be\u00ad tween detoxification and other services have also proven to be effective in en\u00ad couraging State activities to combat these problems. Mr. President, I support the current effort to renew these amendments and to make them permanent and retroac\u00ad tive. Title XX has effectively spurred many States to provide essential serv\u00ad ices to treat and prevent the recurrence of alcoholism and drug abuse among eligible individuals. In conjunction with other public and private efforts to com\u00ad bat these problems, I believe we can reduce the economic and social cost to the Nation from the abuse of alcohol and other drugs. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the minority leader yield back his time? Mr. DANFORTH. I yield back the time on this side. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back. If there be no fur\u00ad ther amendment to be proposed, the question is on the engrossment of the amendment and the third reading of the bill. The amendment was ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read a third time. The bill was read a third time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall it pass? So the bill (H.R. 3091) was passed. Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the bill was passed. Mr. DANFORTH. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk pro\u00ad ceeded to call the roll. Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I ask unani\u00ad mous consent that the order for the quo\u00ad rum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. IMPARTIAL OBSERVERS OF THE FORTHCOMING ELECTION IN RHODESIA Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Sen\u00ad ate proceed to the consideration of Cal\u00ad endar Order No. 50. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The concur\u00ad rent resolution will be stated by title. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 8) providing for impartial observers of the forthcoming election in Rhodesia. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the present consideration of the concurrent resolution? There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the concurrent resolution, which had been reported from the Committee on Foreign Relations with amendments as follows: On page 3, line 10, after \"under\" insert \"this\"; On page 3, line 10, strike\" (2) \"; On page 4, beginning with line 14, insert the following: SEC. 5. Nothing contained in this resolu\u00ad tion shall be deemed by implication or other\u00ad wise to indicate any determination as to the qualifications of the elections or the Gov\u00ad ernment, under section 27(2) of the Inter\u00ad national Security Assistance Act of 1978. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum and I ask that the time be charged equally against both sides on the measure. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk pro\u00ad ceeded to call the roll. Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. GRAVEL). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DANFORTH. Mr. President, I wonder who is expected on this matter on our side. I think Senator HAYAKAWA has an interest in it, and Senator HELMS undoubtedly has, as well as Senator JAVITS. Mr. CHURCH. It had been my under\u00ad standing that Senator HAYAKAWA would be representing the Republican side of the committee in connection with the resolution. He has a keen personal inter\u00ad est in it. Senator McGOVERN will be rep\u00ad t\"esenting the Democratic side. My purpose now is simply to lay the resolution before the Senate and make a few introductory remarks. Mr. DANFORTH. I did not see Sen\u00ad ator HAYAKAWA in the Chamber, and I wanted to make sure he was here. Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, it is both a privilege and a pleasure to support the resolution, Senate Concurrent Resolu\u00ad tion 8, which deals with the Rhodesian conflict, probably the most critical issue currently facing the United States in the Continent of Africa. The origins of the Rhodesian war reach back to 1965. At that time, the self-governing British colony dominated by a white minority regime declared its independence from Whitehall. The es\u00ad sential reason for UDI, as it is commonly called, was the white minority's objec\u00ad tions to British proposals for a gradual transfer of political power to the black majority. Had they, at that time, ac\u00ad cepted a gradual transition toward ma\u00ad jority rule, there might be peace in Rhodesia today. Faced with a rebellion, and disdain\u00ad ing the use of force, Britain went to the United Nations, asked for and obtained, mandatory economic sanctions. The U.S. record on complying with the United Nations-imposed sanctions has been inconsistent. In 1968, we imposed them, in 1971 lifted them, in 1977 reim\u00ad posed them, and in 1978 almost lifted them again. Now, the controversy sur\u00ad rounding the sanctions question is reach\u00ad ing a new threshold, as the world searches for a solution to end the slaugh\u00ad ter in what might have been a bountiful and beautiful land, a model of racial harmony. The Rhodesian conflict started as a constitutional crisis; it has since disin\u00ad tegrated into a brutal war. Over the past 6 years, the war has taken thousands of lives, and wreaked havoc on the Rhode\u00ad sian economy. It threatens to become a protracted conflict, with profound and disturbing implications for the stability of southern Africa, for East-West rela\u00ad tions, and for the course of race relations in our own country. National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski was quoted in the Washington Post on December 21, 1978, making the same point in a some\u00ad what more earthy fashion. The Lest of the Carter administration's initiatives in Rhodesia, he commented, will come \"when white nuns being raped by black guerrillas wearing red stars on their armbands start appearing on nightly television news.\" Mr. President, this vivid description of how racial tensions could be triggered should serve to underscore the very seri\u00ad ous potential this war has of becoming a major international crisis. Rhodesia con\u00ad tains the seeds of a major race war that could enflame the whole of southern Africa, one of the richest and most vola\u00ad tile areas of the world today. The exacer\u00ad bation of racial tension in Africa could poison our relations with the Third\u00b7 World as a whole, especially if we appear to be backing a retreating white minority. If foreign powers intervene in Rhodesia, as they did in Angola, we could also face the prospect of another cold war contest in a remote Third World country. Access to strategic materials in the region would be placed in jeopardy by the disorder and instability that would follow. Some have even suggested linking Soviet activities in support of the guerrilla forces to our 6548 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE March 28, 1979 consideration of the SALT Treaty. For these reasons, we cannot ignore the de\u00ad teriorating situation in Rhodesia. The stakes are much too high. The problem we face here, as in so many unstable areas of the world, is the limits of our influence. Over the past 2 years, the Carter administration, in con\u00ad cert with Great Britain, has repeatedly tried to promote a diplomatic solution. But the search for peace has been elu\u00ad sive. A report by British special emissary Cledwyn Hughes concluded that none of the parties in the conflict-either the Salisbury group or the so-called Patriotic FTont-are presently interested in nego\u00ad tiating an end to the dispute. On the one hand, the Salisbury group is oper\u00ad ating on the premise that their salvation lies in getting sanctions to be lifted and in winning diplomatic recognition from the West. The Patriotic Front, on the other hand, feels that time is on their side, that they can eventually achieve total victory on the battlefield. The front line states that surround Rhodesia--and which have also become victims of this tragic war-want desperately to end the fighting. More than the Rhodesian par\u00ad ties, they support the Anglo-American plan which calls for internationally supervised elections and a U.N. peace\u00ad keeping force. The U.S. appeal for the start of nego\u00ad tiations of these terms was reiterated once again by Secretary of State Cyrus Vance on March 17, 1979, though his in\u00ad vitation seemed to fall on deaf ears. The Government of Rhodesia will hold its own election on April 20, hoping to com\u00ad ply with the requirements of the Case\u00ad Javits amendment enacted last year. For the Rhodesia Government, the expecta\u00ad tion is that this election could lay the foundation for a unilateral lifting of sanctions by the United States. It is in this context that the resolution before the Senate is being considered. According to the terms of section 27 of the International Security Assistance Act of 1978 <the so-called Case-Javits amendment), the President is obligated to make a determination, whether posi\u00ad tive or negative, with regard to two con\u00ad ditions: First, the Government of Rho\u00ad desia has demonstrated its willingness to negotiate in good faith at an all-parties conference, held under international auspices, on all relevant issues; and second, a government has been installed chos\u00b7en by free elections in which all political and population groups have been allowed to participate freely, with observation by impartial, internation\u00ad ally recognized observers. According to the law, if the President makes a positive determination on these two conditions, sanctions must automat\u00ad ically be lifted. However, there is an inherent problem in implementing this legislation. Neither the President nor Congress can easily make a determination on the validity of the election consistent with the terms of the Case-Javits amendment . For exam\u00ad ple, the amendment requires that the election be one in \"which all political and population groups have been allowed to participate freely .\" Because of the illegal status of the regime, no interna-tional organization such as the United Nations or the Organization for African Unity, is prepared to send observers to report on whether that requirement is met. What we are likely to get in the ab\u00ad sence of internationally recognized ob\u00ad servers is a spate of conflicting partisan reports that will only serve to polarize the issue further. Senate Concurrent Resolution 8 fills this gap. Sponsored by Senators McGov\u00ad ERN and HAYAKAWA-two men who regard the Rhodesian issue from totally differ\u00ad ent perspectives-this resolution pro\u00ad poses to send an impartial factfinding mission composed of people recruited from private life to monitor the Rho\u00ad desian election and issue a report on their findings. Mr. President, this is an unprecedented initiative on the part of the U.S. Con\u00ad gress. In agreeing to this resolution, we will be acting in anticipation of an issue that is certain to be controversial. Sen\u00ad ators McGOVERN and HAYAKAWA have acted with keen foresight in proposing to get an independent report for the use of both the legislative and executive branches. It could well turn out to be the most reliable assessment of an issue that has been pivotal to our relations with all of Africa. I urge the Senate to agree to this resolution in the interests of making a significant contribution to the formulation of a sound foreign policy in Africa. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes. Mr. President, I, first of all, express my appreciation to the Senator from Idaho, Senator CHURCH, for his remarks in sup\u00ad port of Senate Concurrent Resolution 8, sponsored by Senator HAYAKAWA and my\u00ad self, and also for his leadership as the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations during the consideration of this resolution and its favorable report\u00ad ing by our committee. Indeed, I am delighted to see the sup\u00ad port which this resolution has received in the Senate. It was reported favorably by the Committee on Foreign Relations by a vote of 8 to 1, and, in addition to Senator HAYAKAWA and myself, 10 other Senators have now added their names as cosponsors, and I am advised one addi\u00ad tional Senator has asked to be added as a cosponsor. Some 13 Members of the Senate have now joined in the cosponsor\u00ad ship of this resolution representing a broad bipartisan and ideological cross section of the Senate. They are Senators JAVITS, DANFORTH, COHEN, WALLOP, DURENBERGER, HOLLINGS, SCHMITT, THURMOND, CANNON, HUMPHREY, and NUNN. At the outset, Mr. President, let me comment on the \"odd couple\" that has teamed up to promote this resolution, namely, Senator HAYAKAWA, of Califor- nia, and myself. As Members of the Senate are well a ware, Rhodesia is only one of several issues about which the Senator from California and I differ, although we en\u00ad joy the most congenial personal relation\u00ad ships. We are poles apart politically and ideologically, including on the Rhodesian question iitself. Senator HAYAKAWA, and I think I am thoroughly familiar with his views, supported the Helms amendment to lift sanctions last year. I continue to support sanctions, given the present state of affairs in Rhodesia. Senator HAYAKAWA was instrumental in getting President Smith to come to the United States. I feel that Mr. Smith, the author of UDI and a symbol of white minority rule, is one of the principal stumbling blocks to a peaceful solution to the conflict. During my visit to Rhodesia 4 months ago, I frankly advised Mr. Smith directly to resign from office as soon as possible, a suggestion that was not enthusiasti\u00ad cally received, but which was sincerely made. Senator HAYAKAWA feels that the lift\u00ad ing of sanctions could help the internal settlement, a goal which he deems to be in the best interests of the United States and our security concerns. I feel tfiat the lifting of sanctions would be inter\u00ad preted as American backing for a minor\u00ad ity regime, having disastrous conse\u00ad quences for our foreign policy interests in Africa. If I understand his position correctly, the Senator from California, like many other people in this country, believes that the Rhodesian war is essentially an ideological struggle between Soviet\u00ad backed Marxist terrorists, on one hand. and Western-oriented Christian moder\u00ad ates, on the other. Although I am mindful of the poten\u00ad tial for ideological forces to take hold, I am of the view that the Rhcdesian conflict is essentially two interacting struggles: One is the struggle of nation\u00ad alism against racism. The other is the struggle of rival nationalisms, a pattern of competition tbat has come into play in many African countries following decolonization. Our responsibility, as a major Western power that stands for self-determination and majority rule, is not to intervene in nationalist internal struggles but to in\u00ad sure that we act in ways that are as con\u00ad sistent as possible with our own values and principles. Our role, in short, is to take a firm stand against racism. Having laid out where Senator HAYA\u00ad KAWA and I differ, I now turn my atten\u00ad tion to the thinking that went into our joint support of this resolution, presum\u00ad ably the one major issue on which we presently agree. Basically, our resolution is a product of our assessment of the historical, the legal, and the political context in which the question of Rhode\u00ad sian sanctions has been cast. I shall deal with those three issues one by one. First, the historical aspect: We all know the record of congressional action on Rhodesian sanctions. Senator CHURCH has just underscored the inconsistency with which Congress has dealt with this question, often caus\u00ad ing confusion, if not anger, among our friends abroad. U.S. vacillation on this question of sanctions is widely interpre\u00ad ted not as an accommodation to shifting events or domestic pressures but as a lack of will to stand up for racial justice. No other country in the world, I regret March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 6549 to say, has reversed itself as often as we have on this issue that is so sensitive in the minds of people concerned about events in Africa. This brings me to the legal context in which this resolution is proposed. Now. Mr. President, to be frank I would not have supported this resolution myself if it had been proposed last year when the Rhodesian Government had origi\u00ad nally scheduled an election for Decem\u00ad ber 31, 1978. There, in fact, would have been no practical purpose served by send\u00ad ing observers because until late last year there was no legal requirement to take that election into account in dealing with the sanctions issue. The President and Congress could have decided on the basis of the constitutional proposals and the general political situ\u00ad ation whether or not a change of policy was justified. But now new political reali\u00ad ties have to be faced. The first and fore\u00ad most is the passage of section 27 of the International Security Assistance Act of 1978, a law that established a formula for the automatic lifting of sanctions. Mr. President, whether we like it or not, whether we agree with it or not, that is the law of the land. It is the pol\u00ad icy which we are bound to follow unless Congress overrides it. So it is partly in the light of the requirements of this leg\u00ad islation that the current resolution pro\u00ad posing to send observers to the Rhode\u00ad sian election make sense. We know that under that law the President must make a determination, positive or negative, on whether the elec\u00ad tion is free and fair. We know that the election will be con\u00ad troversial. It has already been argued by well-intentioned groups all over this country, there has been a steady stream of them coming to my office, some argu\u00ad ing that the election is unfair on the surface, others arguing that the people of Rhodesia have agreed to have an elec\u00ad tion, so what is the argument about? But obviously there are sharp differ\u00ad ences of opinion that will provoke great controversy as to whether this election is a valid one or whether it is not, and there will be many partisan observers, whether we pass this resolution or not, who will report on the conduct of the election. We know there will be strong pres\u00ad sures on the administration, which is perceived in many circles as being par\u00ad tisan itself, and I frankly admit my own partisanship, on my own bias, on this issue. But all will be making an effort to make a positive determination which would lift sanctions or, arguing nega\u00ad tively, that sanctions should not be lifted. If the President does not make such a finding, then the stage could be set for a direct confrontation between Con\u00ad gress and the executive branch. As every Senator knows there is nothing new about that on this issue of sanctions. A confrontation such as that could well place in doubt the international credi\u00ad bility of the United States as a country opposed to racism. It is this confrontation, and the sharp partisanship and the controversy, that Senator HAYAKAWA and I want to avoid both for domestic and foreign policy rea\u00ad sons, and I think we would be the first ones to admit that neither one of us is in a position to make a totally im\u00ad partial judgment about events in Rho\u00ad desia and the whole question of sanc\u00ad tions. We both have strong convictions on this question, and the differences be\u00ad tween us illustrate the widespread dif\u00ad ferences in the country itself on Rho\u00ad desian issues. This, Mr. President, brings me to the second concern, the political context in which this resolution is proposed. Any\u00ad one who has followed this issue knows that the Case-Javits amendment was the only thing that stopped the 95th Con\u00ad gress from lifting sanctions last year. An earlier amendment to lift sanctions unconditionally, introduced by Senator HELMS, failed by only four votes. The 96th Congress is poised for similar action. It is possible that the attempt to lift sanctions may succeed, and then again it may well fail, but I would pre\u00ad fer that whatever Congress decides to do that it be done on the basis of a reason\u00ad able degree of confidence that the prin\u00ad ciples for which the United States stands, self-determination and majority rule, are not compromised. For that assurance to be given it is 'important that we adhere to the propo\u00ad sition that the holding of free and fair elections is a minimal criterion for yet another policy reversal on this issue. The substance of the Rhodesian reso\u00ad lution is simple enough. It proposes to fund a team of independent observers recruited from private life to monitor the Rhodesian election to be held in April and to submit a report to Congress. Obviously, there will be problems to iron out in implementing this idea. Many of them were raised during the hearings and in committee markup on the resolution now before the Senate. But, on balance, it is my view and that of Senator HAYAKAWA that this resolution could go a long way toward coming to grips with this issue, enabling both branches of government to formulate a sound foreign policy toward Rhodesia. So I am very hopeful that my col\u00ad leagues will support this resolution in the spirit in which it is offered, namely, to obtain an accurate assessment of wheth\u00ad er or not the upcoming Rhodesian elec\u00ad tion fulfills the terms of the Case-Javits amendment within which we \u00b7and the President are bound to act. I might just underscore at this point, Mr. President, the language in the Case\u00ad Javits proposal which is now the law of the land. It sets forth these two condi\u00ad tions under which the President could make a determination that sanctions would be lifted : First, that the Government of Rho\u00ad desia has demonstrated its willingness to negotiate in good faith at an all-party conference held under international aus\u00ad pices on all relevant issues. The second criterion: A government has been installed, chosen by free elec- tions, in which all political and popula\u00ad tion groups have been allowed to partic-ipate freely, and then this important proviso, with observation by impartial internationally recognized observers. So there is a strong legislative history here, Mr. President, making the case for the Congress to follow up on the law that we passed last year to provide those observers. Senator CHURCH has made clear why they are not being provided by other governments, by international organiza\u00ad tions. But it is important that the Con\u00ad gress of the United States, having estab\u00ad lished the conditions by law under which the President should deal with this ques\u00ad tion of sanctions, follow up on its own legal requirements that a part of that assessment includes observation of that election by impartial internationally rec\u00ad ognized observers. Now, Mr. President, after we started our deliberations on this matter we were advised that there might be some secu\u00ad rity concerns for the observer team should Congress decide to send such a team to Rhodesia, and we decided that it was necessary to make some modest provision to cooperate with the Rhode\u00ad sian Government in providing such se\u00ad curity as we can. So I have an amend\u00ad ment at the desk that fully meets the intent of our committee. This amend\u00ad ment provides for an additional expendi\u00ad ture of $75,000 to cover the cost of pri\u00ad vate security advisers for the observer team and of other miscellaneous expenses such as the rental of equip\u00ad ment, communications, and clerical and administrative support. When the original estimate of the cost of the observer team was drawn up, we did not include the hiring of independent security advisers, but as we explored the problems involved in this exercise, we felt that it would be advisable to enable this team of 25 to 50 observers to have some competent security personnel with them. Their function would be to coordi\u00ad nate between the American observer team and the Rhodesian authorities. They would go to Rhodesia in advance of the observer team, to survey the security measures that the Rhodesian Govern\u00ad ment plans to make available. They would then return to the United States to consult with our Government security experts, and then accompany the observ\u00ad ers to Rhodesia to continue to act as advisers. UP AMENDMENT NO. 57 Mr. President, I move the adoption of this amendment. I guess it has to be re\u00ad ported first. I ask that the amendment be stated. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator send his amendment to the desk? Mr. McGOVERN. It was sent to the desk, I think. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be stated. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Mc\u00ad GOVERN) proposes an unprinted amendment numbered 57: Page 4, line 5, strike \"$175,000\" and insert in lieu thereof \"$250,000\". Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, as I have already said, the purposes of this 65\u00b750 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE March 28, 1979 increase in the authorization figure from $175,000 to $250,000 would be to author\u00ad ize an additional $75,000 for covering the security expenses involved. I would hope the Senate would agree to that modifi\u00ad cation of the concurrent resolution, and I move its adoption. Mr. HAYAKAWA. Mr. President, I am very happy to agree to that amendment. I think it is a responsible addition. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques\u00ad tion is on agreeing to the amendment. Mr. TSONGAS. Mr. President , could we have a discussion of the amendment? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques\u00ad tion is on agreeing to the amendment. Mr. TSONGAS. Mr. President , I would like to be heard on the issue, and expand on it somewhat. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is entitled to do that. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Massachu\u00ad r.etts. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, who has control of the time in opposition to the amendment? Mr. TSONGAS. Mr. President, I would inform the Chair that the control of the time is on the side of those who favor the resolution , and those of us who oppose it have no allocated time. Mr. McGOVERN. How much time would the Senator like? Mr. TSONGAS. Fifteen minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would point out that this amend\u00ad ment is not in order until the committee amendments have been disposed of. Mr. TSONGAS. Pardon? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Until the committee amendments have been dis\u00ad posed of. Mr. TSONGAS. Is it in order for the Senator from Massachusetts to speak on the amendment to the resolution at this time? The PRESIDING OFFICER. He can speak on an amendment which is not be\u00ad fore the body, if the Senator cares to yield him the time. Mr. HAYAKAWA. Mr. President, I wonder if the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts would permit me to make an introductory statement , too, along with Mr. McGOVERN, before he makes his objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Cali\u00ad fornia for the purposes of an introduc\u00ad tory statement. Mr. HAYAKAWA. I am very grateful to the Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. President, let me start by express\u00ad ing my thanks to the distinguished Sen\u00ad ator from Idaho for his fair and impar\u00ad tial account of the history of the prob\u00ad lems with respect to Rhodesia. He has provided us with an excellent background against which to evaluate the proposals now before us. I also express my deep gratitude to the distinguished Senator from South Da\u00ad kota for his account of how he and I, despite our differing backgrounds and views, have come together on this par\u00ad ticular proposal for observer teams. His statement of the legislative history of our work in relationship to Rhodesia and his account of the present legislative situation are, as is to be expected from the Senator from South Dakota, accurate and authoritative, and I am glad to add my comments in the light of these back\u00ad ground presentations. I am sure that many of our colleagues in this Chamber were surprised when they saw the names of the two authors of this resolution . Senator McGOVERN and I are usually to be found on the op\u00ad posite side of legislative issues, but in this particular case, we decided to join forces. The future of Rhodesia is not only important to the black and white in\u00ad habitants of this beautiful country. A positive solution of the Rhodesian prob\u00ad lem would have far-reaching benign repercussions, in all of Africa and it would greatly influence future U.S. poli\u00ad cies toward the Third World. I would add, too, that the prospects of ultimate peaceful resolution of the prob\u00ad lems of South Africa are also involved in the solution we hope to provide in Rho\u00ad desia. The consequences of a continua\u00ad tion or intensification of the guerrilla war, on the other hand, would be most calamitous for the entire world. There can be no doubt, I think, that the forthcoming elections will be an event of historical significance. The elections are of course part of the so-called inter\u00ad nal settlement. The administration and other opponents of Ian Smith consider the internal settlement unsatisfactory. They therefore argue that the dispatch of qualified, objective observers would legitimize the new constitution. Neither Senator McGOVERN nor I see it that way. Neither my distinguished colleague of South Dakota nor I are enthusiastic about the new Rhodesian Constitution. We both have reservations of various de\u00ad grees. But we both believe that it is one thing to have a less-than-perfect con\u00ad stitution arrived at by honest elections or to have it imposed by a fraudulent vote. As Senate Concurrent Resolution 8 em\u00ad phasizes, an affirmative vote for the reso\u00ad lution does only mean that Congress should be able to base future decisions in this regard on the report of objective and qualified observers. When we talk about the less-than-per\u00ad fect constitution, Mr. President, I would like to point out that one of the principal criticisms of the Rhodesian Constitution is that it reserves 48 seats out of a parlia\u00ad ment of 100 for the non-African popula\u00ad tion, namely, the whites and Asians. That is, 4 percent of the population get 48 per\u00ad cent of the seats. This is regarded, of course, as extraordinarily unfair, and in one sense it is. But I would also like to point out that in the beginning of these African nations which are inhabited by both native blacks and whites and Asians who have come in to help develop these countries, this disproportion in repre\u00ad sentation has been quite common in history. In Ghana's 1960 Constitution, 30 per\u00ad cent of the seats were reserved for 1 per\u00ad cent of the population. In Tanzania, 10 percent of the seats were reserved for something like 3 percent of the popula\u00ad tion. And in Zambia, 15 seats were re-served for 39 million blacks, and 15 seats were also reserved for 84,000 whites. These proportions simply represent, Mr. President, the differences in the levels of technological and managerial abilities represented by the whites and the Asians in these African countries to help them get started on the course of economic development. Mr. President, I really find i\u00b7t difficult to understand the administration's posi\u00ad tion regarding the alleged illegality of the Smith regime. An answer may be found in a scholarly treatise by the well\u00ad known political scientist, Andrew Scott, in his book \"The Functioning of -the In\u00ad ternational Political System.\" Scott deals extensively with the \"learn\u00ad ing and forgetting\" processes of the deci\u00ad sionmakers. As he points out, decision\u00ad makers are able to make images of their environment only because of the stored memories of the political system in which they operate. Such stored memories may or may not represent an accurate inter\u00ad pretation of past events and may or may not offer an accurate picture of the ex\u00ad isting situation. In a similar vein, the decisionmaking systems will normally have the capacity to remember and will almost certainly have the capacity to forget. Scott concludes that forgetting is a selective process. Each system will de\u00ad velop patterns regarding the material that it chooses to remember or chooses to forget. Mr. President, I would like to suggest that we have before us a telling exam\u00ad ple of the selective process O'f forgetting which Andrew Scott talks about. Obvi\u00ad ously, the Carter administration has chosen to forget that President Carter's predecessor 38 times removed acted equally illegally as Ian Smith. It seems to have forgotten that the first American Constitution, the Articles of Confedera\u00ad tion, after 9 years was found unsatisfac\u00ad tory and had to be replaced as no doubt the Constitution of Rhodesia will ulti\u00ad mately have to be replaced. The admin\u00ad istration seems to have forgotten that the new Constitution of the United States immediately had to be amended and that within 3 years, 10 amendments, the Bill of Rights, had to be introduced. And most important, the administration has chosen to forget that about 200 years had to elapse until all citizens of this great Republic, regardless Qf color. were able to enjoy the full rights which the Con\u00ad stitution had promised. In spite of this unimpressive record. the emissaries of the Carter administration have the te\u00ad merity to pass a negative judgment on the internal settlement. That seems to be incredible intellectual arrogance. No wonder that the statements of the ad\u00ad ministration are often viewed with hos\u00ad tility abroad. Mr. President, I would like to make some final comments a\u00b7bout the observer team. I think the administration's re\u00ad fusal to send observers is very unwise. The State Department leaves itself open to the suspicion that it might be afraid of a positive report. The argument that the international press will report on the elections and that, therefore, no observers are needed does not hold any water with me. We oannot even get March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 6551 !actual and unbiased press reports on elections in Chicago. There is a liberal press and there are conservative papers. We can take it for granted that the rePorts by the international press will be in line with this basic world view. It stands to reason that the exclusive reliance on the international press will enable the State Department to pick and c\u00b7hoose. Apparently, this is the plan and this is precisely what resolution 8 tries to avoid. Let me repeat once more, Congress must have the best possible basis for the future decisions. I, there! ore, hope the Senate will speedily authorize the ob\u00ad server program authorized by this piece of legislation. !thank the Chair. I should like to add a couple of foot\u00ad notes to the foregoing remarks, Mr. President. We all realize how important the peaceful resolution of problems in Rho\u00ad desia is to the future of racial relations not only in Africa but elsewhere in the world. It is well known to those who have visi\u00b7ted Rhodesia that, however much there are inequities in the legal status of blacks and whites, at the level of inter\u00ad personal relations Rhodesia is famous for having the best race relations in the world, far, far better than South Africa and far better than many parts of the United States. Another fact is that Rhodesia has the best educated black populatiron of any nation in Africa. I am told that there are something like 10,000 university gradu\u00ad ates who are blacks in Rhodesia, and many an African country has started out with not more than a dozen blacks with college educations. In other words, in the past history of Rhodesia care has been taken that the black population will pre\u00ad pare itself for citizenship, for literacy, and to take a place in the managerial and political life of the nation. I want to emphasize again that with all its imperfections the constitution of the new Rhodesia-Zimbabwe is only one step in an evolutionary process. Further steps are bound to follow, just as they followed the first American Constitution to perfect it over time. For these reasons, I regard the pres\u00ad ence of the impartial observer team ex\u00ad traordinarily importantly in providing us with the facts. People have also asked me at various times, \"Is there precedent for foreign observers of elections doing anything that is useful in situations of this kind?\" It will be recalled that elections in Vietnam were observed and reported upon with objectivity and justice. In more recent times an observer team went to Bolivia, ~n international observer team, if I remember correctly, and rePorted unfavorably on the results of that elec\u00ad tion and the conduct Olf it, and, conse\u00ad quently, the election was disqualified. After that, a military government took over, a.nd then after a further process of evolution, a more stable, democrati\u00ad cally elected, seems to have been put into place. We have had recently the experience of neutral observers in Namibia reporting on the elections there. The fact that a relatively small number of people with experience and background in these mat\u00ad ters can go into a country whose lan\u00ad guage they often cannot speak, never\u00ad theless shows that it is possible for a trained, qualified group of observers to go into a country and find out what is going on and be able to give some kind of report with some kind of objectivity as to the fairness Qlf that election. Again let me thank the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the distingiushed Senator from Idaho, and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa, the distinguished Senator from South Dakota, for their espousal of this legislation. I urge all my colleagues to support it. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts who has been wait\u00ad ing to talk on this subject. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen\u00ad ator from Massachusetts. Mr. TSONGAS. Thank you, Mr. Presi\u00ad dent. I will start off by saying that I con\u00ad sider this to be a sad occasion. I think what we are going to do today, since it looks like it will pass, will have a major negative impact on U.S. relations in black Africa. I hope it is not too extreme to say that what we are engaging in here is the equivalent o! the Tonkin Gulf, a hasty decision based upon facts which will have long-term implications. I would like to suggest why I feel that way. On the face of it, this resolution ap\u00ad pears reasonable and responsible. The sending of observers to an election in Rhodesia may sound to many like a con\u00ad structive initiative. But appearances can be deceiving and, in this case, they are. Although well-intended by its sponsors, this resolution presents grave risks and problems which the Senate cannot ig\u00ad nore. I am apposed for a number of rea\u00ad sons. My objections to this resolution fall into three categories: It is unnecessary; it is impractical; and it would invoke grave foreign policy risks. Why unnecessary? The answer is sim\u00ad ply that the upcoming election does not satisfy the provisions of the Case-Javits amendment. There is no need to observe an election which is already known to fall far short of the explicit requirements of the Case-Javits amendment. For example, the amendment states that the Government of Rhodesia must \"demonstrate its willingness to negotiate in good faith at an all-parties confer\u00ad ence held under international auspices on all relevant issues.\" The committee re\u00ad port makes clear thr..t \"all relevant is\u00ad sues\" include the Anglo-American plan. But the Rhodesian Government has stated repeatedly that it will not accept preconditions to an aU-parties confer\u00ad ence. Ian Smith and his colleagues will attend an all-parties conference, but they will not commit themselves to discussing any \"relavant issue\" whatsoever. That is a crucial distinction and it violates the first provision of the Case-Javits amend\u00ad ment. There is a second, even more serious, violation. The Case-Javits amendment states that participation in the election is to be open to all political and popula\u00ad tion groups. But the Rhodesian Govern\u00ad ment has banned the internal wings of the guerrilla groups. They cannot hold rallies, publish their programs, or use the media in any way. This situation has pre\u00ad vailed for years with only a brief hiatus last summer. How can an election be \"open\" to all groups if two of the major political par\u00ad ties have been banned from political a-c\u00ad tivity for so long? Finally, the Case-Javits amendment requires the holding of free elections. This is an imprecise term, but we must still ask if the forthcoming election will be free. The Constitution on which this election is based was approved by a white referendum only. No blacks voted in that referendum; only white. White are only 3 percent of the population of Rho\u00ad desia. As you know, the Constitution en\u00ad trenches white control over much of the Government for another 10 years. By over-representing whites in both the ex\u00ad ecutive and legislative branches, the Constitution establishes a white veto Power over any important legislation. There has been no referendum on this Constitution for the country's 7 million blacks. Let me repeat that: There has been no referendum on this Constitution for the country's 7 million blacks. I think that tells us something. The election itself will arrange voters into two groups: Registered whites who will vote for the white candidate of their choice, a;nd unregistered blacks who will vote for a political party, not an indi\u00ad vidual. The potential for fraud is obvi\u00ad ous. I can add that 90 percent of the country has been under martial law for some time. Under these conditions, the election can hardly be called free and fair. Let me use another example. If you are black and you are opposed to the Constitution, as many of them are, what do you do? If you vote, you participate and that is lending credence to the elec\u00ad tion. If you do not vote, then you are simply not counted. So if you believe that this Constitution is a fraud, as many blacks in Rhodesia do, there is no ve\u00ad hicle for expressing those feelings. So this election becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy. Those who vote, by definition, support it; those who do not vote are not included. Therefore, the situation comes full circle. I think that these are important points to keep in mind. The Case-Javits lan\u00ad guage clearly rejects this election on the basis of information the Rhodesian Gov\u00ad ernment itself has publicized. But I am not one to insist on pure electoral de\u00ad mocracy in the Third World. There are other important factors to consider, such as practical questions bearing on the observer team. The impracticality of this resolution is, in my mind, one of its most glaring weaknesses. The resolution would send up to 50 individuals, many of them Americans, to observe an election in a country torn by war, where 90 percent of the country is under martial law, where private armies attached to various leaders roam the countryside perform\u00ad ing \"political education,\" where planes are shot out of the sky, where all ve\u00ad hicles travel with an armed convoy, where the capital itself is vulnerable to 6552 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE March 28, 1979 mortar attack, and where guerrilla forces move freely over most o.f the country. We are going to send our people into this situation. Are we prepared to send the Sergeant at Arms to protect our \u00b7surrogates in Rhodesia? I think not. Casualties run as high as 3,000 per month, and most of them are black ci\u00ad vilians. The guerrilla forces are deter\u00ad mined to disrupt the election by force, if necessary. It is into that environment that the brave observers will venture. Sent by the administration? No. Sent by us, the Senate. We are not going over there. We are not going to be at risk. Those people will be. We have no way to protect them. There is not one Senator who can stand up and guarantee the safety of the people we would send over there. If anything happened to them, then what? They will receive protection from the Rhodesian Government, the resolution claims. But can the Rhodesian Govern\u00ad ment guarantee the safety of the ob\u00ad servers? If Salisbury oil depots can be destroyed by guerrilla mortars, then an observer team is not safe anywhere in Rhodesia. What will be the response of the Congress if any of the observers are wounded or even killed? Again, the Ton\u00ad kin Gulf analogy. How will the United States respond if guerrilla forces capture and hold hostage members of the ob\u00ad server team? Before we send observers to Rhodesia, we must consider these grave risks. We must also consider the question of theaobservers' impartiality. Rhodesian military personnel will escort the ob\u00ad servers at all times. The observers will hear the Rhodesian side of the war from their escorts day after day. The analogy was used by the distin\u00ad guished Senator from California as to the elections in Chicago. It is like ob\u00ad serving the elections in Chicago by be\u00ad ing driven around by Mayor Daley. How long can the team retain its ob\u00ad jectivity under such conditions? I won\u00ad der how long you or I would remain neutral traveling with an army, our ears filled with their point of view and our safety totally dependent on their pro\u00ad tection. There is another striking impractical\u00ad ity to consider. The resolution states that the observers must determine the extent of guerrilla intimidation of voters and also measure the level of volun\u00ad tary abstention from the election. These requirements indicate to me that the observers must do more than merely observe polling places. They must un\u00ad dertake a survey in the countryside to understand how many people abstained and for what reasons. This is an enor\u00ad mous, complex task. I do not think any\u00ad one can suggest that it can be done. Given the security risks and in view of the limited resources of the observer team, it seems to me that the resolution asks the impossible. An effective observer team for any Third World election is a serious un\u00ad dertaking. The U.N. plan for Namibia is an interesting standard for comparison. It requires a cease-fire 7 months before the election, a 7,000-man U.N. monitor\u00ad ing force, confinement of the combatants to military bases, U.N. supervision of the election campaign and of the election itself, and a continued U.N. presence after the election to insure faithful com\u00ad pliance with the election results. In com\u00ad parison, a 50-man observer team-our team-touring Rhodesia for a few weeks is hopelessly inadequate. The impracticalities of the resolution are, indeed, striking, but the foreign policy risks of the resolution are even more disturbing to me. I refer the membership to the article I had published today in the New York Times on Angola, another example. This resolution will launch the United States on a disastrous course in Rhodesia and Southern Africa. It will associate the United States with the Rhodesian Gov\u00ad ernment at a time when the outlook for the Smith regime is most unfavorable. It is important to recognize how desperate the situation has become for Mr. Smith, Bishop Muzorewa, and Reverend Sithole, the self-appointed leaders of this tran\u00ad sitional regime. This war has raged now for over 5 years. Neither side is willing to negotiate a peaceful settlement, but one side is clearly gaining on the other. The guer\u00ad rilla forces are by all accounts winning the war. Mr. Smith has conceded that point. His internal settlement is not in danger of imminent defeat, but he is steadily losing ground. Bombing raids into neighboring countries, as lethal as they are, have had no impact on guerrilla infiltration into Rhodesia. The signs of deterioration are everywhere. Whites are leaving Rhodesia in large numbers. The net outfiow for December was a record 2, 770 people. The Smith government has promised bonuses for those civil servants and soldiers who will stay on past April, but another 1,000 whites left Rhodesia in January. The military turned to conscription of black recruits late last year, but only 20 per\u00ad cent of those called actually reported for induction. Mr. Smith's black colleagues have formed private armies to serve their private ambitions. Guerrillas control some areas so effectively that the Rho\u00ad desian Army will not enter those zones. These facts are not controversial-no reliable analyst claims that Rhodesia is winning the war-almost all agree that the guerrillas will ultimately prevail. The Rhodesian Government has mounted every effort to avert defeat. They have called on the guerrillas to lay down their arms and join the inter\u00ad nal settlement but wtih meager results. They have written a constitution and scheduled elections with black par\u00ad ticipation. But the constitution en\u00ad trenches white control over the Govern\u00ad ment and has failed to win the support of the guerrillas or the civilian popula\u00ad tion. The opponents of the Salisbury re\u00ad gime grow in number. The direction of the war demonstrates how little black support there is for the Rhodesian Gov\u00ad ernment and its future. The Govern\u00ad ment has tacitly admitted its lack of black support by declining to hold a black referendum on the constitution, something we would consider a prereq\u00ad uisite to suggesting we have black sup\u00ad port. It is clear enough that the sending of American observers to Rhodesia places American policy squarely on the deck of a sinking ship. With the war going so badly for Ian Smith and his associates, this resolution will push the United States closer to this doomed re\u00ad gime. For it must be understood that sending observers to this election is not a neutral act. It amounts to a de facto recognition of the Smith regime. The Rhodesian Government will interpret the observers as the first step the United States will take toward lifting economic sanctions and recognizing their illegal regime. They will take heart and renew their efforts to win the war. African states and Third World will see the observers as proof of Ameri\u00ad ca's original intention to support white rule in Southern Africa, American credibility in the Third World and par\u00ad ticularly in Africa will suffer great harm. The neighboring states of Zam\u00ad bia and Mozambique will find it increas\u00ad ingly dim.cult to reject offers of major Cuban and Soviet involvement. I re\u00ad member we used to be concerned about that. South Africa will be encouraged to step up its support for the post-elec\u00ad tion government in Rhodesia. These pos\u00ad sible developments illustrate the dis\u00ad turbing potential of this resolution to escalate and internationalize the war in Rhodesia. Our tacit recognition of the Rhodesian Government is a provocative and dangerous act. This situation reminds me of another U.S. initiative in the Third World. Send\u00ad ing observers to Rhodesia will set America on a course not very different from our disastrous intervention in the Angolan civil war. We ignored the Afri\u00ad can realities in that case and paid dearly for our error. Must we repeat the per\u00ad formance in Rhodesia? The Soviets and the Cubans stand ready and able to reap the rewards of our folly in Rhode\u00ad sia. They, not the Rhodesian Govern\u00ad ment, would be the prime beneficiaries of our association with Ian Smith and company. All over black Africa, we are being watched. I think it would be a brilliant departure from our past be\u00ad havior to disappoint the Soviets and to maintain our policy of neutrality. We should acknowledge the strength of African nationalism, and stay away from the group which opposes it. We can maintain our hard-won credibility in black Africa. We can do the right thing. I fully realize that many Members of the Senate have lost patience with this interminable war. The administration has worked hard to broker a negotiated solution, but with no success. The war has intensified. Atrocities by both sides are appalling. I think that there is a strong desire here to find a short way out. With the patience of Congress stretched so thin, the inclination is to scramble for the nearest exit, to grasp at straws. I share some of these feelings. I, too, am impatient. I, too, want a quick solution and an end to the war. But the McGovern-Hayakawa resolution is not March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 6553 the answer. The real answer lies in U.N. supervised elections involving all the parties to the confict. The resolution 1s a well-intended, but in fact a risk-laden initiative taking the United States on the first step toward another foreign policy disaster in southern Africa. Please join me in opposition to Senate Concur\u00ad rent Resolution 8. I would also add, if I might, the ad\u00ad ministration had the same opposition in front of it and decided not to do it. So this initiative, indeed, would be by the Senate. I will close, Mr. President, by referring my colleagues to the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of March. 22, 1979, page 5943, where I had printed a letter to the Presi\u00ad dent signed by some 200 leaders of the civil rights group in the United States, labor, the Black Caucus, which goe~ into the elections and why, indeed, they are fraudulent.

Mr. President, I call upon this Cham\u00ad ber to look at this resolution closely and, hopefully, vote it down. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota and the Senator from california. Mr. McGOVERN addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. METZENBAUM). The Senator from South Dakota. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require. Mr. President, in all due respect to the junior Senator from Massachusetts <Mr. TsoNGAS), whom I admire very much, I cannot recall a speech here on the fioor of the Senate in a long time that was less relevant to the issue at stake than the remarks the Senator from Massachu\u00ad setts just made. They had no relevance at all to the resolution pending before the Senate. The import of the Senator's remarks is that the decision by the Foreign Re\u00ad lations Committee, a decision with only one dissenting vote, I might add, to sup\u00ad port the sending of impartial observers to Rhodesia was somehow an endorse\u00ad ment of the Smith government, somehow an endorsement of the election process itself. The committee and its resolution has made as clear as the English language can make it that this resolution is in no way a judgment on the election, on the Smith government, on the internal set\u00ad tlement, or any other parts. Quite the contrary, the purpose of this resolution is to try to make an impartial judgment about the nature of the elec\u00ad tion process. Let me read the language of the amendment itself: Congress intends that this assistance-- The sending of observers-- should in no way be regarded as implicit or explicit support by the U.S. Government of the provisions of the so-called internal settle\u00ad ment or of the Rhodesian Government. Mr. President, just to make doubly clear that there was nothing in this res\u00ad olution that could be interpreted by any fairminded person as an endorsement of either the election or the existing gov\u00ad ernment, Senator JAVITS offered this lan\u00ad guage, which was accepted unanimously by the committee and added to the resolution: Nothing contained in this resolution shall be deemed by implication or otherwise to in\u00ad dicate any determination as to the qualifica\u00ad tions of the elections or the Government, under section 27(2) of the International Security Assistance Act o! 1978. Mr. President, to compare a resolution of\u00b7 that kind, which calls upon this body to select professional impartial observers to help us make a judgment on a com\u00ad plicated foreign policy question-to com\u00ad pare that with the Gulf of Tonkin resolu\u00ad tion is ridiculous. The Gulf of Tonkin resolution was an action by this body which gave the President the authority to take military action as he saw fit any\u00ad where in southeast Asia. It has nothing to do with the resolution that would send nongovernment professional ob\u00ad servers to make a judgment as to the question of whether an election is valid in Rhodesia. It is clearly irrelevant to compare this to the covert paramilitary activity that was sent into Angola. It is all well and good for Senators to conjure up history, but let us be reason\u00ad able about it. There is no relevance at all to these scare words that have been used with reference to this resolution. The Senator from Massachusetts may argue-and I am inclined to agree with him-that the terms of the present elec\u00ad tion are not fair on the surface. How\u00ad ever, that is a judgment that he and I make. It is a judgment that is disputed by a good many Members of this body. Indeed, Senator DECONCINI and Sen\u00ad ator SCHWEIKER, two respected Members of the Senate, offered a resolution calling for the automatic lifting of sanc\u00ad tions 10 days after this election is held. I disagree with that resolution. However, I do not see how anyone can argue rea\u00ad sonably that sending observers, carefully picked for their impartiality and their professional skill, to advise us on the terms of this election could be construed as an endorsement of the Smith govern\u00ad ment or any other faction in Rhodesia. The practical situation we are going to face, once this election is held, if we do not have an observer team there, is a highly controversial situation in which claims and counterclaims will be made as to the validity of that election. The Senator from Massachusetts says that, in his judgment, the terms of the election make it invalid. That is one of the things that the observer team is called upon to evaluate. This is not sim\u00ad ply a matter, as the Senator from Massa\u00ad chusetts has implied, of looking at an election in Chicago to see who goes in the polling places and who does not. The observer team is charged with looking at all aspects of this election, including the structural conditions for the election, the constitutional framework in which it is held. I think there is a kind of implicit arro\u00ad gance in the argument by the Senator from Massachusetts that he can make a judgment about this election that should be accepted automatically by the Mem\u00ad bers of Congress and the executive branch. If it is possible for a Senator sitting in this Chamber to make a judg\u00ad ment that this election is structured in such a way that it is unfair and does not meet the terms of the Case-Javits lan\u00ad guage, it is not beyond the competence of an impartial team of 25 to 50 Ameri\u00ad cans, picked for their fairness and their competence, to come to the same con\u00ad clusion. It would not surprise me at all-al\u00ad though I do not think my friend and colleague from California shares this view-if that is precisely the conclusion to which the observer team comes. But I do not feel that it is up to me, as a Member of the U.S. Senate, to make that judgment and assume that any conclu\u00ad sion I draw about this election is auto\u00ad matically going to be accepted as the final word. The Senator from Massachusetts has argued that it is impractical to try to observe an election under the kind of turbulent conditions that exist in Rho-6554 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENA TE March 28, 1979 desia and that we cannot guarantee the safety of the people selected for this mission. Admittedly, Mr. President, it is not within the power of this body to guarantee the safety of observers who are sent to Rhodesia, any more than we could guarantee the safety of an am\u00ad bassador in Afghanistan or the safety of our embassy in Iran. There are dangers to Americans who are involved abroad in activities that are important to our for\u00ad eign policy. The committee has taken these mat\u00ad ters under careful consideration. We had a lengthy session with representatives of the State Department and the CIA pre\u00ad cisely for this purpose. We are going to explore carefully, under the terms of this resolution-and, I hope, the amendment I am planning to off er shortly-the se\u00ad curity arrangements that the Rhodesian Government has made. We are going to check out those security arrangements with our own security experts; and we think that, within reason, security can be provided for these observers. The Senator from Massachusetts has talked about the speed with which this resolution has been considered, compar\u00ad ing it again to the Gulf of Tonkin reso\u00ad lution. That resolution, as I recall, was brought to the committee one day, re\u00ad ported the next, and acted on here in the Senate the following day. This reso\u00ad lution is one I discussed with the Secre\u00ad tary of State in some depth as early as last December. We have had wide discussions about it in Congress. It has been pending in the Congress of the United States since March 1. We have had extensive hearings on it before the Foreign Relations Com\u00ad mittee and gave everyone who wanted to be heard on it an opportunity to be heard. We had follow-up discussions on it since that time. So we are not acting in great haste on this matter. As I indicated here earlier, I think the amendment builds very clearly on what is already the law of the land, and that is the so-called Case-Javits amendment that was adopted to the International Security Act last year. The Senator from Massachusetts has argued that the first of those conditions for the evaluation of sanctions-namely, the willingness of the Government of Rhodesia to negotiate in good faith at an all-parties conference under international auspices-has not been met. This resolution does not speak to that question. That is another totally irrelevant point. We make no effort, under the conditions of this observer team, to evaluate whether or not the Government of Rhodesia has demon\u00ad strated its willingness to negotiate in good faith. That is a judgment the Presi\u00ad dent of the United States will have to make. However, the second proviso of the Case-Javits language does call for the evaluation of the election \"with obser\u00ad vation by impartial internationally\u00ad recognized observers.\" The Case-Javits language was adopted by a solid margin in the Senate last fall. It calls for the observation of that elec\u00ad tion by impartial internationally-recog\u00ad nized observers; and the closest that we, as Members of this body, can come to dis\u00ad charging our obligation under that law is to take this carefully-planned step to send observers to report back to us on all the arrangements and the procedures for this election. Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi\u00ad dent, will the Senator from South Dakota yield for a question? Mr. McGOVERN. I yield to the Sena\u00ad tor from Virginia. Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi\u00ad dent, I feel that the Senator from South Dakota has made a very fair and ob\u00ad jective presentation of the resolution sponsored by the Senator from South Dakota and the Senator from California. My question to both Senators is this: They have made a fine case, I think, as to the importance of this resolution to the Case-Javits amendment which was enacted last year, but are not both Sen\u00ad ators concerned about the time element? Congress, as I recall, will adjourn for the Easter recess 2 weeks from today. The Senate ought not to be involved in a meaningless exercise. If the House does not have time to act then this en\u00ad tire effort will have been without any purpose whatsoever. In that event, I would think the Senate ought to be pre\u00ad pared to send its own delegation, per\u00ad haps Senators themselves should go. But the House of Representatives not having time to act on the resolution is a contingency for which the Senate should be fully prepared. The Senate should have its own plan of action to insure that our work today is not an empty gesture. But I am interested in the view of the distinguished Senator from South Dakota. Does the Senator from South Dakota in candor feel that the House of Repre\u00ad sentatives will have time to act on this resolution prior to the Easter recess? Mr. McGOVERN. I say to the Senator that obviously the House of Representa\u00ad tives would have time to act if they moved with some reasonable dispatch, but he is quite correct in being con\u00ad cerned about the timing because the election, as the Senator knows, has been announced for April 20, just about 3 weeks hence. So, assuming that the Sen\u00ad ate acts favorably on the resolution this afternoon, and the House of Represent\u00ad atives were to take it under considera\u00ad tion next week and were to move within a week's time, let us say, on the resolu\u00ad tion, I think that provides ample time for the leadership of the House of Rep\u00ad resentatives and Senate to select the two cochairpersons and they, in turn, to select the balance of the team in time to observe the Rhodesian election. I share the Senator's concern about the timing, but I do not think it is an impossible time frame for us to meet here in Congress. Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. I appreci\u00ad ate very much the Senator's assurance that ample time for House action is available. His remarks are reassuring, and I thank him. But if I could ask nevertheless one additional question, would the two spon\u00ad sors look favorably on an amendment to this resolution specifying that if the House of Representatives does not act, and assuming the Senate acts affirma\u00ad tively today, that the President pro tem\u00ad pore, as is provided by the resolution, would appoint a chairperson who, in turn, would make the other appointments of observers as the resolution provides? Or should that amendment be withheld in light of the view expressed that the House will have time to act? Mr. McGOVERN. I say to the Senator I can only speak for myself on that, but I would think that a bad precedent on a matter that is as obviously controversial as this. I think both the House of Repre\u00ad sentatives and the Senate ought to act on it. The proposal that the Senator made is one that went through my mind origi\u00ad nally thinking this might be something the Senate would want to undertake on its own in view of the special relationship that we bear to advising and consenting on foreign policy matters, but it is one that I think involves a fundamental question of American foreign policy. It involves an important decision affecting the whole country and our relationship to Rhodesia. I personally would be re\u00ad luctant to see this issue resolved by one body alone. Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. I think it would be better, of course, if both bodies were to act. I am very concerned, however, about the time element and whether the House of Representatives is in a position to act within a 2-week time frame. That is the reason I suggest acting in that fashion. The Senate would be as\u00ad sured of achieving at least part of what is sought by the resolution. But if the Senator is certain the House will be able to act in the time frame involved, I will defer to his judg\u00ad ment. Mr. McGOVERN. I appreciate the Senator's concerns, but I do think that if we move today to passage of this reso\u00ad lution, it is within the competence of the House of Representatives to move be\u00ad fore the Easter recess. Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Well, I also trust that the leadership in the House would see fit to give this matter the very high priority it deserves and that it requires in view of the short time available. But if the Senator will yield further, could I ask the Senator from California his view? Mr. HAYAKAWA. Yes; I, too, wish to \u00b7try to answer the question. I, too, would be reluctant for the Senate to go ahead by itself except for the fact that if the House of Representatives knowing that we have such a short time remaining before the election decides upon deliber\u00ad ately dilatory tactics to prevent any ac\u00ad tion on the matter, then we are left in the situation where we are frustrated, not by a decision of the House of Rep\u00ad resentatives but a decision of the sub\u00ad committee of the House of Representa\u00ad tives to drag its feet in coming to an important decision. If they come to a decision and defeat the idea, that is one thing, but if they just want to drag it out, then I am afraid that because of March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE 65'55 the limited time remaining we must act by ourselves, and, as I say, we will act by ourselves only with the greatest re\u00ad gret, but, goodness, there is no way to fight simply dilatory tactics. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point? Mr. HAYAKAWA. I am happy to yield. Mr. McGOVERN. I have to say, in good humor, that I do not think the history of our own body here has been such that we can lecture the House of Representatives too strenuously on dila\u00ad tory tactics, and just as a practical mat\u00ad ter I would have to say I do not think we would expedite action in the House of Representatives if we were to hold over their heads the threat of unilateral ac\u00ad tion here in the Senate. The House of Representatives has ways of moving ex\u00ad peditiously when they are dealing with a matter that they think is in the na\u00ad tional interest. They sometimes move with greater speed than we do even though they are a much larger body. So while I appreciate the good faith of the Senator from Virginia in trying to move something under a limited time frame, I would just have to say that for myself I would have to resist an amendment of that kind. Mr. TSONGAS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point? Mr. McGOVERN. Yes, I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts . Mr. TSONGAS. Is there any prec\u00ad edent for the Senate taking unilateral action on an issue of foreign policy? Mr. McGOVERN. I do not think there is any precedent for either the Senate or the House of Representatives acting in the tradition that we are proposing here in this amendment. I will say to the Senator, I am not aware of any precedent. Mr. TSONGAS. I wish to express a concern beyond the issue. However we may come down on this particular con\u00ad cern, if we do indeed set a precedent where the Senate would have, if the House of Representatives does not move in a particular direction, our own for\u00ad eign policy, I think that would be met with appropriate chuckles from the world community. Mr. McGOVERN. I agree with the Senator. I think also I see this observer team as :flowing logically from the Case\u00ad Ja vits language that was passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate last year. While that was the Senate initiative it was approved by the conference committee and ratified by both the House of Representatives and the Senate. So I think we would be better advised to deal with the issue on its own merits and let the House of Repre\u00ad sentatives do the same. The Senator from North Carolina asked me some time ago if I would yield to him. How much time does the Sena\u00ad tor wish? Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I say to the able Senator if he could spare 10 minutes-- Mr. McGOVERN. I yield 10 minutes. Mr. HELMS. I wonder if I might ask him if he would be willing to yield first to the distinguished Senator from Penn-sylvania and then to the Senator from Massachusetts each of whom has a statement. Mr. McGOVERN. I yield to the Sena\u00ad ator from Pennsylvania. Mr. SCHWEIKER. I thank the Sena\u00ad tor. Mr. President, this resolution is too lit\u00ad tle but to avoid the possibility of its also being too late, I shall refrain from offer\u00ad ing as an amendment the provisions of Senate Concurrent Resolution 7 which I introduced February 9 with my distin\u00ad guished colleague from Arizona <Mr. DE\u00ad CoNcrnr). The resolution before us, Sen\u00ad ate Concurrent Resolution 8, is only half a loaf. But I fear trying to make it whole by adding the provisions of Senate Concurrent Resolution 7 might delay acceptance of any resolution and we might end up not with half a loaf but with no loaf. In testimony March 7 before the Com\u00ad mittee on Foreign Relations, I outlined the compelling reasons for having Con\u00ad gress recognize at once the progress al\u00ad ready made in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia and set up a firm timetable for the lifting of sanctions following the installation of a black majority government chosen at free elections. I ask unanimous consent to print at the end of these remarks my March 7 testimony arguing in favor of the adoption of Senate Congressional Resolution 7. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered. <See exhibit 1.) Mr. SCHWEIKER. Mr. President, as the preamble to the resolution before us today, (S. Con. Res. 8) notes, the con:flict in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia has reached a critical stage. There is no assurance that the April 20 elections to install a black majority government will reduce that conflict. However, the case may be made in both precedent and principle that this Con\u00ad gress should dispatch observers to satisfy ourselves of the validity of the balloting. What we have there is a transitional government, employing a democratic process, however imperfect, to cast off the shackles of colonialism. But the Carter administration seems to take the position that guerrilla war\u00ad fare must continue until all factions agree to come to the peace table-if in\u00ad deed, there is anyone left to do so. The so-called Patriotic Front, which demands the reins of government with\u00ad out elections, publicly considers armed force as the only arbiter of political dif\u00ad ferences. Are we diplomatically on dead-center because the guerrillas in Zimbabwe-Rho\u00ad desia ref use to take their chances at the ballot box in a free election? Granted, there is some temporary im\u00ad balance toward the white minority in this proposed transition. But the Constitution corrects that warp in a decade. This provision also has been the pat\u00ad tern in Africa as one-time colonies achieved independence. When Tanzania was created, 30 percent of the seats went to 1 percent of the population. In Kenya, 30 percent of the seats went to 4 percent. In Zambia, half of the 30 parliamentary seats were reserved for 84,000 Europeans, and half went to 3 % million blacks. Such provisions often are essential during the crucial transition period. Any democratic transition to majority rule in a country that has not had it faces many dangers thait do not concern an autocracy. Democracy tries to win the minds of men, not their bodies. In my testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee, I pointed out that a new black majority government in Zimbab\u00ad we-Rhodesia cannot long withstand in\u00ad action from supporters of a democratic and prosperous nation there. The United States should recognize the efforts which have been made by the transitional government in accordance with the International Security Assis\u00ad tance Act of 1978. The dispatch of observers will increase the stakes for successful completion of the democratic transition. This resolution is less than I hoped for, but may demonstrate this Congress' public concern for Zimbabwe-Rho\u00ad desia's struggle toward democratic inde\u00ad pendence. EXHIBIT 1 FOREIGN COMMITrEE Mr. Cha.irma.n a.nd members of the com\u00ad mittee: I a.pprecia.te the opportunity ito tes\u00ad tify today on behalf of Senate Concurrent Resolution 7 which Sena.tor DECONCINI a.nd I have introduced concerning the termina\u00ad tion by the United States of Sanctions against Zimbabwe-Rhodesia.. This resolution must be evaluated in the light of the transition to a. black majority government in that country, a.s embodied in the Salisbury agreement of March, 1978. The Zimbabwe-Rhodesia tra.nsitiona.l gov\u00ad ernment ha.s remained steadfast in seeking a. democratic transfer of power to the black majority through free elections on April 20, 1979, despite interna.tlona.l opposition and guerrilla harassment . This historic resullt satisfies the self-deter\u00ad mination goals of many Zimbabwe-Rho\u00ad desian citizens who have opposed an en\u00ad trenched white minority rule for so m.a.ny years. It would be especially tragic 1! the United States displayed less than full support to a. fledgling constitutional democracy on a. con\u00ad tinent where other governments are pre\u00ad dominantly a.utocra.tic and where tribal rivalries and foundering post-colonial socie\u00ad ties a.re ripe for exploitation by antidemo\u00ad cratic forces. Terrorist brutality perpetrated by the self\u00ad proclaimed Patriotic Front is bl.lit a. prelude to a.n \"orgy of destruction\" vowed by front colea.der Joshua Nkomo against those who dare to vote in the democratic elections-or even those who approve a. settlement noit based on the front's terms. The so-called Patriotic Front has flatly re\u00ad buffed the transitional government's invita\u00ad tion to resolve its confilcts at an all-parties conference. Obviously, the front considers armed force the most reliable and persuasive arbiter of political differences-like the bully who tries to win a. lost argument with his fists-and the front knows it cannot win at the polls April 20. The Anglo-American reconcUlation plan among the parties ls essentially defunct. Great Brita.in and the United States appar\u00ad ently have opted to allow the escalating mili\u00ad tary conflict to resolve itself--or at least strengthen the chances of compromise. But time a.nd events have shown that guerrllla. leaders a.re deeply divided by tribal, personal and ideological schisms. Many fear that the 6556 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE March 28, 1979 accession to power of the guerrmas would trigger a far more destructive civil war. Furthermore, the ostensibly neutral policy pursued by London and Washington in maintaining sanctions to secure a peace has clearly hurt Salisbury economically. It is not being helped by an insurrection fed by arms and money from foreign powers hostile to democracy. So far, both nations have also spurned the transitional government's invitation to send observers to monitor the elections , even when that action ls consistent with the present law. Anglo-American reluctance to encourage a black majority government election seems even more puzzling when considering the stance and strength of the guerlllas . They have demanded an outright concession of power. They have the ablllty to disrupt the elections and endanger a new government-\u00ad a serious implication for Western interests in critical South Africa. Has the United States no alternative to passive observance of a developing blood\u00ad bath? Are we stuck with a defunct policy that at least tacitly encourages antidemo\u00ad cratic forces to overtly reject the very values we hope to see promoted in Zlmbabwe\u00ad Rhodesla? I do not believe that. Congressional aware\u00ad ness and response to the perilous situation in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia ls imperative now\u00ad llttle more than a month before the elections . Timing ls critical. It is useless to ask a man-or a nation-to roll up his sleeves and go to work when he has just lost his shirt. A resolute indication of support for a con\u00ad stitutional settlement has never been more necessary. It is the best means of assuring those who have accepted the risk that the transitional process ls warranted and their perseverance justified. Congress directed in section 27 of the In\u00ad ternational Security Assistance Act of 1978 that sanctions against Zimbabwe-Rhodesia not be enforced upon a presidential deter\u00ad mination that, 1. The transitional government of Zim\u00ad babwe-Rhodesia had demonstrated its will\u00ad ingness to participate in, and negotiate in good faith on all relevant issues, at an all\u00ad parties conference held under international auspices and, 2. A government has been installed in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia which was chosen by free elections observed by impartial outsiders, and in which all political and population groups were allowed to participate freely. The Schwelker-DeConcini resolution de\u00ad clares the finding of Congress that the transi\u00ad tional government lhas indeed complied with the first precondition in section 27. This res\u00ad olutolon expresses the sense of Congress that the President, not later than ten days after the installation of the black majority govern\u00ad ment pursuant to such elections, should determine that the second pre-condition has been met; and should not enforce sanc\u00ad tions. Prompt passage of this resolution will pro\u00ad vide a strong psychological inducement to complete the transitional process. It would symbolize now recognl ti on by the United States Congress that tJhe transitional gov\u00ad ernment seeks a peaceful transfer of power to the black majority. Moreover, this resolu\u00ad tion would convey now to all concerned par\u00ad ties that we have an abiding interest in a democratic Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. There ls a crl ti cal, and I belil.eve necessary distinction between the Schweiker-DeCon\u00ad clnl resolution and the thrust of section 27. Grave conditions in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia make undue executive discretion in deter\u00ad mination of compliance short-sighted. By posing a reasonable and certain time frame for this determination, this resolution rec\u00ad ognizes that the economic and political sur\u00ad vival of a new black majority government cannot long withstand inaction from sup-porters of a democratic and prosperous Zim\u00ad babwe-Rhodesia. Communicating tJhose in\u00ad tentions now provides every reasonable centive to Salisbury to comply with the re\u00ad maining pre-condition. It would increase the stakes for successful completion of the demo\u00ad cratic transition. The Democratic transition to black majority rule in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia clearly faces many dangers. Yet those who are mak\u00ad ing the per1lous effort must be assured that tt ts worth the price, possibly in lives. It ls small wonder that reasonable people ask whether penalizing the Salisbury adminis\u00ad tra tlon with sanctions while doing little to discourage the guer1llas makes sense. If a constitutional democracy incorporat\u00ad ing black majority rule falls now, or foun\u00ad ders because the United States does not ac\u00ad tively support a timely lifting of its sanc\u00ad tions, there ls a strong probab111ty that Zimbabwe-Rhodesia ultimately wm be ruled by forces hostile to the West and to demo\u00ad cratic concepts. It ls for these reasons, which I will be glad to elaborate upon in response to your questions, that I ask that this resolution be reported out of the Foreign Relations Com\u00ad mittee promptly for full consideration. This situation in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia de\u00ad mands that Congress speak out now on this critical issue. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator from North Carolina was kind enough to indicate I might proceed for maybe 4 minutes. I am wondering who is handling the time of those who are op\u00ad posed to the resolution or whether either Senator will be good enough to yield time. Mr. McGOVERN. Does the Senator wish time yielded now? Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. The Senator from North Carolina indicated that it would be acceptable. Mr. McGOVERN. How much time does the Senator wish? Mr. KENNEDY . Five minutes. Mr. McGOVERN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last summer I voted against all the amend\u00ad ments which were offered either by the Senators from North Carolina or actually by the Senators from New York and New Jersey, the Javits-Case amendment. I was opposed to all such unilateral ac\u00ad tions by the United States, taken in derogation of our international obliga\u00ad tions. And I am opposed to the proposals of Senators HAYAKAWA and McGOVERN to send an observer team to monitor the elections scheduled to be held in Rho\u00ad desia on April 20. The reasons for opposing such pro\u00ad posals in the past remain equally valid today. The United States and Great Britain have consistently taken the position that no solution, no settlement, nor any elec\u00ad tion can work if it does not have the support and consent of the people of Rhodesia as a whole. The scheduled elections cannot meet that test. Black Rhodesians, who constitute 97 percent of the population, have been given no opportunity to vote on the con\u00ad stitution under which these elections are being held. Indeed there is every rea\u00ad son to believe that they would reject this constitution. The Commission for Justice and Peace of Rhodesia has recently made this judgment: The Salisbury agreement of March 3, 1978 does not guarantee a genuine transfer of power to the African majority, nol' does it provide any mechanism, such as a referen\u00ad dum, to ascertain whether the African ma\u00ad jority accepted it. The right of rejection was reserved, typically, to the whites. The agree\u00ad ment retains firmly in white hands effective mmtary and economic power, as well as ef\u00ad fective control over the civil service and the judiciary ... to state that .the agreement does not transfer power from the white mi\u00ad nority to the black majority ls indeed too mild; the agreement ensures that no such transfer shall take place. (Rhodesia After the Internal Settlement, p. 4-6) Free elections cannot be held without free participation by all of the parties that have popular followings. The two nationalist wings of the Patriotic Front, Zapu and Zanu, have been banned since September. More than 300 of their lead\u00ad ers are in jail. More than 2,000 political prisoners remain in jail notwithstanding promises of amnesty. The Patriotic Front and other opposition organizations can neither engage in full political campaign\u00ad ing and activities nor publish their views. Access to radio and television is con\u00ad trolled by the Government. Press reports are heavily censored. Free elections cannot be held in con\u00ad ditions of insecurity and intimidation. Without a ceasefire and the establish\u00ad ment of security in which the population of Rhodesia can make genuine choices, there cannot be a truly free election-90 percent of Rhodesia is now under martial law, and power flows only from the gun in these circumstances. The Patriotic Front forces intend to disrupt an election process which they see as prejudicial and exclusionary. Pri\u00ad vate armies roam the countryside \"teach\u00ad ing people to vote\" by intimidation. Such an electoral process is not legiti\u00ad mate. It cannot work, it cannot end the war because it does not remove the cause of the war, a government based on racial privilege and intimidation, and not on the consent of the governed. No other country will be sending ob\u00ad servers. The U.N. Security Council of which we are members has asked member nations not to do so. If we do send observers, the interna\u00ad tional community will accuse us of lend\u00ad ing legitimacy to an illegal process. We will once again be thumbing our nose at the world, siding with South Africa in violating international legal obligations as we did when we passed the Byrd amendment. Steps that seem tiny can turn out to be giant leaps. What arrangements are going to be made to protect the safety of these ob\u00ad servers if they wish to see all of the country and not just what the Govern\u00ad ment of Rhodesia's security forces allow them to see? What if one of our observ\u00ad ers should lose his or her life? Who will accept the liability and the responsibility for that? During committee markup, the senior Senator from New York seemed to advo\u00ad cate the use of American defense equip\u00ad ment and forces to secure their safety. March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 6557 But is this wise? Is this not likely to deepen our involvement in this tragic war without assisting in its resolution? The Senator from New York also seemed to favor not simply observers but military supplies to a new and allegedly democratic Government in Rhodesia. This is a dangerous line of thought, with incalculable consequences for our in\u00ad volvement on the side of the minority in Southern Africa. The involvement of the United States in such an electoral process-widely re\u00ad garded throughout Africa and much of the world as unrepresentative, indeed farcical-would do great harm to our credibility and our prestige. It would se\u00ad riously jeopardize our future status as an impartial mediator. These judgments reflect the attitudes of members of the Salisbury government itself. Recently five ministers resigned from that government. For example, In\u00ad ternal Affairs Cominister Ndweni said: \"My people have demanded I resign and call for the immediate return of Nkomo.\" Foreign Affairs Cominister Gabellah said: \"I can no longer reconcile my con\u00ad science with certain actions by which <Mr. Sithole's party) seeks to promote support for itself.\" Mr. Ahrn Paley resigned as constitu\u00ad tional legal adviser to Bishop Muzorewa precisely because the new constitution perpetuates white domination and offers the majority of the population no sub\u00ad stantive change from their present position. Mr. President, we need to adhere to our principles in this matter. I welcome the March 17 statement by Secretary of State Vance. He called upon the parties to accept the principle of United Nations supervised elections in Rhodesia and to negotiate the conditions for holding such elections. He said: The crucial poln t ls the acceptance of the principle of internationally supervised elec\u00ad tions as the only way to avoid protracted and damaging war. I believe Secretary Vance is right. The fundamental basis for any lasting solu\u00ad tion in Rhodesia is a free and unfettered election process. For this reason I intend to vote against the current resolution. It is contrary to the obligations and dan\u00ad gerous to the interests of the United States. I thank the Senator from South Da\u00ad kota and the Senator from North Carolina. Mr. McGOVERN. I yield now 10 min\u00ad utes to the Senator from North Carolina. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen\u00ad ator from South Dakota only has 5 min\u00ad utes left on his resolution. The Senator from California has 20 minutes left. Mr. HAYAKAWA. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from North Caro\u00ad lina how much time he needs. How much time does the Senator need? Mr. HELMS. I think I would like to have 10 minutes total or 11 and I will be as brief as possible. Mr. HAYAKAWA. I yield that time to the Senator on my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen\u00ad ator from North Carolina. Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as the two able sponsors of this resolution, the dis-tinguished Senator from South Dakota <Mr. McGOVERN) and the distinguished Senator from California <Mr. HAYA\u00ad KAWA) both know, the Senator from North Carolina would much prefer the lifting of all sanctions against Rhodesia right now. There is absolutely no valid reason for maintaining sanctions of any kind against the present Government of Rho\u00ad desia. In fact, I wonder how many other nations in Africa have the freedoms that Rhodesians enjoy today. With the elec\u00ad tions coming up, and Rhodesia making its move toward becoming a multiracial government based on democratic princi\u00ad ples, I wonder if any other African state can boast of being more pure in its pur\u00ad suit of democratic rule than Rhodesia. So why do we persist in maintaining sanctions? The U.S. State Department's attitude toward the current attempt by Rhodesia to move toward a multiracial democ\u00ad racy is odd indeed. The State Department takes-and has taken-the position that Rhodesia can do no right, if we judge by the unyielding standards set by the ideo\u00ad logues running the executive branch's Rhodesia policy. The State Department attitude is in\u00ad excusable; it is a stupid policy, with no recognition of the realities in Africa and Rhodesia. It is a narrow-minded view, tilting fully toward the so-called Patri\u00ad otic Front, whose guerrilla tactics the State Department is incredibly, implic\u00ad itly, supporting. No other view can be taken of this weird posture of our State Department. Therefore, I feel that sanctions should be lifted immediately, just as I did last July, when a measure I introduced to do just that came within only a few votes of passage in the Senate. As it was, the Senate decided, instead, to adopt the Case-Javits amendment to my amendment. That amendment stated, and I quote: In furtherance of the foreign pollcy inter\u00ad ests of the United States, the Government of the United States shall not enforce sanc\u00ad tions against Rhodesia after December 31, 1978, provided that the President determines that-- ( 1) the Government of Rhodesia has demonstrated its wlllingness to negotiate in good faith at an all-parties conference, held under international auspices, on all relevant issues; and (2) a government has been installed, chosen by free elections in which all political and population groups have been allowed to participate freely, with observation by impartial, internationally-recognized ob\u00ad servers. Mr. President, I say again while I would pref er that the Senate vote to lift sanctions today, I am willing to par\u00ad ticipate in this attempt to fulfill the con\u00ad ditions of the Case-Javits amendment to my measure to lift sanctions. I am willing to participate, because I feel that this is a good faith attempt on the part of the Senate to implement Case-Javits, in spite of numerous im\u00ad pediments thrown in the path of its eventual success by the State Depart\u00ad ment and certain members of the House of Representatives. \u00b7 Mr. President, in all candor I must say the State Department has not acted in good faith in carrying out the terms of Case-Javits. The Senate ought to take due note of that. Rather, its policy has been to throw up roadblocks all along the way. The first operative condition set out in Case-Javits is that Rhodesia demon\u00ad strate a willingness to negotiate in good faith in an all-parties conference. Mr. President, there can be no ques\u00ad tion, no question whatsoever, that Rho\u00ad desia has demonstrated that willingness, and continues to do so. Of course Rho\u00ad desia has. Even the State Department has reluctantly admitted this fact over and over again to me and to others and to members of my staff. This is quite an admission 1by the State Department since the State Department has abandoned the all-parties conference plan. In fact, the State Department was forced to do so because the Patriotic Front has re\u00ad fused to participate. Not only have they refused to participate unless certain conditions are placed on the confer\u00ad ence-hardly dealing in good faith-they have flatly refused to participate. So where does that leave us, Mr. President? When the members of the Interim Government, Mr. Smith, Rev. Muzorewa, Rev. Sithole, and Mr. Chirau, visited the United States last year, I urged strong\u00ad ly that they seek an all-parties confer\u00ad ence immediately. Frankly, Mr. Presi\u00ad dent, I would have preferred to have the conference here, in the United States, where all parties would have access to a free and inquiring press, and where the interim Government could sit down with the Patriotic FTont relatively free from pressure from outside influences. Here, I refer to the Patriotic Front's allies, the so-called f.rontline states: The socialist state of Zambia; the socialist state of Tanzania, now itself engaged in an armed invasion of another black African state; the Marxist state of Angola; the Marxist state of Mozambique; and Bot\u00ad swana. Also, pressure from the ideologues at the State Department could be coun\u00ad tered by a watchful Congress. Unfortunately, that meeting never took place. Why? Because Mr. Nkomo refused to come, as did Mr. Mugabe. So much for the workings of the first part of Case-Javits.The Rhodesians still stand ready for an all-parties confer\u00ad ence, although with an election coming up, it is pretty late in the day for such a conference. In the meantime, one major part of Case-Javits is frustrated\u00ad and not by the Rhodesian Government. And so we come to the second test of Case-Javits: Free elections internation\u00ad ally supervised. Today, the Senate seeks to insure that the elections will, indeed, be free. It seeks to do so by providing proper internation\u00ad al supervision of those elections. A team from the United States would join ob\u00ad server teams from Germany and Britian and other European nations in observing the Rhodesian electoral process. How free will these elections be? Who can say? The Senator from South Dakota put his finger on that question: It is a mat\u00ad ter of judgment, and it is an objective judgment at best. 6558 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE March 28, 1979 Will they be as free from defect as elections held in established democra\u00ad cies like the United States, or England, or France or Germany? Certainly, we would desire that. But Rhodesia has no long tradition of elections for all the people, something which can be said about just about every other nation in Africa as well, if indeed they have elec\u00ad tions. But at least Rhodesia is trying to move toward democracy. So I trust that the standard to which Rhodesia will be held will take into account the nature of the attempt being made in such good faith by the Interim Government. I will conclude in a moment. But what concerns me, Mr. President, 1s that the second test of Case-Javits well may be frustrated also. Already, the chairman of the African Affairs Subcommittee of the House Com\u00ad mittee on Foreign Affairs is said to be planning to see that the McGovern-Ha\u00ad yakawa resolution never sees the light of day. Additionally, the State Depart\u00ad ment has made its position abundant\u00ad ly clear: it does not wish to see this im\u00ad portant legislation, this keeping of faith with the Case-Javits Act, take place. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point? Mr. HELMS. Yes. Mr. McGOVERN. In all fairness to the administration, while they have not seen fit to send an administration \u00b7 observer team, they have remained neutral on the question of the Congress sending an ob\u00ad server team. So I think in fairness to them, they have testified on the record publicly very clearly that they are not opposing this pending resolution. Mr. HELMS. Well, as the Senator knows--or maybe he did not attend the closed session of the committee-a some\u00ad what different position was taken. But I would be willing to accept what the Senator says as the State Department's position, if indeed they will follow through on it. Mr. McGOVERN. I did attend all the sessions. The Senator is correct that in the initial presentation, they seemed to concentrate on the idea of an observer team without drawing a distinction be\u00ad tween a congressional observer team and an administration team. Their testi\u00ad mony, if the Senator will review it, was centered, really, on the reasons why they did not feel the administration could participate in the establishment and dis\u00ad patch of an observer team. But on further reflection, when they were further interrogated about that provision in the committee, both in ex\u00ad ecutive session and open session, they made clear that they were not opposing this resolution, and I think the Senator will not find anywhere where they are on record against this resolution. Mr. TSONGAS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. HELMS. I want to finish my state\u00ad ment, and I do not know how much more time the managers of the resolution will allow me to have. Mr. TSONGAS. For a 10-second in\u00ad quiry? Mr. HELMS. All right. Mr. TSONGAS. The Senator made reference to an observer team, that there were observers from West Germany and France and Great Britain. I was not aware that that was taking place. Were there national teams sent by those coun\u00ad tries? Mr. HELMS. That is a fact, I would say to the Senator, by the Conservative Party in Britain and an equivalent group in Germany. Mr. TSONGAS. But there was no na\u00ad tional team sent by the existing Govern\u00ad ments in power in any of those coun\u00ad tries? Mr. HELMS. Well, it is a recognized official team. The PRESIDING OFFICER <Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR.) . The Senator's 10 minutes have expired. Mr. HELMS. I wonder if I could have 2 more minutes from the Senator from California? Mr. HAYAKAWA. I am glad to yield the Senator 2 more minutes. Can he finish in a minute and a half? Other Senators are waiting in line. Mr. HELMS. I will be glad to try. I say to my friends in the House of Representatives, and warn the State De\u00ad partment, that if the intent and actual operation of Case-Javits is frustrated, I see no recourse but to move quickly in the Senate with the original intent of my measure which was amended by Case-J a vi ts. Thus, I will be left with little recourses but to find an appropriate vehicle and move to lift sanctions immediately. Un\u00ad til that time, I intend to do all that I properly can to gain passage of the measure we consider today. Perhaps, too, if the will of the Senate is frustrated, a private group of U.S. citizens may be willing to undertake to become observers of the election in Rho\u00ad desia. I am aware of efforts under way even now to do so. But this is all speculation for the moment. It all depends on how the House of Representatives deals with this concurrent resolution, if it is passed by the Senate, which I assume it will be. I thank the Senator from California. Mr. HAYAKAWA. Mr. President, I yield a minute and a half, if that will be sufficient, to the distinguished Senator from Iowa. Mr. JEPSEN. Mr. President, I com\u00ad pliment the distinguished Senator from South Dakota <Mr. McGOVERN) and the distinguished Senator from California (Mr. HAYAKAWA). They have indeed, by their actions and their persistence, of\u00ad fered hope to the freedom loving and Christian people throughout the world in offering this prudent yet very im\u00ad portant gesture to a people who want to be free, a people who have met every test, every criterion, and every require\u00ad ment that has been imposed or given or dictated to them over the years, and now are about to take a vital step with elec\u00ad tions. The distinguished Senator from North Carolina <Mr. HELMS) stated that the Patriotic Front, the guerrillas, the Marxists, call them what you may, re\u00ad fused to participate. Not only did they refuse to participate, but Nkomo said he \"turned the ballot boxes into battle\u00ad fields.\" The distinguished Senator from Mes-sachusetts <Mr. KENNEDY) said, \"We want free and unfettered elections; we don't want to get involved.\" Mr. President, if we do not want to get involved, why do we have sanctions against Rhodesia? We are involved. We have heard it said that we do not want to be on the wrong side. Well, one way to get out of there, and not be on the wrong side, is to lift those sanctions. I find it strange that we find fault with our friends and give aid and comfort to our enemies. I would like to close, Mr. President, by quoting what I think is a very common\u00ad sense editorial, which puts it all into per\u00ad spective, without emotion, in words that prudent and rational people can under\u00ad stand. This editorial was published in the Washington Post of March 3, 1979: Fortunately, others perceive the difference between observing an election and endorsing its results: They go on to state: How can a democratic country not meas\u00ad ure the democratic performance of another country asking to be measured? How can the United States set a !air-elections test on sanctions and not see how it ls passed? I thank the Senator for yielding. Mr. HAY AKA WA. I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from South Carolina <Mr. THURMOND). Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the concurrent reso\u00ad lution (S. Con. Res. 8) to provide for impartial observance of the forthcoming elections in Rhodesia. My support and cosponsorship of this resolution stems from my firm belief in the democratic form of government. The United States should not prescribe what form of constitutional structure the people of Rhodesia are to follow, but rather, we should respect and protect the right of the Rhodesian people to practice their politics freely and openly and to exercise their rights of self-determina\u00ad tion without any intimidation from any source. Free elections with universal suf\u00ad frage will remain hollow slogans unless in practice they are implemented com\u00ad pletely in the open and exposed to public scrutiny. The Rhodesian Government has taken steps to preserve these objectives by inviting impartial observers to moni\u00ad tor the upcoming election in that country. Mr. President, the brevity of my re\u00ad marks in no way reflects upon the com\u00ad plexity of a solution to the Rhodesian situation. The transition to majority rule with minority rights is to be implemented through an election set for April 20, 1979. Following that election, a black govern\u00ad ment is to be installed in Rhodesia and a new constitution effected. Those changes stem from an internal agree\u00ad ment concluded between Prime Minister Ian Smith and three black leaders who command majority support-Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the Reverend Ndabaningi Si thole and Chief J erimiah Chirau. Some terrorists, the so-called Patriotic Front, alleged to be of Marxist ideology and backed by the Soviets, refused to participate in the negotiation of this in\u00ad ternal agreement, and have avowed to continue their guerrilla war from bases in neighboring countries and disrupt the April 20 elections. March 28, 19'79 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENA TE 6559 The issue thus becomes clear-shall the transition in Rhodesia take place by the ballot box or by the gun? Mr. Presi\u00ad dent, I strongly believe in the democratic process of government and thus fully support the free and open election to take place in Rhodesia. The obstacles faced by the Rhodesian people are seemingly almost insurmount\u00ad able. Some criticize that the proposed constitution does not establish a perfect, one-man-one-vote regime. It provides for 29 white seats in a legislature of 100. But this idea is endorsed by the black party leaders, who believe it will help insure a smooth transition and discourage the white minority from leaving Rhodesia which would have disastrous economic consequences. In any event, the United States should not interfere in such inter\u00ad nal matters that are part of a nego\u00ad tiated agreement that is ratified by a ma\u00ad jority of the people of Rhodesia in a free and open election. One final observation should be made. Section 27 of the International Security Assistance Act of 1978 as enacted into law <Public Law 96-384) provides that: SEC. 27. In furtherance of the foreign pol\u00ad icy interests of the United States, the Gov\u00ad ernment of the United States shall not en\u00ad force sanctions against Rhodesia after De\u00ad cember 31, 1978, provided that the President determines that- ( 1) the Government of Rhodesia has dem\u00ad onstrated willingness to negotiate in good faith at an all-parties conference, held un\u00ad der international auspices, in all relevant is\u00ad sues; and (2) a government has been installed, chosen population groups have been allowed to participate freely, with observation by im\u00ad partial, internationally organized observers. Sending an impartial observer team would aid the President in fulfilling the mandate of this section by providing the U.S. Government with accurate, im\u00ad partial, and firsthand information. It should be noted that section 5 of the resolution states: Nothing contained in this resolution shall be deemed by implication or otherwise to in\u00ad dicate any determination as to the qualifica\u00ad tions of the elections or the government, under section 27(2) of the International Se\u00ad curity Assistance Act of 1978. In sum, Mr. President, I give my un\u00ad equivocal support to the people of Rho\u00ad desia as they earnestly attempt to settle their differences by a fair and impartial election rather than by warfare. The very least the United States can do to help insure a peaceful transition is to pro\u00ad vide an impartial team to observe this election. I, there! ore, intend to vote for Senate Concurrent Resolution 8 and urge my colleagues to also support this resolu\u00ad tion. Mr. HAYAKAWA. I thank the Sen\u00ad ator from South Carolina. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the Senator from Utah <Mr. HATCH) be included as a cosponsor of Senate Concurrent Resolution 8. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Who yields time? The Senator from South Dakota. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, I yield myself a couple of minutes of time. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the committee amendments be considered and agreed to en bloc. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none. It is so ordered. The committee amendments were agreed to en bloc. UP AMENDMENT NO. 57 (Purpose: To make provision for payment of additional expenses , including private se\u00ad curity advisors to the observer team, com\u00ad munications, rental of equipment, and miscellaneous administrative costs) Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, earlier I spoke about an amendment to the reso\u00ad lution which would have the effect of authorizing an additional $75,000 to cover the cost of private security advisors for the observer team. I would hope this would help, at least 1n part, to satisfy the concern that some Senators have expressed about the safely of these observers. It 1s a matter that grew out of the rather lengthy discussion that members of the Foreign Relations Committee had with representatives from the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency. It would have the effect of increasing the total authoriza\u00ad tion for this entire operation to $250,000. I move the adoption of this amend\u00ad ment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be stated. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Mc\u00ad GOVERN) proposes an unprinted amendment numbered 57. On page 4, line 16, strike out \"$175,000\" and insert in lieu thereof \"$250,000.\" Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, I move the adoption of the amendment. Mr. TSONGAS. Mr. President, I will not delay my colleagues on this issue. I would just like to be recorded in op\u00ad position. I think it is a well-intentioned gesture, but I think perhaps given the armies available to both the guerrillas, the Patriotic Front, and the various factions, this amendment is too little and too late. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amend\u00ad ment. The amendment was agreed to. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, how much time remains? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen\u00ad ator from South Dakota has 2 minutes remaining and the Senator from Cali\u00ad fornia has 3 minutes remaining. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, in view of the lateness of the hour I do not propose to delay the Senate any longer. I think the arguments which can be made pro and con have already been made. I just want to stress again that after carefully considering this resolu\u00ad tion the Senate Foreign Relations Com\u00ad mittee saw fit to report it to the fioor with only one dissenting vote. It came out of the committee not only with strong bipartisan support but, to the best of my recognition, with the strong support of the committee as a whole, save for one vote. I think it is in the national interest of the United States. Mr. TSONGAS. Will the Senator yi~ld for a moment? Mr. McGOVERN. Yes. Mr. TSONGAS. Just as a point of clari\u00ad fication, I think it is true that Senator SARBANES, Senator GLENN, and Senator ZORINSKY conveyed their opposition to the vote. I just wanted that in the RECORD. Mr. McGOVERN. That may be. That may have been done after the vote. They were apparently not in the committee room when the vote was taken. How\u00ad ever, I do not dispute what the Senator has said. Nevertheless, I think this concurrent resolution is broadly based. I think it fol\u00ad lows naturally from the Case-Javits language, which is already the law of the land. I would hope that the concur\u00ad rent resolution will be overwhelmingly adopted here today. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? The yeas and nays were ordered. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. Mr. HAYAKAWA. Mr. President, I do not need 3 minutes, though I have that remaining. I want to say that what has brought Senator McGOVERN and I to\u00ad gether in this unusual alliance is the fact that both of us went to Rhodesia. There are certain things that one observes there which have brought us to this agreement in spite of our many disagreements. It is an experience I would recommend very strongly to others. Rhodesia is a beautiful and fascinat\u00ad ing country, though heartbreakingly torn up. I would urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution. e Mr. STEVENSON. Mr. President, it seems to me a serious mistake for the United States to involve itself directly in the forthcoming Rhodesian elections. I understand the desire of the sponsors, in light of the Case-Javits amendment to the International Security Assistance Act of 1978, to obtain as complete infor\u00ad mation as possible about these elections. These elections could have an impor\u00ad tant bearing on any decision of the United States with respect to the lifting of the United Nations sanctions now be\u00ad ing imposed on Rhodesia. In all candor, I must say that I have grave doubts about the ability of some 25 to 50 as yet-unidentified Americans, regardless of their individual compe\u00ad tence, to provide reliable, accurate, and comprehensive information about\u00b7 an election in a war-torn and divided coun\u00ad try such as Rhodesia. This is not just an\u00ad other election in a long series: It is an unprecedented event. Even assuming good will and the best intentions on the part of the Rhodesian regime the Rho\u00ad desians themselves hardly know what to expect. How can a group of self\u00ad anointed foreign observers do better? The possibilities for deception, misrepre\u00ad sentation, and simple mistake are rife in a situation where foreign observers of the kind contemplated in this resolution are 6560 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENA TE March 28, 1979 totally dependent on Rhodesian officials for transportation, security, and the op\u00ad portunity to watch elections in progress. I am not suggesting that the kind of newspaper reporting we are likely to get is going to provide better information than the proposed group of observers. What I am suggesting is that it is foolish to inject ourselves as a government in this situation in an effort to obtain in\u00ad formation that is bound to be question\u00ad able and of doubtful utility. I believe we should continue to impose sanctions against Rhodesia until there is genuine progress toward majority rule. That is an international obligation that we undertook to put pressure on the Smith regime to initiate steps toward this end. But, when it comes to forth\u00ad coming elections, there is little the United States can or should do to affect the outcome. Sending observers may give us information of marginal value, but at a cost of direct involvement that is not worth it. We should leave the Rhodesians to settle their own problems. Arguments have been made that send\u00ad ing an observer delegation gives an un\u00ad justified imprimatur to the Smith re\u00ad gime. It is also argued that security threats make the sending of a delegation imprudent. I am not persuaded by these arguments. If I thought sending observ\u00ad ers would give us reliable information on which to base sound policy with re\u00ad spect to Rhodesia, I would have no hesi\u00ad tation about supporting the resolution. But the weight of the evidence is on the other side. I do not believe that the pro\u00ad posed observer mission would serve the interests of the United States and will, therefore, not support the resolution. e Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President. Like everyone else in this chamber I am anxiou:.; to get on with the business of normalized relations with a free Zim\u00ad babwe. But I am not pursuaded that the Senate's approving monitors to super\u00ad vise the April elections can possibly hasten a political solution when the elections are structured in such a way as to exclude the opposition movement leaders from the process. It is my view that the \"internal settlement\" approach to the election negates the rationale behind unilateral involvement by the United States or any other nation of the world. How can one observe an election to determine its fairness when the process itself is inherently undemocratic? If there is to be a political solution, and we pray that this would be so rather than continued hostilities with violence from both sides, then there must be a just and comprehensive process. A United Nation's supervised election framework is what all parties, including those who have been excluded from the Smith plan, have requested. According to the Rhodesian Information Offi.ce this even in~ludes the Rhodesian Government Executive Council. But we must not give anyone in Rhodesia or the front-line nations any reason to believe that we as a nation want the Smith government to be bouyed for a long last-ditch stand. It appears abundantly clear that we must not take the side of either the Smith government or the opposition parties. Whether in reality or perception sending observors is taking a side. Our commitment to human rights and racial equality cannot be threatened at this time by such an ill-advised breach of U.N. procedure. o Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, last year the Congress passed the International Security Assistance Act which directed that sanctions against Zimbabwe Rhodesia be suspended upon a presi\u00ad dential determination that the present government there had made a good faith attempt to negotiate at an all-parties conference and that a freely elected government had been installed with the participation of all political and popu\u00ad lation groups. As you are aware, Mr. President, the interim government led by Mr. Ian Smith did agree to meet with all parties at a conference, however the Soviet-supplied, Marxist-dominated guerrilla groups known as the Patriotic Front declined to participate. RHODESIA MEETS PRECONDITIONS As a result the white minority gov\u00ad ernment moved ahead on its own in its plans for a transition to black majority rule. In January a new constitutional blueprint was ratified for the establish\u00ad ment of a new democratic government-\u00ad a government which for the first time would allow all population groups an opportunity to vote and hold offi.ce. This historic election will occur in less than 4 weeks, on April 20, 1979. It now ap\u00ad pears extremely likely that the new ERA ushered in on that date will meet the preconditions we in this body re\u00ad quired for the lifting of economic sanctions. A great many critics of the Ian Smith regime--and I too have many serious reservations about the legality, the mo\u00ad tivations and the actions of that govern\u00ad ment-quite a few critics have claimed that this new election will change nothing, and that the election itself is a sham. The Senator from Kansas is convinced however, that the white mi\u00ad nority in Rhodesia has at last seen the futility of its racist, bigoted programs. This transition to a full-participation, majority rule government is a meaning\u00ad ful charu?e. a real. first step of progress. These critics claim that because the new constitution still reserves 28 percent of the seats in parliament for the white minority we must reject the entire proc\u00ad ess of change. Mr. President, there are many countries we recognize today in Africa that are not known for their at\u00ad tention to democratic freedom, due process, and human rights. This by no means exculpates Rhodesia. But there is a ferment of change in detectable amounts in Rhodesia and South Africa of which we must work to take ad\u00ad vantage. BLACK SUPPORT FOR ELECTIONS The black moderates within Zimbabwe Rhodesia warmly embrace this compro\u00ad mise opportunity for a peaceful transi- tion. They do not want to see the massive white fiight that would come about if the Patriotic Front had its way. It would take decades to recover from the damage to the economy and technology such a fiight would cause. Instead they hope to see the orderly transition of power that accompanied the change from colonial status in Kenya. The administration, in the inflamed rhetoric of Andy Young, would deny any formula that does not include the Marx\u00ad ist terrorists. Why cannot we at least try to support a moderate, democratic and pro-western government on a con\u00ad tinent that is often hostile to our na\u00ad tional interests? Why should we insist that a violent, pro-Soviet guerrilla group-without suffi.cient internal sup\u00ad port to grasp power by legitimate means-be included in any settlement? The administration tells us that it is not reasonable to support an agreement that leaves out such a large and troublesome group as the Patriotic Front--that no solution would be viable while opposing armies remain in contention. This is the poll tical reasoning of ap\u00ad peasement and capitulation. We did not follow that course in the Middle Ea.st when we achieved the historic treaty be\u00ad tween Egypt and Israel-excluding the large and troublesome terrorist group called the Palestine Liberation Organiza\u00ad tion. The administration should have learned from that experience that it is not possible to compromise on every posi\u00ad tion, not when your opponent's stance calls for the complete rejection of your every right to existence. The Soviet Union, the last imperialist country on Earth, is involved in a giant pincer movement on the West, closing in on vital, strategic areas in the Mideast and the Horn of Africa. Russia has many 'untapped natural resources, but they would like to get control over the oil in the Arabian States and the raw materials in Africa indispensable to the machinery of American defense. Western Europe, perceiving a pattern of American with\u00ad drawal and retreat throughout the world, will be forced into an accommodation with the U.S.S.R. if they see their vital .sources of supply coming under the sway of pro-Soviet governments. The \"Fin\u00ad landization\" of Europe would leave the United States in a vulnerable and dan\u00ad gerous position, standing virtually alone against an aggressive enemy. We must encourage the moderate gov\u00ad ernments of Africa. We must give every opportunity for the new government in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia to succeed. Our em\u00ad bargos and sanctions serve only to drive the white minority into a circle of covere(l wagons. Our constructive involvement can improve the conditions for success or failure for this desperate la.st chance experiment. I urge the lifting of sanctions concomi\u00ad t-:tnt with the scheduled elections. I also would hope that the United States would show a greater willingness to work for progress and democracy with those truly representative, legitimate parties who are pro-Western. The Egyptian-Israeli agreement gave us the lesson that we c\"a.nnot remain aloof from those crises that threaten global strategic interests. We must commit ourselves to involve\u00ad ment. Mr. President I would just like to add that utilizing white minority representa\u00ad tion to enhance the smooth transition to March ~8, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENA TE 6561 a majority rule government has ample precedent among some of Rhodesia's strongest critics. In Tanzania, Kenya, and Zambia provision was made to avoid economic and technological disaster by allowing disproportionate minority par\u00ad ticipation in the postcolonial govern\u00ad ments. I ask that this information sheet on such previous examples be printed in the RECORD. The material follows: MINORITY REPRESENTATION IN PosTCOLONIAL CONS'1Trt1TIONS OF TANZANIA, KENYA, AND ZAMBIA TANZANIA The 1958 constttut!on Legislative Council of 30 members-one African, one Aslan and one European from each of ten constituencies. IPOpUl&tion: African ------------------------ 8, 600, 000 Asian ------------------------ 70 000 European -------------------- 20,000 Nyerere's TANU contested the elections on this basis and won ten African seats, seven As1an seats and four European seats. The 1960 consUtut!on Parliament of 71 member~50 open seat.e, eleven Asian and ten European. I.e. 30 % of the sea.ts were reserved for minority groups which together represented one per cent of the populaition. KENYA The 1960 const!tut!on Legislative Council of 65 member&-45 open, 10 Europeans, 8 Asian and 2 Arab. Population: African ------------------------ 6, 000, ooo European ---------------------- 62,000 Asian-------------------------- 161,000 C>thers ------------------------- 40,000 Thus 30% of the seats in the legislation went to minority groups t.otalling 4% of the population. ZAMBIA The 1962 constitut!on A complex arra-ngement of dua~ voting rolls which in effect gave 15 seats to 84,000 Euro\u00ad peans and 15 seats to 3.5 milllon A!ricans.e Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, when the resolution sponsored by Senators Mc\u00ad GoVERN and HAYAKAWA was before the Foreign Relations Committee, I felt com\u00ad pelled to vote against it. Although I be\u00ad lieve that the resolution is well inten\u00ad tioned, I have serious doubts about whether the plan could really be imple\u00ad mented as envisioned by the sponsors. The resolution calls for impartial ob\u00ad servers. My concern is that if a person is sufficiently knowledgeable about the in\u00ad ternal government and the events lead\u00ad ing up to these elections, it is hard to be\u00ad lieve that such a person could also be truly impartial. Moreover, it is my feeling that a team of 25 to 50 observers will not be able to cover the entire country adequately to obtain all the information they will need for their report. Under the best of cir\u00ad cumstances, this is a difficult challenge. Our observers will be dependent on the Rhodesian Government not only for ac\u00ad cess to places and people, but for secu\u00ad rity, at a time when 90 percent of the country is under martial law. An inter\u00ad national law professor who testified be\u00ad fore the committee said that because of conditions in Rhodesia, he had \"very real questions concerning the feasibility, in- CXXV--413-Pa.rt 5 deed, the wisdom, of conducting the elec\u00b7 tions on April\u00b7 20.,, Finally, we' really have no as~urances that the composition of the team wUI actually ?Ileet the criteria set forth in the resolution. Beyopd the two cochair\u00ad ?Ilen, Congress has no control over the team membership. If th~ 'team chosen is perceived not to be impartial, or \"bal\u00ad anced,\" or is not well qualified, we are taking a great risk in sending them. Regrettably, it appears to me that the odds are against the observer team's being able to accomplish well what the sponsors would like them to do. And if they fall short of the challenge, either through their own shortcomings or be\u00ad cause of the many difficulties they will encounter in Rhodesia, and they produce an insufficient or inaccurate report, this effort will have proven to be dangerously counterproductive. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back? Mr. HAYAKAWA. I yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution, as amended.

ORDER OF BUSINESS The PRESIDING OFFICER. May we have order in the Chamber? The Senator from West Virginia has the floor, but may we have order? The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, under the agreement reached earlier to\u00ad day, Mr. MORGAN and Mr. WEICKER were to be recognized at the conclusion of all other legislative business to call up their resolution on which a time agreement has been reached. I would inquire of both distinguished Senators as to whether or not they ex\u00ad pect a rollcall vote on this resolution. Perhaps I should ask Mr. MORGAN to state to the Senate what the resolution does and then I would inquire as to whether' or not anyone wants a rollcall vote. \u00b7 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend for just a moment, so we could have order in the Chamber? The Chair is having dimculty hearing and I suspect others are having that diffi\u00ad culty, too. The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I yield to the Senator. REVIEW OF RULE XLII AND SENATE RESOLUTION 109 Mr. MORGAN. Mr. President, in 1977, the Sena:te adopted rule XLII, which is the ethics rule under which we operate. Last year we passed the law, ethics and conduct in government, the bill of 1978, which provides for ethics in the judici\u00ad ary, executive, and legislative branches. I had proposed that we conform our rule to the law that we passed last year as the House did. But this morning we decided we would ref er that t.o the Ethics Committee, along with Senator WEICKER's proposed resolution which he introduced last week, with instructions that they make a study of the differences between them and report back to the Senate in 30 days. After consulting with Rules and Governmental Affairs, we have the agreement of the chairman of the Rules Committee and the chairman of Governmental Affairs, and, as far as I know, there is no controversy. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. So the resolu\u00ad tion provides only for a study and then a reporting back within 30 days? Mr. MORGAN. Yes. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Does any Sen\u00ad ator wish to have a rollcall vote on that resolution? Mr. WEICKER addressed the Chair. Mr. ROBERT c. BYRD. I yield to the Senator from Connecticut. Mr. WEICKER. Mr. President, my re\u00ad sponse to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia is that I do not intend to ask for a rollcall vote unless we get into some sort of parliamentary hassle here as between committees, and then the answer is \"yes,\" I will force the issue to a vote. I imagine from the comments of the distinguished Senator from North Caro\u00ad lina that such is not the case, that all three committees have agreed to partici\u00ad pate, and what it is is called for by his resolution. If that is the case, I have no difficulty at all in having this matter passed by a voice vote. But I want that assurance, because I do not want to mislead my col\u00ad leagues. If we get into some sort of par\u00ad liamentary battle or turf battle as to ju\u00ad risdiction, that is a horse of a different color. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator if he 1s agreeable to putting such a rollcall vote over until tomorrow, if it 1s asked for. Mr. WEICKER. Yes, I do agree to that. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I thank all Senators. Mr. President, I ask that the Senator be recognized now to call up his resolu\u00ad tion. Mr. McCLURE. Mr. President, wlll the Senator yield for a question? Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I yield. Mr. McCLURE. The House has passed a resolution with regard to Taiwan, and the papers are being brought back here. Is it the intention of the leader to bring that conference report before the body today? Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. CHURCH, who is the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, spoke to me earlier. He indicated a desire to bring it up to\u00ad morrow, and I told him that lt is a privileged matter and that he could call it up about noon. Mr. McCLURE. It would not be the majority leader's intention to bring it up today? Mr. ROBERT c. BYRD. It would not be. Mr. McCLURE. I thank the Senator. Mr. ROBERT c. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from Connecticut and the distinguished Sen\u00ad ator from North Carolina if they would be agreeable to Mr. SASSER's calling up a resolution, with a time limitation of no more than 10 minutes thereon, to allow him to dispose of that before we get into their issue. There will be more talk on theirs. It is entirely up to them. Mr. WEICKER. Mr. President, reserv\u00ad ing the right to object, I think the Sen\u00ad ator from North Carolina and I have given way to everybody else. Mr. ROBERT c. BYRD. The Senators have been very patient. Mr. WEICKER. We have tried to work it out. If this were a unanimous-consent request for a minute, it would be dif\u00ad ferent, but 10 minutes 1s of some sub\u00ad stance. I would like to move forward with what has been scheduled. Mr. ROBERT c. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the disposition of the pending resolution that is being called up by Mr. MORGAN, the distinguished Senator from Tennessee <Mr. SASSER) be recognized to call up his resolution. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. SENATE RESOLUTION 117-REVIEW OF RULE XLII OF THE STANDING RULES AND SENATE RESOLUTION 109 Mr. MORGAN. Mr. President, I ask that my resolution be reported. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The reso\u00ad lution will be stated. The legislative clerk read as follows: A resolution (S. Res. 117) directing a re\u00ad view of Rule XLII of the Standdng Rules of the Senate and S. Res. 109. The Senate proceeded to coll$ider the resolution. Mr. MORGAN . Mr. President, I will take only about 5 minutes, but I think it is important that I state for the record\u00ad especially for statf members who are lis\u00ad tening in their offices-what my resolu\u00ad tion proposes to. do' and what we hope to do after the report. It will be recalled, as I mentioned ear-March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 6563 lier, that in 1977, if my recollec~ion is correct, we adopted new rule XLII for the Senate, which had to do with the ethics under which we now live in the Senate. It dealt with public disclosure and a number of other subjects. Then, throughout 1977 and in 1978, the Governmental Affairs Committee worked o.n a bill called Ethics in Oov\u00ad ernment Act of 1978. It finally was passed last year in the House and in the Senate, and it is the law of the land. It prescribes a code of ethics, a code of conduct, not only for Congress but for the judiciary, including the Supreme Court of the Unit\u00ad ed States, and the executive branch as well. It is substantially the same as rule XLll, which we are trying to administer under my distinguished chairman, the Senator from Illinois, in the Ethics Com\u00ad mittee. There are some differences, and I think these should be known to the Members of the Senate. I will mention them in a moment. However, a!ter the Ethics in Govern\u00ad ment Act of 1978 was passed last year, the House of Representatives, in January, changed its rules to coincide or to mesh with the new law. Similar action by the committee would make both Houses of Congress consistent. I thi.nk it would give greater clarity to the rules and greater certainty to the American people in their understanding of Congress. In my opinion, there is no reason why Members of Congress should live under rule.s different from those under which members of the Supreme Court or Cabi\u00ad net members live. It would make a couple of changes. I believe that the Ethics in Government Act would produce a more balanced ap\u00ad proach to financial disclosure. By setting higher cutoff levels for reporting, espe\u00ad cially for staff members, there would be a reduction in the number of 1.ndl\u00ad vlduals who would be required to file. In addition, the workload of the re\u00ad sponsible committees would be decreased and the efficiency of oversight would in\u00ad crease. Right now, there are approxi\u00ad mately 1,600 staff members in the Sen\u00ad ate who are required to file. It is an un\u00ad workable figure and one that cannot be managed. The cutoff levels in the act would be higher, and we would not have as many, but we would have the top echelon, and therefore we could do a better job policing them. The random audits within each term of a Senator would be eliminated. Under the present law, every Senator has to have his disclosure statement audited by the General Accounting Office at least once during the term. Under their ran\u00ad dom selection method, some Senators can be audited three times. Those who have been audited know what a burdensome process this is. Disclosure would be required of travel expenses, something that is not now re\u00ad quired under our rule. It ls required un\u00ad der the law, but it is not required under our rule. Reporting on certain private matters, such as home mortgages or furniture or c\u00b7ars would be eliminated, and liabilities over $10,000, rather than $2,500, would be disclosed. In essence, Mr. President, the law would be clearer. One law would apply to all officials in Government. What we propose to do, what this reso\u00ad lution provides, is to ask the Ethics Com\u00ad mittee to make a comparison of rule XLII with the law, along with the resolu\u00ad tion which previously has ~en offered by the distinguished Senator frorri Connec\u00ad ticut, and report back to the Senate with\u00ad in 30 days with recommendations. I think time is of the essence because the new financial disclosure must be filed by May 15. So I think it should be done quickly. I am glad to yield some of my time to my distinguished chairman. Mr. STEVENSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Carolina for yielding. I do have a question to ask him. I commend him and the Senator from Connecticut for offering this resolution. The appropriate committee of the Sen\u00ad ate should consider conforming rule XLII with the Ethics In Government Act, and it should give consideration to Sen\u00ad ate Resolution 109, which was submitted by the Senator from Connecticut. This resolution would require the Ethics Committee to consider these mat\u00ad ters and, as I understand it, if it con\u00ad cludes that rule changes would be appropriate, to report rule changes to the Senate. The only committee with jurisdiction to do that is the Rules Committee; so my question to my colleagues is whether this resolution has been cleared with the Rules Committee. As I understand it, the resolution would mandate the Ethics Committee to report rule changes. Mr. MORGAN. It has been cleared with the chairman of the Rules Com\u00ad mittee and the chairman of the Gov\u00ad ernment Affairs Committee. I personally cleared it with the chairman of the Gov\u00ad ernment Affairs Committee, and the majority staff cleared it with the chair\u00ad man of the Rules Committee. The majority leader, who is on the Rules Committee, has stated that he has no objection. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator from North Carolina yield? Mr. MORGAN. I yield. Mr. ROBERT c. BYRD. I do not read the resolution as requiring the Ethics Committee to report legislation. Mr. MORGAN. Just recommendations. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. The distin\u00ad guished Senator from Illinois is correct. Legislation could not be reported by the Ethics Committee. I think that is what he said, did he not? Mr. STEVENSON. Mr. President, no. As I read this resolution it would re\u00ad quire the Ethics Committee to report rule changes in order to conform Senate rules with law and rule changes are within the jurisdiction of the Rules Committee. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. The way I read the resolution it would require only that the committee report on the re\u00ad sults of its review together with its recommendations. It would not be re\u00ad porting legislation. Am I correct, may I ask the distinguished Senator from North Carolina? Mr. MORGAN. Mr. President, that was our intention. It really was our intention to give the Senate the benefit o! the committee's study and thoughts on the two matters. Mr. STEVENSON. Then, if I under\u00ad stand the Senators, it would not be in\u00ad cumbent on the Ethics Committee to re\u00ad port rule changes. It would simply make a report and with the benefit of that re\u00ad port the appropriate committees, in\u00ad cluding the Rules Committee of the Senate, could recommend rule changes to the Senate. And as I understand it, also, it does not require the Ethics Com\u00ad mittee to report any specific action with respect to rule XLII or Senate Resolu\u00ad tion 109. Mr. MORGAN. That is my under\u00ad standing. Mr. STEVENSON. With that, Mr. President, I have no objections to this resolution. Indeed, I will support it and do my best to see to it that the Ethics committee considers this mandate promptly and within the time limit spe\u00ad cified by the resolution. I thank my colleague for his assur\u00ad anoes. Mr. WEICKER. Mr. President, while the distinguished Senator from Illinois is on the floor, I ask a question not in the sense in any way, I might add, of embar\u00ad rassing him but trying to make the point in the sense of what follows. If I am not mistaken, if I recall the final moments of debate on the ethics code, indeed after debate was over and the vote was taken, did not the late distinguished Senator from Minnesota, Senator Humphrey, ask that a summary or a synopsis of what it was that had been passed be put t.ogether by the Ethics Committee and distributed to various Senators? Mr. STEVENSON. I think the Senator is correct, and the Ethics Committee is going way beyond the suggestion of the late Senator from Minnesota. As the Sen\u00ad ator from Connecticut, I am sure, realizes all Senators have already been furnished with the first of two large looseleaf note\u00ad books which will contain not only a sum\u00ad mary, but all of the rulings of the com\u00ad mittee annotated and not only the code but the other provisions of law and of the rules which this committee has to enforce. I regret that we have not been able to get all of this done sooner, but it has been a moving target. The rules have changed; laws have been enacted. We have had to also prepare to file first the elaborate dis\u00ad closure forms for last year and then new provisions came into effect and we had to \u00b7 prepare additional financial disclos1!1'e forms for this year which have been cir\u00ad culated. And as of today I think the total number of interpretive rulings issued by this committee is in excess of 700. So the commi\u00b7ttee has been busy, and I do hope that we will be able to comply fully with the late Senator's request and go beyond that soon. But this experience just under\u00ad scores what an extremely elaborate and difficult code it is we have adopted for ourselves in its enforcement. Mr. WEICKER. I asked the question, 6564 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE March 28, 1979 Mr. President, not in any way to refiect negatively on the diligence of the com\u00ad mittee which, Lord knows, has been dili\u00ad gent but to underline, rather, the im\u00ad passibility of what it was that was created out here on the fioor in a heated quest for instant ethics. Here it is a task that what was a simple request, I might add, becomes a little bit ludicrous when one understands that the request was made for the synopsis or the summary after we had voted. And even that what seemingly is a simple request, and indeed it is not in light of what it is that was passed, 2 years later has not been able to fully accomplished-and not due in any way to the members of the committee or the staff of the committee. They have been diligent, but it is the impossibility of the task due to the im\u00ad possibility of the legislation. The prob\u00ad lem was not the honorarium situation as we addressed. it here this afternoon. Sure, that grabs the headlines and that 1S something that is easily editorialized, easily understood, easily demagoged, but what is at issue here is an ethics code which is enforceable, and the present code and the present law is not and therefore, is worse than nothing at all. Mr. President, this resolution includes an evaluation of Senate Resolution 109. This is a comprehensive substitute, for the Senate ethics code. It tries to deliver what is expected of us in the sense of a code or a code of conduct that is enforci\u00ad ble. It is easily understood, but the es\u00ad sence of all of this is very simply this: What is proper or improper is something to be determined by the constituencies of the respective Senators on this fioor and is not something to be framed in the terms of the opinions of the seven mem\u00ad bers of the Ethics Committee. This comprehensive ethics reform re\u00ad spands to the frustrating and debilitat\u00ad ing experience of the Senate in the last 2 years under the present Code of Official Conduct. This complex, arbitrary and incomprehensible system has yielded neither higher ethical standards nor public respect for this institution. The proposals I have submitted in Senate Resolution 109 will make ethics a credi\u00ad ble, meaningful, and understandable exercise for both the membership of this body and the people we represent. I care not a whit for the public re\u00ad lations of ethics. The public relations has nothing to do with what is supposed supposed to be passed on this fioor. What I care about is a code that can be under\u00ad stood and that can be enforced and that will further the credibility of this insti\u00ad tution. Senate Resolution 109 has two broad purposes: First, to rebuild the Official Code of Conduct to establish full finan\u00ad cial disclosure as the foundation of Sen\u00ad ate ethics; and second, to restructure the administrative and investigative func\u00ad tions of the ethics jurisdiction in the Senate. Two years ago this Senate found it necessary to demonstrate its rectitude to a skeptical public. It did so under the Damoclean sword of an unPopular pay raise, recommended not by Congress but by a Presidential commission. The Of\u00ad ficial Code of Conduct under which we now live was the product of haste and expediency. The time has come, Mr. President, to take a look at what we pas~ed oq April Fools Day 1977 and understand tnat the cruel joke was on us and on those we serve. Senate Resolu'tipn 110 was intended to provide a comprehensive system to moni\u00ad tor ethical behavior of Senators and staff. What we got was partial disclosure and restrictions on otherwise legal activ\u00ad ities. A so-called Code of Ethics was patched together on and off this fioor during 10 days of debate. In approv\u00ad ing Senate Resolution 110, Senators agreed that our ethical obligation has been satisfied and that the public rela\u00ad tions of this body had been well served. The price we have paid for that quick fix of respectability has been enormous. In this Senator's opinion we have blackened our eyes to save face. It is time we got down to the real issues of ethics and left the cosmetics to lesser men and women than ourselves. Full financial disclosure must be rec\u00ad ognized as the force and essence of ethics\u00b7 regulation in the Senate. We must fash\u00ad ion a Code of Ethics which provides the media, the voters and political opponents with every significant fact which bears on the conscientious performance of of\u00ad ficial duties of an incumbent or candi\u00ad date. Compelling each member, candi\u00ad date and key staff member to reveal to public scrutiny a complete history of fi\u00ad nancial dealings is the most credible and legitimate role we can play. Now, there are those who, for one reason or another, continue to try to impose either in the form of law or an. amendment or proposition words which substitute for the judgment of either men in this body or the constituency as a whole, and I suggest to my colleagues that the system works as long as it is in possession of all facts. There is no better ethics committee than the people of this country when given all material facts. No individual judgment of either the Senator from North Carolina <Mr. Moa\u00ad GAN) or the Senator from Connecticut, sitting on an Ethics Committee, can substitute for the judgments of their con\u00ad stituencies, given all the tacts. The present code rests on two danger\u00ad ous presumptions that: First, we are an inherently dishonest and corruptible lot, and second, that the Senate must step in where the electorate has failed to en\u00ad foree proper conduct. We cannot legis\u00ad late respect for this body, Mr. President. We must earn it. We cannot do so by stepping on the franchise of the Ameri\u00ad can voter. We will not do so through a system of partial disclosure which leaves the public more confused than enlight\u00ad ened. We cannot do so by telling the Nation through our Code of Ethics that 100 grown Senators need a nanny of an ethics panel to keep us in llne. Mr. President, the opportunity to serve in the U.S. Senate gives this Senator great pride. To participate in one of the noblest government institutions in his\u00ad tory is both a high honor and a solemn respansibUity. But I am ashamed, Mr. President, of this Senate when we en\u00ad gage in an exercise of the rank of this so-called Code of Official Conduct. In it we barter the substance of congressional ethics for its appearance. In it we trade our accountability as representatives for a fiimsy guise of regulated propriety. In it we degrade ourselves, our constitu\u00ad tional system, and our constituents. For the last 2 years, the Senate Select Committee on Ethics has labored to bend reality into the shapes dictated by Sen\u00ad ate Resolution 110. Almost 200 interpre\u00ad tative rulings have been handed down by the select committee to explain to Senators what it was they passed, and in some important issues, the select com\u00ad mittee has been unable to provide any meaningful guidelines. As a former member of that commit\u00ad tee I can personally attest to the fact that its deliberations resemble some\u00ad thing out of Dante's Inferno. Such weighty issues as: may two Senate em\u00ad ployees who wed accept a gift of shrimp for their reception from a State official? And what meaning can be put into meaningless terms and restrictions on confiict of interest, divestiture and gifts. If further evidence of the f allure of this particular experiment in congressional ethics is needed, note the stampede of members to get off the select committees in the House and Senate. \u00b7 Mr. President, we need an ethics code worthy of this great body and the re\u00ad sponsible, intelligent, decent citizens who sent us here. Therefore, I have intro\u00ad duced ethics reform legislation which is designed to streamline and strengthen the Senate ethics system. I invite my .colleagues to examine carefully the specific provisions of this legislative package. I welcome comment and criti\u00ad cism, and would be pleased to discuss modifications to improve these proposals. But what is most important is that the Senate, after 2 years of experience with Senate Resolution 110, reconsider what it is we really mean by ethics in govern\u00ad ment. In summary, Senate Resolution 109 th'e Official Conduct Amendments o1 1979 would substitute a new rule XLll which requires full disclosure of assets, liabilities, gifts, and honoraria received, and positions held by persons covered by the rule, as well as disclosure of tax returns-except for itemized medical deductions or charitable contributions. Because full disclosure should be the essence of ethics in the Senate, rule XLIII, restrictions on gifts and foreign travel and rule XLIV, restrictions on outside earned income and honoraria are repealed-however, existing statu\u00ad tory restrictions, on foreign travel and honoraria, for example, are not affected. Rule XLV-conflict of interest-is amended to permit outside business or professional activity which is not incon\u00ad sistent or in conflict with performance of official duties. Rule XLVI-unofJlcial office accounts-is amended to include the language of Senate Resolution 25 which was reported earlier this year by the Select Committee on Ethics. Rules March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 6565 XLVIl throUgh L are retained without amendment. The resolution further restructures the ethics jurisdiction of the Senate by sep\u00ad arating the administrative and investi\u00ad gative functions of ethics regulation. The Select Committee on Ethics will have the sole responsibility of invest~..; gating complaints of improper miscon\u00ad duct which have been referred to it by the Committee on Rules, which will have the responsibility of administering the disclosure and other provisions of the code. However, since the rules to be ad\u00ad ministered have been simplified in num\u00ad ber and complexity, and since the num\u00ad ber of persons covered by the disclosure and other rules has been reduced by more than half, the administrative bur\u00ad den on the Rules Committee will be sub\u00ad stantially less than that of the Ethics Committee. The third part of the ethics reform package, contained in S. 694 legislation amending the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, would provide that the require\u00ad ments for disclosure under title I of that act as to Senators and certain Sen\u00ad ate employees, would be satisfied by :fil\u00ad ing under rule XLII of the Standing Rules of the Senate. Thus, the require\u00ad ment for two different :filings for cer\u00ad tain persons covered by the act and the rules would be eliminated without lessen\u00ad ing and in fact through strengthening of the disclosure requirement. Our recent experience on this floor with Senate Resolution 93 indicates both the need for responsible ethics reform and broad Senate support for it. On March 8, 1979, the Senate approved a 4-year postponement of rule 44, limita\u00ad tion on outside income. The logic of this specific re~olution, which I supported, applies generally to the initiative I have offered: that financial disclosure is the best enforcer of ethics and that restric\u00ad tions of otherwise legal activities create more problems than they solve. Mr. President, I am hopeful that the Senate will afford these proposals se\u00ad rious consideration. I realize ethics is a controversial subject that many in this Chamber would rather not bring up ever again. However, I strongly believe that we owe it to our constituents and to ourselves to assure that the Senate un\u00ad derstands what ethics is all about, and what makes it work. Public integrity is not assured by arbitrary restraints on personal activity-it is achieved when a fully informed public is in a position to render judgment on its elected rep\u00ad resentatives. Full disclosure is the foun\u00ad participatory democracy. It is time now dation of ethical responsibility in our for the Senate to live up to this simple yet supremely eff ectiive principle of ethics regulation. Mr. President, I hope that the Senate Ethics Committee, in consultation with the Rules Committee and the Govern\u00ad mental Affairs Committee, will see to it that meaningful evaluation is brought forth to the Senate floor 30 days hence, and that at that time the leadership will so schedule the matter that whatever is in place come July 1 will be effective. I am tired, and I might add, not naive in the sense of not being associated with politics, too, of at times hearing that \"the Senator from Connecticut is, well, you know, he is naive, he is idealistic.'' Oh, no.. Six years in the statehouse in Hart! ord, 4 years elected mayor of a town, 2 years in the House, 9 years in the Senate, and\u00b7I have seen government in all of its aspects. Those who say that the rule of the game is corruption. ineptness, self\u00ad aggrandizement do not know what they are talking about. The rule among 98 percent is a dedication, an integrity, un\u00ad paralleled in any other profession in this country. If it is not so I also have a great belief in the present election process and in the intelligence of the American voters. I would far rather that that intelligence and that evaluation be exercised by them than be exercised by a small group of in\u00ad dividuals, be they Senators or be they staff, and who hold in their hands the fate of any Member of this body or any member of the staff supporting this body. Commonsense is all I want. Common\u00ad sense in the way of ethics legislation, and then the judgment of the American people. There is no argument to me that only 34 percent of the American people choose to exercise that judgment on election day. It is their responsibility both to see to the substance of what it is in the na\u00ad ture of our national priorities, it is their responsibility to see what it is that will be the ethics of those they send to serve. That is the system, and that is a system that will work, and one which I hope we will adopt. I yield at this time unless there are others who care to speak-I yield the remainder of my time. - Mr. MORGAN. Mr. President, I yield back all the time that I have unless someone else desires the time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Connecticut yield back his time? Mr. WEICKER. I yield back the re\u00ad mainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques\u00ad tion is on agreeing to the resolution. The resolution CS. Res. 117) was agreed to as follows: Be&oZved, that the select committee on Ethics shall review the deslrablllty of re\u00ad peallng in part or modifying Rule XLII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, and review the provisions of S. Res. 109, and, after consul\u00ad tation with the Committee on Governmen\u00ad tal A1falrs and the Committee on Rules and Administration, shall report on the results of its review, together with its recommenda\u00ad tions, to the Senate within thirty (30) days after the day on which this resolution 1B agreed to. Mr. WEICKER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the resolution was agreed to. Mr. MORGAN. I move to lay that mo\u00ad tion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. RETIREMENT OF JOEL W. SOLOMON AS ADMINISTRATOR OF THE GEN\u00ad ERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION Mr. SASSER. Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk and ask unanimous consent for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The reso\u00ad lution will be stated by title. The legislative clerk read as follows: A resolution (S. Res. 118) noting the re\u00ad tirement of Joel W. Solomon, and express\u00ad ing gratitude for his contributions as a publlc servant. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the further reading of the resolution will be dispensed with and the Senate will proceed to its immediate con\u00ad sideration. The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution CS. Res. 118) which was sub\u00ad mitted by Mr. SASSER, for himself, Mr. R!BICOFF, Mr. BAKER, Mr. METZENBAU:M, Mr. EAGLETON, Mr. PELL, Mr. MOYNIHAN, Mr. CHILES, Mr. ZORINSKY, Mr. PRYOR, Mr. RoBERT C. BYRD, JR., Mr. RANDOLPH, Mr. BoREN, Mr. DuRKIN, Mr. LEVIN, Mr. BENTSEN, Mr. MATSUNAGA, Mr. SARBANES, Mr. STEVENS, Mr. NUNN and Mr. PERCY. Mr. SASSER. Mr. President, this res\u00ad olution has been cleared with the ma\u00ad jority and minority leaders. It is with great pleasure that I ofter this resolution to honor Joel W. SOio\u00ad mon. Jay SOiomon has servecl as Adminis\u00ad trator of the General Services Admin\u00ad istration for 2 years. He will leave omce on Saturday to return to private life. While there has been discussion about the circumstances of Jay's departure from the GSA, there has been vast and bipartisan praise for the accomplish\u00ad ments of his administratorship. The GSA employs over 37,000 men and women. It is the Government's landlord, its purchasing agent, its travel agent, its archivist, and much more. Jay has performed well in each of these areas. But, Jay will be and has already been noted for other reasons. Jay Solomon brought considerable talents to his Government position. Talents which have brought him abun\u00ad dant personal rewards are talents he shared with the country. What has proven to be most important about his service to the GSA is not only his keen business and management abllitles-but even more, his very clear sense of what is right and what is wrong. He saw waste. He saw fraud and he saw corruption. And, he knew there was only one course to take: The very dif\u00ad ficult course of correcting these wrongs. He could have turned his head or closed his eyes. But, he did not. He did not temporize. He did not blink when he faced the crisis at GSA. He spoke up. He told the American people what he saw. And, he acted. He did what had to be done. He attacked the problem. And, he produced results. The saga of Jay Solomon in Wash\u00ad ington reminds me of the words of Ed\u00ad mund Burke, who said: All that ls necessary for the triumph of evil ls that good men do nothing. 6566 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE MQ,rch 28, 1979 Jay Solomon is a good man. He is an honest man. He is capable of outrage and he is capable of action. He acted. His outrage at what he found at GSA was matched by the effectiveness of his actions. Jay Solomon was not able to eliminate all of the GSA's problems in his 2 years as Administrator but, he started the process. He exposed a great deal of wrongdoing, and some of those who vio\u00ad lated the public trust have been pub\u00ad lished. Most important he gave the people of the United States renewed confidence\u00ad confldence that those who violate their obligations as servants of the public will not go unchallenged. He demonstrated that the Government can operate in the light of day. He had no fear of dealing with the problems of his agency in the open and with no equivocation or dissembling. President Kennedy once observed: For those to whom much ls given, much ls required. And when the high court of history sits in judgment, recording whether in our brief span of service we fulfilled our responsib111t1es to the sta.te, our success or fallure, in whatever officP., wm be judged by the answers to four questions: First, were we truly men of courage. Second, were we truly men o! judgment. Third, were we truly men ot integrity. Finally, were we truly men ot dedication. Mr. President, by these basic criteria, I believe that Jay Solomon w111 be judged well. He w111 be remembered in Washington as a good man who had the courage to act. I am honored to present this resolution to the Senate. Mr. President, I yield to the distin\u00ad guished minority leader. Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Clerk wm call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk pro\u00ad ceeded to call the roll. Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, it is my privilege to be a cosponsor, with my dis\u00ad tinguished colleague <Mr. SASSER), of the resolution now pending before the Sen\u00ad ate. It was may privilege as well to speak earlier, in the course of the time allo\u00ad cated to the leadership under the stand\u00ad ing order this morning, on the subject of Mr. Solomon's retirement. I wlll not, therefore, speak redundantly on this subject, except to say that not only do I admire Jay Solomon for his work, his dedication, and his devotion to service, but for his diligence as well. I wish to him and to his wife and their family rewarding and satisfying continu\u00ad ation of their distinguished careers in Tennessee, and I join with Senator SAS\u00ad SER in the hope that the Senate will promptly adopt this resolution. Mr. EAGLETON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join our colleague, the Sena\u00ad tor from Tennessee, in sponsoring a reso\u00ad lution to recognize the achievements of Jay Solomon, the outgoing Administra\u00ad tor of the General Services Admin- istration. \u00b7 Mr. Solomon~s most newsworthy achievement at. GSA has, I of course, been his spearheadiilg of the iiivestigation of corruptf6h and scandals \u00b7 wii:tiin the agency. However, Jay Solomon has not spent all of his time ferreting out evil\u00ad doers. He also has found time to be a progressive and creative administrator. Projects in my own State of Missouri bear witness to this. In St. Louis, we faced a problem With our old Post Office building. Several years ago, this building was deserted, decaying and slated for destruction. It's loss would have been a historical tragedy, as it is one of only two remaining buildings de\u00ad signed by the noted 19th century archi\u00ad tect, Alfred Mullett. Today, the Old Post Office is under\u00ad going rehabilitation. In accordance with the administration's policy of using Fed\u00ad eral facilities as levers and magnets for core city redevelopment, GSA under Jay Solomon worked with local preserva\u00ad tionists to save the building. It now is to be the first Federal building rehabili\u00ad tated under the Federal Buildings Co\u00ad operative Use Act. When completed, this historically significant structure will live again, providing needed Federal office space and downtown shopping, as well. The Old Post Office project is a signifi\u00ad cant Federal contribution to the con\u00ad tinuing revitalization of downtown St. Louis. In Kansas City, we faced a not totally dissimllar project with the Kansas City Union Station. All local efforts to save that beautiful and historic structure had failed when GSA, working in conjunc\u00ad tion with my office and with Kansas City Mayor Charles Wheeler, got into the act. Under our plan, which now is under final review at GSA, the Federal Government will take over the building and much of the surrounding land for use as dffices and a museum. A new Internal Revenue Service center building will be erected on adjacent land, and an area of the central city which we once thought doomed to blight will be rejuvenated. The Union Station project, which we hope soon will be a reality, was a complex and difficult project to arrange. We Will owe its success in large measure to the en\u00ad couragement. cooperation and strong support of Jay Solomon at GSA. These are Just two of the many exam\u00ad ples I could cite from around the coun\u00ad try, examples of the way Jay Solomon has directed GSA as a positive force for the improvement of life in our urban areas. It is the kind of aggressive and creative management we should encour\u00ad age in the Federal Government. Along with the citizens of Missouri, I am grate\u00ad ful to Jay Solomon for his efforts in this regard, and I am pleased to be able to .ioin in paying him a tribute. Mr. METZENBAUM. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Tennessee for the action he is taking today to recog\u00ad nize the outstanding service that .Jay Solomon has given to this Nation as ad\u00ad ministrator of the GSA. I deeply regret Mr. Solomon's departure and I want him to ~OV!-tqat there are very many people in this country who are grateful for what he tried to do against overwhelm\u00ad ing odds to restore integrity to a de\u00ad servedly discredited agency. Two years ago, Jay Solomon took on a job that would have made a lesser man throw up his hands in frustration and dismay. Two years ago, Jay Solomon stepped into an agency that was riddled from top to bottom with every kind of abuse and corruption. And in those 2 years, he launched a cleanup process that cannot and will not be reversed. I am sorry that Jay Solomon will not be able to finish what he started. I aim sorry to see a man of his quality leave this administration. And I am especially sorry that the circumstances of his departure are such that they will inevitably give pause to other men of courage, competence, and integrity who may in the future be called upon to enter the service of our Govern\u00ad ment. Mr. President, Jay Solomon is one of the finest public servants that ti has ever been my pleasure to know. Jay Solomon is the kind of man that this Government cannot afford to lose. And as he returns to private life, I want to offer to him and to his loveiy and talented wife, Rosalind, my wannest good wishes and my deep appreciation for a Job well and faithfully done. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution. The resolution <S. Res. 118) was agreed to. The preamble was agreed to. The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows: Whereas Joel W. Solomon has provided outstanding and exemplary government serv\u00ad ice !or two years as Administrator o! the General Services Administration; Whereas he left a successful and lucrative business career to serve his country; Whereas he has worked to rid the General Services Administration o! widespread fraud, corruption, and mismanagement; Whereas he has renewed publtc con11dence 1n the reallty o! an open, efficient, and est government; Whereas, through his commitment to his\u00ad toric preservation and the promotion o! the arts, he has added a human perspective to public administration; and Whereas his leadership has been an inspi\u00ad ration to those who belteve that one man in government can make a dllrerence: Now, therefore, be it Besolve4, That, at this time of his retire\u00ad ment from his position as Administrator of the General Services Administration, the Senate o! the United States honors Joel w. Solomon and expresses gratitude !or h:la tireless and seltless contributions to the Na\u00ad tion. ROUTINE MORNING BUSINESS Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD.

A bill to amend the act estab\u00ad iishing the Select Commission on Immi\u00ad gration and Refugee Policy to correct an error regarding compensation of the . members, to change the date on which the final report shall be due, to provide 'for adequate funding, and for other pur\u00ad poses; to the Committee on the Judiciary. SELECT COMMISSION ON IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE POLICY Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as Senators know, the Congress acted last year to establish a Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy. to undertake the important and difficult task of reviewing our Nation's immigra\u00b7\u00ad tion laws. The Commission is charged with the responsibility of recommending to Congress in 2 years proposals to to\u00ad tally overhaul and recodify the Immigra\u00ad tion and Nationality Act of 1952, as amended. I will be serving as one of four Senate Judiciary Committee members of this Commission, and I will strongly support its wor.k. It has just been farmed with the appointment last week of four public members by the President, with former Governor Reuben Askew of Florida serv\u00ad ing as chairman. In sup pert of this Commission's im\u00ad portant work, and to correct some small errors and minor deficiencies in the original authorizing legislation, I am introducing the fallowing bill at the re\u00ad quest of Governor Askew and the ad\u00ad ministration. Briefly, the bill does the following: it changes the daily rate of compensation for the public members of the Commis\u00ad sion; it extends the life of the Commis\u00ad sion since it has been delayed by 6 months in starting; it specifies that detailees from Federal agencies may be detailed without reimbursement by the Commission; it specifically authorizes the Commission to procure the services of experts and consultants; and it in\u00ad creases the amount of funds authorized and eliminates section 4 (j) which has as an effect the specific prohibition against the reimbursement of start-up expenses. Mr. President, I strongly recommend the enactment of the amendments in\u00ad cluded in this propcsal. I believe that their enactment will significantly im\u00ad prove the ability of the Commission to conduct a thorough review of our im\u00ad migration and nationality laws and to develop the information required for sound pclicy development. I ask that the text of the bill and a section-by-section analysis be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the bill and analysis were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as fallows: s. 811 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United. States of America in Congress assembled., That Section 4 of Public Law 95-412 is amended- (a) by striking out \"receive the sum of $100\" in subsection (b) (2) and inserting in lieu thereof \"be compensated at a rate not to exceed the dally equivalent of the rate speci\u00ad fied from time to time for grade GS-18 In the General Schedule as prescribed in section 5332 of title 5, United States Code\". (b) by striking out \"September 30, 1980\" in subsection (d) (7) and Inserting In lieu thereof \"March 1. 1981\". (c) by adding after the words in subsec\u00ad tion ( e) by striking out \"$700,000\" in subsec\u00ad tion (i) and inserting in lieu thereof \"$2,450,000\". (e) by striking out section (J) In its en\u00b7 tirety, and Inserting in lieu thereof: \"The Commission is authorized to procure tem\u00ad porary and intermittent services of experts and consultants as are necessary to the extent authorized by section 3109 of title 5, United States Code, but at rates not to exceed the dally equivalent of the rate specified from time to time for grade GS-18 in the General Schedule as prescribed in section 5332 of such title.\" ANALYSIS OF SELECT COMMISSION ON IMMI\u00ad GRATION AND REFuG'EE POLICY AMENDING LEG'ISLATION Section 1 (a) of the b111 changes the rate of compensation for the public members of the Commission to the prevailing rate. Section 1 (b) extends the life of the Com\u00ad mission from September 30, 1980 to March 1, 1981. Section 1 ( c) permits Federal employees detailed to the Commission to serve without reimbursement by the Commission. Section l(d) increases the authorization for the Commission to enable It to accom\u00ad plish the tasks mandated more effectively. Section 1 ( e) removes the provision which has as an effect the specific prohibition against the reimbursement of start-up ex\u00ad penses, and authorizes the Commission to procure the services of experts and con\u00ad sultants.e By Mr. HATFIELD (by request): S. 812. A bill to designate certain areas\u00b7 as wilderness areas, and for other pur\u00ad poses; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I am today introducing legislation, on behalf of the Governor of Oregon, dealing with one of the most significant natural re\u00ad source questions that Congress will face this session. The current roadless area review and evaluation <RARE ll), a com\u00ad prehensive wilderness study now being conducted by the Forest Service, will help determine the use of some 62 million acres of roadless areas on our national forest lands. After the administration makes its final recommendations, Con\u00ad gress will have the responsibility to re\u00ad view them and formally designate wilder\u00ad ness acreage on appropriate lands. In Oregon, some 3 million acres have been studied for their wilderness Poten\u00ad tial. Because of the obvious significance of this decisionmaking process to our State, I believe it appropriate to accom\u00ad modate Governor Atiyeh's request that I introduce his own proposal for use of these lands. I anticipate that various propcsals will be offered such a legisla\u00ad tive vehicle, in order that all points of view may be considered on a matter of this importance. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the bill be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: s. 912 Be tt enacted. by the Senate and Home of Representatives of the Untied. States of America in Congress assembled., That (a) in accordan,ce with section 3 (b) of the Wilder\u00ad ness Act, as amended \u00b7 (16 u.s.c. 1131, 1132), the areas referred to In subsection (b), as generally depleted on maps which are on fl.le and available for public inspection in the office of the Chief, Forest Service, De\u00ad partment of Agriculture, are hereby desig\u00ad nated as wilderness. (b) The following areas are hereby desig\u00ad nated as wilderness areas in a.ccordanpe with subsection acres. (5) A6238-Strawberry Mountain, approxi- mately 13,000 acres. (c) As soon as practicable following the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secre\u00ad ta.ry of Agriculture shall file a map and a legal description of each such wilderness area referred to in subsection (b) of this section with the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources o! the Senate and the committee on Interior and Insular Affairs of the House of Representatives, and such map and de\u00ad scription shall have the same force and e!-6570 ~ONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE March 28, 1979 feet as 1! included in this Act, except that correction of clerical and typographical er\u00ad rors 1Di such maps and descriptions may be made. (d) Such wilderness areas established by this Act shall be administered by the Sec\u00ad retary of Agriculture in accordance with the provisions of the Wllderness Aot governing areas designated by that Act as wilderness areas, except that any reference in such pro\u00ad visions to the e1Iective date of the Wilder\u00ad ness Act shall be deemed to be a. reference to the e1Iective date of this Act. SEc. 2. (a) Notwithstanding any other pro\u00ad vision of law, in the case of all other lands, located within the State of Oregon, which have been studied as a. part of the secretary of Agriculture's Roa.dless Area Review and Evaluation Program (RARE II) and which a.re not designated as wilderness by the first section of this Act, shall, on and after the date of the ena.ctme~t of this Act, be avail\u00ad able for resource utilization other than wil\u00ad derness under the existing Forest Service land management plans appLicable to the national forest within which such lands are located, or under such plans as amended or hereafter modified, and such l&nds shall not be the subject of further studies by any department or agency of the United States !or possible inclusion in the National Wll\u00b7 derness Preservation System.e By Mr. CRANSTON (for himself and Mr. HAYAKAWA) : S. 813. A bill to designate certain lands in the Shasta National Forest, Calif., as the Mount Shasta Wilderness; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Re\u00ad sources. MOUNT SHASTA WILDERNESS Mr. CRANSTON. Mr. President, on be\u00ad half of Senator HAYAKAWA and myself I am introducing for appropriate refer\u00ad ence a 'bill to establish the Mount Shasta wilderness area in California. I'm pleased to report that Congressman HAROLD JOHNSON is introducing the identical bill in the House today. Mount Shasta is renowned as one of the most beautiful mountains in Califor\u00ad nia. Rising more than 14,000 feet in ele\u00ad vation and snowcapped the year round, Mount Shasta is a dominant, awe-inspir\u00ad ing feature that can be seen from many spots in northern California and south\u00ad ern Oregon. It is the largest volcano in the 48 States. And the 10 glaciers that lie on Shasta's upper slopes are the largest in California. Unli.ke most of the world's glaciers, they have grown in recent dec\u00ad ades. Because of the high altitude, sev\u00ad eral uncommon wildflower species occur. But Shasta's most distinctive and spec\u00ad tacular plant is the Shasta red fir which is found in extensive stands. This setting has been extremely popular for hiking and mountain climbing, camping, and cross-country and downhill skiing. Cer\u00ad tainly, Mount Shasta, largely undevel\u00ad oped, deserves a place in our national wilderness preservation system. Mr. President, the bill I am introduc\u00ad ing today calls for the designation of 25 - 980 acres in the Shasta National Fore~t as the Mount Shasta wilderness. The boundaries under this bill are very close to the preferred alternative of the Forest Service in its RARE II recommendations. However, 620 acres have been deleted to exclude Giddy Giddy Gulch encompass\u00ad ing parts of sections 19, 20, and 30. In 1978 an avalanche destroyed five towers of tl~e existing ski lift on Mt. Shasta. Since that time, there has been no replacement of facilities for downhill skiing on the mountain, in large part because the permittee has wanted to re\u00ad locate to lands included in ~ARE II. Some others have proposed expansion of the existing ski runs into the Grey Butte area. I personally would like to see downhill ski opportunities provided on the moun\u00ad tain once again. Moreover, I want to ex\u00ad pedite the Forest service decision on where the skiing should be. But the Forest Service needs to know what the final wilderness boundaries will be and which lands are available for ski con\u00ad sideration before a decision on the best looation can be made. Thus, it is ex\u00ad tremely important that Congress move forward with wilderness legislation for Mt. Shasta at an early date. I want to make it clear that I am not endorsing any specific ski proposal for Mt. Shasta at this time. It is my hope that the various concerned local groups can reach some agreement on the best site. Mediation efforts are currently un\u00ad derway under the auspicies of the Cali\u00ad fornia Office of Planning and Research. I certainly do not wish to preclude the consideration of any potential ski site by placing the area in wilderness. For that reason, I have chosen to exclude from this wilderness bill Sand Flat and Giddy Giddy Gulch which has potential for expert ski runs. It is also my under\u00ad standing that the upper reaches of Giddy Giddy Gulch may need to be managed for avalanche control if there is to be skiing on the lower slopes. Should the local community and the Forest Service decide to provide skiing elsewhere on Mt. Shasta, I would favor amending the wilderness boundaries and adding these areas to the wilderness. They are roadless, and presently qualify for inclusion in the national wilderness system. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the text of the bill be printed ia the RECORD. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: s. 813 Be it enacted by tlie Senate and House of Representatives of tlie United States of America in Congress assembled, That, in furtherance of the purpose of the Wilderness Act of September 3, 1964 (78 Stat. 890, 892; 16 U.S.C. 1132), certain lands in the Shasta National Forest, California, comprising about 25,980 acres, as depleted on a map en\u00ad titled \"Mt. Shasta Wilderness\", dated Feb\u00ad ruary 1979, a.re hereby designated as the Mt. Shasta. Wilderness. SEc. 2. An soon as practicable after this Act takes effect, the Secretary ot Agrtcul ture shall file a map of the wilderness area. and a legal description of its boundaries with the Energy and Natural Resources Committee of the United States Senate and the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives, and such map and de\u00ad scription shall have the same force and ef\u00ad fect as if included in the Act: Provided, however, That correction of clerical and typographical errors in such legal descrip\u00ad tion and map may be made. The map and description of the boundaries of such lands shall be on file and available for public in-spectio,n in the omce of the Chief of the Forest Service, Department of Agriculture. SEc. 3. The wilderness designated by this Act shall be administered by the Secretary of Agriculture in accordance with the pro\u00ad visions of the Wilderness Act governing areas designated by that Act as wilderness .e By Mr. HEINZ: S. 814. A bill to reduce the compensa\u00ad tion of Members of Congress to the rate paid on February 28, 1977, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Govern\u00ad mental Affairs. Mr. HEINZ. Mr. President, in 1977, Congress passed a large pay increase for itself, a move I opposed. I took that posi\u00ad tion because I felt it was not proper for Congress to vote itself a nearly 30 per\u00ad cent pay increase during a time when it was asking the American people to make sacrifices in the war against inflation. How can we expect our anti-inflation policies to have any effect if this Na\u00ad tion's leaders ignore the very program they themselves established? In an effort to make that pay raise politically acceptable, Congress also set a tight limit on the amount of outside earned income a Senator or Congress\u00ad man can receive. I opposed that provi\u00ad sion because I felt the American people should be the ones to decide if their elected omcials are engaging in outside activities which detract from their per\u00ad formance of the job they were elected to do. We have rules\u00b7 guarding against con\u00ad flicts of interest. We have laws requir\u00ad ing full disclosure of every lawmaker's outside activities. I believe they provide the protection and the information every citizen might need to determine if their Senator or Congressman is devot\u00ad ing too much time to outside activities. Today I have voted against the Hart resolution which would have restored the tight limits on outside earned in\u00ad come. I did so because I still believe that the voters in each State should make the decision concerning how much outside income it is proper for their Senators to earn. However, I am still distressed that Congress has not llved up to the political bargain it made in 1977 to get its pay raise. The $12,800 pay raise was \"justi\u00ad ~ed\" by the outside earnings limitation, it was said at the time. I opposed both provisions for the reasons I have out\u00ad lined, but since the Senate has chosen to change the rules under which the pay raise was \"justified,\" I believe it is only fair that the senate should also roll back the pay raise itself. Accord\u00ad ingly, I am introducing legislation that will return our salaries to the level that existed before the pay raise. By Mr. JAVITS: S. 815. A bill to exempt programs of the Federal National Mortgage Associa\u00ad tion from state usury laws, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. FANNIE MAE PREEMPTION e Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I am in\u00ad troducing today the Home Financing Leveraging Act of 1979, a bill to exempt March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENA TE 6571 programs of the Federal Nation~! Mort\u00ad gage \"Fannie Mae\" from state usury laws. Congresswoman FER\u00ad RARO has introduced similar legislation in the House. This legislation would make ~ible the utilization of Fannie Mae's urban loan participation program in all urban areas. PresentJ.y, Puerto Rico and 16 states-Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Okla\u00ad homa, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia-\u00ad have State usury laws that are lower than the prevailing interest rate at Fan\u00ad nie Mae auctions, thus eff ectlvely pre\u00ad cluding lenders in their urban areas from participating in the program. Fannie Mae began the urban loan participation program in late 1978 with $200 million and expanded it by another $500 million in February of thls year. Under this program, a lender wtth at least $250,000 in mortgag~ in an urban area may pool these mortgages and sell 60 to 90 percent of the pool to Fannie Mae. FNMA then sells these mortgages to private investors at biweekly auctions, at rates that now are exceeding 11 per\u00ad cent, FNMA returns the sale proceeds to the lender, and the lender is required to relend the money for urban homes or businesses. By i'ts urban loan participation pro\u00ad gram, Fannie Mae is providing a market for loans, thus giving urban lenders addi\u00ad tional lending capacity. And, by purchas\u00ad ing only 60 to 90 percent of a pool, Fannie Mae assists in keeping lenders concerned with the viability of the urban areas where the mortgaged property is located. With interest rates at high levels, lend\u00ad ers in many States are effectively pre\u00ad cluded from participation in the Fannie Mae program. New York, for example, has a State usury law that for State\u00ad chartered institutions is now at 9 % per\u00ad cent and for federally chartered institu\u00ad tions at one point over the Federal dis\u00ad count rate, thus 10% percent now. With participation loans selling for over 11 percent, New York institutions are not likely to participate. Preemption of State usury laws is not an unfamiliar issue to the Congress. In 1975 the Senate adopted an amendment I introduced to exempt activities under the Emergency Home Purchase Act of 1974 from State usury laws. It was en\u00ad acted as a part of Public Law 94-50. Mr. President, I have often advocated additional Federal moneys for the dis\u00ad tressed urban areas of our Nation. Today I urge Federal action that will not in\u00ad volve Federal money but will permit pri\u00ad vate money to work for the betterment of our urban areas. Enactment of the Home Finance Leveraging Act of 1979 will re\u00ad move the roadblock that prevents lenders in many States from leveraging their lending funds. Prompt action is necessary so that the lenders in these 16 States, with about half of the total U.S. population may participate in this program. The Housing SubcoJ?-mit~e of the House Banking Comnuttee is holding hearings on Con\u00ad gresswoman F'ERRARo's bill today. I urge my colleagues of the Committee on ~anking, Housing, and Urban Affairs to ~pve equally rapidly and give this bill their careful consideration. By Mr. HAYAKAWA <for himself arid Mr. YOUNG): amend the Social Se\u00ad curity Act to provide that any alien re\u00ad ceiving benefits under certain needs re\u00ad lated provisions of such act shall be considered to be a public charge, to pro\u00ad vide for attribution of a sponsor's in\u00ad come and resources to an alien, and to provide a 3-year residency requirement for aliens who receive certain benefits; to the Committee on Finance. \u00b7 e Mr. HAYAKAWA. Mr. President, to\u00ad day I am introducing a bill to amend the Social Security Act as it relates to newly arrived legal aliens applying for and re\u00ad ceiving public assistance. I ask that it be ref erred to the appropriate committee. Unless your State is particularly af\u00ad fected you may be unaware of the ex\u00ad tensive abuse of the intent of our welfare programs by newly arrived legal aliens. Did you know that in the five States of New Jersey, Florida, Illinois, New York, and California approximately 37,511 newly arrived legal aliens receive $72 million in supplemental security income benefits in 1 year-$31.6 million were paid in California alone. A recent Gov\u00ad ernment Accounting Office report shows that 63 percent applied for and received SSI benefits within 1 year of their ar\u00ad rival in the United States. The Immigration and Nationality Act says that an alien likely to require public assistance will be denied admission to the United States. It also states that if an alien becomes a \"public charge\" within 5 years of entry he is subject to deporta\u00ad tion. However, 30 days after he arrives in the United States he can sign up for financial assistance and free medical care under the supplemental security income program originally enacted to help our aged and disabled. I am appalled by the horror stories de\u00ad scribing the flagrant abuse of these weak laws. Guy Wright, a noted columnist for the San Francisco Examiner, has been urging Congress for years to change these laws\". Mr. Wright tried to tell us that while Congress was overlooking the loophole in the SSI law, sick and elderly aliens were arriving in this country and within 30 days receiving SSI benefits. One example he used in a column on the subject involved a 14-year-old mentally retarded boy and his parents. Provisions in the immigration laws prevent entry to mentally retarded, with few exceptions, and those are with personal guarantees that the alien will not become a public burden. To paraphrase Mr. Wright: The parents and two other children came here from the Philippines and re\u00ad ceived permanent resident status. Under the law, the retarded boy was denied en\u00ad try. However, once the family was settled here they filed an \"application for waiver on the grounds of excludability\" on be\u00ad half of their son. A San Francisco doctor signed an affidavit that said, \"I agree to supply any treatment or observation necessary\" and declared \"satisfactory fi\u00ad nancial arrangements have been made.\" According to Mr. Wright, in spite of the solemn pledges made and signed the boy was soon enrolled in a mental retar\u00ad dation program. He is now signed up for a lifetime of mental therapy at taxpayer expense, plus his parents can draw SSI payments for caring for him. Also, when the boy turns 18 he will be eligible for a lifetime SSI pension. To further illustrate, I will relate an example of f allure to honor an affidvit of support for a newly arrived alien which is taken from the most recent GAO report on \"Aliens Who Receive SSI.\" A 76-year-old alien entered the U.S. in March, 1977 and applied and became eligible for SSI benefits in April. Before she im\u00ad migrated, her daughter and son-in-law had signed an amdavit of support promising she would not become a public charge. They cited a combined annual income of about $17,100 and a net worth of about $62,000 as evidence of their ab111ty to provide support. The alien indicatd on her SSI application that the daughter did not provide any as\u00ad sistance. The courts have pointed out the in\u00ad consistencies in the laws by ruling that an alien is not subject to deportation for . applying for . public assistance be\u00ad cause the term \"public charge\" is not defined in the Social Security Act. They have also said that a lack of residency requirement prevents an SSI recipient from becoming a \"public charge.\" I believe the bill I am introducing to\u00ad day will correct those inconsistencies. This bill sets specific requirements an alien must meet to apply for and receive SSI benefits, medicaid or Aid to Families With Dependent Children. It will amend the Social Security Act to require a 3- year residency requirement before an alien may apply for public assistance under either SS!, Aid to Families With Dependent Children or medicaid. Those aliens who become blind or disabled after arriving in this country will be exempt from the provisions of this bill and will be evaluated individually. My bill pro\u00ad vides for attribution of the sponsor's in\u00ad come and resources in determining an alien's need for assistance and specifies a 3-year residency period. Finally, the bill will amend the Social Security Act fo include \"definition of public charge,\" which I feel is the most important aspect of this legislation. I realize this becomes a tight and in some ways unbending law. Legal aliens will, under this law, be subject to depor\u00ad tation if they become a \"public charge\" by applying for and receiving public as\u00ad sistance. I firmly believe that the empha\u00ad sis should and will be put on screening and evaluating the applications of in\u00ad coming aliens. I hope that the courts will interpret this legislation in such a way as to make the affidavit of support bind:. ing on the sponsor. I think this legisla\u00ad tion should accomplish that goal. Your support and cosponsorship of this legislation is welcomed. By Mr. JACKSON (for himself, Mr. MORGAN, and Mr. GoLD\u00ad VVATER) <by request) : S. 817. A bill to amend the Act of July 2, 1940, to increase the amount au\u00ad thorized to be appropriated for the Canal 6572 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENA TE March 28, 1979 Zone Biological Area; to the Committee on Rules and Administration. Mr. JACKSON. Mr. President, on be\u00ad half of Senator GOLDWATER, Senator MORGAN, and myself, I introduce a bill on behalf of and at the request of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution. Senators GOLDWATER, MORGAN and I serve as the Senate Members of the Board of Regents. The legislation we are intro\u00ad ducing today has been approved by the Board of Regents to meet the needs of the Institution in relation to its respon\u00ad sibilities for Barro Colorado Island in the Panama Canal Zone. By the Act of July 2, 194-0 <54 Stat. 724) the Congress set aside Barro Colo\u00ad rado Island in order to preserve and conserve its national features for re\u00ad search purposes, and authorized the ap\u00ad propriation of $10,000 for necessary administrative and maintenance ex\u00ad penses related to the island. Sub\u00ad sequently , Public Law 89-280 approved October 20, 1965, increased the author\u00ad ization to $350,000. At its meeting on January 22, 1979, the Board of Regents requested its con\u00ad gressional members to introduce and support legislation raising the celling on appropriations from $350,000 to $750,000. Although current obligations are within the present statutory limit, the pressure of increasing costs and the need for im\u00ad provements to the Canal Zone Biological Area maintained by the Smithsonian on the island indicate that the limit will be reached in the near future. On March 17, 1977-also at the request of the Board of Regents-senator PELL, who was then a regent, Senator GoLn\u00ad WATER and I introduced S. 1031 raising the ceiling to $600,000. That bill was amended in the Rules Committee to in\u00ad crease the authorization level to $750,000, and passed the Senate in May 1977. How\u00ad ever, the other body did not complete action on the measure. The bill introduced today would raise the authorization ceiling to $750,000- the :figure recommended by both the Smithsonian and the Senate Rules Com\u00ad mittee-and approved by the Senate in the last Congress. By Mr. PRESSLER: S. 819. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to promote the use of alcohol as a motor fuel and as an additive to motor vehicle fuels, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Naturaal Resources. CLEAN Am Acr AMENDMENTS or 1979 Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, several Members of the House of Representa\u00ad tives-led by the Honorable DAN GLICK\u00ad MAN of Kansas-have recently intro\u00ad duced legislation relating to the ex\u00ad panded use of alcohol as a fuel by using some of our country's surplus agricul\u00ad tural products. I am today introducing this same legis\u00ad lation on the Senate side of the Capitol that that a dialogue can begin and we can work toward eventual enactment of this important legislation. In addition, Senator FRANK CHURCH of Idaho had a bill pending before the last session of the 95th Congress-a. 2533-which was known as the Gasohol Motor Fuel Act of 1978. I have taken that proposal-along along with Congressman GLICKMAN's Al\u00ad House side as H.R. and H.R. 2648, and had the Senate Legislative Counsel's office up\u00ad date the Gasohol Motor Fuel Act and am introducing them together in a pack\u00ad age for the appropriate Senate commit\u00ad tees to consider. As a member of the Senate Environ\u00ad ment and Public Works Committee, we will be studying the Alcohol Fuels-En\u00ad vironmental Coordination Act of 1979- part of the bill I am introducing today\u00ad the measure will amend the Clean Air Act to direct the Environmental Protec\u00ad tion Agency to require those retail gaso\u00ad line marketers which are currently re\u00ad quired to sell unleaded fuel to sell blends including at least 10 percent alcohol rather than unleadeed, as supplies of alcohol-gasoline blends become a.cie\u00ad quately available as determined by the EPA Administrator and the Secretary of Energy jointly. It is clear that alcohol fuels are the only liquid fuels that can be used in ex\u00ad isting vehicles other than gasoline. In testimony before the Energy Develop\u00ad ment and Applications Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Technology, Acting Assistant Secretary for Energy Technology John Deutch commented that, in the event of an em\u00ad bargo, he would \"absolutely'' favor the mandated sale of alcohol-gasoline blends at service stations. The EPA has already certified that stations may comply with the requirement that they sell unleaded gasoline by selling alcohol-gasoline blends instead. And the most problematic immediate motor fuel shortfalls are ex\u00ad pected to be in supplies of unleaded gaso\u00ad line. There needs to be an assured retail market \u00b7before we can expect to see sig\u00ad nificant private sector investment in the needed alcohol production. The modified mandate provided for in this section would not be burdensome since unleaded pumps could simply be converted to handle the \u00b7Plends. In addition, the bill will amend the Clean Air Act to provide the Adminis\u00ad trator of the Environmental Protection Agency authority to permit emissions in excess of specific standards for individual pollutants which might result from use of blends of alcohol and unleaded gaso\u00ad line, provided that the Administrator certifies that the use of motor fuels ap\u00ad proved under this section will have an overall positive impact on air quality. Mr. President, in recent EPA testing, alcohol-gasoline blends have resulted in significant reductions in most types of emissions, including hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide; however, specific standards for evaporative emissions have been surpassed in some tests. The EPA Administrator has granted a temporary waiver allowing alcohol fuels marketing to continue, but a long-term answer to this potential roadblock is needed. The fact that so many owners of cars having catalytic converters have been using leaded fuel and thereby creating a more serious pollution problem than existed before passage of the Clean Air Act makes it even more important that we f acllitate use of alcohol blend fuels which will eliminate the problems with \"ping\u00ad ing\" and poor performance that have caused many of those drivers to \"take things into their own hands.\" This pro\u00ad posed language will give the EPA the au\u00ad thority and flexibility it needs to achieve its goal of cleaner air. The measure also will direct the De\u00ad partment of Energy and the Environ\u00ad mental Protection Agency to cooperate in eft'ort to facilitate expanded produc\u00ad tion and distribution of alcohol for fuel use. Mr. President, there has been inade\u00ad quate coordination between various Fed\u00ad eral agencies on questions relating to the use of alcohol to supplement our fuel supplies. This language will put the Con\u00ad gress on record in directing the coopera\u00ad tion among agencies essential to facili\u00ad tate alcohol fuels use in the near term .. I ask unanimous consent that the blll be printed in the RECORD. These being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: 8. 819 Be it enacted by the Senate and H<nue of Bepresentattves of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That this Act may be cited as the \"Clean Air Act Amendments of 1979\". :rmDINGS SEC. 2. The Congress fi.nds that- ( 1) the United States is currently Import\u00ad ing large quantities of crude oll; (2) a substantial portion of this crude oll is needed for the production of gasoline sold in interstate commerce; and (3) renewable resources in the United States can provide a sufficient source of alco\u00ad hol suitable for blending with gasollne to decrease the need for Imported on. TITLE I-CLEAN AIR ACT AMENDMENTS RETAIL SALES 01' UNLEADED GASOLINE SEc. 101. (a) Section 211 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545) is amended by adding the following new subsection at the end th.ert!of: \"(h) (1) Any regulation promulgated by the Administrator under this section which requires any person to offer unleaded gaso\u00ad line for sale at any gasoline retail outlet shall be a.mended by the Administrator to require such person to offer for sale at such outlet a blend of unleaded gasoline and alcohol which contains not less than 10 per\u00ad cent alcohol in lieu of the present require\u00ad ment that unleaded gasoline be offered for sale. The requirement contained in the pre\u00ad ceding sentence shall apply to a person only if the Administrator and the Secretary of Energy jointly determine that supplies of suc.h a blend are reasonably available to such person. The requirement contained in this subsection may be waived by the Adminis\u00ad trator with respect to any filling station for any period specified by t'b.e Administrator 1f the Administrator determines that- \" (A) compliance with the requirements of this subsection would result in severe eco\u00ad nomic hardship; or \"(B) additional time is required t.o pre\u00ad pare existing storage tanks at such station for alcohol gasoline blends. \"(2) For purposes of this subsection, the terms 'unleaded gasoline' and 'retail outlet' shall have the meanings provided under reg\u00adulations promulgated by the Administrator.\".

A bill to prohibit the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare from banning the use of nitrites in meat with\u00ad out sufficient proof of any carcinogenic effect nitrites may be represented to have, or until the development of a satis\u00ad factory altemaive to protect the public health from botulism; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, jointly, by unanimous con\u00ad sent. USE OF NITRITE IN MEAT Mr. JEPSEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to prohibit the Secretary of Health, Education, and Wel\u00ad fare and the Secretary of Agriculture from banning the use of nitrite in meat without sufficient proof of any carcino\u00ad genic effect nitrites may be represented to have or until the development of a satisfactory alternative to protect the public health from botulism. I believe this legislation is a commonsense ap\u00ad proach to a confused and tentative situa-March !8, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 6575 tion. In a joint release on Augw;t H. 1978, the U.S. Department of Agricqlt\u00b5re ~nd the Food and Drug Administration an\u00ad nounced the findings of Dr. Paul M. New\u00ad berne of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology which indicated a possibility that nitrite caused cancer in laboratory rats. There was speculation that nitrite could be banned from the market based on this information. In early March news articles reported that there was reason to believe the Justice Department would issue an opinion that would result in an immediate ban of nitrite. We have been witnessing a political football that has been kicked, passed and fumbled until it is unclear who has the ball, let alone what the score is. This bill is a practical approach to this matter, preventing any kind of extreme actions without proper evidence. Sodium nitrite in meat prevents botu\u00ad lism and protects our families from fatal disease. The reason for its presence is clear and historically established. Fur\u00ad thermore, nitrite provides a safeguard against mishandling by manufacturers, distributors, retails or consumers. A re\u00ad cent USDA study concluded that 63 per\u00ad cent of the 25,000 households surveyed ran a \"high risk\" of food borne illness because of a lack of awareness of basic safe food handling practices. In addition to this health benefit nitrite gives cured meats their special fiavor and appear\u00ad ance. To this date, we are not familiar with a tested and proven substitute for nitrite. Mr. President, I send the blll to the desk and ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: s. 818 Be n enacted by the Senate and H0tue of Bepre&entattvea of the United Statu of Amerka in Congrua aaaembled, That neither the Secretary of Agriculture nor the Secre\u00ad tary of Health, Education, and Welfare shall take any ~ctlon under the Federal Meat In\u00ad spection Act or the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit the use of nitrites in meat or meat food products solely on the basts of any carcinogenic effect on humans that nitrites may be represented to have, unless- (a) the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Jointly determine, based on clear, unequtv\u00ad ocal, and convincing evidence, that nitrites, when used 1n meat or meat food products, have a signUicant carcinogenic effect on hu\u00ad mans, or (b) the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Jointly determine that there 1s commercially available a substance for use in meat and meat food products ( 1) that 1s effective in protecting the publlc health from botullsm, and (2) that has substantially the same ef\u00ad fect on meat and meat food products as ni\u00ad trites, and (3) the use of whlch wlll not impose an unreasonable economic burden on consume?$ or meat processors.

Mr. HELMS submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to S. 349, a bill to increase the authorization for the Council on Wage and Price Stability, and to extend the duration of such Council. AMENDMENT S. 349 TO REPEAL THE CREDIT CONTROL ACT Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, every day I receive reports that the financial mar\u00ad kets in this country are growing more unstable in part because of fears that the administration may impose credit controls under the Credit Control Act of 1969. Financial analyst Don Conlan predicts a 40-percent likelihood of credit controls. Morris Cohen says such controls seem more probable now; Barron's editor, Robert Blieberg predicts a 60-percent chance of credit controls. Alan Green\u00ad span has said interest rates are at \"polit\u00ad ically acceptable limits.\" Recent reports from Wall Street suggested that controls would be imposed in 2 months. Such rumors and predictions can not help stabilize the markets. Only repeal of this onerous law can quiet this unrest. Indeed, failure to re\u00ad peal the law will accelerate speculation about control implementation. To stabilize financial markets, it is vitally important that we repeal the standby authority to impose massive, arbitrary controls on the financial system. The President has said he does not want wage and price control authority. It is only consistent for us to clean up the Federal Code by removing this ex\u00ad tension of authority over the financial system. The Credit Control Act provides for Government setting the \"price\" for credit.Itstates: Whenever the President determines that such action is appropriate or necessary for the purpose of preventing or controllin~ in\u00ad flation he may authorize the Board of Gov\u00ad ernors of the Federal Reserve System to reg\u00ad ulate and control any or all extensions of credit. When invoked by the President, the Credit Control Act arms the Federal Re\u00ad serve with powers broader than those wielded to control credit during World War II and the Korean war. It provides blanket authority for: First, registering any or all extensions of credit and licensing all lenders; such lenders would be subject to regular fees as well as penalties for violations of reg\u00ad ulations promulgated under this act; Second, prohibiting any credit for pur\u00ad poses deemed inappropriate by the Fed\u00ad eral Reserve and prescribing maximum amounts of credit that may be extended with any loan or purchase; Third, establishing maximum rates of interest, minimum down payments on purchases, and conditions for repaying loans. \u00b7 While many would argue that cre~t controls are unworkable and counter\u00ad productive on economic grounds, the first and most obvious objection to the Credit Control Act is political. The statute is so loosely drawn and confers such vast powers on the President and-through him-on the Federal Reserve Board that no credit transactions would be outside the purview of this law, once the author\u00ad ity is invoked by the President. The invo\u00ad cation of virtually unlimited power by the President is hardly consistent with the post-Watergate mood of Congress, with the desire of the. Congress to limit the powers of the President and to regain those of its own which it had heretofore delegated. In the 94th Congress, Public Law 94- 412 repealed or greatly modified numerous laws which gave the President great powers under \"emergency\" statutes such as the War Powers and Trading with the Enemy Acts. The Credit Control Act should have been considered in this context, but ap\u00ad parently was overlooked. It might be argued that credit controls may become necessary under certain economic conditions. If so, they should be justified in the light of those condi\u00ad tions. Congress should know to whom they would apply and how. Should they apply only to consumer and housing credit as in World War II or the Korean War? What types of consumer and hous\u00ad ing credit? Should they apply to small business as well as big business? Should limitations or conditions apply only to the down payment and duration, or to the rate of interest as well? The controls can't cure inflation, but could push the economy into a reces\u00ad sion-while at the same time lessening pressure on the Fed to moderate money growth and lessening pressure on the administration for spending limits. The Treasury Department does not want the control authority repealed. Treasury opposes repeal because the au\u00ad thority is only for controlling inflation. But this authority cannot control infla\u00ad tion. The\u00b7 authority can control one symptom of inflation-one symptom of inordinate expansion of the money supply. Treasury opposes repeal because the Credit Control Act authority is only \"for a limited duration.\" Unfortunately, the Treasury is wrong, for the act specif\u00ad ically states that the controls may be imposed by the President \"for such time as he may determine.\" That period of time could be forever. Treasury opposes repeal because the authority \"may be all that\u00b7 stands be\u00ad tween stability and widespread disloca\u00ad tion in the short term.\" But it is the existence of the stand-by authority . that is causing instability. The partial imposi\u00ad tion of credit controls in 1971 hurt more than helped, and it is inflation and con- trols themselves that cause dislocation. Controls do not prevent it. And finally, Treasury opposes repeal because: It is. b,etter to have the authority in place for use in emergency circumstances than to have to request it when needed. This rationalization should be decried by every advocate of Congress exerting its proper role in our Government. This simplistic justification for dictatorial power has been rejected by recent Con\u00ad gresses with the passage of the War Powers Act, the National Emergencies Act and other pieces of legislation specif\u00ad ically limiting the exercise of broad Presidential powers and requiring con\u00ad gressional approval of certain acts. Mr. President, the time for repealing this unjustifiable act is now. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that excerpts from my comments of January 15 on this issue be printed in the RECORD, that an article from the April 1979 issue of \"Banking\" magazine which I have authored be printed the in the RECORD, that the Treasury De\u00ad partment comments on S. 35 be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: [From the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, Jan. 15, 1979] STANDBY CREDIT CONTROLS SHOULD BE REPEALED Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, at the end of the 95th Congress, I introduced legislation which would repeal the Credit Control Act of 1969. I did so with the hope that the Treasury Department would have an opportunity to consider the bill in the 3 months between Congress adjourn'ment and beginning of the new Congress. Unfortunately, Treasury has not done so. I also asked the chairman of the Federal Reserve Boa.rd, the Honorable William E. Miller for his views and he agreed that the dislocations caused by credit controls would be disruptive and costly to the economy. He felt, however, that standby controls should stay on the books, stating: The distortion which such wide-ranging credit controls would produce, both during and after the period when they were in effect, makes them unacceptable except under the most exigent circumstances. You have questioned whether the present authority should even be on the books. In my view, the shortcomings of mandatory credit controls are so well known as to assure that they would be used only in an emer\u00ad gency situation. If such a situation arose, and selective credit controls appeared to be necessary, it would be helpful to have the au\u00ad thority for such controls already in place. Moreover, the fact that mandatory controls could be imposed may well contribute to the success of voluntary guidelines, which of course are a much better means for generat\u00ad ing desired flows of credit. For these reasons, the standby authority contained in the Credit Control Act probably serves a useful purpose. I am glad that Chairman Miller agrees with the assessment that the controls would im\u00ad pose massive costs on the economy. But, his arguments in favor of standby credit controls could easily be used in support of standby controls over wages and prices. I do not be\u00ad lieve that the Chairman of the Fed has advo\u00ad cated such controls, but there may be some inconsistency in not advocating standby con\u00ad trols for wages and prices if' we are to have standby controls tor credit. I !rankly view such controls as mere treatments or the symptom of inflation-not treatment of its cause. One sure way !or the Federal Government to ca.use more trouble than it eliminates is to March ~8, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 6577 attack a. problem by treating the o\u00b5tward manifestations and not the root ca.w;es. Today we hear more and more people say\u00ad ing that wage-and-price controls can be effective to .stop 1nfia.t1on. It is as if we say allowing no thermometer to register above 98.6 o ls going to stop fevers. As President Carter himself has said: Wage and price controls, mandatory wage and price controls, would be 111-advlsed and also counterproductive. I don't think they would work. We know that there ls now on the books no emergency authority allowing the Presi\u00ad dent to impose wage-and-price controls. I hope there wm never be such controls. They could only serve to further mask the real culprit: The U.S. Government. Specifically, the culprit ls inordinate Federal spending, ca.using Federal deficits and expansion of the money supply brought on by the Federal Reserve System's monetization of those growing Federal deficits. Without Federal deficits, we could expect more responsibil\u00ad ity from our monetary authorities. We could expect ra.tionaJ, noninfia.tlona.ry monetary policies. I find, however, that there remains on the books in the Federal Code an onerous piece of legislation which purports to be a means of \"combating inflation.\" In fact, it ls little more than a means of providing total Federal control of the financial system of this country. I speak of Public Law 91-151, the Credit Control Act of 1969. In 1969, the Nation was beginning to suf\u00ad fer from the inflation ca.used by the \"guns and butter\" Federal deficits of the late 1960's. In S. 2577-Public Law 91-151, the Congress approved a bill initially aimed at expanding earlier legislation relating to \"dlsintermedia.tion\" of funds from savings and loan associations to banking institu\u00ad tions. The main controversy evidently cen\u00ad tered around housing credit, and the b111 pro\u00ad vides for massive controls over all issuance Federal Home Loan Bank lending. Of interest ls that there is almost no record of debate on one portion of the bill, title II, which pro\u00ad vides for massive controls over all issuance of credit. Portions of 12 U.S.C. 1904 and 1905 read a.s follows: \u00a7 1904. Credit controls (a.) Whenever the President determines that such action is necessary or appropriate for the purpose of preventing or controlling inflation generated by the extension of credit in an excessive volume, the President may authorize the Board to regulate and control any or all extensions of credit. \u00a7 1905. Extent of control. The Boa.rd, upon being authorized by the President under section 1904 of this title and for such period of time as he may determine, may by regulation ( 1) require transactions or persons or classes of either to be registered or licensed. (2) prescribe appropriate limitations, terms, and conditions for any such registra\u00ad tion or license. (3) provide for suspension of any such reg\u00ad istration or license for violation of any pro\u00ad vision thereof or of any regulation, rule, or order prescribed under this Act. (4) prescribe appropriate requirements as to the keeping of records and as to the form, contents, or substantive provisions of con\u00ad tracts, liens, or any relevant documents. (5) prohibit solicitations by creditors which would encourage evasion or avoidance of the requirements of any regulation, li\u00ad cense, or registration under this Act. (6) prescribe the maximum amount of credit whioh may be extended on, or In con\u00ad nection with, any loan, purchase, or other extension of credit. CXXV--414-Part 5 (7) prescribe the maximum rate of inter\u00ad est, maximum maturity, minimum periodic payment, maximum period \u00b7 between -pay\u00ad ments, and any other speclflcatlon or limi\u00ad tation of the terms and conditions o( any extension of credit. \u00b7 (8) prescribe the methods of determining purchase prices or market values or other. bases for computing permissible extensions of credit or required downpayment. (9) prescribe special or different terms, conditions, or exemptions with respect to\u00b7 new or used goods, minimum original cash payments, temporary credits which a.re merely incidental to cash purchases, pay\u00ad ment or deposits usable to liquidate credits, and other adjustments or special situations. (10) prescribe maximum ratios, applicable to any class of either creditors or borrowers or both, of loans of one or more types or of all types. (A) to deposits of one or more types or of all types. (B) to assets of one or more types or of all types. (11) prohibit or limit any extensions of credit under any circumstances the Board deems appropriate. In other words, if the President declares that \"such action ls necessary for controlling inflation,\" he might set all kinds and varieties of restrictions on the normal utilization of credit. It ls nothing more than price controls on money. The interest rate charged on money is no more than the price charged for \"rent\u00ad ing\" money. That this blll was passed so swiftly, and evidently with such little conroversy, indi\u00ad cates that often Congress does not give seri\u00ad ous enough consideration to the problems it addresses. During consideration by the Senate of this proposal, I hope we can call on the expertise of our colleagues who worked to effect the passage of the \"National Emergencies Act,\" Public Law 94-412, a proper and important piece of legislation which repealed numerous laws which gave the President vast powers under various \"states of emergency., declara\u00ad tions. I hope that the good work that was done to llmit the arbitrary authority of the Executive branch might be used as a founda\u00ad tion to further trim this power now held by the President. In my mind it could be used for little, 1f any, good. In developing the case for this b111, there is the entire question of academic opinion. I have a feeling that there would be preci\u00ad ous few scholars and experts in the fields of finance and economics who could support such exercise of power except under the most d!re of circumstances. IT'S TIME To TAKE THE CREDIT CONTROL ACT OFF THE BOOKS The year was 1975, and the Budget Com\u00ad mittee of the U.S. Senate had just begun to function. Some of the Committee's staff members were expressing concern that they might not be able to find an economist to ad\u00ad vocate a planned economy. Someone jested that the best such \"expert\" might be Albert Speer, Adolf Hitler's economic potentate. There is a degree of comfort to be found in the fact that there are very few credible economists who advocate centrally planned economies-for the simple reason that plan\u00ad ned economies have never worked, and never will. 0But Albert Speer might feel at home with a ten-year-old law called the \"Credit Con\u00ad trol Act of 1969\" (Public Law 91-151). It is a piece of legislation that should never have been drafted, let alone enacted by Congress. Unwise legislation, embraced by polltlcians seeking easy answers, ls neither remarkable nor unique in Washington. D.C. But the Credit Control Act of 1969 ts remarkable tn that it ls a totaJ contradiction of the best interests of our country. The Credit Control Act of 1969 provides standby authority for the President to direct the Federal Reserve Boa.rd to jury-rig al\u00ad most every aspect of the U.S. financial sys\u00ad tem. With a simple order, he ls empowered to institute interest-rate controls; to llcense and regulate all issues of credit; and to set the \"form, contents, or substantive provi\u00ad sions of contracts, Hens, or any relevant documents.\" Also granted to the Federal Reserve Board is the power to \"prescribe the maximum ma\u00ad turity, minimum periodic payment, maxi\u00ad mum period between payments, and any other specification or limitation of the terms and conditions of any extension of credit.\" The Board may, under this law, \"prescribe maximum ratios, appllcable to any class of either creditors or borrowers or both, of loans of one or more types or of all types\" and may \"prohibit or limit any extensions of credit under any circumstances the Board deems appropriate.\" The incredible provisions go on and on, llke Tennyson's Brook, but the examples just cited indicate the scope of the Credit Control Act of 1969. The blank check this law provides ls awe\u00ad some. That its controls over the marketplace cannot possibly work, and that implementa\u00ad tion of them would surely dislocate financial markets is equally frightening. As we have seen with every utilization of arbitrary eco\u00ad nomic controls, such controls don't work\u00ad they destroy. The law provides that the Federal Reserve Board may prescribe methods of determining purchase prices or market values for credit purposes . Just imagine, for example, an \"Of\u00ad fice of Market Values,\" which would have hundreds of bureaucrats checking loans to make sure they were based on \"fair\" values. There would, of course, have to be a \"Divi\u00ad sion of Market Value Appeals,\" and all would be within a \"Commission on Consumer Credit.\" Business Credit would have its own agency, as would International Credit, and probably Minority Credit and Women's Cred\u00ad it, and Left-Handed Episcopal Credit. A combination of Parkinson's Law and the Peter Principle would flourish. The hiring of multitudes of new federal administrators might even cause unemployment to vanish. The paper companies and the printing houses would prosper-think of the ava\u00ad lanche of new federal forms! Office space in Washington-already tight because of the need to house existing federal regulatory agencies-would surely double in price. The Credit Control Act came at a time when the guns-and-butter deficits of the '60's were ta.king their toll on the dollar and inflation was accelerating. It may be that the Democratic-controlled Congress wanted to give President Nixon extraordinary power to curb inflation via controls to make sure that he would be blamed for inflation. The fact that Congress and the President accelerated federal spending and increased federal def\u00ad icits indicates that both were unwllllng to face a very clear economic fact of life con\u00ad cerning inflation. For inflation ls, has been, and always wlll be, a monetary phenomenon. It is an increase in the supply of money in excess of any in\u00ad crease in the output of the economy. That there ls widespread avoidance of this fa.ct ls an indictment of responsible businessmen, academicians and public leaders. That some\u00ad thing like the Credit Control Act could be passed by Congress is a measurement of the degree to which scapegoats are constantly sought when the federal government creates inflation. Federal Reserve Chairman Wiliiam Miller 6578 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE March 28, 1979 agrees that imposition of the controls are \"unacceptable except under the most exigent circumstances,\" and the \"shortcomings are so well known as to assure that they would be used only in an emergency situation .\" But compare, if we can, another exercise of Presidential authority-the ability to wage war. War is generally unacceptable except under the most exigent circumstances, but the widespread awareness of that fact has not led Congress to relinquish the power to de\u00ad clare war. Moreover, Congress has limited the President 's ab111ty to conduct war without its approval. The authority to control the na\u00ad tion's financial system is less logically given to the President. The Credit Control Act states that con\u00ad trols can be imposed whenever the President thinks they are \"necessary or appropriate for the purpose of preventing or controlling in\u00ad flation generated by the extension of credit in an excessive volume.\" If the Federal Re\u00ad serve System increases the money supply or allows it to increase faster than real output there wlll be infl.a.tion-controls or no con\u00ad trols. Saying that the extension of credit generates inflation is like calling the inordi\u00ad nate multiplication of cells in a tumor the cause of cancer. By imposing controls, government disrupts the economy in three ways. First, it takes the pressure off the Federal Reserve Board to restrain money growth. When wage and price controls (and some implementation of the Credit Control Act) were imposed in 1971, the Federal Reserve Boa.rd felt able to open the money gates. Second, government stops the market from performing the most important function of allocating credit. Political judgments a.re substituted for economic judgments. The \"needs\" of politically powerful groups a.re substituted for the high bidder in the market. Third, government adds to inflation, the problem that controls a.re supposed to be solving. When the economy's ab111ty to allo\u00ad cate credit on a rational basis is crippled, it loses efficiency. Costs go up, and output tends to stagnate. Given any specific rate of money supply growth, reduced output wm mean higher price levels-more inflation. The answer? Repeal the Credit Control Act of 1969, which would be accomplished by my bill, s. 35. The prerequisite? Education of public policy makers of the importance of this issue. Send the word to your elected Representa\u00ad tives. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, Washington, D.C., Mareh 20, 1979. Hon. WILLIAM PROXMIRE, Chairman , Committee on Banking , Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washing\u00ad ton, D.C. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Reference ls made to your request for the views of the Department of the Treasury concerning S. 35, \"To amend the Credit Control Act.\" The b111 would repeal the Credit Control Act (12 U.S.C. 1901, et seq.) which permits the President to authorize the Federal Re\u00ad serve Boa.rd to regulate and control any or all extensions of credit whenever the Presi\u00ad dent determines that such action is necessary or appropriate for the purpose of preventing or controlling inflation generated by the ex\u00ad tension of credit in excessive volume. In brief, the Act gives the Federal Reserve Board broad powers to allocate credit. These powers include the authority to place limitations on interest rates, maturities , and amounts of credit in any transaction, and to prohibit ex\u00ad tensions of credit. The authority to allocate credit, however , must be conferred by the President for anti-inflation purposes and for only such period of time as he determines. It ts the only statute which currently author-izes the imposition of mandatory economic controls. Thi~ DElpartment ts opposed to the repeal of the Credit Control Act. While mandatory controls t~n4 to create as many problems as they oolve, the availa.b111ty of the authoi:ity in times of economic emergency may be all that stands betw~en stab111ty and widespread dislocation in the' snort term. Since the au\u00ad thority under the Credit Control Act must specifically be granted by the President for anti-inflation purposes and for a limited duration, it is better to have the authority in place for use in emergency circumstances than to have to request it when needed. In today's volatile economic climate, it is essen\u00ad tial that legitimate economic options not be foreclosed. \u00b7Therefore, the Department of the Treasury opposes the repeal of the Credit Control Act. The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there is no objection from the standpoint of the Administration 's program to the submission of this report to your Committee. Sincerely yours, HENRY C. 8TOCKELL, Jr., Deputy General Counsel.e NOTICES OF HEARINGS HEARING ON THE NOMINATION OF JOHN WHITE TO BE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET e Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, the Committee on Governmental Affairs will hold hearings on Friday, March 30 on the nomination of John P. White to be Deputy Director of the Office of Manage\u00ad ment and Budget. The hearing will be held at 10: 30 a.m. in room 3302 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. SUBCOMMITTEE ON RURAL DEVELOPMENT Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on April 2, 1979, beginning at 1 p.m. in room 324, Russell, the Subcommittee on Rural De\u00ad velopment will hold the first in a new series of oversight hearings to focus on the current state of achieving goals and implementing programs to improve the lives of our rural citizens. This first hearing will provide a com\u00ad prehensive review of where the Farmers Home Administration has been; what is being done to rectify problems brought out in past hearings; and what the De\u00ad partment views as the future of the agency. Additionally, the subcommittee will be interested in hearing from Assistant Sec\u00ad retary Mercure on how the Department of Agriculture is working with both the White House and other agencies and de\u00ad partments in developing a coordinated rural policy. Since I recently introduced the Rural Development Policy and Coordination Act of 1979, the Assistant Secretary will also be commenting on that legislation. Assistant Secretary Mercure will be the only witness at this hearing; how\u00ad ever, additional Government and public witnesses will take part in our future hearings. AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE , SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transporta\u00ad tion be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate today beginning at 1: 30 p.m. to hold an oversight hear\u00ad ing on motor carrier regulation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Foreign Relations be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on Thursday, March 29, 1979, beginning at 3 p.m. to hold an executive session for a briefing by CIA, ACDA, and DOD of\u00ad ficials on the impending SALT treaty. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS THE MEDIA Mr. TOWER. Mr. President, we are all very much aware of the media in this country, with varying opinions of its power and influence. It is often that more such power is attributed than is due. However, there are examples of the media's ability to influence the perception of reality, enough examples, in fact, to raise the very real question of how widespread the practice may have become. An outstanding discussion of this issue is contained in an address pre\u00ad sented recently by Mr. Maurice Rosen\u00ad blatt of Washington, D.C. although I do not agree in every specific with Mr. Rosenblatt in his dissertation, it cer\u00ad tainly contains many valid and thought\u00ad ful observations. I commend it to the Congress, the public, and the mass media. Mr. President, I ask that the text of Mr. Rosenblatt's remarks before the St. Regis Conference in Luxembourg in February of this year, be printed in the RECORD. The material follows: THE FABRICATION OF REALITY: MEDIA IN AMERICA TODAY THE FIRST ESTATE Today's America, its mind, economy and politics, is dominated by the media, both print and electronic. We should examine the vital statistics concerning the power, wealth and privileges of media in the United States. Measured in these terms, one suddenly discovers that the Fourth Estate has become the First Estate. To some of its critics it exhibits the characteristics of the Bourbon autocracy. The press, and that has come to include broadcasting , has, by court precedents and constant usage, succeeded ln winning im\u00ad munities and dispensation that are denied other enterprises. The cornerstone of this exceptional status is the First Amendment to the Constitution: \"Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press . . . \". Originally this was applied only to Federal law, but in a series of milestone decisions the immunity of the press has been extended to cover the states, so tha.t the press m.a.y not be curbed by local or state statutes either. Also, the press enjoys special treatment in other ways: there are reduced postal rates for mailing news\u00ad papers a.nd magazines; copyright la.ws shield the press from the piracy of its product; the normal prohibitions against monopoly March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL R)3CORD- SENATE 6579 a1\u00b7e strained and bent so that thE: press has latitudes not allowed to other bus.iness. Over the years, these considerations have given the press economic advantages of enormous value. When Ben Bagdikian, the distinguished newspaper critic, examined the average prof\u00ad its of newspapers he found them to be 76 percent higher than those of all other Ameri\u00ad can industries. Max Kampelman, a Washing\u00ad ton lawyer and Humphrey confidante, in his monograph \"The Power of the Press: A Prob\u00ad lem for Our Democracy\", wrote that \"The press is not only an institution designed to provide the principal means of communica\u00ad tion and the exchange of ideas in our body politic, but (unlike almost all universities, for example) it is also an institution of busi\u00ad ness and profit for those who own news\u00ad papers and TV stations. In terms of employ\u00ad ment, the newspaper industry today is Amer\u00ad ica's third largest manufacturer, behind automobiles and steel.\" Historically, the awesome power of the press had been limited by competition. Newspaper readers had access to other news\u00ad papers which were competitors and rivals so that editorial comment and news reports could be compared, verified and validated. In other words, there was a free market of ideas and information, which gave readers the op\u00ad portunity to do some comparison shopping for the truth. Such an option disappears when monopoly takes over. This problem of monopoly is a real one. The decline of independent ownership of daily newspapers in the United States has changed the economic and editorial character of the press. New York City, in 1920, had 15 daily newspapers; in 1963 there were stlll 12; today there are three. Across the country in 1910 there were 2,202 dally papers, all but 62 independently owned. By 1977 the total num\u00ad ber had dropped to 1,762 of which 1,047 were owned by groups. In terms of circulation, today's groups have 71 percent of weekday and 78 percent of Sunday sales. The large chains are now buying up smaller chains. Newhouse now own the Booth group and Gannett owns both Spiedel and Combined Communications broadcasting outlets. Many of the larger groups own valuable subsid\u00ad iaries, such as publishing houses, timber plantations, magazines, radio, TV and cable systems. The following chart from Editor and Pub\u00ad lisher International Year Book, 1977 edition, shows the growing concentration of owner\u00ad ship and identifies the dominant conglomer\u00ad ates. (Note the circulation decline from 1970 to 1977, attributed to the shift to television.) More recent reports indicate TV viewing may have peaked, with print readership stabi\u00ad lizing. A valid projection indicates that within two decades, virtually all of America's dally newspapers will be owned by fewer than two dozen communication conglomerates. The one-newspaper town has become the rule: today there are fewer than 45 cities with two or more competing dallies; in 1,500 cities a single newspaper holds sway.

It is unorthodox in its fidelity to classic journalistic traditions, and unique, because it has emerged as America's only national newspaper. Its singularity of\u00ad fers a counterpoint to other publications, a standard against which to measure the mass product of flack journalism that engulfs the national scene. People read the Journal whereas they scan other newspapers. It is thoughtful, non-dog\u00ad matic and non-ideological, despite its con\u00ad E\"ervative heritage and editorial policy. In contrast to the majority of other newspapers whose non-advertising copy (local, wire and syndicate) is over 80% public relations material or purely the output of the news source itself, the columns of the Journal are the result of the paper's own initiative and creativity. We talked with Norman Miller, the Journal's bureau chief in Washington . Here is a summary of the discussion . How is production different from that of other papers? The Journal is published five mornings a week. Its 1.6 million circulation makes it the second largest American daily, only slightly behind the New York Daily News tabloid. The newsstand price is 30 cents, at least twice the average price of other papers. The Journal is distributed from 12 cities across the country. The editorial and news content is prepared in New York. Mechanical production was transferred to Springfield, Massachusetts, to escape New York's turbu\u00ad lent union problems. From Springfield, it ls transmitted electronically to Brunswick, New Jersey; Washington, D.C.; Orlando, Florida; Dallas, Texas; Los Aneeles and San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; Highland Park, Illinois (near Chicago); and Cleveland, Ohio. The various editions appear simultane\u00ad ously, with advertising localized to suit each region. How does its appeal differ? The Journal is a second newspaper for most of its readers, who read at least one other paper from local news. In the Journal they find a reliable, comprehensive report on business and eco\u00ad nomics, broadly defined. Business is not only interested in its own affairs but in general conditions, government regulation, civil rights, federal-state relations, health, person\u00ad nel and job trends, and public taste. The news is capsulized on the front page with fuller treatment inside when necessary. Most of the front page articles are really magazine articles, written on the assumption that the readers are serious, not escapist and not looking for entertainment. Reporters are given time, sometimes weeks, to develop their stories in depth, since the objective is analy\u00ad sis and understanding. This is not to s~y the writing is dry or lacking in human interest. The reader will find a daily front page fea\u00ad ture story on a personality, a community movement, a religious cult or a new mouse trap; but it must be significant as well as novel. The Journal does not repeat what readers have already learned from their local or broadcast news. Disasters, scandals, celeb\u00ad rity gossip, and violent incidents are not covered. How do\u00b7es readership differ? Most U.S. dailles are ravenous for circulation. They employ pollsters to identify ways to boost it even more. Surveys proclaim that the paper must stress sports, comic strips, letters\u00ad to-the-editor, neighborhood trivia, gossip, sex and violence; contests and bountws are popular. \u00b7 Hunger for readership, the basis for lucrative advertising, transfers the con\u00ad trol of content and taste from the objective journalist to the huckster-promoter. Sensa\u00ad tionalism and vulgarity mark the final product. In contrast, the Journal does not seek to increase its readership at the expense of quality. It caters to well educated readers in business and labor who are seriously inter\u00ad ested in public affairs and have a sense of continuity. Editions are limited to 48 pages. There is something to this spareness, at a. time when other papers are growing heavier in an attempt to satisfy highly diversified audiences. How well has this approach worked? The Wall Street Journal has found, or has created a national market; its circulation figures prove this. CCYpf,es 1940'8 -------------------------- 100,000 1960's ------------~------------- 600,000 1978 --------------------------- 1,600,000 How is the Journal managed and who owns it? The Journal is owned by Dow 6580 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENA TE March 28, 1979 Jones, which also owns the new service, Bar\u00ad rons Magazine, a chain of small newspapers, the Monthly Book Digest, and some Asian economic services. All elements are in the information business, \"repackaging\" in\u00ad formation, mainly through the overseas Dow Jones-AP ticket. It is a diversified news organization, with 90 % of income derived from the Journal. It ls noteworthy that the president of Dow Jones is chosen from the news gathering side of the business. The Journal does not at present have broadcast afllllates. It has been reluctant to acquire them because of the accompanying govern\u00ad ment regulation, though some involvement ls being considered. How do you feel about advocacy journal\u00ad ism? M1ller replied, \"Journalism is the proc\u00ad ess of imposing order on events that are chaotic, resulting in their coherent presenta\u00ad tion. We aren't tied to yesterday; we seek an amalgam of insights. There is no law that requires that you print everything. We are committed to the test that events be slgnitl\u00ad cant. We avoid being soothsayers and ex\u00ad cathedra judgments. We try to give informa\u00ad tion as fully as possible and let the readers make up their own minds.\" How to keep the press honest? Mlller, Uke most sophisticated students of the media, recognizes that there 1s no simple, iron\u00ad clad procedure to insure that the whole truth and nothing but the truth will be printed, but agrees that there are certain steps that can be taken to insure a rellable press. There are newspapers in the United States that turn their backs on responsible journal\u00ad ism. In New Hampshire, Ohio, Indiana, and Arizona we know certain pubUcatlons steeped in bias. But we must recognize that the cred1b111ty of the press is constantly being reviewed, and tested by events; it is an em\u00ad pirical process. One of the main safeguards for the in\u00ad tegrity of the press, is for owners to avoid conflicts of interest such as develop from being engaged in non-related business enter\u00ad prises. The press has a. privileged position, and with it go obllga.tions. The Journal rotates reporters, to a.void the kind of cozy relationships that develop from covering the same beat for years, though, admittedly, this is a. mechanical gesture. A more useful change ma.y be to tighten the Ubel laws. Presently, it 1s very difficult for a. citizen to make a. case against the press. To correct the other faults of the press, mentioned elsewhere in this paper, such as the blotting out of certain persons and stories, and \"handicapping\" candidate~. we cannot rely on laws and formal codes. We must look toward rigorous training for re\u00ad porters and editors, stressing responslbUlty to their craft and to society. We must rely on the ethics of the journalist, who, if he ls conscientious, seeks the esteem of his peers within the profession. To keep the press free under the First Amendment, and stm insure its quality and veracity, self-discipllne remains the best safeguard. BROADCASTING Never have so few controlled so many with so little. Contemporary American Ufe 1s more dominated by the media, particularly television, than any society in human his\u00ad tory. Walter Lippmann wrote of this awesome power: \"The news of the day as it reaches the newspaper office is an incredible medly of facts, propaganda., rumor, suspicion, clues, hopes and fears .... The power to determine ea.ch day what shall seem important and what shall be neglected 1s a power unlike any that has been exercised since the Pope lost his hold on the secular mind.\" That was written sixty years ago, before the saturation of people's lives by broad\u00ad casting. Today 98 percent of American house\u00ad holds have at least one television. The aver\u00ad age viewing time 1s 6 to 7 hours per day. So what we have is a society whose awareness of events, whose sense of reality through sight and sound, is conditioned by a selec\u00ad tive interpretation of the universe. All stimuli a.re filtered through the prism of the media. In the United States mass communica\u00ad tions, broadcasting and press, are business for profit, protected under the First Amend\u00ad ment. Radio and television a.re licensed by the Federal Communications Commission. They pay no rental for the airwaves on which they hold a. monopoly. They are supported by advertisers who pay varying fees, depend\u00ad ing on the time of the broadcast and the popularity of the program. The most lucra\u00ad tive advertising sells beer, cosmetics, cars, patent medicines and similar consumer prod\u00ad ucts. Advertising rates range from a. few dol\u00ad lars for a. couple of minutes on a small radio station to $120,000 for a 30-second TV spot month. Sta\u00ad tions a.re require.d to percent of opera.ting time for \"public service announce\u00ad ments.\" A new frontier has been opened in the ether over America.. There is a parallel be\u00ad tween the way air rights a.re distributed today and the way public lands were pa.r\u00ad eeled out in the West. In the 19th Century, the railroads, through political influence, secured rights-of-way and township sites, all of which produced high speculative profits on practically no investment; thus the fortunes of Vanderbilt, Gould, HUI and Ryan were accumulated. The diversion of public a.tr space to private exploitSltion has produced a. slmllar disregard for the community's interests. Today's broad\u00ad casting buccaneers pose as proprietors of the airwaves and not as licensees entrusted with a public resource. An example of this pre\u00ad sumption has been their cavalier attitude toward providing time for election cam\u00ad paigns. The escalating cost of campaigning, the biggest bite being for air time, has be\u00ad come the central problem and a. threat to honest elections. When it was audaciously proposed that free media. time be allocated among contending candidates, the broad\u00ad casters walled that this would reduce prime time revenue. Reminders that the airwaves, the equiva\u00ad lent of the Greek a.gora or Roman forum, should be reserved for the transaction of pub\u00ad lic business, met with the ir.dustry's fury. Congressmen were pressed by friendly sta\u00ad tions from home dlstricts--also many held partnerships in local radio/TV enterprises\u00ad so the proposal was killed. As a sop a. b111 was passed that provided that candidate-time can no longer be priced higher than regular com\u00ad mercial rates. Another consolation was con\u00ad sldqred, to offer campaigners cheap time in slack periods. Perhaps, someone suggested, the Athenians should have held Socrates' trial at three in the morning so as not to disturb the olive vendors, feather merchants, fish mongers and other traders who were per\u00ad mitted in the agora during the day. In the 1978 campaign each of the 68 Sen - ate candidates spent an average of more than $900,000. In some campaigns the figure climbed to $2 milllon. About % went to pay broadcasters for the use of air time. In January 1979, there were 999 television stations operating, 725 commercial and 274 non-commercial; in radio there were a total of 8,888 licensed operators, of which 7,811 were commercial and 1,055 were non-com\u00ad mercial. When it comes to the number of persons equipped to receive broadcasting, there is an overwhelming disparity between the United States and the rest of the world. In 1976, the total number of television sets worldwide was 364 m1111on, or 108 per thousand people. North America had 506 sets per thousand and Africa had 1.3 sets per thousand. The aver\u00ad age for developed countries was 200 per thou\u00ad sand and for underdeveloped countries ran 15 per thousand. The total number of radio sets worldwide was 881 million, or 288 per thousand. Again, North America had the highest percentage with 1,667 sets per thousand-almost two per person. Noteworthy ls the strong showing of the USSR in radios, with 441 sets per thou\u00ad sand compared with 313 for the rest of Europe; Latin America. had 170; Asia and the Arab states both had 110 and Africa. ha.d 42 per thousand people. The same disparity exists in telephones, where the U.S. ho.s 64 telephones per 100 peo\u00ad ple (1975) while Brazll has 3.3, Argentina 8 and Spa.in 19 per hundred people. When it comes to electronic media. and telecommunications, the U.S. is in another century, virtually light years ahead of the rest of the planet. \u00b7 So much for quantity. When it comes to quality of content, the imbalance may be somewhat rectified . In the United States broadcasting is directed at entertainment and advertising. The \"bottom line\", not taste or truth, governs programming. Many Amer\u00ad icans look to British broadcasting as supe\u00ad rior, both in entertainment and news. Anthony Smith, the British media expert, went to the heart of the problem of Amer\u00ad ican television when he noted that the as\u00ad sumption that the public has the right to be informed was converted by television into the notion that the public has the right to be entertained. In his essay on The Politics of Information, he writes that it ls \"in the na\u00ad ture of the medium that all programs must be directed at a medium audience, hour by hour. The program-maker, in the very process by which he is professionalized and trained, ls made to believe that his audience must be 'held', that it must be 'grab.bed', that it must be addressed within an area of common allu\u00ad sion created by the medium of television itself. The program maker, the audience and the medium are assumed to be locked to\u00ad gether within the same plane of meaning; all other meaning ls excluded as lying out\u00ad side the nexus.\" PUBLIC BROADCASTING IN THE UNITED STATES There a.re three commercial networks: ABC, CBS and NBC, and then there is a public broadcasting network that services 280 non\u00ad commercial stations via satellite. They offer entirely different programs, featuring educa\u00ad tional materials, news and entertainment un\u00ad interrupted bv commercials-the bane of television continuity. These public outlets are owned by communities. universities, sohool districts and states. More than 40% of all American famllles now watch public TV at least once a week. The budget for pub\u00ad lic broadcasting, $347 mill1on. comes from the federal government, foundations, corpo\u00ad rations and volunteer contributions. The Carnegie Commission on the Future of Publk Broadcasting recently recommended that $1 billion be made available for non\u00ad <:ommercial \u00b7broadcasting. The new money would come from a fee charged commercial broadcasters for thelr use of the airwaves plus a. susbtantial federal government con\u00ad tribution. This proposal comes at a time when Pres\u00ad ident Carter has also suggested more federal funding \" ... to create high quality domes\u00ad tic productions . . . public broadcasting can provide complete coverage of news events such as important Congressional hearings, that commerdal broadcasting rarely offers.\" March 28, 1979 C:ONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 6581 THE MYTH MAKERS \"The news is what I say it is.\"-NBC's David Brinkley. The media's power to in\u00ad vent and eclipse public figures, particularly in the political theater, is awesome to the point of being sinister. There appears to be a self-orchestration among the press, the instinct of the pack, shared by most journal\u00ad ists. It is based not upon any unanimity of perception of what is going on but rather upon shared insecurity that makes them look to. each other, reinforcing their waver\u00ad ing vision by closely reading yesterday's headlines. One day they are tame and in\u00ad gratiating a.s they fawn for a.ny newsy tid\u00ad bit from the public figures whom they them\u00ad selves have contrived. The next day they are wolves, bent on savaging the same per\u00ad son. They have been described as black\u00ad birds on a telephone line; when one flies off they all fiy off, and when one files back they all fiy back, as if on cue. THE PRESS FALLS FOR ITS OWN VXLLAIN\u00ad JOE M'CARTHY Joe McCarthy, the demagogic Wisconsin Senator was a creature almost entirely out of whole cloth woven on the looms of type\u00ad writers. His rise can be attributed largely to the gullib111ty of the press who covered him with fulsome fascination as no Senator has ever been covered, before or since. Mccarthy rose on the twin myths of conspiracy and 1nvincib111ty. The press did much to inflate both. The conspiracy myth was sustained by the anxieties of the Cold War. McCarthy had absolutely no shred of evidence to support his wild charges that 210 Communists had infiltrated the State Department, that President Truman was in league with Canadian atomic spies, that the Pentagon was \"soft on Reds\", et cetera. He ran a press circus with himself as ring\u00ad master. He shrewdly exploited the illusion of power, converting it into real power as the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Army catered to his whim. Even Dwight Eisenhower allowed himself to be boxed in, and cravenly refused to counter McCarthy's charge of \"treason\" against General George Marshall. As to his political potency, McCarthy was credited with the election of 10 Senators of his ilk and the defeat of 10 who had resisted him. This fable of omnipotence exploded upon examination but the press failed to examine it. Actually, candidates who ran with McCarthy's blessing were often de\u00ad feated, and those whom he was credited with defeating, Tydings, Lucas, Benton, and others, either won at the time of McCarthy's attacks or were brought down by factors totally unconnected with his efforts. Sober examination showed that both the man and his \"ism\" profited from an Alice in Wonder\u00ad land multiplication, through the mirrors of the press. The press was in a real dilemma.. They had helped create him and now the geni was out of the bottle, the noisiest voice in the land, a direct or subjective force in\u00ad volved in every political decision. Most newspapers denounced him editorially, while the Chica.go Tribune and its satellites, the Hearst Press and the newspapers of similar stripe extolled him. For the established liberal press, McCarthy cast a. lurid spell. They could not leave him a.Ione, over-reporting him with horror, prompting the coining of the term \"foebo\u00ad phile\"-those who are morbidly fascinated by their enemies. The central lesson of the McCarthy experi\u00ad ence is the importance of conceptualizing reality. Here was the cardinal principle, the key to unlocking the mystery of McCarthy's rise and fall. His press image was that of a. reactionary bent on destroying liberals. It was necessary to correct this image, which required an un\u00ad orthodox rhetoric. A new term was invented a rubric now part of the political lexicon, \"radical right\". In the new dialectic, befouler of West Point, a vandal subverting his own Republican Party, a slanderer of the bankers and financiers of Wall Street, a wrecker bent on bringing down the temple of the establishment. Finally, he was pitted against the Senate itself, making his attack on that institution the crime which resulted in his condemnation, not by the liberals but by the establishment. He was a reckless hooligan who violated the truth twice a day on time for the after\u00ad noon and morning editions of the press. It was fascinating to observe that when the press ignored McCarthy he became sullen and morose. They had contrived him and when there ceased to be a fantasy figure, the real flesh and blood man crumbled. He had identified himself with his image and when the image died, he died. If there was one other casualty it was the print media, led by the Associated Press. T'ne televising of the Army-McCarthy hearings gave the public a first hand, and entirely dif\u00ad ferent view of this man whom they read about as the Sir Lancelot of Americanism. People saw him as a bully boy, snarling and mephistic, the prototype of the \"bad guy\" of TV westerns. More important, wire edi\u00ad tors of newspapers all over the country saw that this was no one-sided contest; they saw witnesses stand their ground, they heard ra\u00ad tional voices discrediting the Senator's lies. McCarthy was dismayed when pressed with hard evidence; he looked like a fool as well as a villa.in. Newspapers in the hinterland de\u00ad manded more balanced reporting, and from that point the press had to modify their lopsided coverage and deal with a public whose opinion had been formed by another medium. On this occasion, at least, the press had to halt stampeding opinion, that had been made possible by a lack of competition. mAN, THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES On January 16th the Washington Post car\u00ad ried an editorial \"Who is Khomeini?\" raising more important questions than the identity of the exiled lraniwn religious leader. The editorial was marked by n.9.ive astonish\u00ad ment, .as if an O'bscure apparition had sud\u00ad denly pulled the Persian rug from under the Emperor. The real question is where has the American press 'been for the past 25 yea.rs, during iwhich time adulatory pre\u00ad sented the Shah as ia.n enlightened, progres\u00ad sive reformer striving to drag a backward Iran into the modern technological age. Americ.an coverage of Iran stands as a prime example o.f media myopia, sloth and incom\u00ad petence eJ.ded and official policy ma.kers. Why was the press ta.ken by surprise by the current strife? Instead of investigation and analysis, the press took its cue from the State Department-CIA propaga,nda mill ;which proved to be an unreliable source because as the Post notes, \"to avoid offending the Shah, Americ.an officials long accepted the demand to sihun contact with all opposition ele\u00ad ments.\" According to the Post, the insulaition of Americans on the issue was so complete that \"until just the other day the CIA could not even Ui.y its hands on some of Mr. Kho\u00ad meini's vol uminous--.a.nd revealing--writ- 1ngs. It is hard to imagine a more painful in\u00ad stance of willful self-blinding.\" More perva\u00ad sive a.nd possibly more ds.ma.ging were the assumptions formulated ,by policymakers and propagated by the press, such as: T!he Iranian military represents a bulwark against the Soviets; 'I1he Shah's reforms were transforming the feudal Society into a stable modern country; The financial transactions (in m111tary hardware and oil) are meaningful to the Iranian masses; Having Iran as a friend would somehow stabilize the Mideast situation; and The Shalh. had correctly chariaoterized his opposition .as \"Islamic Marxists.\" Who else would resist such a popular, beneficelllt ruler? One need only sUlbstitute the names of other countries and other puppets to see this pattern repeated iaround the world; in Viet\u00ad nam, Korea, Chile, Nicaragua, wherever the United States security agencies have in\u00ad jected themselves to manipulate foreign pol\u00ad icy and public opinion. This approach, ending in upheaval and collapse, has generally been abetted by a long misrepresentation or obscuring of the facts by the American press. The media have taken their cue from the official insiders who then tend to believe their own prop~ aganda. One cannot tell which oomes first the ostrich or the egg. In the case of Iran: competent observers have never believed there was any serious possibility of stopping or even slowing down a Soviet aggression. As to the validity of the Shah's \"reforms\", there was a complete misreading of the social and political realities, that resulted in a super\u00ad ficial optimism, ignoring the volcano under\u00ad neath. Reporters missed the boat. They failed to understand the opposition to the Shah's modernization plan because of their overall failure to explain what is going on in Iran. According to the Columbia Journalism Re\u00ad view's current study (Reporting Iran Through the Shah's Eyes), \"This failure to comprehend why reasonable people who are neither religious zealots nor Marxists might object to the Shah's brand of modernization has, in turn, been caused by the reporters' cultural nearsightedness and ideological estrangement from the values of Iran society.\" The journalists' lack of depth made them repeat incantations about \"land reforms.\" Had they dug beneath official rhetoric they would have discovered that the Shah was engaged in a ploy to widen his political base by diminishing the influence of large land\u00ad holders, the Shah's once and future political rivals. About 10 percent of the peasants benefitted from the redistribution and roughly ten million more were left with less acreage than is required for family sub\u00ad sistence. A forced migration to the cities caused a drastic reduction in agricultural production, so Iran must now import 50 per\u00ad cent of its staples because of the chaos that ensued. Likewise, the press is only beginning to realize that the anti-Government demon\u00ad strators are not merely religious fanatics with Marxist overtones. The complaint is not so much with modernization as it is against corruption, ostentation, autocracv and the imposition of Western notions and practices. It is no wonder that coverage and policy collapsed under the weight of false assump\u00ad tions, ethnocentrism and naivete. The press, by accepting the official line and apparently believing it, did the public a great disservice. Jn the words of Richard A. Falk, the Prince\u00ad ton international law professor: \"the media . . . has denied the legit\u00ad imacy in American eyes, thereby truncating oublic debate on one of the most important foreiErn policy developments since the end of U.S. involvement in Indochina. Unless the press 'helns open up debate, the American pnblic will be making up its mind under much the same conditions that prevailed during the Vietnam War.\" The list of distortions is inherent in the 6582 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENA TE March 28, 1979 press methodology in case after case, given the basic cohesiveness of the entire informa\u00ad tion apparatus. America. has just received. the full treatment again in coverage of the visit of Teng Hsia.o-p'ing. Overnight the Red Chi\u00ad nese devil has been given a. complete face\u00ad lift and presented uncritically, with thou\u00ad sands of words and hours of television depicting him as a benign, witty, engaging personality, America's friend and ally. Scant coverage was given to the thousands of pro\u00ad testers who clogged the streets of Washing\u00ad ton or to the concern by members of Con\u00ad gress who urged some reserve and caution before we lose our ha.la.nee a.gain. NOMINATION BY THE PRESS The media. have now ta.ken over in candi\u00ad date selection. It ls in the primaries that press interpretations have been found to su\u00ad persede the actual expression by the voters, and it is the media's imposed judgment that often settles the outcome. Professor M. J. Robinson, in his study \"TV's Newest Pro\u00ad gram: The Presidential Nomination Ga.me\" formulates what he terms the \"dismal\" theory that \"the key to winning the nomina\u00ad tion is merely to be declared the winner by the networks in the New Hampshire pri\u00ad mary.\" It is often forgotten that President Johnson received a. majority of the New Hampshire votes In the 1968 primary, but Sena.tor Eugene McCarthy, with 42 percent was \"declared\" the real winner by the press. A few weeks later in the Wisconsin primary, McCarthy garnered 56 percent of the votes against the Johnson slate, but now he was \"declared\" to have \"lost\" because he had failed to reach 60 percent, the magic level arbitrarily set by the press. An even greater distortion comes from the amount of coverage given. Robinson points out that prior to the 1976 New Hampshire primary, U states had held caucuses that accounted for 587 delegates compared to New Hampshire's 38. Yet the news stories on those 11 states represented less than 10 percent of network political coverage compared to 23 percent for New Hampshire alone. A New Hampshire delegate received 80 times the coverage as those from the earlier states. Most people ca.me to know only one of the candidates, the New Hampshire \"winner\", Jimmy Carter. Public recognition of Carter quadrupled. The influence of the media raised Carter from obscurity to the position of declared. \"frontrunner\". Yet Carter re\u00ad ceived only 30 percent of the New Hampshire vote while 70 percent voted for other candi\u00ad dates; but according to Walter Cronkite the results \"gave Carter a commanding head start\" and CBS's Roger Mudd declared that \"Oarter's victory was suf>stantiail\". NBC hailed him as the \"unqualified winner\". All this built to the ultimate ap theosls of politics, cover stories on Time and News\u00ad week. By actual count, Carter received 2,630 lines of coverage in these magazines while all of Carter's opponents received only 300 lines. The week after New Hampshire, the Georgian received three times the television and four times the front page coverage as all his rivals together. The New Yorlt Times pointed. out that reporters did not like Senator Henry Jackson and that television therefore dismissed his substantial victories as \"special cases.\" In Massachusetts, Carter's 23,000 votes merited respectful talk about his momentum while Jackson's 163,000 votes elicited little more than a shrug. When Jack\u00ad son went on to win New York, Roger Mudd said this was because of \"New York pecu\u00ad liarities\" and Leslie Stahl (CBS) declared that his victory did not give him momentum. A study by Professor Thomas Patterson showed that \"Carter simply dominated elec\u00ad tion reporting. The coverage became more lopsided with each primary until, Professor Patterson found, \"Carter was receiving five times as much exposure as his major rivals.\" By the time of the De~o .cratlc convention Carter had only to harvest the victory so uncritically planted by th~ media. The 1976 presidential election saw the low ebb of the print medi~ as tr.1-qmpha.nt tele\u00ad vision took over the political arena.. TV was the name of the game; coverage b,Y the news\u00ad papers was reduced to reviewing the candi\u00ad dates' performance on the rival medium. The Ford-Carter debates were llve if not lively, and the scribes sat on the sidelines with the rest of the public. They had become voyeurs, much as the sportscasters keep up a running comment while the actual game 1.s played for all to see. The written press, long one of the most lnfiuentia.l factors in the American poli\u00ad tical process, has lost out to a. new technol\u00ad ogy that both overwhelms and numbs the public. The media power to influence the selection process determines the type of candidate who enters politics today, based upon tele\u00ad vision appeal. What matter if a. candidate ls knowledgeable about economics, ls a fine lawyer or sklllful parlla.menta.rian? The ques\u00ad tion is, how does he come across on the tube; is the smile engaging, is he smart on \"talk shows\", does he have an effective television image? Forget the depth of his mind, how deep are his dimples? Suddenly we have a crop of candidates who are actors, astro\u00ad nauts, and athletes. Instead of political par\u00ad ties we have groupies. American polltlcs has become show business. LITERACY OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC In \u00b7his Nobel Prize lecture, Aleksandr Sol\u00ad zhenitsyn declared that a nation that loses its memory loses its spiritual unity. One of the most disturbing characteristics of post-World War Il Americans, those too young to remember the war, ls their abysmal ignorance of the past. A whole generation of Americans view history as divided. into B.W. and A.W.: Before Walter Cl'onkite and After Walter. For this generation, the War means the Vietnam War. Their knowledge of the Twentieth Century, the two world wars, the Great Depression, the New Deal, ts practically nonexistent. When network television showed \"The Holocaust\" la.st year, the reaction of many Amerioans was one of bewilderment rather than disbelief. They could not under\u00ad stand how such an event could have hap\u00ad pened in our time. Yes, they had heard vague rumors, but it remained a myth until a tele\u00ad vision fiction authenticated it. Another anecdote: recently a young friend of mine remarked that she wanted to read \"War and Remembrance,\" Herman Wouk's new novel about the Second World War. She understood that it contained a superb de\u00ad scription of the Battle of Midway. To this, one of her contemporaries replied, \"What's Midway?\" A third member of the group said, in horror, \"Do you mean to say you've never watched any John Wayne war movies on TV?\" Recent polls have shown that two-thirds of the American people now gett most of their news from television. The percentage among young viewers ls even higher. In an inter\u00ad view conducted in 1974, Av Westin, executive producer of ABC evening news, frankly con\u00ad ceded the shortcomings of TV news. He said: \"I know what we have to leave out; if people do not read newspapers, news magazines and books they are desperately uninformed.\" Not only are Amerloans today uninformed; mUllons of them have managed to pass through our secondary and higher education institutions and emerge as functional llliter\u00ad ates. The 1nab111ty to read and write bask English 1s one of the great scandals of mod\u00ad ern Amerioan education. Consider the follow\u00ad ing: \"Some 12 mlllion American adults 14 years of age and older cannot read as well as the average fourth-grader, yet seventh-grade reading ab111ty ls required to perform such skilled or semi-skilled jobs as machinist or cook. An estimated 18 million adults cannot read well enough to file applications for Med\u00ad icaid, Social Security, bank loans, or drivers' licenses.\" (American Education, May 1974) The majority of Americans of all ages tend to use only the simplest sentence structure and the most elementary vocabulary when they write. The writing performance of teen\u00ad agers seems to be deteriorating at the most alarming rate of all. Essays of 13-and 17- year olds tested in 1975 were far more awk\u00ad ward, incoherent and disorganized. than those of the same age group tested ln 1969. Why the decline? Educators differ on the reasons, citing poor famlly environment, lack of discipline, faulty teaching, inadequate fa\u00ad cilities. Most agree, however, that time spent watching television is time not spent practic\u00ad ing reading and writing. U.S. Commissioner of Education Ernest L. Boyer remarked last April that \"Young children-two to five yea.rs old-now watch television over four hours every day, nearly 30 hours a week. . . . By the time a youngster enters first grade he or she has had 6,000 hours of television view\u00ad ing. . . .\" By the time American students graduate from high oohool they have spent 50 percent more time watching TV than they've spent in school. Some sources esti\u00ad mate that, at the present rate, Americans will end their lives having spent more time watch\u00ad ing television than doing anything else ex\u00ad cept sleeping. So what ls so wrong with so many hours spent in front of the tube? What ls so wrong is that watching television ts entirely a pas\u00ad sive exercise. Television demands nothing of .the imagination. Unlike the reader, the TV viewer ls not forced to deal with abstractions and complexities, to follow another's train of thought, to visualize characters and situa\u00ad tions for himself. Although television in\u00ad forms, it does not demand that the viewer take an active part in learning. It diminishes and atrophies the critical faculties. And be\u00ad cause it ls so desperately anxious never to bore (thereby losing Its audience and pre\u00ad cious advertising revenue), it ls forced to present subjects in as sprightly and super\u00ad ficial \u00b7a fashion as possible. The moguls of American commercial television cater to a very brief attention span. Recently, for ex\u00ad ample, one of the major networks, ABC, changed the format of its evening news pro\u00ad gram to include, as the news is being broad\u00ad cast, captions for upcoming stories. The im\u00ad plication is that, lf you don't like what you're seeing now, just wait. You'll be seeing some\u00ad thing entirely different 30 seconds from now. The new scheme does wonders for the con\u00ad centration. What is also so wrong with so much TV is that it may influence some antisocial indi\u00ad viduals, particularly among the young, to violent behavior. Since the early fifties. when television became part of everyday life in America, there has been a noticeable increase in juvenile crime and street viola.nee. It has been over 20 years since the United States Senate first held hearings to investigate the effects of media violence on children and youth. Congressional hearings on the same subject have been held many times since. What is so dangerous a.bout so much tele\u00ad vision ls that we have allowed 1t to take over as the chief means of communication. c. P. Snow (Lord Snow), in a speech at the Na\u00ad tional Book Awards in 1977, put it this way: \"The spread of TV ls the greatest revolu\u00ad tion in human interchange since the inven\u00ad tion of printing. Far more than radio, since most people, though not all, are more deeply atrected by what they hear, and most of all by what they see-and-hear ... Sometimes it seems that the range of stimuli which hit us takes away from any desire to think. March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE 6583 Thinking has gone out of fashion ... We can become punch-drunk with mindless pic\u00ad tures and mindless sound. We needn't re\u00ad member anything. \"The week is a long time in politics, said one of our recent Prime Ministers. The week ls a long time in today's culture. The printed word-including those obsolescent objects, books-is the collective memory of the hu\u00ad man race. Books don't fade with last night's memory. Maybe that is why they are ceas\u00ad ing to be read.\" That is the pessimistic view, perhaps too pessimistic. There is a brighter side to this story. The American television industry was dismayed a.bout six months a.go. when its surveys told it that viewing time among the prime market 18-to 34-yea.r-olds was ac\u00ad tually on the decline. At first, naturally, the networks blamed the survey methodology rather than themselves. A decline in tele\u00ad vision viewing. Heresy. Better to kill the messenger than heed the sad tidings. Reasons !or the decline in viewing a.re not yet clear. It probably has something to do with the fa.ct that so many American women a.re now working outside the home. That has meant fewer hours spent in daytime viewing as well as in the evening. Many working couples simply haven't the time to watch. It ts even conceivable that television bores them. It ls also true that the per ca.pita sale of books ts today three times what it was 25 yea.rs a.go. This figure comes from Dan Lacy. senior vice president of one of America's largest publishing conglomer\u00ad ates, McGra.w-H111, Inc. NEEDED: A COMMUNICATIONS MAGNA CARTA What the railroads were to the economic development of the United States in the 19th Century and the automobile was to the first half of the 20th Century, the communica\u00ad tion industry has become for the balance of this century, into the 21st. The problems that a.rise today concerning the press and broadcasting a.re not new in essence-they echo the eternal conflict be\u00ad tween liberty and license, freedom and au\u00ad thority-but they certainly are new in mag\u00ad nitude. The media. ls no longer the aloof ob\u00ad server chronicling the passing scene. It ls engaged as an active participant, making markets, picking candidates, arbitrating taste and morality, exaggerating or ignoring developments. It does all this while holding shares and partnerships; it controls or finds itself controlled by businesses unrelated to its communication purpose. No other in\u00ad dustry has access to so many varied levers of power. Perched on its rock of constitutional im\u00ad munity, to whom ls the press responsible and accountable? What if it exploits its freedom, rendering the news in a biased way, acting capriciously or viciously? When Stanley Baldwin was Prime Minister, he was the tar\u00ad get of two press magnates, Lord Rothermore and Lord Bea.verbrook, whose papers attacked him intemperately. Baldwin replied, \"What the proprietorship of these papers a.re aim\u00ad ing at ls power, and power without responsl\u00ad bllity-the prerogative of the harlot through\u00ad out the ages.\" When this question of press responsibllity is raised in America, we are offered unac\u00ad ceptable options, either a.bridge the Consti\u00ad tution's protections or risk the dangers of unbridled power and abuse. The rapid con\u00ad centration of newspaper ownership and the growth of communications conglomerates, compel that we immediately seek ways to escape this dilemma. Presently, committees of Congress are rewriting the Federal Com\u00ad munlca tions Act, a heroic task approached by politicians with timidity, since this ls a subject so compllca.ted and obscure to the public that only interested parties and their hired mercenaries bother to follow the in\u00ad tricacies. Unless a new communications Magna Carta ls drawn, we will be left at the mercy of the media's intentions, good or bad. The unacceptable answer, offered by the press. ls to leave the \u00b7matter completely to voluntarism, to the ethics and self-restraint of ~he media. The Wall ~treet Journal is cited as an example of responsible journal\u00ad tsm, where integrity ls respected. But there are also the horrible examples: the Man\u00ad chester, New Hampshire Union Leader, a paper steeped in bias, and once a Fierce Goldwater supporter, delivered an astonish\u00ad ing rebuke for Goldwater's criticism of Jimmy Hoffa, the head of the Tea.xnsters Union. It was later learned that the Teamsters had 2 million invested in the paper. Joseph Ken\u00ad nedy put $500,000 into the a111ng Boston Post at the time the paper switched its support to John Kennedy. Look at papers in Ohio, Indiana, Arizona for other examples of press bias and wanton distortion. In the present situation, the voluntary approach, trusting the good wm of the media, is not protection for the publlc, and it was the public, not the publisher that the First Amendment was intended to protect. Safe\u00ad guards can be drawn that wlll not do vio\u00ad lence to the First Amendment, that would provide for a reasonable balance in com\u00ad munications. Competition must be the un\u00ad derlying principle if there ts to be independ\u00ad ence and respons1b111ty at a time when tech\u00ad nology ls making concentration a profitable but dangerous practice. We submit this pro- gram: , Broadcasting and publishing should not be permitted to conglomerate. Such attempts as the current drive by American Express to take over McGraw-Hill (publishers of 30 magazines and 26 newsletters) can be pro\u00ad hibited under existing law; in telecommunl\u00ad ca tions, the licensee should be restricted to communications, for the license ts a privi\u00ad lege, not a right, and the holder should be obllged to observe boundaries in the public interest. Anti-trust exemptions !or the press should be removed; present law prohibits a news\u00ad paper from monopolizing the broadcasting in a given market; this should be extended to Umit the control of other newspapers in the same community; the anti-trust laws can be amended to break up combines. National banks, !or instance, are prohibited from do\u00ad ing business in more than a single state. Government can, as a principle, foster new entrants into the media; satelllte fac111t1es and similar regulated technologies should be made available to new applicants before they are preempted by AT&T, IBM and sim\u00ad ilar giants. Administrative vision, rather than new legislation, would be required. The Department of Justice (Anti-~ust Division) should be armed by legislation to deal aggressively with the trend toward glantism in communications. Publlc broadcasting, which has been suc\u00ad cessful in other countries needs strong gov\u00ad ernment support. In the U.S. it has a promis\u00ad ing beginning in an atmosphere of indus\u00ad try hostllity and government indifference. The Carnegie Institute's proposal, to assess private broadcasters a b1llion dollars annually to be applled to Public Broadcasting, ls a reasonable proposal. It should be looked upon as a user tax on licensees who derive enor\u00ad mous revenues from the public's airwaves. A serious professional effort should be made for self-reformation. As suggested by Max Kampelman, \"The recruitment and training of editors and reporters require change. News stories would have to be writ\u00ad ten less hastily; they would probably be longer and in greater depth, possibly at the risk of not being as llvely.\" An independent press council ls de,sirable to resolve disputes arising out of unfair press treatment. The broadcasting \"Fairness Doctrine\" must be revised so that dissenting views and minor! ty opinion can be heard and not legally strangled. \u00b7 Unless believers in democracy address the rapidly changing realities of modern com\u00ad munication, they wlll find that the revolu\u00ad tionary developments in technology have im\u00ad posed an invisible tyranny on our minds and society.e THE MINING OF ANTHRACITE COAL Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of my col\u00ad leagues a fine article written by Senator HEINZ, that has been published in En\u00ad vironment magazine (January-February 1979>. The article suggests a number of reasons why we should encourage the mining of anthracite coal. Since we in the East have a great deal of this type of coal waiting in the ground to be mined, I urge my colleagues to give careful at\u00ad tention to Senator HEINZ' article. I ask that the text of Senator HEINZ' article be printed in the RECORD. The article follows: THE CASE OF ANTHRACITE (By JOHN HEINZ) OVERVIEW Early this year the Environmental Pro\u00ad tection Agency will issue new regulations for electric ut111ty steam-generating plants which may well determine the future of the anthracite coal industry-and of the six northeastern Pennsylvania. counties where most of the high-Btu, low-sulfur coal is found. The December hea:rings on EPA's New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) re\u00ad veal some serious problexns inherent in the uniform application of environmental regu\u00ad lations. At the hearings, interested commu\u00ad nity action groups and representatives of the anthracite industry testified that, without special consideration for anthracite-fired electric utmty steam-generating plants, an\u00ad thracite will be tive with other coals; the result, they con\u00ad tend, will be the death of the industry, further economic decline in the anthracite region, a.nd more expensive and much de\u00ad layed reclamation of the scarred environ\u00ad ment of northeastern Pennsylvania. Their testimony reflects the view that, in estab\u00ad lishing pollution control requirements, the EPA Administrator must consider the eco\u00ad nomic and energy impacts of such regula\u00ad tions as well as their effect on air quality. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 ex\u00ad plicitly give the Administrator the authority to take such factors into a.ocount in deciding on the new source performance standards. In the case of the anthracite indi\\lStry, what is being asked for is exemption from the re\u00ad quirement that all ut111ty and industrial plants must install \"scrubbers\" in order to reduce sulfur emissions (see \"Overview,\" November 1978). The 17.5 blllion tons of reserves the U.S. Bureau of Mines has identified in northeast Pennsylvania represent 96 percent of the na\u00ad tion's total anthracite reserves and the only supply currently being mined. The combina\u00ad tion of the high heat value and low sulfur characteristics of this coal make anthracite environmentally attractive because it can be burned in compliance with EPA sulfur diox\u00ad ide emission ceillngs without the use of such post-combustion pollution control equip\u00ad ment as \"scrubbers.\" As a result of earlier deep-and strip-min\u00ad ing conducted without adequate environ\u00ad mental controls, this part of Pennsylvania ls currently an environmental disaster area. Over 900 million tons of coal refuse mar the visual quality of the anthracite region and the overflow from the abandoned deep mines contaminates the local water supply. While 6584 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE March 28, 1979 state and federal land and water reclamation programs have made some progress in con-. taining the destru\u00b7etive byproducts of previ\u00ad ous mining operations, the goal of total reclamation could be achieved much sooner and at significantly less expense if the clean\u00ad up were associated with active mining. The anthracite industry was founded in 1781, making anthracite the first coal com\u00ad mercially mined in the United States. But today it is in serious economic trouble. Pro\u00ad duction, which pealted at 100 mlllions tons in 1917, declined precipitously to only 5.2 milllon tons sixty years later, although total U.S. coal production in 1976 was 665 mlllion tons. The decline in anthracite production can be attributed to the availab1Uty of oil and natural gas, which are cheaper and more con\u00ad venient as home heating fuels. Although the residential sector still constituJtes 40 percent of annual domestic anthracite consumption, the future of anthracite depends on its abil\u00ad ity to compete in the electric utllity field\u00ad currently the second largest consumer of anthracite--and in the industrial market. Traditionally, the higher costs associated with anthracite have encouraged industry and ut111ties to favor bituminous coals. As a result of the technical difficulties involved in removing anthracite from steeply pitching seams of varying thickness, the price of an\u00ad thracite is higher than that of bituminous coal. In addition, due to its higher carbon content higher temperatures are required to ignite anthracite. To maintain these temper\u00ad atures during 1the combustion process, a larger boiler must be employed. Overall, spe\u00ad cial specifications for boilers and other com\u00ad bustion equipment make anthracite plants at least 15 percent more expensive than com\u00ad parable bituminous fac111ties. Any NSPS that requires installation of scrubbers on an an\u00ad thracite plant would effectively eliminate an\u00ad thracite as an alternative fuel source for electric utlllty steam-generating plants by exacerbating these cost problems. On the other hand, allowing this low-sulfur coal to be used without scrubbers could more than offset these higher costs. Permitting anthracite-fired facllltles to operate without scrubbers would have only a marginal impact on air quality. Over 80 per\u00ad cent of the anthracite reserves contain less than 0.75 percent sulfur by weight. Consider\u00ad ing that precombustion treatment can re\u00ad move up to 40 percent of the sulfur from anthracite and that an average of 8.8 percent of the sulfur ls retained in the bottom ash remaining after combustion, the 802 emis\u00ad sions from such a faclllty would often be less than those from a bituminous plant at which full 85 percent scrubbing ls achieved. In no case, however, would 802 emissions from an unscrubbed anthracite plant exceed the EPA emission ce111ng of 1.2 pounds of S02 per mil\u00ad lion Btu's. Data complled in a recent study by the Franklin Research Institute indicate that an anthracite-fired faclllty without scrubbers could produce electricity for 27 mills per kllo\u00ad watt hour (kwh). Electricity from a com\u00ad parable bituminous plant with scrubbers would cost 38 mllls per kwh, nearly 25 per\u00ad cent more than that from the anthracite\u00ad fired facmty. Such a cost advantage would not only encourage utmty companies to com\u00ad mit the sums of capital required for the con\u00ad struction of anthracite-fired steam-generat:. ing electric plants, but cut con\u00ad sumer energy bl11s. Two 600-megawatt powerplants capable of supplying a city of 600,000 persons would con\u00ad sume an average of 3 mllllon tons of anthra\u00ad cite per year. Over a forty-year life span, the coal would replace at least 500 million bar\u00ad rels of imported oil. An increase in produc\u00ad tion of this magnitude (more than 50 percent more than current output) would b~lng anthracite producers close to the ten mlllion tons per year capacity of the mining equip\u00ad ment they currently own. Increased mining of anthracite wm have beneficial environniental effects. It wlll occur at the sites of prior mtning op,erations, thus contributing to the cleanup of these scarred areas. Pennsylvania's Surface Mit\u00b5~g 9onser\u00ad vation and\u00b7 Reclamation Act of 1971 requires the cleanup of existing environment~! ~llm\u00ad age, in addition to restoration of any part of the environment disturbed by new mining operations. Therefore, the net effect of ex\u00ad panded mining activity wlll be environmen\u00ad tal benefits in the form of the reclamation of land and water resources that would oth\u00ad erwise remain in their damaged state. Presently there are at least 12,000 acres of coal refuse or culm banks and nearly 18,000 acres of abandoned strlpmlned land located throughout the anthracite region. The Frank\u00ad lin Research Institute study reports that reclamation without associated mineral ex\u00ad traction costs $110,000 per acre, whlle the same degree of cleanup achieved in conjunc\u00ad tion with mining activity would cost only $4,000 per acre. Pennsylvania's Bureau of Surface Mine Reclamation is currently .Pro\u00ad gressing toward the goal of total reclamation at a rate of 300 to 400 acres per year. At this rate, it will take 80 to 100 years to complete the process. In contrast, the Franklin Insti\u00ad tute concludes that a doubling of anthracite production would achieve essentially com\u00ad plete restoration by the year 2000. Similar positive effects would be realized in terms of water reclamation, if anthracite prOduction expands. A study by Berger As\u00ad sociates estimates that there are 375 billion gallons of acid mine water in 167 pools lo\u00ad cated in abandoned anthracite workings. Run-off from one site contributes the equiv\u00ad alent of 4,860 pounds of acid, 272 pounds of iron, and 8,190 pounds of sulfides per day to a local stream. In 1978 dollars, it costs $1.8 mlllion per month for electricity to operate pumps which lower these pools at the rate of 500 feet per year. Remlning these old workings could curtail 75 percent of the in\u00ad filtration of surface water and reduce pool volume by 50 percent by the end of the century. The cumulative present value of the col\u00ad lateral environmental benefits that would result from expanded anthracite mining over the next two decades, as estimated by the Franklin Institute, are on the order of $500 to $900 mllllon. Achieving these results requires a doubling of production. This in turn depends on the competitive vlabil1ty of anthracite in the electric utillty market. In terms of the local economy, a dou\u00ad bling of ianthraclte production could increase employment by 5,000 people in a region in which 32,000 people are currently looking for work. The wages earned by new anthra\u00ad cite miners would spur expansion in other sectors of the economy and at the same time increase the tax revenues of the region's cities and towns. Historically, the economy of northeastern Pennsylvania has been closely associated with the condition of the anthracite industry. While anthracite pro\u00ad duction probably will not return to the levels achieved during the early 1900s, it stlll has the ab111ty to serve as a source of economic rebirth for the entire region. A demographic analysis of the anthracite region reveals a population skewed toward older age groups, reflecting the tendency of younger individuals and families to leave the area in search of jobs. Approximately 12,000 residents of northeastern Pennsyl\u00ad vania are retired anthracite miners, who are relying in part on payments from the anthracite pension fund to support them\u00ad selves. These payments a.re derived from a fund maintained by contributions from anthracite producers based on the quantity of coal mined. As production and the work force decllned, so did the pension fund's assets. For nearly 17 years, retired anthra\u00ad cite miners have received a minimal sup-port payment of $30 per month. Expanding production will increase contributions to the pension fund and reduce the burden on the 3,600 currently employed and 12,000 retired anthracite miners. All the environmental, economic, and en\u00ad ergy benefits associated with a renaissance of the anthracite industry can be achieved without exceeding the emission ceiling that EPA has determined adequately protects air quality. EPA must now decide whether Lt will eliminate the low-sulfur a.dva.ntage of an\u00ad thracite by requiring the same post-combus\u00ad tion pollution control equipment for anthra\u00ad cite-burning plants as for those burning high-sulfur coal, .thus precluding the realiza\u00ad tion of many collateral environmental and economic benefits. Congress specifically gave the Administrator the flexib111ty to establish new source performance standards that achieve a. balance between environmental, energy, aind economic factors so as to maxi\u00ad mize the protection and improvement of the environment. Establishing a special stand\u00ad ard of anthracite that does not mandaite the installation of scrubber$ ls an example of how that balance could be a.chleved.e MAYOR-ELECT RICHARD BERKLEY, KANSAS CITY, MO. Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, yesterday the people of KaJllsas City, Mo., elected a new mayor, Richard Berkley. For the first time since 1925, Kansas citians have elected a. Republican to their highest post. I would like to congratulate Mr. Berkley and wish him well as he faces the many problems confronting urban America. Richard Berkley's clear-cut victory in\u00ad dicates to me that the people of Kansas City have found something appealing in the RepublicaJll philosophy. I look forward to continued growth and prosperity in Kansas City under the realistic and responsible management of Richard Berkley. I am sure that his ad\u00ad ministration will emphasize to all Amer\u00ad icans that Republicans can and will deal with the problems of America's cities\u00ad problems of unemployment, housing, and transportation. I anticipate that the message of Kan\u00ad sas City will be heard by other American cities, and that the politics of responsibil\u00ad ity, as practiced by Republicans through\u00ad out the country, can provide the answers to urban questions that once seemed insoluble. SENATOR STAFFORD DISCUSSES BILLBOARD CONTROL ON THE CBS MORNING NEWS Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the steady erosion in the effectiveness of the Federal Highway Beautification Act was examined in a recent report carried on the CBS Morning News. CBS pointed out that many believe that the highway beautification law had become the \"Bill\u00ad board Protection Act.'' During this CBS segment, our distin\u00ad guished colleague, Sena/tor STAFFORD, ap\u00ad peared to discuss his billboard control legislation, S. 344. I ask that a transcript of this segment from the CBS Morning News be printed in the RECORD. The material follows: March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENA TE 6585 'I'BANSCRIPT SCHIEFFER. Back when Lyndon Johnson was President, one of Lady Bird Johnson's pet projects was cleaning up the nation's roadsides. Mrs. Johnson's campaigning re\u00ad sulted in Congress passing a law, a clean-up law. but that law may not be doing what Mrs. Johnson thought it would. Nell Strawser ex\u00ad plains. NEIL. STRAWSER. The aim of the Highway Beautification Act of 1965 was a :federally funded highway like this one-landscaped, junkyards kept out of sight, and billboards kept 600 feet off the right of way. But now critics say it ls becoming the Highway Bill\u00ad board Protection Act. Some states are taking advantage of an original exemption to extend the commercial zones along highways, where signs are said to conform. And a 1978 amend\u00ad ment has curtalied the power of states and localities to remove offensive signs. Owners must be compensated, even if the signs have already paid for themselves. One of the Sen\u00ad ate's most vocal blllboard critics, Robert Stafford, says the act might as well be re\u00ad pealed. Sen. ROBERT STAFFORD. Well, in my opinion, to put it very briefly, I think the program, as it now exists, ls really protecting blllboards tn this country, instead of getting down non\u00ad conforming blllboards on the Interstate, the primary system of the country. And so, that's why I have proposed we turn the program back to the states, so the states who want to go ahead and get blllboards down can do so, and those that don't want to won't have to. And in the process, we'll avoid some govern\u00ad ment regulation, red tape, bureaucracy, and save some federal dollars. STR.A wsER. Stafford predicts the blllboarc;I lobby will fight his legislation, and appar\u00ad ently he ls right. The big outdoor advertising association of America would not comment, but another major group did. WILLIAM REYNOLDS '(Roadside Business Assoc.): We see too much good ln the pro\u00ad gram. We see that federally regulated ls easier to work with than 1! we had lt go back to the states, such as the senator ts proposing. STRAWSER. But ls this one industry that does not want deregulation? REYNOLDS. I would say, yes, sir. I am\u00ad emphatlcally. STRAWSER. Why? REYNOLDS. Look at the alrltne industry. Look what hap.pened to lt when it got de\u00ad regulated. It's a total chaos. STRAWSER. The blllboard lobby contends that polls show Americans want highway signs. Senator Stafford concedes publtc senti\u00ad ment against signs ls now weak, because en\u00ad vironmentalists who won the 1965 act have gone on to other fights.

Mr. President, on March 14, I reintroduced the Small Busi\u00ad ness Investment Incentive Act, S. 655. This legislation is designed to encourage the participation of individual investors in the serious problem of providing equity financing for our Nation's smaller businesses. Although legislation passed by the last Congress will go a long way toward stim\u00ad ulating investment in the equity marke~. I believe more must be done to attract investors to small businesses. An article entitled \"Going Public: Initial Stock Of\u00ad ferings Hurt by Poor Demand From Wary Investors\" which appeared in yesterday's Wall Street Journal substantiates my concerns about the availability of capi\u00ad tal for small business. I commend this axticle to my colleagues, and urge that they give serious attention to the prob\u00ad lems still encountered by smaller busi\u00ad nesses desiring to obtain growth capital. Mr. President, I ask that the following article be printed in the REcoRD. The article follows: INITIAL STOCK OFFERINGS HURT BY POOR DEMAND FROM WARY INVESTORS (By Vasil Pappas) American Management Systems wants to go public tihls spring. It's a pity !or AMS that this isn't the spring of 1969. Then, at the height of the stock market's new-issue boom, selling stock to the public was considered a natural step in corporate evolution. It was how young, Innovative firms raised the capital needed for :further growth. And 1 t was easy. AMS stock might well have been a high\u00ad fiyer. Ivan Selin, the company's 42-year-old founder and chairman, had two Ph.D's by age 2.S and ran the Pentagon's systems-anal\u00ad ysis group at age 32. And AMS has fulfilled its bright promise. Today, the nine-year-old company has become a leader in the com\u00ad puter-services industry. For the past three years, AMS revenues have been growing 56% a year, and return on equity has averaged 65%. SOME BIG PROBLEMS But se111ng new stock Issues to the publtc isn't easy these days, even for fiedgllng firms with Impressive credentials. The difficulties stem from greatly diminished investor inter\u00ad est and-from the sharply rlslng costs o! mak\u00ad ing an initial public offering. \"To go public today, it would have to be just a truly outstanding company, and I don't think there are that many out there,\" says William Hambrecht, a partner tn Ham;. brecht & Quist, a San Francisco investment\u00ad banking firm specializing in taking companies public. It many ways, AMS ts perhaps typical of companies waiting in the wings and hoping to go public. It's in a high-technology, hlgh\u00ad growth market; it needs additional capital to continue its rapid progress, and yet it's having to look hard at the difficulties of sell\u00ading stock. WARY INVESTORS The chief \u00b7difficulty ls the sharp decllne In the supply of capital available to new stock issues. Investors who bought new issues a decade ago generally a.re avoiding the mar\u00ad ket now. They a.re stlll smarting from losses sustained when prices of then-highly-touted new stocks plummeted. And with inflation rampant and a. recession widely anticipated, financial institutions and the remaining in\u00ad dlvidiua.l tnvestors are more inclined to choose less risky, more-liquid Investments such as bonds, which are yielding up to 11 percent. As a result, many small firms that otherwise might go public a.re staying privately held or merging with larger companies. The impact on initial public offerings has been heavy. Last year, only 46 companies raised a mere $250 milllon through new stock offerings, down from 1,026 companies raising $2.65 billion in 1969, according to Going Pub\u00ad lic magazine. This drop has stirred some reaction from the federal government. Last year, Congress took measures that may help reopen the capital market;s to small companies; Included were a cut in the maximum capital-gains tax rate to 28 percent from about 49 percent and a tripling to $1.5 milliop. of the amount that small companies can raise without filing a full-scale, expensive registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commis\u00ad sion. In addition, the Labor Department, which oversees pension-fund investments, formally clarified. Its investment criteria to make it easier for pension-fund managers to put modest portions of their assets Into smaller, riskier companies. The action re\u00ad duced the chance of lawsuits from fund ben\u00ad eficiaries if the investments sour. CURRENT PACE There's reason to believe that these moves may be helping renew interest in initial stock issues. This year through last week, 12 pub\u00ad licly underwritten new issues have been sold raising $50.6 million, up from four issues raising $5.6 mtllton in the year-earlier pe\u00ad riod, according to Going Publlc. But the pace remains far below that a decade a.go. Back in December 1969, launching a new business was simpler. Mr. Selin and four other Defense Department \"whiz kids\" de\u00ad cided to form AMS to sell to businesses the type of sophisticated computer analysis that they were doing in the Pentagon. Working nights and weekends, they assembled a 25- page, typewritten prospectus containing three pages of rosy financial projections, a business plan and their resumes. \"We had a good, but relatively vague, busi\u00ad ness plan, no assets and no cltents,\" says Charles Rossottl, AMS's 38-year-old presi\u00ad dent. \"If we to do that today, we'd be laughed at.\" BUJt back then, the prospectus drew three offers quickly, and in just two face-to-face meetings, the group sold 20 per\u00ad cent of the proposed company's stock for $300,000 to a predecessor company of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc., a big New York in\u00ad vestment-banking firm. The process took two months and cost less than $5,000. The next financing took longer and cost more. In 1972, when AMS was employing 60 people, the founders sold privately 16 per\u00ad cent of the company's equity to vent,ure\u00ad capltal firms for $650,000, at a per-share price that was 40 times earnings (the 400 common stocks used ln the Standard & Poor's lndus-6586 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENA TE March 28, 1979 trial index a.re currently averaging less than nine times earnings). \"If we'd been in busi\u00ad ness a little longer, we wouldn't have had the nerve to ask for that much,\" Mr. Ros\u00ad sotti comments. This time, the prospectus ran 100 pages, and the process took si:ic months. Out-of-pocket expenses for audit\u00ad ing, legal a.nd printing fees totaled $15,000, and the commission fee to the underwriting group was $35,000. Today, with more than 700 employees, AMS hopes to sell about a quarter of the company for roughly $6 million. It projects out-of\u00ad pocket expenses a.t $125,000-low by industry estimates-and commission fees at $420,000. The process, which began with a decision la.st September to try to go public, will take eight months-if the stock is sold in May. Typical of fast-growing companies, AMS is going public because it needs cash. \"They have to have a. fresh infusion of equity capi\u00ad tal to continue the growth they've had in the past,\" says Robert S. Cherouny, senior vice president of Union National First Bank of Washington, D.C. AMS recently negotiated a $6 million line of credit with _the bank; in\u00ad cluded is a $2 million term loan to finance projected growth until the stock is sold. Besides providing new funds, the offering will create a public market for AMS stock and thus allow the founders and key em\u00ad ployes who own shares to cash in. \"Wha. t we've been living on now is the fa.ct that lots of people think they'll be rich someday, and that gets old after a while,\" says Mr. Selin, who makes about $100,000 a year and will receive between $500,000 and $750,000 before taxes by selling some of his stock. ELEMENTS OF SUCCESS The success of the offering depends on three elements: a price attractive to inves\u00ad tors; support from lnstltutlonal investors, which generally lead the buying, and a healthy stock market. Earlier this month, AMS filed its preliminary registration state\u00ad ment with the SEC and printed 25,000 cop\u00ad ies of it for the investment community. In April, Lehman Brothers, which wlll head the underwriting group selling the stock, wm set up analyst meetings around the country to enable potential investors to meet and eval\u00ad uate AMS's top management. Then, assuming SEC approval of the filing, the current owners and the underwriters w111 hold the touchy negotiations right before the actual sale of the securities to determine the stock price. \"Every owner thinks his company is worth more than its offering price,\" one underwriter suggests. To fix a price, comparable companies in the same in\u00ad dustry are used as measures, and the price ls calculated as a multiple of current earnings. AMS, which last year earned $1.28 a share, hopes to get between $16 to $17 a she.re, or about 12 to 13 times earnings. If the com\u00ad pany can't get at least $13.50 a share, Mr. Selin says, it probably wm postpone the of\u00ad fering. \"We'd feel the market wasn't good enough,\" he explains. BOLE OF THE MARKET The stock market does hold the key. \"The Dow Jones (industrial) average has to be about 800 or higher for the offering to sell,\" or enough buyers won't be attracted to the stock at an acceptable price, says Steven Feinster, a Lehman Brothers partner. Other underwriters stress not so much where the market is a.s where it seems to be headed. In the ftrst nine months of la.st year, for example, the new-issue market was relatively strong, compared with the previous two yea.rs. But in October, a. steadily declining dollar and soaring interest rates sent the overall stock market plunging. Investors switched into safer investments, and funds in the new-issue market dried up. \"There were companies that investors just couldn't wait to buy when they were in registration 1n August, but when they came ~u~ in Oc\u00ad tober you couldn't give them away,\" one underwriter moans. Even 1f market conditions are acceptable, pricing a new issue ls difficult. U:\u00b5~er.writers want the price a few dollars below the level at which they think the she.res w111 open when trading begins. If the stock selia' below the offering price, the new stockholders' in\u00ad vestment has immediately declined in value, and the underwriters worry that their cus\u00ad tomers wlll be annoyed because the issue was priced too high. From an issuing company's viewpoint, however, prices can be set too low. When Auto-Trol Technology Corp. went public in late January at $13 a share, the stock soared to $17 in the first day of trading; and Donald Smith, chairman of the maker of computer\u00ad based design and drafting equipment, muses, \"You always wonder if you priced the stock high enough.\" Even after an issue has been traded for a while, nearly everyone involved wants the price to stay at or above the offering level. Investors expect consistently increasing quarterly earnings from new-issue compa\u00ad nies, just as they do from large, established ones. Any unwelcome surprises can send a new stock reeling. For example, Floating Point System, a Portland, Ore., maker or specialized computer-processing gear, went public last September, and the offering quickly sold out at $18 a share. But in December, the company unexpectedly an\u00ad npunced that it would report a loss for its fiscal first quarter, and the stock plunged $7.25 Jn one day to $12 bid, $13 asked-close to where it trades now. Such reactions worry AMS. \"One thing I'd hate to give up is the flexlb1Iity to make decisions that would be good in the long run but would depress quarterly earnings,\" Mr. Selin says. He adds that in 1975, not only did the company's earnings decline from the previous year, but one quarter showed a loss. Mr. Fenster, the prospective under\u00ad writer, comments, \"If they don't have faith in their earnings for 1979 and 1980, quarter by quarter, then it isn't a. good idea to go public now.\" ATI'RACTIVE ALTERNATIVE The most-attractive alternative to going public ls to sell out to another company. The chief advantage ls that the price iS completely negotiable and generally much higher than the return from going public. In purchasing publicly held companies, buy\u00ad ers in the past two years have been paying 60%-to-70% premiums over the stock-market price, says Peter Goodson, head of mergers and acquisitions for Kidder, Peabody & Co., a New York investment firm. Moreover, the high costs of bringing out a new issue are avoided. Mr. Selin, however, rules out a merger. He explains that a.ll the AMS founders (and principal stockholders) a.re still young and don't want to work for a new owner. But he concedes that to go public, the company will have to a.dd a f.ew outside directors and sev\u00ad eral extra employes to handle reports to the government and shareholders-and among the new employes would be \"someone smooth\" for investor relations, he says. Whether AMS decides to go public this spring depends on the stock market. Mr. Selin sa.ys the company has enough funds from the new bank credit and from opera\u00ad tions to finance growth for two years. But he isn't planning to wait !or a stock-market rally in the hope of getting a high price. \"The uncertainty of the market will make us do it earlier rather than later,\" he says.e S. 639_...;SMALL BUSINESS REVITAL\u00ad IZATION ACT OF 1979 e Mr. SCHMITT. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Small Business Revitalization Act introduced by Senator HEINZ. This legislation will allow businesses to depreciate the first $100,000 of machin\u00ad ery or equipment purchased each year over the following 3 years using the straight-line method. Capital investment in our economy has . been lagging far behind historical aver\u00ad ages. This action will encourage invest\u00ad ment by small businessmen to purchase new plant and equipment, adding to our Nation's productivity base and increas\u00ad ing the job formation process in the economy. There is a pressing need for simplifica\u00ad tion of the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The current depreciation provisions are extremely complex and of ten confusing to the small business\u00ad man without benefit of specialized staff. This legislation will greatly simplify these tax provisions allowing far more of the Nation's small businessmen to take advantage of the tax incentives in the Code. Small business is often called the back\u00ad bone of our country. It is a frequently overlooked fact that every large business was once a small one. Small business is the laboratory where the future of Amer\u00ad ica is developed. Concern for the health of small business is, therefore, not an academic exercise, it is a matter of the survival of our economic system. Right now, investment in our future is down. We must take action to encourage the flow of investment funds into the heart of our economy. The Small Business Revitalization Act will help to accomplish this, and I am pleased to cosponsor it with my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator HEINZ. I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD. The text of the bill fallows: s. 639 Be it enacted by the Senate and . House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Small Busi\u00ad ness Revitalization Act or 1979\".

Mr. President, on March 12, our distinguished majority leader, Mr. ROBERT BYRD, sent a very thoughtful letter to President Carter with respect to the pending proposal to reorganize the natural resource functions of the Government. In the most eloquent fashion, Mr. BYRD has urged the President not to submit a reorganization proposal under the provi\u00ad sions of the 1949 Reorganization Act. In\u00ad stead, the majority leader says that re\u00ad organization of such magnitude ought to be handled through the normal legisla\u00ad tive process. Mr. RIBICOFF, the distinguished chair\u00ad man of the Government Affairs Commit\u00ad tee has also sent the White House this identical message, and I find the argu\u00ad ments of both Senators compelling. I submit for the RECORD the majority leader's letter to the President. The letter fallows: THE PRESIDENT, The White House, Washington, D.C. MARCH 12, 1979. DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I am writing to ex\u00ad press my opposition to your intention to create a. new Department of Natural Re\u00ad sources by a reorganization plan. I urge you to submit your proposal for such a depart\u00ad ment to the requirements of the normal legislative process. The Reorganization Act authority on which you rely permits reorganization plans which change the name of a. department and transfer functions from one department to another. Since 1964, statutory restrictions written into renewals of the Reorganization Act have prohibited reorganization plans which \"provide !or'' or \"have effect of\" creating new cabinet departments. Congress has repeatedly made it clear -that major re\u00ad organizations of executive departments must be handled through the full legislative process. I have not reached any judgment about the merits of the proposed reorganization. I am familiar enough with the scope of the proposal to believe that proceeding by re\u00ad organization pla.n would violate the spirit, if not the letter, of the Reorganization Act. Proposals for a Department of Natural Re\u00ad sources have a long history. and they have excited support and aroused opposition pre\u00ad cisely because they represented a major de\u00ad parture from our current approach to resource management. Transferring major agencies like the Forest Service, which in-eludes 26 percent of the employees of the Department o! Agriculture, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admlnlstration, which comprises 43 percent of the Commerce Department, are the earmarks of a major reorganization. The goal of the reorganiza\u00ad tion-the creation of one department with the mission and the power needed to man\u00ad age our precious natural resources in a. com\u00ad prehensive and f\u00b7ar-sighted way-plainly in\u00b7 dicates that a new department is envisioned. The Reorganization Act, of cour'Se, places strict time limits on Congress and ultimately permits Congress only an up or down vote on the plan submitted. For this reason, pro\u00ad ceeding by plan precludes the kind of study and amendment, refinement and compro\u00ad mise that follows from full Congressional consideration. The process and its limits are well-suited to minor transfers within the Executive Branch. However, in a major re\u00ad organization, proceeding by plan improperly transfers what are essentially legislative functions and responsibilities from Congress to the White House. Moreover, a new department created by reorganization plan ls destined to be inade\u00ad quate. Presumably, the Administration seeks this reorganization because our current ap\u00ad proach to resource management evolved piecemeal over time, and the agencies are hampered by mandates which a.re overlap\u00ad ping or irreconcilable. A reorganization plan cannot include a statement of mission for the department. It cannot spell out the powers which the Secretary must have to pull together a. department comprised of agencies which have traditionally been in\u00ad dependent a.nd sometimes antagonistic. These and other issues essentially to the department's success can only be addressed through legislation. The Administration may believe that pro\u00ad ceeding by plan affords the best cha.nee of success. This conclusion seems highly ques\u00ad tionable, at best. Proceeding in this fashion gives Senators a reason to oppose the pro\u00ad posal, regardless of its merits. There is one other unfortunate political consequence: Supporters of the status quo will fight the idea. regardless of its format, but the chance to rally the support of those who might be enthusiastic could be lost if the effort ts portrayed as a ma.jor reorganization, to be brought about by plan rather tha.n the normal legislative process. For all these reasons, I urge you to recon\u00b7 sider this matter. Sincerely yours, RoBERT C. BYRD . THE TAX REVOLT IS LIKE A POT OF TEXAS CHILI Mr. TOWER. Mr. President, yester\u00ad day we continued debate on legislation to increase the temporary debt limita\u00ad tion to the staggering sum of $830 bil\u00ad lion. At that time the Senate rejected an amendment which would have forced, for the first time, a measure of disci\u00ad pline into the budgetary process by mak\u00ad ing future debt increases, unless Sena\u00ad tors feel that extenuating economic cir\u00ad cumstances dictate otherwise, contin\u00ad gent upon attaining a balanced Federal budget. As a cosponsor of this measure, I sincerely regret the missed opportunity to take the first step in heeding the will of the American taxpayer, who wants performance-not just promises-from Congress in controlling a Federal budg\u00ad et that has run wild. I would like to make clear at the out\u00ad set that, to the Senator from Texas, a balanced budget is far from fanciful. It is now on the verge of fulfillment. I am 6588 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENA TE March 28, 1979 sure my colleagues can appreciate the satisfaction in seeing the Senate so se\u00ad riously consider this matter after so many years of spending as though there were no tomorrow. We cannot continue to spend money we do not have on pro\u00ad grams we do not need in the vain hope of being all things to all people. At last, this economic reality has come to be rec\u00ad ognized. Now, the .CONGRESSIONAL RECORD is filled with bills and speeches about a balanced budget. It warms my heart to see so many Members of Congress ac\u00ad knowledge the damage done to our econ\u00ad omy by votes of years past. We have overdosed on the outworn Keynesian remedy of always looking to deficits to invigorate the economy. There is no better advocate of temperance than a reformed drinker, and what better dis\u00ad ciples of fiscal responsibility could there be than reformed deficit spenders. In our newfound inclination to return to commonsense economics, we have considered two commendable amend\u00ad ments to the debt ceiling bill. In different ways, those amendments would have demonstrated our determination to move gradually toward less inflation, lower taxes, and a balanced budget. Rejection of those amendments is an early warn\u00ad ing signal to the public that this Con\u00ad gress is doing business as usual. While I will not venture to predict the ultimate outcome of the debate on budg\u00ad etary restraint and tax reduction, I do want to look beyond the legislation at hand to consider the options which, sooner or later, we will not be able to evade. For even if the Senate declines to commit itself to a balanced budget at this time, even if the Congress finds ways of avoiding action on tax cut pro\u00ad posals repeatedly offered by members of the minority, the tax revolt issue is here to stay and will follow each and every Member of this body like his shadow un\u00ad til its demands are addressed. Whether or not the requisite number of States eventually pass resolutions call\u00ad ing for a Constitutional Convention, it is obvious that a great many Americans want more than just good intentions when it comes to a balanced Federal budget. In this Senator's view, statutory action is pre.f erable over the more drastic means of amending our Constitution. But whatever we do, it must \u00b7be unmistakably clear to Congress, to the administration, and to the public that we mean business. The simple way of balancing the budget is to cut Federal spending until we reach the level of our incoming reve\u00ad nues. Not a bad idea. There is reason to suspect, however, that some of the most ardent budget-balancers would be reluc\u00ad tant to apply that remedy. Moreover, the brief performance of the 96th Con\u00ad gress to date makes it unlikely that of\u00ad ficial Washington has the will to knock $30 billion to $40 billion off the Presi\u00ad dent's budget by cutting programs re\u00ad garded as sacrosanct by their proponents. In committee after committee, hear\u00ad ings are being held on the alleged need for more Federal spending across the board. New programs are being launched left and right, but mostly left. There is a monstrous new Federal child care pro-gram in the works, scQemes for socialized medicine in doses large and not so large, and a m~lti-billion-doUar expansion of welfare. Most ludicrous of all, an attempt is unq~l'Way to lift the cap on the food st~mP program, thereby allowing its costs for fiscal year 1980 to increase by well over $1 billion. There is not any Arab shiek that is going to pick up the bill; there is not a tooth fairy that is going to pick up the bill. I assure you, it is going to be paid by the American people. But while the carter administration is trying to im\u00ad pose wage guidelines on those who work for a living, it wants to remove spending limitations on those who profit from taxes. Scripture warns us that things hidden in darkness will come to light. So it will be with Federal spending. When the first concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1980 reaches the fioor of the Senate within the next month, then the Senate's disinclination to cut spending will be in the spotlight for public repro\u00ad bation. A second alternative for budget bal\u00ad ancing is to make Federal revenues match spending by hiking taxes. I feel as kindly to that approach as a jack\u00ad rabbit does to a rattlesnake. But here in Washington, there is a lobby for every\u00ad thing, higher taxes as well as rattle\u00ad snakes. Only, the high-tax lobby uses code words to conceal its real intent. Its favorite is \"tax loopholes,\" which means any provision of the Internal Revenue Code which allows taxpayers to keep some of their earnings. Another is. \"tax expenditure,\" an ingenious way of contending that, when the Federal Government allows a person to keep his earnings through a deduction or exemp\u00ad tion, it is \"spending\" revenues. What a clever way of positing that all wealth belongs, by divine right, to the Govern\u00ad ment. Now, you would think that high\u00ad taxers would be as successful during the tax revolt as buying steers to stock a breed herd. But not so. They manage to accomplish their goals through the dia\u00ad bolical mechanism of inflation. As Amer\u00ad ican workers race to keep up with the price spiral, it pushes them into higher and higher tax brackets. Thus, the Fed\u00ad eral Government reaps a nasty financial windfall from misery in the form of bigger tax receipts. It may be legal, \"but it ain't nice.\" Even so, we can try to balance the budget in the short run by hiking taxes, directly or indirectly. The problem is that, by the time the Federal Govern\u00ad ment taxes away from the public enough wealth to cover its budget, the combina\u00ad tion of raging inflation and disincentives to work or invest\u00b7 will have brought the economy to its knees. But there is another way, a proposal that has been repeatedly made and brought to a vote by members of the minority in the 95th Congress: While gradually reducing Federal spending, we can simultaneously reduce Federal tax\u00ad ing, thereby restoring incentives to work, save, invest, grow, develop, hire, train, promote, and prosper. We can hack out of the Federal tax code the confiscatory taxes which are choking the productive industry of the American people. We can liberate the ingenuity and energy of Americans; for it is they who a.re the driving power behind our economy, while the Congress does little but keep its foot on the brake. That, my friends, is the surest way\u00ad in the realm of political possibility, per\u00ad haps the only way-to reach our goal of a balanced budget. Cut spending and cut taxes. Let the resulting new wave of economic expansion generate the in\u00ad creased tax revenues which follow upon greater prosperity. There is but one obstacle in our way. It is not practical. It is ideological. Official Wiashington is populated with persons whose entire careers are based upon the outworn dogma that problems arise from the private sector while solu\u00ad tions a.rise from Government. What a splendid bit of old-fashioned statism. It is as irrelevant as a whalebone corset, and every bit as restrictive. Blind adher\u00ad ence to that doctrine is what keeps the Congress from joining the tax revolt. What is really sticking in the craw of capitol Hill, though, is not a matter of money or economics. It is a matter of power: Whether the most powerful and prosperous economy the world has known will be dominated by the producers and consumers, on the one hand or, on the other, by Federal officials. That is the real question the Senate faces as it considers amendments to the debt ceiling bill and other measures down the road. To those of my colleagues who are tantalized by the doctrines of the past, who oppose whatever legisla\u00ad tion will secure a balanced budget through the tandem tactics of spending cuts and tax reduction, I would respect\u00ad fully offer a prudential warning: The tax revolt is like a pot of Texas chili. If you lock the lid on while it is simmer\u00ad ing, you will only bring it to a boil. But let it simmer long enough, and the powerful concoction will blow the lid off. If the Senate tries to lock the lid on the tax revolt by rejecting amendments for a balanced budget and tax cuts, we will be lucky if it is only chili we will be scraping off the ceiling. CONGRESSIONAL AWARD ACT PROGRAM, S .. 221 Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have re\u00ad cently joined as a cosponsor to S. 221, a bill which would establish a congres\u00ad sonal award program to promote and recognize achievement and leadership among our Nation's young persons. This bill was introduced by the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. WALLOP) and has a large number of cosponsors, indicative of the congressional interest and support in this bill. It would be hard to name a program which is more attractive than the one proposed in this legislature. The con\u00ad gressional award is intended to give young persons a legitimate, worthwhile goal to strive toward, and to help de\u00ad velop in themselves qualities which we have traditionally recognized as desir\u00ad \u00b7able. Through the creation of the con\u00ad gressional awards, persons 'between the March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE . 6589 ages of 14 and 23 are invited to compete with themselves for this award. It is my understanding that the awards are being de5igned in such a way so that individual initiative and perseverance are more important to achieving the awards than brain and brawn. The intent behind the awards is that they are not to be obtain\u00ad able simply by those persons who are in the top performance level of their age group but that rather all young persons will be inspired to work individually to\u00ad ward receiving the award. Because receipt of the award is based on the accomplishment of three sec\u00ad tions--public service, personal interest, and exploration-working toward the award will help the individual to get to know both his community and himself. It is my hope that by working toward this award, young persons will gain a sensitivity and appreciation of the prob\u00ad lems in our society and ways in which they can make a difference. The bill contains no Federal author\u00ad ization, for one of the purposes of the project is to enlist private support in the congressional award program. I am pleased that already a respectable sum of money has been raised for this pro\u00ad gram, and find this indicative of the Nation's receptiveness to this idea. Mr. President, the Senator from Kan\u00ad sas is pleased to indicate once again his support for the congressional award pro\u00ad gram and his cosponsorship of S. 221. I hope that it can be considered in the near future. OFFICE OF HISPANIC AFFAIRS, s: 788 Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators DoMENICI, TOWER, and DECONCINI in introducing a bill to estab\u00ad lish an Office of Hispanic Affairs in the Executive Office of the President. AN EMERGING AMERICA The reintroduction of this measure is particularly important in light of the estimated 20 million Americans of His\u00ad panic descent. We can no longer ignore the fact that a nation within a nation is emerging-along the border from Cali\u00ad fornia. to Texas, and in such nonborder cities as Los Angeles, Houston, Denver, and even in some cities in my home State of Kansas, Hispanic Americans make up a significant number of the population. In 1976, according to the Census Bureau, there were about 6.5 million Mexican Americans in the United States. Today the Mexican-American population in the southwest alone is believed to number more than 8 million. Whatever the pre\u00ad cise number, the growth of Hispanic Americans in this country also needs to be reflected in the meaningful participa\u00ad tion of Government. OFFICE OF HISPANIC AFFAIRS Mr. President, the introduction of this legislation is not the first and final effort in addressing this concern. More will need to be done as we begin to learn and understand the needs and concerns of this emerging American population. As a first step in this effort, this measure is being introduced to establish an Office of Hispanic Affairs in the Executive Of-fice of the President, charged with ad\u00ad vising the Federal\u00b7 Government's execu\u00ad tive departl'I\\(mts and agencies on policies affecting the ever increasing Hispanic American populatiP:n. This measqre would replace a Cabin~t~level executive committee for Hispanics that expired on December 31, 1974. \u00b7 I believe this legislation would help address problems which have long ham\u00ad pered the development and upward mo\u00ad bility of the Hispanic American, that is, critical unemployment, low-level educa\u00ad tion, inadequate housing and health care, unf amlliarity with the English language, and disposition to political apathy. AN ACCURATE COUNT A particular area of great importance to Hispanic Americans, which this legis\u00ad lation could help address, is the full and complete enumeration of this popula\u00ad tion. It is vitally important when you consider that the Federal Government uses census data to calculate the alloca\u00ad tion of almost $15 billion annually to State and local governments for Federal assistance programs, to insure equal em\u00ad ployment opportunities and to protect voting rights. Racial and ethnic data collected by various agencies are essential tools with which to combat discrimination and monitor affirmative action programs to remedy past discrimination. The collec\u00ad tion and analyses of this data is the most effective and accurate means of measur\u00ad ing Federal program impact on minor\u00ad ity beneficiaries and for assuring that equal employment opportunity policies are working effectively. Mr. President, I do not suggest this bill will provide all the solutions to the problems of Hispanic Americans, but I do believe it will begin to address and provide the same benefits long enjoyed by other Americans. This bill offers a long overdue opportunity for the Senate to show its understanding and support for the aspirations of all Hispanic Americans. I welcome my colleagues ta join with me as cosponsors of this very important legislation; and I especially welcome my colleagues to join with me to expedite this proposal for early con\u00ad sideration and passage by the Senate. Mr. TOWER. Mr. President, \u00b71t is a pleasure to join once again with three of my colleagues--Mr. DOMENICI, Mr. DOLE, and Mr. DECONCINI-in introduc\u00ad ing legislation that would create an Of\u00ad fice of Hispanic Affairs in the Executive Office of the President, and in each of the many Federal agencies that bear respon\u00ad sibility for resolving the myriad of prob\u00ad lems that confront our Hispanic-Ameri\u00ad can population. Since 1974, I have advocated the es\u00ad tablishment of such offices in the execu\u00ad tive branch of our Government. In 1976, my colleagues and I introduced \u00b7a joint resolution calling for an Office of His\u00ad panic Affairs. Two years ago, we intro\u00ad duced S. 1066, the immediate predeces\u00ad sor of our current legislation. The His\u00ad panic Affairs Act of 1979 represents an even more comprehensive approach to the needs of Hispanic-Americans than these past legislative initiatives. It spells out in greater detail the duties and re\u00ad sponsibilities of the proposed office, and it increases the number and widens the scope of Federal programs to be over\u00ad seen. I am pleased to participate in the pres\u00ad entation of this strengthened version of our earlier bill, especially in light of this country's increasing recognition of the need for closer cooperation with our neighbors in Mexico. This acknowledge\u00ad ment of our growing interdependence provides, I believe, the proper atmosphere in which to enact the legislation we pro\u00ad pose. Overtures by the administration to the Republic orf Mexico in search of better economic and political ties signify the rediscovery that our neighbor to the south is, indeed, an important and neces\u00ad sary ally. They underline the recognition that, far too long, we have ignored the needs of our Hispanic neighbors and the problems facing our own Hispanic-Amer\u00ad ican population. Hispanic Americans constitute the fastest growing segment of our populace. The legislation that we propose would enable this expanding portion of our pop\u00ad ulation to enter more fully into the eco\u00ad nomic and social main.stream of America. It would also help to alleviate the real knowledge of ,many of our Hispanic Americans that the Federal Government is insensitive to their special problems. The establishment of an Office of ms\u00ad panic Affairs would insure that Hispanic Americans have representation i.n the highest councils of the Federal Govern\u00ad ment. The broadened communication and closer working relationship resulting from enactment of this legislation would be of i.ncalculable benefit to American Hispanics--now the fourth largest Span\u00ad ish-speaking population in the Western Hemisphere. It is my strong conviction that enactment of the Hispanic Affairs Act of 1979 will serve our Nation's inter\u00ad ests both here at home and abroad. Therefore, I earnestly solicit the suppart of my colleagues for this legislation; sup\u00ad port that I feel is of vital importance for our Hispanic-American fellow citizens. CHANGE OF VOTE-ROLLCALL NO. 23 Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I noticed in going through the RECORD of yester\u00ad day's events that on rollcall No. 23, the so-called DeConcini amendment, I am listed as voting in the negative. It was my understanding yesterday that it was a straight up-or-down vote on the De\u00ad Concini amendment in which I thought I was voting against the DeConcini amendment. I am recorded in effect as being in favor, and I ask unanimous consent that the permanent RECORD re\u00ad :fiect my vote to table the DeConcini amendment in yesterday's proceedings. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The statement of the Senator will appear in the RECORD. Is there objectfon to the Senator's changing his vote? The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered. 6590 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE March 28, 1979 NUCLEAR WASTE MANAGEMENT REORGANIZATION ACT OF 1979, s. 742 Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, I have a revised version of S. 742, the bill I in\u00ad troduced on Thursday, March 22, with Senator GLENN, and which is currently being held at the desk. I ask unanimous consent that this revised version be substituted for the original and be re\u00ad f erred to the appropriate committee. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. <The bill (S. 742) was referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.) Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, Senator GLENN and I are introducing this bill at a crucial time in the national debate on nuclear waste management. In recent months that debate has become focused on the efforts of the interagency review groUP <mG) on nuclear waste manage\u00ad ment. The ma has spent a year review\u00ad ing the issue and formulating recom\u00ad mendations for administration policy. It has summarized its conclusions in a re\u00ad port issued last week. The ma effort has encouraged a. broad discussion of the issues which must be addressed as we formulate nuclear waste management policy. It is now up to the Congress to address those issues and, where appropriate, to pass legislation to insure that they are resolved. The issues facing us today are of\u00b7 two kinds: Technical and institutional. The technical issues include doubts as to the geologic formations and waste packaging best suited to permanent nuclear waste disposal. While Congress itself cannot \"resolve\" all of the technical issues being raised today, it can, and I believe should, express confidence that those issues can be resolved given the proper research. It is in the institutional area where direct congressional action is most clearly needed. If there is a nuclear waste management crisis today, it exists not because the technical issues are so in\u00ad tractable, but because the Federal pro\u00ad grams designed to address them have been so inadequate. Those programs have in the past been poorly planned, poorly managed, and poorly coordinated, and have lacked coherent principles to guide their development. The result has been a dramatic loss in public confidence in the Federal Gov\u00ad ernment's ability to do the job. This drop in public confidence has been accom\u00ad panied by a blurring of public percep\u00ad tions of the issues. The technical issues have grown in stature and have become inseparably linked to the Federal Gov\u00ad ernment's inability to deal with them, so that the public now perceives nuclear waste as an ominous problem to which there may be no solution. Some members of the Federal Govern\u00ad ment have finally come to recognize the significance of this s~tuation. In testi\u00ad mony before Senator GLENN'S Energy Nuclear Prolif era ti on and Federal Serv\u00ad ices Subcommittee, Gus Speth of the Council on Environmental Quality noted that: . . . We all inherited a seriously flawed federal program that has provided a poor basts !or getting to the right answer quickly and llttle basis !or publlc confidence. The history o! waste management in the United States provides warning o! the risks o! hav\u00ad ing promQtio~al concerns. It is a his\u00ad tory o! failure to produce an acceptable ~ethod o! waste disposal. Devising a pro\u00ad gram for the future must take into account the loss o! credlb111ty that has ensued; it wm not be enough to devise a program that could be credible under other circumstances. I agree wholeheartedly with these comments. Reestablishing public confi\u00ad dence in Federal nuclear waste manage\u00ad ment programs will not be easy, but it is essential if those programs are to be successful. In order to win back the public's con\u00ad fidence, we must identify and correct the weaknesses in current Federal nu\u00ad clear waste programs. We must antici\u00ad pate the challenges which those pro\u00ad grams will face in the future, and insure that they are equipped to handle them. Last, we must base those programs on sound principles which can guide their development in the future and gain pub\u00ad lic acceptance for the results they pro\u00ad duce. I see two areas where improvements must be made, and which are addressed in this legislation. The first involves pol\u00ad icy formation and program planning at the national level, and the second in\u00ad volves the siting and development of nuclear waste disposal facilities. On the issue of policy formation and program planning, I believe there are three main deficiencies in the way that these activities are being undertaken to\u00ad day. First, the efforts of the various Fed\u00ad eral agencies and departments with re\u00ad sponsibilities for nuclear waste manage\u00ad ment are poorly coordinated. Efforts un\u00ad dertaken by some agencies are unneces\u00ad sarily duplicated by others, and as pro\u00ad gram objectives shift there is a danger that the regulations needed to license those programs will not be in place in time. Second, there is no policy planning process which involves all of the relevant Federal agencies and departments in the formation of a comprehensive, govern\u00ad mentwide policy toward nuclear waste. Indeed, even within these various agen\u00ad cies and departments there seems to be little in the way of rigorous policy plan\u00ad ning. Last, State and local government om\u00ad cials and the public have no way to provide meaningful input into Federal nuclear waste policy. Decisions which will ultimately affect some States and localities very directly are made in the depths of the bureaucracy and buried within budget legislation. It should hardly be surprising, given the current mood of distrust of the Federal Govern\u00ad ment, that States, localities, and the pub\u00ad Uc are likely to oppose such decisions when they are implemented. I do not belie\\e that the answer to these problems lies in creating a new Federal agency for nuclear waste man\u00ad agement. The legislation which Senator GLENN and I are introducing contains several provisions which will correct these deficiencies while leaving primary responsibility for nuclear waste man-agement where it is now, in the Depart\u00ad ment of Energy. First, our bill proposes the establish\u00ad ment of a Nuclear Waste Coordinating Committee. The coordinating commit\u00ad tee would consist of representatives of the various Federal agencies which have responsibilities relating to nuclear waste management, including DOE, DOI, CEQ, EPA, and the NRC. It would also have a member representing the Nuclear Waste Management Planning Council, which I will discuss shortly. The committee would be chaired by the representative of the Department of Energy. The coordinating committee would have several functions. First it would work to improve coordination of the efforts of its member agencies, and to resolve jurisdictional disputes and scheduling conflicts. If necessary, it would make recommendations to the President on these issues. Second, in each of the first 5 years of its existence, the committee would be required to prepare a comprehensive nuclear waste management plan describ\u00ad ing current and planned Federal nu\u00ad clear waste management programs. In preparing the plan, the members of the committee would work to integrate and reconcile the views of their respective organizations. If agreement could not be reached among committee members on key provisions of the plan, the differ\u00ad ent views would be brought to the at\u00ad tention of the President and resolved by him. The resulting final document, which would represent Government\u00ad wide nuclear waste policy, would then be submitted to Congress. A key feature of the bill is the creation of a Nuclear Waste Management Plan\u00ad ning Council. The members of the Coun\u00ad cil would be appointed by the President, and would include 11 officials of State or local government, and 4 private cit\u00ad izens. The Council would be the mecha\u00ad nism through which these groups could participate in the formation of Federal nuclear waste policy. A representative of the Council would participate fully in the activities of the coordinating commit\u00ad tee, including the preparation of the annual nuclear waste management plan. The Council would also advise the vari\u00ad <lUS Federal agencies on nuclear waste management issues. I believe that these measures would correct the deficiencies I discussed above. While they require the creation of two new Government entities, I believe that is an acceptable price to pay. Wherever possible, Senator Glenn and I have tried to minimize that price. We have for ex\u00ad ample \"sunsetted\" the preparation of the annual plan, in the expectation that after 5 years a stable and comprehen\u00ad sive Federal nuclear waste policy will have emerged. One of the best arguments for the measures we are advocating has been . the ma effort itself. Whatever its fail\u00ad ings, the IRG has produced some highly valuable self-criticism of the Federal Government's nuclear waste manage\u00ad ment efforts. It has forced the agen\u00ad cies to come together, to ask themselves March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 6591 tough questions about what each of them was doing and why, and finally to try to put the pieces together in a defensible and coherent whole. T~e value of such a process was noted by Worth Bateman of the Department of Energy, in testimony before the Energy and Environment Subcommittee of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee: The Administration also recognizes that a successful waste management policy is not just a DOE policy. It must be developed in conjunction with the many executive agen\u00ad cies which already have a statutory role or other interests bearing directly on waste management. Moreover, a successful policy also requires broad public understanding, participation and support. I agree with Mr. Bateman's assessment, and believe that the measures we have suggested will insure that a rigorous pol\u00ad icy formation process will be employed in the future. The second main area we have ad\u00ad dressed in the legislation is the process by which nuclear waste repositories are sited and developed. As their mistrust of Federal nuclear waste management pro\u00ad grams has grown, State governments have increasingly demanded the right to stop the construction of Federal nuclear waste repositories within their borders. Although the Federal Government seems clearly to have preempted the States' right to control the siting of such facil\u00ad ities, a dozen States have nevertheless enacted laws which purport to give them some control over repository siting. Whether such laws are valid or not, it is clear that States have numerous other legal and political tools at their disposal with which they can effectively stop con\u00ad struction of Federal nuclear waste repositories. The dangers of this situation cannot be overemphasized. Given the current at\u00ad mosphere, the Federal Government will be lucky to find States willing to accept these repositories. Even if it finds such States, we have no assurances that they will contain the best sites for repositories. Clearly, a major revision in Federal policy is needed. If such a revision is not made, repository siting could well prove to be the Achilles' heel of the entire nuclear waste management effort. In revising the current process, we must recognize several key facts. First, it is clear that States do have legitimate concerns about nuclear waste reposi\u00ad tories, or more precisely, about the Fed\u00ad eral Government's ability to construct and operate them safely. This mistrust is the sad legacy of the past performance of the Federal Government. In order to overcome it, we must establish a process which allows States to raise their legiti\u00ad mate concerns about these facilities and insures that those concerns will be addressed. On the other hand, we must realize that ultimate control over the siting of nuclear waste repositories should remain in the hands of the Federal Government. If State Governments are given unlim\u00adited veto power over such repositories, I believe they will utilize that power whether or not their fears about them are legitimate. Public anxiety about the problem is so great that most, if not all, State governments would be forced to exercise' the veto. In. short', bqth the State reposi\u00ad tory siting contain absolutely essential to a successful re\u00ad pository siting process. Neither approach alone is likely to produce desirable re\u00ad sults, given the current atmosphere of public mistrust. Clearly then we must seek a \"middle ground\" between the two approaches, one which incorporates their essential elements while excluding their principal flaws. The legislation Senator Glenn and I are proposing attempts to set forth such an approach. Under the bill, the Federal Government would be required to pro\u00ad vide early notification to the Governor of a State of its intention to construct a repository for high level nuclear waste, spent nuclear fuel or TRU-wastes in that State. Upon receiving such notification, the Governor could convene a repository review panel to participate in the plan\u00ad ning of the repository. The review panel would consist of the Governor, who would serve as chairman, together with other State and local government offi\u00ad cials and concerned private citizens from the State, and representatives of con\u00ad cerned adjacent States. The Nuclear Waste Coordinating Com\u00ad mittee which I described earlier would be required to prepare a detailed reposi\u00ad tory review report for the proposed repository. The report would contain de\u00ad scriptions of the design of the facility and proposed operating procedures for it, safety and environmental analyses, and plans for transporting wastes and providing economic assistance to affected States and localities. The representative of the Department of Energy would take the lead in the preparation of the report, and would have the authority to resolve disputes among committee members over its contents. In preparing the re\u00ad port, the committee would be required to consult closely with the review panel and incorporate \u00b7its views into the report to the maximum extent feasible. When the committee finished the re\u00ad port, it would submit it to the review panel for final review. If the Governor who convened the panel believed that the report did not adequately protect. State and local interests, he could, after consulting with other panel members, raise formal objections to the report. If he did not raise formal objections, li\u00ad censing and construction of the facility could proceed. If the Governor did raise formal ob\u00ad jections, the repository could not be built unless the Congress passed a concurrent resolution stating that the report ade\u00ad quately balanced State, local and na\u00ad tional interests. Congress would have 60 days in which to consider such a reso\u00ad lution, with such consideration taking place under highly expedited proce\u00ad dures. If Congress did not pass a reso\u00ad lution in the 60-day period, the reposi\u00ad tory could not be built unless a revised repository development report was pre\u00ad pared. The revised report would have to be prepared under the same procedures, and would be subject to the same review, as was the original report. I believe that thls approach reconciles the conflicting needs of giving the States a significant role in repository siting while maintaining ultimate Fed\u00ad eral control. Under this proposal, States would have the right to demand that Congress review the Federal Govern\u00ad ment's plans for a repository to ensure that they adequately protect the inter\u00ad ests of affected States and localities. The debate over those plans would be highly visable, and the decision on their ade\u00ad quacy would be made by elected members of Congress responsible to their constitu\u00ad ents. Congress would have the right, if it was satisfied that the plans adequately responded to legitimate States and local concerns, to direct that the repository be built. This process has several inherent ad\u00ad vantages. First, it would force the Fed\u00ad eral Government to thoroughly plan these facilities and establish their safety prior to constructing them. The review panels would provide forums through which the States could participate in the preparation of those plans from the out\u00ad set, and thereby develop confidence in them and in the Federal Government it\u00ad self. Both the States and the Federal Government would have clear incentives to participate in this process in a respon\u00ad sible manner, since both would know that their cases might be scrutinized by the Congress. Several additional comments should be made about the process we are proposing. First, I would like to address the ques\u00ad tion of whether Congress is up to the role which this bill would give to it. To begin with, the bill does not ask Con\u00ad gress to make final, definitive judgments on the complex technical issues which will undoubtedly be raised about these facilities. Instead, it asks Congress to make a general finding about whether the Federal Government has done a de\u00ad f ensible job of addressing those issues and other issues which are of concern to the States. In short, it asks Congress to play a vigorous oversight and review role. Such congressional review would not replace or prejudge either the NEPA process or NRC licensing of these facili\u00ad ties, and it would be through those proc\u00ad esses that final judgments would be passed on the complex technical issues. It could be argued that Congress will not be able to address an issue such as this on the merits alone, that the vote in the S~nate will be 98 to 2 against the State in which a repository is to be lo\u00ad cated. I do not accept these arguments. Congress has repeatedly shown that it can act responsibly on an issue such as this and can strike a fair balance be\u00ad tween national and local interests. Good examples can be found in some of the environmental and parks bills which Congress has considered recently. The nuclear industry may worry that the process we are proposing will be time consuming and will carry with it an element of uncertainty. However, I believe that it has less potential for delay and uncertainty than either the current situation or any of the alternatives I have heard proposed. To begin with, it 6592 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE March 28, 1979 should \u00b7be emphasized that, if current expectations hold, the process I have outlined would be employed only a hand\u00ad ful of times before the turn of the cen\u00ad tury. Furthermore, under our proposal, the role of the States, the Federal Gov\u00ad ernment and Congress are clearly defined and circumscribed. If and when objec\u00ad tions come up to the Congress, they will be considered under highly expedited procedures which will prevent the ~e of dilatory parliamentary tactics and ensure that Congress will be able to act if it so wishes. To be sure, we have no assurance that Congress will overrule a State's objec\u00ad tions and direct a repository to be built. However, I believe that if a majority of the Members of either House of Congress cannot be convinced that the plans for such a repository are adequate, then those plans should be improved before the repository is built. In sum, I believe that the process that Senator GLENN and I are proposing will enable us to select the best possible sites for repositories in the shortest time pos\u00ad sible, and gain public acceptance of those facilities. Our proposal recognizes that the primary obstacle to siting and devel\u00ad oping these facilities is public mistrust of the Federal Government. If we are to succeed in getting them built, the Fed\u00ad eral Government has no alternative but to work hard to regain the public's con\u00ad fidence. The measures we have suggested will ~nsure that the Federal Government will indeed work hard to produce the high level o{ results which the public deserves. Before closing, Mr. President, I would like to emphasize again that there are i;i.. number of other nuclear waste issues which must be addressed by this Con\u00ad gress. In particular, I believe that Con\u00ad gress must establish a funding mecha\u00ad nism which will ensure that the produc\u00ad ers of commercial nuclear wastes pay all of the costs of disposing of those wastes. I introduced legislation in the last ses\u00ad sion of Congress which would have estab\u00ad lished such a mechanism, and may re\u00ad introduce such legislation again during this session. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the text of the bill and a section-by-section summary of it be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the bill and summary were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: s. 742 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That this Act may be referred to as the \"Nuclear Waste Management Reorganization Act of 1979\".

Title III: Establishment, Membership and Functions of Nuclear Waste Coordinating Committee. Sec. 301. Establishes the Committee as an independent instrumentality of the U.S. in the Executive Branch. sec. 302. Membership. The Councll and all federal agencies with responsib111tles relat\u00ad ing to nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel management a.re to appoint representatives to the Committee. The DOE representative shall serve as Chairman. Sec. 303. 303(a.) The Committee ls to fa.cmtate co\u00ad ordination of federal activities with respect to nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel man- agement. . 303(b) The Committee ls to attempt to re\u00ad solve jurisdictional and scheduling disputes and to make recommendations on such mat\u00ad ters to the President where necessary. 303(c) The Committee is to prepare an an\u00ad nual Nuclear Waste Management Plan for each fiscal year through 1985. To the maximum extent feasible the Plan ls to Incorporate the views of all members of the Committee. If members disagree over the major provisions of the Plan, the draft Plan shall so indicate and shall include rele\u00ad vant options for Presidential consideration. The draft Plan shall be made available for public comment and shall then be submitted to the President, together with the views of the members of the Committee. The President may modify the draft Plan as necessary. In so doing, protection of the public health and safety ls to be foremost among the factors weighed. The Committee shall submit final version of the Plan to the Congress by March 1, 1980, and by March 1 of ea.ch succeeding year thereafter, through March 1, 1984. Congres\u00ad sional authorizing committees would then consider the Plan. 303(d) The committee ls to notify the Governor of a State of Federal plans to un\u00ad dertake studies in the State leading to the siting a nuclear waste or spent nuclear fuel repository or storage faclUty in that state. Thereafter, the Committee shall seek the views of appropriate agencies of any such State, and shall pel'>mit technical represent\u00ad atives of such States to participate 1n any federal technical analyses performed. 303 (e) Prior to the commencement of construction of a repository by any Federal agency or department, the Committee must prepare a Repository Development Report for that repository. The Report shall contain de\u00ad scriptions of the design and proposed oper\u00ad ating procedures of the proposed repository; safety and environmental analyses; plans for transporting nuclear wastes to the reposi\u00ad tory; and plans for providing federal impact aid or other assistance to States and locali\u00ad ties affected by It. \u00b7 It a Repository Review Panel has been convened with respect to the proposed re\u00ad pository pursuant to section 401, the Com\u00ad mittee ls to consult closely with the Panel while preparlng the Report. Upon completing the Repott, the Com\u00ad mittee shall submit it to the Review Panel. After a 90-day review period, the Chairman of the Panel (the Governor of the State containing the fa.c111ty) may sub\u00ad mit formal objections to the Report to the Committee Lf he believes that the Report does not adequately protect state and local interests. (See Section 403). The Commit .. tee must then submit the Report, together with such objections, if any, to the Congress. If the Chairman has not raised formal objections the appropriate federal agency may proceed with construction or licensing of the repository. If the Chairman has ra.i!_?ed objections, the construction or licensing of the re\u00ad pository may not pr()c~ed unless Congress passes a concurrent resolution, pursuant to the procedures set forth in section 304, stating that the Report equitably balances State, local, and national interests. If Congress does not pass the resolution within the 60 day period, construction or licensing of the repository may not proceed unless and until a revised Repository De\u00ad velopment Report has been prepared follow\u00ad ing the same procedures for preparation and review outlined above; and, either ( 1) the Chairman of the relevant Panel does not formally object to such revised Report or (2) if he does object, Congress passes a concurrent resolution (as above) with re\u00ad spect to the revised report. 303(f) Repository Loading Reports. Prior to the emplacement of significant quanti\u00ad ties of nuclear waste or spent nuclear fuel in a repository by any Federal agency or department, the Committee shall prepare a Repository Loading Report. The Repository Loading Report shall update the informa\u00ad tion contained in the relevant Repository Development Report. The Committee shall prepare such Loading Report in consultation with the Repository Review Panel formed with respect to that repository, and upon completing such Report shall submit it to the Panel for review. The Committee shall submit the complete Loading Report and the comments of the Review Panel on it to the Congress. The procedures for submit\u00ad ting and resolving formal objections of the Panel shall not apply in the case of Re\u00ad pository Loading Reports. Sec. 304. Congressional Review Procedures. Congress shall have 60 days of continuous session after receiving a Repository Develop\u00ad ment Report to which the Chairman of a Panel has objected in which to pass a con\u00ad current resolution stating that the Report equitably balances locail, State, and na.tiona.1 interests. Committees to which the Report is re\u00ad ferred shall have 45 days of continuous ses\u00ad sion to report such a resolution, after which they would be discharged from further consideration a! it. The Chairman of the Committee would be able to amend the Re\u00ad port !for the first 30 days of continuou~ ses\u00ad sion after its submission. Consideration of the resolution on the floors of both Houses would be under highly expedited pro\u00ad cedures. Sec. 305. Effect on Other Laws. The pro\u00ad visions of this Act sha.11 in no way affect the authority of the NRC to license waste fa.cllitles, nor shall it relieve any Federal department or agency of the requirements of the National Environmental Polley Act. Title IV: Establishment, Membership, and Functions of Nuclear Waste Repository Re\u00ad view Panels. Sec. 401. Estebllshment of Nuclear waste Repository Review Panels. Within 120 days after receiving notification of the Commit\u00ad tee's intent to prepare a Repository Devel\u00ad opment Report for a repository in his state, the Governor of the State may form a nuclea.r waste Repository Review Panel. The Repository Review Panel would re\u00ad 'ma.ln convened untH such time as the com\u00ad mittee formally notifies the Panel that the federal government no longer intends to con\u00ad struct or operate such proposed repository, or until such time as the Committee noti\u00ad fies the Panel that a Repository Loading Re\u00ad port prepared with respect to such reposi\u00ad tory ha.s been submitted to the Congress pursuant to section 303. Sec. 402. Membership. A Repository Re\u00ad view Panel would consist of the Governor convening the Panel, who would be its Chairman; seven additional State and local government omclals and private citizens from that State to be appointed by the Governor; the Governors Of any adjacent State or States which would be directly af\u00ad fected by the development of the repository in question, to be appointed by the Nu\u00ad clear Waste Management Plianning Council; and three representatives ftrom each such adjacent State to be appointed by the re\u00ad spective Governor of that State. Sec. 403. Functions. The Repository Re\u00ad view Panel would review current and planned federal actions regarding the sit\u00ad ing, construction, and operation of the relevant proposed repository, and would par\u00ad ticipate in the preparation of the Reposi\u00ad tory Development Report for the reposioory and would, within 90 days a.fter receipt of the Repository Development Report, \u00b7 ascer\u00ad tain whether the Report adequately provided for the protection Of State and local in\u00ad terests. At the end of that 90 day period, the Chairman of the Panel, after corurulta\u00ad tion with other Panel members, could sub\u00ad mit to the Committee forma.l objections that the Repository Development Report does not adequately provide for the protection of State and local interests. The Chairman would state the grounds for his decision and propose amendments to the Repository Development Report. The Repository Review Panel would par\u00ad ticipate in the preparation of and would comment on -any Repository Loading Report prepared for such repository. SENATE RESOLUTION 119-SUBMIS\u00ad SION OF A RESOLUTION TO ELIM\u00ad INATE CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON THE APPOINTMENT OF FE\u00ad MALE SENATE PAGES Mr. PROXMIRE (for himself, Mr. JAVITS, Mr. BAUCUS, Mr. BAYH, Mr. BRADLEY, Mr. CHAFEE, Mr. COCHRAN, Mr. DECONCINI, Mr. DURENBERGER, Mr. EAGLETON, Mr. GRAVEL, Mr. HATCH, Mr. HEINZ, Mrs. KAsSEBAUM, Mr. LEAHY, Mr. LEVIN, Mr. MATSUNAGA, Mr. METZENBAUM, Mr. MORGAN, Mr. MOYNIBAN, Mr. PERCY, Mr. PRESSLER, Mr. RANDOLPH, Mr. RIEGLE, Mr. STAFFORD, Mr. TSONGAS, and Mr. WEICKER) submitted the following res\u00ad olution, which was referred to the Com\u00ad mittee on Rules and Administration: S. RES. 119 Resoltved,, That Senate Resolution 112, 92d Congress, agreed to on May 13, 1971, ls amended by striking out the second sentence thereof. Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, the senior Senator from New York <Mr. JAVITS) and I with the 25 cosponsors named hereafter, are introducing today a resolution to remove a restriction on the employment of female pages here in the Senate-a restriction that applies only to the young women who wish to become pages, not to the young men. Twenty-five of our colleagues have added their names to this resolution as cosponsors. At this time I send to the desk a ropy of the resolution. As you may already know, a Senator wishing to hire a female page must, ac\u00ad cording to Senate Resolution 112, passed in 1971, file an agreement with the Sergeant at Arms stating that the Senator-March 28, 1979 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 6597 Will be responsible !or the sate transporta\u00ad tion of the female page he appoints between the Senate and the page's place o! local abode and return; and Will assume full responsib111ty !or the safety, well-being and strict supervision o! such female page while such page is in her place of local abode. Even though he may take a sincere personal interest in her well-being, a busy Senator cannot possibly oversee a female page's daily trips to and from the Senate. Nor can he supervise her activi\u00ad ties away from the Senate. According to the American Law Divi\u00ad sion of the Library of Congress, there is no provision for shifting this responsibil\u00ad ity to the parents by waiver, and a Sen\u00ad ator in all likelihood would be liable for an injury that might occur while the fe\u00ad male page is under his supervision. At the end of the last session, of the 30 Senate pages only 4 were female. The House of Representatives, which does not have this restriction on the use of fe\u00ad male pages, had 22 girls out of a total of 56pages. It is clear that many of our colleagues would appoint young women if it were not for the legal responsibility, which is virtually impossible for us to meet. Obvi\u00ad ously, the current system is unfair to the many girls who would enjoy and profit from the great experience of work\u00ad ing in the U.S. Senate. In place of current rules we suggest eliminating all special requirements for female pages concerning arrangements for transportation, lodging and well-be\u00ad ing. As a practical matter a Senator may wish to establish with the page and his or her parents guidelines for the page's liv\u00ad ing arrangements and transportation. The Senator may even sign an agree\u00ad ment with the parents accepting certain responsibilities. That should be up to the parties involved. But to require that a Senator accept full responsibility for any page is unrealistic, and to limit such re\u00ad sponsibility ~o female pages is discrimi\u00ad natory. Under rule L (50) adopted by the Sen\u00ad ate and put into effect with this Con\u00ad gress, a Senator may not discriminate in his employment practices on the basis of sex. The requirement of senatorial re\u00ad sponsibility in Senate Resolution 112, which applies only to females, is clearly discriminatory, and the Senate should move immediately to correct this bias. The few young ladies who have worked as pages here in the Senate since 1971 have-like all our pages--done a mar\u00ad velous job. We could not do without our pages, and I hope to see more young women among them in the future. I would like to mention that the Sen\u00ad ator from New York was the first among us to appoint a female page, and he has long pushed for fair treatment of women at all levels. Mr. President, I hope that my col\u00ad leagues will support this resolution and give young women the same chance to be be a page as we give to young men. Mr: President, this resolution is co\u00ad sponsored, in addition to Senator JAVITS and myself, by Mr. BAUCUS, Mr. BAYH, Mr. BRADLEY, Mr. CHAFEE, Mr. COCHRAN, Mr. DECONCINI, Mr. DURENBERGER, Mr. EAGLETON, Mr. GRAVEL, Mr. HATCH, Mr. HEINZ, Mrs. KASSEBAUM, Mr. LEAHY, Mr. LEVIN, Mr. MATSUNAGA, Mr. METZENBAUM, Mr.. MORGAN, Mr. MOYNIHAN, Mr. PERCY, Mr. PRESSLER, Mr. RANDOLPH, Mr. RIEGLE, Mr. STAFFORD, Mr. TSONGAS, and Mr. WEICKER. Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, today Senator PROXMIRE and I, with others of our colleagues, are submitting a resolu\u00ad tion to eliminate the responsibility clause applicable only to female pages. Under the terms of Senate Resolution 112, adopted by the Senate in 1971, young women for the first time could be pages in the Senate. But any Sena\u00ad tor appointing a female page must file with the Sergeant at Arins a written statement that he or she will be respon\u00ad sible for her safe transportation to and from the Senate and will assume full responsibility for her safety, well-being, and strict supervision while she is in her place of local abode. It is this re\u00ad quirement that the resolution we in\u00ad troduce today would eliminate. I ask unanimous consent that the sec\u00ad ond sentence of Senate Resolution 112, which our resolution would eliminate, be printed in the RECORD at this time: In the case of Senate pages, however, until such time as the fireproof building con\u00ad taining dormitory and classroom fa.c111ties, as a.uthorized by section 492 of the Legis\u00ad lative Reorganization Act of 1970, is con\u00ad structed and the pages are living under ap\u00ad proprtate supervision in such building, the sergeant a.t Arms of the Senate shall promulgate and have in effect regulations !or the appointment of pages of the senate requiring that no fema.le page shall be ap\u00ad pointed by a senator until the Senator files with the Sergeant at Arms a written state\u00ad ment accompanying such appointment that the sena.tor- ( l) will be responsible for the safe trans\u00ad portation of the female page he appoints between the Senate and the page's plaice of local a.bode and ireturn; and (2) will assume full responsib111ty for the safety, well-being, and strict supervision of such female page while such page is in her place of local abode. In 1971 I introduced, along with Sena\u00ad tors PERCY and Harris and other co\u00ad sponsors, a resolution to permit the ap\u00ad pointment of female pages. The Rules Committee amended the resolution to require, until such time as a dormitory were constructed, that Senators assume the special responsibility for female pages that I have outlined here. During the floor debate on the resolution, I stated my opposition to this discrimina\u00ad tory provision. But I reali\"ed that the matter would be hotly contested and long protracted if we did not accept the special responsibility clause. So we agreed to the amendment, in order that I, and Senators PERCY and Harris, could go ahead with the appointment of fe\u00ad male pages who had been waiting months for their appointments. Eight years have gone by, and we have seen many female pages perform their duties admirably. I am confident, though, that many other young ladies would also have had the opportunity to be pages were it not for the chilling effect of the special responsibility clause. No matter how interested we are in the well-being of our pages, both female and male, the realities of the situation are such that no Senator can assure at all times the strict supervision of pages. We can only advise the parents, as I do with male and female pages alike, on appropriate living situations in Wash\u00ad ington. Pages I have appointed have lived with relatives or with family friends or even with families arranged through a church. No matter what the living ar\u00ad rangement, I and my staff are always available to these young men and women as friend and guide for whatever assist\u00ad ance they may need while living away from home. I feel this approach is a much more appropriate one for the young men as well as the young women, given the realities of the situation. As my colleagues know, I have long supported equal opportunities for women. I feel it is important that we redress at this time this small, but sig\u00ad nificant impediment to providing such equal opportunities. I urge my colleagues to give this resolution their every con\u00ad sideration. A UNITED NATIONS REMINDER OF GENOCIDE Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, on March 17, the U.N. Commission on Hu\u00ad man Rights terminated its 35th session. Over the 5 weeks during which the Com\u00ad mission met, individual abuses of human rights played the dominant role in their discussions. Included in the session were a record 9 days of debate dealing with charges of human rights violations in a number of countries. Among those charged with human rights violations were, in varying degrees, the Govern\u00ad ments of Uganda, Ethiopia, Korea, Equi\u00ad torial Guinea, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Indonesia. Mr. President, when records are set in the amount of time spent de\u00ad bating human rights violations, it is clear that this terrible problem is not being solved. Our country considers hu\u00ad man rights one of the most important issues of our time. Yet, the first and fore\u00ad most international treaty on human rights, the Genocide Convention, has yet to be ratified by the Senate. Are we a leader in the crusade to abol\u00ad ish genocide? Can our country truly speak on human rights with authority? I am afraid the answer is a painful \"no\". It is both inconsistent and hypocritical that we advocate the elimination of gen-. ocide, when we have not taken action to ratify the only international treaty\u00b7 which serves to prevent the most horrible and destructive of crimes. It is now 30 years since the Genocide Convention was first taken up by the Senate. Another session of the U.N. Com\u00ad mission on Human Rights has met and reminded us that human rights violations continue in abundance. There has never been a more opportune moment for us to 6598 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE March 28, 1979 reamrm our belief in the crucial and fundamental importance of eradicating genocide. We must ratify the Genocide Convention. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further morning business? ORDER FOR RECESS UNTIL 12 NOON TOMORROW Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in recess until the hour of 12 noon tomorrow. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ROBERT c. BYRD. Mr. President, are we still in morning business? The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are. Mr. ROBERT c. BYRD. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen\u00ad ator from South Carolina. Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, will the Senator yield 3 seconds to me? Mr. HOLLINGS. I am delighted to yield. STATEMENT ON H.R. 2534, TO PRO\u00ad VIDE A TEMPORARY INCREASE IN THE PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, on March 27, 1979, the Senate approved by a vote of 62 yeas to 33 nays H.R. 2534. This legislation would provide for a \"temporary\" increase of $38 billion in the public debt limit, making the total debt limit $836 billion. Mr. President, I voted nay on this bill because the national debt is already dan\u00ad gerously high. Dimcult as it may be, we must stop this continuous upward spiral and begin to reduce spending so that sur\u00ad plus funds may be used to reduce the debt. The interest alone on the public debt for fiscal year 1979 will be over $50 billion. It horrifies me to realize that this is approximately one-tenth of our yearly budget. I have introduced legislation that calls for a constitutional amendment requir\u00ad ing a balanced Federal budget and con\u00ad tains provisions for repayment of the debt. I hope that such an amendment can be adopted. Finally, Mr. President, let me say that I have voted for years against extend\u00ad ing the debt limit. I voted against ex\u00ad tending the debt limit on March 27, and I am going to vote in the future against extending it. We must bring this situa\u00ad tion to a head. I realize that some will say that fail\u00ad ure to raise the limit will precipitate a financial crisis, that we will be in the situation in which New York and Cleve\u00ad land have found themselves. Maybe that is what we need. Nothing else has been able to get our attention focused prop\u00ad erly on fiscal responsibility. I thank the distinguished Senator. STATEMENT OF POSITION ON THE HART AMENDMENT REGARDING EARNED INCOME Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Senate earlier ooday voted on the Hart amendment regarding the honoraria issue with respect to senatorial focome. On last even\\ng, we were prepar~ to vote on that amendment. I was scJ:wduled to ta~ before the National Assqciati9n of Broadcasters in Dallas, Tex. Tqe plane was to leave last evening at 7 o'clock. Last night it was stated that the Hart amendment was to be brought up today. The vote was close. My position was known as opposing the Hart amendment. I left for Texas early this morning in order to make the speaking engagement. I had stayed on, I had the feeling that perhaps the vote would be put off at least until the time for my flight to ar\u00ad rive in Washington at 5 o'clock this evening. I understand from the leadership that other Senators had other exigencies. My flight arrived late, and I missed the vote. But, I believe the important thing is that each Senator's individual position should be known. I support the increase, if it is consid\u00ad ered an increase, or keeping the limit as it was, staying this year, in 1979, as scheduled for last year, 1978. I think the $25,000 limitation is rea\u00ad sonable. It does not interfere with sena\u00ad torial duties. I had the highest voting record in 1978 of anybody in the South Carolina delegation, over 94 percent, and yet I made the full limit of $25,000. Mr. President, I think what is really involved is the matter of actually listing from whence the honoraria are derived, to whom the Senators are speaking, what groups, and what have you, and once that is published, which occurs regularly, a Senator's supporters, his voters, his electorate, his constituency can, in tum, make up their minds as to what is un\u00ad due, undeserved, or disruptive of sena\u00ad torial duties. On the basis that we are not limiting earned income, a gentleman who gradu\u00ad ated from agricultural school can oper\u00ad ate his farms on the weekend. I did not happen to go to an agricultural school. I went to law school. I make talks, Mr. President, and I ac\u00ad tually learn more from talking than sit\u00ad ting around on weekends, and other oc\u00ad casions, when I am offered an opportu\u00ad nity to meet others of greater talents and experience. I travel the country in that way, and learn greatly from the ex\u00ad change of ideas and individuals with whom I discuss these issues. I think it has enhanced my capability as a Senator. I would have debated long and hard to kill any kind of Hart amendment, to go back to that silly limitation somebody is writing about in Common Cause and edi\u00ad torials. Mr. President, although my vote would not have changed the outcome of the Senate's action today, I believe I ought to make my position known. I thank the leadership for according me this oppor\u00ad tunity. ORDER FOR RECOGNITION OF SEN\u00ad ATOR. WALLOP AND PERIOD FOR ROUTINE MORNING BUSINF.sS TO\u00ad MORROW Mr. ROBERT c. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on tomor-row~ after the two leaders have been rec\u00ad ogmzed under the standing order, the Senator from Wyoming <Mr. WALLOP) be recognized for not to exceed 15 min\u00ad utes, that there then be a brief period for the transaction of routine morning business of not to exceed 15 minutes, and that Senators be permitted to speak therein up to 5 minutes each. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. PROGRAM Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, are there orders for recognition of Sen\u00ad ators tomorrow, other than the order for the recognition of Senator WALLOP? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair has no record of other orders. Mr. ROBERT c. BYRD. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, tomorrow, following morning business, the Senate will prob\u00ad ably tum to the conference rePort on the Taiwan legislation. Mr. CHURCH has in\u00ad dicated he would like to call that up early tomorrow. It is a privileged matter, being a conference report, so he will pro\u00ad ceed to take that up. Following that, I would like to take up the wage and price stability measure. There is a budget waiver resolution, which is Calendar Order No. 52, which would be called up prior to that. It will be my guess that there will be some rollcall votes tomorrow. RECESS Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, if there be no further business to come before the Senate, I move, in accordance with the order previously entered, that the Senate stand in recess until the-hour of 12 noon tomorrow. The motion was agreed to, and at 7: 06 p.m., the Senate recessed .until Thursday, March 29, 1979, at 12 meridian.
