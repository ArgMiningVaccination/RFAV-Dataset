Typically, thisspecies feeds over streams, bays, along thecoast, over lava flows, oratforest edges. Hawaiian hoary bats have alsobeen documented using forest gaps andclearings, season onHawai'i Island, andmigrated tointerior highlands during thenon-breeding season. Limited data suggest breeding may primarily occur atlower elevations, at3,300 feet(1,000 feet.Although theHawaiian hoary batmay occasionally disperse (Menard 2001). Hawaiian hoary canrange among habitats andelevations intreefoliage, andhave only rarely been seen exiting lava tubes, leaving cracks inrock walls, orhanging from human-made structures. Wind Power 2013). Hawaiian hoary bats have also been observed using night roosts torestafter foraging orseek shelter from rain(Todd 2012). tousenight roosts toserve several potential functions forbats: energy conservation, digestion, predator avoidance, information transfer, andsocial interactions (Kunz 1982).

Hawaiian hoary bats weigh about 45percent less than mainland hoary bats, which areopen area foragers (Fenton 1990), andthissmaller body mass leads tolower wing loading andanincreased aptitude forflying inboth open andmore cluttered environments (Jacobs 1996), hoary also usehigh-intensity components, which isconsistent with forest 3-3Auwahi Wind Farm Project Habitat Conservation Plan Amendment edge habitat foraging behavior.

Typically, thisspecies feeds over streams, bays, along thecoast, over lava flows, oratforest edges. Hawaiian hoary bats have also been documented using forest gaps andclearings, forest edges, along season onHawai'i Island, andmigrated tointerior highlands during thenon-breeding season.

Although thePCMP isimplemented todocument anypotential impacts willberecorded forinformational purposes. Additionally, although survey efforts willfocus ondocumenting mortality through standardized searches, allinjuries andmortality associated with theproject (e.g., vehicle strikes) willbe documented. 1\u20141Auwahi Wind Farm Project Post-Construction Monitoring Plan 1.2 OFTHE PCMP Wind farm-related fatality estimation isbased onthenumber ofcarcasses found carcass searches conducted under operating WTGs. Both thelength oftime carcasses remain onsitebefore being removed byscavengers ofsearchers tolocate carcasses (searcher efficiency) canbias thenumber standardized searches. Therefore, thisPCI\\4P includes 1)methods forconducting standardized carcass searches tomonitor potential injuries orfatalities associated with Project operation, 2)carcass removal trials toassess seasonal, site-specific carcass removal rates byscavengers orother means, and 3)searcher efficiency carcasses. Vegetation conditions alsowillbeassessed anddocumented aspartofthemonitoring protocol when conducting carcass searches andcarcass removal andsearcher efficiency trials. The proposed field andanalytical methods areconsistent with post-construction monitoring being conducted, orproposed, forother wind projects and may bemodified asproject-specific information isobtained tomaximize effectiveness andefficiency ofthemonitoring program (e.g., search interval, thenumber ofWTGs searched, plot size). Additionally, recent advancements inthescience ofpost-construction monitoring have resulted invariations inthestandard monitoring protocol based onsite-specific conditions atindividual wind farms, ofinterest, study available over thelong term. Any recommended changes totheprotocol from thebaseline (DOFA~. permits required toimplement themonitoring program willbeobtained, including theUSFWS Special Purpose Permit andtheDOFAW Protected Wildlife Permit. These permits grant permission andinclude provisions forhandling wildlife andcarcasses. They willbe required forhandling anynative wildlife carcasses used inthesearcher efficiency andcarcass removal trials described below, unless other legal species, such aschickens areused. 1-2Auwahi Wind Farm Project Post-Construction Monitoring Plan 2.0 STANDARDIZED CARCASS SEARCHES The objective ofthestandardized carcass searches istosystematically search WTG locations for avian andbatcasualties carcass searches todocument avian andbatfatalities willbegin During searches beneath each ofthe Project's 8WTG (Table Weekly searches willbeconducted from March Surveys willbeconducted twice perweek from Julythrough November thatincludes thepetrel fledgling totheendofNovember).

Therefore, more intensive monitoring isproposed forthis period. The purpose ofthebi-weekly search interval forbats istominimize efficiency.

The PCMP data may provide justification formodifying search plot size, search frequency, orthe number ofWTGs sampling efforts ofyear during subsequent years ofmonitoring. These datawillalsoillustrate trends in searcher efficiency and carcass removal over time. Should thedocumented searcher efficiency drop below anaverage of50percent, Auwahi Wind will collaborate with theUSFWS andDOFAW todevelop alternative search strategies (e.g., intensive vegetation dogs). Asearcher efficiency along-term monitoring approach consisting ofperiodic intensive monitoring followed byinterim years oflessintensive butsystematic monitoring. Intensive monitoring would occur every 5years after theinitial 2-year intensive sampling period (i.e., years inatotal of6years ofintensive monitoring during thelifeoftheProject (Table 7-1). During intensive monitoring years, searcher efficiency trials and carcass removal trials would beconducted todetermine ifanyvariables have changed over time andifanymodifications tosearch frequency arerequired (Table 7-1). During interim confidence intheestimate oftake, orother lessfrequent basis. The frequency at which thesurveys take place during interim years willbedetermined attheconclusion ofthecarcass removal trials forthat 5-year period. Itisassumed that searcher efficiency trials may have conducted more frequently depending onchanges instaff.

Under the approved Project Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP; Tetra Tech 2012), Auwahi Wind Energy, LLC (Auwahi Wind) committed toconducting Intensive Monitoring during thefirst 2years ofProject operations, after which time initial post-construction mortality monitoring data andother site- specific considerations would manage themonitoring outlines over ofthe20year operating oftheProject's 25-year Incidental Take Permit (ITP)/Incidental while theturbines ofwind farm post- construction mortality monitoring since 2012 have been incorporated asappropriate. The approach tolong-term mortality monitoring consists ofSystematic Monitoring throughout the remainder ofthepermit term while turbines mortality takelimits under theITP/ITL. Estimated take accounts forobserved direct take, unobserved direct take, andindirect take. These terms aredefined asfollows anddescribed indetail inSection 2: plots designed toinclude themajority oflarge bird andbatfatalities. Search plots centered on Project wind turbines. Bias correction trials conducted (searcher efficiency andcarcass persistence). Data used toestimate take forIntensive Monitoring periods. Systematic Monitoring\u2014Standardized carcass searches conducted within refined search plots excluding hazardous areas totraverse (roads andpads within 328feet [100 meters] of turbines).

Systematic Monitoring provides opportunities todocument temporal changes inannual fatality rates. Systematic Monitoring will continue until results reveal predictable patterns offatalities, atwhich point annual compliance reports (Tetra Tech 2013; Auwahi Wind 2014b, 2015).

Rein etal.(2014) does indicate, however, that even though theresults were notstatistically significant theestimated mortality rateforthe6.5rn/s treatment waslower than the5.0rn/s treatments.

The appendix isprovided to give additional detail ontheestimation process. The current standard forfatality estimation when theannual level islow (i.e., lessthan study parameters toaccount forfatalities thatmay have been missed during used tocalculate thedirect take using EoA isprovided. here assumes thereader isfamiliar with Evidence ofAbsence andhasa familiarity with statistics. The estimate oftotal Project-related take includes thetake currently authorized under respectively, andarenotdiscussed 2.0 DIRECT TAKE TheEoA software package was used tomodel potential fatality levels (direct take only) over the20- year operating period oftheITP/ITL based onProject-specific fatality data andtoestimate a requested takelimit.

Thecredibility level represents thelikelihood that thepredicted mortality exceeds theactual mortality. The alpha bythefunction: Credible level =100% *(1 \u2014alpha) H-2Auwahi Wind Farm Project Habitat Conservation Plan Amendment This means that analpha value of0.2isequal toacredible level of80percent. Project-related takefortheHCP Amendment also uses thisvalue. This results inhigher take estimates with greater certainty thatactual mortality islessthan estimated mortality. The 80percent credible level means there isan80percent probability that actual mortality isequal toorlessthan thepredicted mortality. The 80percent credible level includes post-construction monitoring conducted attheProject andplanned monitoring efforts forfuture years were incorporated into theEoA TheProject-specific data occurrence forvarious potential future take scenarios. Themodel runs 10,000 simulations from the observed data andtheoutput provides thelevels areafunction oftheuser-defined credibility level, observed fatalities, andpast andprojected future monitoring Auwabi Wind selected Batfatalities andbiascorrection data recorded during post-construction mortality monitoring surveys conducted during 5years ofProject operation were assumed toberepresentative ofbaseline fatality trends expected over theITP/ITL permit term andprovided input values thatwere incorporated into themodel. Inputs include thenumber ofobserved fatalities, searcher efficiency andcarcass persistence data, andtheproportion ofthecarcass distribution searched togetthe overall Fortheremaining years ofoperation within thepermit term (2018\u2014 2032), model input parameters were estimated based ondata collected under thecurrent monitoring protocol (assumptions described further below). Input parameters areshown inTable 5-1ofthe HCP Amendment. These model software tomodel thepredicted credible mortality andestimated mortality within EoA. The mean take estimate was 120, or7lessthan the127direct take estimate atthe8O% credible level forallscenarios among projects with triggering (i.e.EoA indicates take exceeded thepermitted amount). H-3Auwabi Wind Farm Project Habitat Conservation Plan Amendment Several assumptions were made todevelop input parameters fortheremaining years oftheITP/ITL permit term, The willcontinue detection probability (g)willremain consistent throughout theProject's ITP/ITL permit term. Model input values forthese parameters were based onthe2018 monitoring, as current conditions areassumed tobest represent ongoing monitoring. TheProject assumes minimization willbe effective atreducing future take. Based onthemodel inputs andassumptions described above, theEoA software analysis estimates total selected from the75th quantile oftheprojections offuture where minimization measures result ina30percent reduction intake.

Acquisition ofthis historic property would provide awide range of public benefits, from increasing water recharge to aquifers that supply drinking water, topreserving open space, and providing access tomauka recreational opportunities. Theupper elevations ofKamehamenui contain native subalpine shrublands that areimportant habitat for numerous species, Biological surveys willbeconducted toinventory existing natural resources and assess existing threats tothis unique native plant community. Thelower two-thirds oftheproperty primarily contains pasture that iswell suited forreforestation with ecologically andeconomically valuable species such as koa (Acacia koa) and sandalwood (Santalum haleakalae var.haleakalae). restoration iscompleted, weconservatively increased recharge rates based onvalues from adjacent forested areas. Based onour GIS calculation, we estimate that habitat management and reforestation efforts at Kamehamenui will increase water production to 4.19 MGD, which translates into anadditional miles ofpublic access trails and isalso a popular hunting area. Also contained within theFR isthePolipoli Springs State Recreation Area, avery popular camping destination.

The lower elevations ofKamehamenui arewellsuited to reforestation with ecologically and economically valuable species such askoaandsandalwood, which aresome ofthehighest valued ofallHawaii's forest products and canbemanaged under sustainable selective harvesting prescriptions compatible with ecological function. With thehelp ofinterns and volunteers, theDivision and itspartners have already successfully outplanted 150,000 native trees inonleeward Haleakal\u00e3 within theNakula Mountain.
