Though seemingly unrelated\u2014and arguably contradictory\u2014all of these topics are united under Generation Z's [revival](https://www.panmacmillan.com/blogs/lifestyle-wellbeing/the-popularity-of-astrology) of New Age spirituality as well as their socially progressive tendencies. Members of Generation Z are [making](https://religionnews.com/2021/08/11/study-gen-z-doubles-down-on-spirituality-combining-tarot-and-traditional-faith/) the practice of Tarot reading widespread again, the use of healing crystals has been [featured](https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/tbalance-crystal-jewellery) in Vogue and promoted by celebrities like Bella Hadid and Kylie Jenner, and astrology has become a lucrative industry [thanks](https://harpersbazaar.com.au/why-are-people-obsessed-with-astrology/) to Generation Z consumers. At the same time, Generation Z [composed](https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-commanding-lead-gen-z-millennials-barely-registers-baby-boomer-democratic-voters-1484395) much of Bernie Sanders'\u2014a strong [supporter](https://berniesanders.com/issues/medicare-for-all/) of universal healthcare\u2014voter base during the 2020 United States presidential election, and [demonstrated](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/11/gen-z-fall-trumpism-gop-realignment-424171) great pushback against Donald Trump's presidency. Left-leaning members of Generation Z now helm the progressive movement of the 2020s. However, despite [being](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/01/17/generation-z-looks-a-lot-like-millennials-on-key-social-and-political-issues/) a generally progressive social group, Generation Z may not realize crystals and astrology may be diverting their attention from the quest for healthcare and autonomy. Herein lies the tension between crystals and capitalism. New Age spirituality is not a religion, per se, but a wide and fluid [system](https://revisesociology.com/2018/09/25/new-age-movement-what/) of beliefs inspired by the values and practices of Buddhism, Taoism, paganism, and other spiritual philosophies. In theory, New Age spirituality very closely aligns with the typically left-leaning values of Generation Z: followers [can](https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/legal-and-political-magazines/new-age-spirituality) mix and match religious beliefs according to their own lifestyles; they can focus on self-improvement; and they can see the universe as the determining factor of life's course. There is emphasis on nature, with followers turning to holistic methods and items with 'healing' properties like crystals for wellness purposes. While Generation Z is certainly entitled to these beliefs, there is a deeper story behind the recent resurgence of New Age ideas. Generation Z is a generation of its own, for better and for worse. Generation Z [is](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230215-are-gen-z-the-most-stressed-generation-in-the-workplace) globally one of the most stressed generations in the workplace, especially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the instability of the job market. According to the Walton Foundation, American members of Generation Z are twice as likely to [experience](https://www.waltonfamilyfoundation.org/stories/foundation/generation-z-is-waging-a-battle-against-depression-addiction-and-hopelessness) depression as compared to Americans over the age of 25. American members of Generation Z generally [hold](https://www.newsweek.com/majority-gen-z-americans-hold-negative-views-capitalism-poll-1604334) negative views toward capitalism. As Generation Z struggles to find its footing in an extremely volatile society and economy\u2014particularly in the United States\u2014they ostensibly can [acknowledge](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/20/eat-the-rich-why-millennials-and-generation-z-have-turned-their-backs-on-capitalism) the failures of capitalism and are willing to work toward social progress. This is exactly what young progressives believe they are doing. While young people [spearheaded](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccabellan/2020/06/12/gen-z-leads-the-black-lives-matter-movement-on-and-off-social-media/?sh=71c9bc9419a8) the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 and have [become](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/06/1154172568/gen-zs-political-power-new-data-gives-insight-into-americas-youngest-voters) some of America's most active voters, certain beliefs and practices entailed in New Age spirituality act as obstacles preventing full realization of social revolution. In other words, there are discrepancies between the leftists of Generation Z's New Age beliefs and practices and their political views\u2014failing to address them could set them back years in terms of social progress. The biggest barrier to social progress offered by New Age spirituality is its espousal of clemency. That is to say, New Age beliefs deprioritize accountability and immediate justice, opting to instead place the issues of now into a grand universal scheme. This is impractical for the average [progressive](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/05/14/on-the-cusp-of-adulthood-and-facing-an-uncertain-future-what-we-know-about-gen-z-so-far-2/) member of Generation Z\u2014it places less emphasis on radical action such as protesting and grassroots organizing, and more on resorting to placing faith in theoretical social democracy. Active voting may be important to a Generation Z individual, but it is not enough; for immediate issues such as the now [approved](https://abcnews.go.com/US/willow-project-confirmed-despite-protests-experts-explain-young/story?id=97742724) Willow Project, an oil drilling project in Alaska which will have devastating environmental consequences, hoping elected representatives make choices representative of their constituents is not enough to prevent the government from backtracking on environmental initiatives. Concrete action is needed, and it cannot be left up to individual worldviews. Generation Z should be forcefully making their voices heard, whether through protest or through denouncing a system of government which does not accurately represent the needs and beliefs of its people. Clemency cannot be a universally-applicable solution to political injustice, and the spiritual members of generation Z cannot let their religious beliefs clash with their political ones. Another obstacle to social progress posed by New Age spirituality is the appropriation of holistic healthcare methods. While some [exploit](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/pictures/gwyneth-paltrows-most-controversial-goop-moments/) holistic methods for profit with little proof of their effectiveness, when the concept of homemade healthcare is exclusive of public healthcare, one of Generation Z's most important issues is disregarded\u2014the fight for universal healthcare. The basic concept of universal healthcare is to [provide](https://www.who.int/health-topics/universal-health-coverage#tab=tab_1) people with high-quality healthcare from well-trained professionals. Even with the fact that varying methods of holistic healthcare, such as acupuncture and homeopathy, can [cost](https://www.talktomira.com/post/how-much-do-holistic-treatments-cost-without-insurance) up to $600 per session, the advocacy for household cures ignores the accountability of governments across the world, but especially the United States, for making quality, proven-effective healthcare inaccessible. When simply eating a balanced diet can be [impossible](https://www.vox.com/videos/2018/3/22/17152460/healthy-eating-expensive) for low-income families, they should not be pointlessly tasked with solving their own medical problems. It is up to Generation Z to demand their governments protect their citizens and provide them with an acceptable standard of living, no less life itself. At-home remedies cannot be a solution to systemic inequality. A smaller\u2014or, rather, less outwardly noticeable\u2014hypocrisy included within the Generation Z practice of New Age spirituality includes the actual act of purchasing healing crystals. The crystal industry has planted solid roots in the global economy, with special thanks to New Age consumers. The mining of crystals is [part](https://newrepublic.com/article/148190/know-healing-crystals-come-from) of the multi-billion dollar mining industry, [known](https://blog.whistleblowersecurity.com/blog/safety-in-the-mining-industry-an-overview) to be extremely unsafe for workers and often unethical with the widespread [use](https://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/Miningandquarrying/MoreaboutCLinmining/lang--en/index.htm.) of child labor. Young leftists advocate for the abolition of child labor and the expansion of labor rights, yet unwittingly contribute to the perpetuation of antiquated and illegal institutions. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with New Age spirituality. For Generation Z who grew up and are living in some of the most socially and politically tumultuous times of the 21st century, it is to be expected that young leftists seek forgiving, flexible spiritual philosophies\u2014while they have no flexibility in their work lives, no economic wiggle room, and no time to pause their fight for social justice lest certain groups be silenced or disenfranchised, they turn toward introspection and homemade remedies for their literal and figurative ills. Yet, turning a blind eye to social issues cannot be equated to letting life take its course. If the left-leaning members of Generation Z do not confront the discrepancies between their spiritual beliefs and their sociopolitical beliefs, they may end up supporting a system they are against. Young members of Generation Z who consider themselves spiritual must reconcile their ideals with their material surroundings on small and large scales in order to live up to their revolutionary reputation.
