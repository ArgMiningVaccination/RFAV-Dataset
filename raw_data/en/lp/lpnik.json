This Summary of Benefits, as updated, is subject to the approval of the California Department of Insurance and the California Department of Managed Health Care (as applicable). In addition to the benefits described in this summary, coverage may include additional benefits, depending upon the member's home state. The benefits provided in this summary are subject to federal and California laws. There are some states that require more generous benefits be provided to their residents, even if the master policy was not issued in their state. If the member's state has such requirements, we will adjust the benefits to meet the requirements. All medical services subject to a coinsurance are also subject to the annual medical deductible. Annual Out-of-Pocket Maximums includes deductible, copays, coinsurance and prescription drug. In network and out of network deductible are inclusive of each other. For plans with an office visit copay, the copay applies to the actual office visit and additional cost shares may apply for any other service performed in the office (i.e., X-ray, lab, surgery), after any applicable deductible.

Members may be responsible for any amount in excess of the reasonable and customary value. If your plan includes an emergency room facility copay and you are directly admitted to a hospital, your emergency room facility copay is waived. If your plan includes out of network benefit and you use a non-network provider, you are responsible for any difference between the covered expense and the actual non-participating providers charge.
