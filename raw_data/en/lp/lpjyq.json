Choose a tea, tincture, or supplement below for extra drive, vigour, and get-up-and-go when you need it most. There are many herbs that can promote energy and vitality, in different ways - for example, by providing much-needed vitamins and minerals to your cells (or improving their absorption), by offering antioxidant protection to prevent negative impacts of pollution and environmental stressors on your body, by promoting a healthy blood circulation to effectively bring oxygen and nutrition to your brain, or by helping your body systems continue to function healthily in situations of stress, like [adaptogens](https://www.zenmaitri.com/blogs/news/adaptogen-guide)do. To find the best natural approach for you, we recommend [speaking with a medical herbalist](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/natural-health-consultation)so that they can devise a bespoke prescription for you. For example, [ashwagandha](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/ashwagandha-capsules)is an excellent tonic to promote energy and vitality, which improves our resilience to stress. There is also an impressive and steadily growing amount of research on medicinal mushrooms that are able to boost immunity, energy and vitality, including reishi, lion's mane, maitake and chaga, which are all included in our [Mushroom Power Mix](https://www.zenmaitri.com/collections/energy/products/mushroom-power-mix). We have also concocted an uplifting smoothie powder made with natural stimulants and adaptogens to increase your endurance and support recovery after exertion: our [Energy Mix](https://www.zenmaitri.com/collections/energy/products/energy-mix). This blend includes Siberian ginseng, maca and schisandra berries, which improve mental and physical performance and protect the body from the effects of physical and emotional stress. To promote healthy circulation, we've included antioxidant-rich hawthorn berries and bilberries. Last but not least we have rose hips and Balinese moringa, abundant sources of the vitamins and minerals you need to prevent fatigue and raise your energy levels. Although naturally stimulating, this mix does not contain any caffeine - so it's perfect for your morning smoothie or shake. We recommend taking it in the mornings, and on alternate days if you are training at the gym. A natural stimulant for energy is a natural ingredient which can naturally and safely help increase your energy levels. For example, Siberian ginseng is a famous natural energy booster. It improves mental and physical performance and helps to protect against the effects of stress. It has been used to increase energy and vitality for millennia. It improves digestion and absorption of nutrients, promotes healthy cholesterol and triglycerides levels, enhances immunity, protects the liver and regulates blood sugar levels. It increases blood flow to the brain and improves memory, concentration and mental stamina. With its powerful anti-fatigue effect, Siberian ginseng increases endurance and the ability of the mitochondria in the cells to produce energy. It does not contain any caffeine, so it provides natural stimulation. Siberian ginseng is one of the key ingredients of our non-caffeinated but energy-boosting [Good Morning Tea](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/good-morning-tea)and [Energy Mix](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/energy-mix). If you drink a lot of caffeinated drinks, it is a great idea to replace some of your intake with herbal alternatives, to decrease some of the side effects you may be experiencing from caffeine and to help you relax and sleep better. You can for example use our non-caffeinated [Good Morning Tea](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/good-morning-tea)- a delicious, healthy, energising but non-caffeinated morning drink. It is a blend of warming, metabolism-boosting spices, mineral-rich nettle powder and anti-fatigue Siberian ginseng. It'll help enhance your energy levels and support your physical and mental resilience for the day ahead. You can also add some of our [Energy Mix](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/energy-mix)or [Rise and Shine Mix](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/rise-and-shine-mix)to your morning smoothie or shake. Ginger is a great natural remedy for fatigue. It is warming and stimulates circulation and digestion. It promotes blood flow and oxygenation throughout the body. It has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine to enhance the 'fire' in the body, which is seen as responsible for good digestion, visual perception, the lustre of the skin, the light of the eyes, the clarity in the mind, determination and courage. This makes ginger a great addition to a morning drink to get you going! It is one of the ingredients of our [Rise and Shine Mix](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/rise-and-shine-mix), a non-caffeinated natural mix to help get your day off to an invigorating start. It will taste great in your morning smoothie! The best supplements for energy are those that are 100% natural, not containing any heavily processed, artificial, hard-to-pronounce ingredients, and whose high-quality ingredients can safely promote energy and vitality, without overly stimulating the body and mind, which can be counter-productive. For example, our natural [Energy Supplements](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/energy-capsules)were designed to enhance alertness and endurance, and to support recovery after exertion. This blend of energising and adaptogenic herbs includes Bilberry, Moringa, Maca, and Siberian Ginseng. It naturally promotes optimal mental and physical performance - without the caffeine! Although these can offer some general support, it is also important to know that there can be a wide range of reasons why you may need help to increase your energy levels (e.g., specific nutrient deficiencies), so to find the best natural approach for you, we recommend [speaking with a medical herbalist](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/natural-health-consultation)so that they can assess your case in depth and devise a bespoke prescription for you. To help combat fatigue, we recommend taking supplements which are rich in vitamins and minerals that are essential to the healthy functioning of your nervous system, which improve blood flow to help bring oxygen and nutrients to all of your cells, which promote better nutrient absorption in your digestive system and and which have natural antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties. Our [Energise supplements](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/energy-capsules)tick all of these boxes and more. They contain an uplifting blend of herbs to fight fatigue and naturally reinvigorate mind and body. There are many natural energy boosters. A good example is Siberian ginseng. A famous natural energy booster, Siberian ginseng improves mental and physical performance and helps to protect against the effects of stress. It has been used to increase energy and vitality for millennia. It improves digestion and absorption of nutrients, promotes healthy cholesterol and triglycerides levels, enhances immunity, protects the liver and regulates blood sugar levels.

Delicious herbal teas which can promote energy and dispel fatigue without any caffeine do exist! For example, our [Good Morning Tea](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/good-morning-tea)is a tasty, healthy, energising but non-caffeinated morning drink. It is a blend of warming, metabolism-boosting spices, mineral-rich nettle powder and anti-fatigue Siberian ginseng. It'll help enhance your energy levels and support your physical and mental resilience for the day ahead. We shouldn't need artificial stimulation from energy drinks and caffeine to have good energy levels every day. It is possible to have healthy energy levels by eating a varied diet of nutritious food with plenty of fruits and vegetables, a balance of work and play, exercise and relaxation, sufficient sleep, a minimum of pollution in our environment and the cultivation of practices to engender peace of mind. For a natural, non-caffeinated boost, there are many herbs and fungi that can help promote energy and vitality, in different ways - for example, by providing much-needed vitamins and minerals to your cells (or improving their absorption), by offering antioxidant protection to prevent negative impacts of pollution and environmental stressors on your body, by promoting a healthy blood circulation to effectively bring oxygen and nutrition to your brain, or by helping your body systems continue to function healthily in situations of stress, like [adaptogens](https://www.zenmaitri.com/blogs/news/adaptogen-guide)do. Our [Energise [Ashwagandha supplements](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/ashwagandha-capsules)are all very helpful to naturally improve energy levels without artificial stimulation.
