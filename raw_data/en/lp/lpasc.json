EUCRI SAis for topical use only and not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use . 3DOSAGE FORMS AND STR Ointment: 20 mg of crisaborol e per gram (2%) of white to off -white ointment. 4CONTRAINDICATIONS EUCRI SA is contraindicated in patients with known hy persensitivity to crisaborole or an y component of the formulation .[see Warnings and Precautions (5. 1) ] 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including c ontact urticaria ,haveoccurred in patients treated with EUCRI SA. Hy persensitivity should be suspected in the event of severe pruritus, swelling and erythema at the application site or at a distant site. If signs and s ymptoms of hy persensitivity occur, discontinue EUCRI SAimmediatel yand initiate appropriate therapy . 6ADVERSE REACTIONS 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely vary ing condition s, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In two double -blind, vehicle -controlled clinical trials (Tr ial 1 and Trial 2), 1012 subjects 2 to 79 years of age with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis were treated with EUCRI SA twice daily for 4 weeks. The adverse reaction reported by 1% of EUCRI SA-treated subjects is listed in Table 1. Table 1:Adverse Reac tion Occurring in 1% of Subjects in through Week 4 Adverse ReactionEUCRISA N=1012 n(%)Vehicle N=499 n (%) Application site paina45 (4) 6 (1) aRefers to skin sensations such as burning or stinging. Less common (<1%) adverse reactions in subjects treated with EUCRI SA included contact urticaria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Page 3of 98USE IN SPECIFIC POPU LATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There is no available data with EUCRI SAin pregnant women to inform the drug -assoc iated riskfor major birth defects and miscarriage .In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects observed with oral administration of crisaborole inpregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 5and 3times, respectively , the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) [ see Data ]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies carry some risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15 %to 20% of clinicall y recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Rat and rabbit embry o-fetal development was assessed after oral administration of crisaborole . Crisaborole did not cause adverse effects to the fetus atoraldoses up to 300 mg/kg/day in pregnant ratsduring the period of organogenesis (5 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis). No treatment -related fetal malformations were noted af ter oral treatment with crisaborole in pregnant rats at dose sup to 600 mg/kg/day (18 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis) during the period of organogenesis. Maternal toxicit y was produced at the high dose of 600 mg/kg/day in pregnant rats and was associated with findings of decreased fetal body weight and delayed skeletal ossification. Crisaborole did not cause adverse effects to the fe tus at oral doses up to the highest dose tested of 100 mg/kg/day in pregnant rabbits during the period of organog enesis (3 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis). In a pr enatal/postnatal development study , pregnant rats were treated with crisaborole at doses of 150, 300 ,and 600 mg/kg/day by oral gavage during gestation and lactation (from gestation day 7 throug h day 20 of lactation). Crisaborole did not have an y adverse effects on fetal development at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day (18 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis). Maternal toxicity was produced at the high dose of 600 mg/kg/day in pregnant rats and w as associated with findings of stillbirths, pup mortality ,and reduced pup weights. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information ava ilable on the presence of EUCRI SAin human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the d rug on milk production after topical application of EUCRI SA to women who are breastfeeding . EUCRI SA is systemic ally absorbed. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of EUCRI SA to a breastfed infant .Therefore, the development aland health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for EUCRI SAand Page 4of 9any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from EUCRI SAor from the underly ing maternal condition. 8.4 Pediat ric Use The safet y and effectiveness of EUCRI SA have been established in pediatric patients age 2 years and older for topical treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. Use of EUCRI SA in this age group is supported by evidence from two multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, vehicle -controlled 28 -day trials which included 1,313 pediatric subject s2 years and older [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14) ]. The safety and effectiveness of EUCRI SAin pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of EUCRISA did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differentl y from younger subjects white to off -white ointment andisfor topical use. The active ingredient, benzoxaborole. The empirical formula is C 14H10BNO 3andthemolecular weight is 251. 1 g/mol . The structural formula is represented below: OBOH ONC Crisaborole drug substance is freel y soluble in common organic solvents such as isoprop yl alcohol a nd prop ylene gly col, and insoluble in water. Each gram of EUCRI SAcontains 20 mg of crisaborole in an ointment containing white petrolatum, prop ylene y which crisaborole exerts i ts therapeutic action for the treatment of atopic dermatitis is not well defined .Page 5of 912.2 Pharmacodynamics At therap eutic doses, EUCRI SA ointment is not expected to prolong QTc to any clinicall y relevant extent . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmaco kinetics (PK) of EUCRI SA were investigated in 33pediatric subjects 2 to 17 years of age with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis and a mean \u00b1 SD bod y surface area involvemen t of 49 \u00b1 20% (range 27% to 92% ). In this study ,subjects applied approximatel y 3 mg/cm2of EUCRI SA ointment (dose range wasapproximatel y6g to 30gper application ) twice dail y for 8 day s. Plasma concentrations were quantifiable in all the subjects. The mean \u00b1 SD maximum plasma concentration (C max) and area under the concentration t ime curve from 0 to 12 hours post dose (AUC 0-12)for crisaborole on Day 8 Systemic concentrations of crisaborole were at steady state by Day 8. Based on the ratios of AUC 0-12 between Day 8 and D ay 1, the mean accumulation factor for crisaborole was 1. 9. Distribution Based on an in vitro study ,crisaborole is 97% bound to human plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism Crisaborole is substantially metabolized into inactive metabo lites. metabolites which 5 -(4- cyanophenoxy )-2-hydroxy l benzoic acid (metabolite 2), formed is also a major metabolite. PK of metabolites 1 and 2 were assessed in the PK study described above and the systemic concentrations were at or near stead y state by Day 8. Based on the ratios of AUC 0-12 between Day 8 and Day 1, the mean accumulation factor s for metabolites 1 and 2 were 1.7 and 6. 3,respectively . Excretion Renal excretion of metabolites is the major route of elimination.Page 6of 9Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that under the conditions of clinical use,crisaborole and metabolite 1 are not expected liver microsomes studies for metabolite 2 showed that it did not inhibit activities of CYP2C19, 2D6 ,and 3A4 ; was a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2 and 2B6; and a moderate inhibitor of and 2C9 . The most sensitive enzy me, CYP2C9, was further investigated in a clinical trial using warfarin as a CYP2C9 substrate. The results of this study showed no drug interaction potent ial. In vitro studies in human hepatocy tes showed that under the conditions of clinical use , crisaborole and metabolites 1 and 2 are not expected CYP enzy mes. 13NONCLINICAL TOXICOLO GY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, In an oral carcinogenicity study in Sprague -Dawley rats, oral doses of 30, 100 ,and 300 mg/kg/day crisaborole were administered to rats once dail y. A drug -related increased incidence of benign granular cell tumors in the uterus with cervi xor vagina (com bined) was noted in 300 mg/kg/day crisaborole treated female rats (2 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis). The clinical r elevance of this finding is unknown. In a dermal carcinogenicity study in CD -1 mice, topical doses of 2%, 5% and 7% crisaborole ointment were administered once daily . No drug -related neoplastic findings were noted at topical doses up to 7% crisaborole ointment (2 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis). Crisaborole revealed no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic potential ba sed on the results of two in vitro genotoxicity tests (Ames assay and human ly mphocy te chromosomal aberration assay test (rat micronucleus assay ). No effects on fertility were observed in male or female rats that were admini stered oral doses up to 600 mg/kg/day crisaborole (18 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis) prior to and during early pregnancy . 14CLINICAL STUDIES Two multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, vehicle -controlled trials (Trials 1 and 2) treated a total of 1522 subjects 2 to 79 y ears of age ( 86.3% of subjects were 2 to 1 7 years of age) with a 5% to 95% t reatable bod y surface area . At baseline, 38.5% of the subjects had an Investigator's Static Global Assessment [I SGA] score of 2 (mild) ,and 61.5% had an ISGA score of 3 (moderate) ,in the overall assessment of atopic dermatitis (ery thema, induration/papulation, and oozing/crusting) on a severit y scale of 0 to 4. In both trials, subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive EUCRI SA or vehicle a pplied twice daily for 28 day s. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects at Day 29 Page 7of 9who achiev edsuccess, defined as an ISGA grade of Clear (score of0) or Almost Clear (score of1) with a 2-grade or greater improvement from baseline , comparing EUCRI SA-treated subjects to vehicle -treated subjects . Efficacy results from the two trials are summarized in Table 2.
